Written in 1915. In
    early 1916, Lenin, while in Berne, sent the manuscript to Maxim
    Gorky for the Parus Publishers, but it did not appear at that time. It
    was published in Petrograd in 1917 by Zhisn i Znaniye. The
    material for the book–variants of the plan and statistical extracts
    from the U.S. Census reports for 1900 and 1910–was published in
    Lenin Miscellany XIX in 1932. Lenin did not realize his intention
    of writing the second part of the book, which was to have dealt with
    Germany.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America




   

   


A leading country of modern capitalism is of especial
interest to the study of the socio-economic structure and evolution of
present-day agriculture. The U.S.A. is unrivalled either in the rate of
development of capitalism at the turn of the century, or in the record
level of capitalist development already attained; nor has it any rival in
the vastness of the territory developed with the use of the most up-to-date
machinery, which is adapted to the remarkable variety of natural and
historical conditions or in the extent of the political liberty and the
cultural level of the mass of the population. That country, indeed, is in
many respects the model for our bourgeois civilization and is its
ideal.

The study of the forms and laws of agricultural evolution is made
easier in the U.S.A. by its decennial censuses of population, which are
coupled with remarkably detailed descriptions of all industrial and
agricultural enterprises. This yields a wealth of exact information that is
unavailable in any other country; it helps to verify many popular notions,
most of which are very loosely formulated and repeated without criticism,
and usually serve to funnel bourgeois views and prejudices.

Mr. Himmer in the June (1913) issue of
Zavety[3] gives some data
from the latest, Thirteenth (1910) Census, and on this basis reiterates the
most popular and thoroughly bourgeois contention—bourgeois both as
regards its theoretical basis and political significance—that
“the vast majority of farms in the United States employ only family
labour”; that “in the more highly developed areas agricultural
capitalism is disintegrating”; that “in the great majority of areas
. . . small-scale farming by owner-operators is becoming ever more
dominant”; that it is precisely “in the older cultivated

   

areas with a
higher level of economic development” that “capitalist
agriculture is disintegrating and production is breaking up into smaller
units”; that “there are no areas where colonization is no longer
continuing, or where large scale capitalist agriculture is not decaying and
is not being replaced by family-labour farms”, and so on and so
forth.

All these assertions are monstrously untrue. They are in direct
contradiction to reality. They are a sheer mockery of the truth. Their
incorrectness ought to be explained in detail for a very good reason:
Mr. Himmer is not the man in the street, he is not a casual contributor of
a casual magazine article, but one of the most prominent economists
representing the most democratic, extreme Left-wing bourgeois
trend in Russian and European social thinking. That is precisely why
Mr. Himmer’s views may have, and indeed already have among some
non-proletarian sections of the population, particularly wide circulation
and influence. They are not merely his personal views, nor his individual
mistakes, but are rather an expression—couched in the most democratic
terms and heavily embellished with pseudo-socialist phraseology—of
general bourgeois views which in the atmosphere of a capitalist
society are most readily accepted both by the smug professor, treading the
beaten path, and the small farmer who is more intelligent than millions of
his fellows.

The theory of the non-capitalist evolution of agriculture in capitalist
society, which Mr. Himmer advocates, is really the theory of the great
majority of bourgeois professors and bourgeois democrats and also of
opportunists in the labour movement of the whole world who are the latest
variety of those selfsame bourgeois democrats. It is no exaggeration to say
that this theory is an illusion, a dream, a delusion under which the whole
of bourgeois society is labouring. In devoting my further exposition to the
refutation of this theory, I shall try to give a complete picture of
capitalism in American agriculture, because one of the main mistakes made
by bourgeois economists is to isolate facts and figures, major and minor,
from the general context of politico-economic relations. All my data are
taken from official statistical publications of the United States of North
America, including above all the volumes Five, devoted to agriculture, of
the Twelfth and Thirteenth censuses taken in

   

1900 and 1910 respectively,
[1]

and also the
Statistical Abstract of the United States for 1911. Having
mentioned these sources, I shall not give references to pages or tables for
each separate figure, as this would only burden the reader and needlessly
encumber the text; anyone interested enough will easily find the data in
question from the tables of contents in these publications.


   

1. General Characteristic of the Three
Main Sections.


The Homestead West
The vast area of the United States, which is only slightly smaller than
the whole of Europe, and the great diversity of farming conditions in the
various parts of the country make absolutely imperative a separate study of
the major divisions, each with its peculiar economic status. American
statisticians adopted five geographical divisions in 1900, and nine in
1910:


(1) New England—six states on the Atlantic coast in the north-east (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut);

(2) Middle Atlantic (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)—in 1900 these two divisions formed the North Atlantic division;

(3) East North Central (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin);

(4) West North Central (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas)—in 1900, the last two made up the North Central division;

(5) South Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida)—unchanged from 1900;

(6) East South Central (Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi);

(7) West South Central (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas)—in 1900, the last two made up the South Central division;

(8) Mountain (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada); and

(9) Pacific (Washington, Oregon, and California)—in 1900, the last two made up the Western division.

The excessive patchwork of these divisions prompted American
statisticians in 1910 to compress them into three main sections—the North
(1-4), the South (5-7) and the West (8-9). We shall presently see that this
division into three main sections is really most important and vital,
although here, too, as in everything else, there are transitional types, so
that on some basic points New England and the Middle Atlantic states will
have to be considered separately.

In order to define the fundamental distinction between the three main
sections, let us designate them as the industrial North, the
former slave-owning South and the homestead West.

Here are the figures on their area, percentage of improved[2]

land, and population:

   Sections 
 
  Total Land Area  (000,000 acres)  
  Percentage of  improved land  
  Population  (1910)  (000,000)
   The North

  56
   The South
  562

   The West
  753

   The U. S. A.
  1,903

  92
 
The North and the South have approximately the same area, while the
West is nearly half as large again as either. The population of the North,
however, is eight times that of the West, which, one might say, is hardly
populated. How rapidly it is being settled is evident from the fact that in
the 10 years between 1900 and 1910, the population in the North increased
by 18%; the South, by 20%; and the West, by 67%! There is hardly any
increase in the number of farms in the North: 2,874,000 in 1900, and
2,891,000 in 1910 (+0.6%); in the South the number increased by 18%, from
2,600,000 to 3,100,000; and in the West, by 54%, i.e., more than half as
much again, from 243,000 to 373,000.

How land is being settled in the West is seen from the data on
homesteads, which are parcels of land, mostly of 160 acres, i.e., about 65
dessiatines, allocated by the government free of charge or at a nominal
price. In the 10 years between 1901 and 1910, the area occupied by
homesteads in the North was 55.3 million acres (including 54.3 million,
i.e., more than 98%, in one division alone, namely the West North Central);
the area in the South was 20 million acres (including 17.3 million in one
division, the West South Central), and in the West, it was 55.3 million
acres spread over both divisions. This means that the West is a solid
homestead area, i.e., one where unoccupied land is given away practically
free—somewhat similar to the squatter land tenure in the outlying
districts of Russia, except that it is not regulated by a feudal state, but
in a democratic manner (I very nearly said: in a Narodnik manner; the
American Republic has implemented in a capitalist way the “Narodnik”
idea of distributing unoccupied land to all applicants). The North and the
South, however, each have only one homestead division, which may be
regarded as a transitional type from the unsettled West to the settled
North and South. Let us note, by the way, that only in two divisions of the
North—the New England and the Middle Atlantic—were there absolutely no
homestead grants made in the last decade. We shall later have to return to
these two most highly industrialized divisions, where there is no longer
any homesteading at all.

The above figures on homesteads refer only to claims that have been
staked and not to those actually settled; we have no figures on the latter
for the various divisions. But even if these returns are somewhat
exaggerated as absolute magnitudes, they are, at any rate, a faithful
reflection of the relative importance of homesteads in the various
divisions. In the North in 1910 the farms totaled 414 million acres, so
that homestead claims in the last 10 years came to about one-eighth of the
total; in the South, about one seventeenth (20 out of 354); and in the
West, one-half (55 out of 111)! To lump together data on areas
with hardly any land ownership at all, and data on areas where all the land
is occupied, would be to make nonsense of scientific investigation.

America provides the most graphic confirmation of the truth emphasized by
Marx in
Capital,[4] Volume
III, that capitalism in agriculture does not depend on the form of land
ownership or land tenure. Capital finds the most diverse types of medieval
and patriarchal landed property—feudal, “peasant allotments”
(i.e., the holdings of bonded peasants); clan, communal, state, and other
forms of land ownership. Capital takes hold of all these, employing a
variety of ways and methods. For agricultural statistics to be properly and
rationally compiled, the methods of investigation, tabulation, etc., would
have to be modified to correspond to the forms of capitalist
penetration into agriculture; for instance, the homesteads would have to be
put into a special group and their economic fate traced. Unfortunately,
however, the statistics are all too often dominated by routine and
meaningless, mechanical repetition of the same old methods.


How extensive agriculture is in the West, as compared with the other
sections, is evident, by the way, from the data on expenditures for
artificial fertilizers. In 1909, the expenditure per acre of improved land
was 13 cents ($0.13) in the North; 50 cents, in the South, and only 6 cents
in the West. The South has the highest figure because cotton demands great
quantities of fertilizers, and the South is primarily a cotton-growing
area: cotton and tobacco account for 46.8% of the total value of all its
farm crops; grain, only 29.3%; hay and forage, 5.1%. By contrast, grain
leads in the North with 62.6%, followed by 18.8% of hay and forage, most of
which is cultivated. In the West, grain accounts for 33.1% of the total
value of all farm crops; hay and forage, with wild grasses predominating,
31.7%, while fruits, a special branch of commercial farming rapidly
developing on the Pacific coast, account for 15.5% of the total value.

      land, (2) woodlands and (3) all other unimproved land. Improved
      land includes all land regularly tilled or mowed, land pastured
      and cropped in rotation, land lying fallow, land in gardens,

      2. The Industrial North
By 1910, the urban population in the North reached 58.6% of the total,
as compared with 22.5% in the South and 48.8% in the West. The role of
industry is evident from these figures:

    

         
  Value of products ($000,000,000)
  Workers in  industry  (000,000)  
   Crops  
  Live-  stock

   The U. S. A. 
  5.5
  3.1
  8.6
  8.5

The total crop value is here overstated because a part of the crops,
such as feed, recurs in the value of the livestock products. But in any
case these figures show conclusively that almost five-sixths of American
manufacture is concentrated in the North, and that manufacture prevails
over agriculture in that section. The South and the West, on the contrary,
are predominantly agricultural.

The above table shows that the North differs from the South and the
West by a comparatively greater development of industry, which creates a
market and makes for the intensification of agriculture. The
North—“industrial”  in that sense—nevertheless still
remains the largest producer of agricultural products. More than one-half,
actually about three-fifths, of agricultural production, is concentrated in
the North. How much more intensive farming is in the North, as compared
with the other sections, will be seen from the following figures on the
per-acre value of all farm property—land, buildings, implements and
machinery, and livestock. In 1910, it was $66 in the North, as compared
with $25 in the South, and $41 in the West. The per-acre value of
implements and machinery alone was $2.07 in the North, $0.83 in the South,
and $1.04 in the West.

The New England and Middle Atlantic divisions stand out in this
picture. As I have already pointed out there is no new homesteading in
these parts. From 1900 to 1910, there was an absolute decrease in the
number of farms, and in the total and in the improved acreage of the
farms. Employment returns show that only 10% of the population there is
engaged in farming, as compared with a 33% average for the U.S.A., 25 to
41% for the other divisions of the North, and 51 to 63% for the South. Only
6 to 25% of the improved acreage in these two divisions

    

is under cereal
crops (the average for the U.S.A. is 40%, and for the North, 46%); 52 to
29% is under grasses, mostly cultivated (as against 15% and 18%); and 4.6
to 3.8% is under vegetables (as against 1.5 and 1.5%). This is the area of
the most intensive agriculture. The average expenditure for fertilizers per
acre of improved land in 1909 was $1.30 and $0.62 respectively; the former
being the U.S. maximum, and the latter, second only to that of one division
in the South. The average value of implements and machinery per acre of
improved land was $2.58, and $3.88—the maximum figures for the U.S.A. We
shall later see that in these most industrialized divisions of the
industrial North, agriculture is the most intensive and has the most
pronounced capitalist character.

## The Former Slave-Owning South









Lenin: 1915/newdev: 3. The Former Slave-Owning South







V. I.  

      Lenin
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

3. The Former Slave-Owning South 
The United States of America, writes Mr. Himmer, is a “country
which has never known feudalism and is free from its economic
survivals”  (p. 41 of his article). This is the very opposite of the
truth, for the economic survivals of slavery are not in any way
distinguishable from those of feudalism, and in the former slave-owning
South of the U.S.A. these survivals are still very powerful. It
would not be worth while to dwell on Mr. Himmer’s mistake if it were
merely one in a hastily written article. But all liberal and all Narodnik
writings in Russia show that the very same “mistake”  is being
made regularly and with unusual stubbornness with regard to the Russian
labour-service system, our own survival of feudalism.

The South of the U.S.A. was slave-owning until slavery was swept away
by the Civil War of 1861-65. To this day, the Negroes, who make up no more
than from 0.7 to 2.2% of the population in the North and the West,
constitute from 22.6 to 33.7% of the population in the South. For the
U.S.A. as a whole, the Negroes constitute 10.7% of the population. There is
no need to elaborate on the degraded social status of the Negroes: the
American bourgeoisie is in no way better in this respect than the
bourgeoisie of any other country. Having “freed”  the Negroes,

    

it took good care, under “free”, republican-democratic
capitalism, to restore everything possible, and do everything possible and
impossible for the most shameless and despicable oppression of the
Negroes. A minor statistical fact will illustrate their cultural
level. While the proportion of illiterates in 1900 among the white
population of the U.S.A. of 10 years of age and over was 6.2%, among the
Negroes it was as high as 44.5%! More than seven times as high! In the
North and the West illiteracy amounted from 4 to 6% (1900), while in the
South it was from 22.9 to 23.9%! One can easily imagine the complex of
legal and social relationships that corresponds to this disgraceful fact
from the sphere of popular literacy.

What then is the economic basis that has produced and continues to
support this fine “superstructure” ?

It is the typically Russian, “purely Russian”  labour
service system, which is known as share-cropping.

In 1910, Negroes owned 920,883 farms, i.e., 14.5% of the total. Of the
total number of farmers, 37% were tenants; 62.1%, owners; the remaining
0.9% of the farms were run by managers. But among the whites 39.2% were
tenant farmers, and among the Negroes—75.3%! The typical white farmer in
America is an owner, the typical Negro farmer is a tenant. The proportion
of tenants in the West was only 14%: this section is being settled, with
new lands unoccupied, and is an El Dorado (a short-lived and unreliable El
Dorado, to be sure) for the small “independent farmer” . In the
North, the proportion of tenant farmers was 26.5%, and in the South, 49.6%!
Half of the Southern farmers were tenants.

But that is not all. These are not even tenants in the European,
civilized, modern-capitalist sense of the word. They are chiefly
semi-feudal or—which is the same thing in economic terms—semi-slave
share-croppers. In the “free” West, share-croppers
were in the minority (25,000 out of a total of 53,000 tenants). In the old
North, which was settled long ago, 483,000 out of 766,000 tenant farmers,
i.e., 63%, were share-croppers. In the South, 1,021,000 out of 1,537,000
tenant farmers, i.e., 66%, were share-croppers.

 
In 1910, free, republican-democratic America had 1,500,000
share-croppers, of whom more than 1,000,000 were
Negroes. And the proportion of share-croppers to the total number of
farmers is not decreasing, but is on the contrary steadily and rather
rapidly increasing. In 1880, 17.5% of the farmers in the U.S.A. were
sharecroppers, in 1890, 18.4%; in 1900, 22.2%; and in 1910, 24%.

American statisticians draw the following conclusions from the 1910 returns:

“In the South the conditions have at all times been
somewhat different from those in the North, and many of the tenant farms
are parts of plantations of considerable size which date from before the
Civil War.”  In the South, “the system of operation by
tenants—chiefly colored tenants—has succeeded the system of operation
by slave labour. . . . The development of the tenant system is most
conspicuous in the South, where the large plantations formerly operated by
slave labour have in many cases been broken up into small parcels or tracts
and leased to tenants. . . . These plantations are in many cases still
operated substantially as agricultural units, the tenants being subjected
to a degree of supervision more or less similar to that which hired farm
labourers are subjected to in the North” (op. cit., Vol. V,
pp. 102, 104).

To show what the South is like, it is essential to add that its
population is fleeing to other capitalist areas and to the towns, just as
the peasantry in Russia is fleeing from the most backward central
agricultural gubernias, where the survivals of serfdom have been most
greatly preserved, in order to escape the rule of the notorious Markovs, to
those areas of Russia which have a higher level of capitalist development,
to the metropolitan cities, the industrial gubernias and the South (see
The Development of Capitalism in
Russia[1]

).

The share-cropping
area, both in America and in Russia, is the most stagnant area, where the
masses are subjected to the greatest degradation and oppression. Immigrants
to America, who have such an outstanding role to play in the
country’s economy and all its social life, shun the

    

South. In 1910,
the foreign-born formed 14.5% of the total population of America. But in
the South the figure was only l to 4% for the several divisions, whereas in
the other divisions the proportion of incomers ranged from not less than
13.9% to 27.7% (New England). For the “emancipated” Negroes,
the American South is a kind of prison where they are hemmed in, isolated
and deprived of fresh air. The South is distinguished by the immobility of
its population and by the greatest “attachment to the land” :
with the exception of that division of the South, which still has
considerable homesteading (West South Central), 91 to 92% of the population
in the two other divisions of the South resided in the same division where
they were born, whereas for the United States as a whole the figure was
72.6%, i.e., the mobility of the population is much greater. In the West,
which is a solid homestead area, only 35 to 41% of the population lived in
the division of their birth.

  
 Negroes are in full flight from the two Southern divisions
  where there is no homesteading: in the 10 years between the last
  two censuses, these two divisions provided other parts of the
  country with almost 600,000 “black”  people. The
  Negroes flee mainly to the towns: in the South, 77 to 80% of all
  the Negroes live in rural communities; in other areas, only 8 to
  32%. Thus it turns out that there is a startling similarity in
  the economic status of the Negroes in America and the peasants in
  the heart of agricultural Russia who “were formerly
  landowners’ serfs”.

## Average Size of Farms

      Lenin
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

4. Average Size of Farms, “Disintegration of Capitalism” in the South 
Having examined the chief distinctive features of the three main
sections of the U.S.A., as well as the general nature of their economic
conditions, we can now proceed to an analysis of the data most commonly
referred to. These are primarily data on the average acreage of farms. It
is on the basis of these data that a great many economists, including
Mr. Himmer, draw the most categorical conclusions.

    

 
 
Average acreage per farm in the U.S.A. 
 
Years

  All farmland

    Improved land
 
1850  1860

  202.6  199.2

    78.0  79.8
   
 
1870  1880  1890  1900  1910

  153.3  133.7  136.5  146.2  138.1

    71.0  71.0  78.3  72.2  75.2
 
On the whole, there seems at first glance to be a reduction in the
average acreage of all farmland and an uncertain fluctuation—upward and
downward—in the average improved acreage. But there is a distinct break
in the 1860-70 period and this I have indicated by a line. During that
period there was an enormous decrease in the average acreage of
all farmland by 46 acres (from 199.2 to 153.3) and the greatest change
(from 79.8 to 71.0), also a reduction, in the average acreage of improved
land.

What was the reason? Obviously, the Civil War of 1861-65 and the
abolition of slavery. A decisive blow was dealt at the latifundia of the
slave-owners. Further on we shall see repeated confirmation of this fact,
but it is so generally known that it is surprising that it needs any proof
at all. Let us separate the returns for the North and those for the South.

127.1  126.4

  65.4  68.3
 

 
  1870  1880  1890  1900  1910

    214.2  153.4  139.7  138.2  114.4

117.0  114.9  123.7  132.2  143.0

  69.2  76.6  87.8  90.9  100.3 
 
We find that in the South the average improved acreage per farm between
1860 and 1870 greatly decreased (from 101.3 to 69.2), and that in
the North it slightly increased (from 68.3 to 69.2). This means
that the cause lay in the specific conditions of evolution in the
South. There we find even

    

after the abolition of slavery, a reduction in the average acreage of
farms, although the process is slow and not continuous.

Mr. Himmer’s deduction is that in the South “the
small-scale family farms are extending their domination, while capital is
leaving agriculture for other spheres of investment. . . . Agricultural
capitalism is rapidly disintegrating in the South Atlantic
states. . .”.

This is an amusing assertion likely to be matched only in the arguments
of our Narodniks on the “disintegration of capitalism” in
Russia after 1861 in consequence of the landlords abandoning corvée
for the labour-service (i.e., semi-corvée!) system of economy. The
break-up of the slave-worked latifundia is called the “disintegration
of capitalism”. The transformation of the unimproved land of
yesterday’s slave-owners into the small farms of Negroes, half of
whom are share-croppers (it should be borne in mind that the proportion of
share-croppers has been steadily growing from census to census!),
is called the “disintegration of capitalism”. It is hardly
possible to go any further in distorting the fundamental concepts of
economics!

Chapter Twelve of the 1910 Census supplies information on typical
Southern “plantations”—not of the old slave period, but of
our own day. On the 39,073 plantations there are 39,073 “landlord
farms” and 398,905 tenant farms, or an average of 10 tenants per
landlord or “master”. Plantations average 724 acres, of which
only 405 acres is improved, more than 300 acres being unimproved, not a bad
reserve for the gentlemen who were the slave-owners of yesterday to draw on
in extending their plans of exploitation. . . .

Land on the average plantation is distributed as follows:
“landlord” farm—331 acres, of which 87 is
improved. “Tenant” farms, i.e., the parcels of the Negro
share-croppers, who continue to work for the master and under his eye,
average 38 acres, of which 31 is improved land.

As the population and the demand for cotton increase, the former
slave-owners of the South begin to parcel out their vast latifundia,
nine-tenths of the land on which is still unimproved, into small tracts
which are either sold to the Negroes or, more frequently, leased to them on
a half-crop basis. (From 1900 to 1910, the number of farmers in the

    

South
who were full owners of all their farmland increased from 1,237,000 to
1,329,000, i.e., 7.5%, while the number of share-croppers went up from
772,000 to 1,021,000, i.e., 32.2%.) And yet an economist has appeared who
says this is “disintegration of capitalism”. . . .

I designate as latifundia farms with an area of 1,000 acres and
over. In 1910, the proportion of such farms in the U.S.A. was 0.8% (50,135
farms), and they added up to 167.1 million acres, or 19.0% of the total
amount of land. This is an average of 3,332 acres per latifundium. Only
18.7% of their acreage was improved while for all farms the figure was
54.4%. The capitalist North has the smallest number of latifundia:
0.5% of the total number of farms accounting for 6.9% of the land, 41.1% of
which is improved. The West has the greatest number of latifundia: 3.9% of
the total number of farms accounting for 48.3% of the land; 32.3% of the
land in the latifundia is improved. But it is in the former slave-owning
South that the latifundia have the highest proportion of
unimproved land: 0.7% of the farms are latifundia; they account for 23.9%
of the land; only 8.5% of the land in the latifundia is improved!
Incidentally, these detailed statistics clearly show that there is really
no foundation for the common practice of classifying the latifundia as
capitalist enterprises, without a detailed analysis of the
specific data for each country and each area.

During the 10 years from 1900 to 1910, the total acreage of the
latifundia, but only of the latifundia, showed a decrease. The
reduction was quite substantial: from 197.8 million to 167.1 million acres,
i.e., 30.7 million acres. In the South, there was a reduction of 31.8
million acres (in the North, an increase of 2.3 million, and in the West, a
reduction of 1.2 million). Consequently, it is in the South, and in the
slave-owning South alone, that the latifundia, with their negligible
proportion (8.5%) of improved land, are being broken up on a really vast
scale.

The inescapable conclusion is that the only exact definition of the
economic process under way is—a transition from the slave-holding
latifundia, nine-tenths of which remained unimproved, to small
commercial agriculture. It is a transition

    

to commercial farms and
not to farms worked by family labour, as Mr. Himmer and the Narodniks,
together with all the bourgeois economists who sing cheap hymns to
“labour”, love to say. The term “family labour” has
no politico-economic meaning and is indirectly misleading. It is devoid of
meaning because the small farmer “labours” under any social
system of economy, be it slavery, serfdom or capitalism. The term
“family labour” is just an empty phrase, pure oratory which
serves to cover up the confusion of entirely different social
forms of economic organization—a confusion from which the bourgeoisie
alone stands to gain. The term “family labour” is misleading
and deceives the public, for it creates the impression that hired
labour is not employed.

Mr. Himmer, like all bourgeois economists, evades just these statistics
on hired labour, although they are the most important data on the question
of capitalism in agriculture and although they are to be found in the 1900
Census report, as well as in the 1910 Abstract—Farm Crops,
by States, which Mr. Himmer himself quotes (note on p. 49 of his
article).

The nature of the staple crop of the South shows that the growth of
small-scale agriculture in the South is nothing but the growth of
commercial farming. That crop is cotton. Cereals yield 29.3% of the total
crop value in the South; hay and forage, 5.1%; and cotton, 42.7%. From 1870
to 1910, the production of wool in the U.S.A. went up from 162 million
lbs. to 321 million lbs., i.e., it doubled; wheat, increased from 236
million to 635 million bushels, i.e., less than threefold; corn, from 1,094
million to 2,886 million bushels, also less than threefold; and cotton,
from 4,000,000 bales (of 500 lbs. each) to 12,000,000, i.e., threefold. The
growth of the crop that is primarily commercial was faster than that of
other, less commercialized, crops. In addition, there was in the main
division of the South, the South Atlantic, a rather substantial development
of tobacco production (12.1% of the crop value in the State of Virginia);
vegetables (20.1% of the total crop value in the State of Delaware, 23.2%
in the State of Florida); fruits (21.3% of the total crop value in the
State of Florida); etc. The nature

    

of all these crops implies an
intensification of farming, a larger scale of operations on smaller
acreages, and greater employment of hired labour.

I shall now proceed to a detailed analysis of the returns on hired
labour; let us note only that the employment of hired labour is also
growing in the South, although in this respect it lags behind the other
sections—less hired labour is employed because of the
wider practice of semi-slave share-cropping.

## The Capitalist Nature of Agriculture

V. I.  

      Lenin
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

  5. The Capitalist Nature of Agriculture 
Capitalism in agriculture is usually gauged by the data on the size of
farms or the number and importance of big farms (in terms of acreage). I
have examined some of these data and shall return to the problem later on,
but it must be said that all these are, after all, indirect indications,
for acreage is not always an indication, and not by any means a direct
indication, that a farm is really big as an economic enterprise,
or that it is capitalist in character.

In this respect the data on hired labour are far more indicative and
offer better proof. Agricultural censuses taken in recent years, such as
the Austrian of 1902 and the German of 1907, which I shall examine
elsewhere, show that the employment of hired labour in present-day
agriculture—and especially in small-scale farming—is much greater than
is generally believed. Nothing so obviously and categorically refutes the
petty-bourgeois myth about small “family” farms as do these
figures.

American statisticians have collected very extensive material on this,
for each farmer’s individual census form asks whether he spends
anything on hired labour, and, if he does, exactly how much. In contrast to
European statistics—such as those of the two countries just named—no
record is made in American statistics of the number of hired labourers
employed at the time by each farmer, although that could be easily
discovered, and the scientific value of such in formation, in addition to
the returns on the total expenditure on hired labour, would indeed be very
great. But the worst thing is the very poor tabulation of these returns in
the 1910 Census, which is in general presented much more poorly than the
1900 Census. The 1910 Census groups all

    

farms by acreage (as does the 1900
Census) but, by contrast, it does not give any figures on the employment of
hired labour by these groups. This makes it impossible for us to compare
the employment of hired labour by farms with small and with large
acreages. The Census merely gives the average figures for the states and
the sections, i.e., data lumping together capitalist and non-capitalist
farms.

I shall make a special point of going into the more elaborate data for
1900 later on; meanwhile, here are the figures for 1910; in fact they
relate to 1899 and 1909.

 
    Sections
 Percentage of farm hiring labour
      (1909)
 Increase of expenditure  on hired labour 1899-1909 (%)
 Expenditure on hire labour per acre of improved land ($)
 
    1909

      1899
 
    The North

      55.1

+ 70.8

  1.26

    0.82
 
    The South

      36.6

+ 87.1

  1.07

    0.69
 
    The West

  52.5

  +119.0

  3.25

  2.07
 

 
  The U. S. A.

  45.9

  + 82.3

  1.36

  0.86


The first thing that is made obvious by these figures is that
    agriculture is most capitalistic in the North (55.1% of farms
    employ hired labour); then, follows the West (52.5%) and, lastly,
    the South (36.6%). That is just as it should be when any densely
    populated and industrial area is being compared with an area still
    under going colonization and with an area of share-cropping. It
    goes without saying that figures on the proportion of farms
    employing hired labour are more suitable for a precise comparison
    of the sections than data on the expenditure on hired labour per
    acre of improved land. For the latter type of data to be
    comparable, the level of wages in the sections would have to be
    the same. No information on farm wages in the U.S.A. is available
    but in the light of the basic distinctions between the sections it
    is inconceivable that their wage levels are the same.

Thus, in the North and in the West—the two sections
    which together have two-thirds of the improved land and two-thirds
    of the livestock—more than one-half the farmers
    cannot manage without hired labour. The proportion is smaller in
    the South only because there the semi-feudal (alias

    

semi-slave)
    system of exploitation in the form of share-cropping is still
    strong. There is no doubt that in America, as in all the other
    capitalist countries, a part of the handicapped farmers have to
    sell their labour-power. Unfortunately, American statistics do not
    contain any information about this, in contrast, for example, to
    the 1907 German statistics, in which these data have been
    collected and worked out in detail. According to the German
    statistics, hiring themselves out as labourers is the
    main occupation of 1,940,867 persons, i.e., over 30%, of
    the 5,736,082 owners of farms (a total which includes the very
    small “owners”). To be sure, the mass of these
    farm-hands and day-labourers with a bit of land of their own
    belong to the poorest groups of farmers.

Let us assume that in the U.S.A., where the smallest farms (of
    less than three acres) are as a general rule not registered at
    all, only 10% of the farmers sell their labour-power. Even then we
    find that more than one-third of the farmers are
    directly exploited by the landlords and capitalists (24%
    share-croppers who are exploited by former slave-owners in feudal
    or semi-feudal fashion, plus 10% who are exploited by the
    capitalists, or altogether 34%). This means that of the total
    number of farmers a minority, hardly more than
    one-fifth or one-quarter, neither hire labourers nor hire
    themselves out or sell themselves into bondage.

Such is the actual state of affairs in the country of
    “model and advanced” capitalism, in the country with
    free distribution of millions of dessiatines of land. Here again
    the famous non-capitalist, small-scale “family”
    farming proves to be a myth.

How many hired labourers are engaged in American agriculture?
    Is their number increasing or decreasing in proportion to the
    total number of farmers and the total rural population?

It is regrettable that American statistics do not provide a
    direct answer to these highly important questions. Let us find an
    approximate answer.


Firstly, we can obtain an approximate answer
    from the returns on occupations (Volume IV of the Census
    reports). These stalistics are not an American
    “success”. They are

    

compiled in such a routine,
    mechanical, incongruous manner that they contain no information on
    the status of the persons employed, i.e., no distinction is made
    between farmers, family workers, and hired labourers. Instead of
    making a precise economic classification, the compilers were
    content to use “popular” terminology, absurdly
    bracketing members of farmers’ families and hired labourers
    under the head of farm workers. As we know it is not only
    in American statistics that there is complete chaos on this
    question.

The 1910 Census makes an attempt to bring some order into this
    chaos, to correct the obvious mistakes and to separate at least a
    part of the hired labourers (those working out) from members of
    the family working on the home farm. In a series of calculations
    the statisticians correct the total number of persons engaged in
    farming, reducing it by 468,100 (Vol. IV, p. 27). The number of
    females working out is set at 220,048 for 1900, and
    337,522 for 1910 (an increase of 53%). The number of males working
    out in 1910 was 2,299,444. Assuming that in 1900 the proportion of
    hired labourers to the total number of farm workers was the same
    as in 1910, the number of males working out in 1900 must have been
    1,798,165. We then obtain this picture:

 

 1900  
 1910  
 Increase  (%)
 
      Total engaged in agriculture  Number of farmers  Number of hired labourers

10,381,756  5,674,875  2,018,213

  12,099,825  5,981,522  2,566,966
 +16  + 5  +27
 
That is, the percentage increase in the number of hired
    labourers was over five times greater than in that of farmers (27%
    and 5%). The proportion of farmers in the rural population
    decreased; the proportion of hired labourers
    increased. The proportion of independent farm operators
    to the total farming population dropped; the number of dependent,
    exploited persons, increased.

In 1907, hired farm labourers in Germany numbered 4.5 million
    out of a total of 15 million persons working on the home farm and
    working out. Consequently, 30% were hired labourers. In America,
    according to the estimate given above, the figure was 2.5 million
    out of 12 million, i.e., 21%. It is possible that the availability
    of vacant

    

land distributed free, and the high percentage of share
    cropping tenants tended to lower the percentage of hired labourers
    in America.

Secondly, an approximate answer may be provided by the figures
    on expenditure on hired labour in 1899 and 1909. During the same
    period, the number of industrial wage-workers increased from 4.7
    million to 6.6 million, i.e., 40%, and their wages from $2,008
    million to $3,427 million, i.e., 70%. (It should be borne in mind
    that the rise in the cost of living cancelled out this nominal
    increase in wages.)

On the strength of this we may assume that the 82% increase in
    expenditure on hired farm labour corresponds to an increase of
    approximately 48% in the number of hired labourers. Making a
    similar assumption for the three main sections we obtain the
    following picture:

  Sections
 Percentage increase from 1900 to 1910
  Total rural population  
 Number of farms  
 Number of hired labourers

 
The North

  + 3.9

    + 0.6
 +40

 
The South

  +14.8

    +18.2
 +50

 
The West

  +49.7

    +53.7
 +66

  

 
The U. S. A.

  +11.2

    +10.9
 +48

 
These figures also show that for the country as a whole the
    increase in the number of farmers is not keeping pace with the
    growth of the rural population, while the increase in the number
    of hired labourers is outstripping the growth of the rural
    population. In other words: the proportion of independent farm
    operators is decreasing, and the proportion of dependent farm
    workers is increasing.

It should be noted that the great difference between the
    increase in the number of hired labourers obtained in the first
    estimate (+27%) and in the second (+48%) is quite possible because
    in the former only the professional farm labourers were
    enumerated, and in the latter, every instance of
    employment of hired labour was taken into account. In farming,
    seasonal hired labour is highly important, and it should be the
    rule, therefore, that it is never enough to determine the number
    of hired labourers, permanent

    

and seasonal, but that an effort must also be made to
    determine, as far as possible, the total expenditure on hired
    labour.

At any rate, both estimates definitely show a growth
    of capitalism in agriculture in the U.S.A., and an
    increase in the employment of hired labour, which is
    proceeding at a faster pace than the growth of the rural
    population and of the number of farmers.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    6. Areas of the Most Intensive Agriculture 
Having examined the general data on hired labour as the most
    direct indicator of capitalism in agriculture, we can now go on to
    a more detailed analysis of the specific forms assumed by
    capitalism in this particular branch of the economy.

We have taken a look at one area with a shrinking average
    acreage of farms, namely, the South, where the process signifies a
    transition from latifundia worked by slaves to small-scale
    commercial farms. There is another area where the average acreage
    of farms is diminishing—a part of the North: New England and
    the Middle Atlantic states. Here are the figures for these
    divisions:



   Average acreage per farm (improved land)


    New England
    Middle Atlantic States



  1850  1860  1870  1880  1890  1900  1910 
 66.5  66.4  66.4  63.4  56.5  42.4  38.4

The average farm in New England is smaller than in any other
    division of the U.S.A. In two Southern divisions the average is 42
    to 43 acres, and in the third, the West South Central, where
    homesteading is still going on, it is 61.8 acres, i.e., almost as
    much as in the Middle Atlantic states. It is the reduction in the
    average size of farms in New England and the Middle Atlantic
    states, “the areas with an older culture and a higher level
    of economic development” (Mr. Himmer, p. 60), where
    homesteading is no longer taking place, that has led Mr. Himmer,
    as it has very many

    

other bourgeois economists, to draw the
    conclusion that “capitalist agriculture is
    disintegrating”, that “production is breaking up into
    smaller units”, that there are “no areas where
    colonization is no longer continuing, or where large-scale
    capitalist agriculture is not decaying and is not being replaced
    by family-labour farms”.

Mr. Himmer arrived at these conclusions, which are the very
    opposite of the truth, because he forgot a mere
    “trifle”: the intensification of agriculture! It is
    incredible, but it is a fact. This matter requires a particularly
    thorough analysis because quite a few bourgeois economists, almost
    all in fact, contrive to forget this “trifle” when
    dealing with small and large-scale production in agriculture,
    although “in theory” they are all “aware”
    of and accept the intensification of farming. This is indeed one
    of the basic sources of all the misadventures of bourgeois
    (including Narodnik and opportunist) economics on the question of
    small “family” farms. The “trifle” they
    forget is this: owing to the technical peculiarities of
    agriculture, the process of its intensification frequently leads
    to a reduction in the improved acreage on the farm, and
    at the same time expands it as an economic unit,
    increasing its output, and making it more and more of a
    capitalist enterprise.

Let us first see whether or not there is any fundamental
    difference in farming techniques, in the general character of
    farming and degree of its intensification between New England and
    the Middle Atlantic states, on the one hand, and between the rest
    of the North and the country’s other divisions, on the
    other.

The differences in the crops grown are shown in the following table:

The difference in farming conditions is fundamental. In the
    first two divisions agriculture is highly intensive; in the other
    two it is extensive. In the latter, cereals account for the bulk
    of the total crop value; in the former, they contribute not only a
    minor part, but sometimes a negligible part (7.6%), while the
    special “commercial” crops (vegetables, fruits, etc.) yield
    a greater part of the crop value than cereals. Extensive
    agriculture has given way to intensive agriculture. Grass
    cultivation has become widespread. Of the 3.8 million acres under
    hay and forage in New England, 3.3 million acres were under
    cultivated grasses. The figures for the Middle Atlantic
    states are 8.5 and 7.9 million respectively: By contrast, of the
    27.4 million acres under hay and forage in the West North Central
    states (an area of colonization and extensive agriculture), 14.5
      million, i.e., the greater part, were unimproved grass lands, etc.


Yields are considerably higher in the “intensive” states:

This table shows that in the “intensive” states
    dairy farming is on a considerably larger scale than in
    all the others. The areas with the smallest farms (in
    terms of improved acreage) have the largest dairies. This
    fact is of tremendous importance, for, as everyone knows, dairy
    farming develops most rapidly in suburban localities and in very
    highly industrialized countries (or areas). Statistics from
    Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, which are dealt with elsewhere,
    improved[1]

    also show a growing concentration of dairy cattle.


As we have seen, hay and forage in the “intensive”
    states constitute a considerably greater proportion of the total
    crop value than cereals. Accordingly, livestock farming there
    develops largely on the basis of purchased feed. Here are
    the relevant figures for 1909:

The extensive states of the North sell feed. The intensive
    states buy it. It is clear that if feed is purchased
    large-scale operations of a highly capitalistic nature
    can be conducted on a small tract of land.


Let us make a comparison between the two intensive divisions
    of the North, New England and the Middle Atlantic states, and the
    most extensive division of the North, the West North Central:





  Division

  Improved  land  (000,000  acres)

  West North Central

We find that there is more livestock per acre of improved land
    in the intensive states (447:36 = $12 per acre) than in the
    extensive states (1,552:164 = $9). More capital in the form of
    livestock is invested in a unit of land area. And the total
    per-acre turnover of the feed trade (purchases +sales) is also
    very much greater in the intensive states (26+89 = $115 million
    for 36 million acres) than in the extensive states (174+76 = $250
    million for 164 million acres). In the intensive states farming is
    obviously much more commercialized than in the extensive
    states.


Expenditure on fertilizers and the value of implements and
    machinery are the most exact statistical expression of the degree
    of intensification of agriculture. Here are the figures:

This fully brings out the difference between the extensive
    divisions of the North, with an insignificant proportion of farms
    using purchased fertilizers (2-19%), and with negligible
    expenditure on fertilizers per acre of improved land (
    $0.01-$0.09)—and the intensive states, where the
    majority of farms (57-60%) use purchased fertilizers and
    where expenditure on fertilizers is substantial. In New England,
    for example, the per-acre expenditure is $1.30—the
    maximum figure for all divisions (once again a case of

    

farms with the smallest acreage and the largest expenditure on
    fertilizers!), which exceeds the figure for one of the divisions
    of the South (South Atlantic). It should be noted that in the
    South especially large quantities of artificial fertilizers are
    required by cotton, on which, as we have seen, the labour of Negro
    share-croppers is most widely employed.

In the Pacific states, we find a very small percentage of
    farms using fertilizers (6.4%) but the maximum average per farm
    expenditure ($189)—calculated, of course, only for the farms
    which used fertilizers. Here we have another example of the growth
    of large-scale and capitalist agriculture with a
    simultaneous reduction of the farm acreage. In two of the
    three Pacific states—Washington and Oregon—the use of
    fertilizers is quite insignificant, a mere $0.01 per acre. It is
    only in the third state, California, that the figure is relatively
    high: $0.08 in 1899, and $0.19 in 1909. In this state, the fruit
    crop plays a special role, and is expanding at an extremely rapid
    rate along purely capitalist lines; in 1909, it accounted for
    33.1% of the total crop value, as against 18.3% for cereals, and
    27.6% for hay and forage. The typical fruit-growing farm has a
    smaller-than-average acreage but the use of fertilizers
    and hired labour is much greater than average. We shall
    later have occasion to dwell on relationships of this type, which
    are typical of capitalist countries with an intensive agriculture
    and which are most stubbornly ignored by statisticians and
    economists.

But let us return to the “intensive” states of the
    North. Not only is expenditure on fertilizers—$1.30 per
    acre—in New England the highest and the average farm acreage
    the smallest (38.4 acres); expenditure on fertilizers is
    increasing at an especially rapid rate. In the 10 years between
    1899 and 1909, this expenditure increased from $0.53 per acre to
    $1.30, i.e., two and one-half times. Consequently, here
    intensification of agriculture, technical progress and improvement
    of farming techniques are extremely rapid. To get a more graphic
    picture of what this means let us compare New England, the most
    intensive division of the North, with West North Central, the most
    extensive division. In the latter division, scarcely any
    artificial fertilizers are

    

used at all (2.1% of the farms and
    $0.01 per acre); its farm acreage is larger than that of any other
    division of America (148 acres), and is growing at a faster
    rate. This particular division is usually taken as the model of
    capitalism in American agriculture—and this Mr. Himmer also
    does. As I shall show in detail later on, this is incorrect. It is
    due to the crudest, most primitive form of extensive agriculture
    being confused with technically progressive intensive
    agriculture. In the West North Central division, the average farm
    is four times as big as in New England (148 acres as against
    38.4), while average expenditure on fertilizers per user is only
    half as great: $41 as against $82.

Hence, in actual practice there are instances of a substantial
    reduction in farm acreage being accompanied by a
    substantial increase in expenditure on artificial
    fertilizers, so that “small” production—if we
    continue, as a matter of routine, to regard it as being small in
    terms of acreage—turns out to be “large” in
    terms of the capital invested in the land. This is not an
    exception, but the rule for any country where extensive
    agriculture is giving way to intensive agriculture. And this
    applies to all capitalist countries, so that when this
    typical, essential and fundamental characteristic of agriculture
    is ignored, the result is the common error of the votaries of
    small-scale agriculture who base their judgement only on farm
      acreage.

7. Machinery and Hired Labour in
Agriculture

Let us consider another form of capital investment in land which
      is technically different from the form examined
      above—implements and machinery. All European agricultural
      statistics provide irrefutable evidence that the larger the farm
      acreage, the greater is the proportion of farms using all types
      of machines and the greater the number of machines used. The
      superiority of big farms in this highly important respect has
      been established beyond doubt. In this field, too, American
      statisticians have a rather unconventional approach: neither
      implements nor farm machinery are recorded separately, only
      their total value being given. Such data may, of course, be less
      exact in each individual case, but taken as a whole they allow
      definite comparisons

    

between divisions and between groups of
      farms—comparisons which are impossible with other kinds of
      data.


Below are the figures for farm implements and machinery by
      divisions:

The former slave-owning South, the area of share-cropping,
      occupies a bottom place in the use of machinery. The value of
      implements and machinery per acre—for its three
      divisions—is one-third, one-quarter, one-fifth of the
      figures for the intensive states of the North. The latter lead
      the rest and, in particular, are far ahead of the West North
      Central states, America’s most agricultural area and her
      granary, which superficial observers still frequently regard as
      a model area of capitalism and of the use of machinery.


It should be noted that the American statistical method of
      determining the value of machinery, as well as of land,
      livestock, buildings, etc., per acre of all farmland and not per
      acre of improved land, understates the superiority of the
      “intensive” areas of the North and cannot, in general, be
      considered correct. The difference between the divisions in
      regard to the proportion of improved acreage is very great: in
      the West, it is as low as 26.7% for the Mountain states, and as
      high as 75.4% for the East North Central states in the
      North. For the purposes of economic statistics, improved land is
      undoubtedly of much greater importance than total acreage. In
      New England, improved acreage in farms and its proportion of the
      total has decreased substantially, especially since 1880,
      probably

    

under the impact of competition from the free lands of
      the West (i.e., free from ground-rent, from tribute to the
      landowning gentry). At the same time, the use of machinery in
      this division is very extensive and the value of machinery per
      acre of improved land is especially high. In 1910, it
      amounted to $7 per acre, while in the Middle Atlantic States it
      was about $5.50 and not more than $2-3 in the other divisions.


Again, the division with the smallest farms, in terms
      of acreage, turns out to have the largest capital
      investments in land in the form of machinery.


Comparing the Middle Atlantic, one of the “intensive” divisions
      of the North, with the most extensive region of the North, the
      West North Central, we discover that as far as improved acreage
      per farm is concerned, that of the former is less than half
      that of the latter—62.6 acres as against
      148.0—while the value of machinery used is
      greater—$358 per farm as against $332. The smaller
      farms are thus larger enterprises in terms of-machinery used.


We still have to compare the data on the intensive nature of
      agriculture with the data on the employment of hired labour. I
      already gave these figures in brief above, in Chapter 5. We must
      now examine them in greater detail by divisions .

This shows, firstly, that capitalism is undoubtedly much more
      developed in the agriculture of the Northern intensive states
      than in that of the extensive states; secondly, that in the
      former, capitalism is developing faster than in the latter;
      thirdly, that the division with the smallest farms, New England,
      has both the highest level of development of capitalism in
      agriculture and the highest rate of its development. There the
      increase of expenditure on hired labour per acre of improved
      land is 86%; the Pacific states come second in this
      respect. California, where, as I have said, “small-scale”
      capitalist fruit-raising is rapidly developing, is also the
      leader in this respect among the Pacific states.


The West North Central division, with the largest farm acreages
      (an average of 148 acres in 1910, counting improved land only)
      and with the most rapid and steady growth of farm acreages since
      1850, is commonly regarded as the “model” capitalist region of
      American agriculture. We have now seen that this contention is
      profoundly erroneous. The extent to which hired labour is used
      is certainly the best and most direct indicator of the
      development of capitalism. And it tells us that America’s
      “granary”, the region of the much vaunted “wheat factories”,
      which attract so much attention, is less capitalist
      than the industrial and intensively farmed region, where the
      indication of agricultural progress is not an increase in
      improved acreage but an increase in capital investments
      in the land, together with a simultaneous reduction of
      the acreage.


It is quite possible to imagine that with the use of machinery
      the improvement of the “black soil” or unploughed virgin lands
      in general can proceed very rapidly despite a small increase in
      the employment of hired labour. In the West North Central states
      expenditure on hired labour per acre of improved land was $0.56
      in 1899, and $0.83 in 1909, an increase of only 48%. In New
      England, where the improved area is decreasing and not
      increasing and where the average size of farms is decreasing and
      not in creasing, expenditure on hired labour was not only very
      much higher both in 1899 ($2.55 per acre) and in 1909 ($4.76 per
      acre), but had grown during the period at a much faster rate
      (+86%).

 

The average farm in New England is one-fourth the size
      of farms in the West North Central states (38.4 as against 148
      acres), yet its average expenditure on hired labour is
      greater : $277 as against $240. Consequently, the
      reduction in the size of farms means in such cases that a
      greater amount of capital is invested in agriculture, and that
      the capitalist nature of agriculture is intensified; it
      signifies a growth of capitalism and capitalist production.


While the West North Central states, which comprise 34.3% of the
      total improved acreage in the U.S.A., are the most typical
      division of “extensive” capitalist agriculture, the
      Mountain states offer an example of similar extensive
      farming in conditions of the most rapid colonization. Here less
      hired labour is employed, in terms of the proportion of farms
      employing labour, but the average expenditure on hired labour is
      very much higher than in the West North Central division. But in
      the former the employment of hired labour increased at a slower
      rate than in any other division of America (only +22%). This
      type of evolution was apparently due to the following
      conditions. In this division, colonization and the distribution
      of homesteads are extremely widespread. The area under crops
      increased more than in any other division: by 89% from 1900 to
      1910. The settlers, the owners of the homesteads, naturally
      employ little hired labour, at any rate when starting their
      farms. On the other hand, hired labour must be employed on a
      very large scale, firstly, by some latifundia, which are
      especially numerous in this division as in the West in general;
      and secondly, by farms raising special and highly capitalist
      crops. In some states of this division, for instance, a very
      high proportion of the total crop value comes from fruits
      (Arizona—6%, Colorado—10%), and vegetables
      (Colorado—11.9%, Nevada—11.2%), and so forth.


In summing up, I must say the following: Mr. Himmer’s assertion
      that “there are no areas where colonization is no longer
      continuing, or where large-scale capitalist agriculture is not
      decaying and is not being replaced by family-labour farms”, is a
      mockery of the truth, and entirely contrary to the actual
      facts. The New England division, where there is no colonization
      at all, where farms are smallest, where

    

      farming is most intensive, shows the highest level of capitalism
      in agriculture and the highest rate of capitalist
      development. This conclusion is most essential and basic for an
      understanding of the process of capitalist development in
      agriculture in general, because the intensification of
      agriculture and the reduction in the average farm acreage that
      goes with it is not some accidental, local, casual phenomenon,
      but one that is common to all civilized
      countries. Bourgeois economists of every stripe make a host of
      mistakes when considering data on the evolution of agriculture
      (as in Great Britain, Denmark, and Germany) because they are not
      familiar enough with this general phenomenon, they have not
      given it enough thought and have not understood or analysed it.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

7. Machinery and Hired Labour in
Agriculture

Let us consider another form of capital investment in land which
      is technically different from the form examined
      above—implements and machinery. All European agricultural
      statistics provide irrefutable evidence that the larger the farm
      acreage, the greater is the proportion of farms using all types
      of machines and the greater the number of machines used. The
      superiority of big farms in this highly important respect has
      been established beyond doubt. In this field, too, American
      statisticians have a rather unconventional approach: neither
      implements nor farm machinery are recorded separately, only
      their total value being given. Such data may, of course, be less
      exact in each individual case, but taken as a whole they allow
      definite comparisons

    

between divisions and between groups of
      farms—comparisons which are impossible with other kinds of
      data.


Below are the figures for farm implements and machinery by
      divisions:

The former slave-owning South, the area of share-cropping,
      occupies a bottom place in the use of machinery. The value of
      implements and machinery per acre—for its three
      divisions—is one-third, one-quarter, one-fifth of the
      figures for the intensive states of the North. The latter lead
      the rest and, in particular, are far ahead of the West North
      Central states, America’s most agricultural area and her
      granary, which superficial observers still frequently regard as
      a model area of capitalism and of the use of machinery.


It should be noted that the American statistical method of
      determining the value of machinery, as well as of land,
      livestock, buildings, etc., per acre of all farmland and not per
      acre of improved land, understates the superiority of the
      “intensive” areas of the North and cannot, in general, be
      considered correct. The difference between the divisions in
      regard to the proportion of improved acreage is very great: in
      the West, it is as low as 26.7% for the Mountain states, and as
      high as 75.4% for the East North Central states in the
      North. For the purposes of economic statistics, improved land is
      undoubtedly of much greater importance than total acreage. In
      New England, improved acreage in farms and its proportion of the
      total has decreased substantially, especially since 1880,
      probably

    

under the impact of competition from the free lands of
      the West (i.e., free from ground-rent, from tribute to the
      landowning gentry). At the same time, the use of machinery in
      this division is very extensive and the value of machinery per
      acre of improved land is especially high. In 1910, it
      amounted to $7 per acre, while in the Middle Atlantic States it
      was about $5.50 and not more than $2-3 in the other divisions.


Again, the division with the smallest farms, in terms
      of acreage, turns out to have the largest capital
      investments in land in the form of machinery.


Comparing the Middle Atlantic, one of the “intensive” divisions
      of the North, with the most extensive region of the North, the
      West North Central, we discover that as far as improved acreage
      per farm is concerned, that of the former is less than half
      that of the latter—62.6 acres as against
      148.0—while the value of machinery used is
      greater—$358 per farm as against $332. The smaller
      farms are thus larger enterprises in terms of-machinery used.


We still have to compare the data on the intensive nature of
      agriculture with the data on the employment of hired labour. I
      already gave these figures in brief above, in Chapter 5. We must
      now examine them in greater detail by divisions .

This shows, firstly, that capitalism is undoubtedly much more
      developed in the agriculture of the Northern intensive states
      than in that of the extensive states; secondly, that in the
      former, capitalism is developing faster than in the latter;
      thirdly, that the division with the smallest farms, New England,
      has both the highest level of development of capitalism in
      agriculture and the highest rate of its development. There the
      increase of expenditure on hired labour per acre of improved
      land is 86%; the Pacific states come second in this
      respect. California, where, as I have said, “small-scale”
      capitalist fruit-raising is rapidly developing, is also the
      leader in this respect among the Pacific states.


The West North Central division, with the largest farm acreages
      (an average of 148 acres in 1910, counting improved land only)
      and with the most rapid and steady growth of farm acreages since
      1850, is commonly regarded as the “model” capitalist region of
      American agriculture. We have now seen that this contention is
      profoundly erroneous. The extent to which hired labour is used
      is certainly the best and most direct indicator of the
      development of capitalism. And it tells us that America’s
      “granary”, the region of the much vaunted “wheat factories”,
      which attract so much attention, is less capitalist
      than the industrial and intensively farmed region, where the
      indication of agricultural progress is not an increase in
      improved acreage but an increase in capital investments
      in the land, together with a simultaneous reduction of
      the acreage.


It is quite possible to imagine that with the use of machinery
      the improvement of the “black soil” or unploughed virgin lands
      in general can proceed very rapidly despite a small increase in
      the employment of hired labour. In the West North Central states
      expenditure on hired labour per acre of improved land was $0.56
      in 1899, and $0.83 in 1909, an increase of only 48%. In New
      England, where the improved area is decreasing and not
      increasing and where the average size of farms is decreasing and
      not in creasing, expenditure on hired labour was not only very
      much higher both in 1899 ($2.55 per acre) and in 1909 ($4.76 per
      acre), but had grown during the period at a much faster rate
      (+86%).

 

The average farm in New England is one-fourth the size
      of farms in the West North Central states (38.4 as against 148
      acres), yet its average expenditure on hired labour is
      greater : $277 as against $240. Consequently, the
      reduction in the size of farms means in such cases that a
      greater amount of capital is invested in agriculture, and that
      the capitalist nature of agriculture is intensified; it
      signifies a growth of capitalism and capitalist production.


While the West North Central states, which comprise 34.3% of the
      total improved acreage in the U.S.A., are the most typical
      division of “extensive” capitalist agriculture, the
      Mountain states offer an example of similar extensive
      farming in conditions of the most rapid colonization. Here less
      hired labour is employed, in terms of the proportion of farms
      employing labour, but the average expenditure on hired labour is
      very much higher than in the West North Central division. But in
      the former the employment of hired labour increased at a slower
      rate than in any other division of America (only +22%). This
      type of evolution was apparently due to the following
      conditions. In this division, colonization and the distribution
      of homesteads are extremely widespread. The area under crops
      increased more than in any other division: by 89% from 1900 to
      1910. The settlers, the owners of the homesteads, naturally
      employ little hired labour, at any rate when starting their
      farms. On the other hand, hired labour must be employed on a
      very large scale, firstly, by some latifundia, which are
      especially numerous in this division as in the West in general;
      and secondly, by farms raising special and highly capitalist
      crops. In some states of this division, for instance, a very
      high proportion of the total crop value comes from fruits
      (Arizona—6%, Colorado—10%), and vegetables
      (Colorado—11.9%, Nevada—11.2%), and so forth.


In summing up, I must say the following: Mr. Himmer’s assertion
      that “there are no areas where colonization is no longer
      continuing, or where large-scale capitalist agriculture is not
      decaying and is not being replaced by family-labour farms”, is a
      mockery of the truth, and entirely contrary to the actual
      facts. The New England division, where there is no colonization
      at all, where farms are smallest, where

    

      farming is most intensive, shows the highest level of capitalism
      in agriculture and the highest rate of capitalist
      development. This conclusion is most essential and basic for an
      understanding of the process of capitalist development in
      agriculture in general, because the intensification of
      agriculture and the reduction in the average farm acreage that
      goes with it is not some accidental, local, casual phenomenon,
      but one that is common to all civilized
      countries. Bourgeois economists of every stripe make a host of
      mistakes when considering data on the evolution of agriculture
      (as in Great Britain, Denmark, and Germany) because they are not
      familiar enough with this general phenomenon, they have not
      given it enough thought and have not understood or analysed it.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    8. Displacement of Small by Big Enterprises.
      Quantity of Improved Land

We have examined the major forms of the development of
      capitalism in agriculture, and have seen how extremely varied
      they are. The most important are: the break-up of the
      slave-holding latifundia in the South; the growth of large-scale
      extensive farming operations in the extensive area of the North;
      the most rapid development of capitalism in the intensive area
      of the North, where farms are, on the average, the smallest. The
      facts incontrovertibly prove that in some cases the development
      of capitalism is indicated by an increase in farm acreage and in
      others by an increase in the number of farms. In view of such a
      state of affairs we learn nothing from the returns on average
      farm acreages summarized for the country as a whole.


What then is the net result of the various local and
      agricultural peculiarities? An indication is given by the data
      on hired labour. The growing employment of hired labour is a
      general process transcending all these
      peculiarities. But in the vast majority of civilized countries
      agricultural statistics, paying tribute, intentionally or
      otherwise, to prevailing bourgeois notions and prejudices,
      either fail to furnish any systematic information on hired
      labour at all, or give it only for the most recent period (e.g.,
      German Agricultural Census of 1907), so that it is impossible

    

to
      make a comparison with the past. I shall show in detail
      elsewhere that in the elaboration and tabulation of the returns
      of hired labour American statistics changed markedly for the
      worse between 1900 and 1910.


The most common and most popular method of presenting
      statistical summaries in America and most other countries is to
      compare big and small farms by acreage. I shall now proceed to a
      consideration of these data.


In grouping farms by acreage, American statisticians take total
      acreage and not just the improved area, which would, of course,
      be the more correct method, and is the one employed by German
      statisticians. No reason is given why seven groups (under 20
      acres, 20 to 49, 50 to 99, 100 to 174, 175 to 499, 500 to 999,
      1,000 and over) are used to tabulate the returns of the 1910
      Census in the United States. Statistical routine must apparently
      have been of paramount consideration. I shall call the
      100-to-174-acre group—medium, because it consists mostly of
      homesteads (the official size of a homestead is 160 acres), and
      also because land holdings of this size usually give the farmer
      the greatest degree of “independence” and require the least
      employment of hired labour. The groups above that I shall call
      large or capitalistic because, as a general rule, they do not
      manage without hired labour. Farms with 1,000 acres and over I
      shall regard as latifundia—of which three-fifths is
      unimproved land in the North, nine-tenths, in the South, and
      two-thirds, in the West. Small farms are those with less than
      100 acres; how much economic independence they have is evident
      from the fact that in three groups, from the bottom up, 51%, 43%
      and 23% of the farms respectively, are recorded as having no
      horses. It goes without saying that this characteristic should
      not be taken in an absolute sense and should not he applied to
      all divisions or to localities with specific conditions without
      a special analysis.


I am unable to give here the returns for all the seven groups in
      the main sections of the United States, for this would overload
      the text with an excessive number of figures. I shall,
      therefore, merely outline the basic distinctions between the
      North, the South and the West, and give the full returns only
      for the United States as a whole. We should

    

not lose sight of
      the fact that three-fifths (60.6%) of all the improved land, is
      in the North; less than one third (31.5%), in the South; and
      under one-twelfth (7.9%), in the West.


The most striking distinction between the three main sections is
      that the capitalist North has the smallest number of
      latifundia, although their number, their total acreage, and
      their improved acreage are on the increase. In 1910, 0.5% of the
      farms in the North were of 1,000 acres and over; these big farms
      had 6.9% of all the land and 4.1% of the improved land. The
      South had 0.7% of such farms, with 23.9% of the total acreage
      and 4.8% of the improved acreage. In the West there were 3.9% of
      such farms, owning 48.3% of the total acreage, and 32.3% of the
      improved acreage. This is a familiar picture: the slave-holding
      latifundia of the South, and the even vaster latifundia of the
      West, the latter being partly the foundation of the most
      extensive stock-raising, and partly reserve tracts of land
      occupied by “settlers” and resold or (less often) leased to real
      farmers improving the “Far West”.


America demonstrates clearly that it would be imprudent to
      confuse the latifundia with large-scale capitalist agriculture,
      and that the latifundia are frequently survivals of
      pre-capitalist relationships—slave-owning, feudal or
      patriarchal. A break-up, a parcelling out of the latifundia, is
      taking place both in the South and in the West. In the North,
      the total farm acreage increased by 30.7 million acres, of which
      only 2.3 million is accounted for by latifundia, while 22
      million belongs to big, capitalist farms (175 to 999 acres). In
      the South, the total acreage was reduced by 7.5 million. The
      latifundia decreased by 31.8 million acres. On the
      small farms there was an increase of 13 million, and on the
      medium farms, 5 million acres. In the West, the total acreage
      increased by 17 million; among the latifundia there was a
      decrease of 1.2 million; on the small farms, an increase of 2
      million; medium, 5 million; large, 11 million acres.


The improved acreage increased in the latifundia of all
      three sections: substantially in the North (+3.7 million acres =
      +47.0%), very slightly in the South (+0.3

    

million = +5.5%), and
      more in the West (+2.8 million = +29.6%). But in the North, the
      maximum increase in the improved acreage-occurred on the
      large farms (175 to 999 acres); in the South, on the
      small and medium; in the West, on the
      large and medium. Hence, it is the large farms
      that are increasing their share of the improved land in
      the North, and the small and in part the medium farms, in the
      South and the West. This picture fully corresponds to what we
      already know about the different conditions in these
      sections. In the South, there is a growth ot small-scale
      commercial farming at the expense of the disintegrating
      slave-holding latifundia; the process is similar in the West,
      except that the break-up of even larger latifundia, which had
      their origin not in slave-holding but in extensive
      stock ranches and pre-empted tracts, is not as
      pronounced. Moreover, American statisticians say the following
      about the Pacific division:


      “The great development of small fruit and other farms on the
      Pacific coast, due, in part at least, to irrigation projects
      organized in recent years, is reflected in the increase in small
      farms of less than 50 acres in the Pacific division” (Vol. V,
      p. 264).


The North has neither slave-holding nor “primitive” latifundia,
      there is no disintegration of them, no growth of the small farms
      at the expense of the large.


The process for the United States as a whole appears as follows:

Thus, the number of latifundia in proportion to the total number
      of farms remains unchanged. The most characteristic change in
      the relationship between the other groups in the reduction
      in the number of medium-size farms and the

    

strengthening of
      the farms at both ends. The medium-size group (100 to 174 acres)
      and its smaller neighbor have lost ground. The smallest and the
      small farms show the greatest gains, and are followed by the
      large-scale capitalist farms (175 to 999 acres).

We find above all a very substantial reduction in the share of
      total acreage held by the latifundia. It should be borne in mind
      that an absolute reduction is taking place only in the South and
      the West, where the proportion of unimproved land in
      the latifundia in 1910 was 91.5% and 77.1% respectively. There
      was also an insignificant decrease in the share of the top small
      group in the total acreage (—0.1% in the 50-to-99-acre size
      group). The greatest increase was shown by the large-scale
      capitalist groups, the 175-to-499-acre and the 500-to-999-acre
      groups. There was a relatively small increase in the share of
      the very small groups in the acreage. The medium group (100 to
      174 acres) was practically stagnant (+0.4%).


Let us now take a look at the improved acreage.

The size of the farming enterprise is indicated with
      some degree of approximation and allowing for certain exceptions
      to which I have referred and shall refer again below—only
      by the improved and not the total acreage. Once again we find
      that while the share of the total acreage held by the latifundia
      substantially decreased, their share of the improved acreage
      increased. In general, all the capitalistic groups
      gained ground, and most of all the 500-to-999-acre group. The
      largest reduction was in the medium-size group (—1.7%),
      followed by all the small groups, with the exception of the
      smallest, the group under 20 acres, which showed a negligible
      increase (+0.1%).


Let us note in advance that the smallest-size group (under 20
      acres) includes farms of less than 3 acres, which are not
      included in American statistics unless they raise at least $250
      worth of products a year. For that reason these tiny farms (of
      less than 3 acres) have a greater volume of production and a
      more highly developed capitalist character than the next group
      up the scale. To illustrate this point here are the returns for
      1900—unfortunately the corresponding returns for 1910 are
      not available:

Even the 3-to-10-acre farms, to say nothing of farms with less
      than 3 acres, turn out in some respects to be “larger” (outlays
      on hired labour, value of implements and machinery) than the
      10-to-20-acre farms.[1]

Consequently,

    

there is good reason to
      attribute the increase in the share of the total improved land
      held by farms under 20 acres to an increase in the improved land
      of the pronounced capitalist-type farms of the smallest-size
      group.


On the whole, the returns for 1900 and l910 on the distribution
      of improved land in the U.S.A. between small and large farms
      warrant this absolutely definite and indubitable conclusion:
      the large farms are becoming stronger, the medium
      and the small farms, weaker. Hence,
      insofar as the capitalist or non-capitalist character
      of agriculture can be deduced from the data relating to farms
      grouped by acreage, the United States in the last decade shows,
      as a general rule, a growth of the large-scale, capitalist farms
      and the obliteration of small farms.


The statistics on the increase in the number of farms and the improved acreage in each group will confirm this conclusion:

The largest percentage increase in the improved acreage took
      place in the two topmost groups. The least increase occurred in
      the medium-size group and the next smaller group (50 to 99
      acres). In the two smallest groups the percentage increase in
      the improved acreage was less than the percentage increase in
      the number of farms.

    

     

Notes
 

[1]

For
      1900 we have returns by size groups for the number of high
      income farms, i.e., farms with a product valued over
      $2,500. Here are these figures: among farms of less than 3
      acres, the proportion of high-income farms was 5.2%; 3 to 10
      acres—0.6%; 10 to 20 acres—0.4%; 20 to 50
      acres—0.3%; 50 to 100—0.6%; 100 to 175—1.4%; 175
      to 260—5.2%; 260 to 500—12.7%; 500 to
      1,000—24.3%; 1,000 and

   

over—39.5%. We find the
      proportion of high-income farms in all the under-20-acre groups
      to be greater than in the 20-to-50-acre group.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    9. Continued. Statistics on the Value of Farms

American statistics, unlike European statistics, determine, for
      each farm and each group of farms, the value of the various
      elements making up the farming enterprise—the land,
      buildings, implements, livestock and the enterprise as a
      whole. These data are probably not quite as accurate as the data
      relating to acreage, but generally speaking they are equally
      reliable, and in addition give some idea of the general state of
      capitalism in agriculture.


In order to supplement the above analysis I shall now take the
      data relating to the total value of farms with all their
      agricultural property, and also the data on the value of
      implements and machinery. I single out implements and machinery
      from among the various elements of the enterprise because they
      are a direct indication of the agricultural operations being
      conducted, and of how they are being conducted i.e., whether
      more or less intensively, and whether they employ technical
      improvements to a greater or lesser extent. Here are the figures
      for the U.S.A.:

The absolute figures show that from 1900 to 1910 the value of
      all farm property more than doubled; it increased from $20,440
      million to $40,991 million, i.e., 100.5%. The rise in the prices
      of farm products and rents put millions and thousands of
      millions of dollars into the pockets of the landowners at the
      expense of the working class. What were the comparative gains of
      the small and the big farms? The above figures supply the
      answer. They show that the latifundia declined (their total
      acreage fell from 23.6%

    

to 19.0%, or 4.6%), and that the
      small and medium-size farms are being displaced by the
      large, capitalist farms (175 to 999 acres). Adding up the
      figures for the small and medium farms we find that their share
      in the total property decreased from 56.4 to
      52.7%. Adding up the figures for the large farms and the
      latifundia we find that their share increased from
      43.7% to 47.3%. There were absolutely identical changes in the
      distribution of the total value of implements and machinery
      between the small and large farms.


We also observe the phenomenon noted above in the figures
      relating to the latifundia. Their decline is limited to two
      sections: the South and the West. It is a decline, on the one
      hand, of the slave-holding latifundia, and on the other, of the
      primitive-squatter and the primitive-extensive latifundia. We
      find a growth of latifundia in the populated industrial
      North: this applies to the number of farms of this type, their
      total acreage, their improved acreage, their share in the total
      value of all farm property (2.5% in 1900; 2.8% in 1910), and
      their share in the total value of all implements and machinery.


There is moreover a growth of the role of the latifundia not
      only throughout the North in general but also in both
      the intensive divisions of the North in particular, where there
      is absolutely no colonization, namely New England and the Middle
      Atlantic states. These divisions must be analyzed in greater
      detail because, for one thing, they have misled Mr. Himmer and
      many others by the particularly small average size of their
      farms and a reduction of that size, and, for another, these most
      intensive divisions are most typical of the older, long settled,
      civilized countries of Europe.


Between 1900 and 1910, the number of farms, the total acreage
      and the improved acreage decreased in both these divisions. In
      New England, there was an increase only in the number of the
      smallest farms, those under 20 acres, by 22.4% (the
      improved land on them increased by 15.5%), and in the number of
      latifundia—by 16.3%, and their improved acreage by
      26.8%. In the Middle Atlantic states there was an increase in
      the smallest farms (+7.7% in the number, and +2.5% in
      the improved acreage) and also in the number of the 175-to-499-acre

    

farms (+1.0%) and the improved land on the 500-to-999-acre
      farms (+3.8%). In both divisions, there was an increase
      in the share of the smallest farms and the share of the
      latifundia in the total value of all farm property and also of
      implements and machinery. Here are some figures which give a
      clearer and fuller picture of each of these divisions:

This makes it clear that in both divisions it was the
      latifundia that gained most ground, showed the greatest
      economic gains, and made the greatest technical advance. Here
      the largest capitalist enterprises are displacing the
      others, the smaller farms. A minimum increase in the value of
      all property and also of implements and machinery is evident in
      the medium-size group and in the small group, but not in the
      smallest. Hence, it is the medium and small farms that mostly
      lag behind.


As for the smallest farms (under 20 acres), their advance in
      both divisions is above the average, and second only to
      the latifundia. We already know the reason: 31 to 33% of the
      crop value in both these intensive divisions comes from the
      highly capitalist crops (vegetables, and also fruits, flowers,
      etc.) which yield extremely great values on very small
      acreage’s. In these divisions, cereal crops account for only 8
      to 30% of the crop value; and hay and forage, 31 to 42%; there
      is a growth of dairy farming which is characterized by
      smaller-than-average acreages, but a
      greater-than-average value of produce and capital outlays on
      hired
      labour.

 

In the most intensive divisions, there is a decrease in the
      average improved acreage in farms because the average is
      obtained by combining the acreage of the latifundia and that of
      the smallest farms, the number of which is increasing more
      rapidly than that of the medium-size farms. The smallest farms
      are increasing in number faster than the latifundia. But there
      is a dual growth of capitalism: it increases-the size of farms
      worked by old technical methods; and creates new enterprises
      raising special commercial crops on very small and tiny
      acreages, with an extremely great volume of production and
      employment of hired labour.


The net result is the greatest gains by the latifundia and the
      giant farms, the obliteration of the medium and small farms, and
      the growth of the smallest highly capitalist enterprises.


We shall presently see how the net result of such
      contradictory—seemingly contradictory—phenomena of
      capitalism in agriculture can be expressed in statistical
      terms.

    10. Defects of Conventional Methods of Economic Analysis.
      Marx on the Peculiarities Of Agriculture

The grouping of farms by acreage, total or improved, is the only
      kind of grouping which was used in the American Census reports
      for 1910, and which is used in the great majority of European
      countries. Generally speaking, it is indisputable that apart
      from fiscal, bureaucratic and administrative reasons there are
      scientific considerations arguing the need and correctness of
      this kind of grouping. Still it is obviously inadequate for it
      completely fails to take account of the intensification of
      agriculture, the increasing expenditure of capital per unit of
      area in the form of livestock, machinery, improved seeds, better
      methods of crop cultivation, etc. Meanwhile, with the exception
      of a very few areas and countries with a primitive or purely
      extensive agriculture, it is this very process that is most
      typical for capitalist countries everywhere. For this reason the
      grouping of farms by acreage in the vast majority of cases gives
      an oversimplified and entirely inadequate picture of
      agricultural development in general, and of capitalist
      development in agriculture in particular.

 

When the verbose economists and statisticians who express the
      most popular bourgeois views hold forth on the dissimilarity of
      conditions in agriculture and industry, the specific nature of
      the former, and so on and so forth, one is always tempted to
      say: Gentlemen! You yourselves are most to blame for maintaining
      and spreading oversimplified and crude notions of evolution in
      agriculture! Remember Marx’s Capital. In it you will
      find references to the extreme variety of forms of land
      ownership, such as feudal, clan, communal (and
      primitive-squatter), state, etc., which capitalism encounters
      when it makes its appearance on the historical scene. Capital
      subordinates to itself all these varied forms of land ownership
      and remolds them after its own fashion, and if one is to
      understand, evaluate and express this process in statistical
      terms, one must learn to modify the formulation of the question
      and the methods of investigation in accordance with the changing
      form of the process. Capitalism subordinates to itself
      all these forms of land ownership: communal-allotment holdings
      in Russia; squatter tracts or holdings regulated by free
      distribution in a democratic or a feudal state, as in Siberia or
      the American Far West; the slave-holding estates in the American
      South, and the semi-feudal landholdings of the “purely Russian”
      gubernias. In all these cases, the development and victory of
      capitalism is similar, though not identical in form. In order to
      study and understand the precise nature of the process one must
      go beyond the trite petty-bourgeois phrases about “family
      farming” or the routine methods of comparing acreage alone.


You will also find that Marx analyses the origin of the
      capitalist type of ground-rent and its relationship to its
      forerunners in history, such as rent in kind, labour service
      (corvée and its survivals); money-rent (quit-rent,
      etc.). But who among the bourgeois or petty-bourgeois, Narodnik,
      economists or statisticians has given any serious thought to
      applying these theoretical guiding principles of Marx’s to an
      investigation of the rise of capitalism from the
      slave-holding economy of the American South, or from
      the corvée economy in central Russia?


Finally, you will find throughout Marx’s analysis of ground-rent
      systematic references to the varied conditions of

    

agriculture
      engendered not only by the differences in quality and location
      of the land, but also by the differences in the amount of
      capital invested in it. Now what does application of
      capital to land imply? It implies technical changes in
      agriculture, its intensification, the transition to higher
      systems of field cropping, increased use of artificial
      fertilizers, the wider use and improvement of implements and
      machinery, greater employment of hired labour, etc. A record of
      the acreage alone will not express all these complex and varied
      processes, which all combine to make up the general process of
      the development of capitalism in agriculture.


Russian
Zemstvo
      statisticians,[3] especially those of the “good old”
      pre-Revolutionary days, won universal respect because they
      avoided the routine approach and took a certain scientific
      interest in their business, going beyond its purely fiscal,
      bureaucratic and administrative aspects. They were probably the
      first statisticians to notice the inadequacy of grouping farms
      by acreage alone, and, accordingly, introduced other methods of
      classification, such as by sown area, number of draught animals,
      employment of hired labour, etc. Unfortunately, the sporadic and
      scattered operations of our Zemstvo statistics—in the past
      ever what you might call an oasis in the desert of feudal
      obscurity, bureaucratic routine, and every kind of stupid
      red-tapism—have not yielded any long-term results either
      for Russian or European economics.


It should be noted that the grouping of the returns canvassed in
      modern agricultural censuses is not such a purely technical or
      highly specialized question as may appear at first sight. The
      returns contain an immense wealth of complete information on
      each enterprise as a unit, but due to the clumsy, thoughtless,
      routine approach to tabulation and grouping, this extremely
      valuable material is all lost, wasted, and discolored, which
      often makes it practically useless for any study of the laws of
      agricultural evolution. The returns make it possible to say
      quite categorically whether a farm is a capitalist enterprise,
      and to what extent; whether its farming operations are
      intensive, and to what degree, etc.; but when data relating to
      millions of farms are tabulated the most essential distinctions,
      features and characteristics—which ought to be most
      effectively
    

brought out, determined and taken
      into account—tend to disappear, so that all the economist
      gets, instead of a sensible statistical review, is routine,
      meaningless columns of figures, a kind of statistical “game of
      digits”.


The American Census of 1910 with which we are now concerned is
      an excellent example of how first-class material of surpassing
      wealth and completeness has been devalued and spoiled by the
      routine approach and scientific ignorance of the
      statisticians. The processing is very much worse than in the
      1900 Census, and even the traditional grouping of farms by
      acreage has not been fully carried out, so that we have no
      possibility of making a comparison between the enterprises in
      the various groups, say, as regards their employment of hired
      labour, the difference in their systems of field cropping, the
      use of fertilizers, etc.


I am compelled, therefore, to turn to the 1900 Census. It gave,
      to my knowledge, the world’s only example of the use of
      three different methods, instead of one, to group or
      “classify” (as the Americans say) the great abundance of
      material on more than five and a half million farms, collected
      in a single country, at a single time, and under a single
      program.


It is true that here, too, no classification gives all the
      essential characteristics of the type and size of farm. Still
      the resultant picture of capitalist agriculture and the
      capitalist evolution of agriculture is, as I hope to show, very
      much fuller, and reflects the real situation much more correctly
      than can ever be the case when the conventional, one-sided and
      inadequate single method of classification is used. Given the
      opportunity for a fuller study of facts and trends, which may be
      safely considered common to all the capitalist countries of the
      world, the most serious errors and dogmas of bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois, Narodnik political economy are shown up and
      exposed.


Since the data in question are so important I shall have to
      examine them in greater detail and employ statistical tables
      more frequently than hitherto. Realizing fully that statistical
      tables burden the text and make reading more difficult, I have
      tried to keep them down to a minimum, and hope the reader will
      be lenient with me if I now have to increase that minimum, for
      on the analysis of the points

    

examined here depends not only the
      general conclusion on the principal question—the trend,
      type, character and law of evolution of modern
      agriculture—but also the general assessment of the data
      furnished by modern agricultural statistics which are so often
      cited and just as often distorted.

It is safe to say that the statistics of any capitalist
      country—the inessential particulars apart—would
      present an absolutely similar picture. This is confirmed by the
      latest censuses in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and
      Denmark. As total farm acreage increases from group to group,
      there is also an increase in the average improved acreage, the
      average value of the produce, the value of implements and
      machinery, the value of livestock (I have omitted these figures)
      and the expenditure on hired labour (earlier on I pointed out
      the significance of the slight exception of the under-3-acre
      farms and in part of the 3-to-10-acre farms).


It would seem that it could not be otherwise. The increase in
      expenditure on hired labour appears to confirm beyond any doubt
      that the division of farms into large and small on

    

the strength
      of acreage is entirely in accord with their division into
      capitalist and non-capitalist enterprises. Nine-tenths of the
      usual arguments about “small-scale” agriculture are based on
      identification in this way and on such data.


Let us now consider the average per acre of (all) land, instead of per farm:

Allowing for some absolutely negligible exceptions we find a
      uniform decline in the characteristics of intensive farming from
      the lower groups to the higher.


The conclusion appears to be incontrovertible that “small-scale”
      production in agriculture is more intensive than large-scale
      production, that the smaller the “scale” of production, the
      greater the intensity and productivity of agriculture, and that,
      “consequently”, capitalist production in agriculture is
      maintained only by the extensive, primitive nature of the
      economy, etc.


In fact, the same conclusions are being drawn all the time, on
      every hand, in all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois
      (opportunist-“Marxist” and Narodnik) writings, for when farms
      are grouped by acreage (which is not only the most common but
      practically the only kind of grouping done) the picture will be
      similar for any capitalist country, that is, it will show the
      same decline in the characteristics of intensive agriculture
      from the lower groups to the higher. There is, for instance, the
      celebrated work of the celebrated Eduard
      David—Socialism and Agriculture—a collection
      of bourgeois prejudices and bourgeois lies under the cover

    

of
      quasi-socialist catchwords. It uses just that kind of data to
      prove the “superiority”, “viability”, etc., of “small-scale”
      production.


One factor has especially facilitated such conclusions. It is
      that data similar to the above are ordinarily available on the
      quantity of livestock; but practically nowhere are data
      collected on hired labour—especially in such a summarized
      form as expenditure on hired labour. But it is precisely the
      data on hired labour that reveal the incorrectness of all such
      conclusions. In effect, if the increase, say, in the value of
      livestock (or the total number of animals, which is the same
      thing) per unit of area down the scale is taken as evidence of
      the “superiority” of “small-scale” agriculture, it should be
      borne in mind that as we go down the scale this “superiority”
      turns out to be connected with increasing
      expenditure on hired labour! But such an increase in the
      expenditure on hired labour—notice that we have all along
      been dealing with values per unit of area, per acre, per
      hectare, per dessiatine—signifies a growth of the
      capitalist nature of the enterprise! But the capitalist
      nature of the enterprise clashes with the popular notion of
      “small-scale” production because small-scale production implies
      enterprise which is not based on hired labour.


This seems to create a knot of contradictions. The overall
      acreage returns for the size groups indicate that the “small”
      farms are non-capitalist, whereas the big farms are. Yet the
      very same data show that the “smaller” the enterprise, the more
      intensive it is, and the larger its expenditure on hired labour
      per unit of land area!


In order to explain this let us consider another type of
      grouping.

      Lenin
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    11. A More Exact Comparison of Small and Large Enterprises

As I have already said, American statisticians in this case take
      the value of the products raised on the farm, less those used as
      feed. Taken alone, these data, which appear to be available only
      in American statistics, are, of course, less exact than the
      figures for acreage or livestock, and the like. But considered
      as a whole, in relation to several million

    

farms, and especially
      for the purpose of determining the relative standing of
      the various groups of farms in the country, these data
      undoubtedly cannot be regarded as less suitable than the
      rest. At any rate, these data are a much more direct indication
      than any others of the scale of production, especially
      commercial operations, i.e., the value of the produce raised for
      the market. It should be borne in mind that any discussion of
      agricultural evolution and its laws centers on a consideration
      of small-scale and large-scale production.


What is more, in such cases the point is always the evolution of
      agriculture under capitalism, in connection with capitalism,
      under its impact, or the like. To evaluate this impact the
      greatest efforts must above all be made to draw a line of
      distinction between “natural” and commercial economy in
      agriculture. It is well known that “natural” economy, i.e.,
      production for consumption on the home farm and not for the
      market, has a relatively important part to play in agriculture,
      and is giving way to commercial farming at an extremely slow
      pace. If the accepted principles of political economy are not to
      be applied mechanically but intelligently, the law of the
      displacement of small-scale by large-scale production, for
      instance, can be applied only to commercial
      agriculture. It is hardly likely that anyone will object to this
      proposition from the theoretical standpoint. However, it is the
      rare economist or statistician who will make a special effort to
      bring out, trace and as far as possible take into account, the
      characteristics indicative of the transformation of natural into
      commercial agriculture A great step towards meeting this most
      important theoretical requirement is made by the classification
      of farms according to the money value of produce not used for
      feed.


Let us note that, when considering the undeniable fact that
      small-scale production is being displaced by large-scale
      production in industry, enterprises are always grouped according
      to the value of their product or the number of wage-workers
      employed. In industry, due to its technical peculiarities, the
      matter is much simpler. In. agriculture, because relationships
      are so much more complicated and intertwined, it is a great deal
      harder to determine the scale of operations, the value of the
      product and the extent to

    

which hired labour is employed. For
      the last-named item, it is necessary to take account of the
      total annual employment of hired labour and not merely the
      amount on hand when a census is taken, for agricultural
      operations are of an especially “seasonal” nature; in addition,
      it is necessary to list not only the permanent hired labourers
      but also the day-labourers who play a most important part in
      farming. To say that this is difficult is not to say that it is
      impossible. Rational methods of investigation adapted to the
      technical peculiarities of agriculture, including classification
      by output, the money value of the product, and the frequency and
      amount of hired labour employed, will have to be used on a much
      wider scale, in spite of the thick maze of bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois prejudices and the efforts to embellish
      bourgeois realities. And it may be safely said that any step
      forward in the use of rational methods of investigation serve to
      confirm the truth that in capitalist society small scale
      production is being displaced by large-scale production both in
      industry and agriculture.


Let us take the 1900 returns for the groups of farms in America
      classified according to the value of their product:

The farms reporting no income, i.e., with a $0 value of product,
      probably consist primarily of newly occupied homesteads on which
      their owners had not yet had time to erect buildings, acquire
      livestock or sow and raise a crop. In a country like America,
      where colonization is still in progress on such a vast scale,
      special importance attaches

    

to the question of how long a farmer
      has been in possession of his farm.


Leaving aside the zero-income farms, we get a picture quite
      similar to the one obtained above by grouping the same data
      according to total farm acreage. As the value of the product
      raised on a farm increases, there is also an increase in the
      average improved acreage, the average expenditure on hired
      labour, and the average value of implements and machinery. By
      and large, the more profitable farms—in terms of gross
      income, i.e., the value of their total product—turn out to
      have the larger acreage. It would appear that the new method of
      grouping has not yielded anything new-at all.


But now let us take the averages (the value of livestock and
      implements, expenditure on hired labour and fertilizers) per
      acre instead of per farm:

The exceptions in some respects are the zero-income farms, which
      in general are in a very special position, and the farms with
      the highest incomes, which turn out to be less intensive than
      the next group, judging by three out of the four characteristics
      we have chosen. But on the whole we find a uniform
      increase in the intensity of agriculture with the
      increase in the value of the farm product.


This result is the very opposite of the one obtained when farms
      were grouped by acreage.


The same figures yield diametrically different conclusions,
      depending on the method of grouping.


As the enterprise grows in size the intensity of agriculture
      declines—if the criterion is acreage, and
      increases—if the criterion is the value of the
      product.

 

Which of these two conclusions is the correct one?


It is clear that if the land is not being improved, acreage
      gives no idea at all of the scale of agricultural
      operations (we must not forget that in America farms are grouped
      not only according to the improved acreage, but also by the
      total acreage and that in that country the proportion of the
      improved acreage ranges from 19 to 91% in the farm groups, and
      from 27 to 75%, in the geographical divisions); it gives no
      correct idea at all if besides this there are so many
      substantial differences between farms in the methods of
      cultivation, the intensity of agriculture, the methods of field
      cropping, quantities of fertilizers, the use of machinery, the
      character of livestock farming, etc.


This is known to apply to all capitalist countries and
      even to all those whose agriculture is affected by capitalism.


We see here one of the most profound and general reasons why
      mistaken notions about the “superiority” of small-scale
      agriculture are so tenacious, and why bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois prejudices of this type prove to be compatible
      with the great progress made in the last few decades by social
      statistics in general, and agricultural statistics in
      particular. To be sure, the tenacity of these mistakes and
      prejudices is also a matter of the interests of the
      bourgeoisie, who seek to cover up the depth of class
      contradictions in contemporary bourgeois society; and everyone
      knows that when it comes to interests, the most incontrovertible
      truths are liable to be questioned.


But we are here concerned only with an examination of the
      theoretical sources of the erroneous notion of the “superiority”
      of small-scale agriculture. There is no doubt at all that of all
      these sources the most important one is the uncritical, routine
      attitude to the hackneyed methods of comparing enterprises only
      by their total acreage or the improved acreage.


The U.S.A. is an exception among capitalist countries in that it
      alone has a great deal of unoccupied, unsettled land, which is
      given away free. Agriculture still can and indeed does develop
      here through the occupation of vacant land, through the
      cultivation of virgin lands never before put to the
      plough—here it does develop in the form of the

    

most
      primitive and extensive livestock and crop raising. There is
      nothing of the kind in the old, civilized countries of
      capitalist Europe. In these countries, agriculture develops
      mainly through intensive methods, not by increases in
      the quantity of land under cultivation, but by
      improvement in the quality of cultivation, by increases
      in the amount of capital invested in the original acreage. Those
      who compare farms by acreage alone lose sight of this principal
      trend in capitalist agriculture, a trend which is gradually
      becoming the principal one in the United States as well.


The principal trend in capitalist agriculture is the conversion
      of small-scale enterprise, which remains small
      in terms of acreage, into large-scale enterprise in
      terms of output, in the development of livestock raising, the
      quantity of fertilizers, the scale on which machinery is used,
      and the like.


That is why the conclusion drawn from the comparison of the
      various groups of enterprises by acreage—that the intensity
      of agriculture declines with the greater size of
      enterprise—is entirely incorrect. The only correct
      conclusion, on the contrary, is to be drawn from the comparison
      of the various farms by the value of their product—the
      bigger the enterprise, the greater is the intensity of
      agriculture.


For acreage is only circumstantial evidence of the scale of
      agricultural operations, and the broader and more rapid the
      intensification of agriculture, the less authentic is this
      “evidence”. The value of the product of an enterprise is not
      circumstantial but direct evidence of the scale of its
      operations. Moreover, it is true in every case. By small-scale
      agriculture is always meant the kind that is not based
      on hired labour. But the transition to the exploitation of hired
      labour does not depend only on the extension of the acreage of
      an enterprise on its old technical basis—this occurs only
      in primitive, extensive enterprises—but also on an
      improvement of equipment and techniques and their modernization,
      investment in the same acreage of additional capital in the form
      of, say, new machinery or artificial fertilizers, or of
      increased and improved livestock, etc.


The classification of farms by the value of their product brings
      together enterprises which really have the same scale of
      production, regardless of acreage. Accordingly, a highly

    

intensive enterprise on a small tract of land falls into the
      same group as a relatively extensive enterprise on a large
      tract; both are actually large-scale in terms of production and
      the employment of hired labour.


On the contrary, the classification by acreage throws together
      large and small enterprises, because they happen to have a
      similar acreage; it puts into the same group enterprises with an
      entirely different scale of operations, those in which family
      labour predominates, and those in which hired labour
      predominates. The result is a picture of blunted class
      contradictions within capitalism, a picture which is
      basically incorrect and entirely misleading as to the actual
      state of affairs, but one the bourgeoisie is very fond of. This
      leads to an equally fallacious embellishment of the
      condition of the small farmers, which the bourgeoisie is
      just as fond of. The net result is a vindication of capitalism.


In effect, the fundamental and principal trend of capitalism is
      the displacement of small-scale by large-scale production, both
      in industry and in agriculture. But this displacement should not
      be interpreted merely as immediate
      expropriation. Displacement also implies the ruin of the small
      farmers and a worsening of conditions on their farms, a process
      that may go on for years and decades. This deterioration assumes
      a variety of forms, such as the small farmer’s overwork or
      malnutrition, his heavy debts, worse feed and poorer care of
      livestock in general, poorer husbandry—cultivation,
      fertilization and the like—as well as technical stagnation
      on the farm, etc. If the researcher is to be absolved from the
      charge of wittingly or otherwise playing up to the bourgeoisie
      by giving a false impression of the condition of the small
      farmer, who is being ruined and oppressed, his task is, first
      and foremost, to give a precise definition of the symptoms of
      this ruination, which are not at all simple or uniform; his next
      task is to determine these symptoms, to analyze and, as far as
      possible, to define the extent to which they have spread and how
      they change with time. But present-day economists and
      statisticians hardly pay any attention to this vital aspect of
      the matter.


Just imagine that to a group of 90 small farmers who have no
      capital to improve their farms, who lag behind the times and are
      gradually being ruined the statistician adds 10 farmers

    

who have
      all the capital they need and on equally small tracts of land
      start large-scale operations based on hired labour. The net
      result would be an embellished picture of the condition of all
      the hundred small farmers.


The U.S. Census of 1910 produced just that kind of embellished
      picture—and one that, objectively, favored the
      bourgeoisie—primarily because it discarded the method used
      in 1900 of comparing the acreage grouping and the
      value-of-product grouping. We learn, for instance, only that
      expenditure on fertilizers increased immensely, namely, by 115%,
      i.e., more than double the previous figure, while the
      expenditure on hired labour went up by only 82%, and the total
      crop value by 83%. This is tremendous progress. It is the
      progress of national agriculture as a whole. And, I dare say,
      some economist is likely to draw—if indeed has not yet
      drawn—the conclusion that this is the progress of
      small-scale family farming, for, generally speaking, the returns
      for the size groups by acreage indicate that “small-scale”
      agriculture has a much higher per-acre expenditure on
      fertilizers.


But we now know that such a conclusion would be fallacious,
      because the one thing the grouping of farms by acreage does is
      to lump together farmers on the way to ruin, or at any rate the
      indigent small farmers who cannot afford to buy fertilizers, and
      capitalists (even if they are small-time capitalists)
      who, on small tracts of land, start large-scale farming
      operations with the use of up-to-date, intensive methods and the
      employment of hired labour.


If small-scale agriculture is being generally displaced by
      large-scale agriculture, as the figures for the total value of
      farm property in 1900 and 1910 show; if, as we shall presently
      see, the raising of highly capitalist crops on small tracts
      developed at an especially fast rate in this period; if,
      according to the general statistics on small and large
      enterprises grouped by the value of their product, expenditures
      for fertilizers increased proportionately with the scale of the
      enterprise—then the conclusion inevitably follows that the
      “progress” in the use of fertilizers from 1900 to 1910 went to
      increase the preponderance of capitalist agriculture over small
      agriculture, which was displaced and suppressed to an even
      greater extent.

12. Different Types of Enterprises
in Agriculture

What I have said above about the intensive, large-scale
      capitalist enterprises on small tracts raises this question: is
      there any reason to believe that the intensification of
      agriculture leads to a reduction of farm acreage? In other
      words, are there any conditions relating to modern farming
      techniques as such that require smaller farm acreage for greater
      intensity of farming?


No answer is provided either by general theoretical reasoning or
      by examples. In each case it is a matter of the concrete
      technical level of agriculture under a given set of conditions,
      and the actual amount of capital required by a given system of
      farming. In theory, any amount of capital can be invested in any
      acreage in any possible way, but it is obvious that “this
      depends” on the existing economic, technical, and cultural
      conditions, etc., and the whole point is the kind of conditions
      prevalent in a given country at a given time. Examples serve no
      purpose at all, because in the sphere of such complex, varied,
      interwoven and contradictory trends in the economics of modern
      agriculture, any number of examples will be found to support
      opposite views. What this calls for above all—and more so
      than in any other sphere—is a picture of the process as
      a whole, with all the trends taken into account and summed
      up in the form of a resultant.


The third method of grouping used by American statisticians in
      1900 helps to find an answer to this question. It is
      classification according to the principal source of
      income. Accordingly, farms fall into one of the following
      groups: (1) hay and grain as the principal source of income; (2)
      miscellaneous; (3) livestock; (4) cotton; (5) vegetable; (6)
      fruit; (7) dairy produce; (8) tobacco; (9) rice; (10) sugar;
      (11) flowers and plants; (12) nursery products; (13) taro; and
      (14) coffee. The last seven groups (8-14) together make up only
      2.2% of the total number of farms, i.e., such an insignificant
      share, that I shall not consider them separately. These groups
      (8-14) are similar to the preceding three groups (5-7) in
      economic characteristics and significance and constitute a
      single type.

It is clear that the first two groups of enterprises (hay and
      grain, and miscellaneous) may be classified as average both as
      regards the degree of their capitalist development (their
      expenditures for hired labour are nearest the average—0.35
      to 0.47, as against an average of 0.43 for the U.S.A.) and the
      intensiveness of agriculture. All the characteristics of
      intensive operations—expenditures for fertilizers, the
      per-acre value of machinery and livestock—are nearest to
      the general average for the U S.A.


There is no doubt that these two groups are especially typical
      of the majority of agricultural enterprises in general. Hay and
      grain, followed by a combination of various farm products
      (“miscellaneous” sources of income), are the chief types of
      agricultural enterprises in all countries. It would be extremely
      interesting to have more detailed data about these groups, such,
      for instance, as a breakdown into more and less commercialized
      enterprises, etc. But, as we have seen, the American Census,
      having made one step in that direction, did not go forward, but
      went back.


The next two groups, livestock and cotton, are an example of
      farms with the least capitalistic development (the expenditures
      for hired labour: 0.29 to 0.30 as against the average of 0.43),
      and the least intensive methods of agriculture. Their values of
      implements and machinery are the lowest and considerably lower
      than the average (0.66 and 0.53 as against 0.90). Farms whose
      principal source of income is livestock naturally have more
      livestock per acre than the average for the U.S.A. (4.45 as
      against 3.66), but appear to be engaged in extensive livestock
      raising: their expenditures for fertilizers are the minimum,
      they have the largest average acreage (226.9 acres) and the
      smallest proportion of improved acreage (86.1 out of 226.9). The
      cotton farms have a higher than-average figure for fertilizers,
      but other indexes indicative of intensive agriculture (the
      per-acre value of livestock and machinery) are very low.


Finally, the last three groups—vegetables, fruit, and dairy
      produce—include farms which are, first, the smallest in
      acreage (33 to 63 acres of improved land, as against 42 to 86
      and 46 to 111 in the other groups); secondly, the most
      capitalist: they have the heaviest expenditure of hired labour,

    

from 2 to 6 times the average; and thirdly, the most
      intensive. Almost all the indexes of intensive agriculture are
      above the average: the expenditure on fertilizers, the value of
      machinery, the value of livestock (a minor exception are the
      fruit-growing farms which lag behind the average, but are well
      ahead of the farms which derive their income chiefly from hay
      and grain).


Let us now see what is the share of these highly capitalist
      farms in the country’s economy. But we must first examine their
      intensive character in somewhat greater detail.


Take the farms whose main income is derived from vegetables. It
      is well known that in all capitalist countries the development
      of towns, factories, industrial settlements, railway stations,
      ports, etc., stimulates a demand for this type of product, it
      pushes up their prices, and increases the number of agricultural
      enterprises raising them for the market. The average “vegetable”
      farm has less than one-third of the improved acreage of
      an “ordinary” farm deriving income chiefly from hay and grain:
      the former is 33.8 acres, and the latter, 111.1. This means that
      this particular technical level with this particular
      accumulation of capital in agriculture requires “vegetable”
      farms of smaller acreage; in other words, if capital invested in
      agriculture is to yield a not less-than average profit, a
      vegetable-raising farm should have, technology being what it is,
      a smaller acreage than a hay-and grain farm.


But that is not all. The growth of capitalism in agriculture
      consists above all in a transition from natural agriculture to
      commercial agriculture. This is being constantly forgotten, and
      must be brought up again and again. Commercial agriculture, it
      should be noted, does not develop along the “simple” lines
      imagined or projected by bourgeois economists, namely, through
      an ever greater output of the same products. Not at
      all. Commercial agriculture very frequently develops by shifting
      from one type of product to another, and the shift from hay and
      grain to vegetables is very common. But what bearing does it
      have on the question before us, that of farm acreage and the
      growth of capitalism in agriculture?

 

Such a shift signifies the split-up of a “large”
      111.1-acre farm into more than three “small” 33.8-acre
      farms. The old farm produced a value of $760—the average
      value of its products, less the feed raised on the farm, whose
      chief source of income is hay and grain. Each of the new farms
      produces a value of $665, or a total of $665 x 3 = $1,995, i.e.,
      more than double the original figure.


As large-scale production displaces small-scale production, farm
      acreage is reduced.


The average expenditure on hired labour on the old farm was $76;
      on the new farm it is $106, or almost half as much again, while
      acreage is one-third or even less. Expenditure on fertilizers
      has gone up from $0.04 per acre to $0.59, an increase of almost
      15 times; the value of implements and machinery has doubled from
      $1.04 to $2.12, etc.


There will, of course, be the usual objection that the number of
      such highly capitalist farms with specialized “commercial” crops
      is negligible, as compared with the total. The answer is that,
      first, the number and the role, the economic role of
      such farms, are much greater than is generally realized; and
      secondly—and this is the most important point—it
      is such crops that are developed more rapidly than
      others in the capitalist countries. That is just why a reduction
      in farm acreage with the intensification of agriculture so often
      implies an increase and not a reduction in the scale of
      operations, an increase and not a decrease in the exploitation
      of hired labour.


Here are the exact American statistics for the country as a
      whole. Let us take all the special, or “commercial”, crops
      listed above under heads 5-14, namely, vegetables, fruit, dairy
      produce, tobacco, rice, sugar, flowers, nursery products, taro,
      and coffee. In 1900, these products were the principal
      source of income for 12.5% of all farms in the U.S.A. This is
      one-eighth, a very small minority. Their acreage was 8.6%, or
      one-twelfth, of the total. But to continue. Let us take the
      total value of the products of American agriculture (less
      feed). Of this value the farms in question accounted for as much
      as 16%, i.e., their share of the value was almost double their
      share of the acreage.

 

This means that the productivity of labour and land on these
      farms was almost double the average.


Let us take the sum total of expenditure on hired labour in
      American agriculture. Of this total, 26.6%, i.e., over
      one-quarter, fell to the farms in question. This is more than
      three times their share of the acreage, and more than three
      times the average. This means that these farms are very much
      more capitalist than the average.


Their share of the total value of implements and machinery is
      20.1%, and of the expenditures for fertilizers, 31.7%, i.e.,
      slightly less than one-third of the total, and nearly
      four times the average.


Consequently, an incontrovertible fact is established for the
      country as a whole. It is that the especially intensive farms
      have an especially small acreage, especially great employment of
      hired labour, and especially high productivity of labour; that
      the economic role of these farms in the nation’s agriculture is
      two, three and more times greater than their proportion of the
      total number of farms, to say nothing of their share of the
      total acreage.


As time goes on, does the role of these highly capitalist and
      highly intensive crops and farms increase or decrease in
      comparison with other crops and farms?


The answer is provided by a comparison of the last two census
      reports: their role is unquestionably increasing. Let
      us take the acreage planted to the various crops. From 1900 to
      1910, the acreage under grain increased by only 3.5% for the
      U.S.A.; under beans, peas, and the like, 26.6%; hay and forage,
      17.2%; cotton, 32%; vegetables, 25.5%; sugar-beets, sugar-cane,
      etc., 62.6%.


Let us examine the crop returns. From 1900 to 1910, the grain
      crop went up only 1.7%; beans, 122.2%; hay and forage, 23%;
      sugar-beets, 395.7%; sugar-cane, 48.5%; potatoes, 42.4%; grapes,
      97.6%; there was a poor crop of berries, apples, etc., in 1910,
      but the orange and lemon crops, etc., were treble those of
      1900.


Thus, the apparently paradoxical but nevertheless proven fact
      bas been shown to apply to U.S. agriculture as a whole

    

that,
      generally speaking, small-scale production is not only being
      displaced by large scale production, but also that this
      displacement is taking place in the following form:


Small-scale
      production is being crowded out by large-scale production
      through the displacement of farms which are “larger” in acreage,
      but are less productive, less intensive and less capitalist, by
      farms which are “smaller” in acreage, but are more productive,
      more intensive, and more capitalist.

12. Different Types of Enterprises
in Agriculture

What I have said above about the intensive, large-scale
      capitalist enterprises on small tracts raises this question: is
      there any reason to believe that the intensification of
      agriculture leads to a reduction of farm acreage? In other
      words, are there any conditions relating to modern farming
      techniques as such that require smaller farm acreage for greater
      intensity of farming?


No answer is provided either by general theoretical reasoning or
      by examples. In each case it is a matter of the concrete
      technical level of agriculture under a given set of conditions,
      and the actual amount of capital required by a given system of
      farming. In theory, any amount of capital can be invested in any
      acreage in any possible way, but it is obvious that “this
      depends” on the existing economic, technical, and cultural
      conditions, etc., and the whole point is the kind of conditions
      prevalent in a given country at a given time. Examples serve no

It is clear that the first two groups of enterprises (hay and

      than the average (0.66 and 0.53 as against 0.90). Farms whose
      principal source of income is livestock naturally have more
      livestock per acre than the average for the U.S.A. (4.45 as
      against 3.66), but appear to be engaged in extensive livestock
      raising: their expenditures for fertilizers are the minimum,
      they have the largest average acreage (226.9 acres) and the
      smallest proportion of improved acreage (86.1 out of 226.9). The

      but other indexes indicative of intensive agriculture (the
      per-acre value of livestock and machinery) are very low.


Finally, the last three groups—vegetables, fruit, and dairy
      produce—include farms which are, first, the smallest in
      acreage (33 to 63 acres of improved land, as against 42 to 86
      and 46 to 111 in the other groups); secondly, the most
      capitalist: they have the heaviest expenditure of hired labour,

    

from 2 to 6 times the average; and thirdly, the most
      intensive. Almost all the indexes of intensive agriculture are
      above the average: the expenditure on fertilizers, the value of
      machinery, the value of livestock (a minor exception are the
      fruit-growing farms which lag behind the average, but are well
      ahead of the farms which derive their income chiefly from hay
      and grain).


Let us now see what is the share of these highly capitalist
      farms in the country’s economy. But we must first examine their
      intensive character in somewhat greater detail.


Take the farms whose main income is derived from vegetables. It
      is well known that in all capitalist countries the development
      of towns, factories, industrial settlements, railway stations,
      ports, etc., stimulates a demand for this type of product, it
      pushes up their prices, and increases the number of agricultural
      enterprises raising them for the market. The average “vegetable”
      farm has less than one-third of the improved acreage of
      an “ordinary” farm deriving income chiefly from hay and grain:
      the former is 33.8 acres, and the latter, 111.1. This means that
      this particular technical level with this particular
      accumulation of capital in agriculture requires “vegetable”
      farms of smaller acreage; in other words, if capital invested in
      agriculture is to yield a not less-than average profit, a
      vegetable-raising farm should have, technology being what it is,
      a smaller acreage than a hay-and grain farm.


But that is not all. The growth of capitalism in agriculture
      consists above all in a transition from natural agriculture to
      commercial agriculture. This is being constantly forgotten, and
      must be brought up again and again. Commercial agriculture, it
      should be noted, does not develop along the “simple” lines
      imagined or projected by bourgeois economists, namely, through
      an ever greater output of the same products. Not at
      all. Commercial agriculture very frequently develops by shifting
      from one type of product to another, and the shift from hay and
      grain to vegetables is very common. But what bearing does it
      have on the question before us, that of farm acreage and the
      growth of capitalism in agriculture?

 

Such a shift signifies the split-up of a “large”
      111.1-acre farm into more than three “small” 33.8-acre
      farms. The old farm produced a value of $760—the average
      value of its products, less the feed raised on the farm, whose
      chief source of income is hay and grain. Each of the new farms
      produces a value of $665, or a total of $665 x 3 = $1,995, i.e.,
      more than double the original figure.


As large-scale production displaces small-scale production, farm
      acreage is reduced.


The average expenditure on hired labour on the old farm was $76;
      on the new farm it is $106, or almost half as much again, while
      acreage is one-third or even less. Expenditure on fertilizers
      has gone up from $0.04 per acre to $0.59, an increase of almost
      15 times; the value of implements and machinery has doubled from
      $1.04 to $2.12, etc.


There will, of course, be the usual objection that the number of
      such highly capitalist farms with specialized “commercial” crops
      is negligible, as compared with the total. The answer is that,
      first, the number and the role, the economic role of
      such farms, are much greater than is generally realized; and
      secondly—and this is the most important point—it
      is such crops that are developed more rapidly than
      others in the capitalist countries. That is just why a reduction
      in farm acreage with the intensification of agriculture so often
      implies an increase and not a reduction in the scale of
      operations, an increase and not a decrease in the exploitation
      of hired labour.


Here are the exact American statistics for the country as a
      whole. Let us take all the special, or “commercial”, crops
      listed above under heads 5-14, namely, vegetables, fruit, dairy
      produce, tobacco, rice, sugar, flowers, nursery products, taro,
      and coffee. In 1900, these products were the principal
      source of income for 12.5% of all farms in the U.S.A. This is
      one-eighth, a very small minority. Their acreage was 8.6%, or
      one-twelfth, of the total. But to continue. Let us take the
      total value of the products of American agriculture (less
      feed). Of this value the farms in question accounted for as much
      as 16%, i.e., their share of the value was almost double their
      share of the acreage.

 

This means that the productivity of labour and land on these
      farms was almost double the average.


Let us take the sum total of expenditure on hired labour in
      American agriculture. Of this total, 26.6%, i.e., over
      one-quarter, fell to the farms in question. This is more than
      three times their share of the acreage, and more than three
      times the average. This means that these farms are very much
      more capitalist than the average.


Their share of the total value of implements and machinery is
      20.1%, and of the expenditures for fertilizers, 31.7%, i.e.,
      slightly less than one-third of the total, and nearly
      four times the average.


Consequently, an incontrovertible fact is established for the
      country as a whole. It is that the especially intensive farms
      have an especially small acreage, especially great employment of
      hired labour, and especially high productivity of labour; that
      the economic role of these farms in the nation’s agriculture is
      two, three and more times greater than their proportion of the
      total number of farms, to say nothing of their share of the
      total acreage.


As time goes on, does the role of these highly capitalist and
      highly intensive crops and farms increase or decrease in
      comparison with other crops and farms?


The answer is provided by a comparison of the last two census
      reports: their role is unquestionably increasing. Let
      us take the acreage planted to the various crops. From 1900 to
      1910, the acreage under grain increased by only 3.5% for the
      U.S.A.; under beans, peas, and the like, 26.6%; hay and forage,
      17.2%; cotton, 32%; vegetables, 25.5%; sugar-beets, sugar-cane,
      etc., 62.6%.


Let us examine the crop returns. From 1900 to 1910, the grain
      crop went up only 1.7%; beans, 122.2%; hay and forage, 23%;
      sugar-beets, 395.7%; sugar-cane, 48.5%; potatoes, 42.4%; grapes,
      97.6%; there was a poor crop of berries, apples, etc., in 1910,
      but the orange and lemon crops, etc., were treble those of
      1900.


Thus, the apparently paradoxical but nevertheless proven fact
      bas been shown to apply to U.S. agriculture as a whole

    

that,
      generally speaking, small-scale production is not only being
      displaced by large scale production, but also that this
      displacement is taking place in the following form:


Small-scale
      production is being crowded out by large-scale production
      through the displacement of farms which are “larger” in acreage,
      but are less productive, less intensive and less capitalist, by
      farms which are “smaller” in acreage, but are more productive,
      more intensive, and more capitalist.

## How the Displacement of Small-Scale by Large-Scale Production in Agriculture is Minimised

    13. How the Displacement of Small-Scale by Large-Scale
      Production in Agriculture is Minimised

The objection may be raised that if the displacement of
      small-scale production “also” proceeds in the form of
      the intensification (and “capitalization”) of operations on the
      smaller-size farms, is the grouping by acreage of any
      use at all? Is this not a case of two contradictory tendencies
      which make any general conclusion impossible?


This objection can be met by a complete picture of
      American agriculture and its evolution; to meet it we must try
      to compare all three methods of grouping which present, as it
      were, the maximum of information social statistics has produced
      in the sphere of agriculture in recent years.


Such a comparison
      is possible. All it calls for is a table which may at first
      sight appear to be so abstract and complex that it may “scare”
      the reader away. However, it takes only a little bit of
      concentration to “read”, understand and analyzes the table.


To compare the three different groupings we need take only their
      percentage ratios. All the necessary calculations are
      given in the American Census report for 1900. Each grouping is
      tabulated under three main heads. By acreage we have:
      (1) small farms (under 100 acres), (2) medium (100 to 175
      acres), and (3) large (175 and over). By value of product we
      have: (1) non-capitalist farms (under $500), (2) medium

    

($500
      to 1.000), and (3) capitalist ($1,000 and over). By the
      principal source of income we take (1) slightly capitalist
      (livestock, cotton), (2) medium (hay and grain; and
      miscellaneous), and (3) highly capitalist (the special
      “commercial” crops listed above, in Chapter 12, under heads 5 to
      14).


For every group we first take the percentage of farms, i.e., the
      number of farms in a given group expressed as a percentage ratio
      of the total number of farms in the U.S.A. We then take the
      percentage of all land, i.e., the total acreage in a given group
      expressed as a percentage ratio of the total acreage of all
      farms in the U.S.A. The acreage serves as an indicator of the
      extensive character of the enterprise (unfortunately, the only
      figures available are for total acreage, instead of the
      improved acreage only, which would have been more exact). If the
      percentage share of the total acreage is higher than
      the percentage share of the number of farms, for example, if
      17.2% of the farms have 43.1% of the land, it is evident that we
      are dealing with large farms, larger-than-average farms, which
      are besides more than double the size of the average farm. The
      reverse is true if the percentage of land is lower than
      the percentage of farms.


Next come the indexes of intensiveness of agriculture:
      the value of implements and machinery, and the total expenditure
      on fertilizers. Here, too, we take the value and the expenditure
      in the given group expressed as a percentage share of the totals
      for the country as a whole. Here again, if the percentage is
      higher than the percentage of land, the
      conclusion is that intensiveness is above the average,
      etc.


Finally, in order to determine exactly the capitalist character
      of the enterprises, the same method is applied to the total
      expenditure on hired labour; while in order to determine the
      scale of production this is done in relation to the total value
      of the agricultural product for the entire country.


This has produced the following table, which I shall now proceed
      to explain and analyze:

Let us consider the first grouping—according to the
      principal source of income. Here farms are grouped, so to say,
      according to their line of farming, which is to some extent
      similar to the grouping of industrial enterprises by branches of
      industry. But the picture is immensely more complex in
      agriculture.


The first column shows the group of slightly capitalist
      farms. It comprises almost one-half the total number of
      farms—46%. They own 52.9% of the total a acreage, i.e.,
      they are larger than average (this group includes both the very
      large, extensive, livestock farms and the smaller-than-average
      cotton farms). Their shares of the value of machinery (37.2%)
      and the expenditure on fertilizers (36.5%) are lower than their
      acreage percentages, which means that their intensiveness is
      lower than the average. The same thing is true of the capitalist
      character of the enterprise (35.2%) and the value of the product
      (45%). Hence, their productivity of labour is lower than the
      average.


The second column shows the medium farms. Because farms which
      are “medium” in every respect fall into the medium
      group by all three methods of grouping, we find here
      that all their percentage ratios are closer to each
      other than in any of the other groups. The fluctuations are
      relatively small.


The third column shows the highly capitalist farms. I gave above
      a detailed analysis of what the figures in this column mean. Be
      it noted that only for this type of farm do we have
      accurate and comparable data both for 1900 and 1910—data
      testifying that these highly capitalist crops have a faster
      than-average rate of development.


In what way is this more rapid development evident in the
      ordinary classification in use in most countries? This is shown
      in the next column: the small farms grouped by acreage.


This group consists of a great number of farms (57.5 por cent of
      the total). Its acreage is only 17.5% of the total, i.e., less
      than one-third of the average. Hence, this is the “poorest”
      group, the most “land-starved” group. But then we and that it
      has a higher-than-average intensiveness of agriculture (the
      value of machinery and expenditures for

    

fertilizers); that it is
      more capitalist (expenditures for hired labour); and that it has
      a higher-than-average-productivity of labour (value of
      product): 22.3 to 41.9% with 17.5% of the acreage.


What is the explanation? Obviously that an especially large
      number of highly capitalist farms—see the
      preceding vertical column—fall into this “small”-acreage
      group. A minority of rich, capital-owning farmers
      conducting large scale capitalist operations on small tracts of
      land are added to a majority of really small farmers who have
      little land and little capital. Such farmers make up only 12.5%
      ( = the percentage of highly capitalist farms) of the total in
      America, which means that even if they were all to be put into
      this one group of small-acreage farms, 45% of the farmers in
      that group (57.5—12.5) would still be short of land and
      capital. Actually, of course, a part of the highly capitalist
      farms, even if only a small one, consists of medium and
      large-acreage farms, so that the figure of 45% in fact
      understates the actual number of farmers who have
      little land and no capital.


It will be easily seen how the condition of these 45%—a
      minimum of 45%—of the farmers who are poor in land and
      capital is embellished by the inclusion into the same
      group of some 12,10 or so per cent of farmers who are supplied
      with higher-than-average amounts of capital, machinery, money to
      buy fertilizers, hire labour, and the rest of it.


I shall not dwell separately on the medium and large farms of
      this grouping, for this would be to repeat, in slightly
      different words what has been said about the small farms. For
      instance, if the data on the small-acreage farms put a better
      complexion on the oppressed condition of small-scale
      production, the data on the large-acreage farms
      obviously minimize the actual concentration of
      agriculture by large-scale production. We shall presently see an
      exact statistical expression of this minimized concentration.


We thus arrive at the following general proposition which may be
      formulated as a law applicable to the grouping of farms by
      acreage in any capitalist country:


The broader and more rapid the intensification of agriculture,
      the more the classification by acreage serves to give
    

a rosy picture of the oppressed condition of
      small-scale production in agriculture, the condition of the
      small farmer who is short of both land and
      capital; the more it serves to blunt the real sharpness
      of the class contradiction between the prospering large-scale
      producer and the small-scale producer going to the wall; the
      more it serves to minimize the concentration of capital
      in the hands of big operators and the displacement of the
      small.


This is graphically confirmed by the third, and last,
      classification, according to the value of product. The
      percentage of non-capitalistic farms (or not very profitable
      farms in terms of gross income) is 58.8%, i.e., even somewhat
      more than the “small” farms (57.5%). They have much
      more land than the group of “small” farmers (33.3% as
      against 17.5%). But their share of the total value of the
      product is one-third smaller : 22.1% as against 33.5%!


What is the explanation? It is that this group does not include
      the highly capitalistic farms on small tracts which have
      artificially and falsely inflated the small farmers’
      share of the capital in the form of machinery, fertilizers,
      etc.


Thus, the oppression and dispossession—and hence the
      ruin—of the small producer in agriculture turn out
      to be much more advanced than one would suppose from
      the data on small farms.


The returns for the small and large farms, grouped by acreage,
      take no account of the role of capital, and the failure
      to reckon with this “trifle” in capitalist enterprise distorts
      the condition of the small producer, puts a false colour on it,
      for it “could be” tolerable “but for” the existence of capital,
      i.e., the power of money, and the relationship between the hired
      labourer and the capitalist, between the farmer and the merchant
      and creditor, etc.


For that reason the concentration of agriculture as shown by the
      large farms is much lower than its concentration as shown by
      large-scale, i.e., capitalist, production:
      39.2% of the value of the product (slightly more than double the
      average) is concentrated on 17.7% of “large” farms, while 52.3%
      of the total value of the product, i.e., more than
      three times the average, is concentrated on 17.2%
      capitalist farms.

 

In the country which practices the free distribution of vast
      tracts of unoccupied land, and which the
Manilovs[1] consider a
      country of “family” farms, more than one-half of the
      total agricultural production is concentrated in about one-sixth
      of the capitalist enterprises, whose expenditure on
      hired labour is four times greater than the per-farm average
      (69.1% on 17.2% of the total number of farms), and are half as
      great again as the per-acre average (69.1% of the expenditure on
      hired labour on farms owning 43.1% of the total amount of
      land).


At the other pole, more than one-half, almost three-fifths, of
      the total number of farms (58.8%) are non-capitalist. They have
      one-third of the land (33.3%) but on it they have less than the
      average quantity of machinery (25.3% of the value of machinery);
      they use less fertilizers than the average (29.1% of the
      expenditures for fertilizers) and so its productivity is only
      two-thirds of the average. With one-third of the total
      acreage, this immense number of-farms, which suffer the greatest
      oppression under the yoke of capital, produce less than
      one-quarter (22.1%) of the total product and of its total
      value.


Consequently, we arrive at a general conclusion concerning the
      significance of classification by acreage, namely, that it is
      not entirely useless. The one thing that should never be
      forgotten is that it understates the displacement of small-scale
      by large-scale production, and that the understatement increases
      with the pace and scope of intensification of agriculture, and
      with the gap between the amounts of capital invested by the
      farms per unit of land. With modern methods of research, which
      produce an abundance of sound information about each farm, it
      would, for instance, be sufficient to combine two methods of
      classification—say, each of the five acreage groups could
      bo broken down into two or three subgroups according to the
      employment of hired labour. If this is not done it is largely
      because of the fear of giving a much too naked picture of
      reality, a much too striking picture of the oppression,
      impoverishment, ruin, expropriation of the mass of small
      farmers, whose condition is so “conveniently” and “unnoticeably”
      made to look better by the “model” capitalist enterprises, which
      are also “small” in acreage and which are a small minority
      within the mass of

    

the dispossessed. From the scientific
      standpoint no one would dare deny that not only land, but also
      capital has a part to play in modern agriculture. From the
      standpoint of statistical techniques, or the amount of
      statistical work involved, a total number of 10 to 15 groups is
      not at all excessive in com parison, for instance, with the 18
      plus 7 groups based on acreage given in the German statistical
      report of 1907. This report, which classifies an abundance of
      material about 5,736,082 farms into the above number of acreage
      groups, is an example of bureaucratic routine, scientific
      rubbish, a meaningless juggling of figures, for there is not
      a shadow of any reasonable, rational, theoretical or
      practical ground for accepting such a number of groups as
      typical.

New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    14. The Expropriation of the Small Farmers

The question of the expropriation of the small farmers is
      immensely important to an understanding and assessment of
      capitalism in agriculture in general, and it is highly
      characteristic of modern political economy and statistics, which
      are saturated through and through with bourgeois notions and
      prejudices, that this question is either practically not
      considered at all or is given the least attention.


The general statistics in all capitalist countries show that the
      urban population is growing at the expense of the rural, that
      the population is abandoning the countryside. In the U.S.A.,
      this process is steadily advancing. The proportion of the urban
      population increased from 29.5% in 1880, to 36.1% in 1890, 40.5%
      in 1900, and 46.3% in 1910. In every part of the country the
      urban population is growing more rapidly than the rural
      population: from 1900 to l910, the rural population in the
      industrial North-went up by 3.9% and the urban by 29.8%; in the
      former slave-holding South, the rural population increased by
      14.8%, and the urban, by 41.4%; in the homestead West, the
      figures were 49.7 and 89.6%, respectively.


One should think that such a universal process would also have
      to be studied in the taking of agricultural censuses. A most
      important question from the scientific standpoint naturally
      arises as to what sections, strata or groups of the

    

rural
      population provide the fugitives from the countryside and in
      what circumstances. Since highly detailed information about each
      agricultural enterprise and about each animal in it is collected
      every ten years, it would be no trouble at all to include
      questions as to how many and what kind of farms were sold or
      rented with an eye to moving into town, and how many members of
      households abandoned farming temporarily or for good, and in
      what circumstances. But no such questions are asked: the
      investigation does not go beyond the official stereotyped
      statement: “The rural population decreased from 59.5% in 1900 to
      53.7% in 1910.” The census-takers seem to have no inkling of the
      mass of misery, oppression and ruin concealed behind these
      routine figures. As a general rule, bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois economists turn a blind eye to the obvious
      connection between the night of the population from the
      countryside and the ruin of the small producers.


There is no alternative, therefore, but to try and bring
      together the relatively meager and very badly compiled data on
      the expropriation of the small farmers gleaned from the 1910
      Census report.


There are the figures on the forms of farm tenure: the number of
      owners, subdivided into full and part owners;
      and the number of share-cropping tenants and cash-paying
      tenants. These figures are tabulated for the various divisions
      but not the farm groups.


Here is the first picture we get from the totals for 1900 and 1910:




Total rural population increase

Total number of farms increased

Total number of owners increased

Total number of full owners increased 


11.2%

10.9%

8.1%

4.8%



This picture is a clear indication of the growing expropriation
      of small-scale agriculture. The rural population is increasing
      more slowly than the urban. The number of farmers is increasing
      more slowly than the rural population; the number of owners is
      increasing more slowly than the number of farmers; the number of
      full owners—more slowly than the number of owners
      in general.


The proportion of owners in the total number of farmers has been
      decreasing steadily over a period of several decades, as
      follows:

    




1880

1890

1900

1910 


74.0%

71.6%

64.7%
 

63.0%



There is a corresponding growth in the proportion of tenants,
      with the number of share-cropping tenants going up faster than
      that of cash-paying tenants. The number of share-cropping
      tenants was 17.5% in 1880; then it rose to 18.4% and 22.2%, and
      finally to 24% in 1910.


It is evident from the following figures that the decrease in
      the proportion of owners and the increase in the proportion of
      tenants is, on the whole, an indication of the dispossession and
      displacement of the small farmers:

According to all the returns for both census years the owners
      are economically stronger. The condition of the tenants is
      deteriorating more rapidly than that of the owners.


Let us examine separately the figures for the sections.


The greatest number of tenants, as I have already said, is in
      the South, and there tenancy has the fastest rate of growth: it
      rose from 47% in 1900, to 49.6% in 1910. Capital defeated
      slavery half a century ago, merely to restore it now in
      a new form as share tenancy.


In the North, the number of tenants is considerably smaller and
      is growing at a much slower rate: it went up from 26.2% in 1900,
      to only 26.5% in 1910. The West has the smallest number of
      tenants, and it is the only section where tenancy,
      instead of increasing, decreased: it fell from 16.6% in 1900 to
      14.0% in l910. “A very low proportion of tenant farms,” says the
      Census report for 1910, “is also shown for the Mountain and
      Pacific divisions,
[the two divisions constituting “The West”][1]

,

where it is

    

doubtless attributable mainly to
      the fact that those divisions have been only recently settled
      and that many of the farmers in them are homesteaders who have
      obtained their land from the Government” free or for a very
      small price (Vol. V, p. 104).


This is a striking example of the peculiar characteristic of the
      U.S.A., to which I have repeatedly referred, namely, the
      availability of unoccupied, free land. This explains, on the one
      hand, the extremely rapid and extensive development of
      capitalism in America. The absence of private property in land
      in some parts of a vast country does not exclude
      capitalism—our Narodniks should make a note of
      this!—on the contrary, it broadens its base, and
      accelerates its development. Upon the other hand, this
      peculiarity, which is entirely unknown in the old, long-settled
      capitalist countries of Europe, serves in America to cover
      up the expropriation of the small farmers—a process
      already under way in the settled and most industrialized parts
      of the country.


Let us take the North. We get the following picture:

We see not only a relative reduction in the number of owners,
      not only a decline in their proportion of the total number of
      farmers, etc., but even an absolute decrease in the
      number of owners, against a background of growing production in
      the main section of the U.S.A., which embraces 60% of the
      country’s improved acreage!


It should, besides, be borne in mind that in one of the four
      divisions making up the North, namely, the West North Central,
      the allotment of homesteads continues to this very day,
      and that 54 million acres were allotted in the 10 years from
      1901 to 1910.


The tendency of capitalism to expropriate small-scale
      agriculture is so strong that the American “North” shows an
      absolute decrease in the number of landowners, in
      spite of the distribution of tens of millions of acres of
      unoccupied, free land.

 

Only two factors still serve to paralyze this tendency in the
      U.S.A.: (1) the existence of the still unparcelled slave-holding
      plantations in the South, with its oppressed and downtrodden
      Negro population; and (2) the fact that the West is still partly
      unsettled. Both these factors tend to widen the future base of
      capitalism, and so prepare the conditions for its even more
      extensive and more rapid development. The sharpening of
      contradictions and the displacement of small-scale production
      are not removed but are transferred to a larger arena. The
      capitalist fire appears to be “damped down”—but at the
      price of an even greater accumulation of new and more
      inflammable material.


Furthermore, on the question of the expropriation of small-scale
      agriculture, we have the returns for the number of farms owning
      livestock. Here are the figures for the U.S.A.

These figures show, on the whole, a reduction in the number of
      owners in proportion to the total number of farmers. The
      increase in the percentage of those who owned dairy cows was
      smaller than the drop in the percentage of those who owned
      horses.


Let us now examine the figures for farms grouped in relation to
      the two major kinds of livestock.

We find that the greatest increase was in the number of small
      farms with dairy cows, then came the latifundia, and then the
      medium-size farms. There was a decrease in the

    

percentage of
      farms reporting dairy cows among the big owners, with 500 to 999
      acres of land.


On the whole, this seems to indicate a gain for small-scale
      agriculture. Let us recall, however, that in farming the
      ownership of dairy cattle has a twofold significance: on the one
      hand, it may generally indicate a higher living standard and
      better conditions of nutrition. On the other hand, it
      signifies—and rather more frequently—a development of
      one branch of commercial farming and cattle-breeding: the
      production of milk for the market in the towns and industrial
      centers. We saw above that farms of this type, the “dairy”
      farms, were classified by American statisticians under a special
      head, according to the principal source of income. A
      characteristic of this group is that it has a
      smaller-than-average total and improved acreage, but a
      greater-than-average value of output, and a
      double-the-average
      employment of hired labour per acre. The increasing importance
      of small farms in dairy farming may simply mean—and most
      likely does mean—a growth of capitalist dairy
      farms of the type described, on small tracts of land. For the
      sake of comparison here are some figures on the
      concentration of dairy cattle in America:

We find that the North, which is richest of all in dairy cattle,
      also showed the greatest increase in wealth. Here is a
      distribution of this increase among the groups:

The more rapid growth in the number of small farms with
      dairy cattle did not prevent its more rapid
      concentration in the large enterprises.


Let us now turn to the figures on the number of farms reporting
      horses. This information about draught animals is an indication
      of the general pattern of farming and not of any special branch
      of commercial farming.

We find that as we go down the size-group scale there is a
      rising number of farms not reporting horses. With the exception
      of the smallest farms (under 20 acres) which, as we know,
      include a comparatively greater number of capitalistic farms
      than the neighboring groups, we observe a rapid decrease in the
      number of horseless farms and a much slower increase in their
      number. The use of steam ploughs and other engines on the rich
      farms may partly compensate for the reduction in draught
      animals, but such an assumption is out of the question for the
      mass of the poorer farms.


Finally, the growth of expropriation is also evident from the
      returns on the number of mortgaged farms:

The percentage of mortgaged farms is on a steady increase in all
      sections, and it is highest in the most populous industrialized
      and capitalist North. American statisticians point out (Vol. V,
      p. 159) that the growth in the number of mortgaged

    

farms in the
      South is probably due to the “parceling out” of the plantations,
      which are sold in lots to Negro and white farmers, who pay only
      a part of the purchase price, the rest being covered by a
      mortgage on the property. Consequently a peculiar buying-up
      operation is under way in the slave-holding South. Let us
      note that in 1910 Negroes in the U.S.A. owned only 920,883
      farms, i.e., 14.5% of the total; between 1900 and 1910, the
      number of white farms increased 9.5%, and that of Negro farms,
      twice as fast—19.6%. The Negro urge to emancipation from
      the “plantation owners” half a century after the “victory” over
      the slave-owners is still marked by an exceptional intensity.


The American statisticians also point out that the mortgaging of
      a farm does not always indicate lack of prosperity; it is
      sometimes a way of obtaining capital for land improvement; and
      the like. This is indisputable, but this indisputable
      observation should not conceal the fact—as is much too
      often the case with bourgeois economists—that only a
      well-to-do minority are in a position to obtain capital for
      improvements, etc., in this way, and to employ it productively;
      the majority are further impoverished and fall into the clutches
      of finance capital assuming this particular form.


Researchers could—and should—have paid much more
      attention to the dependence of farmers on finance capital. But
      although this aspect of the matter is immensely important, it
      has remained in the background.


The growth in the number of mortgaged farms in any case means
      that the actual control over them is transferred to the
      capitalists. It stands to reason that apart from officially
      recorded and notarized mortgages, a considerable number of farms
      are steeped in private debt, which is not covered by strict
      legal instruments and is not recorded by the census.

    15. A Comparative Picture of Evolution in Industry and Agriculture

American census statistics, for all their shortcomings, compare
      favorably with those of other countries because of the
      completeness and uniformity of the methods used.

    

This makes it
      possible to compare the returns for industry and agriculture for
      1900 and 1910, and to contrast the over all picture of the
      structure of both sectors of the economy and the evolution of
      this structure. One of the most popular ideas in bourgeois
      economics—an idea, incidentally, which Mr. Himmer
      repeats—is to contrast industry and
      agriculture. Let us see, in the light of a mass of precise data,
      what truth there is in such a contrast.


Let us begin with the number of enterprises in industry and in agriculture.

The enterprises in agriculture are much more numerous and much
      smaller. That is an expression of its backwardness,
      parcellization, and dispersion.


The number of enterprises increases much more slowly in
      agriculture than in industry. There are two factors in the
      United States which do not exist in other leading countries, and
      which greatly intensify and accelerate the growth in the number
      of enterprises in agriculture. They are, first, the continued
      parceling out of the slave-holding latifundia in the South and
      “buying-up” by Negro and also by white farmers of small parcels
      from the “planters”; secondly, the availability of an immense
      quantity of unoccupied, free land, which is distributed by the
      government to all applicants. Nevertheless the number of
      enterprises in agriculture is increasing at a slower rate than
      in industry.


The reason is twofold. On the one hand, agriculture to a rather
      large extent retains the character of a “natural” economy, and
      various operations once performed by members of a peasant
      household are gradually branching off from agriculture—for
      example, the making and repair of various implements, utensils,
      etc.—and now constitute separate industries. On the other
      hand, there is a monopoly which is peculiar to agriculture and
      unknown to industry, and which cannot be eliminated under
      capitalism—the monopoly of land ownership. Even when there
      is no private property in

    

land—in the United States none
      actually exists on very large areas to this very
      day—monopoly is created by the ownership of land and its
      occupation by individual private operators. In the country’s
      most important regions all the land is occupied, and an increase
      in the number of agricultural enterprises is possible only when
      existing enterprises are broken up; the free formation of new
      enterprises alongside the old is impossible. The monopoly of
      land ownership is a drag on the development of agriculture, and
      this monopoly retards the development of capitalism in
      agriculture, which, therefore, is unlike industry in this
      respect.


We are unable to make an accurate comparison of the amounts of
      capital invested in industrial and in agricultural enterprises
      because ground-rent forms a part of the value of the
      land. Accordingly, we have to compare the capital invested in
      industry and the value of industrial products with the total
      value of all farm property and the value of the major farm
      product. Only the percentages showing increases in the total
      values on both sides are strictly comparable.

We find that during the 10 years from 1900 to 1910 the value of
      capital invested in industry and the value of all farm property
      have doubled. The great and fundamental difference between the
      two is that in agriculture the major product, cereals, increased
      by an insignificant 1.7%—while the total population
      increased 21%.


Agriculture lags behind industry in development; this is a
      feature of all capitalist countries constituting one of the most
      profound causes of disproportion between the various branches of
      the economy, of crises and soaring prices.


Capital liberated agriculture from feudalism and drew it into
      commodity circulation and thereby into world

    

      economic development, lifting it from medieval backwardness and
      patriarchal stagnation. But capital, instead of eliminating the
      oppression, exploitation and poverty of the masses, produces
      these calamities in a new guise and restores their old forms on
      a “modern” basis. The contradiction between industry and
      agriculture, far from being eliminated by capitalism, is, on the
      contrary, further extended and sharpened by it. The oppression
      of capital, seen primarily in the sphere of trade and industry,
      weighs more and more heavily on agriculture.


The insignificant increase in the quantity of agricultural
      produce (+1.7%) and the enormous increase in its value (+79.8%)
      shows clearly, on the one hand, the role of ground-rent, the
      tribute extorted from society by the landowners. Because of
      their monopolist position, they are able to take advantage of
      the backwardness of agriculture, which does not keep pace with
      industry, and to fill their pockets with millions and millions
      of dollars. In the 10 years, the value of all farm property
      increased by $20,500 million, of which only $5,000 million
      constituted the increase in the value of buildings, livestock
      and equipment. The value of land—capitalized
      ground-rent—increased in the 10 years by
      $15,000 million (+118.1%).


On the other hand, the difference in the class status
      of the small farmers and the hired labourers is here thrown into
      especially sharp relief. To be sure, both labour; to be sure,
      both are subject to exploitation by capital, though in entirely
      different forms. But only vulgar bourgeois democrats will for
      this reason put the two different classes together and speak of
      small-scale operations by family farms. To do so is to cover up
      and disguise the social system of the economy—its
      bourgeois nature—and push into the foreground a feature
      common to all earlier formations, namely, the necessity
      for the petty farmer to work, to engage in personal, physical
      labour, if he is to survive.


Under capitalism, the small farmer—whether he wants to or
      not, whether he is aware of it or not—becomes a commodity
      producer. And it is this change that is fundamental, for it
      alone, even when he does not as yet exploit hired labour, makes
      him a petty bourgeois and converts him into an antagonist of the
      proletariat. He sells his product, while

    

the proletarian sells
      his labour-power. The small farmers, as a class, cannot but seek
      a rise in the prices of agricultural products, and this is
      tantamount to their joining the big landowners in sharing the
      ground-rent, and siding with the landowners against the rest of
      society. As commodity production develops, the small farmer, in
      accordance with his class status, inevitably becomes a
      petty landed proprietor.


There are cases even among wage-workers when a small part of
      them side with their masters against the whole class of
      wage-earners. But this is merely a small fraction of a
      class uniting with its antagonists, against the entire
      class. It is impossible to imagine any improvement of the
      condition of wage-earners as a class, without an improvement in
      the living standard of the masses, or without a sharpening of
      the antagonism between them and capital, which rules
      contemporary society, the antagonism between them and the entire
      class of capitalists. But it is quite possible, on the contrary,
      to imagine a state of affairs—indeed, such a situation is
      even typical of capitalism—where an improvement in the
      condition of the small farmers, as a class, results from their
      alliance with the big landlords, their participation in exacting
      a higher ground-rent from society as a whole, the contradictions
      arising between them and the mass of proletarians and
      semi-proletarians, who depend, entirely or at least mostly, on
      the sale of their labour-power.


Here is a comparison of American statistics on the number and
      position of wage-earners and of small farmers:

The workers in industry lost, for their wages went up by only
      70.6% (“only”, because almost the same quantity

    

of cereals,
      101.7% of the old quantity, is now 179.8% of the old price!),
      while the number of workers in creased all of 40%.


The small farmers gained, in their capacity of petty
      landowners, at the expense of the proletariat. The number of
      small farmers increased by only 10.9% (even if the small
      commercial farms are singled out, the increase is still only
      11.9%), and while the quantity of their product hardly increased
      at all (+1.7%), its value went up 79.8%.


Naturally, commercial and finance capital took the lion’s share
      of this ground-rent, but the class status of the small farmer
      and the wage-earner, vis-à-vis each other, is entirely
      akin to the status of petty bourgeois and proletarian.


The numerical growth of wage-earners outstrips the
      growth of population (+40% for the former as against +21% for
      the latter). There is growing expropriation of the petty
      producers and small farmers. There is growing proletarization of
      the population. [1]


The increase in the number of farmers—and to an even
      greater extent, as we already know, in the number of proprietors
      among them—lags behind the growth of the
      population (10.9%, as against 21%). The small farmers are
      increasingly converted into monopolists, into petty landed
      proprietors.


Let us now take a look at the relationship between small-scale
      and large-scale production in industry and in agriculture. In
      respect of industry the figures are not for 1900 and 1910, but
      for 1904 and 1910.


Industrial enterprises are divided into three main groups
      depending on the value of their products, the small being those
      with an output of less than $20,000; the medium, from $20,000 to
      $100,000, and the large $100,000 and over. We have no way of
      grouping agricultural enterprises except by
      acreage. Accordingly, small farms are those up to 100 acres;
      medium, from 100 to 175; and large, 175 and over.

The uniformity of evolution proves to be remarkable.


Both in industry and agriculture the proportion of medium
      establishments is reduced, for their number grows more slowly
      than that of the small and large enterprises.


Both in industry and agriculture the small enterprises increase
      in number at a slower rate than the large.


What are the changes in the economic strength or economic role
      of the various types of enterprises? For the industrial
      enterprises we have the returns on the value of their products,
      and for the agricultural, on the total value of all farm
      property.

Once again the uniformity of evolution is remarkable.


Both in industry and agriculture the relative number of, small
      and medium enterprises is decreasing, and only the relative
      number of the large enterprises is increasing.


In other words, the displacement of small-scale by large-scale
      production is under way both in industry and in agriculture.

 

The difference between industry and agriculture in this case is
      that the proportion of small enterprises in industry increased
      somewhat more than the proportion of medium enterprises (+21.5%,
      as against +19.5%), while the reverse was true for
      agriculture. Of course, this difference is not great, and no
      general conclusions can be drawn from it. But the fact remains
      that in the world’s leading capitalist country small-scale
      production in industry gained more ground in the last decade
      than medium-scale production, whereas the reverse was true for
      agriculture. This fact shows how little importance is to be
      attached to the current assertions of bourgeois economists that
      the law of the displacement of small-scale by large-scale
      production is confirmed, unconditionally and without any
      exception, by industry, and refuted by agriculture.


In the agriculture of the U.S.A. the displacement of small-scale
      by large-scale production is not merely under way, but is
      proceeding with greater uniformity than in industry.


In considering this, the fact demonstrated above should not be
      forgotten, namely, that the grouping of farms by acreage
      understates the process of displacement of small-scale
      by large-scale production.


As for the degree of concentration already achieved,
      agriculture is very far behind. In industry, more than
      eight-tenths of all production is in the hands of the large
      enterprises that constitute only 11% of the total number. The
      role of the small enterprises is insignificant: two-thirds of
      the total number of enterprises account for only 5.5% of the
      total production! By comparison, agriculture is still in a state
      of dispersion: small enterprises, comprising 58% of the total
      number, account for one-quarter of the total value of all farm
      property; while 18% large enterprises account for less than
      one-half (47%). The total number of agricultural enterprises is
      over 20 times greater than the number in industry.


This confirms the old conclusion—if the evolution of
      agriculture is compared with that of industry, capitalism in
      agriculture is at a stage more akin to the manufactory stage
      than to the stage of large-scale machine industry. Manual labour
      still prevails in agriculture, and the use of machinery is
      relatively very limited. But the data given

    

above do not in any
      way prove the impossibility of socializing agricultural
      production, even at the present stage of its development. Those
      who control the banks directly control one-third of
      America’s farms, and indirectly dominate the lot. In view of the
      modern development of associations of every kind and of
      communications and transport, it is undoubtedly possible to
      organize production under a single general plan on a million
      farms raising more than one-half the total value of the
      product.

 

Notes
 

[1]

The number of wage-earners in agriculture, or rather the growth in
their number, is obtained from the following ratio: 82.3:70.6
      =x : 40.4, hence x=47.1.

V. I.  

      Lenin
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture
PART ONE—Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America



    

    16. Summary and Conclusions

The agricultural censuses taken in the United States in 1900 and
      1910 are the last word in social statistics in this sphere of
      the economy. It is the best material of any available in the
      advanced countries, covering millions of farms and allowing
      precise well-founded conclusions on the evolution of agriculture
      under capitalism. One other particular reason why this material
      can be used to study the laws of the evolution is that the
      U.S.A. has the largest size, the greatest diversity of
      relationships, and the greatest range of nuances and forms of
      capitalist agriculture.


We find here, on the one hand, a transition from the
      slave-holding—or what is in this case the same, from the
      feudal—structure of agriculture to commercial and
      capitalist agriculture; and, on the other hand, capitalism
      developing with unusual breadth and speed in the freest and most
      advanced bourgeois country. We observe alongside of this
      remarkably extensive colonization conducted on democratic
      capitalist lines.


We find here areas which have long been settled, highly
      industrialized, highly intensive, and similar to most of the
      areas of civilized, old-capitalist Western Europe; as well as
      areas of primitive, extensive cropping and stock-raising, like
      some of the outlying areas of Russia or parts of Siberia. We
      find large and small farms of the most diverse types: great
      latifundia, plantations of the former slave-holding South, and
      the homestead West, and the highly capitalist North of the
      Atlantic seaboard; the small farms of the Negro share-croppers,
      and the small capitalist farms producing milk and vegetables for
      the market in the industrial North

    

or fruits on the Pacific
      coast; “wheat factories” employing hired labour and the
      homesteads of “independent” small farmers, still full
      of naïve illusions about living by the “labour of their own
      hands”.


This is a remarkable diversity of relationships, embracing both
      past and future, Europe and Russia. The comparison with Russia
      is especially instructive, by the way, in regard to the question
      of the consequences of a possible transfer of all land to the
      peasants without compensation, a measure that is progressive but
      undoubtedly capitalist.


The U.S.A. offers the most convenient example for the study of
      the general laws of capitalist development in agriculture and
      the variety of forms these laws assume. A study of this kind
      leads up to conclusions which may be summed up in the following
      brief propositions.


In agriculture, as compared with industry, manual labour
      predominates over machinery to an immeasurably greater
      extent. But the machine is steadily advancing, improving farming
      techniques, extending the scale of operations and making them
      more capitalist. In modern agriculture, machinery is used in the
      capitalist way.


Hired labour is the chief sign and indicator of capitalism in
      agriculture. The development of hired labour, like the growing
      use of machinery, is evident in all parts of the
      country, and in every branch of agriculture. The growth in the
      number of hired labourers outstrips the growth of the country’s
      rural and total population. The growth in the number of farmers
      lags behind that of the rural population. Class contradictions
      are intensified and sharpened.


The displacement of small-scale by large-scale production in
      agriculture is going forward. This is fully proved by a
      comparison of the returns for 1900 and 1910 on total farm
      property.


However, this displacement is understated, and the condition of
      the small farmers is shown in bright colors because
      statisticians in America in 1910 confined themselves—as in
      fact they did almost everywhere in Europe—to grouping the
      farms by acreage. The wider and faster the intensification of
      agriculture, the higher is the degree of this understatement and
      the brighter the colors.

 

Capitalism grows not only by accelerating the development of
      large-acreage farms in extensive areas, but also by creating in
      the intensive areas enterprises on smaller tracts whose
      operations are on a much larger scale and are much more
      capitalist.


As a result, the concentration of production in the large
      enterprises is actually much greater—and the displacement
      of small-scale production actually goes farther and
      deeper—than is indicated by ordinary data about farms
      grouped by acreage. The returns of the 1900 Census, compiled
      with greater care and in greater detail, are more scientific and
      leave no doubt at all on this score.


The expropriation of small-scale agriculture is advancing. In
      the last few decades, the proportion of owners to the total
      number of farmers declined steadily, while the growth in the
      number of farmers lagged behind population increase. The number
      of full owners is declining absolutely in the North, the most
      important section, which yields the largest volume of farm
      products and has neither any vestiges of slavery nor any
      extensive homesteading. In the last decade, the proportion of
      farmers reporting livestock in general decreased; in contrast to
      the increased proportion of owners reporting dairy cattle there
      was an even greater increase in the proportion of operators
      without horses, especially among the small farmers.


On the whole, a comparison of corresponding data on industry and
      agriculture for the same period shows that although the latter
      is incomparably more backward, there is a remarkable similarity
      in the laws of evolution, and that small-scale production is
      being ousted-from both.

There is no need for any special explanation to show that
the subject dealt with in Bukharin’s paper is topical and important. The
question of imperialism is not only one of the most essential but is
probably the most essential question in that sphere of economic
science which traces the change in the forms of capitalism in modern
times. Anyone interested not only in economics but in any aspect of con
temporary social life must certainly acquaint himself with the facts
pertaining to this sphere which the author has collected in such abundance
from the latest material. It goes without saying, that there can be no
concrete historical assessment of the current war, unless it is based on a
thorough analysis of the nature of imperialism, both in its economic and
political aspects. Otherwise, it would be impossible to arrive at a correct
understanding of the economic and diplomatic history of the last few
decades without which it would be ridiculous to expect to work out a
correct view of the war. From the standpoint of Marxism, which states most
definitely the requirements of modern science on this question in general,
one can merely smile at the “scientific” value of such methods as taking
the concrete historical assessment of the war to mean a random selection
of facts which the ruling classes of the country find gratifying or
convenient, facts taken at random from diplomatic “documents”, current
political developments, etc. Plekhanov, for instance, must have completely
parted with Marxism to substitute the angling after a couple of little
facts which delighted Purishkevich as much as Milyukov, for an analysis of
the essential properties and tendencies of imperialism, as the system of
economic relations of modern highly developed, mature and rotten-ripe
capitalism. The scientific concept of imperialism, moreover, is reduced to
a sort of term of abuse applied to the immediate competitors, rivals and
opponents

    

of the two imperialists mentioned, each of whom holds exactly the same class
position as his rivals and opponents! This is not at all surprising in
this day of words forgotten, principles lost, philosophies overthrown,
and resolutions and solemn promises discarded.


N. I. Bukharin’s paper has especially high scientific value because he
examines the main facts of the world economy relating to imperialism as a
whole, as a definite stage of development of the most highly developed
capitalism. There was an epoch of relatively “peaceful” capitalism,
when it had completely defeated feudalism in the leading European countries and
was free to develop with the utmost—relative—tranquillity
and smoothness, expanding “peacefully” over the vast expanses of the
as yet unsettled lands and the countries not yet irrevocably drawn into the
capitalist maelstrom. Of course, even in that period, roughly between 1871 and
1914, “peaceful” capitalism created conditions of life that were a
very far cry from actual “peace”, both in the military and the class
sense. For nine-tenths of the population of the leading countries, for hundreds
of millions in the colonies and backward countries, that epoch was not one of
“peace” but of oppression, suffering and horror, which was the more
terrible, possibly, for appearing to be a “horror without end”. This epoch
is gone for good, it has given way to an epoch which is relatively much more
violent, spasmodic, disastrous and conflicting, an epoch which for the mass of
the population is typified not so much by a “horror without end” as
by a “horrible end”.


In all this it is extremely important to bear in mind that this change has been
brought about in no other way but the immediate development, expansion and
continuation of the most profound and basic trends in capitalism and in commodity production in general. These main trends, which have been in evidence all
over the world for centuries, are the growth of exchange and the growth of
large-scale production. At a definite stage in the development of exchange, at
a definite stage in the growth of large-scale production, namely, at the stage
which was attained towards the turn of the century, exchange so
internationalised economic relations and capital, and large-scale production
assumed such proportions that monopoly began to replace free competition.

    

Monopoly associations of entrepreneurs, trusts, instead of enterprises,
“freely” competing with each other—at home and in relations
between the countries—became typical. Finance capital took over as
the typical “lord” of the world; it is particularly mobile and
flexible, particularly interknit at home and internationally, and particularly
impersonal and divorced from production proper; it lends itself to concentration
with particular ease, and has been concentrated to an unusual degree already, so
that literally a few hundred multimillionaires and millionaires control the
destiny of the world.


Abstract theoretical reasoning may lead to the conclusion at which
Kautsky has arrived—in a somewhat different fashion but also by abandoning
Marxism—namely, that the time is not too far off when these magnates of
capital will unite on a world scale in a single world trust, substituting an
internationally united finance capital for the competition and struggle between
sums of finance capital nationally isolated. This conclusion is, however, just
as abstract, simplified and incorrect as the similar conclusion drawn by our
Struvists and Economists of the nineties, when they drew conclusions from the
progressive nature of capitalism, its inevitability and its final victory in
Russia that ranged from the apologetic (admiration for capitalism,
reconciliation with it, and glorification instead of struggle), and the apolitical (that is, a denial of politics or a denial of the importance of politics,
the probability of general political upheavals, etc., a mistake specifically
Economist), to the outrightly “strike-ist” (the “general
strike”, as the apotheosis of the strike movement, brought up to a point
where other forms of movement are forgotten Or ignored ,and capitalism is over
come solely by a “leap” from it to a strike, pure and simple). There
is evidence that even today the indisputable fact that capitalism is
progressive, when compared with the semi-philistine “paradise” of
free competition, and that imperialism and its final victory over
“peaceful” capitalism in the leading countries of the world are
inevitable—that this fact is still capable of producing an equally great
and varied number of political and apolitical mistakes and misadventures.


With Kautsky, in particular, his clear break with Marxism has not taken the
form of a denial or neglect of politics, or of a “leap”
over the political conflicts, upheavals and

    

transformations, so numerous and varied in the imperialist epoch; it has
not taken the form of an apology of imperialism but of a dream of
“peaceful” capitalism. That “peaceful” capitalism has given way to
non-peaceful, aggressive, cataclysmic imperialism Kautsky is forced to
admit, because that is something he had admitted as far back as 1909 in the
paper[1]
in which he last produced some integrated conclusions as a
Marxist. But if it is impossible. to toy in rude, simple fashion with the
dream of a straightforward retreat from imperialism to “peaceful”
capitalism, why not let these dreams, which are essentially
petty-bourgeois, take the form of innocent speculation on
“peaceful” “ultra-imperialism”? If the international
integration of national (rather nationally isolated) imperialisms is to be
called ultra-imperialism, which “could” remove the conflicts, such as
wars, political upheavals, etc., which the petty bourgeois finds especially
unpalatable, disquieting, and alarming, why not, in that case, make an
escape from the present highly conflicting and cataclysmic epoch of
imperialism, which is the here and now, by means of innocent dreams of an
“ultra-imperialism” which is relatively peaceful, relatively lacking in
conflict and relatively uncataclysmic? Why not try to escape the acute
problems that have been and are being posed by the epoch of imperialism
that has dawned for Europe by dreaming up the possibility of it soon
passing away and being followed by a relatively “peaceful” epoch of
“ultra-imperialism” that will not require any “abrupt” tactics? Kautsky
says precisely that “such a [ultra-imperialist] new phase of
capitalism is at any rate imaginable”, but that “there are not yet enough
prerequisites to decide whether or not it is feasible” (Die Neue
Zeit,[2]
April 30, 1915, p. 144).


There is not a whit of Marxism in this urge to ignore the imperialism
which is here and to escape into the realm of an “ultra-imperialism”
which may or may not arrive. In this formulation, Marxism is recognised
in that “new phase of capitalism” which its inventor himself does not
warrant can be realised, while in the present stage (which is
already here) the petty-bourgeois and profoundly reactionary desire to
blunt the contradictions is substituted for Marxism. Kautsky
swore to be a Marxist in this coming, acute and cataclysmic
epoch, which he was forced to predict and recognise

    

very definitely in his 1909 paper on this coming epoch. Now that this epoch
has most definitely arrived, Kautsky once again swears to be a
Marxist in the coming epoch of ultra-imperialism, which may or may not
arrive! In short, any number of promises to be a Marxist in
another epoch, not now, not under present conditions, not in this
epoch! Marxism on credit, Marxism in promises, Marxism tomorrow, a
petty-bourgeois, opportunist theory—and not only a theory—of
blunting contradictions today. This is something like the internationalism
for export which is very popular today with ardent—oh, so
ardent!—internationalists and Marxists who sympathise with every
manifestation of internationalism—in the enemy camp, anywhere, but not at
home, not among their allies; they sympathise with democracy—when it
remains an “allied” promise; they sympathise with “the
self-determination of nations”, but only not of those dependent
on the nation which has the honour of having the sympathiser among its
citizens. In a word, it is one of the 1,001 varieties of hypocrisy.


Can it be denied, however, that a new phase of capitalism is
“imaginable” in the abstract after imperialism, namely,
ultra-imperialism? No, it cannot. Such a phase can be imagined. But in
practice this means becoming an opportunist, turning away from the acute
problems of the day to dream of the unacute problems of the future. In
theory this means refusing to be guided by actual developments,
forsaking them arbitrarily for such dreams. There is no doubt that
the trend of development is towards a single world trust absorbing
all enterprises without exception and all states without exception. But
this development proceeds in such circumstances, at such a pace, through
such contradictions, conflicts and upheavals—not only economic but
political, national, etc.—that inevitably imperialism will burst and
capitalism will be transformed into its opposite long before one
world trust materialises, before the “ultra-imperialist”,
world-wide amalgamation of national finance capitals takes place.

Has the Second
International really ceased to exist?  This is being stubbornly
denied by its most authoritative representatives, like Kautsky
and Vandervelde. Their
point of view is that, save for the rupture of relations,
nothing has really happened; all is quite well.


To get at the truth of the matter, let is turn to the 
Manifesto
of the Basle Congress of 1912, which applies
particularly to the present imperialist world war and which
was accepted by all the socialist parties of the world. No
socialist, be it noted, will dare in theory deny the
necessity of making a concrete, historical appraisal of
every war.


Now that war has broken out, neither the avowed opportunists nor
the Kautskyites dare repudiate the Basle Manifesto or compare its demands
with the conduct of the socialist parties during the war. Why? Because
the Manifesto completely exposes both.


There is not a single word in the Basle Manifesto about the defence of
the fatherland, or about the difference between a war of aggression
and a war of defence; there is nothing in it at all about what the
opportunists and Kautskyites[1]

of Germany and of the Quadruple
Alliance[8] at
all crossroads are now dinning into the ears of the world. Nor could
it have said anything of the sort, because what it does say absolutely
rules out the use of such concepts. It makes a highly concrete
reference to the series of political

    

and economic conflicts which had
for decades been preparing the ground for the present war, had become
quite apparent in 1912, and which brought about the war In 1914. The
Manifesto recalls the Russo-Austrian conflict for “hegemony in the
Balkans”; the conflicts between Britain, France and Germany (between
all these countries!) over their “policy of conquest in Asia
Minor”; the Austro-Italian conflict over the “striving for domination”
in Albania, etc. In short, the Manifesto defines all these as
conflicts emanating from “capitalist imperialism”. Thus, the Manifesto
very clearly recognises the predatory, imperialist, reactionary,
slave-driving character of the present war, i.e., a character which
makes the idea of defending the fatherland theoretical nonsense and a
practical absurdity. The big sharks are fighting each other to gobble
up other peoples’ “fatherlands”. The Manifesto draws the inevitable
conclusions from undisputed historical facts: the war “cannot be
justified on the slightest pretext of its being in the interest of the
people”; it is being prepared “for the sake of the capitalists’
profits and the ambitions of dynasties”. It would be a “crime” for the
workers to “shoot each other down”. That is what the Manifesto says.


The epoch of capitalist imperialism is one of ripe and rotten-ripe
capitalism, which is about to collapse, and which is mature enough to make
way for socialism. The period between 1789 and 1871 was one of progressive
capitalism when the overthrow of feudalism and absolutism, and liberation
from the foreign yoke were on history’s agenda. “Defence of the fatherland”,
i.e., defence against oppression, was permissible on these grounds, and
on these alone. The term would be applicable even now in a war against
the imperialist Great Powers, but it would be absurd to apply it to a war
between the imperialist Great Powers, a war to decide who gets the
biggest piece of the Balkan countries, Asia Minor, etc. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the “socialists” who advocate “defence of the fatherland”
in the present war shun the Basle Manifesto as a thief shuns the scene
of his crime. For the Manifesto proves them to be social-chauvinists, i.e.,
socialists in words, but chauvinists in deeds, who are helping “their own”
bourgeoisie to rob other countries and enslave other nations. That is the

    

very substance of chauvinism—to defend one’s “own” fatherland even when
its acts are aimed at enslaving other peoples’ fatherlands.


Recognition that a war is being fought for national liberation implies
one set of tactics; its recognition as an imperialist war, another.
The Manifesto clearly points to the latter. The war, it says, “will
bring on an economic and political crisis”, which must be “utilised”,
not to lessen the crisis, not to defend the fatherland, but, on the
contrary, to “rouse” the masses and “hasten the downfall of
capitalist rule”.  It is impossible to hasten something for which
historical conditions are not yet mature. The Manifesto declares that
social revolution is possible, that the conditions for it
have matured, and that it will break out precisely in
connection with war. Referring to the examples of the
Paris Commune and the Revolution of 1905 in Russia, i.e.,
examples of mass strikes and of civil war, the Manifesto declares that
“the ruling classes” fear “a proletarian revolution”. It is sheer
falsehood to claim, as Kautsky does, that the socialist attitude to
the present war has not been defined. This question was not
merely discussed, but decided in Basle, where the tactics of
revolutionary proletarian mass struggle were recognised.


It is downright hypocrisy to ignore the Basle Manifesto altogether, or
in its most essential parts, and to quote instead the speeches of
leaders, or the resolutions of various parties, which, in the first
place, antedate the Basle Congress, secondly, were not
decisions adopted by the parties of the whole world, and thirdly,
applied to various possible wars, but never to the present
war. The point is that the epoch of national wars between the big
European powers has been superseded by an epoch of imperialist wars
between them, and that the Basle Manifesto had to recognise this fact
officially for the first time.


It would be a mistake to regard the Basle Manifesto as an empty
threat, a collection of platitudes, as so much hot air. Those whom the
Manifesto exposes would like to have it that way. But it is not
true. The Manifesto is but the fruit of the great propaganda work
carried on throughout the entire epoch of the Second International; it
is but the summary of all that the socialists had disseminated among

    

the masses in the hundreds of thousands of speeches, articles and
manifestos in all languages. It merely reiterates what Jules
Guesde, for example, wrote in 1899, when he castigated
socialist ministerialism in the event of war: he wrote of war provoked
by the “capitalist pirates” (En Garde!, p. 175); it merely
repeats what Kautsky wrote in 1909 in his Road to
Power, where he admitted that the “peaceful” epoch was over and
that the epoch of wars and revolutions was on. To represent the Basle
Manifesto as so much talk, or as a mistake, is to regard as mere talk,
or as a mistake, everything the socialists have done in the last
twenty-five years. The opportunists and the Kautskyites find the
contradiction between the Manifesto and its non-application so
intolerable because it lays bare the profound contradictions in the
work of the Second International. The relatively “peaceful” character
of the period between 1871 and 1914 served to foster opportunism first
as a mood, then as a trend, until finally it formed
a group or stratum among the labour bureaucracy and
petty-bourgeois fellow-travellers. These elements were able to gain
control of the labour movement only by paying lip-service to
revolutionary aims and revolutionary tactics. They were able to win
the confidence of the masses only by their protestations that all this
“peaceful” work served to prepare the proletarian
revolution. This contradiction was a boil which just had to burst, and
burst it has. Here is the question: is it worth trying, as Kautsky and
Co. are doing, to force the pus back into the body for the sake of
“unity” (with the pus), or should the pus be removed as quickly and as
thoroughly as possible, regardless of the pang of pain caused by the
process, to help bring about the complete recovery of the body of the
labour movement?


Those who voted for war credits, entered cabinets and advocated
defence of the fatherland in 1914–15 have patently betrayed socialism.
Only hypocrites will deny it. This betrayal must be explained.

II

It would be absurd to regard the whole question
as one of personalities. What has opportunism to do with
it when men
like Plekhanov and Guesde, etc.?—asks Kautsky
(Die
Neue Zeit, May 28, 1915). What has opportunism to do with 

    

it
when Kautsky, etc.?—replies Axelrod on behalf of the
opportunists of the Quadruple Alliance (Die Krise der
Sozialdemokratie, Zurich, 1915, p. 21).  This is a complete
farce. If the crisis of the whole movement is to be explained, an
examination must be made, firstly, of the economic significance of the
present policy; secondly, its underlying ideas; and thirdly, its
connection with the history of the various trends in the socialist
movement.


What is the economic substance of
defencism
in the war of 1914–15?  The bourgeoisie of all the
big powers are waging the war to divide and exploit the
world, and oppress other nations. A few crumbs of the
bourgeoisie’s huge profits may come the way of the small
group of labour bureaucrats, labour aristocrats, and
petty-bourgeois fellow-travellers. Social-chauvinism and
opportunism have the same class basis, namely, the alliance
of a small section of privileged workers with “their”
national bourgeoisie against the working-class
masses; the alliance between the lackeys of the bourgeoisie
and the bourgeoisie against the class the latter is
exploiting.


Opportunism and social-chauvinism have the same political
content, namely, class collaboration, repudiation of the
dictatorship of the proletariat, repudiation of revolutionary action,
unconditional acceptance of bourgeois legality, confidence in the
bourgeoisie and lack of confidence in the proletariat.
Social-chauvinism is the direct continuation and consummation of
British liberal-labour politics, of Millerandism
and
Bernsteinism.[9]


The struggle between the two main trends in the labour movement—revolutionary 
socialism and opportunist socialism—fills the
entire period from 1889 to 1914. Even today there are two main trends
on the attitude to war in every country. Let us drop the bourgeois and
opportunist habit of referring to personalities. Let us take the
trends in a number of countries. Let us take ten European
countries: Germany, Britain, Russia, Italy, Holland, Sweden, Bulgaria,
Switzerland, Belgium and France. In the first eight the division into
opportunist and revolutionary trends corresponds to the division into
social-chauvinists and internationalists. In Germany the strongholds
of social-chauvinism are Sozialistische
Monatshefte [10] and Legien and Co.; in

    

Britain the
Fabians [11]
and the Labour
Party [12] (the
I.L.P. [13] has
always been allied with them and has supported their organ, and in
this bloc it has always been weaker than the social-chauvinists,
whereas three-sevenths of the
B.S.P. [14] are
internationalists); in Russia this trend is represented by Nasha
Zarya [15] (now Nashe Dyelo), by the Organising
Committee,[16] and by the Duma group led by Chkheidze; in Italy it is
represented by the reformists with Bissolati at their head; in
Holland, by Troelstra’s party; in Sweden, by the majority of the Party
led by Branting; in Bulgaria, by the so-called
“Shiroki”[17] socialists;
in Switzerland by Greulich and Co. In all these countries it
is the revolutionary Social-Democrats who have voiced a more or less
vigorous protest against social-chauvinism.  France and Belgium are
the two exceptions; there internationalism also exists, but is very
weak.


Social-chauvinism is opportunism in its finished form. It is quite
ripe for an open, frequently vulgar, alliance with the bourgeoisie and
the general staffs. It is this alliance that gives it great power and a
monopoly of the legal press and of deceiving the masses. It is absurd
to go on regarding opportunism as an inner-party phenomenon. It is
ridiculous to think of carrying out the Basle resolution together with
David, Legien, Hyndman, Plekhanov and Webb. Unity with the social-chauvinists
means unity with one’s “own” national bourgeoisie, which exploits other
nations; it means splitting the international proletariat. This does not
mean that an immediate break with the opportunists is possible everywhere;
it means only that historically this break is imminent; that it is necessary
and inevitable for the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat; that
history, which has led us from “peaceful” capitalism to imperialist capitalism,
has paved the way for this break. Volentem ducunt fata, nolentem
trahunt.[2]

III

This is very well understood by the shrewd
representatives of the bourgeoisie. That is why they are so lavish in
their praise of the present socialist parties, headed by the
“defenders

    

of the fatherland”, i.e., the defenders of imperialist
plunder. That is why the social-chauvinist leaders are rewarded by
their governments either with ministerial posts (in France and
Britain), or with a monopoly of unhindered legal existence (in Germany
and Russia). That is why in Germany, where the Social-Democratic Party
was strongest and where its transformation into a national-liberal
counter-revolutionary labour party has been most obvious, things have
got to the stage where the public prosecutor qualifies the struggle
between the “minority” and the “majority” as “incitement to class
hatred”! That is why the greatest concern of the clever opportunists
is to retain the former “unity” of the old parties, which did the
bourgeoisie so many good turns in 1914 and 1915. The views held by
these opportunists in all countries of the world were expounded with
commendable frankness by a German Social-Democrat in an article signed
“Monitor” which appeared in April 1915, in the reactionary magazine Preussische
Jahrbücher.[18] Monitor thinks that it would be very dangerous
for the bourgeoisie if the Social-Democrats were to move still
further to the right. “It must preserve its character as a labour
party with socialist ideals; for the day it gives this up a new party
will arise and adopt the programme the old party had disavowed, giving
it a still more radical formulation” (Preussische Jahrbücher,
1915, No.4, pp. 50–51).


Monitor hit the nail on the head. That is just
what the British Liberals and the French Radicals have always
wanted—phrases with a revolutionary ring to deceive the masses
and induce them to place their trust in the Lloyd Georges, the
Sembats, the Renaudels, the Legiens, and the Kautskys, in the men
capable of preaching “defence of the fatherland” in a predatory
war.


But Monitor represents only one variety of opportunism, the
frank, crude, cynical variety. Others act with stealth, subtlety, and
“honesty”. Engels once said that for the working class “honest”
opportunists were the greatest
danger.[19] Here is one example.


Kautsky wrote in Die Neue Zeit (November 26, 1915)
as follows: “The opposition against the majority is growing; the masses
are in an opposition mood. . . . After the war [only after the
war?—N. L.] class antagonisms will become

    

so sharp that radicalism will gain
the upper hand among the masses. . . . After the war [only after the
war?—N. L.] we shall be menaced with the desertion of the
radical elements
from the Party and their influx into the party of anti-parliamentary [??
meaning extra-parliamentary] mass action. . . . Thus, our Party is splitting
up into two extreme camps which have nothing in common.” To preserve unity,
Kautsky tries to persuade the majority in the Reichstag to allow the minority
to make a few radical parliamentary speeches. That means Kautsky wants
to use a few radical parliamentary speeches to reconcile the revolutionary
masses with the opportunists, who have “nothing in common” with revolution,
who have long had the leadership of the trade unions, and now, relying
on their close alliance with the bourgeoisie and the government, have also
captured the leadership of the Party. What essential difference is there
between this and Monitor’s “programme”? There is none, save for the sugary
phrases which prostitute Marxism.


At a meeting of the Reichstag group on March 18, 1915, Wurm,
a Kautskyite, “warned” against “pulling the strings too taut. There is
growing opposition among the workers’ masses to the majority of the
group, we must keep to the Marxist [?! probably a misprint: this
should read “the Monitor”] Centre” (Klassenkampf gegen den Krieg!
Material zum Fall Liebknecht.  Als Manuskript
gedruckt,[3]

p. 67.) Thus we
find that the revolutionary sentiment of the masses was
admitted as a fact on behalf of all the Kautskyites
(the so-called Centre) as early as March, 1915!! But eight
and a half months later, Kautsky again comes forward with the proposal
to “reconcile” the militant masses with the opportunist,
counter-revolutionary party—and he wants to do this with a few
revolutionary-sounding phrases!!


War is often useful in exposing what is rotten and discarding
the conventionalities.


Let us compare the British Fabians with the German Kautskyites.  Here
is what a real Marxist, Frederick Engels, wrote about the
former on January 18, 1893: “. . . a band of careerists who have
understanding enough to realise the inevitability

    

of the social
revolution, but who could not possibly entrust this gigantic task to
the raw proletariat alone. . . .  Fear of the revolution is their
fundamental principle” (Letters
to Sorge,
p. 390).[20]


And on November 11, 1893, he wrote: “. . . these haughty bourgeois who
kindly condescend to emancipate the proletariat from above if only it
would have sense enough to realise that such a raw, uneducated mass
cannot liberate itself and can achieve nothing without the kindness of
these clever lawyers, writers and sentimental old women” (ibid.,
p. 401).[21]


In theory Kautsky looks down upon the Fabians with the contempt
of a Pharisee for a poor sinner, for he swears by “Marxism”. But what
actual difference is there between the two? Both signed the Basle
Manifesto, and both treated it as Wilhelm II treated Belgian neutrality.
But Marx all his life castigated those who strove to quench the revolutionary
spirit of the workers.


Kautsky has put forward his new theory of “ultra-imperialism”
in opposition to the revolutionary Marxists. By this he means that the
“rivalries of national finance capitals” are to be superseded by the “joint
exploitation of the world by international finance capital” (Die Neue
Zeit, April 30, 1915). But he adds: “We do not as yet have sufficient
data to decide whether this new phase of capitalism is possible.” On the
grounds of the mere assumption of a “new phase”, which he does not even
dare declare definitely “possible”, the inventor of this “phase” rejects
his own revolutionary declarations as well as the revolutionary tasks and
revolutionary tactics of the proletariat—rejects them now, in
the “phase” of a crisis, which has already broken out, the phase
of war and the unprecedented aggravation of class antagonisms! Is this
not Fabianism at its most abominable?


Axelrod,
the leader of the Russian Kautskyites, says, “The centre of gravity of
the problem of internationalising the proletarian movement for
emancipation is the internationalisation of everyday practice”; for
example, “labour protection and insurance legislation must become the
object of the workers’ international organisation and action”
(Axelrod, The Crisis of Social-Democracy, Zurich, 1915,
pp. 39–40). Not only Legien, David and the Webbs, but even

    

Lloyd George
himself, and Naumann, Briand and Milyukov would quite obviously
subscribe to such “internationalism”.  As in 1912, Axelrod is quite
prepared to utter the most revolutionary phrases for the very distant
future, if the future International “comes out [against the
governments in the event of war] and raises a revolutionary storm”.
How brave we are! But when it comes to supporting and developing the
incipient revolutionary ferment among the masses now, Axelrod
says that these tactics of revolutionary mass action “would be
justified to some extent if we were on the very eve of the social
revolution, as was the case in Russia, for example, where the student
demonstrations of 1901 heralded the approaching decisive battles
against absolutism”. At the present moment, however, all that is
“utopia”, “Bakuninism”, etc. This is fully in the spirit of Kolb,
David, Südekum and Legien.


What dear old Axelrod forgets is that in 1901 nobody in Russia
knew, or could have known, that the first “decisive battle” would take
place four years later—please note, four years later—and that
it would be “indecisive”. Nevertheless, we revolutionary Marxists
alone were right at that time: we ridiculed the Krichevskys and Martynovs,
who called for an immediate assault. We merely advised the workers to kick
out the opportunists everywhere and to exert every effort to support, sharpen
and extend the demonstrations and other mass revolutionary action. The
present situation in Europe is absolutely similar. It would be absurd to
call for an “immediate” assault; but it would be a shame to call oneself
a Social-Democrat and not to advise the workers to break with the opportunists
and exert all their efforts to strengthen, deepen, extend and sharpen the
incipient revolutionary movement and demonstrations. Revolution never falls
ready-made from the skies, and when revolutionary ferment starts no one
can say whether and when it will lead to a “real”, “genuine” revolution.
Kautsky and Axelrod are giving the workers old, shop-worn, counter-revolutionary
advice. Kautsky and Axelrod are feeding the masses with hopes that the
future International will surely be revolutionary, but they are
doing this for the sole purpose of protecting, camouflaging and prettifying
the present domination of the counter-revolutionary elements—the

    

Legiens, Davids, Vanderveldes and Hyndmans. Is it not obvious that “unity”
with Legien and Co. is the best means of preparing the “future” revolutionary
International?


“It would be folly to strive to convert the world war into civil war,” declares David, the leader of the German opportunists (Die
Sozialdemokratie und der Weltkrieg, 1915, p. 172), in reply to the
manifesto of the Central Committee of our Party, November 1, 1914. This
manifesto says, inter alia:


“However difficult that transformation may seem at any given moment,
socialists will never relinquish systematic, persistent and undeviating
preparatory work in this direction now that war has become a
fact.”[4]


(This passage is also quoted by David, p. 171.) A month before David’s
book appeared our Party published its resolutions defining “systematic
preparation” as follows:

(1) refusal to vote for credits; (2) disruption of the class
truce; (3) formation
of illegal organisations; (4) support for solidarity manifestations in the
trenches; (5) support for all revolutionary mass
action.[5]


David is almost as brave as Axelrod. In 1912, he did not think that reference
to the Paris Commune in anticipation of the war was “folly”.


Plekhanov, a typical representative of the Entente social-chauvinists,
takes the same view of revolutionary tactics as David. He calls them a
“farcical dream”. But listen to Kolb, an avowed opportunist, who
wrote: “The consequence of the tactics of Liebknecht’s followers would
be that the struggle within the German nation would be brought up to boiling
point” (Die Sozialdemokratie am Scheidewege, p. 50).


But what is a struggle brought up to boiling point if not civil
war?


If our Central Committee’s tactics, which broadly coincide with
those of the Zimmerwald
Left,[22] were “folly”, “dreams”,
“adventurism”, “Bakuninism”—as David, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Kautsky and others
have asserted—they

    

could never lead to a “struggle within a nation”, let
alone to a struggle brought up to boiling point. Nowhere in the world have
anarchist phrases brought about a struggle within a nation. But the facts
indicate that precisely in 1915, as a result of the crisis produced by
the war, revolutionary ferment among the masses is on the increase, and
there is a spread of strikes and political demonstrations in Russia, strikes
in Italy and in Britain, and hunger demonstrations and political demonstrations
in Germany. Are these not the beginnings of revolutionary mass struggles?


The sum and substance of Social-Democracy’s practical programme
in this war is to support, develop, extend and sharpen mass revolutionary
action, and to set up illegal organisations, for without them there
is no way of telling the truth to the masses of people even in the “free”
countries. The rest is either lies or mere verbiage, whatever its trappings
of opportunist or



pacifist
theory.[6]


When we are told that these “Russian tactics” (David’s expression)
are not suitable for Europe, we usually reply by pointing to the facts.
On October 30, a delegation of Berlin women comrades called on the Party’s
Presidium in Berlin, and stated that “now that we have a large organising
apparatus it is much easier to distribute illegal pamphlets and leaflets
and to organise ‘banned meetings’ than it was under the Anti-Socialist
Law. . . . Ways and means are not lacking, but the will evidently is” (Berner
Tagwacht,[23] 1915, No. 271).


Had these bad comrades been led astray by the Russian “sectarians”,
etc.? Is it these comrades who represent the real masses, or is
it Legien and Kautsky? Legien, who in his report on January 27, 1915, fumed
against the “anarchistic” idea of forming underground organisations; or
Kautsky,

    

who has become such a counter-revolutionary that on November 26,
four days before the 10,000-strong demonstration in Berlin, he denounced
street demonstrations as “adventurism”!!


We’ve had enough of empty talk, and of prostituted “Marxism”
à la Kautsky! After twenty-five years of the Second
International,
after the Basle Manifesto, the workers will no longer believe fine words.
Opportunism is rotten-ripe; it has been transformed into social-chauvinism
and has definitely deserted to the bourgeois camp. It has severed its spiritual
and political ties with Social-Democracy. It will also break off its organisational
ties. The workers are already demanding “illegal” pamphlets and “banned”
meetings, i.e., underground organisations to support the revolutionary
mass movement. Only when “war against war” is conducted on these lines
does it cease to be empty talk and becomes Social-Democratic work. In spite
of all difficulties, setbacks, mistakes, delusions and interruptions, this
work will lead humanity to the victorious proletarian revolution.

At the International Women’s Congress held in Berne in March 1915, the

rejected. The British women laughed at this proposal and praised British
“liberty”. But a few months later British newspapers, like the Labour
Leader,[24] reached us with blank spaces, and then came the news of
police raids, confiscation of pamphlets, arrests, and Draconian sentences
imposed on comrades who had spoken in Britain about peace, nothing but
peace!—Lenin

An opportunist trend in German and international Social-Democracy hostile to Marxism. It emerged in Germany at the end of the 19th century, and got its name from Eduard Bernstein, a German Social-Democrat, who tried to revise Marx’s revolutionary theory on the lines of bourgeois liberalism. Among his supporters in Russia were the legal Marxists, the Economists, the Bund and the Mensheviks.

Members of the Fabian Society, a British reformist organisation founded in 1884; it got its name from the Roman commander, Fabius Maximus (d. 203 B.C.), surnamed Cunctator, that is, the delayer, for his tactics of harassing Hannibal’s army without risking a pitched battle. Most of the Society’s members were bourgeois intellectuals: scholars, writers, politicians (such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Bernard Shaw, Ramsay MacDonald, etc.); they denied the need for the class struggle of the proletariat and a socialist revolution, and insisted that the transition from capitalism to socialism lay only through petty reform and a gradual transformation of society. Lenin said it was “an extremely opportunist trend” (see LCW, Vol. 13, p. 358.) In 1900, the Fabian Society was affiliated to the Labour Party. Fabian socialism is one of the ideological sources of the Labour Party policy.

During the First World War, the Fabians took a social-chauvinist stand. For Lenin’s description of the Fabians, see “British Pacifism and the British Dislike of Theory” (LCW, Vol. 21).





[12]
Founded in 1900 as an amalgamation of trade unions, socialist organisations and groups to seat workers’s representatives in Parliament (Committee for Labour Representation). In 1906, it took the name of Labour Party. Trade-unionists are automatically members of the Party provided they pay membership dues. It is headed by an Executive Committee which together with the Trade Union General Council and the Executive Committee of the Co-operative Party constitute the so-called National Labour Council. The Co-operative Party and the I.L.P. are corporate members of the Labour Party.
Initially a working men’s party (it was subsequently joined by considerable numbers of petty-bourgeois elements), the Labour Party is opportunist in ideology and tactics. Since its emergence its leaders have been conducting a policy of class collaboration with the bourgeoisie. “The Labour Party is an out-and-out bourgeois party, for although it does consist of workers it is led by reactionaries—the worst reactionaries who operate in the spirit of the bourgeoisie. . . .” (See LCW, Vol. 31, “Speech on the Membership in the British Labour Party, Delivered on August 6, 1920, at the Second Congress of the Communist International”.) During the First World War, its leaders took a social-chauvinist stand.
Labour Governments (1924, 1929, 1945 and 1950) have conducted the policy of British imperialism. Dissatisfaction with the leadership’s policy among the British working people has led to a Left-wing trend in the Party opposing the leadership’s official policy.




[13]
The Independent Labour Party (I.L.P.) is a reformist organisation founded by the leaders of the “new trade unions” in 1893, during the upswing in the strike movement and the working-class movement for independence from the bourgeois parties. The I.L.P. included members of the “new trade unions” and a number of old ones, and also intellectuals and petty-bourgeois elements influenced by the Fabians. The Party was headed by Keir Hardie. From the outset it took a bourgeois-reformist stand, concentrating on the parliamentary forms of struggle and parliamentary deals with the Liberal Party. Lenin said it was “in practice an opportunist party which has always depended on the bourgeoisie” (see LCW, Vol. 29, “The Tasks of the Third International”).
At the outbreak of the First World War, the I.L.P. issued an anti-war manifesto, but soon slid down to social-chauvinist positions.




[14]
The British Socialist Party was founded in Manchester in 1911 by a merger of the Social-Democratic Party with other socialist groups. It spread Marxist ideas and was a party that was “not opportunist and was really independent of the Liberals” (see LCW, Vol. 19, p. 273.) But its small membership and weak ties with the masses lent it a somewhat sectarian character. During the First World War, a struggle broke out within it between the internationalist trend (William Gallacher, Albert Inkpin, John Maclean, Theodore Rothstein, and others) and the social-chauvinist trend led by Hyndman. Some in the internationalist trend took a Centrist stand on a number of issues. In February 1916, a group of B.S.P. members founded The Call, a newspaper which played a great part in rallying the internationalists. The B.S.P. annual conference at Salford in April 1916 condemned the social-chauvinist stand of Hyndman and his supporters, and they left the Party.
The B.S.P. welcomed the Great October Socialist Revolution. Its members took a leading part in the British working people’s movement in defense of Soviet Russia against foreign intervention. In 1919, the majority of its local organisations (98 against 4) voted in favour of joining the Communist International. Together with the Communist Unity Group, the B.S.P. played the decisive role in founding the Communist Party of Great Britain. At the first unity congress held in 1920, the overwhelming majority of local B.S.P. organisations joined the Communist Party.

Nasha Zarya (Our Dawn)—a legal monthly of the Menshevik liquidators published in Petersburg from January 1910 to September 1914. It was the liquidators’ centre in Russia. With the outbreak of the First World War the journal took a social-chauvinist stand.

Organising Committee (O.C.)—the Mensheviks’ governing centre, formed at the August conference of Menshevik liquidators and all anti-Party groups and trends in 1912.

The Zimmerwald Left was formed by Lenin at the first socialist conference of internationalists at Zimmerwald, Switzerland, in early September 1915; it was, Lenin said, the first step in the development of the internationalist movement against the war. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, were the only group within the Zimmerwald Left to take a consistently correct stand. The group also included a number of inconsistent internationalists, whose mistakes Lenin criticised in “The Junius Pamphlet”, and “The Discussion of Self-Determination Summed Up” (see pp. 305–19, 320–60 of this volume).




[24]
A weekly founded in 1891. From 1893 it was an organ of the I.L.P.; from 1922, it was called the New Leader, and since 1946 it has been known as the Socialist Leader.

Berner Tagwacht (Berne Reveille)—the organ of the Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland, published in Berne from 1893. In 1909–18, it was edited by R. Grimm. At the outbreak of the First World War, it carried articles by Liebknecht, Mehring and other Left-wing Social-Democrats. From 1917 the newspaper gave open support to the social-chauvinists. The paper’s present stand on the key domestic and foreign policy issues coincides with that of bourgeois newspapers.

Comrades!  The European war has been raging for
more than eighteen months. And as each month, as each day of the
war goes by, it becomes clearer and clearer to the masses of the
workers that the Zimmerwald
=

Manifesto[2] expressed the truth when it declared that phrases
about “defence of the fatherland” and the like are nothing but
capitalist deception. It is becoming more evident every day that
this is a war between capitalists, between big robbers,
who are quarrelling over the loot, each striving to obtain the
largest share, the largest number of countries to plunder, and
the largest number of nations to suppress and enslave.


It may sound incredible, especially to Swiss comrades, but it is
nevertheless true that in Russia, also, not only bloody tsarism,
not only the capitalists, but also a section of the so-called or
ex-Socialists say that Russia is fighting a “war of defence,”
that Russia is only fighting against German invasion. The whole
world knows, however, that for decades tsarism has been
oppressing more than a hundred million people belonging to other
nationalities in Russia; that for decades Russia has been
pursuing a predatory policy towards China, Persia, Armenia and
Galicia. Neither Russia, nor Germany, nor any other Great
Power has the right to claim that it is waging a “war of
defence”; all the Great Powers are waging an imperialist,
capitalist war, a predatory war, a war for the oppression of
small and foreign nations, a war for the sake of the profits of
the capitalists, who are coining golden profits amounting to
billions out of the appalling sufferings of the masses, out of
the blood of the proletariat.



 

Four years ago, in November 1912, when it had become clear that
war was approaching, the representatives of the Socialist
Parties of the whole world gathered at the International
Socialist Congress in Basle. Even at
that time there was no room for doubt that the impending war
would be a war between the Great Powers, between the great
beasts of prey; that responsibility for the war would rest upon
the governments and the capitalist classes of all the
Great Powers. The Basle Manifesto, which was adopted unanimously
by the Socialist Parties of the whole world, openly stated this
truth. The Basle Manifesto does not say a word about a “war
of defence,” or “defence of the fatherland.” It castigates
the governments and the bourgeoisie of all the Great Powers
without exception. It said openly that war would be the greatest
of crimes, that the workers would consider it a crime to shoot
at each other, that the horrors of war and the indignation these
would rouse among the workers would inevitably lead to a
proletarian revolution.


When the war actually broke out it was realised that its
character had been correctly defined at Basle. But the Socialist
and labour organisations were not unanimous in carrying out the
Basle decisions; they split. We see now that in all countries of
the world the Socialist and labour organisations are split into
two big camps. The smaller section, the leaders, functionaries
and officials, have betrayed Socialism and have deserted to the
side of the governments. Another section, to which the mass of
class conscious workers belong, continues to gather its forces,
to fight against the war and for the proletarian revolution.


The views of this latter section also found expression in the
Zimmerwald Manifesto.


In Russia, from the very beginning of the war, the workers’
deputies in the Duma waged a determined revolutionary
struggle against the war and the tsarist monarchy. Five workers’
deputies—Petrovsky, Badayev, Muranov, Shagov and
Samoilov—distributed revolutionary manifestoes against the
war and energetically carried on revolutionary
agitation. Tsarism ordered the arrest of those five deputies,
put them on trial, and sentenced them to lifelong exile in
Siberia. For months the leaders of the working class of Russia
have been pining in Siberia; but their cause has not gone

    

under;
their work is being continued by the class-conscious workers all
over Russia.


Comrades! You have heard the speeches of representatives of
various countries, who have told you about the workers’
revolutionary struggle against the war. I merely want to quote
one other example from that great and rich country, the United
States of America. The capitalists of that country are now
making enormous profits out of the European war. And they, too,
are agitating for war. They say that America must also prepare
to take part in the war, hundreds of millions of dollars must be
squeezed out of the people for new armaments, for armaments
without end. And in America, too, a section of the Socialists
echoes this false, criminal call. Let me read to you what
Comrade Eugene Debs, the most popular leader of the American
Socialists, the Presidential candidate of the American Socialist
Party, writes.


In the September 11, 1915, American weekly, The
Appeal to
Reason,[3]


September 11, 1915, he says:

“I am not a capitalist soldier; I am a proletarian
revolutionist. I do not belong to the regular army of rite
plutocracy, but to the irregular army of the people. I refuse to
obey any command to fight for the ruling class.... I am opposed
to every war but one; I am for that war with heart and soul, and
that is the world-wide war of the social revolution. In that war
I am prepared to fight in any way the ruling class may make it
necessary....”


This is what Eugene
Debs, the American Bebel,
the beloved leader of the American workers, writes to them.


This again shows you, comrades, that in all countries of the
world real preparations are being made to rally the forces of
the working class. The horrors of war and the sufferings of
the people are incredible. But we must not, and we have no
reason whatever, to view the future with despair.


The millions of victims who will fall in the war, and as a
consequence of the war, will not fall in vain. The millions who
are starving, the millions who are sacrificing their lives in
the trenches, are not only suffering, they are also gathering
strength, are pondering over the real cause of the war, are
becoming more determined and are acquiring a clearer
revolutionary understanding. Rising discontent of the masses,
growing ferment, strikes, demonstrations,

    

protests against the
war—all this is taking place in all countries of
the world. And this is the guarantee that the European War
will be followed by the proletarian revolution against
capitalism.

February 10, 1916

Dear Comrade,



Your deportation from France–which, incidentally, was noted with a
protest even in the chauvinist paper,
La Bataille,[2] which, however, did not care to tell the truth, namely,
that you were deported for sympathising with the opposition–has once
again recalled to my mind the burning question regarding the situation and
the tasks of the opposition in France.


I saw Bourderon and Merrheim in Zimmerwald. I heard their reports and
read about their work in the newspapers. I cannot in the least doubt their
sincerity and devotion to the cause of the proletariat. Nevertheless, it is
obvious that their tactics are mistaken. Both fear a split more than
anything else. Not a step, not a word that might lead to a split in the
Socialist Party or in the trade unions in France, that might lead to a
split in the Second International, to the creation of the Third
International–such is the slogan of both Bourderon and Merrheim.


Nevertheless, the split in the labour and Socialist movements throughout
the world is a fact. We have two irreconcilable working class tactics and
policies in relation to the war. It is ridiculous to close our eyes to this
fact. Any attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable will doom all our work to
futility. In Germany, even Deputy Otto Ruhle, a comrade of Liebknecht’s,
has openly admitted that a split in the Party is inevitable, because its
present majority, the official “leaders” of the German Party, have gone
over to the bourgeoisie. The arguments advanced against Ruhle and
against a split by the so-called representatives of the “centre” or “marsh”
(le marais) by Kautsky and the
Vorwärts,[3] are just lies and
hypocrisy, however “well-intentioned”

    

this hypocrisy may be. Kautsky and
the Vorwärts cannot and do not even attempt to deny that the
majority of the German Party is in fact carrying out the policy of the
bourgeoisie. Unity with such a majority is detrimental to the
working class. Such unity means subordinating the working class to the
bourgeoisie of “its own” nation; it means a split in the international
working class. Actually Ruhle is right when he says that there are two
parties in Germany. One, the official party, is carrying out the
policy of the bourgeoisie. The other, the minority, is publishing illegal
manifestoes, organising demonstrations, etc. We see the same thing all over
the world, and the impotent diplomats, or the “marsh,” such as Kautsky in
Germany, Longuet in France and Martov and Trotsky in Russia, are causing
the greatest harm to the labour movement by their insistence upon a
fictitious unity, thus hindering the now ripe and
imminent unification of the opposition in all countries and the
creation of the Third International. In England even a moderate paper like
the Labour
Leader publishes Russell Williams’ letters urging the necessity
for a split with the trade union “leaders” and with the Labour
Party, which he says, “sold out” the interests of the working class. A
number of members of the Independent Labour Party have declared in the
press that they sympathise with Russell Williams. In Russia, even Trotsky,
the “conciliator,” is now compelled to admit that a split is inevitable
with the “patriots,” i.e., the party of the “Organisation
Committee,” the O.C., who approve of workers participating in the War
Industries
Committees.[4] It is only false pride that compels Trotsky to continue
to defend “unity” with Chkheidze’s Duma fraction, which is the most
faithful friend, protector and defender of the “patriots” and the O.C.


Even in the United States of America there is actually a complete split.
Some Socialists in that country are for the army, for “preparedness,” for
war. Others, including the most popular leader of the workers, Eugene Debs,
the Socialist Party Presidential candidate, preach civil war against the
war of nations.


Look at what Bourderon and Merrheim are doing! In words they are opposed
to a split. But read the resolution which Bourderon moved at the Congress
of the French Socialist
Party.[5] This resolution demands the withdrawal of
the Socialists

    

from the Cabinet!! The resolution bluntly
“disapprover” of the C.A.P. and the G.P. (C.A.P=Com. Adm. Perm.,
G.P.= Gr.
Parlem.[1]

)!!!

It is as clear as daylight that
the adoption of such a resolution would cause a split in the Socialist
Party and in the trade unions, because Messrs. Renaudel, Sembat,
Jouhaux and Co. would never reconcile themselves to that.


Bourderon and Merrheim share the error, the weakness and the timidity of
the majority of the Zimmerwald Conference. On the one hand, in its
Manifesto this majority indirectly calls for
revolutionary struggle, but is afraid to do so openly. On the one
hand, it declares that the capitalists in all countries are lying
when they talk about “defending the fatherland” in the present war. On the
other hand, the majority was afraid to add the obvious truth which, in any
case, every thinking worker will add for himself that not only are
the capitalists lying, but so also are Renaudel, Sembat, Longuet,
Hyndman, Kautsky, Plekhanov and Co.! The majority of the Zimmerwald
Conference wants to become reconciled with Vandervelde, Huysmans, Renaudel
and Co. again. This is harmful to the working class, and the “Zimmerwald
Left” acted correctly when it openly told the workers the truth.


Look at the hypocrisy of the socialiste-chauvins: in France they praise
the German minority in Germany they praise the French!!


What enormous significance the action of the French opposition would
have if it straightforwardly, fearlessly, openly declared to the whole
world: We are in agreement only with the German opposition, only with
Ruhle and his associates!! Only with those who fearlessly sever all
connections with avowed and tacit social-chauvinism, socialism
chauvine, i.e., with all the “defenders of the fatherland” in the
present war!! We ourselves are not afraid to sever our
connections with the French “patriots” who call the defence of
colonies “defence of the fatherland,” and we call upon Socialists and
syndicalists in all countries to do the same!! We extend our
hand to Otto Ruhle and Liebknecht, only to them, and to
those who associate with them; and we denounce the French and the German
majorit\’eand “le marais.” We proclaim the great
international unity

    

of all those Socialists in all countries who in this
war repudiate the fraudulent phrase, “defence of the fatherland,” and who
are a fraud, and who engaged in preaching and preparing for the world
proletarian revolution!


Such an appeal would be of enormous importance. It would scatter the
hypocrites, expose and unmask international fraud, and would give a
tremendous impetus to the rapprochement of those workers the world over who
have really remained loyal to internationalism.


Anarchist phrase-mongering has always been very harmful in France. But
now the anarchist-patriots, the anarchist-chauvins, like Kropotkin,
Grave, Cornelissen and the other knights of La Bataille
Chauviniste will help to cure very many workers of anarchist
phrase-mongering. Down with the social-patriots and socialist-chauvins!
This call will find an echo in the hearts of the workers of France. Not
anarchist phrase-mongering about revolution, but sustained, earnest,
tenacious, persistent, systematic work of creating every where
illegal organisations among the workers, of spreading free, i.e.,
illegal literature, of preparing the movement of the masses against their
governments. This is what the working class of all countries needs!


It is untrue to say that “the French are incapable” of carrying on
systematic illegal work. Untrue! The French quickly learned to conceal
themselves in the trenches; they will quickly learn the new
conditions of illegal work and systematically to prepare for a
revolutionary mass movement. I believe in the French revolutionary
proletariat. It will also stimulate the French opposition.

With best wishes,

Yours,

Lenin


P.S. I suggest that the French comrades publish a
translation of this letter (full translation) as a special
=

leaflet.[6]

In their
magazine,[2]

and more definitely in their report to the
International Socialist
Committee[1]

(No. 2 of the Bulletin which appeared in German on
November 27,
1915[3]), the adherents of the O.C. attempt to assure the public
that the Chkheidze
fraction[4]
and the O.C.
have a policy of their own, which is completely internationalist and
differs from the policy of Nashe Dyelo. These assertions are most
flagrant untruths. In the first place, ever since the O.C. was formed
(August, 1912), we have witnessed for many years the most complete
political agreement on all fundamentals, and the closest political
cooperation, between the Chkheidze fraction and the O.C. and the Nasha
Zarya group; and only this group has carried on
systematic work among the masses (the liquidators’ daily papers). If there
are any real differences among such close “friends,” they must be proved,
not by words but by weighty facts. Not a single fact of this kind
can be brought forward, Secondly, for a number of years, from 1912
to 1914, the Chkheidze fraction and the O.C. have been pawns in the hands
of Nasha Zarya and have systematically defended its policy (a fact
very well known to the workers of St. Petersburg and other places) and
nor once did they exercise any influence in the direction of
changing the policy of Nasha Zarya,
Luch,[5]
etc.


In politics concerning the masses–for example, the struggle
against the “strike fever,” the election of leaders of the biggest trade
unions (metal workers and others) and of the most important insurance
organisations (the All-Russian Insurance Council)–Nasha
Zarya was the only group that acted independently, while the O.C. and
the Chkheidze
fraction merely assisted is serving faithfully and well. Thirdly, not a
single
    

fact has occurred in the course of the last eighteen months of
the war to prove that the long established relations of the Chkheidze
fraction and the O.C. with Nasha Zarya have undergone any change.
On the contrary, facts prove the opposite, and some may even be made public
(the majority of facts of this kind should not be made public). It is a
fact that in Russia neither the O.C. nor the Chkheidze fraction has ever,
not even once, opposed the policy of Nashe Dyelo; and yet
a real change in policy would require, not one protest, but a prolonged and
victorious struggle; for Nashe Dyelo is a political quantity
fostered by liberal connections, whereas the O.C. and the Chkheidze
fraction are merely political stage scenery. It is a fact that
Utro and Rabocheye
Utro,[6] which wholly and entirely pursue
the policy of Nashe Dyelo, even outwardly demonstrate their
political proximity to the Chkheidze fraction and speak in the name of the
entire August bloc. It is a fact that the Chkheidze fraction is collecting
funds for Rabecheye Utro. It is a fact that the whole of the
Chkheidze fraction is now writing for the Samara social-chauvinist paper
Nash Golos (see No. 17). It is a fact that one of the most
prominent members of the Chkheidze fraction, Chkhenkeli, has published in
the press, in the “defencist” or social-chauvinist magazine Sovremenny
=

Mir,[7] the magazine published by Messrs. Plekhanov and Alexinsky,
declarations of principles in line with those of Plekhanov, Nashe
Dyelo, Kautsky and Axelrod. We quoted Chkhenkeli’s declaration a long
time ago, and yet neither the adherents of the O.C, their magazine, nor
Trotsky in his Nashe
=

Slove[8] have dared to defend this declaration, although they defend
and advertise the Chkheidze fraction. Fourthly, direct political statements
in the name of the whole of the Chkheidze fraction and of the whole of the
O.C. prove our assertion. Take the most important pronouncements, which
have been reprinted in the O.C.’s magazine: the declaration of Chkheidze
and Co. and the manifesto of the O.C. The point of view of both these
documents is identical, the position they both take is the same.
Since the O.C. is the supreme leading body in the “August bloc” against our
Party, and since the O.C.’s manifesto was printed secretly, which means
that it was able to speak more freely and more openly than Chkheidze is
able to speak in the Duma, let us examine the O.C.’s manifesto.

 

It is interesting to note, by the way, that this manifesto has already
been the subject of controversy in the German Social-Democratic press, in
the Berne Social Democratic paper. A contributor to that newspaper
described the manifesto as “patriotic”. This roused the indignation of the
Foreign Secretariat of the O.C., which published a refutation declaring
that “we, too, the Foreign Secretariat, are guilty of such patriotism,” and
invited the editors of the paper to be the judges, as it were; for this
purpose it submitted to them a full German translation of the manifesto. We
must add that the editors of this paper are notoriously partial to the O.C.
and give it publicity. What did these editors, who are partial to the O.C.,
say?


“We have read a manifesto issued by the O.C.,” said the editors (No.
250), “and we must admit that the text may undoubtedly give rise to
misunderstanding and impart to the whole a meaning which was perhaps alien
to the authors of the manifesto.”


Why did not the adherents of the O.C. reprint in their magazine this
opinion of the editors, whom they themselves had invited to act as judges?
Because it is the opinion of the friends of the O.C. who publicly refused
to defend the O.C.! The opinion was written with exquisite diplomatic
courtesy, which makes it particularly evident that the editors desired to
say something “pleasant” to Axelrod and Martov. But the pleasantest thing
they could say is: “Perhaps” (only “perhaps”!) “the O.C. did not
say what it meant to say; but what it did say may undoubtedly give rise to
misunderstanding!!”


We strongly urge our readers to read the O.C.’s manifesto, which is
reproduced in the Bund’s Bulletin (No. 9). Anyone who reads it
carefully will note the following clear and simple facts: 1) the manifesto
does not contain a single statement which in principle repudiates national
defence in the present war; 2) there is absolutely nothing in the manifesto
which in principle would be inacceptable to the “defencists” or
social chauvinists; 3) there are a number of statements in the manifesto
which are completely identical with “defencism”: “The proletariat cannot
remain indifferent to the impending defeat” (almost literally what is said
in Rabocheye Utro, which says: “not indifferent” towards “saving
the country from defeat”); “the proletariat is vitally interested

    

in the
self preservation of the country”; “a popular revolution” must save the
country “from external defeat,” etc. Instead of using expressions
like these, one who is really hostile to racial chauvinism would have said
instead: The landowners, the tsar and the bourgeoisie are lying;
by national self-preservation they mean preserving the Great-Russian
oppression of Poland and retaining her by force; they are lying, their talk
about saving the “country” from defeat being designed to conceal their
desire to “save” the Great-Power privileges and divert the proletariat from
the tasks of fighting the international bourgeoisie. To admit in
one breath the need for the international solidarity of the proletariat of
the belligerent countries in this predatory imperialist war and the
permissibility of phrases about “saving” one of these countries from
“defeat” is sheer hypocrisy and signifies that one’s declarations are
nothing more than idle talk and false oratory. The implication there is
that the tactics of the proletariat depend on the military situation of a
given country at a given time; if that is the case the French
social-chauvinists would also be right in helping to “save” Austria or
Turkey from “defeat”.


The O.C. Secretariat Abroad writing in the German Social-Democratic
press (the Berne paper) has put forward yet another sophism which is so
shameless, so crude, and so deliberately “set” to catch the Germans in
particular, that the adherents of the O.C. wisely refrained from repeating
it before the Russian public


“If it is patriotism,” they write for the benefit of the
Germans in a tone of noble indignation, “to tell the proletariat that
revolution is the only means of saving the country from disaster”, then we,
too, are “patriots”, and “we wish the International had many more ‘patriots’
like this in every Socialist Party; we are sure that Liebknecht, Rosa
Luxemburg and Merrheim would be very glad to have many more ‘patriots’ like
these around them to appeal to the German and French workers with
manifestos of this kind”.


This is deliberate misrepresentation; the five secretaries know
perfectly well that there is not a hint of any bourgeois
revolutionary mood or any bourgeois social movement striving for
revolution for the sake of victory over the enemy either in France
or Germany, both of which are headed for socialist revolution; in Russia,
however, just because she

    

is headed for a bourgeois-democratic
revolution, such a movement does exist, as everybody knows. The
five secretaries are trying to deceive the Germans by an amusing sophism:
the O.C. and Chkheidze and Co. cannot be revolutionary chauvinists
in Russia, they argue, because in Europe a combination of revolutionism
with chauvinism is an absurdity!


Yes, in Europe it is an absurdity. In Russia, however, it is a fact. You
may reproach the
Prizyv[9] crowds for being bad bourgeois
revolutionaries, but you cannot deny that in their own way they combine
chauvinism with revolutionism. The July conference of the Narodniks in
=

Russia,[10] Nashe Dyelo and Rabocheye Utro wholly and
entirely take the position of the Prizyv-ists in this respect:
they, too, combine chauvinism with revolutionism.


The Chkheidze fraction, in its declaration (pp.141-43 of the O.C.’s
magazine) took up the same position. Chkheidze uses the same
chauvinist phrases about the “danger of defeat,” and if he admits
the imperialist character of the war, stands for “peace without
annexations,” “the general tasks of the entire international proletariat,”
“the struggle for peace,” etc., etc. so does Rabocheye Utro; and
so do the petty-bourgeois Russian Narodniks. In this very magazine of the
O.C., on page 146, we read that the petty-bourgeois Narodniks have admitted
the imperialist character of the war, have adopted the demand for “peace
without annexations” and have admitted that Socialists (the Narodniks as
well as the Rabocheye Utro wish to be known as Socialists) “must
strive for the speedy restoration of the international solidarity of the
Socialist organisations in order to stop the war,” etc. The petty-bourgeois
Narodniks resort to all these phrases to camouflage the slogan of “national
defence,” which they have openly advanced, whereas Chkheidze, the O.C, and
Rabocheye Utro pass off this slogan in the guise of “save the
country from defeat.”


The sum and substance of the whole thing is that Chkheidze and the O.C.
have poured out a string of revolutionary phrases, which commit them to
nothing and which in no way hinder the practical policies of the
Prizyv-ists and the Nashe Dyelo-ists, but they have
hushed up these policies. In one way or another they support
participation in the War Industries Committees.

 

Fewer phrases about revolution, gentlemen, and more clarity,
straightforwardness and honesty in the practical policies of today. You
promise to be revolutionaries, but just now you are helping the
chauvinists, the bourgeoisie and tsarism, either by openly advocating that
the workers be represented in the War Industries Committees, or by tacitly
defending those who participate in them by refraining from fighting
them.


Martov may wriggle as much as he likes. Trotsky may shout against our
factionalism, concealing with these shouts (an old trick of
Turgenev’s...
hero![11]) his own, no doubt non-factional, “expectations” that
someone in Chkheidze’s fraction is “in agreement” with him and swears that
he is a Left, an internationalist, etc. But facts remain facts. There is
no shadow of serious political difference not only between the
O.C. and the Chkheidze fraction, there is none even between these bodies
and Rabocheye Utro or Prizyv.


That is why in practice they are together in opposing our
party, in supporting the bourgeois policy of workers participating
in the War Industries Committees, and are together in siding with the
non-party workers and the Narodniks. The verbal reservations and vows of
the “foreign secretaries” that they “disagree” remain idle phrases, which
affect the real policy of the masses as little as the vows of Sudekum,
Legien and David that they are “for peace” and “against war” absolve them
of chauvinism.

The Berne resolution of
our Party declared:
“One of the means of fooling the working class is pacifism, the
preaching of peace in the abstract. At the present time, peace
propaganda unaccompanied by a call for revolutionary
mass action can only have the effect of spreading illusions and
demoralising the proletariat; for it serves to imbue the
proletariat with confidence in the humanitarianism of the
bourgeoisie and to convert it into a plaything in the hands of
the secret diplomacy of the belligerent countries.” (See
=

Sotsial-Demokrat[2] No. 40, and “Socialism and
War”).[1]


The opponents of our point of view on the question of peace, who
are numerous among Russian emigres, but not among the Russian
workers, have never taken the trouble to analyse these
propositions. Theoretically irrefutable, these propositions are
receiving striking and practical confirmation as a result of the
turn affairs have taken in our country.


As is well known, from its very first issue, Rabocheye
Utro, the organ of the St. Petersburg leaglist-Liquidators,
which is ideologically supported by the Organisation Committee,
adopted a social-chauvinist “defencist” position. It published
the “defencist” manifestoes of the St. Petersburg and Moscow
social-chauvinists. Both manifestoes, inter alia,
express the idea of “peace without annexations,” and No. 2 of
Rabocheye Utro, which particularly stresses that slogan
prints it in Italics and calls it “a line which provides the
country with a way out of the impasse.” It is calumny
to call us chauvinists, the paper seems to say; we fully accept
the most “democratic” even “truly socialist” slogan of “peace
without annexations.”

 

No doubt Nicholas the Bloody finds it to his advantage to have
such a slogan advanced by his loyal subjects at the present
time. Tsarism, basing itself on the landowners and the
bourgeoisie, led its armies to rob and enslave Galicia (not to
mention the treaty to carve up Turkey, etc.). The
armies of the no less predatory German imperialists repulsed the
Russian robbers and pushed them, not only out of Galicia, but
also out of “Russian Poland” (in this struggle for the interests
of both these cliques, hundreds of thousands of Russian and
German workers and peasants fell on the battlefield). The slogan
“peace without annexations” thus serves as an excellent
“plaything in the hands of the secret diplomacy” of tsarism; the
latter can now say: Look, we have been outraged; we have been
robbed, deprived of Poland; we are opposed to annexations!


How well the role of lackeys to tsarism “suits” the
social-chauvinists of Rabocheye Utro is particularly
evident from an article in the first issue of that paper,
entitled “Polish Emigration.” “The past months of the war,” we
read, “have engendered in the minds of broad strata of the
Polish people a deep striving towards independence.” Of course,
before the war there was no such thing!! “In the social
consciousness of broad strata of Polish democracy the mass”
[evidently this is a misprint; it ought to read “the idea, the
thought,” etc.] “of the national independence of Poland has
triumphed”.... “Before Russian democracy the Polish question
looms up importunately in all its magnitude....” “The Russian
liberals” refuse to give plain answers to the burning questions
“about Poland’s independence....”


Nicholas the Bloody, Khvostov, Chelnokov, Milyukov and Co. are,
of course, wholly in favour of the independence of
Poland—heart and soul in favour of it now, that,
in practice, this slogan means victory over
Germany, which deprived Russia of Poland. Let us not forget that
the creators of “Stolypin’s Labour
Party”[3] before the war,
were wholly and unreservedly opposed to the slogan of
self-determination of nations, opposed to Poland’s right of
secession, and that they put up the opportunist Semkovsky for
the noble purpose of defending tsarist oppression in Poland. Now
that Poland has been taken from Russia they are in
favour of the “independence” of Poland

    

(from Germany; but
about this they maintain a discreet silence).


You will not deceive the class-conscious workers of Russia,
Messrs. social-chauvinists! Your
“October” 1915[4] slogans of
independence of  Poland and peace without annexations are in
practice servility to tsarism, which precisely at the present
time, precisely in February 1916, deems it necessary to
camouflage its war with fine words
about “peace without annexations” (driving Hindenburg
out of Poland) and the independence of Poland (independent of
Wilhelm, but dependent upon Nicholas II).


A Russian Social-Democrat who has not forgotten his programme
argues differently. Russian democracy, he will say, having Great
Russian democracy in mind first of all and most of all, for it
alone has always enjoyed liberty of language in
Russia—Russian democracy has undoubtedly gained
from the fact that at present Russia does not oppress
Poland and does not hold it by force. The Russian proletariat
has undoubtedly gained-from the fact that it does not oppress
one of the peoples it helped to oppress yesterday. German
democracy has undoubtedly lost, for as long as the German
proletariat tolerates the oppression of Poland by Germany it
will remain in a position worse than that of a slave, in the
position of a servitor helping to keep others enslaved. The only
ones who have really gained are the Junkers and the bourgeoisie
of Germany.


Hence, Russian Social-Democrats must unmask the deception of the
people perpetrated by tsarism now that the slogans of “peace
without annexations” and “independence of Poland” are being
advanced in Russia; for in the present situation both these
slogans express the desire to continue the war and a
justification of this desire. We must say: No war for the sake
of recapturing Poland! The Russian people do not want to become
Poland’s oppressor again!


But how can we help liberate Poland from Germany! Is it not our
duty to help in this? Of course it is, but not by supporting the
imperialist war of tsarist, or of bourgeois, or even of
bourgeois republican Russia, but by supporting the revolutionary
proletariat
of Germany,  by  supporting  those  elements  in  the
Social-Democratic Party of Germany who are fighting against the
counter-revolutionary
    

labour party of Südekum, Kautsky
and Co. Kautsky very recently demonstrated his
counter-revolutionary nature in a most flagrant manner: on
November 26, 1915, he described street demonstrations as an
“adventurism” (just as Struve before January 9, 1905, declared
that there are no revolutionary people in Russia) and yet, on
November 30, 1915, ten thousand working women demonstrated in
Berlin!


All those who want to stand for the freedom of nations, for the
right of nations to self-determination, not
hypocritically, not in the Südekum, Plekhanov, Kautsky
fashion, but sincerely, must be opposed to the war because of
the oppression of Poland; they must be in favour of the
right of secession from Russia for those nations which Russia is
now, oppressing: the Ukraine, Finland, etc. Those who
do not wish to be social-chauvinists in deeds must support only
those elements in the Socialist Parties of all countries which
are frankly, directly and immediately working for the
proletarian revolution in their own countries.


Not “peace without annexations,” but peace to the cottages, war
on the palaces; peace to the proletariat and the toiling masses,
war on the bourgeoisie!

The pamphlet by the avowed
German opportunist, Wilhelm Kolb, entitled Social-Democracy at the
Cross-Roads (Karlsruhe, 1915), appeared opportunely after the
publication of Plekhanov’s symposium, War. The Kautskyist Rudolf
Hilferding wrote a very feeble reply to Kolb in the Neue Zeit, in
which he evaded the main issues and sniveled over Kolb’s correct
assertion that the unity of the German Social-Democrats was
“purely formal.”


Whoever wishes to ponder seriously over the significance of the
collapse of the Second International would do well to compare
Kolb’s ideological position with Plekhanov’s. Like Kautsky, both
agree on the fundamental issue: both reject and ridicule the
idea of revolutionary action in connection with the present war;
both accuse the revolutionary Social-Democrats of “defeatism,”
using the favourite expression of the Plekhanovists. Plekhanov,
who describes the idea of a revolution in connection with the
present war as a “dream-farce,” rails against “revolutionary
phraseology.” Kolb at every step curses “revolutionary phrases,”
the “revolutionary fantasies,” the “little radicals”
(“Radikalinski”) the “hystericals,” “sectarianism,” etc. Kolb
and Plekhanov agree on the main issue: both are opposed to
revolution. The fact that Kolb is generally opposed
to revolution, whereas Plekhanov and Kautsky are “generally in
favour,” is only a difference in shade, in words: in reality,
Plekhanov and Kautsky are Kolb’s satellites.


Kolb is more honest, not in a personal, but in a political
sense, that is, being consistent in his position, he is not a
hypocrite. Hence, he is not afraid to admit the truth that, from
his point of view, the entire International had been imbued

    

with
“the spirit of revolutionary fantasy,” that it had uttered
“threats” (threats of  revolution Messrs. Plekhanov and Kolb!)
in connection with the war. Kolb is right when he says that it
is ridiculous to “repudiate” capitalist society “in principle”
after the Social-Democratic Parties of Europe had risen in its
defence at the very moment when the capitalist state was
cracking from top to bottom, when “its very existence was in
question.” This admission of the objective revolutionary
situation is the truth.


“The consequence” (of the tactics of Liebknecht’s followers),
writes Kolb, “would be that the internal struggle within the
German nation would reach boiling point and this would weaken
its military and political power” ... to the advantage and victory
“of the imperialism of the Triple Entente”!!


Here you have the crux of the opportunist railing against
“defeatism.”  This is really the crux of the whole
question. “Internal struggle which has reached boiling point” is
civil war. Kolb is right when he says that the tactics of the
Left lead to this; he is right when he says that they mean the
“military weakening” of Germany, i.e., desiring and aiding its
defeat, defeatism. Kolb is wrong only—only!—in that he
refuses to see the international character of these tactics of
the Left. For “the internal struggle to reach boiling point,”
the “weakening of the military power” of the imperialist
bourgeoisie and (by virtue of this, in connection with it, by
means of it) the transformation of the imperialist war into
civil war are possible in all the belligerent countries. This is
the crux of the whole question. We thank Kolb for his good
wishes, admissions and illustrations; since all this comes from
an exceedingly consistent, honest and avowed enemy of the
revolution; it is particularly valuable as a means of exposing
to the workers the hideous hypocrisy and the shameful
spinelessness of the Plekhanovs and Kautskys.

1. Imperialism, Socialism, and the Liberation of Oppressed Nations


Imperialism is the highest
stage of development of capitalism. Capital in the advanced
countries has outgrown the boundaries of national states.  It has
established monopoly in place of competition, thus creating all
the objective prerequisites for the achievement of
socialism. Hence, in Western Europe and in the United States of
America, the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat for the
overthrow of the capitalist governments, for the expropriation of
the bourgeoisie, is on the order of the day. Imperialism is
forcing the masses into this struggle by sharpening class
antagonisms to an immense degree, by worsening the conditions of
the masses both economically—trusts and high cost of
living, and politically—growth of militarism, frequent wars,
increase of reaction, strengthening and extension of national
oppression and colonial plunder. Victorious socialism must achieve
complete democracy and, consequently, not only bring about the
complete equality of nations, but also give effect to the right of
oppressed nations to self-determination, i.e., the right to free
political secession. Socialist Parties which fail to prove by all
their activities now, as well as during the revolution and after
its victory, that they will free the enslaved nations and
establish relations with them on the basis of a free union and a
free union is a lying phrase without right to secession—such
parties would be committing treachery to socialism.

 


Of course, democracy is also a form of state which must
disappear when the state disappears, but this will take place
only in the process of transition from completely victorious and
consolidated socialism to complete communism.

2. The Socialist Revolution and the Struggle for Democracy


The socialist revolution is not one single act, not one single
battle on a single front; but a whole epoch of intensified class
conflicts, a long series of battles on all fronts, i.e., battles
around all the problems of economics and politics, which can
culminate only in the expropriation of the bourgeoisie. It would
be a fundamental mistake to suppose that the struggle for
democracy can divert the proletariat from the socialist
revolution, or obscure, or overshadow it, etc. On the contrary,
just as socialism cannot be victorious unless it introduces
complete democracy, so the proletariat will be unable to prepare
for victory over the bourgeoisie unless it wages a many-sided,
consistent and revolutionary struggle for democracy.


If would be no less mistaken to delete any of the points of the
democratic programme, for example, the point of
self-determination of nations, on the ground that it is
“infeasible,” or that it is “illusory” under imperialism.  The
assertion that the right of nations to self-determination cannot
be achieved within the framework of capitalism may be understood
either in its absolute, economic sense, or in the conventional,
political sense.


In the first case, the assertion is fundamentally wrong in
theory. First, in this sense, it is impossible to achieve such
things as labour money, or the abolition of crises, etc., under
capitalism. But it is entirely incorrect to argue that the
self-determination of nations is likewise infeasible.  Secondly,
even the one example of the secession of Norway from Sweden in
1905 is sufficient to refute the argument that it is
“infeasible” in this sense. Thirdly, it would be ridiculous to
deny that, with a slight change in political and strategical
relationships, for example, between Germany and England, the
formation of new states, Polish, Indian, etc, would be quite
“feasible” very soon. Fourthly, finance capital, in its striving
towards expansion, will “freely” buy and bribe the freest,

    

most
democratic and republican government and the elected officials
of any country, however “independent” it may be. The domination
of finance capital, as of capital in general, cannot be
abolished by any kind of reforms in the realm of political
democracy, and self-determination belongs wholly and exclusively
to this realm. The domination of finance capital, however, does
not in the least destroy the significance of political democracy
as the freer, wider and more distinct form of class oppression
and class struggle. Hence, all arguments about the
“impossibility of achieving” economically one of the demands of
political democracy under capitalism reduce themselves to a
theoretically incorrect definition of the general and
fundamental relations of capitalism and of political democracy
in general.


In the second case, this assertion is incomplete and inaccurate,
for not only the right of nations to self-determination, but all
the fundamental demands of political democracy are “possible of
achievement” under imperialism, only in an incomplete, in a
mutilated form and as a rare exception (for example, the
secession of Norway from Sweden in 1905). The demand for the
immediate liberation of the colonies, as advanced by all
revolutionary Social-Democrats, is also “impossible of
achievement” under capitalism without a series of
revolutions. This does not imply, however, that Social Democracy
must refrain from conducting an immediate and most determined
struggle for all these demands—to refrain would merely be
to the advantage of the bourgeoisie and reaction. On the
contrary, it implies that it is necessary to formulate and put
forward all these demands, not in a reformist, but in a
revolutionary way; not by keeping within the framework of
bourgeois legality, but by breaking through it; not by confining
oneself to parliamentary speeches and verbal protests, but by
drawing the masses into real action, by widening and fomenting
the struggle for every kind of fundamental, democratic demand,
right up to and including the direct onslaught of the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie, i.e., to the socialist
revolution, which will expropriate the bourgeoisie. The
socialist revolution may break out not only in consequence of a
great strike, a street demonstration, a hunger riot, a mutiny in
the forces, or a colonial rebellion, but also in consequence of
any political crisis, like the Dreyfus
affair,[4] the Zabern
incident,[5] or in connection with a referendum on the secession
of an oppressed nation, etc.

 

The intensification of national oppression under imperialism
makes it necessary for Social-Democracy not to renounce what the
bourgeoisie describes as the “utopian” struggle for the freedom
of nations to secede, but, on the contrary, to take more
advantage than ever before of conflicts arising also on this
ground for the purpose of rousing mass action and revolutionary
attacks upon the bourgeoisie.

3.
The Meaning of the Right to Self-Determination and its Relation to
Federation


The right of nations to self-determination means only the right to independence
in a political sense, the right to free, political secession from the oppressing
nation. Concretely, this political, democratic demand implies complete
freedom to carry on agitation in favour of secession, and freedom to settle
the question of secession by means of a referendum of the nation that desires
to secede. Consequently, this demand is by no means identical with the
demand for secession, for partition, for the formation of small states.
It is merely the logical expression of the struggle against national oppression
in every form. The more closely the democratic system of state approximates
to complete freedom of secession, the rarer and weaker will the striving
for secession be in practice; for the advantages of large states, both
from the point of view of economic progress and from the point of view
of the interests of the masses, are beyond doubt, and these advantages
increase with the growth of capitalism. The recognition of self-determination
is not the same as making federation a principle. One may be a determined
opponent of this principle and a partisan of democratic centralism and
yet prefer federation to national inequality as the only path towards complete
democratic centralism. It was precisely from this point of view that Marx,
although a centralist, preferred even the federation of Ireland with England
to the forcible subjection of Ireland to the
English.[6]


The aim of socialism is not only to abolish the present division of
mankind into small states and all national isolation; not only to bring
the nations closer to each other, but also to merge them. And in order
to achieve this aim, we must, on the one hand, explain to the masses the
reactionary nature of the ideas of Renner and Otto Bauer concerning

    

so-called
“cultural national
autonomy”[7] and, on the other hand, demand the liberation
of the oppressed nations, not only in general, nebulous phrases, not in
empty declamations, not by “postponing” the question until socialism is
established, but in a clearly and precisely formulated political programme
which shall particularly take into account the hypocrisy and cowardice
of the Socialists in the oppressing nations. Just as mankind can achieve
the abolition of classes only by passing through the transition period
of the dictatorship of the oppressed class, so mankind can achieve the
inevitable merging of nations only by passing through the transition period
of complete liberation of all the oppressed nations, i.e., their freedom
to secede.

4.
The Proletarian-Revolutionary Presentation of the Question of
the Self-Determination of Nations


Not only the demand for the self-determination of nations but all the items
of our democratic minimum programme were advanced before us, as far back
as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, by the petty bourgeoisie.
And the petty bourgeoisie, believing in “peaceful” capitalism, continues
to this day to advance all these demands in a utopian way, without seeing
the class struggle and the fact that it has become intensified under democracy.
The idea of a peaceful union of equal nations under imperialism, which
deceives the people, and which the Kautskyists advocate, is precisely of
this nature. As against this philistine, opportunist utopia, the programme
of Social-Democracy must point out that under imperialism the division
of nations into oppressing and oppressed ones is a fundamental, most important
and inevitable fact.


The proletariat of the oppressing nations cannot confine itself to the
general hackneyed phrases against annexations and for the equal rights
of nations in general, that may be repeated by any pacifist bourgeois.
The proletariat cannot evade the question that is particularly “unpleasant”
for the imperialist bourgeoisie, namely, the question of the frontiers
of a state that is based on national oppression. The proletariat cannot
but fight against the forcible retention of the oppressed nations within
the boundaries of a given state, and this is exactly what the struggle
for the right of self-determination means. The proletariat

    

must demand
the right of political secession for the colonies and for the nations that
“its own” nation oppresses. Unless it does this, proletarian internationalism
will remain a meaningless phrase; mutual confidence and class solidarity
between the workers of the oppressing and oppressed nations will be impossible;
the hypocrisy of the reformist and Kautskyan advocates of self-determination
who maintain silence about the nations which are oppressed by “their” nation
and forcibly retained within “their” state will remain unexposed.


The Socialists of the oppressed nations, on the other hand, must particularly
fight for and maintain complete, absolute unity (also organizational) between
the workers of the oppressed nation and the workers of the oppressing nation.
Without such unity it will be impossible to maintain an independent proletarian
policy and class solidarity with the proletariat of other countries in
the face of all the subterfuge, treachery and trickery of the bourgeoisie;
for the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations always converts the slogan
of national liberation into a means for deceiving the workers; in internal
politics it utilizes these slogans as a means for conduding reactionary
agreements with the bourgeoisie of the ruling nation (for instance, the
Poles in Austria and Russia, who entered into pacts with reaction in order
to oppress the Jews and the Ukrainians); in the realm of foreign politics
it strives to enter into pacts with one of the rival imperialist powers
for the purpose of achieving its own predatory aims (the policies of the
small states in the Balkans, etc.).


The fact that the struggle for national liberation against one imperialist
power may, under certain circumstances, be utilized by another “Great”
Power in its equally imperialist interests should have no more weight in
inducing Social Democracy to renounce its recognition of the right of nations
to self-determination than the numerous case of the bourgeoisie utilizing
republican slogans for the purpose of political deception and financial
robbery, for example, in the Latin countries, have had in inducing them
to renounce
republicanism.[1]
   


    

5.
Marxism and Proudhonism on the National Question


In contrast to the petty-bourgeois democrats, Marx regarded all democratic
demands without exception not as an absolute, but as a historical expression
of the struggle of the masses of the people, led by the bourgeoisie, against
feudalism. There is not a single democratic demand which could not serve,
and has not served, under certain conditions, as an instrument of the bourgeoisie
for deceiving the workers. To single out one of the demands of political
democracy, namely, the self determination of nations, and to oppose it to
all the rest, is fundamentally wrong in theory. In practice, the proletariat
will be able to retain its independence only if it subordinates its struggle
for all the democratic demands, not excluding the demand for a republic,
to its revolutionary struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie.


On the other hand, in contrast to the Proudhonists, who “repudiated”
the national problem “in the name of the social revolution,” Marx, having
in mind mainly the interests of the proletarian class struggle in the advanced
countries, put into the forefront the fundamental principle of internationalism
and socialism, viz., that no nation can be free if it oppresses other
nations.[8]
It was precisely from the standpoint of the interests of the revolutionary
movement of the German workers that Marx in 1898 demanded that victorious
democracy in Germany should proclaim and grant freedom to the nations that
the Germans were
oppressing.[9] It was precisely from the standpoint of the
revolutionary struggle of the English workers that Marx in 1869 demanded
the separation of Ireland from England, and added: “...although after the
separation there may come
federation.”[10]
Only by putting forward this demand
did Marx really educate the English workers in the spirit

    

of internationalism.
Only in this way was he able to oppose the revolutionary solution of a
given historical problem to the opportunists and bourgeois reformism, which
even now, half a century later, has failed to achieve the Irish “reform.”
Only in this way was Marx able—unlike the apologists of capital who shout
about the right of small nations to secession being utopian and impossible,
and about the progressive nature not only of economic but also of political
concentration—to urge the progressive nature of this concentration in
a non-imperialist manner, to urge the bringing together of the nations,
not by force, but on the basis of a free union of the proletarians of all
countries. Only in this way was Marx able, also in the sphere of the solution
of national problems, to oppose the revolutionary action of the masses
to verbal and often hypocritical recognition of the equality and the self-determination
of nations. The imperialist war of 1914-16 and the Augean stables of
hypocrisy of the opportunists and Kautskyists it exposed have strikingly
confirmed the correctness of Marx’s policy, which must serve as the model
for all the advanced countries; for all of them now oppress other
nations.[2]

6.
Three Types of Countries in Relation to Self-Determination of Nations


In this respect, countries must be divided into three main types:


First, the advanced capitalist countries of Western Europe and the United
States of America. In these countries the bourgeois, progressive, national
movements came to an end long ago. Every

    

one of these “great” nations oppresses
other nations in the colonies and within its own country. The tasks of
the proletariat of these ruling nations are the same as those of the proletariat
in England in the nineteenth century in relation to
Ireland.[3]


Secondly, Eastern Europe: Austria, the Balkans and particularly Russia.
Here it was the twentieth century that particularly developed the bourgeois-democratic
national movements and intensified the national struggle. The tasks of
the proletariat in these countries—in regard to the consummation of their
bourgeois-democratic reformation, as well as in regard to assisting the
socialist revolution in other countries—cannot be achieved unless it
champions the right of nations to self-determination. In this connection
the most difficult but most important task is to merge the class struggle
of the workers in the oppressing nations with the class struggle of the
workers in the oppressed nations.


Thirdly, the semi-colonial countries, like China, Persia, Turkey, and
all the colonies, which have a combined population amounting to a billion.
In these countries the bourgeois-democratic movements have either hardly
begun, or are far from having been completed. Socialists must not only
demand the unconditional and immediate liberation of the colonies without
compensation—and this demand in its political expression signifies nothing
more nor less than the recognition of the right to self-determination—but must render determined support to the more revolutionary elements in
the bourgeois-democratic movements for national liberation

    

in these countries
and assist their rebellion—and if need be, their revolutionary war—against the imperialist powers that oppress them.

7. Social-Chauvinism and Self Determination of Nations


The imperialist epoch and the war of 1914-16 have particularly brought
to the forefront the task of fighting against chauvinism and nationalism
in the advanced countries. On the question of the self-determination of
nations, there are two main shades of opinion among the social-chauvinists,
i.e., the opportunists and the Kautskyists, who embellish the reactionary,
imperialist war by declaring it to be a war in “defence of the fatherland.”


On the one hand, we see the rather avowed servants of the bourgeoisie
who defend annexations on the ground that imperialism and political concentration
are progressive and who repudiate the right to self-determination on the
ground that it is utopian, illusory, petty-bourgeois, etc. Among these
may be included Cunow, Parvus and the extreme opportunists in Germany,
a section of the Fabians and the trade union leaders in England, and the
opportunists, Semkovsky, Liebman, Yurkevich, etc., in Russia.


On the other hand, we see the Kautskyists, including Vandervelde, Renaudel,
and many of the pacifists in England, France, etc. These stand for unity
with the first-mentioned group, and in practice their conduct is the same
in that they advocate the right to self-determination in a purely verbal
and hypocritical way. They regard the demand for the freedom of political
secession as being “excessive” (“zu viel verlangt”—Kautsky, in the Neue
Zeit, May 21, 1915); they do not advocate the need for revolutionary tactics,
especially for the Socialists in the oppressing nations, but, on the contrary,
they gloss over their revolutionary duties, they justify their opportunism,
they make it easier to deceive the people, they evade precisely the question
of the frontiers of a state which forcibly retains subject nations, etc.


Both groups are opportunists who prostitute Marxism and who have lost
all capacity to understand the theoretical significance and the practical
urgency of Marx’s tactics, an example of which he gave in relation to Ireland.

 

The specific question of annexations has become a particularly urgent
one owing to the war. But what is annexation! Clearly, to protest against
annexations implies either the recognition of the right of self-determination
of nations, or that the protest is based on a pacifist phrase which defends
the status quo and opposes all violence including revolutionary violence.
Such a phrase is radically wrong, and incompatible with Marxism.

8. The Concrete Tasks of the Proletariat in the Immediate Future


The socialist revolution may begin in the very near future. In that event
the proletariat will be faced with the immediate task of capturing power,
of expropriating the banks and of introducing other dictatorial measures.
In such a situation, the bourgeoisie, and particularly intellectuals like
the Fabians and the Kautskyists, will strive to disrupt and to hinder
the revolution, to restrict it to limited democratic aims. While all purely
democratic demands may—at a time when the proletarians have already begun
to storm the bulwarks of bourgeois power—serve, in a certain sense,
as a hindrance to the revolution, nevertheless, the necessity of proclaiming
and granting freedom to all oppressed nations (i.e., their right to
self-determination)
will be as urgent in the socialist revolution as it was urgent for the
victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, for example, in Germany
in 1848, or in Russia in 1905.


However, five, ten and even more years may pass before the socialist
revolution begins. In that case, the task will be to educate the masses
in a revolutionary spirit so as to make it impossible for Socialist chauvinists
and opportunists to belong to the workers’ party and to achieve a victory
similar to that of 1914-16. It will be the duty of the Socialists to explain
to the masses that English Socialists who fail to demand the freedom of
secession for the colonies and for Ireland; that German Socialists who
fail to demand the freedom of secession for the colonies, for the Alsatians,
for the Danes and for the Poles, and who fail to carry direct revolutionary
propaganda and revolutionary mass action to the field of struggle against
national oppression, who fail to take advantage of cases like the Zabern
incident to conduct widespread underground propaganda among the proletariat
of the oppressing nation, to organize

    

street demonstrations and revolutionary
mass actions; that Russian Socialists who fail to demand freedom of secession
for Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, etc., etc.—are behaving like chauvinists,
like lackeys of the blood-and-mud-stained imperialist monarchies and the
imperialist bourgeoisie.

9.
The Attitude of Russian and Polish Social-Democracy and of the
Second International to Self-Determination


The difference between the revolutionary Social-Democrats of Russia and
the Polish Social-Democrats on the question of self-determination came
to the surface as early as 1903 at the congress which adopted the programme
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, and which, despite the protest
of the Polish Social-Democratic delegation, inserted in that programme
point 9, which recognizes the right of nations to self-determination. Since
then the Polish Social Democrats have never repeated, in the name of their
Party, the proposal to delete point 9 from our programme, or to substitute
some other formulation for it.


In Russia—where no less than 57%, i.e., over 100,000,000
of the population, belong to oppressed nations, where those nations mainly
inhabit the border provinces, where some of those nations are more cultured
than the Great Russians, where the political system is distinguished by
its particularly barbarous and mediaeval character, where the bourgeois-democratic
revolution has not yet been completed—the recognition of the right of
the nations oppressed by tsarism to free secession from Russia is absolutely
obligatory for Social-Democracy in the interests of its democratic and
socialist tasks. Our Party, which was re-established in January 1912, adopted
a resolution in
1913[11] reiterating the right to self-determination and explaining
it in the concrete sense outlined above. The orgy of Great-Russian chauvinism
raging in 1914-16 among the bourgeoisie and the opportunist Socialists
(Rubanovich, Plekhanov, Nashe Dyelo, etc.) prompts us to insist on this
demand more strongly than ever and to declare that those who reject it
serve, in practice, as a bulwark of Great-Russian chauvinism and tsarism.
Our party declares that it emphatically repudiates all responsibility for
such opposition to the right of self-determination.

 

The latest formulation
of the position of Polish Social-Democracy on the national question (the
declaration made by Polish Social-Democracy at the Zimmerwald Conference)
contains the following ideas:


This declaration condemns the German and other governments which regard
the “Polish provinces” as a hostage in the forthcoming game of compensations
and thus “deprive the Polish people of the opportunity to decide its own
fate.” The declaration says: “Polish Social-Democracy emphatically and
solemnly protests against the recarving and partition of a whole country”
. . . It condemns the Socialists who left to the Hohenzollerns “the task
of liberating the oppressed nations.” It expresses the conviction that
only participation in the impending struggle of the revolutionary international
proletariat, in the struggle for socialism, “will break the fetters of
national oppression and abolish all forms of foreign domination, and secure
for the Polish people the possibility of all-sided, free development as
an equal member in a League of Nations.” The declaration also recognizes
the present war to be “doubly fratricidal” “for the Poles.” (Bulletin
of the International Socialist Committee, No. 2, September 27, 1915,
p. 15.)


There is no difference in substance between these postulates and the
recognition of the right of nations to self-determination except that their
political formulation is still more diffuse and vague than the majority
of the programmes and resolutions of the Second International. Any attempt
to express these ideas in precise political formulae and to determine whether
they apply to the capitalist system or only to the socialist system will
prove still more strikingly the error committed by the Polish Social-Democrats
in repudiating the self-determination of nations.


The decision of the International Socialist Congress held in London
in 1896, which recognized the self-determination of nations, must, on the
basis of the above-mentioned postulates, be supplemented by references
to:
(1) the particular urgency of this demand under imperialism;
(2) the politically conditional nature and the class content of all the
demands of political democracy, including this demand;
(3) the necessity of drawing a distinction between the concrete tasks
of the Social-Democrats in the oppressing nations and those in

    

oppressed
nations;
(4) the inconsistent, purely verbal, and, therefore, as
far as its political significance is concerned, hypocritical
recognition of self-determination by the opportunists and Kautskyists;
(5) the actual identity of the chauvinists and those Social-Democrats,
particularly the Social-Democrats of the Great Powers (Great Russians,
Anglo-Americans, Germans, French, Italians, Japanese, etc.) who fail to
champion the freedom of secession for the colonies and nations oppressed
by “their own” nations;
(6) the necessity of subordinating the struggle for this demand, as well
as for all the fundamental demands of political democracy, to the immediate
revolutionary mass struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeois governments
and for the achievement of socialism.


To transplant to the International the point of view of some of the
small nations—particularly the point of view of the Polish Social-Democrats,
who, in their struggle against the Polish bourgeoisie which is deceiving
the people with nationalist slogans, were misled into repudiating self-determination—would be a theoretical error. It would be the substitution of Proudhonism
for Marxism and, in practice, would result in rendering involuntary support
to the most dangerous chauvinism and opportunism of the Great Power nations.


Editorial Board of Sotsial-Democrat,
Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.


Postscript. In Die Neue Zeit for March 3,
1916, which has just appeared, Kautsky openly holds out the hand
of Christian reconciliation to Austerlitz, a representative of
the foulest German chauvinism, rejecting freedom of separation
for the oppressed nations of Hapsburg Austria but recognising it
for Russian Poland, as a menial service to Hindenburg
and Wilhelm II. One could not have wished for a better
self-exposure of Kautskyism!


 
Notes
 

[1]

Needless to say, to repudiate the right of self-determination on the
ground that logically it means “defence of the fatherland” would be quite
ridiculous. With equal logic, i.e., with equal shallowness, the social-chauvinists
of 1914-16 apply this argument to every one of the demands of

   

democracy
(for instance, to republicanism), and to every formulation of the struggle
against national oppression, in order to justify “defence of the fatherland.”
Marxism arrives at the recognition of defence of the fatherland, for example,
in the wars of the Great French Revolution and the Garibaldi wars in Europe,
and at the repudiation of defence of the fatherland in the imperialist
war of 1914-16, from the analysis of the specific historical circumstances
of each separate war, and not from some “general principle,” or some separate
item of a programme.

Dear Comrades,


The recent No. 25 issue (the second to come out during
the war) of Gazeta
Robotnicza,[2] the
organ of the opposition of the Polish Social-Democratic
Party, carries the resolutions of their conference (a conference
of the Editorial Board) adopted back in June 1915.


These resolutions clearly show that as a body (we say
nothing of its members as individuals, some of whom are doing
extremely useful work in the German Social-Democratic press), the
Polish Social-Democrats are once again vacillating in a
most spineless manner.


There’s not a word against Kautskyism, not a word
about any determined and resolute struggle against
opportunism, as the source and buttress
of social-chauvinism!! This can be read in one way only: they
are prepared once again (as in Brussels, July 3-16,
=

1914[3]) “to play ball” with the Kautskyites.


We quote the main (IV) resolution in full. Here it is:


Gazeta Robotnicza P.S.D. (of the opposition) No. 25
(January 1916). “Resolutions of the Editorial Board conference
held on June 1-2, 1915.”


IV. The Attitude of the Social-Democrats of Poland
and Lithuania to the
R.S.D.L.P.[1]


“The Polish revolutionary Social-Democrats regard the
Central Committee of the R.S.D. L.P, as a body consisting

    

of
the most resolute revolutionary internationalist elements in Russia,
and, while leaving it to the regional organisation to
settle its organisational relations with. it in the future, will
give it political support and co-ordinate their activity with
it.


“The common revolutionary stand of the Polish Social-Democrats
and the Central Committee on the main essential [wytycznych
(definite?)] points of their policy makes it
incumbent on the Social-Democrats of Poland and
Lithuania to continue taking a critical attitude
to its obvious tactical exaggerations [wybujato&swhattheci
(“wild” growth of corn, etc.)].


“While justly desiring to emphasise the proletariat’s
unquestionably hostile attitude to tsarism’s plunderous policy,
the Central Committee puts forward the slogan of
Russia’s defeat, basing it on the especially reactionary
part tsarism has to play in Europe and the specific significance
of a Russian revolution; however, this brings the Central
Committee into contradiction with the method of
internationalism, which does not allow proletarian hopes and tasks
to be pinned on any definite outcome of the war, and even provides
the German social-patriots with arguments.


“While justly noting the need for revolutionary action to build
a new international, while justly opposing every attempt to gloss
over the conflict, and piece together the broken old
international, the C.C., however, overrate the importance of
automatically fencing themselves off from all less resolute
elements which do not accept their standpoint a priori,
and forget [przeocta] that the
task of the revolutionary camp
[obozu] must not be to repulse these elements
but to draw them into the struggle against the
fraud [szalbierstwem] of
social-patriotism, and to promote their radicalisation by
sharply criticising their ideological instability.


“As for the O.C. (R.S.D.L.P), the conference
[narada] reaffirms that its main group, which is in
Russia, and also its literary representative
[ekspozytura lileracka] take the social-patriotic
standpoint, and that its weak internationalist wing has neither
the strength nor the courage to break with the
social-patriots, and that the O.C. Centre takes the pacifist
standpoint; the conference considers that the attitude of the
Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania to

    

the O.C. can
consist exclusively of criticism of its position, promoting
its disintegration [rozktadu] and separating
from the O.C. its internationalist elements grouped
around Nashe Slovo, an organ which has done a great deal
to elaborate  [crysiallise] internationalist-revolutionary views
in the ranks of the R.S.D.L.P.


“The same applies, in particular, also to the Bund, which is a
part of the O.C., for its attitude is an even greater chaotic
mixture of social-patriotic and pacifist, Russophile and
Germanophile elements.”


The Polish Social-Democrats say here that they wish to
“co-ordinate” their activity with the Central Committee.


We believe it to he our unquestionable duty to toll the Central
Committee this: title Central Committee must not and cannot
“co-ordinate” their activity with the P.S,D.


Why not?


Because the P.S.D. is vacillating again and again, for
the nth time (or playing a game, which is objectively the same
thing) on our Party’s cardinal question. There is no
doubt that the key issue in the Russian Social-Democratic movement
today is that of the split.


On this point we are adamant, because the entire
experience of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia,
especially in the 1903-09 period, and even more between 1910 and
1914, and most of all in the years 1915 and 1916, has
served to convince us that unity with the O.C. (or
with the Chkheidze group, which is the same thing) is
harmful to the working-class movement, and, ensures
its subjugation to the bourgeoisie.


The war and
Gvozdyovism[4] have provided the final
proof.


But it is on this chief, basic and fundamental issue that the
Polish Social-Democrats are again equivocating.


They say not a word about the war having convinced
them of the need for a split and of tire erroneousness of
their tactics at Brussels (July 3–16, 1914).


On the contrary, they have inserted in the resolution a
phrase which looks as if it had been deliberately worded
to justify and do another “Brussels” desertion to the O.C. or
Chkheidze. Here it is:


“The Central Committee overrate the importance of automatically
fencing themselves off....”

 

That is the whole point. The rest is just rhetoric. If
the Central Committee “overrate” the need for a split, it is clear
that the P.S.D. are entitled today or tomorrow to vote again
for another Brussels-Kautskyite “unity” resolution.


It is the same old Tyszka
trick,[5] the old game
Between the C.C. and the O.C., the old eclectical (to put it
mildly) use of the pendulum position.


We have no objection at all to working with the
P.S.D., either in general, or in the Zimmerwald Left in
particular; nor do we defend every fetter of our
resolutions; but we are adamant on (1)
the split in Russia and (2) that there be no reconciliation
with Kautskyism in Europe. We consider it to be our duty to warn
all comrades that the Polish Social Democrats are unreliable,
and to insist that the C.C. must not let itself he drawn once
again into a repetition of “Brussels” experiments, or trust the
authors of these experiments or participants in them.


With comradely greetings, C.O.A.

The question of the Social-Democratic “peace programme.” Is one
of the most important questions on the agenda of the Second
International Conference of the


“Zimmerwaldists”.[1]In order to
bring home to the reader the essentials of this
question we will quote a declaration made by Kautsky, the most
authoritative representative of the Second International and
most authoritative champion of the social-chauvinists in all
countries.


“The International is not a fit instrument in time of war; it
is, essentially, an instrument of peace... The fight for peace,
class struggle in peace time.” (Neue Zeit. November 27,
1914.) “All peace programmes formulated by the International;the
programmes of the Copenhagen, London and Vienna Congresses, all
demand, and quite rightly, the recognition of the independence
of nations. This demand must also serve as our compass in the
present war.” (Ibid., May 21, 1915.)


These few words excellently express the “programme” of
international social-chauvinist unity and
conciliation. Everybody knows that Sudekum’s friends and
adherents met in Vienna and acted entirely in his spirit,
championing the cause of German imperialism under the cloak of
“defence of the fatherland.” The French, English and Russian
Sudekums met in London and championed the cause of “their”
national imperialism under the same cloak. The real policy of
the London and Vienna heroes of social-chauvinism is to justify
participation in the imperialist war, to justify the killing of
German workers by French workers, and vice versa, for
the sake of determining which national bourgeoisie shall have
preference in robbing other countries. And to conceal their real
policy, to deceive the workers, both the London and

    

the Vienna
heroes resort to the phrase: We “recognise” the
“independence of nations,” or in other words, recognise the
self-determination of nations, repudiate annexations, etc., etc.


It is as clear as daylight that this “recognition” is a flagrant
lie, despicable hypocrisy, for it justifies participation in a
war which both sides are waging, not to make nations
independent, but to enslave them. Instead of exposing, unmasking
and condemning this hypocrisy, Kautsky, the great authority,
sanctifies it. The unanimous desire of the chauvinist
traitors to Socialism to deceive the workers is, in Kautsky’s
eyes, proof of the “unanimity” and virility of the International
on the question of peace!!! Kautsky converts nationalist, crude,
obvious, flagrant hypocrisy, which is obvious to the workers,
into international, subtle, cloaked hypocrisy, calculated to
throw dust in the eyes of the workers. Kautsky’s policy is a
hundred times more harmful and dangerous to the labour movement
than Sudekum’s policy; Kautsky’s hypocrisy is a hundred times
more repulsive.


This does not apply to Kautsky alone. Substantially the same
policy is pursued by Axelrod, Martov and Chkheidze in Russia; by
Longuet and Pressemane in France, Treves in Italy,
etc. Objectively, this policy means fostering bourgeois lies
among the working class; it means inculcating bourgeois ideas
into the minds of the proletariat. That both Sudekum and
Plekhanov merely repeat the bourgeois lies of the capitalists of
“their” respective nations is obvious; but it is not so obvious
that Kautsky sanctifies these lies and elevates them to
the sphere of the “highest truth” of a “unanimous”
International. That the workers should regard the Sudekums and
Plekhanovs as authoritative and unanimous “Socialists” who have
temporarily fallen out is exactly what the bourgeoisie
wants. The very thing the bourgeoisie wants is that the workers
should be diverted from the revolutionary struggle in
wartime by means of hypocritical, idle and non-committal phrases
about peace; that they should be lulled and soothed by hopes of
peace without annexations, a democratic peace, etc., etc.


Huysmans has merely popularised Kautsky’s peace programme and
has added: courts of arbitration, democratisation of foreign
politics, etc. But the first and fundamental

    

point of a
Socialist peace programme must be to unmask the
hypocrisy of the Kautskyist peace programme, which
strengthens bourgeois influence over the proletariat.


Let us recall the fundamental postulates of Socialist doctrine,
which the Kautskyists have distorted. War is the continuation,
by forcible means, of the politics pursued by the ruling classes
of the belligerent Powers long before the outbreak of war. Peace
is a continuation of the very same politics, with a
registration of the changes brought about in the
relation of forces of the antagonists as a result of military
operations. War does not change the direction in which politics
developed prior to the war; it only accelerates that
development.


The war of 1870–71 was a continuation of the progressive
bourgeois policy (which was pursued for decades) of liberating
and uniting Germany. The debacle and overthrow of
Napoleon III hastened that liberation. The peace programme of
the Socialists of that epoch took this progressive bourgeois
result into account and advocated support for the democratic
bourgeoisie, urging: no plunder of France; an honourable peace
with the republic.


How clownish is the attempt slavishly to repeat this example
under the conditions prevailing during the imperialist war of
1914-16! This war is the continuation of the politics of an
over-ripe reactionary bourgeoisie, which has plundered the
world, which has seized colonies, etc. Owing to the objective
situation, the present war cannot, on the basis of
bourgeois relations, lead to any democratic “progress” whatever;
no matter what the outcome of the war may be, it can lead only
to the intensification and extension of oppression in general,
and of national oppression in particular.


That war accelerated development in a democratic
bourgeois-progressive direction: it resulted in the overthrow
of Napoleon III and in the unification of
Germany. This war is accelerating development
only in the direction of the socialist
revolution. Then the programme of a democratic
(bourgeois) peace had an objective historical
basis. Now there is no such basis, and all phrases
about a democratic peace is a bourgeois lie, the objective
purpose of which is to divert the workers from the
revolutionary struggle for socialism! Then the
Socialists, by their programme of a democratic peace,
supported a deep-going bourgeois-democratic movement of the
masses (for the overthrow

    

of Napoleon III and the unification
of Germany), which had been manifesting itself for
decades. Now, with their programme of a democratic
peace on the basis of bourgeois relations the Socialists are
helping the deception of the people by the
bourgeoisie, whose aim is to divert the proletariat from the
socialist revolution.


Just as phrases about “defence of the fatherland” inculcate into
the minds of the masses the ideology of a national war of
liberation by means of fraud, so phrases about a democratic
peace inculcate that very same bourgeois lie in a
roundabout way.


“That means that you have no peace programme, that you are
opposed to democratic demands,” the Kautskyists argue, in the
hope that inattentive people will not notice that this objection
substitutes non-existent bourgeois-democratic tasks for the
existing socialist tasks.


Oh no, gentlemen, we reply to the Kautskyists. We are in
favour of democratic demands, we alone fight
for them sincerely, for the objective historical
situation prevents us from advancing them except in connection
with the socialist revolution. Take, for example, the “compass”
which Kautsky and Co. employ for the bourgeois deception of the
workers.


Südekum and Plekhanov are “unanimous” in their “peace
programme.” Down with annexations! Support the independence of
nations! And note this: the Südekums are right when
they say that Russia’s attitude towards Poland, Finland, etc.,
is an annexationist attitude. And so is Plekhanov right when he
says that Germany’s attitude towards Alsace-Lorraine, Serbia,
Belgium, etc, is also annexationist. Both are right, are they
not) And in this way Kautsky “reconciles” the German Südekum
with the Russian Südekums!!!


But every sensible worker will see immediately that Kautsky and
both the Südekums are hypocrites. This is obvious. The
duty of a Socialist is not to make peace with
hypocritical democracy, but to unmask it. How can it be
unmasked? Very simply. “Recognition” of the independence of
nations can be regarded as sincere only where the
representative of the oppressing nation has demanded, both
before and during the war, freedom of secession for the nation
which is oppressed by his own “fatherland.”

 

This demand alone is in accord with Marxism. Marx advanced it in
the interests of the English proletariat when he demanded
freedom for Ireland, although he admitted at the same time the
probability that federation would follow secession. In other
words, he demanded the right of secession, not for the purpose
of splitting and isolating countries, but for the purpose of
creating more durable and democratic ties. In all cases where
there are oppressed and oppressing nations, where there are no
special circumstances which distinguish revolutionary-democratic
nations from reactionary nations (as was the case in the
’forties of the nineteenth century), Marx’s policy in relation
to Ireland must serve as a model for proletarian policy. But
imperialism is precisely the epoch in which the division of
nations into oppressors and oppressed is the essential and
typical division, and it is utterly impossible to draw a
distinction between reactionary and revolutionary nations in
Europe.


As early as 1913, our Party, in a resolution on the national
question, made it the duty of Social-Democrats to apply the term
self-determination in the sense here indicated. And the war of
1914-16 has fully shown that we were right.


Take Kautsky’s latest article in the Neue Zeit of March
3, 1916. He openly declares himself to be in agreement
with Austerlitz, the notorious, extreme German chauvinist in
Austria, the editor of the chauvinist Vienna
Arbeirer-Zeitung,[2] when he says that “the independence
of a nation must not be confused with its sovereignty”.
In other words, national autonomy within a “nationality state”
is good enough for the oppressed nations, and it is not
necessary to demand for them the equal right to political
independence. In this very article, however, Kautsky asserts
that it is impossible to prove that “it is essential for the
Poles to adhere to the Russian state”!!!


What does this mean? It means that to please Hindenburg,
Südekum, Austerlitz and Co, Kautsky recognises Poland’s right
to secede from Russia, although Russia is a
“nationality state,” but not a word does he say about freedom
for the Poles to secede from Germany!!! In this very article
Kautsky declares that the French Socialists had departed from
internationalism by wanting to achieve the freedom of
Alsace-Lorraine by means of war. But he says nothing
about the German Südekums and Co.



deviating

    

from
internationalism when they refuse to demand freedom for
Alsace-Lorraine to secede from Germany!


Kautsky employs the phrase “a nationality state”—a phrase
that can he applied to England in relation to Ireland, and to
Germany in relation to Poland, Alsace-Lorraine,
etc.—obviously for the purpose of defending
social-chauvinism. He has converted the slogan “fight against
annexations” into a “programme of peace”... with the
chauvinists, into glaring hypocrisy. And in this very article,
Kautsky repeats the honeyed little udas speech: “The
International has never ceased to demand the consent of the
affected populations when state frontiers are to be altered.” Is
it not clear that Südekum and Co. demand the “consent” of the
Alsatians and Belgians to be annexed to Germany and that
Austerlitz and Co. demand the “consent” of the Poles and Serbs
to be annexed to Austria!


And what about the Russian Kautskyist Martov He wrote to the
Gvozdevist journal Nash
Golos[3] (Samara) to prove the
indisputable truth that self-determination of nations does not
necessarily imply defence of the fatherland in an imperialist
war. But Martov says nothing about the fact that a Russian
Social-Democrat betrays the principle of self-determination if
he does not demand the right of secession for
the nations oppressed by the Great Russians; and in this way
Martov stretches out the hand of peace to the Alexinskys, the
Gvozdevs, the Dotresovs, and the Plekhanovs! Martov is silent on
this point also in the underground press! He argues against the
Dutchman Gorter, although Gorter, while wrongly repudiating the
principle of self-determination of nations, correctly
applies it by demanding political independence
for the Dutch Indies and by unmasking the betrayal of Socialism
by the Dutch opportunists who disagree with this demand. Martov,
however, does not argue against his secretary, Semkovsky, who in
1912-15 was the only writer in the liquidationist press
who repudiated the right of secession and
self-determination in general!


Is it not plain that Martov “advocates” self-determination just
as hypocritically as Kautsky does; that he, too, is covering up
his desire to make peace with the chauvinists?

 

And what about Trotsky? He is body and soul for
self-determination, but in his case, too, it is an idle phrase,
for he does not demand freedom of secession for nations
oppressed by the “fatherland” of the Socialist of the
given nationality; he is silent about the
hypocrisy of Kautsky and the Kautskyists!


This kind of “struggle against annexations” serves to deceive
the workers and not to explain the programme of the
Social-Democrats; it is an evasion of the problem and
not a concrete indication of the duty of internationalists; it
is a concession to nationalist prejudices and to the selfish
interests of nationalism (“we” all, bourgeois and
social-chauvinists alike, derive “benefits” from “our”
fatherland’s oppression of other nations!) but not a struggle
against nationalism.


The “peace programme” of Social-Democracy must, in the first
place, unmask the hypocrisy of the bourgeois, social-chauvinist
and Kautskyist phrases about peace. This is the first and
fundamental thing. Unless we do that we shall be willingly or
unwillingly helping to deceive the masses. Our “peace
programme” demands that the principal democratic point on this
question—the repudiation of annexations—should be
applied in practice and not in words, that it should serve to
promote the propaganda of internationalism, not of national
hypocrisy. In order that this may do so, we must explain to the
masses that the repudiation of annexations, i.e., the
recognition of self-determination, is sincere only when the
Socialists of every nation demand the right of
secession for the nations that are oppressed by their
nations. As a positive slogan, one capable of drawing the masses
into the revolutionary struggle and explaining the necessity for
adopting revolutionary measures to attain a “democratic peace,”
we must advance the slogan: Repudiation of the National Debt.


Finally, our “peace programme” must explain that the imperialist
Powers and the imperialist bourgeoisie cannot grant a
democratic peace. Such a peace must be sought and
fought for, not in the past, not in a
reactionary utopia of a non-imperialist capitalism, nor in a
league of equal nations under capitalism, but in
the future, in the socialist revolution of the
proletariat. Not a single fundamental democratic demand can be
achieved to any considerable

    

extent, or any degree of
permanency, in the advanced imperialist states, except by
revolutionary battles under the banner of socialism.


Whoever promises the nations a “democratic” peace without at the
same time preaching the socialist revolution, or while
repudiating the struggle for it—the struggle which must be
carried on now, during the war—is deceiving the
proletariat.

(Theses on points 5, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 of the agenda: the
struggle to end the war; the attitude towards the problems of
peace, parliamentary action and mass struggles, and the
convocation of the International Socialist
Bureau.[2])


(The International Socialist Committee, in its notice convening
the Second Conference, invited the affiliated organisations to
discuss the above questions, and to send in their proposals. In
reply to this invitation our Party submits the following
theses.)



1. Just as all war is but a continuation by violent means of the
politics which the belligerent states and their
ruling classes had been conducting for many years, sometimes
for decades, before the outbreak of war, so the
peace that ends any war can be nothing but a consideration
and a record of the actual changes brought about in the
relation of forces in the course of and as a result of the
war.


2. As long as the foundations of present, i.e., bourgeois,
social relations remain intact, an imperialist war can lead
only to an imperialist peace, i.e., to greater, more
extensive and more intense oppression of wreak nations and
countries by finance capital, which grew to
gigantic proportions not only in the period prior to
the war, but also during the war. The objective content of
the policies pursued by the bourgeoisie and the governments
of both groups of Great Powers before and during the
war leads to intensified economic oppression, national
enslavement and political reaction. Therefore, provided the
bourgeois social system remains,

    

the peace that follows upon
the war, whatever its outcome, must perpetuate this worsening
of the economic and political condition of the masses.


To assume that a democratic peace may emerge from an imperialist
war is, in theory, to substitute vulgar phrases for an
historical study of the policies conducted before and during
that war. In practice, it is to deceive the masses of the people
by beclouding their political consciousness, by covering up and
prettifying the real policies pursued by the ruling classes to
prepare the ground for the coming peace, by concealing from the
masses the main thing, namely, that a democratic peace is
impossible without a whole series of revolutions.


3. Socialists do not refuse to fight for reform. Even now, for
example, they must vote in parliament for improvements,
however slight, in the condition of the masses, for increased
relief to the inhabitants of the devastated areas, for the
lessening of national oppression, etc. But it is sheer
bourgeois deception to preach reforms as a solution
for problems for which history and the actual political
situation demand revolutionary solutions ’That is precisely
the kind of problems the present war has brought to the
fore. These are the fundamental questions of imperialism,
i.e., the very existence of capitalist society, the questions
of postponing the collapse of capitalism by a re-division of
the world to correspond to the new relation of forces among
the “Great” Powers, which in the last few decades have
developed, not only at fantastic speed, but—and this is
particularly important—also with extreme
unevenness. Real political activity working a change in the
relation of social forces, and not merely deceiving the
masses with words, is now possible only in one of two
forms—either helping “one’s own” national bourgeoisie to
rob other countries (and calling this “defence of the
fatherland” or “saving the country”), or assisting the
proletarian socialist revolution fostering and stirring up
the ferment which is beginning among the masses in all the
belligerent countries, aiding the incipient strikes and
demonstrations, etc., extending and sharpening these as yet
feeble expressions of revolutionary mass struggle into a
general proletarian assault to overthrow the bourgeoisie.

    


 

Just as all the social-chauvinists are at present deceiving the
people by covering up the real, i.e., imperialist,
policy of the capitalists, which is being continued in the
present war with hypocritical phrases about the “dishonest”
attack and “honest” defence on the part of this or that group
of predatory capitalists, so phrases about a “a democratic peace” serve only to deceive the people, as if the
coming peace, which is already being prepared by the capitalists
and diplomats, could “simply” abolish “dishonest” attacks and
restore “honest” relations, and as if it would not be a
continuation, a development, and a perpetuation of this very
imperialist policy, i.e., a policy of financial looting,
colonial robbery, national oppression, political reaction and
intensified capitalist exploitation in every form. What the
capitalists and their diplomats now need is
“socialist” servants of the bourgeoisie to deafen, dupe and
drug the people with talk about a “democratic peace”
so as to cover up the real policy of the bourgeoisie,
making it difficult for the masses to realise the
real nature of this policy and diverting them from the
revolutionary struggle.


4. The “democratic” peace programme, in drafting which prominent
representatives of the Second International are now engaged,
is precisely such a piece of bourgeois deception and
hypocrisy. For example, Huysmans at the Arnhem
Congress[3]
and Kautsky in Die Neue Zeff, the most authoritative,
official, and “theoretical” spokesmen of this International,
formulated this programme as suspension of the revolutionary
struggle until the imperialist governments have concluded
peace; in the meantime, there are verbal repudiation of
annexations and indemnities, verbal recognition of the
self-determination of nations, democratisation of
foreign politics, courts of arbitration to examine
international conflicts between states, disarmament, a United
States of
Europe,[4]
etc., etc. The real political
significance of this “peace programme” was revealed
with particular force by Kautsky, when, to prove the
“unanimity of the International” on this question, he cited
the unanimous adoption by the London Conference
(February 1915) and the Vienna Conference (April
1915) of the main point of this programme, namely, the
“independence of nations”. Kautsky, before the whole world,
thus openly gave his sanction to the

    

deliberate
deception of the people perpetrated by the
social-chauvinists, who combine verbal, hypocritical
recognition of “independence” or self-determination of
nations, recognition that binds no one and leads nowhere,
with support for “their own” governments in the imperialist
war, notwithstanding the fact that on both sides the
war is accompanied by systematic violations of the
“independence” of weak nations and is being waged for the
purpose of consolidating and extending their oppression.


Objectively, this cheap “peace programme” reinforces the
subjection of the working class to the bourgeoisie by
“reconciling” the workers, who are beginning to develop a
revolutionary struggle, with their chauvinist leaders, by
underplaying the gravity of the crisis in the socialist movement
to bring back the pre-war state of affairs in the socialist
parties which led the majority of the leaders to desert to the
bourgeoisie. The fact that this “Kautskyite” policy is clothed
in plausible phrases and that it is being conducted not only in
Germany but in all countries, makes it all the more dangerous
for the proletariat. In Britain, for instance, this policy is
being pursued by the majority of the leaders; in France, by
Longuet, Pressemane and others; in Russia, by Axelrod, Martov,
Chkheidze and others; Chkheidze is screening the chauvinist idea
of “defence of the country” in the present war with the “save
the country” phrase, paying lip-service to Zimmerwald, on the
one hand, and on the other, praising Huysmans’s notorious Arnhem
speech in an official declaration by his group: but neither from
the floor of the Duma nor in the press has he actually opposed
the participation of the workers in the war industries
committees, and remains on the staff of newspapers advocating
such participation. In Italy, a similar policy is being pursued
by Treves: see the threat made by
Avanti!,[5]
the Central
Organ of the Italian Socialist Party, of March 5, 1916, to
expose  Treves  and  other  ”reformist-possibilists”, to expose
those “who resorted to every means to prevent the Party
Executive and Oddino Morgari from taking action to secure unity
at Zimmerwald and to create a new International”, etc., etc.


5. The chief of the “peace questions” at the present time is
that of annexations. It most strikingly reveals the now

    

prevailing socialist hypocrisy and the tasks of real
socialist propaganda and agitation.


It is necessary to explain the meaning of annexations, and why
and how socialists must fight against them, Not every
appropriation of “foreign” territory can be described as an
annexation, for, generally speaking, socialists favour the
abolition of frontiers between nations and the formation of
larger states; nor can every disturbance of the status
quo be described as an annexation, for this would be
extremely reactionary and a mockery of the fundamental concepts
of the science of history; nor can every military seizure of
territory be called annexation, for socialists cannot repudiate
violence and wars in the interests of the majority of the
population. Annexation must apply only to the appropriation of
territory against the will of the population
of that territory; in other words, the concept of annexation is
inseparably bound up with the concept of self-determination of
nations.


The present war, however—precisely bemuse it is an
imperialist war insofar as -both groups of belligerent
powers are concerned-inevitably had to and did give rise to the
phenomenon of the bourgeoisie and the social-chauvinists
“fighting” violently against annexations when this is done by an
enemy state. This kind of “struggle against annexations” and
this kind of “unanimity” on the question of annexation is
plainly sheer hypocrisy. Obviously, the French socialists who
defend war over Alsace-Lorraine, and the German socialists who
do not demand freedom for Alsace-Lorraine, for German Poland,
etc., to separate from Germany, and the Russian socialists who
describe the war being waged to return Poland to tsarist bondage
as a war to “save the country”, and who demand that Polish
territory be annexed to Russia in the name of “peace without
annexations” etc., etc., are in fact annexationists. 


To prevent the struggle against annexations from being mere
hypocrisy, or an empty phrase, to make it really educate the
masses in the spirit of internationalism, the question must be
presented in such a way as to open the eyes of the masses to the
fraud in this matter of annexations, instead of covering it
up. It is not enough for the socialists of each country
to pay lip-service to the equality of nations

    

or to orate, swear
and invoke the: name of God to witness their opposition to
annexations, The socialists of every country must demand
immediate and unconditional freedom to
secede for the colonies and nations oppressed by
their own “fatherland”


Without this condition, recognition of the
self-determination of nations and principles of internationalism
would, even in the Zimmerwald Manifesto, remain a dead letter,
at  best.


6. The socialists’ “peace programme”, and their programme of
“struggle to end the war”, must proceed from the exposure of
the lie of the “democratic peace”, the pacific intentions of
the belligerents, etc., now being spread among the
people by demagogic ministers, pacifist bourgeois,
Social-chauvinists, and Kautskyites in all countries, Any
“peace programme” will deceive the people and be a
piece of hypocrisy, unless its principal object is to
explain to the masses the need for a revolution, and to
support, aid, and develop the mass revolutionary
struggles breaking out everywhere (ferment among the masses,
protests, fraternisation in the trenches, strikes,
demonstrations, letters from the front to relatives—for
example, in France—urging them not to subscribe
to war loans, etc., etc,),


It is the duty of socialists to support, extend and intensify,
every popular movement to end the war. But it is
actually being fulfilled only by those socialists who,
like Liebknecht, in their parliamentary speeches, call upon the
soldiers to lay down their arms, and preach revolution and
transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war
for socialism.


The positive slogan we muse put forward to draw the masses into
revolutionary struggle and to explain the necessity for
revolutionary measures to make a “democratic” peace possible, is
that of repudiation  of debts incurred by states.


It is not, enough to hint at revolution, as the Zimmerwald
Manifesto does, by saying that the workers must make sacrifices
for their own and not for someone else’s cause. The masses must
be shown  their road clearly and definitely. They must
know where to go and why, That mass revolutionary actions during
the war, if successfully developed,

    

can lead only to the
transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war for
socialism is obvious, and it is harmful to conceal this
from the masses. On the contrary, this aim must he indicated
clearly, no matter how difficult its attainment may appear now,
while we are still at the beginning of the road. It is not
enough to say, as the Zimmerwald Manifesto does, that “tile
capitalists lie when they speak about defence of the fatherland”
in the present war, and that the workers in their revolutionary
struggle must ignore their country’s military situation; it is
necessary to State clearly what is merely hinted at here,
namely, that not only the capitalists, but also the
social-chauvinists and the Kautskyites lie when they allow the
term “defence of the fatherland” to be applied in the present,
imperialist war and that revolutionary action during the war is
impossible unless “one’s own” government is threatened with
defeat; it must be stated clearly that every defeat, of the
government in a reactionary war facilitates revolution, which
alone is capable of bringing about a lasting and democratic
peace. Finally, the masses must be told that unless they
themselves create illegal organisations and a press that is free
from military censorship, i.e., an illegal press, it will be
quite impossible to render serious support to the incipient
revolutionary struggle, to develop it, to criticise some of its
steps, to correct its errors and systematically to extend and
sharpen it.


7. On the question of socialist parliamentary action, it must he
borne in mind that the Zimmerwald resolution not only
expresses sympathy for the five Social-Democratic deputies in
the State Duma, who belong to our Party, and who have been
sentenced to exile to Siberia, but also expresses
its solidarity with their tactics. It is impossible to
recognise the revolutionary struggle of the masses while
resting content with exclusively legal socialist activity in
parliament. This can only arouse legitimate dissatisfaction
among the workers, cause them to desert Social-Democracy for
anti-parliamentary anarchism or syndicalism. It must be
stated clearly and publicly that Social-Democratic members of
parliament must use their position not only to make
speeches in parliament, but also to render all possible aid
outside parliament to the underground organisation and the

    

revolutionary struggle of the workers, and that the
masses themselves, through their illegal organisation, must
supervise these activities of their leaders.


8. The question of the convocation of the International
Socialist Bureau boils down to a fundamental question of
principle, i.e., whether the old parties and the Second
International can be united. Every step forward taken By the
international labour movement along the road mapped out by
Zimmerwald shows more and more clearly the inconsistency of
the position adopted by the Zimmerwald majority; for, on the
one hand, it identifies the policy of the old parties and of
the Second International with bourgeois policy in
the labour movement, with a policy which does not pursue  the
interests of the proletariat, but of the bourgeoisie (for
example, the statement in the Zimmerwald Manifesto that the
“capitalists” lie when they speak of “defence of the
fatherland” in the present war; also the still more definite
statements contained in the circular of the International
Socialist Committee of February 10,
1916[6]);
on the other hand, the
International Socialist Committee is afraid of a break with
the International Socialist; Bureau and has promised
officially to dissolve when the Bureau
reconvenes.[7]


We state that not only was such a promise never voted on, but it
was never even discussed in Zimmerwald.


The six months since Zimmerwald have proved that actual
work in the spirit of Zimmerwald—not empty phrases but
work—is bound up throughout the world
with the split that is becoming deeper and wider. In
Germany, illegal anti-war leaflets are being printed despite the
Party’s decisions, i.e., schismatically. When Deputy Otto Ruhle,
Karl Liebknecht’s closest friend, said openly that there were
actually two parties in existence, one helping the bourgeoisie,
and the other fighting against it, many, Including the
Kautskyites, reviled him, but no one refuted him. In France,
Bourderon, a member of the Socialist Party, is a determined
opponent of a split, but at the same time he submits a
resolution to his Party disapproving of the Party’s Central
Committee and of the parliamentary group (desapprouver
Comm. Adm. Perm. et Gr. Parl.), which, If adopted,
would certainly have caused an immediate split. In  Britain,
T. Russell

    

Williams, a member of the I.L.P., writing in the
moderate Labour Leader, openly admits that a split is
inevitable and finds support; in letters written by local
functionaries. The example of America is perhaps still more
instructive, because even there, in a neutral country, two
irreconcilably hostile trends in the Socialist Party have become
revealed: on the one hand, the adherents of so-called
“preparedness”,[1]

i.e.,  war,  militarism,  and  navalism,  and
on  the  other, socialists like Eugene Debs, former presidential
candidate from the Socialist Party, who openly preaches civil
war for socialism, precisely in connection with the coming war.


Actually, there is already a split throughout the world; two
entirely irreconcilable working-class policies in relation to
the war have crystallised. We must not close our eyes to this
fact; to do so would only result in confusing the masses of the
workers, in befogging their minds, in hindering the
revolutionary mass struggle with which all Zimmerwaldists
officially sympathise, and in strengthening the influence over
the masses of those leaders whom the International Socialist
Committee, in its circular of February 10, 1916, openly accuses
of “misleading” the masses and of hatching a “plot;”
(Pakt) against socialism.


It is the  social-chauvinists and Kautskyites of all countries
who will undertake the task of restoring the bankrupt
International Socialist Bureau. The task of the socialists is to
explain to the masses the inevitability of a split with those
who pursue a bourgeois policy under the flag of socialism.

The International Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.) was the
permanent executive and information body of the Second
International located at Brussels. It was founded by a decision
taken at the Paris Congress of the Second International
(1900). It consisted of two national delegated from each
national party, and was to meet four times a year, the Executive
Committee of the Belgian Labour Party being charged with its
position between sessions. Vandervelde was its Chairman, and
Huysmans, its Secretary. Lenin was a member of the Bureau, as a
representative of the R.S.D.L.P., form 1905. Form June 1914, on
Lenin’s proposal, M. M. Litvinov was appointed to represent the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee. When the First World War broke out
the I.S.B. became a pliable tool in the hands of the
social-chauvinists.

to restore the Second International.

That was how Sotsial-Demokrat posed the alternative
with regard to the German Social-Democratic Party, back in its
issue
No. 35[1]

,

when it elaborated the fundamental ideas
of the Manifesto on war issued by our Party’s Central
Committee.[2]

Notice how the facts bear out
this conclusion.


The German Social-Democratic Party is clearly
disintegrating. Otto Ruhle, Karl Liebknecht’s closest
associate, quite apart from the I.S.D. group (International
Socialists of
Germany),[3]
which has been consistently
fighting the hypocritical Kautskyites, has openly come
out for a split. Vorwarts had no serious,
honest answer. There are actually two workers’
parties in Germany.


Even in Britain, a statement was made by T. Russell Williams in
the moderate, pacifist Labour Leader (the Central Organ
of the Independent Labour Party), and he was supported by many
local functionaries. Comrade
Ornatsky,[4]
who has done
very good internationalist work in Britain, came out in the
conciliatory Nashe Slovo in Paris for tin immediate
split there. We are naturally in full agreement with
Ornatsky in his polemic with T. Rothstein, a
correspondent of
Kommunist,[5]
who takes a Kautskyite
attitude.


In France, Bourderon is a fervent opponent of any split
but–has proposed to the Party Congress a resolution
calling for outright disapproval both of the Party’s Central
Committee and the parliamentary group! Adoption of such a
resolution would mean an immediate split in the Party.

 

In America, the Socialist Party appears to be united. Actually,
some of its members, like Russell and others, preach
“preparedness”, stand for war, and want an army and
navy. Others, like Eugene Debs, the Party’s presidential
candidate, openly preach civil war “in the event” of an
imperialist war, rather, in connection with one.


There are now actually two parties all over the world. There are
in fact already two Internationals. And if the Zimmerwald
majority are afraid to recognise this, if they dream of unity
with  the social-chauvinists, and declare their readiness to
have such unity, these “pious hopes” in practice remain nothing
but hopes, expressive of inconsistency and timidity of thought,
Consciousness lags behind reality.

A group of German Left-wing Social-Democrats which emerged
during the First World War. Its organ, Lichtstrahlen
(Rays of Light), was published in Berlin from 1913 to
1921. The I.S.D. openly opposed war and opportunism and took the
most consistent stand in Germany on separation from the
social-chauvinists and Centrists. Borchardt, representing the
group at the Zimmerwald Conference, alone of the 10 German
delegates signed the draft resolution and draft manifesto of the
Zimmerwald Left. Soon after the conference, the Bureau of the
Zimmerwald Left was informed that the I.S.D. group had joined
it, and this was reported in Internationale Flugblatt
(International Leaflets) No. 1. The group had no extensive ties
with the masses and soon broke up.

[5]

A magazine founded by Lenin and published
by the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat jointly with
G. L. Pyatakov and E. B. Bosch, who financed it; Bukharin was one
of the editorsss. Only one (double) issue was published. It
carried, apart from the article “The Honest Voice of a French
Socialist”, two other articles by Lenin: “The Collapse of the
Second International” and “Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”.


The publication plan was worked out by Lenin in the spring of
1915. The organisational meeting of the editorial board was held
under his guidance. Lenin planned to make Kommunist an
international organ of the Left-wing Social-Democrats, but it
soon transpired that there were grave contradictions between the
Editorial Board and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosch, which were
aggravated after the No. 1-2 issue. The Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosch
took an incorrect stand on a number of points of principle in
the Party’s Programme and tactics-the right of nations to
self-determination, the role of democratic demands and the
minimum programme in general, etc.-and tried to make use of the
magazine for factional purposes. On the Editorial Board Lenin
fought the Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosch group, exposed their
anti-Bolshevik views and factional activites, and sharply
criticised the concilatory attitude to the group on the part of
G. Y. Zinoviev and A. G. Shlyapnikov.


In view of the groups anti-Party attitude, the
Sotsial-Demokrat Editorial Board declared, on Lenin’s
proposal, that it considered it impossible to continue
publication. Lenin wrote the draft resolution of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee terminating the publication of the
Kommunist. The Central Committee Bureau in Russia,
having heard a report on the contradictions on the
Kommunist Editorial Board, declared its full solidarity
with the Editorial Board of the Central Organ,
Sotsial-Demokrat, ad expressed the wish that “all
publications of the Central Committee should be edited on lines
strictly in conformity with the Central Committee’s policy and
adopted before the outbreak of the war”. From October 1916, the
Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat began publication
of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.

The German Chauvinists, as we know, have succeeded in imposing
their influence upon the overwhelming majority of leaders of the
so-called Social-Democratic-now, in fact, National-Liberal
Party. We shall see presently how far this applies to the
non-German chauvinists like Postresov, Levitsky and Co. At the
moment we must deal with the German chauvinists, among whom, in
fairness, Kautsky must also be included, notwithstanding the
fact that P. B. Axelrod, in his German pamphlet, for example,
very assiduously and very incorrectly defends Kautsky and calls
him an “internationalist”.


One of the characteristics of German chauvinism is that
“socialists”-socialists in quotation marks-talk about
the independence of nations, except those which are oppressed by
their own nation. It does not make much difference whether so
directly, or whether they defend, justify and shield those who
say it.


The German chauvinists (who include Parvus, the publisher of a
little magazine, called Die Glocke, among whose
contributors are Lensch, Haenisch, Grunwald all the rest of the
crew of “socialist” lackeys of German imperialist
bourgeoisie) speak at great length and very eagerly, for
example, about the independence for the peoples oppressed by
Britain. It is not only the social-chauvinists of Germany, i.e.,
socialists in words, chauvinists in deeds, but the whole
bourgeoisie press of Germany that is trumpeting with all its
might about the shameful, brutal and reactionary, etc., fashion
in which Britain rules her colonies. The German papers write
about the liberation movement in India with great gusto,
malicious glee, delight and rapture.

 

It is easy to see why the German Bourgeoisie is full of
malicious joy: it hope to improve its military position by
fanning the discontent in the anti-British movement India. These
hopes are silly, of course, because it is simply impossible
seriously to entertaining the influencing the life of a
multi-million people, and a very peculiar people at that, from
outside, from afar in a foreign language, particular when the
influence is not systematic, but casual, only for the duration
of the war. Rather than the desire to influence India the
efforts of the German imperialist bourgeoisie are more of an
attempt at self-consolation, more of a desire to fool the German
people and to divert their attention from home to foreign parts.


But this general, theoretical question automatically arises:
What is at the root of the falsehood of such arguments; how can
the hypocrisy of the German imperialists be exposed without
unerring certainty? The correct theoretical answer pointing to
the root of falsehood always serves as a means of exposing the
hypocrites who, for reasons all too obvious, are inclined to
cover up their falsehood, to obscure it, to clothe it in flowery
phrases, all sorts of phrases, phrases about everything in the
world, even about internationalism. Even the Lensches, Südekums
and Scheidmanns, all these agents of the German bourgeoisie,
who, unfortunately, belong to the so-called “Social-Democratic”
Party of Germany, insist that they are internationalists. Men
must not be judged by their words, however, but by their
deeds. This is a home truth. Will anyone in Russia judge
Potresov, Levitsky, Bulkin and Co. by their words? Of course,
not.


The falsehood of the German chauvinists has its roots in their
shouting their sympathy for the independence of the peoples
oppressed by Britain, their enemy in the war, and modestly,
sometimes much too modestly, keeping silent about the
independence of the peoples oppressed by their own
nation.


Take the Danes. When Prussia annexed Schleswig she also seized,
as all “Great” Powers are wont to do, a part inhabited by
Danes. The violation of the rights of this population was so
patent that that when Austria ceded to Prussia her “rights” to
Schleswig under the Peace of Prague, August 23-30, 1866, the
treaty stipulated that the population of the

    

northern part of
the province was to be asked in a plebiscite whether they wished
to join Denmark are were to be joined to Denmark in the event of
a vote to that effect. This condition, however, was not
fulfilled by Prussia who, in 1871, had this “unpleasant” clause
deleted.


Frederick Engels, who was never indifferent to the chauvinism of
Great-Power nations, specifically pointed to this violation of
the rights of a small nation by
Prussia.[2] But the
present-day social-chauvinists, while recognising the right of
self-determination of nations in words, as Kautsky also does,
have never carried on any consistently-democratic and resolutely
democratic agitation in favour of liberating an oppressed nation
when that oppression was exercised nation was “their own”
nation. That is the whole secret, the kernel, of the question of
chauvinism and of its exposure.


A once popular pun in Russia was that Russkoye Znamya
frequently behaved like Prusskoye
Znamya.[3]
But this does not apply to Russkoye Znamya alone; for
Potresov, Levitsky and Co. reason in the Russian in the very
same way as Lensch, Kautsky and Co. reason in Germany. Take a
look in the liquidationist Rabocheye Utro, for example,
and you will find similar “Prussian”, or rather,
international-chauvinist arguments and methods of
reasoning. Chauvinism remains true to itself, whatever its
national brand, whatever its pacifist cover-up phrase.

Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: PREFACE








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE







PREFACE

The pamphlet here presented to the reader was written in the
      spring of 1916, in Zurich. In the conditions in which I was
      obliged to work there I naturally suffered somewhat from a
      shortage of French and English literature and from a serious
      dearth of Russian literature. However, I made use of the
      principal English work on imperialism, the book by J. A. Hobson,
      with all the care that, in my opinion, that work deserves.


This pamphlet was written with an eye to the tsarist
      censorship. Hence, I was not only forced to confine myself
      strictly to an exclusively theoretical, specifically economic
      analysis of facts, but to formulate the few necessary
      observations on politics with extreme caution, by hints, in an
      allegorical language—in that accursed Aesopian language—to 
  which tsarism compelled all revolutionaries to have
      recourse whenever they took up the pen to write a “legal”
      work.


It is painful, in these days of liberty, to re-read the
      passages of the pamphlet which have been distorted, cramped,
      compressed in an iron vice on account of the censor. That the
      period of imperialism is the eve of the socialist revolution;
      that social-chauvinism (socialism in words, chauvinism in deeds)
      is the utter betrayal of socialism, complete desertion to the
      side of the bourgeoisie; that this split in the working-class
      movement is bound up with the objective conditions of
      imperialism, etc.—on these matters I had to speak in a
      “slavish” tongue, and I must refer the reader who is interested
      in the subject to the articles I wrote abroad in 1914-17, a new
      edition of which is soon to appear. In order to show the reader,
      in a guise acceptable to the

 

censors, how shamelessly untruthful
      the capitalists and the social-chauvinists who have deserted to
      their side (and whom Kautsky opposes so inconsistently) are on
      the question of annexations; in order to show how shamelessly
      they screen the annexations of their
      capitalists, I was forced to quote as an example—Japan!
      The careful reader will easily substitute Russia for Japan, and
      Finland, Poland, Courland, the Ukraine, Khiva, Bokhara, Estonia
      or other regions peopled by non-Great Russians, for Korea.


I trust that this pamphlet will help the reader to understand
      the fundamental economic question, that of the economic essence
      of imperialism, for unless this is studied, it will be
      impossible to understand and appraise modern war and modern
      politics.

Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: PREFACE TO THE FRENCH AND GERMAN EDITIONS








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



PREFACE TO THE FRENCH AND GERMAN
EDITIONS[1]
I

As was indicated in the preface to the Russian edition, this
      pamphlet was written in 1916, with an eye to the tsarist
      censorship. I am unable to revise the whole text at the present
      time, nor, perhaps, would this be advisable, since the main
      purpose of the book was, and remains, to present, on the basis
      of the summarised returns of irrefutable bourgeois statistics,
      and the admissions of bourgeois scholars of all countries, a
      composite picture of the world capitalist system in its
      international relationships at the beginning of the twentieth
      century—on the eve of the first world imperialist
      war.


To a certain extent it will even be useful for many Communists
      in advanced capitalist countries to convince themselves by the
      example of this pamphlet, legal from the standpoint of the
      tsarist censor, of the possibility, and necessity, of making use
      of even the slight remnants of legality which still remain at
      the disposal of the Communists, say, in contemporary America or
      France, after the recent almost wholesale arrests of Communists,
      in order to explain the utter falsity of social-pacifist views
      and hopes for “world democracy”. The most essential of what
      should be added to this censored pamphlet I shall try to present
      in this preface.

II

It is proved in the pamphlet that the war of 1914-18 was
      imperialist (that is, an annexationist, predatory war of
      plunder) on the part of both sides; it was a war for the

 

division of the world, for the partition and repartition of
      colonies and spheres of influence of finance capital, etc.


Proof of what was the true social, or rather, the true class
      character of the war is naturally to be found, not in the
      diplomatic history of the war, but in an analysis of the
      objective position of the ruling classes in
      all the belligerent countries. In order to depict this
      objective position one must not take examples or isolated data
      (in view of the extreme complexity of the phenomena of social
      life it is always possible to select any number of examples or
      separate data to prove any proposition), but all the
      data on the basis of economic life in all the
      belligerent countries and the whole world.


It is precisely irrefutable summarised data of this kind that I
      quoted in describing the partition of the world in 1876
      and 1914 (in Chapter VI) and the division of the world’s
      railways in 1890 and 1913 (in Chapter VII). Railways
      are a summation of the basic capitalist industries, coal, iron
      and steel; a summation and the most striking index of the
      development of world trade and bourgeois-democratic
      civilisation. How the railways are linked up with large-scale
      industry, with monopolies, syndicates, cartels, trusts, banks
      and the financial oligarchy is shown in the preceding chapters
      of the book. The uneven distribution of the railways, their
      uneven development—sums up, as it were, modern monopolist
      capitalism on a world-wide scale. And this summary proves that
      imperialist wars are absolutely inevitable under such
      an economic system, as long as private property in the
      means of production exists.


The building of railways seems to be a simple, natural,
      democratic, cultural and civilising enterprise; that is what it
      is in the opinion of the bourgeois professors who are paid to
      depict capitalist slavery in bright colours, and in the opinion
      of petty-bourgeois philistines. But as a matter of fact the
      capitalist threads, which in thousands of different
      intercrossings bind these enterprises with private property in
      the means of production in general, have converted this railway
      construction into an instrument for oppressing a thousand
      million people (in the colonies and semicolonies), that is,
      more than half the population of the globe that inhabits the
      dependent countries, as well as the wage-slaves of capital in
      the “civilised” countries.



Private property based on the labour of the small proprietor,
      free competition, democracy, all the catchwords with which the
      capitalists and their press deceive the workers and the
      peasants are things of the distant past. Capitalism has grown
      into a world system of colonial oppression and of the financial
      strangulation of the overwhelming majority of the population of
      the world by a handful of “advanced” countries. And this “booty”
      is shared between two or three powerful world plunderers armed
      to the teeth (America, Great Britain, Japan), who are drawing
      the whole world into their war over the division of
      their booty.

III

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk dictated by monarchist Germany, and
      the subsequent much more brutal and despicable Treaty of
      Versailles dictated by the “democratic” republics of America and
      France and also by “free” Britain, have rendered a most useful
      service to humanity by exposing both imperialism’s hired coolies
      of the pen and petty-bourgeois reactionaries who, although they
      call themselves pacifists and socialists, sang praises to
      “Wilsonism,” and insisted that peace and reforms were possible
      under imperialism.


The tens of millions of dead and maimed left by the war—a
      war to decide whether the British or German group of financial
      plunderers is to receive the most booty—and those two
      “peace treaties,” are with unprecedented rapidity opening the
      eyes of the millions and tens of millions of people who are
      downtrodden, oppressed, deceived and duped by the
      bourgeoisie. Thus, out of the universal ruin caused by the war a
      world-wide revolutionary crisis is arising which, however
      prolonged and arduous its stages may be, cannot end otherwise
      than in a proletarian revolution and in its victory.


The Basle Manifesto of the Second International, which in 1912
      gave an appraisal of the very war that broke out in 1914 and not
      of war in general (there are different kinds of wars, including
      revolutionary wars)—this Manifesto is now a monument
      exposing to the full the shameful bankruptcy and treachery of
      the heroes of the Second International.


That is why I reproduce this Manifesto (This Manifesto is not given as an appendix to
this edition—Ed) as a supplement to the present
edition, and again and again I urge the reader

 

to note that
the heroes of the Second International are as assiduously
avoiding the passages of this Manifesto which speak precisely,
clearly and definitely of the connection between that
impending war and the proletarian revolution, as a thief
avoids the scene of his crime.

IV

Special attention has been devoted in this pamphlet to a
      criticism of Kautskyism, the international ideological trend
      represented in all countries of the world by the “most prominent
      theoreticians,” the leaders of the Second International (Otto
      Bauer and Co. in Austria, Ramsay MacDonald and others in
      Britain, Albert Thomas in France, etc., etc.) and a multitude of
      socialists, reformists, pacifists, bourgeois democrats and
      parsons.


This ideological trend is, on the one hand, a product of the
      disintegration and decay of the Second International, and, on
      the other hand, the inevitable fruit of the ideology of the
      petty bourgeoisie, whose entire way of life holds them captive
      to bourgeois and democratic prejudices.


The views held by Kautsky and his like are a complete
      renunciation of those same revolutionary principles of Marxism
      that writer has championed for decades, especially, by the way,
      in his struggle against socialist opportunism (of Bernstein,
      Millerand, Hyndman, Gompers, etc.). It is not a mere accident,
      therefore, that Kautsky’s followers all over the world have now
      united in practical politics with the extreme opportunists
      (through the Second, or Yellow International) and with the
      bourgeois governments (through bourgeois coalition governments
      in which socialists take part).


The growing world proletarian revolutionary movement in
      general, and the communist movement in particular, cannot
      dispense with an analysis and exposure of the theoretical errors
      of Kautskyism. The more so since pacifism and “democracy” in
      general, which lay no claim to Marxism whatever, but which, like
      Kautsky and Co., are obscuring the profundity of the
      contradictions of imperialism and the inevitable revolutionary
      crisis to which it gives rise, are

 

still very widespread all
      over the world. To combat these tendencies is the bounden duty
      of the party of the proletariat, which must win away from the
      bourgeoisie the small proprietors who are duped by them, and the
      millions of working people who enjoy more or less
      petty-bourgeois conditions of life.

V

A few words must be said about Chapter VIII, “Parasitism and
      Decay of Capitalism.” As already pointed out in the text,
      Hilferding, ex-“Marxist,” and now a comrade-in-arms of Kautsky
      and one of the chief exponents of bourgeois, reformist policy in
      the 
      Independent Social-Democratic Party of
Germany,[2] has taken a
      step backward on this question compared with the
      frankly pacifist and reformist Englishman, Hobson. The
      international split of the entire working-class movement is now
      quite evident (the Second and the Third Internationals). The
      fact that armed struggle and civil war is now raging between the
      two trends is also evident—the support given to Kolchak
      and Denikin in Russia by the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries against the Bolsheviks; the fight the
      Scheidemanns and Noskes have conducted in conjunction with the
      bourgeoisie against the Spartacists[3] 
  in Germany; the same thing in Finland, Poland,
      Hungary, etc. What is the economic basis of this
      world-historical phenomenon?


It is precisely the parasitism and decay of capitalism,
      characteristic of its highest historical stage of development,
      i.e., imperialism. As this pamphlet shows, capitalism has now
      singled out a handful (less than one-tenth of the
      inhabitants of the globe; less than one-fifth at a most
      “generous” and liberal calculation) of exceptionally rich and
      powerful states which plunder the whole world simply by
      “clipping coupons.” Capital exports yield an income of eight to
      ten thousand million francs per annum, at pre-war prices and
      according to pre-war bourgeois statistics. Now, of course, they
      yield much more.


Obviously, out of such enormous superprofits (since
      they are obtained over and above the profits which capitalists
      squeeze out of the workers of their “own” country) it is


possible to bribe the labour leaders and the upper
      stratum of the labour aristocracy. And that is just what the
      capitalists of the “advanced” countries are doing: they are
      bribing them in a thousand different ways, direct and indirect,
      overt and covert.


This stratum of workers-turned-bourgeois, or the labour
      aristocracy, who are quite philistine in their mode of life, in
      the size of their earnings and in their entire outlook, is the
      principal prop of the Second International, and in our days, the
      principal social (not military) prop of the
      bourgeoisie. For they are the real agents of the
      bourgeoisie in the working-class movement, the labour
      lieutenants of the capitalist class, real vehicles of reformism
      and chauvinism. In the civil war between the proletariat and the
      bourgeoisie they inevitably, and in no small numbers, take the
      side of the bourgeoisie, the “Versaillese” against the
      “Communards.”


Unless the economic roots of this phenomenon are understood and
      its political and social significance is appreciated, not a step
      can be taken toward the solution of the practical problem of the
      communist movement and of the impending social revolution.


Imperialism is the eve of the social revolution of the
      proletariat. This has been confirmed since 1917 on a world-wide
      scale.

N. Lenin 


July 6, 1920





      During the last fifteen to twenty years, especially since the
      Spanish-American War (1898) and the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902),
      the economic and also the political literature of the two
      hemispheres has more and more often adopted the term “imperialism”
    in order to describe the present era. In 1902, a book by the
    English economist J. A. Hobson, Imperialism, was
    published in London and New York. This author, whose point of view
    is that of bourgeois social-reformism and pacifism which, in
    essence, is identical with the present point of view of the
    ex-Marxist, Karl Kautsky, gives a very good and comprehensive
    description of the principal specific economic and political
    features of imperialism. In 1910, there appeared in Vienna the
    work of the Austrian Marxist, Rudolf Hilferding, Finance
    Capital (Russian edition, Moscow, 1912). In spite of the
    mistake the author makes on the theory of money, and in spite of a
    certain inclination on his part to reconcile Marxism with
    opportunism, this work gives a very valuable theoretical analysis
    of “the latest phase of capitalist development,” as the subtitle
    runs. Indeed, what has been said of imperialism during the last
    few years, especially in an enormous number of magazine and
    newspaper articles, and also in the resolutions, for example, of
    the 
    Chemnitz and Basle congresses which took place in the autumn
    of 1912, has scarcely gone beyond the ideas expounded, or more
    exactly, summed up by the two writers mentioned above...


Later on, I shall try to show briefly, and as simply as
    possible, the connection and relationships between the
    principal economic features of imperialism. I shall not
    be able to deal with the non-economic aspects of the question,

 

however much they deserve to be dealt with. References to
    literature and other notes which, perhaps, would not interest all
    readers, are to be found at the end of this
pamphlet.[4]

Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: I. CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION AND MONOPOLIES








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE

I. CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION AND MONOPOLIES

The enormous growth of industry and the remarkably rapid
    concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of
    the most characteristic features of capitalism. Modern production
    censuses give most complete and most exact data on this
    process.


In Germany, for example, out of every 1,000 industrial
    enterprises, large enterprises, i.e., those employing more than 50
    workers, numbered three in 1882, six in 1895 and nine in 1907; and
    out of every 100 workers employed, this group of enterprises
    employed 22, 30 and 37, respectively. Concentration of
    production, however, is much more intense than the concentration
    of workers, since labour in the large enterprises is much more
    productive. This is shown by the figures on steam-engines and
    electric motors. If we take what in Germany is called industry in
    the broad sense of the term, that is, including commerce,
    transport, etc., we get the following picture. Large-scale
    enterprises, 30,588 out of a total of 3,265,623, that is to say,
    0.9 per cent. These enterprises employ 5,700,000 workers out of a
    total of 14,400,000, i.e., 39.4 per cent; they use 6,600,000 steam
    horse power out of a total of 8,800,000, i.e., 75.3 per cent, and
    1,200,000 kilowatts of electricity out of a total of 1,500,000,
    i.e., 77.2 per cent.


Less than one-hundredth of the total number of enterprises
    utilise more than three-fourths of the total amount of
    steam and electric power! Two million nine hundred and seventy
    thousand small enterprises (employing up to five workers),
    constituting 91 per cent of the total, utilise only 7 per cent of
    the total amount of steam and electric power! Tens of thousands of
    huge enterprises are everything; millions of small ones are
    nothing.


In 1907, there were in Germany 586 establishments employing one
    thousand and more workers, nearly one-tenth
  

(1,380,000)
    of the total number of workers employed in industry, and they
    consumed almost one-third (32 per cent) of the total
    amount of steam and electric
power.[1]

As we shall see, money capital and the
    banks make this superiority of a handful of the largest
    enterprises still more overwhelming, in the most literal sense of
    the word, i.e., millions of small, medium and even some big
    “proprietors” are in fact in complete subjection to some hundreds
    of millionaire financiers.


In another advanced country of modern capitalism, the United
    States of America, the growth of the concentration of production
    is still greater. Here statistics single out industry in the
    narrow sense of the word and classify enterprises according to the
    value of their annual output. In 1904 large-scale enterprises with
    an output valued at one million dollars and over, numbered 1,900
    (out of 216,180, i.e., 0.9 per cent). These employed 1,400,000
    workers (out of 5,500,000, i.e., 25.6 per cent) and the value of
    their output amounted to $5,600,000,000 (out of $14,800,000,000,
    i.e., 38 per cent). Five years later, in 1909, the corresponding
    figures were: 3,060 enterprises (out of 268,491, i.e., 1.1 per
    cent) employing 2,000,000 workers (out of 6,600,000, i.e., 30.5
    per cent) with an output valued at $9,000,000,000 (out of
    $20,700,000,000, i.e., 43.8
per cent). [2]


Almost half the total production of all the enterprises of the
    country was carried on by one-hundredth part of these
    enterprises! These 3,000 giant enterprises embrace 258 branches of
    industry. From this it can be seen that at a certain stage of its
    development concentration itself, as it were, leads straight to
    monopoly, for a score or so of giant enterprises can easily arrive
    at an agreement, and on the other hand, the hindrance to
    competition, the tendency towards monopoly, arises from the huge
    size of the enterprises. This transformation of competition into
    monopoly is one of the most important—if not the most
    important—phenomena of modern capitalist economy, and we
    must deal with it in greater detail. But first we must clear up
    one possible misunderstanding.



American statistics speak of 3,000 giant enterprises in 250
    branches of industry, as if there were only a dozen enterprises of
    the largest scale for each branch of industry.


But this is not the case. Not in every branch of industry are
    there large-scale enterprises; and moreover, a very important
    feature of capitalism in its highest stage of development is
    so-called combination of production, that is to say, the
    grouping in a single enterprise of different branches of industry,
    which either represent the consecutive stages in the processing of
    raw materials (for example, the smelting of iron ore into
    pig-iron, the conversion of pig-iron into steel, and then,
    perhaps, the manufacture of steel goods)—or are auxiliary
    to one another (for example, the utilisation of scrap, or of
    by-products, the manufacture of packing materials, etc.).


“Combination,” writes Hilferding, “levels out the fluctuations
    of trade and therefore assures to the combined enterprises a more
    stable rate of profit. Secondly, combination has the effect of
    eliminating trade. Thirdly, it has the effect of rendering
    possible technical improvements, and, consequently, the
    acquisition of superprofits over and above those obtained by the
    ‘pure’ (i.e,, non-combined) enterprises. Fourthly, it strengthens
    the position of the combined enterprises relative to the ‘pure’
    enterprises, strengthens them in the competitive struggle in
    periods of serious depression, when the fall in prices of raw
    materials does not keep pace with the fall in prices of
    manufactured
goods.”[3]


The German bourgeois economist, Heymann, who has written a book
    especially on “mixed,” that is, combined, enterprises in the
    German iron industry, says: “Pure enterprises perish, they are
    crushed between the high price of raw material and the low price
    of the finished product.” Thus we get the following picture:
    “There remain, on the one hand, the big coal companies, producing
    millions of tons yearly, strongly organised in their coal
    syndicate, and on the other, the big steel plants, closely allied
    to the coal mines, having their own steel syndicate. These giant
    enterprises, producing 400,000 tons of steel per annum, with a
    tremendous output of ore and coal and producing finished steel
    goods, employing

 

10,000 workers quartered in company houses, and
    sometimes owning their own railways and ports, are the typical
    representatives of the German iron and steel industry. And
    concentration goes on further and further. Individual enterprises
    are becoming larger and larger. An ever-increasing number of
    enterprises in one, or in several different industries, join
    together in giant enterprises, backed up and directed by half a
    dozen big Berlin banks. In relation to the German mining industry,
    the truth of the teachings of Karl Marx on concentration is
    definitely proved; true, this applies to a country where industry
    is protected by tariffs and freight rates. The German mining
    industry is ripe for
expropriation.”[4]


Such is the conclusion which a bourgeois economist who, by way
    of exception, is conscientious, had to arrive at. It must be noted
    that he seems to place Germany in a special category because her
    industries are protected by higher tariffs. But this is a
    circumstance which only accelerates concentration and the
    formation of monopolist manufacturers’ associations, cartels,
    syndicates, etc. It is extremely important to note that in
    free-trade Britain, concentration also leads to monopoly, although
    somewhat later and perhaps in another form. Professor Hermann
    Levy, in his special work of research entitled Monopolies,
    Cartels and Trusts, based on data on British economic
    development, writes as follows:


“In Great Britain it is the size of the enterprise and its high
    technical level which harbour a monopolist tendency. This, for one
    thing, is due to the great investment of capital per enterprise,
    which gives rise to increasing demands for new capital for the new
    enterprises and thereby renders their launching more
    difficult. Moreover (and this seems to us to be the more important
    point), every new enterprise that wants to keep pace with the
    gigantic enterprises that have been formed by concentration would
    here produce such an enormous quantity of surplus goods that it
    could dispose of them only by being able to sell them profitably
    as a result of an enormous increase in demand; otherwise, this
    surplus

  

would force prices down to a level that would be
    unprofitable both for the new enterprise and for the monopoly
    combines.” Britain differs from other countries where protective
    tariffs facilitate the formation of cartels in that monopolist
    manufacturers’ associations, cartels and trusts arise in the
    majority of cases only when the number of the chief competing
    enterprises has been reduced to “a couple of dozen or so.” “Here
    the influence of concentration on the formation of large
    industrial monopolies in a whole sphere of industry stands out
    with crystal
clarity.”[5]


Half a century ago, when Marx was writing Capital,
    free competition appeared to the overwhelming majority of
    economists to be a “natural law”. Official science tried, by a
    conspiracy of silence, to kill the works of Marx, who by a
    theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism had proved that
    free competition gives rise to the concentration of production,
    which, in turn, at a certain stage of development, leads to
    monopoly. Today, monopoly has become a fact. Economists are
    writing mountains of books in which they describe the diverse
    manifestations of monopoly, and continue to declare in chorus that
    “Marxism is refuted.” But facts are stubborn things, as the
    English proverb says, and they have to be reckoned with, whether
    we like it or not. The facts show that differences between
    capitalist countries, e.g., in the matter of protection or free
    trade, only give rise to insignificant variations in the form of
    monopolies or in the moment of their appearance; and that the rise
    of monopolies, as the result of the concentration of production,
    is a general and fundamental law of the present stage of
    development of capitalism.


For Europe, the time when the new capitalism definitely
    superseded the old can be established with fair precision; it
    was the beginning of the twentieth century. In one of the latest
    compilations on the history of the “formation of monopolies”, we
    read:


“Isolated examples of capitalist monopoly could be cited from
    the period preceding 1860; in these could be discerned the embryo
    of the forms that are so common today; but

  

all this undoubtedly
    represents the prehistory of the cartels. The real beginning of
    modern monopoly goes back, at the earliest, to the sixties. The
    first important period of development of monopoly commenced with
    the international industrial depression of the seventies and
    lasted until the beginning of the nineties.” “If we examine the
    question on a European scale, we will find that the development of
    free competition reached its apex in the sixties and seventies. It
    was then that Britain completed the construction of her old-style
    capitalist organisation. In Germany, this organisation had entered
    into a fierce struggle with handicraft and domestic industry, and
    had begun to create for itself its own forms of existence.”


“The great revolution commenced with the crash of 1873, or
    rather, the depression which followed it and which, with hardly
    discernible interruptions in the early eighties, and the unusually
    violent, but short-lived boom round about 1889, marks twenty-two
    years of European economic history ... .. During the short boom of
    1889-90, the system of cartels was widely resorted to in order to
    take advantage of favourable business conditions. An
    ill-considered policy drove prices up still more rapidly and still
    higher than would have been the case if there had been no
    cartels, and nearly all these cartels perished ingloriously in the
    smash. Another five-year period of bad trade and low prices
    followed, but a new spirit reigned in industry; the depression was
    no longer regarded as something to be taken for granted: it was
    regarded as nothing more than a pause before another boom.


“The cartel movement entered its second epoch: instead of being
    a transitory phenomenon, the cartels have become one of the
    foundations of economic life. They are winning one field of
    industry after another, primarily, the raw materials industry. At
    the beginning of the nineties the cartel system had already
    acquired in the organisation of the coke syndicate on the model of
    which the coal syndicate was later formed—a cartel
    technique which has hardly been improved on. For the first time
    the great boom at the close of the nineteenth century and the
    crisis of 1900-03 occurred entirely—in the mining and iron
    industries at least—under the aegis of the cartels. And
    while at that time it appeared to be something novel, now the
    general public takes it for

 

granted that large spheres of economic
    life have been, as a general rule, removed from the realm of free
    competition.”[6]


Thus, the principal stages in the history of monopolies are the
    following: (1) 1860-70, the highest stage, the apex of development
    of free competition; monopoly is in the barely discernible,
    embryonic stage. (2) After the crisis of 1873, a lengthy period of
    development of cartels; but they are still the exception. They are
    not yet durable. They are still a transitory phenomenon. (3) The
    boom at the end of the nineteenth century and the crisis of
    1900-03. Cartels become one of the foundations of the whole of
    economic life. Capitalism has been transformed into
    imperialism.


Cartels come to an agreement on the terms of sale, dates of
    payment, etc. They divide the markets among themselves. They fix
    the quantity of goods to be produced. They fix prices. They divide
    the profits among the various enterprises, etc.


The number of cartels in Germany was estimated at about 250 in
    1896 and at 385 in 1905, with about 12,000 firms
participating.[7]

But it is
    generally recognised that these figures are underestimations. From
    the statistics of German industry for 1907 we quoted above, it is
    evident that even these 12,000 very big enterprises probably
    consume more than half the steam and electric power used in the
    country. In the United States of America, the number of trusts in
    1900 was estimated at 185 and in 1907, 250. American statistics
    divide all industrial enterprises into those belonging to
    individuals, to private firms or to corporations. The latter in
    1904 comprised 23.6 per cent, and in 1909, 25.9 per cent, i.e.,
    more than one-fourth of the total industrial enterprises in the
    country. These employed in 1904, 70.6 per cent, and in 1909, 75.6
    per cent, i.e., more than three-fourths

 

of the total
    wage-earners. Their output at these two dates was valued at
    $10,900,000,000 and $16,300,000,000, i.e., 73.7 per cent and 79.0
    per cent of the total, respectively.


At times cartels and trusts concentrate in their hands seven-
    or eight-tenths of the total output of a given branch of
    industry. The Rhine-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, at its foundation
    in 1893, concentrated 86.7 per cent of the total coal output of
    the area, and in 1910 it already concentrated 95.4
per cent.[8]

The monopoly
    so created assures enormous profits, and leads to the formation of
    technical production units of formidable magnitude. The famous
    Standard Oil Company in the United States was founded in 1900: “It
    has an authorised capital of $150,000,000. It issued $100,000,000
    common and $106,000,000 preferred stock. From 1900 to 1907 the
    following dividends were paid on the latter: 48, 48, 45, 44, 36,
    40, 40, 40 per cent in the respective years, i.e., in all,
    $367,000,000. From 1882 to 1907, out of total net profits
    amounting to $889,000,000, $606,000,000 were distributed in
    dividends, and the rest went to reserve
capital.[9]

“In 1907 the various
    works of the United States Steel Corporation employed no less than
    210,180 people. The largest enterprise in the German mining
    industry, Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksgesellschaft, in 1908 had a
    staff of 46,048 workers and office
employees.”[10]

In 1902, the United
    States Steel Corporation already produced 9,000,000 tons of
steel.[11]

    Its output constituted in 1901, 66.3 per cent, and in 1908, 56.1
    per cent of the total output of steel in the United
States.[12]

The
    output of ore was 43.9 per cent and 46.3 per cent,
    respectively.


The report of the American Government Commission on Trusts
    states: “Their superiority over competitors is due

 

to the
    magnitude of their enterprises and their excellent technical
    equipment. Since its inception, the Tobacco Trust has devoted all
    its efforts to the universal substitution of mechanical for manual
    labour. With this end in view it has bought up all patents that
    have anything to do with the manufacture of tobacco and has spent
    enormous sums for this purpose. Many of these patents at first
    proved to be of no use, and had to be modified by the engineers
    employed by the trust. At the end of 1906, two subsidiary
    companies were formed solely to acquire patents. With the same
    object in view, the trust has built its own foundries, machine
    shops and repair shops. One of these establishments, that in
    Brooklyn, employs on the average 300 workers; here experiments are
    carried out on inventions concerning the manufacture of
    cigarettes, cheroots, snuff, tinfoil for packing, boxes,
    etc. Here, also, inventions are
perfected.”[13]

“Other trusts also
    employ what are called development engineers whose business it is
    to devise new methods of production and to test technical
    improvements. The United States Steel Corporation grants big
    bonuses to its workers and engineers for all inventions that raise
    technical efficiency, or reduce cost of
production.”[14]


In German large-scale industry, e.g., in the chemical industry,
    which has developed so enormously during these last few decades,
    the promotion of technical improvement is organised in the same
    way. By 1908 the process of concentration of production had
    already given rise to two main “groups” which, in their way, were
    also in the nature of monopolies. At first these groups
    constituted “dual alliances” of two pairs of big factories, each
    having a capital of from twenty to twenty-one million marks on the
    one hand, the former Meister Factory in Hochst and the Casella
    Factory in Frankfurt am Main; and on the other hand, the aniline
    and soda factory at Ludwigshafen and the former Bayer Factory at
    Elberfeld. Then, in 1905, one of these groups, and in 1908 the
    other group, each concluded an

 

agreement with yet another big
    factory. The result was the formation of two “triple alliances,”
    each with a capital of from forty to fifty million marks. And
    these “alliances” have already begun to “approach” each other, to
    reach “an understanding” about prices,
etc.[15]


Competition becomes transformed into monopoly. The result is
    immense progress in the socialisation of production. In
    particular, the process of technical invention and improvement
    becomes socialised.


This is something quite different from the old free competition
    between manufacturers, scattered and out of touch with one
    another, and producing for an unknown market. Concentration has
    reached the point at which it is possible to make an approximate
    estimate of all sources of raw materials (for example, the iron
    ore deposits) of a country and even, as we shall see, of several
    countries, or of the whole world. Not only are such estimates
    made, but these sources are captured by gigantic monopolist
    associations. An approximate estimate of the capacity of markets
    is also made, and the associations “divide” them up amongst
    themselves by agreement. Skilled labour is monopolised, the best
    engineers are engaged; the means of transport are captured—railways in America, shipping companies in Europe and
    America. Capitalism in its imperialist stage leads directly to the
    most comprehensive socialisation of production; it, so to speak,
    drags the capitalists, against their will and consciousness, into
    some sort of a new social order, a transitional one from complete
    free competition to complete socialisation.


Production becomes social, but appropriation remains
    private. The social means of production remain the private
    property of a few. The general framework of formally recognised
    free competition remains, and the yoke of a few monopolists on the
    rest of the population becomes a hundred times heavier, more
    burdensome and intolerable.


The German economist, Kestner, has written a book especially
    devoted to “the struggle between the cartels and outsiders”, i.e.,
    the capitalists outside the cartels. He

 

entitled his work
    Compulsory Organisation, although, in order to present
    capitalism in its true light, he should, of course, have written
    about compulsory submission to monopolist associations. It is
    instructive to glance at least at the list of the methods the
    monopolist associations resort to in the present-day, the latest,
    the civilised struggle for “organisation”: (1) stopping supplies
    of raw materials ... (“one of the most important methods of
    compelling adherence to the cartel”); (2) stopping the supply of
    labour by means of “alliances” (i.e., of agreements between the
    capitalists and the trade unions by which the latter permit their
    members to work only in cartelised enterprises); (3) stopping
    deliveries; (4) closing trade outlets; (5) agreements with the
    buyers, by which the latter undertake to trade only with the
    cartels; (6) systematic price cutting (to ruin “outside” firms,
    i.e., those which refuse to submit to the monopolists. Millions
    are spent in order to sell goods for a certain time below their
    cost price; there were instances when the price of petrol was thus
    reduced from 40 to 22 marks, i.e., almost by half!); (7) stopping
    credits; (8) boycott.


Here we no longer have competition between small and large,
    between technically developed and backward enterprises. We see
    here the monopolists throttling those who do not submit to them,
    to their yoke, to their dictation. This is how this process is
    reflected in the mind of a bourgeois economist:


“Even in the purely economic sphere,” writes Kestner, “a
    certain change is taking place from commercial activity in the old
    sense of the word towards organisational-speculative
    activity. The greatest success no longer goes to the merchant
    whose technical and commercial experience enables him best of all
    to estimate the needs of the buyer, and who is able to discover
    and, so to speak, ‘awaken’ a latent demand; it goes to the
    speculative genius [?!] who knows how to estimate, or even only to
    sense in advance, the organisational development and the
    possibilities of certain connections between individual
    enterprises and the banks. . . .”


Translated into ordinary human language this means that the
    development of capitalism has arrived at a stage when, although
    commodity production still “reigns” and continues to be regarded
    as the basis of economic life, it has in reality

 

been undermined
    and the bulk of the profits go to the “geniuses” of financial
    manipulation. At the basis of these manipulations and swindles
    lies socialised production; but the immense progress of mankind,
    which achieved this socialisation, goes to benefit . . . the
    speculators. We shall see later how “on these grounds”
    reactionary, petty-bourgeois critics of capitalist imperialism
    dream of going back to “free,” “peaceful” and “honest”
    competition.


“The prolonged raising of prices which results from the
    formation of cartels,” says Kestner, “has hitherto been observed
    only in respect of the most important means of production,
    particularly coal, iron and potassium, but never in respect of
    manufactured goods. Similarly, the increase in profits resulting
    from this raising of prices has been limited only to the
    industries which produce means of production. To this observation
    we must add that the industries which process raw materials (and
    not semi-manufactures) not only secure advantages from the cartel
    formation in the shape of high profits, to the detriment of the
    finished goods industry, but have also secured a dominating
    position over the latter, which did not exist under free
    competition.”[16]


The words which I have italicised reveal the essence of the
    case which the bourgeois economists admit so reluctantly and so
    rarely, and which the present-day defenders of opportunism, led by
    Kautsky, so zealously try to evade and brush aside. Domination,
    and the violence that is associated with it, such are the
    relationships that are typical of the “latest phase of capitalist
    development”; this is what inevitably had to result, and has
    resulted, from the formation of all-powerful economic
    monopolies.


I shall give one more example of the methods employed by the
    cartels. Where it is possible to capture all or the chief sources
    of raw materials, the rise of cartels and formation of monopolies
    is particularly easy. It would be wrong, however, to assume that
    monopolies do not arise in other industries in which it is
    impossible to corner the sources of raw materials. The cement
    industry, for instance, can find its raw materials everywhere. Yet
    in Germany this industry too is strongly cartelised. The cement
    manufacturers

 

have formed regional syndicates: South German,
    Rhine-Westphalian, etc. The prices fixed are monopoly prices: 230
    to 280 marks a car-load, when the cost price is 180 marks! The
    enterprises pay a dividend of from 12 to 16 per cent—and it
    must not be forgotten that the “geniuses” of modern speculation
    know how to pocket big profits besides what they draw in
    dividends. In order to prevent competition in such a profitable
    industry, the monopolists even resort to various stratagems: they
    spread false rumours about the bad situation in their industry;
    anonymous warnings are published in the newspapers, like the
    following: “Capitalists, don’t invest your capital in the cement
    industry!”; lastly, they buy up “outsiders” (those outside the
    syndicates) and pay them compensation of 60,000, 80,000 and even
    150,000
marks.[17]

Monopoly hews a path for itself
    everywhere without scruple as to the means, from paying a “modest”
    sum to buy off competitors, to the American device of employing
    dynamite against them.


The statement that cartels can abolish crises is a fable spread
    by bourgeois economists who at all costs desire to place
    capitalism in a favourable light. On the contrary, the monopoly
    created in certain branches of industry increases and
    intensifies the anarchy inherent in capitalist production as a
    whole. The disparity between the development of agriculture
    and that of industry, which is characteristic of capitalism in
    general, is increased. The privileged position of the most highly
    cartelised, so-called heavy industry, especially coal and
    iron, causes “a still greater lack of co-ordination” in other
    branches of industry—as Jeidels, the author of one of the
    best works on “the relationship of the German big banks to
    industry,”
admits.[18]


“The more developed an economic system is,” writes Liefmann, an
    unblushing apologist of capitalism, “the more it resorts to risky
    enterprises, or enterprises in other countries, to those which
    need a great deal of time to develop, or finally, to those which
    are only of local
importance.”[19]

The

 

increased risk is connected in
    the long run with a prodigious increase of capital, which, as it
    were, overflows the brim, flows abroad, etc. At the same time the
    extremely rapid rate of technical progress gives rise to
    increasing elements of disparity between the various spheres of
    national economy, to anarchy and crises. Liefmann is obliged to
    admit that: “In all probability mankind will see further important
    technical revolutions in the near future which will also affect
    the organisation of the economic system”... electricity and
    aviation.... “As a general rule, in such periods of radical
    economic change, speculation develops on a large
scale.”...[20]


Crises of every kind—economic crises most frequently,
    but not only these—in their turn increase very considerably
    the tendency towards concentration and towards monopoly. In this
    connection, the following reflections of Jeidels on the
    significance of the crisis of 1900, which, as we have already
    seen, marked the turning-point in the history of modern monopoly,
    are exceedingly instructive:


“Side by side with the gigantic plants in the basic industries,
    the crisis of 1900 still found many plants organised on lines that
    today would be considered obsolete, the ‘pure’ (non-combined)
    plants, which were brought into being at the height of the
    industrial boom. The fall in prices and the falling off in demand
    put these ‘pure’ enterprises in a precarious position, which did
    not affect the gigantic combined enterprises at all or only
    affected them for a very short time. As a consequence of this the
    crisis of 1900 resulted in a far greater concentration of industry
    than the crisis of 1873: the latter crisis also produced a sort of
    selection of the best-equipped enterprises, but owing to the level
    of technical development at that time, this selection could not
    place the firms which successfully emerged from the crisis in a
    position of monopoly. Such a durable monopoly exists to a high
    degree in the gigantic enterprises in the modern iron and steel
    and electrical industries owing to their very complicated
    technique, far-reaching organisation and magnitude of capital,
    and, to a lesser degree, in the engineering industry, certain
    branches of the metallurgical industry, transport,
etc.”[21]



Monopoly! This is the last word in the “latest phase of
    capitalist development.” But we shall only have a very
    insufficient, incomplete, and poor notion of the real power and
    the significance of modern monopolies if we do not take into
    consideration the part played by the banks.

  Role




Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: II. BANKS AND THEIR NEW ROLE








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



II. BANKS AND THEIR NEW ROLE

The principal and primary function of banks is to serve as
      middlemen in the making of payments. In so doing they transform
      inactive money capital into active, that is, into capital
      yielding a profit; they collect all kinds of money revenues and
      place them at the disposal of the capitalist class.


As banking develops and becomes concentrated in a small number
      of establishments, the banks grow from modest middlemen into
      powerful monopolies having at their command almost the whole of
      the money capital of all the capitalists and small businessmen
      and also the larger part of the means of production and sources
      of raw materials in any one country and in a number of
      countries. This transformation of numerous modest middlemen into
      a handful of monopolists is one of the fundamental processes in
      the growth of capitalism into capitalist imperialism; for this
      reason we must first of all examine the concentration of
      banking.


In 1907-08, the combined deposits of the German joint-stock
      banks, each having a capital of more than a million marks,
      amounted to 7,000 million marks; in 1912-13, these deposits
      already amounted to 9,800 million marks, an increase of 40 per
      cent in five years; and of the 2,800 million increase, 2,750
      million was divided among 57 banks, each having a capital of
      more than 10 million marks. The distribution of the deposits
      between big and small banks was as
follows:[1]





PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEPOSITS


 
In 9 big Berlinbanks
In the other 48banks with
      a capital of more than 10million marks
In 115 bankswith a
      capitalof 1-10million marks
In small banks(with a
      capitalof less than amillion marks)

The small banks are being squeezed out by the big banks, of
      which only nine concentrate in their hands almost half the total
      deposits. But we have left out of account many important
      details, for instance, the transformation of numerous small
      banks into actual branches of the big banks, etc. Of this I
      shall speak later on.


At the end of 1913, Schulze-Gaevernitz estimated the deposits in
      the nine big Berlin banks at 5,100 million marks, out of a total
      of about 10,000 million marks. Taking into account not only the
      deposits, but the total bank capital, this author wrote: “At the
      end of 1909, the nine big Berlin banks, together with their
      affiliated banks, controlled 11,300 million marks, that is,
      about 83 per cent of the total German bank capital. The Deutsche
      Bank, which together with its affiliated banks controls
      nearly 3,000 million marks, represents, parallel to the Prussian
      State Railway Administration, the biggest and also the most
      decentralised accumulation of capital in the Old
World.”[2]


I have emphasised the reference to the “affiliated” banks
      because it is one of the most important distinguishing features
      of modern capitalist concentration. The big enterprises, and the
      banks in particular, not only completely absorb the small ones,
      but also “annex” them, subordinate them, bring them into their
      “own” group or “concern” (to use the technical term) by
      acquiring “holdings” in their capital, by purchasing or
      exchanging shares, by a system of credits, etc., etc. Professor
      Liefmann has written a voluminous “work” of about 500 pages
      describing modern “holding

 

and finance
companies,”[3]

unfortunately
      adding very dubious “theoretical” reflections to what is
      frequently undigested raw material. To what results this
      “holding” system leads in respect of concentration is best
      illustrated in the book written on the big German banks by
      Riesser, himself a banker. But before examining his data, let us
      quote a concrete example of the “holding” system.


The Deutsche Bank “group” is one of the biggest, if not the
      biggest, of the big banking groups. In order to trace the main
      threads which connect all the banks in this group, a distinction
      must be made between holdings of the first and second and third
      degree, or what amounts to the same thing, between dependence
      (of the lesser banks on the Deutsche Bank) in the first, second
      and third degree. We then obtain the following
picture:[4]




The Deutsche
      Bankhas holdings:
Direct or 1stdegree de-pendence
2nd degreedepen-dence
3rd degreedepen-dence


Permanently
in 17 otherbanks
9 of the 17 have holdings in 34 other banks
4 of the 9 haveholdings in 7other banks


For an indefiniteperiod....

Occasionally....

5 of the 8 haveholdings in 14other banks
2 of the 5 haveholdings in 2other banks


Totals......
in 30 otherbanks
14 of the 30 haveholdings in 48
      other banks
6 of the 14 have holdingsin 9
      other banks




Included in the eight banks “occasionally” dependent on the
      Deutsche Bank in the “first degree”, are three foreign banks:
      one Austrian (the Wiener Bankverein) and two Russian (the
      Siberian Commercial Bank and the Russian Bank for Foreign
      Trade). Altogether, the Deutsche Bank group

 

comprises, directly
      and indirectly, partially and totally, 87 banks; and the total
      capital—its own and that of others which it controls—is estimated at between two and three thousand million
      marks.


It is obvious that a bank which stands at the head of such a
      group, and which enters into agreement with half a dozen other
      banks only slightly smaller than itself for the purpose of
      conducting exceptionally big and profitable financial operations
      like floating state loans, has already outgrown the part of
      “middleman” and has become an association of a handful of
      monopolists.


The rapidity with which the concentration of banking proceeded
      in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century is shown by the
      following data which we quote in an abbreviated form from
      Riesser:

We see the rapid expansion of a close network of channels which
      cover the whole country, centralising all capital and all
      revenues, transforming thousands and thousands of scattered
      economic enterprises into a single national capitalist, and then
      into a world capitalist economy. The “decentralisation” that
      SchuIze-Gaevernitz, as an exponent of present-day bourgeois
      political economy, speaks of in the passage previously quoted,
      really means the subordination to a single centre of an
      increasing number of formerly relatively “independent,” or
      rather, strictly local economic units. In reality it is
      centralisation, the enhancement of the role, importance
      and power of monopolist giants.


In the older capitalist countries this “banking network” is
      still more close. In Great Britain and Ireland, in 1910, there
      were in all 7,151 branches of banks. Four big banks had more
      than 400  branches each (from 447 to 689); four had more than
      200 branches each, and eleven more than 100 each.



In France, three very big banks, Crédit
      Lyonnais, the Comptoir National and the Société
      Générale extended their operations and their
      network of branches in the following
manner.[5]

In order to show the “connections” of a big modern bank, Riesser
      gives the following figures of the number of letters dispatched
      and received by the Disconto-Gesellschaft, one of the biggest
      banks in Germany and in the world (its capital in 1914 amounted
      to 300 million marks):

The number of accounts of the big Paris bank, the Crédit
      Lyonnais, increased from 28,535  in 1875  to 633,539  in
1912.[6]


These simple figures show perhaps better than lengthy
      disquisitions how the concentration of capital and the growth of
      bank turnover are radically changing the significance of the
      banks. Scattered capitalists are transformed into a single
      collective capitalist. When carrying the current accounts of a
      few capitalists, a bank, as it were, transacts a purely
      technical and exclusively auxiliary operation. When, however,
      this operation grows to enormous dimensions we find that a
      handful of monopolists subordinate to their will all the
      operations, both commercial and industrial, of the whole of
      capitalist society; for they are enabled by means of their
      banking connections, their current accounts and other financial
      operations—first, to


ascertain exactly the
      financial position of the various capitalists, then to
      control them, to influence them by restricting or
      enlarging, facilitating or hindering credits, and finally to
      entirely determine  their fate, determine their income,
      deprive them of capital, or permit them to increase their
      capital rapidly and to enormous dimensions, etc.


We have just mentioned the 300  million marks capital of the
      Disconto-Gesellschaft of Berlin. This increase of the capital of
      the bank was one of the incidents in the struggle for hegemony
      between two of the biggest Berlin banks - the Deutsche Bank and
      the Disconto. In 1870, the first was still a novice and had a
      capital of only 15  million marks, while the second had a
      capital of 30  million marks. In 1908, the first had a capital
      of  200 million, while the second had 170  million. In 1914, the
      first increased its capital to 250  million and the second, by
      merging with another first-class big bank, the
      Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein, increased its capital to 300
      million. And, of course, this struggle for hegemony went hand in
      hand with the more and more frequent conclusion of “agreements”
      of an increasingly durable character between the two banks. The
      following are the conclusions that this development forces upon
      banking specialists who regard economic questions from a
      standpoint which does not in the least exceed the bounds of the
      most moderate and cautious bourgeois reformism.


Commenting on the increase of the capital of the Disconto
      Gesellschaft to 300 million marks, the German review, Die
      Bank, wrote: “Other banks will follow this same path and in
      time the three hundred men, who today govern Germany
      economically, will gradually be reduced to fifty, twenty-five or
      still fewer. It cannot be expected that this latest move towards
      concentration will be confined to banking. The close relations
      that exist between individual banks naturally lead to the
      bringing together of the industrial syndicates which these banks
      favour.... One fine morning we shall wake up in surprise to see
      nothing but trusts before our eyes, and to find ourselves faced
      with the necessity of substituting state monopolies for private
      monopolies. However, we have nothing to reproach ourselves with,
      except that we have

 

allowed things to follow their own course,
      slightly accelerated by the manipulation of
stocks.”[7]


This is an example of the impotence of bourgeois journalism
      which differs from bourgeois science only in that the latter is
      less sincere and strives to obscure the essence of the matter,
      to hide the forest behind the trees. To be “surprised” at the
      results of concentration, to “reproach” the government of
      capitalist Germany, or capitalist “society” (“ourselves”), to
      fear that the introduction of stocks and shares might
      “accelerate” concentration in the same way as the German
      “cartel” specialist Tschierschky fears the American trusts and
      “prefers” the German cartels on the grounds that they “may not,
      like the trusts, excessively accelerate technical and economic
progress”[8]

—is not all this a sign of
      impotence?


But facts remain facts. There are no trusts in Germany; there
      are “only” cartels—but Germany is governed by
      not more than three hundred magnates of capital, and the number
      of these is constantly diminishing. At all events, banks greatly
      intensify and accelerate the process of concentration of capital
      and the formation of monopolies in all capitalist countries,
      notwithstanding all the differences in their banking laws.


The banking system “possesses, indeed, the form of universal
      book-keeping and distribution of means of production on a social
      scale, but solely the form,” wrote Marx in Capital
      half a century ago



(Russ. trans., Vol. III, part II,
p. 144.[24])
The figures we have quoted on the growth of
      bank capital, on the increase in the number of the branches and
      offices of the biggest banks, the increase in the number of
      their accounts, etc., present a concrete picture of this
      “universal book-keeping” of the whole capitalist class;
      and not only of the capitalists, for the banks collect, even
      though temporarily, all kinds of money revenues—of small
      businessmen, office clerks, and of a tiny upper stratum of the
      working class. “Universal distribution of means of
      production”—that, from the formal aspect, is what grows out of the
      modern banks, which, numbering some three to six of the biggest

 

in France, and six to eight in Germany, control millions and
      millions. In substance, however, the distribution of
      means of production is not at all “universal,” but private,
      i.e., it conforms to the interests of big capital, and
      primarily, of huge, monopoly capital, which operates under
      conditions in which the masses live in want, in which the whole
      development of agriculture hopelessly lags behind the
      development of industry, while within industry itself the “heavy
      industries” exact tribute from all other branches of industry.


In the matter of socialising capitalist economy the
      savings-banks and post-offices are beginning to compete with the
      banks; they are more “decentralised,” i.e., their influence
      extends to a greater number of localities, to more remote
      places, to wider sections of the population. Here is the data
      collected by an American commission on the comparative growth of
      deposits in banks and
savings-banks:[9]

As they pay interest at the rate of 4 per cent and 4 1/4 per
      cent on deposits, the savings-banks must seek “profitable”
      investments for their capital, they must deal in bills,
      mortgages, etc. The boundaries between the banks and the
      savings-banks “become more and more obliterated.” The Chambers
      of Commerce of Bochum and Erfurt, for example, demand that
      savings-banks be “prohibited” from engaging in “purely” banking
      business, such as discounting bills; they demand the limitation
      of the “banking” operations of the
post-office.[10]

The banking
      magnates seem to be afraid that state monopoly will steal upon
      them from an unexpected quarter. It goes without saying,
      however, that this fear is

 

no more than an expression of the
      rivalry, so to speak, between two department managers in the
      same office; for, on the one hand, the millions entrusted to the
      savings-banks are in the final analysis actually controlled by
      these very same bank capital magnates, while, on the
      other hand, state monopoly in capitalist society is merely a
      means of increasing and guaranteeing the income of millionaires
      in some branch of industry who are on the verge of bankruptcy.


The change from the old type of capitalism, in which free
      competition predominated, to the new capitalism, in which
      monopoly reigns, is expressed, among other things, by a decline
      in the importance of the Stock Exchange. The review, Die
      Bank, writes: “The Stock Exchange has long ceased to be the
      indispensable medium of circulation that it formerly was when
      the banks were not yet able to place the bulk of new issues with
      their
clients.”[11]


“’Every bank is a Stock Exchange,’ and the bigger the bank, and
      the more successful the concentration of banking, the truer does
      this modern aphorism
ring.”[12]

“While formerly, in the seventies,
the Stock Exchange, flushed with the exuberance of youth” (a
“subtle” allusion to the Stock Exchange crash of 1873, the 
company promotion
scandals,[25] etc.), “opened the era of the
     industrialisation of Germany, nowadays the banks and industry
      are able to ‘manage it alone.’ The domination of our big banks
      over the Stock Exchange ... is nothing else than the expression
      of the completely organised German industrial state. If the
      domain of the automatically functioning economic laws is thus
      restricted, and if the domain of conscious regulation by the
      banks is considerably enlarged, the national economic
      responsibility of a few guiding heads is immensely increased,”
      so writes the German Professor
Schulze-Gaevernitz,[13]

an
      apologist of German imperialism, who is regarded as an authority
      by the imperialists of all countries, and who tries to gloss
      over the “mere detail” that the “conscious regulation” of
      economic life by the banks consists in the fleecing of the
      public by a handful of “completely organised” monopolists.

 

The
      task of a bourgeois professor is not to lay bare the entire
      mechanism, or to expose all the machinations of the bank
      monopolists, but rather to present them in a favourable light.


In the same way, Riesser, a still more authoritative economist
      and himself a banker, makes shift with meaningless phrases in
      order to explain away undeniable facts: “... the Stock Exchange
      is steadily losing the feature which is absolutely essential for
      national economy as a whole and for the circulation of
      securities in particular—that of being not only a most
      exact measuring-rod, but also an almost automatic regulator of
      the economic movements which converge on
it.”[14]


In other words, the old capitalism, the capitalism of free
      competition with its indispensable regulator, the Stock
      Exchange, is passing away. A new capitalism has come to take its
      place, bearing obvious features of something transient, a
      mixture of free competition and monopoly. The question naturally
      arises: into what is this new capitalism “developing”? But the
      bourgeois scholars are afraid to raise this question.


“Thirty years ago, businessmen, freely competing against one
      another, performed nine-tenths of the work connected with their
      business other than manual labour. At the present time,
      nine-tenths of this ‘brain work’ is performed by
      employees. Banking is in the forefront of this
evolution.”[15]

This admission by
      Schulze-Gaevernitz brings us once again to the question: into
      what is this new capitalism, capitalism in its imperialist
      stage, developing?


Among the few banks which remain at the head of all capitalist
      economy as a result of the process of concentration, there is
      naturally to be observed an increasingly marked tendency towards
      monopolist agreements, towards a bank trust. In
      America, not nine, but two very big banks, those of the
      multimillionaires Rockefeller and Morgan, control a capital of
      eleven thousand million
marks.[16]

In Germany the absorption of the
      Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein by

 

the Disconto-Gesellschaft to
      which I referred above, was commented on in the following terms
      by the Frankfurter
Zeitung,[26] 
an organ of Stock Exchange interests:


“The concentration movement of the banks is narrowing the circle
      of establishments from which it is possible to obtain credits,
      and is consequently increasing the dependence of big industry
      upon a small number of banking groups. In view of the close
      connection between industry and the financial world, the freedom
      of movement of industrial companies which need banking capital
      is restricted. For this reason, big industry is watching the
      growing trustification of the banks with mixed feelings. Indeed,
      we have repeatedly seen the beginnings of certain agreements
      between the individual big banking concerns, which aim at
      restricting
competition.”[17]


Again and again, the final word in the development of banking is
      monopoly.


As regards the close connection between the banks and industry,
      it is precisely in this sphere that the new role of the banks
      is, perhaps, most strikingly felt. When a bank discounts a bill
      for a firm, opens a current account for it, etc., these
      operations, taken separately, do not in the least diminish its
      independence, and the bank plays no other part than that of a
      modest middleman. But when such operations are multiplied and
      become an established practice, when the bank “collects” in its
      own hands enormous amounts of capital, when the running of a
      current account for a given firm enables the bank—and
      this is what happens—to obtain fuller and more detailed
      information about the economic position of its client, the
      result is that the industrial capitalist becomes more completely
      dependent on the bank.


At the same time a personal link-up, so to speak, is established
      between the banks and the biggest industrial and commercial
      enterprises, the merging of one with another through the
      acquisition of shares, through the appointment of bank directors
      to the Supervisory Boards (or Boards of Directors) of industrial
      and commercial enterprises, and vice versa. The German
      economist, Jeidels, has compiled most detailed data on this form
      of concentration of capital

 

and of enterprises. Six of the
      biggest Berlin banks were represented by their directors in 344
      industrial companies; and by their board members in 407 others,
      making a total of 751 companies. In 289 of these companies they
      either had two of their representatives on each of the
      respective Supervisory Boards, or held the posts of chairmen. We
      find these industrial and commercial companies in the most
      diverse branches of industry: insurance, transport, restaurants,
      theatres, art industry, etc. On the other hand, on the
      Supervisory Boards of these six banks (in 1910) were fifty-one
      of the biggest industrialists, including the director of Krupp,
      of the powerful “Hapag” (Hamburg-Amerika Line), etc., etc. From
      1895 to 1910, each of these six banks participated in the share
      and bond issues of many hundreds of industrial companies (the
      number ranging from 281 to
419).[18]


The “personal link-up” between the banks and industry is
      supplemented by the “personal link-up” between both of them and
      the government. “Seats on Supervisory Boards,” writes Jeidels,
      “are freely offered to persons of title, also to ex-civil
      servants, who are able to do a great deal to facilitate (!!)
      relations with the authorities.” . . . “Usually, on the
      Supervisory Board of a big bank, there is a member of parliament
      or a Berlin city councillor.”


The building and development, so to speak, of the big capitalist
      monopolies is therefore going on full steam ahead in all
      “natural” and “supernatural” ways. A sort of division of labour
      is being systematically developed amongst the several hundred
      kings of finance who reign over modern capitalist society:


“Simultaneously with this widening of the sphere of activity of
      certain big industrialists (joining the boards of banks, etc.)
      and with the assignment of provincial bank managers to definite
      industrial regions, there is a growth of specialisation among
      the directors of the big banks. Generally speaking, this
      specialisation is only conceivable when banking is conducted on
      a large scale, and particularly when it has widespread
      connections with industry. This division of labour proceeds
      along two lines: on the one hand, relations with industry as a
      whole are entrusted to one director,

 

as his special function; on
      the other, each director assumes the supervision of several
      separate enterprises, or of a group of enterprises in the same
      branch of industry or having similar interests.... (Capitalism
      has already reached the stage of organised supervision of
      individual enterprises.) One specialises in German industry,
      sometimes even in West German industry alone (the West is the
      most industrialised part of Germany), others specialise in
      relations with foreign states and foreign industry, in
      information on the characters of industrialists and others, in
      Stock Exchange questions, etc. Besides, each bank director is
      often assigned a special locality or a special branch of
      industry; one works chiefly on Supervisory Boards of electric
      companies, another, on chemical, brewing, or beet sugar plants,
      a third, in a few isolated industrial enterprises, but at the
      same time works on the Supervisory Boards of insurance
      companies.... In short, there can be no doubt that the growth in
      the dimensions and diversity of the big banks’ operations is
      accompanied by an increase in the division of labour among their
      directors with the object (and result) of, so to speak, lifting
      them somewhat out of pure banking and making them better
      experts, better judges of the general problems of industry and
      the special problems of each branch of industry, thus making
      them more capable of acting within the respective bank’s
      industrial sphere of influence. This system is supplemented by
      the banks’ endeavours to elect to their Supervisory Boards men
      who are experts in industrial affairs, such as industrialists,
      former officials, especially those formerly in the railway
      service or in mining,”
etc.[19]


We find the same system only in a slightly different form in
      French banking. For instance, one of the three biggest French
      banks, the Crédit Lyonnais, has organised a financial
      research service (service des études
      financières), which permanently employs over fifty
      engineers, statisticians, economists, lawyers, etc. This costs
      from six to seven hundred thousand francs annually. The service
      is in turn divided into eight departments: one specialises in
      collecting information on industrial establishments, another
      studies

 

general statistics, a third, railway and steamship
      companies, a fourth, securities, a fifth, financial reports,
      etc.[20]


The result is, on the one hand, the ever-growing merger, or, as
      N. I. Bukharin aptly calls it, coalescence, of bank and
      industrial capital and, on the other hand, the growth of the
      banks into institutions of a truly “universal character”. On
      this question I find it necessary to quote the exact terms used
      by Jeidels, who has best studied the subject:


“An examination of the sum total of industrial relationships
      reveals the universal character of the financial
      establishments working on behalf of industry. Unlike other kinds
      of banks, and contrary to the demand sometimes expressed in the
      literature that banks should specialise in one kind of business
      or in one branch of industry in order to prevent the ground from
      slipping from under their feet—the big banks are striving
      to make their connections with industrial enterprises as varied
      as possible in respect of the locality or branches of industry
      and are striving to eliminate the unevenness in the distribution
      of capital among localities and branches of industry resulting
      from the historical development of individual enterprises.” “One
      tendency is to make the connections with industry general;
      another tendency is to make them durable and close. In the six
      big banks both these tendencies are realised, not in full, but
      to a considerable extent and to an equal degree.”


Quite often industrial and commercial circles complain of the
      “terrorism” of the banks. And it is not surprising that such
      complaints are heard, for the big banks “command,” as will be
      seen from the following example. On November 19, 1901, one of
      the big, so-called Berlin “D” banks (the names of the four
      biggest banks begin with the letter D) wrote to the Board of
      Directors of the German Central Northwest Cement Syndicate in
      the following terms: “As we learn from the notice you published
      in a certain newspaper of the 18th inst., we must reckon with
      the possibility that the next general meeting of your syndicate,
      to be held on the 30th of this month, may decide on measures
      which are likely

 

to effect changes in your enterprise which are
      unacceptable to us. We deeply regret that, for these reasons, we
      are obliged henceforth to withdraw the credit which had hitherto
      been allowed you.... But if the said next general meeting does
      not decide upon measures which are unacceptable to us, and if we
      receive suitable guarantees on this matter for the future, we
      shall be quite willing to open negotiations with you on the
      grant of a new
credit.”[21]


As a matter of fact, this is small capital’s old complaint about
      being oppressed by big capital, but in this case it was a whole
      syndicate that fell into the category of “small” capital! The
      old struggle between small and big capital is being resumed at a
      new and immeasurably higher stage of development. It stands to
      reason that the big banks’ enterprises, worth many millions, can
      accelerate technical progress with means that cannot possibly be
      compared with those of the past. The banks, for example, set up
      special technical research societies, and, of course, only
      “friendly” industrial enterprises benefit from their work. To
      this category belong the Electric Railway Research Association,
      the Central Bureau of Scientific and Technical Research, etc.


The directors of the big banks themselves cannot fail to see
      that new conditions of national economy are being created; but
      they are powerless in the face of these phenomena.


“Anyone who has watched, in recent years,” writes Jeidels, “the
      changes of incumbents of directorships and seats on the
      Supervisory Boards of the big banks, cannot fail to have noticed
      that power is gradually passing into the hands of men who
      consider the active intervention of the big banks in the general
      development of industry to be necessary and of increasing
      importance. Between these new men and the old bank directors,
      disagreements on this subject of a business and often of a
      personal nature are growing. The issue is whether or not the
      banks, as credit institutions, will suffer from this
      intervention in industry, whether they are sacrificing tried
      principles and an assured profit to engage in a field of
      activity which has nothing in common

 

with their role as
      middlemen in providing credit, and which is leading the banks
      into a field where they are more than ever before exposed to the
      blind forces of trade fluctuations. This is the opinion of many
      of the older bank directors, while most of the young men
      consider active intervention in industry to be a necessity as
      great as that which gave rise, simultaneously with big modern
      industry, to the big banks and modern industrial banking. The
      two parties are agreed only on one point: that there are neither
      firm principles nor a concrete aim in the new activities of the
      big
banks.”[22]


The old capitalism has had its day. The new capitalism
      represents a transition towards something. It is hopeless, of
      course, to seek for “firm principles and a concrete aim” for the
      purpose of “reconciling” monopoly with free competition. The
      admission of the practical men has quite a different ring from
      the official praises of the charms of “organised” capitalism
      sung by its apologists, Schulze-Gaevernitz, Liefmann and similar
      “theoreticians.”


At precisely what period were the “new activities” of the big
      banks finally established? Jeidels gives us a fairly exact
      answer to this important question:


“The connections between the banks and industrial enterprises,
      with their new content, their new forms and their new organs,
      namely, the big banks which are organised on both a centralised
      and a decentralised basis, were scarcely a characteristic
      economic phenomenon before the nineties; in one sense, indeed,
      this initial date may be advanced to the year 1897, when the
      important  mergers took place and when, for the first time, the
      new form of decentralised organisation was introduced to suit
      the industrial policy of the banks. This starting-point could
      perhaps be placed at an even later date, for it was the crisis
      of 1900 that enormously accelerated and intensified the process
      of concentration of industry and of banking, consolidated that
      process, for the first time transformed the connection with
      industry into the actual monopoly of the big banks, and made
      this connection much closer and more
active.”[23]



Thus, the twentieth century marks the turning-point from the old
      capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general
      to the domination of finance capital.

Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: III. FINANCE CAPITAL AND THE FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



III. FINANCE CAPITAL AND THE FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY

“A steadily increasing proportion of capital in industry,”
      writes Hilferding, “ceases to belong to the industrialists who
      employ it. They obtain the use of it only through the medium of
      the banks which, in relation to them, represent the owners of
      the capital. On the other hand, the bank is forced to sink an
      increasing share of its funds in industry. Thus, to an ever
      greater degree the banker is being transformed into an
      industrial capitalist. This bank capital, i.e., capital in money
      form, which is thus actually transformed into industrial
      capital, I call ‘finance capital’.” “Finance capital is
      capital controlled by banks and employed by
industrialists.”[1]


This definition is incomplete insofar as it is silent on one
      extremely important fact—on the increase of concentration
      of production and of capital to such an extent that
      concentration is leading, and has led, to monopoly. But
      throughout the whole of his work, and particularly in the two
      chapters preceding the one from which this definition is taken,
      Hilferding stresses the part played by capitalist
      monopolies.


The concentration of production; the monopolies arising
      therefrom; the merging or coalescence of the banks with industry—such is the history of the rise of finance capital and
      such is the content of that concept.


We now have to describe how, under the general conditions of
      commodity production and private property, the “business
      operations” of capitalist monopolies inevitably lead to the
      domination of a financial oligarchy. It should be noted that
      German—and not only German—bourgeois scholars,
      like Riesser, Schulze-Gaevernitz, Liefmann and others, are all
      apologists of imperialism and of finance capital.

  

Instead of
      revealing the “mechanics” of the formation of an oligarchy, its
      methods, the size of its revenues “impeccable and peccable,” its
      connections with parliaments etc., etc., they obscure or gloss
      over them. They evade these “vexed questions” by pompous and
      vague phrases, appeals to the “sense of responsibility” of bank
      directors, by praising “the sense of duty” of Prussian
      officials, giving serious study to the petty details of
      absolutely ridiculous parliamentary bills for the “supervision”
      and “regulation” of monopolies, playing spillikins with
      theories, like, for example, the following “scholarly”
      definition, arrived at by Professor Liefmann:
      “Commerce is an occupation having for its object the
      collection, storage and supply of goods.”[2]

(The
      Professor’s bold-face italics.) . . . From this it would follow
      that commerce existed in the time of primitive man, who knew
      nothing about exchange, and that it will exist under socialism!


But the monstrous facts concerning the monstrous rule of the
      financial oligarchy are so glaring that in all capitalist
      countries, in America, France and Germany, a whole literature
      has sprung up, written from the bourgeois point of
      view, but which, nevertheless, gives a fairly truthful picture
      and criticism—petty-bourgeois, naturally—of this
      oligarchy.


Paramount importance attaches to the “holding system,” already
      briefly referred to above. The German economist, Heymann,
      probably the first to call attention to this matter, describes
      the essence of it in this way:


“The head of the concern controls the principal company
      (literally: the “mother company”); the latter reigns over the
      subsidiary companies (“daughter companies”) which in their turn
      control still other subsidiaries (“grandchild companies”),
      etc. In this way, it is possible with a comparatively small
      capital to dominate immense spheres of production. Indeed, if
      holding 50 per cent of the capital is always sufficient to
      control a company, the head of the concern needs only one
      million to control eight million in the second subsidiaries. And
      if this ‘interlocking’ is extended,

  

it is possible with one
      million to control sixteen million, thirty-two million,
etc.”[3]


As a matter of fact, experience shows that it is sufficient to
      own 40 per cent of the shares of a company in order to direct
      its
affairs,[4]

since in practice a certain number
      of small, scattered shareholders find it impossible to attend
      general meetings, etc. The “democratisation” of the ownership of
      shares, from which the bourgeois sophists and opportunist
      so-called “Social-Democrats” expect (or say that they expect)
      the “democratisation of capital,” the strengthening of the role
      and significance of small scale production, etc., is, in fact,
      one of the ways of increasing the power of the financial
      oligarchy. Incidentally, this is why, in the more advanced, or
      in the older and more “experienced” capitalist countries, the
      law allows the issue of shares of smaller denomination. In
      Germany, the law does not permit the issue of shares of less
      than one thousand marks denomination, and the magnates of German
      finance look with an envious eye at Britain, where the issue of
      one-pound shares (= 20 marks, about 10 rubles) is permitted.
      Siemens, one of the biggest industrialists and “financial kings”
      in Germany, told the Reichstag on June 7, 1900, that “the
      one-pound share is the basis of British
imperialism.”[5]

This
      merchant has a much deeper and more “Marxist” understanding of
      imperialism than a certain disreputable writer who is held to be
      one of the founders of Russian
Marxism[21] and believes that imperialism is a bad habit of a certain
nation....


But the “holding system” not only serves enormously to increase
      the power of the monopolists; it also enables them to resort
      with impunity to all sorts of shady and dirty tricks to cheat
      the public, because formally the directors of the “mother
      company” are not legally responsible for the “daughter company”,
      which is supposed to be “independent”, and through the
      medium of which they can “pull off” anything.

  

Here is an example taken from the German review, Die Bank,
      for May 1914:


“The Spring Steel Company of Kassel was regarded some years ago
      as being one of the most profitable enterprises in
      Germany. Through bad management its dividends fell from 15 per
      cent to nil. It appears that the Board, without consulting the
      shareholders, had loaned six million marks to one of
      its ‘daughter companies’, the Hassia Company, which had a
      nominal capital of only some hundreds of thousands of
      marks. This commitment, amounting to nearly treble the capital
      of the ‘mother company’, was never mentioned in its
      balance-sheets. This omission was quite legal and could be
      hushed up for two whole years because it did not violate any
      point of company law. The chairman of the Supervisory Board, who
      as the responsible head had signed the false balance-sheets,
      was, and still is, the president of the Kassel Chamber of
      Commerce. The shareholders only heard of the loan to the  Hassia
      Company long afterwards, when it had been proved to be a
      mistake”... (the writer should put this word in inverted
      commas) ... “and when Spring Steel shares dropped nearly 100
      per cent, because those in the know were getting rid of them....


“This typical example of balance-sheet jugglery, quite
      common in joint-stock companies, explains why their Boards
      of Directors are willing to undertake risky transactions with a
      far lighter heart than individual businessmen. Modern methods of
      drawing up balance-sheets not only make it possible to conceal
      doubtful undertakings from the ordinary shareholder, but also
      allow the people most concerned to escape the consequence of
      unsuccessful speculation by selling their shares in time when
      the individual businessman risks his own skin in everything he
      does....


“The balance-sheets of many joint-stock companies put us in mind
      of the palimpsests of the Middle Ages from which the visible
      inscription had first to be erased in order to discover beneath
      it another inscription giving the real meaning of the
      document. [Palimpsests are parchment documents from which the
      original inscription has been erased and another inscription
      imposed.]


“The simplest and, therefore, most common procedure for making
      balance-sheets indecipherable is to divide a single

  

business
      into several parts by setting up ‘daughter companies’—or
      by annexing them. The advantages of this system for various
      purposes—legal and illegal—are so evident that big
      companies which do not employ it are quite the
exception.”[6]


As an example of a huge monopolist company that extensively
      employs this system, the author quotes the famous General
      Electric Company (the A.E.G., to which I shall refer again later
      on). In 1912, it was calculated that this company held shares in
      175 to 200 other companies, dominating them, of course, and thus
      controlling a total capital of about 1,500 million
      marks.[7]


None of the rules of control, the publication of balance-sheets,
      the drawing up of balance-sheets according to a definite form,
      the public auditing of accounts, etc., the things about which
      well-intentioned professors and officials—that is, those
      imbued with the good intention of defending and prettyfying
      capitalism—discourse to the public, are of any avail; for
      private property is sacred, and no one can be prohibited from
      buying, selling, exchanging or hypothecating shares, etc.


The extent to which this “holding system” has developed in the
      big Russian banks may be judged by the figures given by
      E. Agalid, who for fifteen years was an official of the
      Russo-Chinese Bank and who, in May 1914, published a book, not
      altogether correctly entitled Big Banks and the World
      Market.[8]

The author divides the big Russian
      banks into two main groups: (a) banks that come under the
      “holding system,” and (b) “independent” banks—“independence”  however, being arbitrarily taken to mean
      independence of foreign banks. The author divides the
      first group into three subgroups: (1) German holdings, (2)
      British holdings, and (3) French holdings, having in view the

  

“holdings” and domination of the big foreign banks of the
      particular country mentioned. The author divides the capital of
      the banks into “productively” invested capital (industrial and
      commercial undertakings), and “speculatively” invested capital
      (in Stock Exchange and financial operations), assuming, from his
      petty-bourgeois reformist point of view, that it is possible,
      under capitalism, to separate the first form of investment from
      the second and to abolish the second form.


Here are the figures he supplies:

According to these figures, of the approximately 4,000 million
      rubles making up the “working” capital of the big banks,
      more than three-fourths, more than 3,000 million,
      belonged to banks which in reality were only “daughter
      companies” of foreign banks, and chiefly of Paris banks (the
      famous trio: Union Parisienne, Paris et Pays-Bas

  

and
      Société Générale), and of Berlin banks
      (particularly the Deutsche Bank and Disconto-Gesellschaft). Two
      of the biggest Russian banks, the Russian (Russian Bank for
      Foreign Trade) and the International (St. Petersburg
      International Commercial Bank), between 1906 and 1912 increased
      their capital from 44 to 98 million rubles, and their reserves
      from 15 million to 39 million “employing three-fourths German
      capital.” The first bank belongs to the Berlin Deutsche Bank
      “concern” and the second to the Berlin
      Disconto-Gesellschaft. The worthy Agahd is deeply indignant at
      the majority of the shares being held by the Berlin banks, so
      that the Russian shareholders are, therefore,
      powerless. Naturally, the country which exports capital skims
      the cream; for example, the Berlin Deutsche Bank, before placing
      the shares of the Siberian Commercial Bank on the Berlin market,
      kept them in its portfolio for a whole year, and then sold them
      at the rate of 193 for 100, that is, at nearly twice their
      nominal
      value, “earning” a profit of nearly six million rubles, which
      Hilferding calls “promoter’s profits.”


Our author puts the total “capacity” of the principal
      St. Petersburg banks at 8,235 million rubles, well over 8,000
      million, and the “holdings,” or rather, the extent to which
      foreign banks dominated them, he estimates as follows: French
      banks, 55 per cent; British, 10 per cent; German, 35 per
      cent. The author calculates that of the total of 8,235 million
      rubles of functioning capital, 3,687 million rubles, or over 40
      per cent, fall to the share of the Produgol and Prodamet
syndicates[22] and the syndicates in the oil, metallurgical and
      cement industries. Thus, owing to the formation of capitalist
      monopolies, the merging of bank and industrial capital has also
      made enormous strides in Russia.


Finance capital, concentrated in a few hands and exercising a
      virtual monopoly, exacts enormous and ever-increasing profits
      from the floating of companies, issue of stock, state loans,
      etc., strengthens the domination of the financial oligarchy and
      levies tribute upon the whole of society for the benefit of
      monopolists. Here is an example, taken from a multitude of
      others, of the “business” methods of the American trusts, quoted
      by Hilferding. In 1887,

  

Havemeyer founded the Sugar Trust by
      amalgamating fifteen small firms, whose total capital amounted
      to 6,500,000 dollars. Suitably “watered,” as the Americans say,
      the capital of the trust was declared to be 50 million
      dollars. This “overcapitalisation” anticipated the monopoly
      profits, in the same way as the United States Steel Corporation
      anticipates its monopoly profits in buying up as many iron ore
      fields as possible. In fact, the Sugar Trust set up monopoly
      prices, which secured it such profits that it could pay 10 per
      cent dividend on capital “watered” sevenfold, or about 70
      per cent on the capital actually invested at the time the trust
      was formed! In 1909, the capital of the Sugar Trust
      amounted to 90 million dollars. In twenty-two years, it had
      increased its capital more than tenfold.


In France the domination of the “financial oligarchy”
      (Against the Financial Oligarchy in France, the title
      of the well-known book by Lysis, the fifth edition of which was
      published in 1908) assumed a form that was only slightly
      different. Four of the most powerful banks enjoy, not a
      relative, but an “absolute monopoly” in the issue of bonds. In
      reality, this is a “trust of big banks.” And monopoly ensures
      monopoly profits from bond issues. Usually a borrowing country
      does not get more than 90 per cent of the sum of the loan, the
      remaining 10 per cent goes to the banks and other middlemen. The
      profit made by the banks out of the Russo-Chinese loan of 400
      million francs amounted to 8 per cent; out of the Russian (1904)
      loan of 800 million francs the profit amounted to 10 per cent;
      and out of the Moroccan (1904) loan of 62,500,000 francs it
      amounted to 18.75 per cent. Capitalism, which began its
      development with petty usury capital, is ending its development
      with gigantic usury capital. “The French,” says Lysis, “are the
      usurers of Europe.” All the conditions of economic life are
      being profoundly modified by this transformation of
      capitalism. With a stationary population, and stagnant industry,
      commerce and shipping, the “country” can grow rich by
      usury.  “Fifty persons, representing a capital of eight million
      francs, can control 2,000 million francs deposited in
      four banks.” The “holding system,” with which we are already
      familiar, leads to the same result. One of the biggest banks,
      the Société Générale for instance, issues
      64,000

  

bonds for its “daughter company,” the Egyptian Sugar
      Refineries. The bonds are issued at 150 per cent, i.e., the bank
      gains 50 centimes on the franc. The dividends of the new company
      were found to be fictitious, the “public” lost from 90 to 100
      million francs. “One of the directors of the Société
      Générale was a member of the board of directors of the
      Sugar Refineries.” It is not surprising that the author is
      driven to the conclusion that “the French Republic is a
      financial monarchy”; “it is the complete domination of the
      financial oligarchy; the latter dominates over the press and the
      government.”[9]


The extraordinarily high rate of profit obtained from the issue
      of bonds, which is one of the principal functions of finance
      capital, plays a very important part in the development and
      consolidation of the financial oligarchy. “There is not a single
      business of this type within the country that brings in profits
      even approximately equal to those obtained from the floatation
      of foreign loans,” says Die
Bank.[10]


“No banking operation brings in profits comparable with those
      obtained from the issue of securities!” According to the
      German Economist, the average annual profits made on
      the issue of industrial stock were as follows:




 
Per Cent


1895..............
38.6


1896..............
36.1


1897..............
66.7


1898..............
67.7


1899..............
66.9


1900..............
55.2




“In the ten years from 1891 to 1900, more than a thousand
      million marks were ‘earned’ by issuing German industrial
stock.”[11]


During periods of industrial boom, the profits of finance
      capital are immense, but during periods of depression,

  

small and
      unsound businesses go out of existence, and the big banks
      acquire “holdings” in them by buying them up for a mere song, or
      participate in profitable schemes for their “reconstruction” and
      “reorganisation.” In the “reconstruction” of undertakings which
      have been running at a loss, “the share capital is written down,
      that is, profits are distributed on a smaller capital and
      continue to be calculated on this smaller basis. Or, if the
      income has fallen to zero, new capital is called in, which,
      combined with the old and less remunerative capital, will bring
      in an adequate return.” “Incidentally,” adds Hilferding, “all
      these reorganisations and reconstructions have a twofold
      significance for the banks: first, as profitable transactions;
      and secondly, as opportunities for securing control of the
      companies in
difficulties.”[12]


Here is an instance. The Union Mining Company of Dortmund was
      founded in 1872. Share capital was issued to the amount of
      nearly 40 million marks and the market price of the shares rose
      to 170 after it had paid a 12 per cent dividend for its first
      year. Finance capital skimmed the cream and earned a trifle of
      something like 28 million marks. The principal sponsor of this
      company was that very big German Disconto-Gesellschaft which so
      successfully attained a capital of 300 million marks. Later, the
      dividends of the Union declined to nil; the shareholders had to
      consent to a “writing down” of capital, that is, to losing some
      of it in order not to lose it all. By a series of
      “reconstructions,” more than 73 million marks were written off
      the books of the Union in the course of thirty years. “At the
      present time, the original shareholders of the company possess
      only 5 per cent of the nominal value of their
shares”[13]

but the
      banks “earned something” out of every “reconstruction.”


Speculation in land situated in the suburbs of rapidly growing
      big towns is a particularly profitable operation for finance
      capital. The monopoly of the banks merges here with the monopoly
      of ground-rent and with monopoly of the means of communication,
      since the rise in the price of land and the possibility of
      selling it profitably in lots, etc., is mainly

  

dependent on good
      means of communication with the centre of the town; and these
      means of communication are in the hands of large companies which
      are connected with these same banks through the holding system
      and the distribution of seats on the boards. As a result we get
      what the German writer, L. Eschwege, a contributor to Die
      Bank who has made a special study of real estate business
      and mortgages, etc., calls a “bog.” Frantic speculation in
      suburban building lots; collapse of building enterprises like
      the Berlin firm of Boswau and Knauer, which acquired as much as
      100 million marks with the help of the “sound and solid”
      Deutsche Bank—the latter, of course, acting through the
      holding system, i.e., secretly, behind the scenes—and got
      out of it with a loss of “only” 12 million marks, then the ruin
      of small proprietors and of workers who get nothing from the
      fictitious building firms, fraudulent deals with the “honest”
      Berlin police and administration for the purpose of gaining
      control of the issue of cadastral certificates, building
      licences, etc.,
etc.[14]


“American ethics,” which the European professors and
      well-meaning bourgeois so hypocritically deplore, have, in the
      age of finance capital, become the ethics of literally every
      large city in any country.


At the beginning of 1914, there was talk in Berlin of the
      formation of a “transport trust,” i.e., of establishing
      “community of interests” between the three Berlin transport
      undertakings: the city electric railway, the tramway company and
      the omnibus company. “We have been aware,” wrote Die
      Bank, “that this plan was contemplated ever since it became
      known that the majority of the shares in the bus company had
      been acquired by the other two transport companies.... We may
      fully believe those who are pursuing this aim when they say that
      by uniting the transport services, they will secure economies,
      part of which will in time benefit the public. But the question
      is complicated by the fact that behind the transport trust that
      is being formed are the banks, which, if they desire, can
      subordinate the means of

  

transportation, which they have
      monopolised, to the interests of their real estate business. To
      be convinced of the reasonableness of such a conjecture, we need
      only recall that the interests of the big banks that encouraged
      the formation of the Electric Railway Company were already
      involved in it at the time the company was formed. That is to
      say: the interests of this transport undertaking were
      interlocked with the real estate interests. The point is that
      the eastern line of this railway was to run across land which
      this bank sold at an enormous profit for itself and for several
      partners in the transactions when it became certain the line was
      to be laid
down.”[15]


A monopoly, once it is formed and controls thousands of
      millions, inevitably penetrates into every sphere of
      public life, regardless of the form of government and all other
      “details.” In German economic literature one usually comes
      across obsequious praise of the integrity of the Prussian
      bureaucracy, and allusions to the French Panama
scandal[23] and to
      political corruption in America. But the fact is that even
      bourgeois literature devoted to German banking matters
      constantly has to go far beyond the field of purely banking
      operations; it speaks, for instance, about “the attraction of
      the banks” in reference to the increasing frequency with which
      public officials take employment with the banks, as follows:
      “How about the integrity of a state official who in his
      innermost heart is aspiring to a soft job in the
Behrenstrasse?”[16]

(The Berlin street where the head office of the Deutsche Bank is situated.)
In 1909, the publisher of Die Bank, Alfred Lansburgh, wrote an
article entitled “The Economic Significance of Byzantinism,” in which he
incidentally referred to Wilhelm II’s tour of Palestine, and to “the
immediate result of this journey, the construction of the Baghdad railway,
that fatal ‘great product of German enterprise’, which is more responsible
for the ‘encirclement’ than all our political blunders put
      together”.[17]

(By encirclement is meant the
      policy of Edward VII

  

to isolate Germany and surround her with an
      imperialist anti-German alliance.) In 1911, Eschwege, the
      contributor to this same magazine to whom I have already
      referred, wrote an article entitled “Plutocracy and
      Bureaucracy,” in which he exposed, for example, the case of a
      German official named Völker, who was a zealous member of
      the Cartel Committee and who, it turned out some time later,
      obtained a lucrative post in the biggest cartel, the Steel
      Syndicate. Similar cases, by no means casual, forced this
      bourgeois author to admit that “the economic liberty guaranteed
      by the German Constitution has become in many departments of
      economic life, a meaningless phrase” and that under the existing
      rule of the plutocracy, “even the widest political liberty
      cannot save us from being converted into a nation of unfree
      people.”[18]


As for Russia, I shall confine myself to one example. Some years
      ago, all the newspapers announced that Davydov, the director of
      the Credit Department of the Treasury, had resigned his post to
      take employment with a certain big bank at a salary which,
      according to the contract, would total over one million rubles
      in the course of several years. The Credit Department is an
      institution, the function of which is to “co-ordinate the
      activities of all the credit institutions of the country” and
      which grants subsidies to banks in St. Petersburg and Moscow
      amounting to between 800 and 1,000 million
rubles.”[19]


It is characteristic of capitalism in general that the ownership
      of capital is separated from the application of capital to
      production, that money capital is separated from industrial or
      productive capital, and that the rentier who lives entirely on
      income obtained from money capital, is separated from the
      entrepreneur and from all who are directly concerned in the
      management of capital. Imperialism, or the domination of finance
      capital, is that highest stage of capitalism in which this
      separation reaches vast proportions. The supremacy of finance
      capital over all other forms of capital means the predominance
      of the rentier and

  

of the financial oligarchy; it means that a
      small number of financially “powerful” states stand out among
      all the rest. The extent to which this process is going on may
      be judged from the statistics on emissions, i.e., the issue of
      all kinds of securities.


In the Bulletin of the International Statistical
      Institute,
A. Neymarck[20]

has published very comprehensive,
      complete and comparative figures covering the issue of
      securities all over the world, which have been repeatedly quoted
      in part in economic literature. The following are the totals he
      gives for four decades:




TOTAL ISSUES IN FRANCS PER
      DECADE(000,000,000)


1871-80..............
76.1


1881-90.............
64.5


1891-1900.........
100.4


1901-10............
197.8




In the 1870s the total amount of issues for the whole world was
      high, owing particularly to the loans floated in connection
      with the Franco-Prussian War, and the company-promotion boom
      which set in in Germany after the war. On the whole, the
      increase was relatively not very rapid during the three last
      decades of the nineteenth century, and only in the first ten
      years of the twentieth century is an enormous increase of almost
      100 per cent to be observed. Thus the beginning of the twentieth
      century marks the turning-point, not only in the growth of
      monopolies (cartels, syndicates, trusts), of which we have
      already spoken, but also in the growth of finance capital.


Neymarck estimates the total amount of issued securities current
      in the world in 1910 at about 815,000 million francs. Deducting
      from this sum amounts which might have been duplicated, he
      reduces the total to 575,000-600,000 million,

  

which is
      distributed among the various countries as follows (I take
      600,000 million):




FINANCIAL SECURITIES CURRENT
      IN 1910(000,000,000 francs)


Great Britain
142
Holland
12.5


United States
132
Belgium
7.5


France
110
Spain
7.5


Germany
95
Switzerland
6.25


Russia
31
Denmark
3.75


Austria-Hungary
24
Sweden, Norway,Rumania,etc.
2.5


Italy
14


Japan
12




From these figures we at once see standing out in sharp relief
      four of the richest capitalist countries, each of which holds
      securities to amounts ranging approximately from 100,000 to
      150,000 million francs. Of these four countries, two, Britain
      and France, are the oldest capitalist countries, and, as we
      shall see, possess the most colonies; the other two, the United
      States and Germany, are capitalist countries leading in the
      rapidity of development and the degree of extension of
      capitalist monopolies in industry. Together, these four
      countries own 479,000 million francs, that is, nearly 80 per
      cent of the world’s finance capital. In one way or another,
      nearly the whole of the rest of the world is more or less the
      debtor to and tributary of these international banker countries,
      these four “pillars” of world finance capital.


It is particularly important to examine the part which the
      export of capital plays in creating the international network of
      dependence on and connections of finance capital.

## Export of
      Capital




Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: IV. EXPORT OF CAPITAL








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



IV. EXPORT OF CAPITAL

Typical of the old capitalism, when free competition held
      undivided sway, was the export of goods. Typical of the latest
      stage of capitalism, when monopolies rule, is the export of
      capital.


Capitalism is commodity production at its highest stage of
      development, when labour-power itself becomes a commodity. The
      growth of internal exchange, and, particularly,

 

of international
      exchange, is a characteristic feature of capitalism. The uneven
      and spasmodic development of individual enterprises, individual
      branches of industry and individual countries is inevitable
      under the capitalist system. England became a capitalist country
      before any other, and by the middle of the nineteenth century,
      having adopted free trade, claimed to be the “workshop of the
      world,” the supplier of manufactured goods to all countries,
      which in exchange were to keep her provided with raw
      materials. But in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
      this monopoly was already undermined; for other countries,
      sheltering themselves with
      “protective” tariffs, developed into independent capitalist
      states. On the threshold of the twentieth century we see the
      formation of a new type of monopoly: firstly, monopolist
      associations of capitalists in all capitalistically developed
      countries; secondly, the monopolist position of a few very rich
      countries, in which the accumulation of capital has reached
      gigantic proportions. An enormous “surplus of capital”  has
      arisen in the advanced countries.


It goes without saying that if capitalism could develop
      agriculture, which today is everywhere lagging terribly behind
      industry, if it could raise the living standards of the masses,
      who in spite of the amazing technical progress are everywhere
      still half-starved and poverty-stricken, there could be no
      question of a surplus of capital. This “argument” is very often
      advanced by the petty-bourgeois critics of capitalism. But if
      capitalism did these things it would not be capitalism; for both
      uneven development and a semi-starvation level of existence of
      the masses are fundamental and inevitable conditions and
      constitute premises of this mode of production. As long as
      capitalism remains what it is, surplus capital will be utilised
      not for the purpose of raising the standard of living of the
      masses in a given country, for this would mean a decline in
      profits for the capitalists, but for the purpose of increasing
      profits by exporting capital abroad to the backward
      countries. In these backward countries profits are usually high,
      for capital is scarce, the price of land is relatively low,
      wages are low, raw materials are cheap. The export of capital is
      made possible by a number of backward countries having already
      been drawn into

  

world capitalist intercourse; main railways have
      either been or are being built in those countries, elementary
      conditions for industrial development have been created,
      etc. The need to export capital arises from the fact that in a
      few countries capitalism has become “overripe” and (owing to the
      backward state of agriculture and the poverty of the masses)
      capital cannot find a field for “profitable” investment.


Here are approximate figures showing the amount of capital
      invested abroad by the three principal
countries[1]:

12.5


1914.....
75-100.0

44.0




This table shows that the export of capital reached enormous
      dimensions only at the beginning of the twentieth
      century. Before the war the capital invested abroad by the three
      principal countries amounted to between 175,000 million and
      200,000 million francs. At the modest rate of 5 per cent, the
      income from this sum should reach from 8,000 to 10,000 million
      francs a year—a sound basis for the imperialist
      oppression and exploitation of most of the countries and nations
      of the world, for the capitalist parasitism of a handful of
      wealthy states!



How is this capital invested abroad distributed among the
      various countries? Where is it invested? Only an
      approximate answer can be given to these questions, but it is
      one sufficient to throw light on certain general relations and
      connections of modern imperialism.

The principal spheres of investment of British capital are the
      British colonies, which are very large also in America (for
      example, Canada), not to mention Asia, etc. In this case,
      enormous exports of capital are bound up most closely with vast
      colonies, of the importance of which for imperialism I shall
      speak later. In the case of France the situation is
      different. French capital exports are invested mainly in Europe,
      primarily in Russia (at least ten thousand million francs). This
      is mainly loan capital, government loans, and not capital
      invested in industrial undertakings. Unlike British colonial
      imperialism, French imperialism might be termed usury
      imperialism. In the case of Germany, we have a third type;
      colonies are inconsiderable, and German capital invested abroad
      is divided most evenly between Europe and America.


The export of capital influences and greatly accelerates the
      development of capitalism in those countries to which it is
      exported. While, therefore, the export of capital may tend to a
      certain extent to arrest development in the capital-exporting
      countries, it can only do so by expanding and deepening the
      further development of capitalism throughout the world.


The capital-exporting countries are nearly always able to obtain
      certain “advantages,” the character of which throws light on the
      peculiarity of the epoch of finance capital and

 

monopoly. The
      following passage, for instance, appeared in the Berlin review,
      Die Bank, for October 1913:


“A comedy worthy of the pen of Aristophanes is lately being
      played on the international capital market. Numerous foreign
      countries, from Spain to the Balkan states, from Russia to
      Argentina, Brazil and China, are openly or secretly coming into
      the big money market with demands, sometimes very persistent,
      for loans. The money markets are not very bright at the moment
      and the political outlook is not promising. But not a single
      money market dares to refuse a loan for fear that its neighbour
      may forestall it, consent to grant a loan and so secure some
      reciprocal service. In these international transactions the
      creditor nearly always manages to secure some extra benefit: a
      favourable clause in a commercial treaty, a coating station, a
      contract to construct a harbour, a fat concession, or an order
      for
guns.”[2]


Finance capital has created the epoch of monopolies, and
      monopolies introduce everywhere monopolist principles: the
      utilisation of “connections” for profitable transactions takes
      the place of competition on the open market. The most usual
      thing is to stipulate that part of the loan granted shall be
      spent on purchases in the creditor country, particularly on
      orders for war materials, or for ships, etc. In the course of
      the last two decades (1890-1910), France has very often resorted
      to this method. The export of capital thus becomes a means of
      encouraging the export of commodities. In this connection,
      transactions between particularly big firms assume a form which,
      as
Schilder[3]

“mildly” puts it, “borders on
      corruption.” Krupp in Germany, Schneider in France, Armstrong in
      Britain are instances of firms which have close connections with
      powerful banks and governments and which cannot easily be
      “ignored” when a loan is being arranged.


France, when granting loans to Russia, “squeezed” her in the
      commercial treaty of September 16, 1905, stipulating for certain
      concessions to run till 1917. She did the same in the commercial
      treaty with Japan of August 19, 1911. The tariff war between
      Austria and Serbia, which lasted,

 

with a seven months’ interval,
      from 1906 to 1911, was partly caused by Austria and France
      competing to supply Serbia with war materials. In January 1912,
      Paul Deschanel stated in the Chamber of Deputies that from 1908
      to 1911 French firms had supplied war materials to Serbia to the
      value of 45 million francs.


A report from the Austro-Hungarian Consul at San-Paulo (Brazil)
      states: “The Brazilian railways are being built chiefly by
      French, Belgian, British and German capital. In the financial
      operations connected with the construction of these railways the
      countries involved stipulate for orders for the necessary
      railway materials.”


Thus finance capital, literally, one might say, spreads its net
      over all countries of the world. An important role in this is
      played by banks founded in the colonies and by their
      branches. German imperialists look with envy at the “old”
      colonial countries which have been particularly “successful” in
      providing for themselves in this respect. In 1904, Great Britain
      had 50 colonial banks with 2,279 branches (in 1910 there were 72
      banks with 5,449 branches), France had 20 with 136 branches;
      Holland, 16 with 68 branches; and Germany had “only” 13 with 70
      branches.[4]

The American capitalists, in their
      turn, are jealous of the English and German: “In South America,”
      they complained in 1915, “five German banks have forty branches
      and five British banks have seventy branches.... Britain and
      Germany have invested in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in the
      last twenty-five years approximately four thousand million
      dollars, and as a result together enjoy 46 per cent of the total
      trade of these three
countries.”[5]


The capital-exporting countries have divided the world among
      themselves in the figurative sense of the term. But finance
      capital has led to the actual division of the world.

Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



V. DIVISION OF THE WORLD AMONG CAPITALIST ASSOCIATIONS

Monopolist capitalist associations, cartels, syndicates and
      trusts first divided the home market among themselves and
      obtained more or less complete possession of the industry of
      their own country. But under capitalism the home market is
      inevitably bound up with the foreign market. Capitalism long ago
      created a world market. As the export of capital increased, and
      as the foreign and colonial connections and “spheres of
      influence” of the big monopolist associations expanded in all
      ways, things “naturally” gravitated towards an international
      agreement among these associations, and towards the formation of
      international cartels.


This is a new stage of world concentration of capital and
      production, incomparably higher than the preceding stages. Let
      us see how this supermonopoly develops.


The electrical industry is highly typical of the latest
      technical achievements and is most typical of capitalism at the
      end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
      centuries. This industry has developed most in the two leaders
      of the new capitalist countries, the United States and
      Germany. In Germany, the crisis of 1900 gave a particularly
      strong impetus to its concentration. During the crisis, the
      banks, which by that time had become fairly well merged with
      industry, enormously accelerated and intensified the ruin of
      relatively small firms and their absorption by the large
      ones. “The banks,” writes Jeidels, “refused a helping hand to
      the very firms in greatest need of capital, and brought on first
      a frenzied boom and then the hopeless failure of the companies
      which had not been connected with them closely
enough.” [1]


As a result, after 1900, concentration in Germany progressed
      with giant strides. Up to 1900 there had been seven or eight
      “groups” in the electrical industry. Each consisted of several
      companies (altogether there were 28) and each was backed by from
      2 to 11 banks. Between 1908 and 1912 all these groups were
      merged into two, or one. The following diagram shows the
      process:

By 1912:
A.E.G. (G.E.C.) Siemens &
      Halske Schuckert


 
(in close
      "co-operation" since 1908)




The famous A.E.G. (General Electric Company), which grew up in
      this way, controls 175 to 200 companies (through the “holding”
      system), and a total capital of approximately 1,500
      million marks. Of direct agencies abroad alone, it has
      thirty-four, of which twelve are joint-stock companies, in more
      than ten countries. As early as 1904 the amount of capital
      invested abroad by the German electrical industry was estimated
      at 233 million marks. Of this sum, 62 million were invested in
      Russia. Needless to say, the A.E.G. is a huge “combine”—its
      manufacturing companies alone number no less than sixteen—producing
      the most diverse articles, from cables and
      insulators to motor-cars and flying machines.


But concentration in Europe was also a component part of the
      process of concentration in America, which developed in the
      following way:




 
General Electric Company



      United States:
    
Thomas-Houston Co.establishes a firm
      inEurope
Edison Co. establishes in Eu-rope the
      French Edison Co.which transfers its patents tothe
      German firm



      Germany:
    
Union Electric Co.
General Electric Co. (A.E.G.)




Thus, two electrical “great powers” were formed: “there
      are no other electrical companies in the world
      completely independent of them,” wrote Heinig in his
      article “The Path of the Electric Trust.” An idea, although far
      from complete, of the turnover and the size of the enterprises
      of the two “trusts” can be obtained from the following figures:





 
Turnover(000,000marks)
Number ofemployees

30,70060,800
14.521.7




And then, in 1907, the German and American trusts concluded an
      agreement by which they divided the world between
      them. Competition between them ceased. The American General
      Electric Company (G.E.C.) “got” the United States and
      Canada. The German General Electric Company (A.E.G.) “got”
      Germany, Austria, Russia, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Turkey
      and the Balkans. Special agreements, naturally secret, were
      concluded regarding the penetration of “daughter companies” into
      new branches of industry, into “new” countries formally not yet
      allotted. The two trusts were to exchange inventions and
      experiments. [2]


The difficulty of competing against this trust, actually a
      single world-wide trust controlling a capital of several
      thousand million, with “branches”, agencies, representatives,
      connections, etc., in every corner of the world, is
      self-evident. But the division of the world between two powerful
      trusts does not preclude redivision if the relation of forces
      changes as a result of uneven development, war, bankruptcy, etc.


An instructive example of an attempt at such a redivision, of
      the struggle for redivision, is provided by the oil industry.


“The world oil market,” wrote Jeidels in 1905, “is even today
      still divided between two great financial groups—Rockefeller’s American Standard Oil Co., and Rothschild and
      Nobel, the controlling interests of the Russian oilfields in
      Baku. The two groups are closely connected. But for several
      years five enemies have been threatening their
monopoly”:[3]

(1) the
      exhaustion of the American oilfields;
   

(2) the competition of the
      firm of Mantashev of Baku;
(3) the Austrian oilfields;
(4) the
      Rumanian oilfields;
(5) the overseas oilfields, particularly in
      the Dutch colonies (the extremely rich firms, Samuel and Shell,
      also connected with British capital). The three last groups are
      connected with the big German banks, headed by the huge Deutsche
      Bank. These banks independently and systematically developed the
      oil industry in Rumania, for example, in order to have a
      foothold of their “own.” In 1907, the foreign capital invested
      in the Rumanian oil industry was estimated at 185 million
      francs, of which 74 million was German
capital. [4]


A struggle began for the “division of the world”, as, in fact,
      it is called in economic literature. On the one hand, the
      Rockefeller “oil trust” wanted to lay its hands on
      everything; it formed a “daughter company” right
      in Holland, and bought up oilfields in the Dutch Indies, in
      order to strike at its principal enemy, the Anglo-Dutch Shell
      trust. On the other hand, the Deutsche Bank and the other German
      banks aimed at “retaining” Rumania “for themselves” and at
      uniting her with Russia against Rockefeller. The latter
      possessed far more capital and an excellent system of oil
      transportation and distribution. The struggle had to end, and
      did end in 1907, with the utter defeat of the Deutsche Bank,
      which was confronted with the alternative: either to liquidate
      its “oil interests” and lose millions, or submit. It chose to
      submit, and concluded a very disadvantageous agreement with the
      “oil trust.”  The Deutsche Bank agreed “not to attempt anything
      which might injure American interests.” Provision was made,
      however, for the annulment of the agreement in the event of
      Germany establishing a state oil monopoly.


Then the “comedy of oil” began. One of the German finance kings,
      von Gwinner, a director of the Deutsche Bank, through his
      private secretary, Stauss, launched a campaign for a
      state oil monopoly. The gigantic machine of the huge German bank
      and all its wide “connections” were set in motion. The press
      bubbled over with “patriotic” indignation against the “yoke” of
      the American trust, and, on March 15, 1911, the Reichstag, by an
      almost unanimous vote, adopted

   

a motion asking the government to
      introduce a bill for the establishment of an oil monopoly. The
      government seized upon this “popular” idea, and the game of the
      Deutsche Bank, which hoped to cheat its American counterpart and
      improve its business by a state monopoly, appeared to have been
      won. The German oil magnates already saw visions of enormous
      profits, which would not be less than those of the Russian sugar
      refiners.... But, firstly, the big German banks quarrelled among
      themselves over the division of the spoils. The
      Disconto-Gesellschaft exposed the covetous aims of the Deutsche
      Bank; secondly, the government took fright at the prospect of a
      struggle with Rockefeller, for it was very doubtful whether
      Germany could be sure of obtaining oil from other sources (the
      Rumanian output was small); thirdly, just at that time the 1913
      credits of a thousand million marks were voted for Germany’s war
      preparations. The oil monopoly project was postponed. The
      Rockefeller “oil trust” came out of the struggle, for the time
      being, victorious.


The Berlin review, Die Bank, wrote in this connection
      that
      Germany could fight the oil trust only by establishing an
      electricity monopoly and by converting water-power into cheap
      electricity. “But,” the author added, “the electricity monopoly
      will come when the producers need it, that is to say, when the
      next great crash in the electrical industry is imminent, and
      when the gigantic, expensive power stations now being put up at
      great cost everywhere by private electrical concerns, which are
      already obtaining certain franchises from towns, from states,
      etc., can no
      longer work at a profit. Water-power will then have to be
      used. But it will be impossible to convert it into cheap
      electricity at state expense; it will also have to be handed
      over to a ‘private monopoly controlled by the state’, because
      private industry has already concluded a number of contracts and
      has stipulated for heavy compensation.... So it was with the
      nitrate monopoly, so it is with the oil monopoly, so it will be
      with the electric power monopoly. It is time our state
      socialists, who allow themselves to be blinded by a beautiful
      principle, understood, at last, that in Germany the monopolies
      have never pursued the aim, nor have they had the result, of
      benefiting the consumer, or even of handing over to the state
      part of the promoter’s profits; they have served

   

only to
      facilitate, at the expense of the state, the recovery of private
      industries which were on the verge of
bankruptcy. [5]


Such are the valuable admissions which the German bourgeois
      economists are forced to make. We see plainly here how private
      and state monopolies are interwoven in the epoch of finance
      capital; how both are but separate links in the imperialist
      struggle between the big monopolists for the division of the
      world.


In merchant shipping, the tremendous development of
      concentration has ended also in the division of the world. In
      Germany two powerful companies have come to the fore: the
      Hamburg-Amerika and the Norddeutscher Lloyd, each having a
      capital of 200 million marks (in stocks and bonds) and
      possessing shipping tonnage to the value of 185 to 189 million
      marks. On the other hand, in America, on January 1, 1903, the
      International Mercantile Marine Co., known as the Morgan trust,
      was formed; it united nine American and British steamship
      companies, and possessed a capital of 120 million dollars (480
      million marks). As early as 1903, the German giants and this
      American-British trust concluded an agreement to divide the
      world with a consequent division of profits. The German
      companies undertook not to compete in the Anglo-American
      traffic. Which ports were to be “allotted” to each was precisely
      stipulated; a joint committee of control was set up, etc. This
      agreement was concluded for twenty years, with the prudent
      provision for its annulment in the event of
war. [6]


Extremely instructive also is the story of the formation of the
      International Rail Cartel. The first attempt of the British,
      Belgian and German rail manufacturers to form such a cartel was
      made as early as 1884, during a severe industrial
      depression. The manufacturers agreed not to compete with one
      another in the home markets of the countries involved, and they
      divided the foreign markets in the following quotas: Great
      Britain, 66 per cent; Germany, 27 per cent; Belgium, 7 per
      cent. India was reserved entirely for Great Britain. Joint war
      was declared against a British firm which remained outside the
      cartel, the cost of which

   

was met by a percentage levy on all
      sales. But in 1886 the cartel collapsed when two British firms
      retired from it. It is characteristic that agreement could not
      be achieved during subsequent boom periods.


At the beginning of 1904, the German steel syndicate was
      formed. In November 1904, the International Rail Cartel was
      revived, with the following quotas: Britain, 53.5 per cent;
      Germany, 28.83 per cent; Belgium, 17.67 per cent. France came in
      later and received 4.8 per cent, 5.8 per cent and 6.4 per cent
      in the first, second and third year respectively, over and above
      the 100 per cent limit, i.e., out of a total of 104.8 per cent,
      etc. In 1905, the United States Steel Corporation entered the
      cartel; then Austria and Spain. “At the present time,” wrote
      Vogelstein
      in 1910, “the division of the world is complete, and the big
      consumers, primarily the state railways—since the world
      has been parcelled out without consideration for their
      interests—can now dwell like the poet in the heavens of
Jupiter.” [7]


Let me also mention the International Zinc Syndicate which was
      established in 1909 and which precisely apportioned output among
      five groups of factories: German, Belgian, French, Spanish and
      British; and also the International Dynamite Trust, which,
      Liefmann says, is “quite a modern, close alliance of all the
      German explosives manufacturers who, with the French and
      American dynamite manufacturers, organised in a similar manner,
      have divided the whole world among themselves, so to
speak.”[8]


Liefmann calculated that in 1897 there were altogether about
      forty international cartels in which Germany had a share, while
      in 1910 there were about a hundred.


Certain bourgeois writers (now joined by Karl Kautsky, who has
      completely abandoned the Marxist position he had held, for
      example, in 1909) have expressed the opinion that international
      cartels, being one of the most striking expressions of the
      internationalisation of capital, give the hope of peace among
      nations under capitalism. Theoretically, this opinion is
      absolutely absurd, while in practice it is sophistry and a
      dishonest defence of the worst opportunism.

   

International
      cartels show to what point capitalist monopolies have developed,
      and the object of the struggle
      between the various capitalist associations. This last
      circumstance is the most important; it alone shows us the
      historico-economic meaning of what is taking place; for the
      forms of the struggle may and do constantly change in
      accordance with varying, relatively specific and temporary
      causes, but the substance of the struggle, its class
      content, positively cannot change while
      classes exist. Naturally, it is in the interests of, for
      example, the German bourgeoisie, to whose side Kautsky has in
      effect gone over in his theoretical arguments (I shall deal with
      this later), to obscure the substance of the present
      economic struggle (the division of the world) and to emphasise
      now this and now another form of the struggle. Kautsky
      makes the same mistake. Of course, we have in mind not only the
      German bourgeoisie, but the bourgeoisie all over the world. The
      capitalists divide the world, not out of any particular malice,
      but because the degree of concentration which has been reached
      forces them to adopt this method in order to obtain profits. And
      they divide it “in proportion to capital”, “in proportion to
      strength,” because there cannot be any other method of division
      under commodity production and capitalism. But strength varies
      with the degree of economic and political development. In order
      to understand what is taking place, it is necessary to know what
      questions are settled by the changes in strength. The question
      as to whether these changes are “purely” economic or
      non-economic (e.g., military) is a secondary one, which cannot
      in the least affect fundamental views on the latest epoch of
      capitalism. To substitute the question of the form of the
      struggle and agreements (today peaceful, tomorrow warlike, the
      next day warlike again) for the question of the substance of the
      struggle and agreements between capitalist associations is to
      sink to the role of a sophist.


The epoch of the latest stage of capitalism shows us that
      certain relations between capitalist associations grow up,
      based on the economic division of the world; while
      parallel to and in connection with it, certain relations grow up
      between political alliances, between states, on the basis of the
      territorial division of the world, of the struggle for colonies,
      of the “struggle for spheres of influence.”

## Among the Great Powers




Lenin: 1916/imp-hsc: VI. DIVISION OF THE WORLD AMONG THE GREAT POWERS








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE

VI. DIVISION OF THE WORLD AMONG THE GREAT POWERS

In his book, on “the territorial development of the European
      colonies,”
A. Supan, [1]

the geographer, gives the following
      brief summary of this development at the end of the nineteenth
      century:




PERCENTAGE OF TERRITORY
      BELONGING TO THE EUROPEANCOLONIAL POWERS(Including
      the United States)


 
1876
1900
Increase or decrease


Africa..........
10.8

+79.6


Polynesia....
56.8
98.9
+42.1


Asia............

56.6
+5.1


Australia.....
100.0
100.0
—


America......
27.5
27.2
-0.3




   “The characteristic feature of this period,” he concludes, “is,
      therefore, the division of Africa and Polynesia.” As there are
      no unoccupied territories—that is, territories that do
      not belong to any state in Asia and America, it is necessary to
      amplify Supan’s conclusion and say that the characteristic
      feature of the period under review is the final partitioning of
      the globe—final, not in the sense that repartition
      is impossible; on the contrary, repartitions are possible
      and inevitable—but in the sense that the colonial policy
      of the capitalist countries has completed the seizure
      of the unoccupied territories on our planet. For the first time
      the world is completely divided up, so that in the future
      only redivision is possible, i.e., territories can only
      pass from one “owner” to another, instead of passing as
      ownerless territory to an owner


   Hence, we are living in a peculiar epoch of world colonial
      policy, which is most closely connected with the “latest stage
      in the development of capitalism,” with finance capital. For
      this reason, it is essential first of all to deal in greater
      detail with the facts, in order to ascertain as exactly as
      possible what distinguishes this epoch from those preceding it,
      and what the present situation is. In the first place, two
      questions of fact arise here: is an intensification of colonial
      policy, a sharpening of the struggle for colonies, observed
      precisely in the epoch of finance capital? And how, in this
      respect, is the world divided at the present time?


   The American writer, Morris, in his book on the history of
   colonisation,[2]
 made an attempt to sum up the data
      on the colonial possessions of Great Britain, France and Germany
      during different periods of the nineteenth century. The
      following is a brief summary of the results he has obtained:

   For Great Britain, the period of the enormous expansion of
      colonial conquests was that between 1860 and 1880, and it was
      also very considerable in the last twenty years of the
      nineteenth century. For France and Germany this period falls
      precisely in these twenty years. We saw above that the
      development of premonopoly capitalism, of capitalism in which
      free competition was predominant, reached its limit in the 1860s
      and 1870s. We now see that it is precisely after that
      period that the tremendous “boom” in colonial conquests
      begins, and that the struggle for the territorial division of
      the world becomes extraordinarily sharp. It is beyond doubt,
      therefore, that capitalism’s transition to the stage of monopoly
      capitalism, to finance capital, is connected with the
      intensification of the struggle for the partitioning of the
      world.


   Hobson, in his work on imperialism, marks the years 1884-1900 as
      the epoch of intensified “expansion” of the chief European
      states. According to his estimate, Great Britain during these
      years acquired 3,700,000 square miles of territory with
      57,000,000 inhabitants; France, 3,600,000 square miles with
      36,500,000; Germany, 1,000,000 square miles with 14,700,000;
      Belgium, 900,000 square miles with 30,000,000; Portugal, 800,000
      square miles with 9,000,000 inhabitants. The scramble for
      colonies by all the capitalist states at the end of the
      nineteenth century and particularly since the 1880s is a
      commonly known fact in the history of diplomacy and of foreign
      policy.


   In the most flourishing period of free competition in Great
      Britain, i.e., between 1840 and 1860, the leading British
      bourgeois politicians were opposed to colonial policy
      and were of the opinion that the liberation of the colonies,
      their complete separation from Britain, was inevitable and
      desirable. M. Beer, in an article, “Modern British
Imperialism,” [3]
   published in 1898, shows that in
      1852, Disraeli, a statesman who was generally inclined towards
      imperialism, declared: “The colonies are millstones round our
      necks.” But at the end of the nineteenth century the British
      heroes of the hour were Cecil Rhodes and Joseph Chamberlain, who
      openly advocated imperialism and applied the imperialist policy
      in the most cynical manner!


   It is not without interest to observe that even then these
      leading British bourgeois politicians saw the connection between
      what might be called the purely economic and the socio-political
      roots of modern imperialism. Chamberlain advocated imperialism
      as a “true, wise and economical policy,” and pointed
      particularly to the German, American and Belgian competition
      which Great Britain was encountering in the world
      market. Salvation lies in monopoly,  said the capitalists as
      they formed cartels, syndicates and trusts. Salvation lies in
      monopoly, echoed the political leaders of the bourgeoisie,
      hastening to appropriate the parts of the world not yet shared
      out. And Cecil Rhodes, we are informed by his intimate friend,
      the journalist Stead, expressed his imperialist views to him in
      1895 in the following terms: “I was in the East End of London (a
      working-class quarter) yesterday and attended a meeting of the
      unemployed. I listened to the wild speeches, which were just a
      cry for ‘bread! bread!’ and on my way home I pondered over the
      scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of
      imperialism.... My cherished idea is a solution for the social
      problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of
      the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial
      statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus
      population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the
      factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said, is a
      bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you
      must become
imperialists.[4]


   That was said in 1895 by Cecil Rhodes, millionaire, a king of
      finance, the man who was mainly responsible for the Anglo-Boer
      War. True, his defence of imperialism is crude and cynical, but
      in substance it does not differ from the “theory” advocated by
      Messrs. Maslov, Südekum, Potresov, David, the founder of
      Russian Marxism and others. Cecil Rhodes was a somewhat more
      honest social-chauvinist....


   To present as precise a picture as possible of the territorial
      division of the world and of the changes which have occurred
      during the last decades in this respect, I shall utilise the
      data furnished by Supan in the work already quoted on the
      colonial possessions of all the powers of the world. Supan takes
      the years 1876 and 1900; I shall take the year 1876—a
      year very aptly selected, for it is precisely by that time that
      the pre-monopolist stage of development of West-European
      capitalism can be said to have been, in the main, completed—and the year 1914, and instead of Supan’s figures I shall
      quote the more recent statistics of Hübner’s
      Geographical and Statistical Tables. Supan gives
      figures only for colonies; I think it useful, in order to
      present a complete picture of the division of the world, to add
      brief data on non-colonial and semi-colonial countries, in which
      category I place Persia, China and Turkey: the first of these
      countries is already almost completely a colony, the second and
      third are becoming such.


   We thus get the following result:

   We clearly see from these figures how “complete” was the
      partition of the world at the turn of the twentieth
      century. After 1876 colonial possessions increased to enormous
      dimensions, by more than fifty per cent, from 40,000,000 to
      65,000,000 square kilometres for the six biggest powers; the
      increase amounts to 25,000,000 square kilometres, fifty per cent
      more than the area of the metropolitan countries (16,500,000
      square kilometres). In 1876 three powers had no colonies, and a
      fourth, France, had scarcely any. By 1914 these four powers had
      acquired colonies with an area of 14,100,000 square kilometres,
      i.e., about half as much again as the area of Europe, with a
      population of nearly 100,000,000. The unevenness in the rate of
      expansion of colonial possessions is very great. If, for
      instance, we compare France, Germany and Japan, which do not
      differ very much in area and population, we see that the first
      has acquired almost three times as much colonial territory as
      the other two combined. In regard to finance capital, France, at
      the beginning of the period we are considering, was also,
      perhaps, several times richer than Germany and Japan put
      together. In addition to, and on the basis of, purely economic
      conditions, geographical and other conditions also affect the
      dimensions of
      colonial possessions. However strong the process of levelling
      the world, of levelling the economic and living conditions in
      different countries, may have been in the past decades as a
      result of the pressure of large-scale industry, exchange and
      finance capital, considerable differences still remain; and
      among the six countries mentioned we see, firstly, young
      capitalist countries (America, Germany, Japan) whose progress
      has been extraordinarily rapid; secondly, countries with an old
      capitalist development (France and Great Britain), whose
      progress lately has been much slower than that of the previously
      mentioned countries, and thirdly, a country most backward
      economically (Russia), where modern capitalist imperialism is
      enmeshed, so to speak, in a particularly close network of
      pre-capitalist relations.


   Alongside the colonial possessions of the Great Powers, we have
      placed the small colonies of the small states, which are, so to
      speak, the next objects of a possible and probable “redivision”
      of colonies. These small states mostly retain their colonies
      only because the big powers are torn by conflicting interests,
      friction, etc., which prevent them from coming to an agreement
      on the division of the spoils. As to the “semi-colonial” states,
      they provide an example of the transitional forms which are to
      be found in all spheres of nature and society. Finance capital
      is such a great, such a decisive, you might say, force in all
      economic and in all international relations, that it is capable
      of subjecting, and actually does subject, to itself even states
      enjoying the fullest political independence; we shall shortly
      see examples of this. Of course, finance capital finds most
      “convenient,” and derives the greatest profit from, a form
      of subjection which involves the loss of the political
      independence of the subjected countries and peoples. In this
      respect, the semi-colonial countries provide a typical example
      of the “middle stage.” It is natural that the struggle for these
      semidependent countries should have become particularly bitter
      in the epoch of finance capital, when the rest of the world has
      already been divided up.


   Colonial policy and imperialism existed before the latest stage
      of capitalism, and even before capitalism. Rome, founded on
      slavery, pursued a colonial policy and practised
      imperialism. But “general” disquisitions on imperialism, which
      ignore, or put into the background, the fundamental difference
      between socio-economic formations, inevitably turn into the most
      vapid banality or bragging, like the comparison: “Greater Rome
      and Greater
Britain.” [5]

Even the capitalist colonial policy
      of previous stages of
      capitalism is essentially different from the colonial policy of
      finance capital.


   The principal feature of the latest stage of capitalism is the
      domination of monopolist associations of big employers. These
      monopolies are most firmly established when all the
      sources of raw materials are captured by one group, and we have
      seen with what zeal the international capitalist associations
      exert every effort to deprive their rivals of all opportunity of
      competing, to buy up, for example, ironfields, oilfields,
      etc. Colonial possession alone gives the monopolies complete
      guarantee against all contingencies in the struggle against
      competitors, including the case of the adversary wanting to be
      protected by a law establishing a state monopoly. The more
      capitalism is developed, the more strongly the shortage of raw
      materials is felt, the more intense the competition and the hunt
      for sources of raw materials throughout the whole world, the
      more desperate the struggle for the acquisition of colonies.


   “It may be asserted,” writes Schilder, “although it may sound
      paradoxical to some, that in the more or less foreseeable future
      the growth of the urban and industrial population is more likely
      to be hindered by a shortage of raw materials for industry than
      by a shortage of food.” For example, there is a growing shortage
      of timber—the price of which is steadily rising—of
      leather, and of raw materials for the textile
      industry. “Associations of manufacturers are making efforts to
      create an equilibrium between agriculture and industry in the
      whole of world economy; as an example of this we might mention
      the International Federation of Cotton Spinners’ Associations in
      several of the most important industrial countries, founded in
      1904, and the European Federation of Flax Spinners’
      Associations, founded on the same model in
1910.” [6]


   Of course, the bourgeois reformists, and among them particularly
      the present-day adherents of Kautsky, try to belittle the
      importance of facts of this kind by arguing that raw materials
      “could be” obtained in the open market without a “costly and
      dangerous” colonial policy; and that the supply of raw materials
      “could be” increased enormously by “simply” improving conditions
      in agriculture in general. But such arguments become an apology
      for imperialism, an attempt to paint it in bright colours,
      because they ignore the principal feature of the latest stage of
      capitalism: monopolies. The free market is becoming more and
      more a thing of the past; monopolist syndicates and trusts are
      restricting it with every passing day, and “simply” improving
      conditions in agriculture means improving the conditions of the
      masses, raising wages and reducing profits. Where, except in the
      imagination of sentimental reformists, are there any trusts
      capable of concerning themselves with the condition of the
      masses instead of the conquest of colonies?


   Finance capital is interested not only in the already discovered
      sources of raw materials but also in potential sources, because
      present-day technical development is extremely rapid, and land
      which is useless today may be improved tomorrow if new methods
      are devised (to this end a big bank can equip a special
      expedition of engineers, agricultural experts, etc.), and if
      large amounts of capital are invested. This also applies to
      prospecting for minerals, to new methods of processing up and
      utilising raw materials, etc., etc. Hence, the inevitable
      striving of finance capital to enlarge its spheres of influence
      and even its actual territory. In the same way that the trusts
      capitalise their property at two or three times its value,
      taking into account its “potential” (and not actual) profits and
      the further results of monopoly, so finance capital in general
      strives to seize the largest possible amount of land of all
      kinds in all places, and by every means, taking into account
      potential sources of raw materials and fearing to be left behind
      in the fierce struggle for the last remnants of independent
      territory, or for the repartition of those territories that have
      been already divided.


   The British capitalists are exerting every effort to develop
      cotton growing in their colony, Egypt (in 1904, out of
      2,300,000 hectares of land under cultivation, 600,000, or more
      than one-fourth, were under cotton); the Russians are doing the
      same in their colony, Turkestan, because in this way
      they will be in a better position to defeat their foreign
      competitors, to monopolise the sources of raw materials and form
      a more economical and profitable textile trust in which all
      the processes of cotton production and manufacturing will
      be “combined” and concentrated in the hands of one set of
      owners.


   The interests pursued in exporting capital also give an impetus
      to the conquest of colonies, for in the colonial market it is
      easier to employ monopoly methods (and sometimes they are the
      only methods that can be employed) to eliminate competition, to
      ensure supplies, to secure the necessary “connections,” etc.


   The non-economic superstructure which grows up on the basis of
      finance capital, its politics and its ideology, stimulates the
      striving for colonial conquest. “Finance capital does not want
      liberty, it wants domination,” as Hilferding very truly
      says. And a French bourgeois writer, developing and
      supplementing, as it were, the ideas of Cecil Rhodes quoted
above,[7]

writes that social causes should be added to the
      economic causes of modern colonial policy: “Owing to the growing
      complexities of life and the difficulties which weigh not only
      on the masses of the workers, but also on the middle classes,
      ‘impatience, irritation and hatred are accumulating in all the
      countries of the old civilisation and are becoming a menace to
      public order; the energy which is being hurled out of the
      definite class channel must be given employment abroad in order
      to avert an explosion at
home’.” [8]


   Since we are speaking of colonial policy in the epoch of
      capitalist imperialism, it must be observed that finance capital
      and its foreign policy, which is the struggle of the great
      powers for the economic and political division of the world,
      give rise to a number of transitional forms of state
      dependence. Not only are the two main groups of countries, those
      owning colonies, and the colonies themselves, but also the
      diverse forms of dependent countries which, politically, are
      formally independent, but in fact, are enmeshed in the net of
      financial and diplomatic dependence, typical of this epoch. We
      have already referred to one form of dependence—the
      semi-colony. An example of another is provided by Argentina.


   “South America, and especially Argentina,” writes
      Schulze-Gaevernitz in his work on British imperialism, “is so
      dependent financially on London that it ought to be described as
      almost a British commercial
colony.” [9]

Basing himself on
      the reports of the Austro-Hungarian Consul at Buenos Aires for
      1909, Schilder estimated the amount of British capital invested
      in Argentina at 8,750 million francs. It is not difficult to
      imagine what strong connections British finance capital (and its
      faithful “friend”, diplomacy) thereby acquires with the
      Argentine bourgeoisie, with the circles that control the whole
      of that country’s economic and political life.


   A somewhat different form of financial and diplomatic
      dependence, accompanied by political independence, is presented
      by Portugal. Portugal is an independent sovereign state, but
      actually, for more than two hundred years, since the war of the
      Spanish Succession (1701-14), it has been a British
      protectorate. Great Britain has protected Portugal and her
      colonies in order to fortify her own positions in the fight
      against her rivals, Spain and France. In return Great Britain
      has received commercial privileges, preferential conditions for
      importing goods and especially capital into Portugal and the
      Portuguese colonies, the right to use the ports and islands of
      Portugal, her telegraph cables, etc.,
etc. [10]

Relations of this
      kind have always existed between big and little states, but in
      the epoch of capitalist imperialism they become a general
      system, they form part of the sum total of “divide the world”
      relations and become links in the chain of operations of world
      finance capital.


   In order to finish with the question of the division of the
      world, I must make the following additional observation. This
      question was raised quite openly and definitely not only in
      American literature after the Spanish-American War, and in
      English literature after the Anglo-Boer War, at the very end of
      the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; not
      only has German literature, which has “most jealously” watched
      “British imperialism,” systematically given its appraisal of
      this fact. This question has also been raised in French
      bourgeois literature as definitely and broadly as is thinkable
      from the bourgeois point of view. Let me quote Driault, the
      historian, who, in his book, Political and Social Problems
      at the End of the Nineteenth Century, in the chapter “The
      Great Powers and the Division of the World,” wrote the
      following: “During the past few years, all the free territory of
      the globe, with the exception of China, has been occupied by the
      powers of Europe and North America. This has already brought
      about several conflicts and shifts of spheres of influence, and
      these foreshadow more terrible upheavals in the near future. For
      it is necessary to make haste. The nations which have not yet
      made provision for themselves run the risk of never receiving
      their share and never participating in the tremendous
      exploitation of the globe which will be one of the most
      essential features of the next century (i.e., the
      twentieth). That is why all Europe and America have lately been
      afflicted with the fever of colonial expansion, of
      ‘imperialism’, that most noteworthy feature of the end of the
      nineteenth century.” And the author added: “In  this partition
      of the world, in this furious hunt for the treasures and the big
      markets of the globe, the relative strength of the empires
      founded in this nineteenth century is totally out of proportion
      to the place occupied in Europe by the nations which founded
      them. The dominant powers in Europe, the arbiters of her
      destiny, are not equally preponderant in the whole
      world. And, as colonial might, the hope of controlling as yet
      unassessed wealth, will evidently react upon the relative
      strength of the European powers, the colonial question—“imperialism,” 
  if you will—which has already modified the
      political conditions of Europe itself, will modify them more and
      more.” [11]

Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



VII. IMPERIALISM AS A SPECIAL STAGE OF CAPITALISM

We must now try to sum up, to draw together the threads of what
      has been said above on the subject of imperialism. Imperialism
      emerged as the development and direct continuation of the
      fundamental characteristics of capitalism in general. But
      capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and
      very high stage of its development, when certain of its
      fundamental characteristics began to change into their
      opposites, when the features of the epoch of transition from
      capitalism to a higher social and economic system had taken
      shape and revealed themselves in all spheres. Economically, the
      main thing in this process is the displacement of capitalist
      free competition by capitalist monopoly. Free competition is the
      basic feature of capitalism, and of commodity production
      generally; monopoly is the exact opposite of free competition,
      but we have seen the latter being transformed into monopoly
      before our eyes, creating large-scale industry and forcing out
      small industry, replacing large-scale by still larger-scale
      industry, and carrying concentration of production and capital
      to the point where out of it has grown and is growing monopoly:
      cartels, syndicates and trusts, and merging with them, the
      capital

   

of a dozen or so banks, which manipulate thousands of
      millions. At the same time the monopolies, which have grown out
      of free competition, do not eliminate the latter, but exist
      above it and alongside it, and thereby give rise to a number of
      very acute, intense antagonisms, frictions and
      conflicts. Monopoly is the transition from capitalism to a
      higher system.


If it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of
      imperialism we should have to say that imperialism is the
      monopoly stage of capitalism. Such a definition would include
      what is most important, for, on the one hand, finance capital is
      the bank capital of a few very big monopolist banks, merged with
      the capital of the monopolist associations of industrialists;
      and, on the other hand, the division of the world is the
      transition from a colonial policy which has extended without
      hindrance to territories unseized by any capitalist power, to a
      colonial policy of monopolist possession of the territory of the
      world, which has been completely divided up.


But very brief definitions, although convenient, for they sum up
      the main points, are nevertheless inadequate, since we have to
      deduce from them some especially important features of the
      phenomenon that has to be defined. And so, without forgetting
      the conditional and relative value of all definitions in
      general, which can never embrace all the concatenations of a
      phenomenon in its full development, we must give a definition of
      imperialism that will include the following five of its basic
      features:


(1) the concentration of production and capital has developed to
          such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play
          a decisive role in economic life;
(2) the merging of bank
          capital with industrial capital, and the creation, on the
          basis of this “finance capital,” of a financial oligarchy;
(3) the export of capital as distinguished from the export
          of commodities acquires exceptional importance;
(4) the
          formation of international monopolist capitalist
          associations which share the world among themselves and
(5)
          the territorial division of the whole world among the
          biggest capitalist powers is completed. Imperialism is
          capitalism at that stage of development at which the
          dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established;
          in

   

which the export of capital has acquired pronounced
          importance; in which the division of the world among the
          international trusts has begun, in which the division of all
          territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers
          has been completed.


We shall see later that imperialism can and must be defined
      differently if we bear in mind not only the basic, purely
      economic concepts—to which the above definition is
      limited—but also the historical place of this stage of
      capitalism in relation to capitalism in general, or the relation
      between imperialism and the two main trends in the working-class
      movement. The thing to be noted at this point is that
      imperialism, as interpreted above, undoubtedly represents a
      special stage in the development of capitalism. To enable the
      reader to obtain the most well-grounded idea of imperialism, I
      deliberately tried to quote as extensively as possible
      bourgeois economists who have to admit the particularly
      incontrovertible facts concerning the latest stage of capitalist
      economy. With the same object in view, I have quoted detailed
      statistics which enable one to see to what degree bank capital,
      etc., has grown, in what precisely the transformation of
      quantity into quality, of developed capitalism into imperialism,
      was expressed. Needless to say, of course, all boundaries in
      nature and in society are conventional and changeable, and it
      would be absurd to argue, for example, about the particular year
      or decade in which imperialism “definitely” became established.


In the matter of defining imperialism, however, we have to enter
      into controversy, primarily, with Karl Kautsky, the principal
      Marxist theoretician of the epoch of the so-called Second
      International—that is, of the twenty-five years between
      1889 and 1914. The fundamental ideas expressed in our definition
      of imperialism were very resolutely attacked by Kautsky in 1915,
      and even in November 1914, when he said that imperialism must
      not be regarded as a “phase” or stage of economy, but as a
      policy, a definite policy “preferred” by finance capital; that
      imperialism must not be “identified” with “present-day
      capitalism”; that if imperialism is to be understood to mean
      “all the phenomena of present-day capitalism”—cartels,
      protection, the domination of the financiers, and colonial
      policy—then the

   

question as to whether imperialism is
      necessary to capitalism becomes reduced to the “flattest
      tautology”, because, in that case, “imperialism is naturally a
      vital necessity for capitalism”, and so on. The best way to
      present Kautsky’s idea is to quote his own definition of
      imperialism, which is diametrically opposed to the substance of
      the ideas which I have set forth (for the objections coming from
      the camp of the German Marxists, who have been advocating
      similar ideas for many years already, have been long known to
      Kautsky as the objections of a definite trend in Marxism).


Kautsky’s definition is as follows:


“Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial
      capitalism. It consists in the striving of every industrial
      capitalist nation to bring under its control or to annex all
      large areas of agrarian [Kautsky’s italics] territory,
      irrespective of what nations inhabit
it.” [1]


This definition is of no use at all because it one-sidedly,
      i.e., arbitrarily, singles out only the national question
      (although the latter is extremely important in itself as well as
      in its relation to imperialism), it arbitrarily and
      inaccurately connects this question only with
      industrial capital in the countries which annex other nations,
      and in an equally arbitrary and inaccurate manner pushes into
      the forefront the annexation of agrarian regions.


Imperialism is a striving for annexations—this is what
      the political part of Kautsky’s definition amounts
      to. It is correct, but very incomplete, for politically,
      imperialism is, in general, a striving towards violence and
      reaction. For the moment, however, we are interested in the
      economic aspect of the question, which Kautsky
      himself introduced into his definition. The
      inaccuracies in Kautsky’s definition are glaring. The
      characteristic feature of imperialism is not industrial but
      finance capital. It is not an accident that in France it
      was precisely the extraordinarily rapid development of
      finance capital, and the weakening of industrial
      capital, that from the eighties onwards gave rise to the extreme
      intensification of annexationist (colonial) policy. The
      characteristic feature of imperialism is precisely

   

that it
      strives to annex not only agrarian territories, but
      even most highly industrialised regions (German appetite for
      Belgium; French appetite for Lorraine), because (1) the fact
      that the world is already partitioned obliges those
      contemplating a redivision to reach out for every
      kind of territory, and (2) an essential feature of
      imperialism is the rivalry between several great powers in the
      striving for hegemony, i.e., for the conquest of territory, not
      so much directly for themselves as to weaken the adversary and
      undermine his hegemony. (Belgium is particularly
      important for Germany as a base for operations against Britain;
      Britain needs Baghdad as a base for operations against Germany,
      etc.)


Kautsky refers especially—and repeatedly—to
      English writers who, he alleges, have given a purely political
      meaning to the word “imperialism” in the sense that he, Kautsky,
      understands it. We take up the work by the English writer
      Hobson, Imperialism, which appeared in 1902, and there
      we read:


“The new imperialism differs from the older, first, in
      substituting for the ambition of a single growing empire the
      theory and the practice of competing empires, each motivated by
      similar lusts of political aggrandisement and commercial gain;
      secondly, in the dominance of financial or investing over
      mercantile
interests.” [2]


We see that Kautsky is absolutely wrong in referring to English
      writers generally (unless he meant the vulgar English
      imperialists, or the avowed apologists for imperialism). We see
      that Kautsky, while claiming that he continues to advocate
      Marxism, as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with
      the social-liberal Hobson, who more correctly
      takes into account two “historically concrete” (Kautsky’s
      definition is a mockery of historical concreteness!) features of
      modern imperialism: (1) the competition between several
      imperialisms, and (2) the predominance of the financier
      over the merchant. If it is chiefly a question of the annexation
      of agrarian countries by industrial countries, then the role of
      the merchant is put in the forefront.



Kautsky’s definition is not only wrong and un-Marxist. It serves
      as a basis for a whole system of views which signify a rupture
      with Marxist theory and Marxist practice all along the line. I
      shall refer to this later. The argument about words which
      Kautsky raises as to whether the latest stage of capitalism
      should be called imperialism or the stage of finance capital is
      not worth serious attention. Call it what you will, it makes no
      difference. The essence of the matter is that Kautsky detaches
      the politics of imperialism from its economics, speaks of
      annexations as being a policy “preferred” by finance capital,
      and opposes to it another bourgeois policy which, he alleges, is
      possible on this very same basis of finance capital. It follows,
      then, that monopolies in the economy are compatible with
      non-monopolistic, non-violent, non-annexationist methods in
      politics. It follows, then, that the territorial division of the
      world, which was completed during this very epoch of finance
      capital, and which constitutes the basis of the present peculiar
      forms of rivalry between the biggest capitalist states, is
      compatible with a non-imperialist policy. The result is a
      slurring-over and a blunting of the most profound contradictions
      of the latest stage of capitalism, instead of an exposure of
      their depth; the result is bourgeois reformism instead of
      Marxism.


Kautsky enters into controversy with the German apologist of
      imperialism and annexations, Cunow, who clumsily and cynically
      argues that imperialism is present-day capitalism; the
      development of capitalism is inevitable and progressive;
      therefore imperialism is progressive; therefore, we should
      grovel before it and glorify it! This is something like the
      caricature of the Russian Marxists which the Narodniks drew in
      1894-95. They argued: if the Marxists believe that capitalism is
      inevitable in Russia, that it is progressive, then they ought to
      open a tavern and begin to implant capitalism! Kautsky’s reply
      to Cunow is as follows: imperialism is not present-day
      capitalism; it is only one of the forms of the policy of
      present-day capitalism. This policy we can and should fight,
      fight imperialism, annexations, etc.


The reply seems quite plausible, but in effect it is a more
      subtle and more disguised (and therefore more dangerous)
      advocacy of conciliation with imperialism, because a

   

“fight”
      against the policy of the trusts and banks that does not affect
      the economic basis of the trusts and banks is mere bourgeois
      reformism and pacifism, the benevolent and innocent expression
      of pious wishes. Evasion of existing contradictions, forgetting
      the most important of them, instead of revealing their full
      depth—such is Kautsky’s theory, which has nothing in
      common with Marxism. Naturally, such a “theory” can only serve
      the purpose of advocating unity with the Cunows!


“From the purely economic point of view,” writes Kautsky, “it is
      not impossible that capitalism will yet go through a new phase,
      that of the extension of the policy of the cartels to foreign
      policy, the phase of
ultra-imperialism,” [3]

i.e., of a
      superimperialism, of a union of the imperialisms of the whole
      world and not struggles among them, a phase when wars shall
      cease under capitalism, a phase of “the joint exploitation of
      the world by internationally united finance
capital.” [4]


We shall have to deal with this “theory of ultra-imperialism”
      later on in order to show in detail how decisively and
      completely it breaks with Marxism. At present, in keeping with
      the general plan of the present work, we must examine the exact
      economic data on this question. “From the purely economic point
      of view,” is “ultra-imperialism” possible, or is it
      ultra-nonsense?


If the purely economic point of view is meant to be a “pure”
      abstraction, then all that can be said reduces itself to the
      following proposition: development is proceeding towards
      monopolies, hence, towards a single world monopoly, towards a
      single world trust. This is indisputable, but it is also as
      completely meaningless as is the statement that “development is
      proceeding” towards the manufacture of foodstuffs in
      laboratories. In this sense the “theory” of ultra-imperialism is
      no less absurd than a “theory of ultra-agriculture” would be.


If, however, we are discussing the “purely economic” conditions
      of the epoch of finance capital as a historically concrete epoch
      which began at the turn of the twentieth

   

century, then the best
      reply that one can make to the lifeless abstractions of
      “ultra-imperialism” (which serve exclusively a most reactionary
      aim: that of diverting attention from the depth of existing
      antagonisms) is to contrast them with the concrete economic
      realities of the present-day world economy. Kautsky’s utterly
      meaningless talk about ultra-imperialism encourages, among other
      things, that profoundly mistaken idea which only brings grist to
      the mill of the apologists of imperialism, i.e., that the rule
      of finance capital lessens the unevenness and
      contradictions inherent in the world economy, whereas in reality
      it increases them.


R. Calwer, in his little book, An Introduction to the World
      Economy, [5]

made an attempt to summarise the
      main, purely economic, data that enable one to obtain a concrete
      picture of the internal relations of the world economy at the
      turn of the twentieth century. He divides the world into five
      “main economic areas”, as follows: (1) Central Europe (the whole
      of Europe with the exception of Russia and Great Britain); (2)
      Great Britain; (3) Russia; (4) Eastern Asia; (5) America; he
      includes the colonies in the “areas” of the states to which they
      belong and “leaves aside” a few countries not distributed
      according to areas, such as Persia, Afghanistan, and Arabia in
      Asia, Morocco and Abyssinia in Africa, etc.


Here is a brief summary of the economic data he quotes on these regions.

NOTE: The figures in parentheses show the area and
population of the colonies.




We see three areas of highly developed capitalism (high
      development of means of transport, of trade and of industry):
      the Central European, the British and the American areas. Among
      these are three states which dominate the world: Germany, Great
      Britain, and the United States. Imperialist rivalry and the
      struggle between these countries have become extremely keen
      because Germany has only an insignificant area and few colonies;
      the creation of “Central Europe” is still a matter for the
      future, it is being born in the midst of a desperate
      struggle. For the moment the distinctive feature of the whole of
      Europe is political disunity. In the British and American areas,
      on the other hand, political concentration is very highly
      developed, but there is a vast disparity between the immense
      colonies of the one and the insignificant colonies of the
      other. In the colonies, however, capitalism is only beginning to
      develop. The struggle for South America is becoming more and
      more acute.


There are two areas where capitalism is little developed: Russia
      and Eastern Asia. In the former, the population is extremely
      sparse, in the latter it is extremely dense; in the former
      political concentration is high, in the latter it does not
      exist. The partitioning of China is only just beginning, and the
      struggle for it between Japan, the U.S., etc., is continually
      gaining in intensity.


Compare this reality—the vast diversity of economic and
      political conditions, the extreme disparity in the rate of
      development of the various countries, etc., and the violent
      struggles among the imperialist states—with Kautsky’s
      silly little fable about “peaceful” ultra-imperialism. Is this
      not the reactionary attempt of a frightened philistine to hide
      from stern reality? Are not the international cartels which
      Kautsky imagines are the embryos of “ultra-imperialism” (in the
      same way as one “can” describe the manufacture of tablets in a
      laboratory as ultra-agriculture in embryo) an example of the
      division and the redivision of the world, the
      transition from peaceful division to non-peaceful division and
      vice versa? Is not American and other finance capital, which
      divided the whole world peacefully with Germany’s participation
      in, for example, the international rail syndicate, or in the
      international mercantile

   

shipping trust, now engaged in
      redividing the world on the basis of a new relation of
      forces that is being changed by methods anything but
      peaceful?


Finance capital and the trusts do not diminish but increase the
      differences in the rate of growth of the various parts of the
      world economy. Once the relation of forces is changed, what
      other solution of the contradictions can be found under
      capitalism than that of force? Railway
statistics [6]

provide
      remarkably exact data on the different rates of growth of
      capitalism and finance capital in world economy. In the last
      decades of imperialist development, the total length of railways
      has changed as follows:




 
Railways (000 kilometers)

43

+94


Total
617
 
1,104
 
 
 




Thus, the development of railways has been most rapid in the
      colonies and in the independent (and semi-independent) states of
      Asia and America. Here, as we know, the finance capital of the
      four or five biggest capitalist states holds undisputed
      sway. Two hundred thousand kilometres of new railways in the
      colonies and in the other countries of Asia and America
      represent a capital of more than 40,000 million marks newly
      invested on particularly advantageous terms, with special
      guarantees of a good return and with profitable orders for steel
      works, etc., etc.


Capitalism is growing with the greatest rapidity in the colonies
      and in overseas countries. Among the latter, new imperialist
      powers are emerging (e.g., Japan). The struggle

   

among the world
      imperialisms is becoming more acute. The tribute levied by
      finance capital on the most profitable colonial and overseas
      enterprises is increasing. In the division of this “booty,” an
      exceptionally large part goes to countries which do not always
      stand at the top of the list in the rapidity of the development
      of their productive forces. In the case of the biggest
      countries, together with their colonies, the total length of
      railways was as follows:




 
(000 kilometres)


1890
1913
 


U.S.
268
413
+145


British Empire

+46


Germany
43
68
+25


France
41
63
+22


Total
491
830
+339




Thus, about 80 per cent of the total existing railways are
      concentrated in the hands of the five biggest powers. But the
      concentration of the ownership of these railways, the
      concentration of finance capital, is immeasurably greater since
      the French and British millionaires, for example, own an
      enormous amount of shares and bonds in American, Russian and
      other railways.


Thanks to her colonies, Great Britain has increased the length
      of “her” railways by 100,000 kilometres, four times as much as
      Germany. And yet, it is well known that the development of
      productive forces in Germany, and especially the development of
      the coal and iron industries, has been incomparably more rapid
      during this period than in Britain—not to speak of France
      and Russia. In 1892, Germany produced 4,900,000 tons of pig-iron
      and Great Britain produced 6,800,000 tons; in 1912, Germany
      produced 17,600,000 tons and Great Britain, 9,000,000
      tons. Germany, therefore, had an overwhelming superiority over
      Britain in this
respect. [7]

The question is: what means other

   

than war could there be under capitalism to overcome
      the disparity between the development of productive forces and
      the accumulation of capital on the one side, and the division of
      colonies and spheres of influence for finance capital on the
      other?

A POPULAR OUTLINE



 
VIII. PARASITISM AND DECAY OF CAPITALISM

We now have to examine yet another significant aspect of
      imperialism to which most of the discussions on the subject
      usually attach insufficient importance. One of the shortcomings
      of the Marxist Hilferding is that on this point he has taken a
      step backward compared with the non-Marxist Hobson. I refer to
      parasitism, which is characteristic of imperialism.


As we have seen, the deepest economic foundation of imperialism
      is monopoly. This is capitalist monopoly, i.e., monopoly which
      has grown out of capitalism and which exists in the general
      environment of capitalism, commodity production and competition,
      in permanent and insoluble contradiction to this general
      environment. Nevertheless, like all monopoly, it inevitably
      engenders a tendency of stagnation and decay. Since monopoly
      prices are established, even temporarily, the motive cause of
      technical and, consequently, of all other progress disappears to
      a certain extent and, further, the economic possibility arises
      of deliberately retarding technical progress. For instance, in
      America, a certain Owens invented a machine which revolutionised
      the manufacture of bottles. The German bottle-manufacturing
      cartel purchased Owens’s patent, but pigeon-holed it, refrained
      from utilising it. Certainly, monopoly under capitalism can
      never completely, and for a very long period of time, eliminate
      competition in the world market (and this, by the by, is one of
      the reasons why the theory of ultra-imperialism is so
      absurd). Certainly, the possibility of reducing the cost of
      production and increasing profits by introducing technical
      improvements operates in the direction of change. But the
      tendency to stagnation and decay, which is characteristic of
      monopoly, continues to operate, and in some branches of
      industry, in some countries, for certain periods of time, it
      gains the upper hand.

 

The monopoly ownership of very extensive, rich or well-situated
      colonies operates in the same direction.


Further, imperialism is an immense accumulation of money capital
      in a few countries, amounting, as we have seen, to
      100,000-150,000 million francs in securities. Hence the
      extraordinary growth of a class, or rather, of a stratum of
      rentiers, i.e., people who live by “clipping coupons,” who take
      no part in any enterprise whatever, whose profession is
      idleness. The export of capital, one of the most essential
      economic bases of imperialism, still more completely isolates
      the rentiers from production and sets the seal of parasitism on
      the whole country that lives by exploiting the labour of several
      overseas countries and colonies.


“In 1893,” writes Hobson, “the British capital invested abroad
      represented about 15 per cent of the total wealth of the United
      Kingdom.”[1]

      Let me remind the reader that by 1915 this capital had increased
      about two and a half times. “Aggressive imperialism,” says
      Hobson further on, “which costs the tax-payer so dear, which is
      of so little value to the manufacturer and trader ... is a
      source of great gain to the investor.... The annual income Great
      Britain derives from commissions in her whole foreign and
      colonial trade, import and export, is estimated by Sir R. Giffen
      at £18,000,000 (nearly 170 million rubles) for 1899, taken
      at 2 1/2 per cent, upon a turnover of £800,000,000.” Great
      as this sum is, it cannot explain the aggressive imperialism of
      Great Britain, which is explained by the income of £90
      million to £100 million from “invested” capital, the
      income of the rentiers.


The income of the rentiers is five times greater than
      the income obtained from the foreign trade of the biggest
      “trading” country in the world! This is the essence of
      imperialism and imperialist parasitism.


For that reason the term “rentier state” (Rentnerstaat), or
      usurer state, is coming into common use in the economic
      literature that deals with imperialism. The world has become
      divided into a handful of usurer states and a vast majority of
      debtor states. “At the top of the list of foreign investments,”
      says Schulze-Gaevernitz, “are those placed

  

in politically
      dependent or allied countries: Great Britain grants loans to
      Egypt, Japan, China and South America. Her navy plays here the
      part of bailiff in case of necessity. Great Britain’s political
      power protects her from the indignation of her
debtors.”[2]

Sartorius
      von Waltershausen in his book, The National Economic System
      of Capital Investments Abroad, cites Holland as the model
      “rentier state” and points out that Great Britain and France are
      now becoming
such.[3]

Schilder is of the opinion that five
      industrial states have become “definitely pronounced creditor
      countries”: Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and
      Switzerland. He does not include Holland in this list simply
      because she is “industrially little
developed.”[4]

The United States is
      a creditor only of the American countries.


“Great Britain,” says Schulze-Gaevernitz, “is gradually becoming
      transformed from an industrial into a creditor
      state. Notwithstanding the absolute increase in industrial
      output and the export of manufactured goods, there is an
      increase in the relative importance of income from interest and
      dividends, issues of securities, commissions and speculation in
      the whole of the national economy. In my opinion it is precisely
      this that forms the economic basis of imperialist
      ascendancy. The creditor is more firmly attached to the debtor
      than the seller is to the
buyer.[5]

In regard to Germany, A. Lansburgh,
      the publisher of the Berlin Die Bank, in 1911, in an
      article entitled “Germany—a Rentier State”, wrote the
      following: “People in Germany are ready to sneer at the yearning
      to become rentiers that is observed in France. But they forget
      that as far as the bourgeoisie is concerned the situation in
      Germany is becoming more and more like that in
France.”[6]


The rentier state is a state of parasitic, decaying capitalism,
      and this circumstance cannot fail to influence all the
      socio-political conditions of the countries concerned, in
      general, and the two fundamental trends in the working-class

  

movement, in particular. To demonstrate this in the clearest
      possible manner let me quote Hobson, who is a most reliable
      witness, since he cannot be suspected of leaning towards Marxist
      orthodoxy; on the other hand, he is an Englishman who is very
      well acquainted with the situation in the country which is
      richest in colonies, in finance capital, and in imperialist
      experience.


With the Anglo-Boer War fresh in his mind, Hobson describes the
      connection between imperialism and the interests of the
      “financiers,” their growing profits from contracts, supplies,
      etc., and writes: “While the directors of this definitely
      parasitic policy are capitalists, the same motives appeal to
      special classes of the workers. In many towns most important
      trades are dependent upon government employment or contracts;
      the imperialism of the metal and shipbuilding centres is
      attributable in no small degree to this fact.” Two sets of
      circumstances, in this writer’s opinion, have weakened the old
      empires: (1) “economic parasitism,” and (2) the formation of
      armies recruited from subject peoples. “There is first the habit
      of economic parasitism, by which the ruling state has used its
      provinces, colonies, and dependencies in order to enrich its
      ruling class and to bribe its lower classes into
      acquiescence.” And I shall add that the economic possibility of
      such bribery, whatever its form may be, requires high monopolist
      profits.


As for the second circumstance, Hobson writes: “One of the
      strangest symptoms of the blindness of imperialism is the
      reckless indifference with which Great Britain, France and other
      imperial nations are embarking on this perilous
      dependence. Great Britain has gone farthest. Most of the
      fighting by which we have won our Indian Empire has been done by
      natives; in India, as more recently in Egypt, great standing
      armies are placed under British commanders; almost all the
      fighting associated with our African dominions, except in the
      southern part, has been done for us by natives.”


Hobson gives the following economic appraisal of the prospect of
      the partitioning of China: “The greater part of Western Europe
      might then assume the appearance and character already exhibited
      by tracts of country in the

  

South of England, in the Riviera and
      in the tourist-ridden or residential parts of Italy and
      Switzerland, little clusters of wealthy aristocrats drawing
      dividends and pensions from the Far East, with a somewhat larger
      group of professional retainers and tradesmen and a larger body
      of personal servants and workers in the transport trade and in
      the final stages of production of the more perishable goods; all
      the main arterial industries would have disappeared, the staple
      foods and manufactures flowing in as tribute from Asia and
      Africa. . . . We have foreshadowed the possibility of even a
      larger alliance of Western states, a European federation of
      great powers which, so far from forwarding the cause of world
      civilisation, might introduce the gigantic peril of a Western
      parasitism, a group of advanced industrial nations, whose upper
      classes drew vast tribute from Asia and Africa, with which they
      supported great tame masses of retainers, no longer engaged in
      the staple industries of agriculture and manufacture, but kept
      in the performance of personal or minor industrial services
      under the control of a new financial aristocracy. Let those who
      would scout such a theory (it would be better to say: prospect)
      as undeserving of consideration examine the economic and social
      condition of districts in Southern England today which are
      already reduced to this condition, and reflect upon the vast
      extension of such a system which might be rendered feasible by
      the subjection of China to the economic control of similar
      groups of financiers, investors, and political and business
      officials, draining the greatest potential reservoir of profit
      the world has ever known, in order to consume it in Europe. The
      situation is far too complex, the play of world forces far too
      incalculable, to render this or any other single interpretation
      of the future very probable; but the influences which govern the
      imperialism of Western Europe today are moving in this
      direction, and, unless counteracted or diverted, make towards
      some such
consummation.”[7]


The author is quite right: if the forces of imperialism had not
      been counteracted they would have led precisely to what he has
      described. The significance of a “United States of Europe” in
      the present imperialist situation is

  

correctly appraised. He
      should have added, however, that, also within the
      working-class movement, the opportunists, who are for the moment
      victorious in most countries, are “working” systematically and
      undeviatingly in this very direction. Imperialism, which means
      the partitioning of the world, and the exploitation of other
      countries besides China, which means high monopoly profits for a
      handful of very rich countries, makes it economically possible
      to bribe the upper strata of the proletariat, and thereby
      fosters, gives shape to, and strengthens opportunism. We must
      not, however, lose sight of the forces which counteract
      imperialism in general, and opportunism in particular, and
      which, naturally, the social-liberal Hobson is unable to
      perceive.


The German opportunist, Gerhard Hildebrand, who was once
      expelled from the Party for defending imperialism, and who could
      today be a leader of the so-called “Social-Democratic” Party of
      Germany, supplements Hobson well by his advocacy of a “United
      States of Western Europe” (without Russia) for the purpose of
      “joint” action ... against the African Negroes, against the
      “great Islamic movement,” for the maintenance of a “powerful
      army and navy”, against a “Sino-Japanese
coalition,”[8]

etc.


The description of “British imperialism” in Schulze-Gaevernitz’s
      book reveals the same parasitical traits. The national income of
      Great Britain approximately doubled from 1865 to 1898, while the
      income “from abroad” increased nine-fold in the same
      period. While the “merit” of imperialism is that it “trains the
      Negro to habits of industry” (you cannot manage without coercion
      ... ), the “danger” of imperialism lies in that “Europe will
      shift the burden of physical toil—first agricultural and
      mining, then the rougher work in industry—on to the
      coloured races, and itself be content with the role of rentier,
      and in this way, perhaps, pave the way for the economic, and
      later, the political emancipation of the coloured races.”


An increasing proportion of land in England is being taken out
      of cultivation and used for sport, for the diversion

  

of the
rich. As far as Scotland—the most aristocratic place for
      hunting and other sports—is concerned, it is said that
      “it lives on its past and on Mr. Carnegie” (the American
      multimillionaire). On horse racing and fox hunting alone England
      annually spends £14,000,000 (nearly 130 million
      rubles). The number of rentiers in England is about one
      million. The percentage of the productively employed population
      to the total population is declining:




 
PopulationEngland and
      Wales (000,000)

      industries(000,000)

And in speaking of the British working class the bourgeois
      student of “British imperialism at the beginning of the
      twentieth century” is obliged to distinguish systematically
      between the “upper stratum” of the workers and the
      “lower stratum of the proletariat proper.” The
      upper stratum furnishes the bulk of the membership of
      co-operatives, of trade unions, of sporting clubs and of
      numerous religious sects. To this level is adapted the electoral
      system, which in Great Britain is still “sufficiently
      restricted to exclude the lower stratum of the proletariat
      proper"! In order to present the condition of the British
      working class in a rosy light, only this upper stratum—which
      constitutes a minority of the proletariat—is usually
      spoken of. For instance, “the problem of unemployment
      is mainly a London problem and that of the lower
      proletarian stratum, to which the politicians attach little
      importance...”[9]

He should have said: to which
      the bourgeois politicians and the “socialist” opportunists
      attach little importance.


One of the special features of imperialism connected with the
      facts I am describing, is the decline in emigration from
      imperialist countries and the increase in immigration into these
      countries from the more backward countries where lower wages are
      paid. As Hobson observes, emigration from Great Britain has been
      declining since 1884. In that year the number of emigrants was
      242,000,

  

while in 1900, the number was 169,000. Emigration from
      Germany reached the highest point between 1881 and 1890, with a
      total of 1,453,000 emigrants. In the course of the following two
      decades, it fell to 544,000 and to 341,000. On the other hand,
      there was an increase in the number of workers entering Germany
      from Austria, Italy, Russia and other countries. According to
      the 1907 census, there were 1,342,294 foreigners in Germany, of
      whom 440,800 were industrial workers and 257,329 agricultural
workers.[10]

In France, the workers employed in
      the mining industry are, “in great part,” foreigners: Poles,
      Italians and
Spaniards.[11]

In the United States, immigrants
      from Eastern and Southern Europe are engaged in the most poorly
      paid jobs, while American workers provide the highest percentage
      of overseers or of the better-paid
workers.[12]

Imperialism has
      the tendency to  create privileged sections also among the
      workers, and to detach them from the broad masses of the
      proletariat.


It must be observed that in Great Britain the tendency of
      imperialism to split the workers, to strengthen opportunism
      among them and to cause temporary decay in the working-class
      movement, revealed itself much earlier than the end of the
      nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries; for two
      important distinguishing features of imperialism were already
      observed in Great Britain in the middle of the nineteenth
      century—vast colonial possessions and a monopolist
      position in the world market. Marx and Engels traced this
      connection between opportunism in the working-class movement and
      the imperialist features of British capitalism systematically,
      during the course of several decades. For example, on October 7,
      1858, Engels wrote to Marx: “The English proletariat is actually
      becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois of
      all nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of
      a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat
      alongside the bourgeoisie. For a nation which exploits
      the whole world this is of course to a certain extent
justifiable.”[13] Almost a quarter of a century later, in

  

a letter
      dated August 11, 1881, Engels speaks of the “worst English trade
      unions which allow themselves to be led by men sold to, or at
      least paid by, the middle class”. In a letter to Kautsky, dated
      September 12, 1882, Engels wrote: “You ask me what the English
      workers think about colonial policy. Well, exactly the same as
      they think about politics in general. There is no workers’ party
      here, there are only Conservatives and Liberal-Radicals, and the
      workers gaily share the feast of England’s monopoly of the world
      market and the
colonies.”[13]

(Engels expressed similar ideas in
      the press in his preface to the second edition of The
      Condition of the Working Class in England, which appeared
      in 1892.)


This clearly shows the causes and effects. The causes are: (1)
      exploitation of the whole world by this country; (2) its
      monopolist position in the world market; (3) its colonial
      monopoly. The effects are: (1) a section of the British
      proletariat becomes bourgeois; (2) a section of the proletariat
      allows itself to be led by men bought by, or at least paid by,
      the bourgeoisie. The imperialism of the beginning of the
      twentieth century completed the division of the world among a
      handful of states, each of which today exploits (in the sense of
      drawing superprofits from) a part of the “whole world” only a
      little smaller than that which England exploited in 1858; each
      of them occupies a monopolist position in the world market
      thanks to trusts, cartels, finance capital and creditor and
      debtor relations; each of them enjoys to some degree a colonial
      monopoly (we have seen that out of the total of 75,000,000
      sq. km., which comprise the whole colonial world,
      65,000,000 sq. km., or 86 per cent, belong to six
      powers; 61,000,000 sq. km., or 81 per cent, belong to
      three powers).


The distinctive feature of the present situation is the
      prevalence of such economic and political conditions that are
      bound to increase the irreconcilability between opportunism and
      the general and vital interests of the working-class movement:
      imperialism has grown from an embryo into the predominant
      system; capitalist monopolies occupy

  

first place in economics
      and politics; the division of the world has been completed; on
      the other hand, instead of the undivided monopoly of Great
      Britain, we see a few imperialist powers contending for the
      right to share in this monopoly, and this struggle is
      characteristic of the whole period of the early twentieth
      century. Opportunism cannot now be completely triumphant in the
      working-class movement of one country for decades as it was in
      Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century; but in a
      number of countries it has grown ripe, overripe, and rotten, and
      has become completely merged with bourgeois policy in the form
      of
“social-chauvinism”.[14]

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



IX. CRITIQUE OF IMPERIALISM

By the critique of imperialism, in the broad sense of the term,
    we mean the attitude of the different classes of society towards
    imperialist policy in connection with their general ideology.


The enormous dimensions of finance capital concentrated in a
    few hands and creating an extraordinarily dense and widespread
    network of relationships and connections which subordinates not
    only the small and medium, but also the very small capitalists and
    small masters, on the one hand, and the increasingly intense
    struggle waged against other national state groups of financiers
    for the division of the world and domination over other countries,
    on the other hand, cause the propertied classes to go over
    entirely to the side of imperialism. “General” enthusiasm over the
    prospects of imperialism, furious defence of it and painting it in
    the brightest colours—such are the signs of the
    times. Imperialist ideology also penetrates the working class. No
    Chinese Wall separates it from the other classes. The leaders of
    the present-day, so-called, “Social-Democratic” Party of Germany
    are justly called “social-imperialists,” that is, socialists in
    words and imperialists in deeds; but

   

as early as 1902, Hobson
    noted the existence in Britain of “Fabian imperialists” who
    belonged to the opportunist Fabian Society.


Bourgeois scholars and publicists usually come out in defence
    of imperialism in a somewhat veiled form; they obscure its
    complete domination and its deep-going roots, strive to push
    specific and secondary details into the forefront and do their
    very best to distract attention from essentials by means of
    absolutely ridiculous schemes for “reform,” such as police
    supervision of the trusts or banks, etc. Cynical and frank
    imperialists who are bold enough to admit the absurdity of the
    idea of reforming the fundamental characteristics of imperialism
    are a rarer phenomenon.


Here is an example. The German imperialists attempt, in the
    magazine Archives of World Economy, to follow the
    national emancipation movements in the colonies, particularly, of
    course, in colonies other than those belonging to Germany. They
    note the unrest and the protest movements in India, the movement
    in Natal (South Africa), in the Dutch East Indies, etc. One of
    them, commenting on an English report of a conference held on June
    28-30, 1910, of representatives of various subject nations and
    races, of peoples of Asia, Africa and Europe who are under foreign
    rule, writes as follows in appraising the speeches delivered at
    this conference: “We are told that we must fight imperialism; that
    the ruling states should recognise the right of subject peoples to
    independence; that an international tribunal should supervise the
    fulfilment of treaties concluded between the great powers and weak
    peoples. Further than the expression of these pious wishes they do
    not go. We see no trace of understanding of the fact that
    imperialism is inseparably bound up with capitalism in its present
    form and that, therefore [!!], an open struggle against
    imperialism would be hopeless, unless, perhaps, the fight were to
    be confined to protests against certain of its especially
    abhorrent
excesses.” [1]

Since the reform of the basis of
    imperialism is a deception, a “pious wish”, since the bourgeois
    representatives of the oppressed nations go no

   

“further” forward,
    the bourgeois representative of an oppressing nation goes
    “further” backward, to servility towards imperialism
    under cover of the claim to be “scientific.” That is also
    “logic”!


The questions as to whether it is possible to reform the basis
    of imperialism, whether to go forward to the further
    intensification and deepening of the antagonisms which it
    engenders, or backward, towards allaying these antagonisms, are
    fundamental questions in the critique of imperialism. Since the
    specific political features of imperialism are reaction everywhere
    and increased national oppression due to the oppression of the
    financial oligarchy and the elimination of free competition, a
    petty-bourgeois-democratic opposition to imperialism arose at
    the beginning of the twentieth century in nearly all imperialist
    countries. Kautsky not only did not trouble to oppose, was not
    only unable to oppose this petty-bourgeois reformist opposition,
    which is really reactionary in its economic basis, but became
    merged with it in practice, and this is precisely where Kautsky
    and the broad international Kautskian trend deserted Marxism.


In the United States, the imperialist war waged against Spain
    in 1898 stirred up the opposition of the “anti-imperialists,” the
    last of the Mohicans of bourgeois democracy who declared this war
    to be “criminal,” regarded the annexation of foreign territories
    as a violation of the Constitution, declared that the treatment of
    Aguinaldo, leader of the Filipinos (the Americans promised him the
    independence of his country, but later landed troops and annexed
    it), was “jingo treachery”, and quoted the words of Lincoln: “When
    the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when
    he governs himself and also governs others, it is no longer
    self-government; it is
despotism.” [2]

But as long as all this criticism
    shrank from recognising the inseverable bond between imperialism
    and the trusts, and, therefore, between imperialism and the
    foundations of capitalism, while it shrank from joining the forces
    engendered by large-scale capitalism and its development, it
    remained a “pious wish”.



This is also the main attitude taken by Hobson in his critique
    of imperialism. Hobson anticipated Kautsky in protesting against
    the “inevitability of imperialism” argument, and in urging the
    necessity of “increasing the consuming capacity” of the people
    (under capitalism!). The petty-bourgeois point of view in the
    critique of imperialism, the omnipotence of the banks, the
    financial oligarchy, etc., is adopted by the authors I have often
    quoted, such as Agahd, A. Lansburgh, L. Eschwege, and among the
    French writers Victor Berard, author of a superficial book
    entitled England and Imperialism which appeared in
    1900. All these authors, who make no claim to be Marxists,
    contrast imperialism with free competition and democracy, condemn
    the Baghdad railway scheme, which is leading to conflicts and war,
    utter “pious wishes” for peace, etc. This applies also to the
    compiler of international stock and share issue statistics,
    A. Neymarck, who, after calculating the thousands of millions of
    francs representing “international” securities, exclaimed in 1912:
    “Is it possible to believe that peace may be disturbed ... that,
    in the face of these enormous figures, anyone would risk starting
    a
war?” [3]


Such simple-mindedness on the part of the bourgeois economists
    is not surprising; moreover, it is in their interest to
    pretend to be so naive and to talk “seriously” about peace under
    imperialism. But what remains of Kautsky’s Marxism, when, in 1914,
    1915 and 1916, he takes up the same bourgeois-reformist point of
    view and affirms that “everybody is agreed” (imperialists, 
pseudo-socialists and social-pacifists) on the matter of peace? Instead
    of an analysis of imperialism and an exposure of the depths of its
    contradictions, we have nothing but a reformist “pious wish” to
    wave them aside, to evade them.


Here is a sample of Kautsky’s economic criticism of
    imperialism. He takes the statistics of the British export and
    import trade with Egypt for 1872 and 1912; it seems that this
    export and import trade has grown more slowly than British foreign
    trade as a whole. From this Kautsky concludes that “we have no
    reason to suppose that without

   

military occupation the growth of
    British trade with Egypt would have been less, simply as a result
    of the mere operation of economic factors.” “The urge of capital
    to expand ... can be best promoted, not by the violent methods of
    imperialism, but by peaceful
democracy.” [4]


This argument of Kautsky’s, which is repeated in every key by
    his Russian armour-bearer (and Russian shielder of the
    social-chauvinists),
Mr. Spectator, constitutes the basis of
    Kautskian critique of imperialism, and that is why we must deal
    with it in greater detail. We will begin with a quotation from
    Hilferding, whose conclusions Kautsky on many occasions, and
    notably in April 1915, has declared to have been “unanimously
    adopted by all socialist theoreticians.”


“It is not the business of the proletariat,” writes Hilferding
    “to contrast the more progressive capitalist policy with that of
    the now bygone era of free trade and of hostility towards the
    state. The reply of the proletariat to the economic policy of
    finance capital, to imperialism, cannot be free trade, but
    socialism. The aim of proletarian policy cannot today be the ideal
    of restoring free competition—which has now become a
    reactionary ideal—but the complete elimination of
    competition by the abolition of
capitalism.” [5]


Kautsky broke with Marxism by advocating in the epoch of
    finance capital a “reactionary ideal,” “peaceful democracy,” “the
    mere operation of economic factors,” for objectively this
    ideal drags us back from monopoly to non-monopoly capitalism, and
    is a reformist swindle.


Trade with Egypt (or with any other colony or semi-colony)
    “would have grown more” without military occupation,
    without imperialism, and without finance capital. What does this
    mean? That capitalism would have developed more rapidly if free
    competition had not been restricted by monopolies in general, or
    by the “connections,” yoke (i.e., also the monopoly) of finance
    capital, or by the monopolist possession of colonies by certain
    countries?


Kautsky’s argument can have no other meaning; and


this “meaning” is meaningless. Let us assume that free
    competition, without any sort of monopoly, would have developed
    capitalism and trade more rapidly. But the more rapidly trade and
    capitalism develop, the greater is the concentration of production
    and capital which gives rise to monopoly. And monopolies
    have already arisen—precisely out of free
    competition! Even if monopolies have now begun to retard progress,
    it is not an argument in favour of free competition, which has
    become impossible after it has given rise to monopoly.


Whichever way one turns Kautsky’s argument, one will find
    nothing in it except reaction and bourgeois reformism.


Even if we correct this argument and say, as Spectator says,
    that the trade of the colonies with Britain is now developing more
    slowly than their trade with other countries, it does not save
    Kautsky; for it is also monopoly, also
    imperialism that is beating Great Britain, only it is the
    monopoly and imperialism of another country (America, Germany). It
    is known that the cartels have given rise to a new and peculiar
    form of protective tariffs, i.e., goods suitable for export are
    protected (Engels noted this in Vol. III of
Capital[12]). It
    is known, too, that the cartels add finance capital have a system
    peculiar to themselves, that of “exporting goods at cut-rate
    prices”, or “dumping,” as the English call it: within a given
    country the cartel sells its goods at high monopoly prices, but
    sells them abroad at a much lower price to undercut the
    competitor, to enlarge its own production to the utmost, etc. If
    Germany’s trade with the British colonies is developing more
    rapidly than Great Britain’s, it only proves that German
    imperialism is younger, stronger and better organised than British
    imperialism, is superior to it; but it by no means proves the
    “superiority” of free trade, for it is not a fight between free
    trade and protection and colonial dependence, but between two
    rival imperialisms, two monopolies, two groups of finance
    capital. The superiority of German imperialism over British
    imperialism is more potent than the wall of colonial frontiers or
    of protective tariffs: to use this as an “argument” in favour
    of free trade and “peaceful democracy” is banal, it means
    forgetting the essential features and characteristics

   

of
    imperialism, substituting petty-bourgeois reformism for
    Marxism.


It is interesting to note that even the bourgeois economist,
    A. Lansburgh, whose criticism of imperialism is as petty-bourgeois
    as Kautsky’s, nevertheless got closer to a more scientific study
    of trade statistics. He did not compare one single country, chosen
    at random, and one single colony with the other countries; he
    examined the export trade of an imperialist country: (1) with
    countries which are financially dependent upon it, and borrow
    money from it; and (2) with countries which are financially
    independent. He obtained the following results:

Lansburgh did not draw conclusions and therefore,
    strangely enough, failed to observe that if the figures prove
    anything at all, they prove that he is wrong, for the
    exports to countries financially dependent on Germany have grown
    more rapidly, if only slightly, than exports to the
    countries which are financially independent. (I emphasise the
    “if”, for Lansburgh’s figures are far from complete.)


Tracing the connection between exports and loans, Lansburgh
    writes:


“In 1890-91, a Rumanian loan was floated through the German
    banks, which had already in previous years made

   

advances on this
loan. It was used chiefly to purchase railway materials in
Germany. In 1891, German exports to Rumania amounted to 55 million
    marks. The following year they dropped to 39.4 million marks and,
    with fluctuations, to 25.4 million in 1900. Only in very recent
    years have they regained the level of 1891, thanks to two new
    loans.


“German exports to Portugal rose, following the loans of 1888-
    to 21,100,000 (1890); then, in the two following years, they
    dropped to 16,200,000 and 7,400,000, and regained their former
    level only in 1903.


“The figures of German trade with Argentina are still more
    striking. Loans were floated in 1888 and 1890; German exports to
    Argentina reached 60,700,000 marks (1889). Two years later they
    amounted to only 18,600,000 marks, less than one-third of the
    previous figure. It was not until 1901 that they regained and
    surpassed the level of 1889, and then only as a result of new
    loans floated by the state and by municipalities, with advances to
    build power stations, and with other credit operations.


“Exports to Chile, as a consequence of the loan of 1889, rose
    to 45,200,000 marks (in 1892), and a year later dropped to
    22,500,000 marks. A new Chilean loan floated by the German banks
    in 1906 was followed by a rise of exports to 84,700,000 marks in
    1907, only to fall again to 52,400,000 marks in
1908.” [6]


From these facts Lansburgh draws the amusing petty-bourgeois
    moral of how unstable and irregular export trade is when it is
    bound up with loans, how bad it is to invest capital abroad
    instead of “naturally” and “harmoniously” developing home
    industry, how “costly” are the millions in bakshish that Krupp has
    to pay in floating foreign loans, etc. But the facts tell us
    clearly: the increase in exports is connected with just these
    swindling tricks of finance capital, which is not concerned
    with bourgeois morality, but with skinning the ox twice—first, it pockets the profits from the loan; then it pockets other
    profits from the same loan which the borrower uses to
    make purchases from Krupp, or to purchase railway material from
    the Steel Syndicate, etc.



I repeat that I do not by any means consider Lansburgh’s
    figures to be perfect; but I had to quote them because they are
    more scientific than Kautsky’s and Spectator’s and because
    Lansburgh showed the correct way to approach the question. In
    discussing the significance of finance capital in regard to
    exports, etc., one must be able to single out the connection of
    exports especially and solely with the tricks of the financiers,
    especially and solely with the sale of goods by cartels,
    etc. Simply to compare colonies with non-colonies, one imperialism
    with another imperialism, one semi-colony or colony (Egypt) with
    all other countries, is to evade and to obscure the very
    essence of the question.


Kautsky’s theoretical critique of imperialism has nothing in
    common with Marxism and serves only as a preamble to propaganda
    for peace and unity with the opportunists and the
    social-chauvinists, precisely for the reason that it evades and
    obscures the very profound and fundamental contradictions of
    imperialism: the contradictions between monopoly and free
    competition which exists side by side with it, between the
    gigantic “operations” (and gigantic profits) of finance capital
    and “honest” trade in the free market, the contradiction between
    cartels and trusts, on the one hand, and non-cartelised industry,
    on the other, etc.


The notorious theory of “ultra-imperialism,” invented by
    Kautsky, is just as reactionary. Compare his arguments on this
    subject in 1915, with Hobson’s arguments in 1902.


Kautsky: “... Cannot the present imperialist policy be
    supplanted by a new, ultra-imperialist policy, which will
    introduce the joint exploitation of the world by internationally
    united finance capital in place of the mutual rivalries of
    national finance capitals? Such a new phase of capitalism is at
    any rate conceivable. Can it be achieved? Sufficient premises are
    still lacking to enable us to answer this
question.” [7]


Hobson: “Christendom thus laid out in a few great federal
    empires, each with a retinue of uncivilised dependencies, seems to
    many the most legitimate development of present

   

tendencies, and
    one which would offer the best hope of permanent peace on an
    assured basis of inter-imperialism.”


Kautsky called ultra-imperialism or super-imperialism what
    Hobson, thirteen years earlier, described as inter-
    imperialism. Except for coining a new and clever catchword,
    replacing one Latin prefix by another, the only progress Kautsky
    has made in the sphere of “scientific” thought is that he gave out
    as Marxism what Hobson, in effect, described as the cant of
    English parsons.

    After the Anglo-Boer War it was quite natural for this highly
    honourable caste to exert their main efforts to console
    the British middle class and the workers who had lost many of
    their relatives on the battlefields of South Africa and who were
    obliged to pay higher taxes in order to guarantee still higher
    profits for the British financiers. And what better consolation
    could there be than the theory that imperialism is not so bad;
    that it stands close to inter- (or ultra-) imperialism, which can
    ensure permanent peace? No matter what the good intentions of the
    English parsons, or of sentimental Kautsky, may have been, the
    only objective, i.e., real, social significance of Kautsky’s
    “theory” is this: it is a most reactionary method of consoling the
    masses with hopes of permanent peace being possible under
    capitalism, by distracting their attention from the sharp
    antagonisms and acute problems of the present times, and directing
    it towards illusory prospects of an imaginary “ultraimperialism”
    of the future. Deception of the masses—that is all there is
    in Kautsky’s “Marxist” theory.


Indeed, it is enough to compare well-known and indisputable
    facts to become convinced of the utter falsity of the prospects
    which Kautsky tries to conjure up before the German workers (and
    the workers of all lands). Let us consider India, Indo-China and
    China. It is known that these three colonial and semi-colonial
    countries, with a population of six to seven hundred million, are
    subjected to the exploitation of the finance capital of several
    imperialist powers: Great Britain, France, Japan, the U.S.A.,
    etc. Let us assume that these imperialist countries form alliances
    against one another in order to protect or enlarge their
    possessions, their interests and their spheres of influence in
    these Asiatic states; these alliances will be “inter-imperialist”,
    or “ultra-imperialist”

   

alliances. Let us assume that all the imperialist countries
conclude an alliance for the
    “peaceful” division of these parts of Asia; this alliance would be
    an alliance of “internationally united finance capital.” There are
    actual examples of alliances of this kind in the history of the
    twentieth century—the attitude of the powers to China, for
    instance. We ask, is it “conceivable,” assuming that the
    capitalist system remains intact—and this is precisely the
    assumption that Kautsky does make—that such alliances would
    be more than temporary, that they would eliminate friction,
    conflicts and struggle in every possible form?


The question has only to be presented clearly for any other
    than a negative answer to be impossible. This is because the only
    conceivable basis under capitalism for the division of spheres of
    influence, interests, colonies, etc., is a calculation of the
    strength of those participating, their general economic,
    financial, military strength, etc. And the strength of these
    participants in the division does not change to an equal degree,
    for the even development of different undertakings,
    trusts, branches  of industry, or countries is impossible under
    capitalism. Half a century ago Germany was a miserable,
    insignificant country, if her capitalist strength is compared with
    that of the Britain of that time; Japan compared with Russia in
    the same way. Is it “conceivable” that in ten or twenty years’
    time the relative strength of the imperialist powers will have
    remained unchanged? It is out of the question.


Therefore, in the realities of the capitalist system, and not
    in the banal philistine fantasies of English parsons, or of the
    German “Marxist,” Kautsky, “inter-imperialist” or “ultra-imperialist”
    alliances, no matter what form they may assume,
    whether of one imperialist coalition against another, or of a
    general alliance embracing all the imperialist powers,
    are inevitably nothing more than a “truce” in periods
    between wars. Peaceful alliances prepare the ground for wars, and
    in their turn grow out of wars; the one conditions the other,
    producing alternating forms of peaceful and non-peaceful struggle
    on one and the same basis of imperialist connections and
    relations within world economics and world politics. But in order
    to pacify the workers and reconcile them with the social-chauvinists
    who have

   

deserted to the side of the bourgeoisie,
    over-wise Kautsky separates one link of a single chain
    from another, separates the present peaceful (and
    ultra-imperialist, nay, ultra-ultra-imperialist) alliance of
    all the powers for the “pacification” of China (remember
    the suppression of the Boxer
Rebellion) from the non-peaceful conflict of
tomorrow, which will prepare the ground for another “peaceful”
general alliance for the partition, say, of Turkey, on the day
after tomorrow, etc., etc. Instead of showing the
living connection between periods of imperialist peace and
periods of imperialist war, Kautsky presents the workers with
a lifeless abstraction in order to reconcile them to their
lifeless leaders.


An American writer, Hill, in his A History of the Diplomacy
    in the International Development of Europe refers in his
    preface to the following periods in the recent history of
    diplomacy: (1) the era of revolution; (2) the constitutional
    movement; (3) the present era of “commercial
imperialism.” [8]

Another
    writer divides the history of Great Britain’s “world policy” since
    1870 into four periods: (1) the first Asiatic period (that of the
    struggle against Russia’s advance in Central Asia towards India);
    (2) the African period (approximately 1885-1902): that of the
    struggle against France for the partition of Africa (the “Fashoda
    incident” of 1898 which brought her within a hair’s breadth of war
    with France); (3) the second Asiatic period (alliance with Japan
    against Russia); and (4) the “European” period, chiefly
    anti-German. [9]

“The political patrol clashes take
    place on the financial field,” wrote the banker, Riesser, in 1905,
    in showing how French finance capital operating in Italy was
    preparing the way for a political alliance of these countries, and
    how a conflict was developing between Germany and Great Britain
    over Persia, between all the European capitalists over Chinese
    loans, etc. Behold, the living reality of peaceful
    “ultra-imperialist” alliances in their inseverable connection with
    ordinary imperialist conflicts!


Kautsky’s obscuring of the deepest contradictions of

   

    imperialism, which inevitably boils down to painting imperialism
    in bright colours, leaves its traces in this writer’s criticism of
    the political features of imperialism. Imperialism is the epoch of
    finance capital and of monopolies, which introduce everywhere the
    striving for domination, not for freedom. Whatever the political
    system, the result of these tendencies is everywhere reaction and
    an extreme intensification of antagonisms in this
    field. Particularly intensified become the yoke of national
    oppression and the striving for annexations, i.e., the violation
    of national independence (for annexation is nothing but the
    violation of the right of nations to
    self-determination). Hilferding rightly notes the connection
    between imperialism and the intensification of national
    oppression. “In the newly opened-up countries,” he writes, “the
    capital imported into them intensifies antagonisms and excites
    against the intruders the constantly growing resistance of the
    peoples who are awakening to national consciousness; this
    resistance can easily develop into dangerous measures against
    foreign capital. The old social relations become completely
    revolutionised, the age-long agrarian isolation of ‘nations
    without history’ is destroyed and they are drawn into the
    capitalist whirlpool. Capitalism itself gradually provides the
    subjugated with the means and resources for their emancipation and
    they set out to achieve the goal which once seemed highest to the
    European nations: the creation of a united national state as a
    means to economic and cultural freedom. This movement for national
    independence threatens European capital in its most valuable and
    most promising fields of exploitation, and European capital can
    maintain its domination only by continually increasing its
    military
forces.” [10]


To this must be added that it is not only in newly opened-up
    countries, but also in the old, that imperialism is leading to
    annexation, to increased national oppression, and, consequently,
    also to increasing resistance. While objecting

   

to the
    intensification of political reaction by imperialism, Kautsky
    leaves in the shade a question that has become particularly
    urgent, viz., the impossibility of unity with the opportunists in
    the epoch of imperialism. While objecting to annexations, he
    presents his objections in a form that is most acceptable and
    least offensive to the opportunists. He addresses himself to a
    German audience, yet he obscures the most topical and important
    point, for instance, the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by
    Germany. In order to appraise this “mental aberration” of
    Kautsky’s I shall take the following example. Let us suppose that
    a Japanese condemns the annexation of the Philippines by the
    Americans. The question is: will many believe that he does so
    because he has a horror of annexations as such, and not because he
    himself has a desire to annex the Philippines? And shall we not be
    constrained to admit that the “fight” the Japanese is waging
    against annexations can be regarded as being sincere and
    politically honest only if he fights against the annexation of
    Korea by Japan, and urges freedom for Korea to secede from
    Japan?


Kautsky’s theoretical analysis of imperialism, as well as his
    economic and political critique of imperialism, are permeated
    through and through with a spirit, absolutely
    irreconcilable with Marxism, of obscuring and glossing over the
    fundamental contradictions of imperialism and with a striving to
    preserve at all costs the crumbling unity with opportunism in the
    European working-class movement.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
A POPULAR OUTLINE



X. THE PLACE OF IMPERIALISM IN HISTORY

We have seen that in its economic essence imperialism is
      monopoly capitalism.  This in itself determines its place in
      history, for monopoly that grows out of the soil of free
      competition, and precisely out of free competition, is the
      transition from the capitalist system to a higher socio-economic
      order.  We must take special note of the four principal types of
      monopoly, or principal manifestations of monopoly capitalism,
      which are characteristic of the epoch we are examining.


Firstly, monopoly arose out of the concentration of production
      at a very high stage.  This refers to the monopolist capitalist
      associations, cartels, syndicatess, and trusts.  We have seen
      the important part these play in present-day economic life.  At
      the beginning of the twentieth century,

   

monopolies had acquired
      complete supremacy in the advanced countries, and although the
      first steps towards the formation of the cartels were taken by
      countries enjoying the protection of high tariffs (Germany,
      America), Great Britain, with her system of free trade, revealed
      the same basic phenomenon, only a little later, namely, the
      birth of monopoly out of the concentration of production.


Secondly, monopolies have stimulated the seizure of the most
      important sources of raw materials, especially for the basic and
      most highly cartelised industries in capitalist society: the
      coal and iron industries. The monopoly of the most important
      sources of raw materials has enormously increased the power of
      big capital, and has sharpened the antagonism between cartelised
      and non-cartelised industry.


Thirdly, monopoly has sprung from the banks. The banks have
      developed from modest middleman enterprises into the monopolists
      of finance capital. Some three to five of the biggest banks in
      each of the foremost capitalist countries have achieved the
      “personal link-up” between industrial and bank capital, and have
      concentrated in their hands the control of thousands upon
      thousands of millions which form the greater part of the capital
      and income of entire countries. A financial oligarchy, which
      throws a close network of dependence relationships over all the
      economic and political institutions of present-day bourgeois
      society without exception—such is the most striking
      manifestation of this monopoly.


Fourthly, monopoly has grown out of colonial policy. To the
      numerous “old” motives of colonial policy, finance capital has
      added the struggle for the sources of raw materials, for the
      export of capital, for spheres of influence, i.e., for spheres
      for profitable deals, concessions, monopoly profits and so on,
      economic territory in general. When the colonies of the European
      powers,for instance, comprised only one-tenth of the territory
      of Africa(as was the case in 1876), colonial policy was able to
      develop—by methods other than those of monopoly—by
      the “free grabbing” of territories, so to speak. But when
      nine-tenths of Africa had been seized (by 1900), when the whole
      world had been divided up,there was inevitably ushered in the
      era of monopoly possession of colonies and, consequently, of
      particularly

   

intense struggle for the division and the redivision
      of the world.


The extent to which monopolist capital has intensified all the
      contradictions of capitalism is generally known. It is
      sufficient to mention the high cost of living and the tyranny of
      the cartels. This intensification of contradictions constitutes
      the most powerful driving force of the transitional period of
      history, which began from the time of the final victory of world
      finance capital.


Monopolies, oligarchy, the striving for domination and not for
      freedom, the exploitation of an increasing number of small or
      weak nations by a handful of the richest or most powerful
      nations—all these have given birth to those distinctive
      characteristics of imperialism which compel us to define it as
      parasitic or decaying capitalism. More and more prominently
      there emerges, as one of the tendencies of imperialism, the
      creation of the “rentier state”, the usurer state, in which the
      bourgeoisie to an ever-increasing degree lives on the proceeds
      of capital exports and by “clipping coupons”. It would be a
      mistake to believe that this tendency to decay precludes the
      rapid growth of capitalism. It does not. In the epoch of
      imperialism, certain branches of industry, certain strata of the
      bourgeoisie and certain countries betray, to a greater or lesser
      degree, now one and now another of these tendencies. On the
      whole, capitalism is growing far more rapidly than before; but
      this growth is not only becoming more and more uneven in
      general, its unevenness also manifests itself, in particular, in
      the decay of the countries which are richest in capital
      (Britain).


In regard to the rapidity of Germany’s economic development,
      Riesser, the author of the book on the big German banks, states:
      “The progress of the preceding period (1848-70), which had not
      been exactly slow, compares with the rapidity with which the
      whole of Germany’s national economy, and with it German banking,
      progressed during this period (1870-1905) in about the same way
      as the speed of the mail coach in the good old days compares
      with the speed of the present-day automobile ... which is
      whizzing past so fast that it endangers not only innocent
      pedestrians in its path, but also the occupants of the car.” In
      its turn, this finance capital which has grown with such
      extraordinary

   

rapidity is not unwilling, precisely because it
      has grown so quickly, to pass on to a more “tranquil” possession
      of colonies which have to be seized—and not only by
      peaceful methods—from richer nations. In the United
      States, economic development in the last decades has been even
      more rapid than in Germany, and for this very reason,
      the parasitic features of modern American capitalism have stood
      out with particular prominence. On the other hand, a comparison
      of, say, the republican American bourgeoisie with the monarchist
      Japanese or German bourgeoisie shows that the most pronounced
      political distinction diminishes to an extreme degree in the
      epoch of imperialism—not because it is unimportant in
      general, but because in all these cases we are talking about a
      bourgeoisie which has definite features of parasitism.


The receipt of high monopoly profits by the capitalists in one
      of the numerous branches of industry, in one of the numerous
      countries, etc., makes it economically possible for them to
      bribe certain sections of the workers, and for a time a fairly
      considerable minority of them, and win them to the side of the
      bourgeoisie of a given industry or given nation against all the
      others. The intensification of antagonisms between imperialist
      nations for the division of the world increases this urge. And
      so there is created that bond between imperialism and
      opportunism, which revealed itself first and most clearly in
      Great Britain, owing to the fact that certain features of
      imperialist development were observable there much earlier than
      in other countries. Some writers, L. Martov, for example, are
      prone to wave aside the connection between imperialism and
      opportunism in the working-class movement—a particularly
      glaring fact at the present time—by resorting to
      “official optimism” (à la Kautsky and Huysmans)
      like the following: the cause of the opponents of capitalism
      would be hopeless if it were progressive capitalism that led to
      the increase of opportunism, or, if it were the best-paid
      workers who were inclined towards opportunism, etc. We must have
      no illusions about “optimism” of this kind. It is optimism in
      respect of opportunism; it is optimism which serves to conceal
      opportunism. As a matter of fact the extraordinary rapidity and
      the particularly revolting character of the development of

   

opportunism is by no means a guarantee that its victory will be
      durable: the rapid growth of a painful abscess on a healthy body
      can only cause it to burst more quickly and thus relieve the
      body of it. The most dangerous of all in this respect are those
      who do not wish to understand that the fight against imperialism
      is a sham and humbug unless it is inseparably bound up with the
      fight against opportunism.


From all that has been said in this book on the economic essence
      of imperialism, it follows that we must define it as capitalism
      in transition, or, more precisely, as moribund capitalism. It is
      very instructive in this respect to note that bourgeois
      economists, in describing modern capitalism, frequently employ
      catchwords and phrases like “interlocking”, “absence of
      isolation”, etc.; “in conformity with their functions and course
      of development”, banks are “not purely private business
      enterprises: they are more and more outgrowing the sphere of
      purely private business regulation”. And this very Riesser,
      whose words I have just quoted, declares with all seriousness
      that the “prophecy” of the Marxists concerning “socialisation”
      has “not come true”!


What then does this catchword “interlocking” express? It merely
      expresses the most striking feature of the process going on
      before our eyes. It shows that the observer counts the separate
      trees, but cannot see the wood. It slavishly copies the
      superficial, the fortuitous, the chaotic. It reveals the
      observer as one who is overwhelmed by the mass of raw material
      and is utterly incapable of appreciating its meaning and
      importance. Ownership of shares, the relations between owners of
      private property “interlock in a haphazard way”. But underlying
      this interlocking, its very base, are the changing social
      relations of production. When a big enterprise assumes gigantic
      proportions, and, on the basis of an exact computation of mass
      data, organises according to plan the supply of primary raw
      materials to the extent of two-thirds, or three-fourths, of all
      that is necessary for tens of millions of people; when the raw
      materials are transported in a systematic and organised manner
      to the most suitable places of production, sometimes situated
      hundreds or thousands of miles from each other;

   

when a single
      centre directs all the consecutive stages of processing the
      material right up to the manufacture of numerous varieties of
      finished articles; when these products are distributed according
      to a single plan among tens and hundreds of millions of
      consumers (the marketing of oil in America and Germany by the
      American oil trust)—then it becomes evident that we have
      socialisation of production, and not mere “interlocking”, that
      private economic and private property relations constitute a
      shell which no longer fits its contents, a shell which must
      inevitably decay if its removal is artificially delayed, a shell
      which may remain in a state of decay for a fairly long period
      (if, at the worst, the cure of the opportunist abscess is
      protracted), but which will inevitably be removed.


The enthusiastic admirer of German imperialism,
      Schulze-Gaevernitz, exclaims:


“Once the supreme management of the German banks has been
      entrusted to the hands of a dozen persons, their activity is
      even today more significant for the public good than that of the
      majority of the Ministers of State. .. . (The “interlocking” of
      bankers, ministers, magnates of industry and rentiers is here
      conveniently forgotten.) If we imagine the development of those
      tendencies we have noted carried to their logical conclusion we
      will have: the money capital of the nation united in the banks;
      the banks themselves combined into cartels; the investment
      capital of the nation cast in the shape of securities. Then the
      forecast of that genius Saint-Simon will be fulfilled:
‘The
      present anarchy of production, which corresponds to the fact
      that economic relations are developing without uniform
      regulation, must make way for organisation in
      production. Production will no longer be directed by isolated
      manufacturers, independent of each other and ignorant of man’s
      economic needs; that will be done by a certain public
      institution. A central committee of management, being able to
      survey the large field of social economy from a more elevated
      point of view, will regulate it for the benefit of the whole of
      society, will put the means of production into suitable hands,
      and above all will take care that there be constant harmony
      between production and consumption. Institutions already exist
      which have assumed as part of their functions a certain

   

organisation of economic labour, the banks.’  We are still a
      long way from the fulfilment of Saint-Simon’s forecast, but we
      are on the way towards it: Marxism, different from what Marx
      imagined, but different only in
form.” [1]


A crushing “refutation” of Marx indeed, which retreats a step
      from Marx’s precise, scientific analysis to Saint-Simon’s
      guess-work, the guess-work of a genius, but guess-work all the
      same.

At last there has appeared in Germany, illegally, without any
adaptation to the despicable Junker censorship, a
Social-Democratic pamphlet dealing with questions of the war!
The author, who evidently belongs to the “Left-radical” wing of
the Party, signs himself
Junius[3] (which in
Latin means junior) and gave his pamphlet the title: The
Crisis of Social-Democracy. Appended are the
“Theses on the Tasks of International Social-Democracy,” which
have already been submitted to the Berne I.S.C. (International
Socialist Committee) and published in No. 3 of its
Bulletin; the theses were drafted by the
“International” group, which in the spring of 1915 published one
issue of a magazine under that title (with articles by Zetkin,
Mehring, R. Luxemburg, Thalheimer, Duncker, Ströbel and others),
and which in the winter of 1915-16 convened a conference of
Social-Democrats from all parts of
Germany[4]
at which these theses were adopted.


The pamphlet, the author says in the introduction dated January
2, 1916, was written in April, 1915, and published “without any
alteration”. “Outside circumstances” prevented it from being
published earlier. The pamphlet is devoted not so much to the
“crisis of Social-Democracy” as to an analysis of the war, to
refuting the legend of its being a war for national liberation,
to proving that it is an imperialist war on the part of Germany
as well as on the part of the other Great Powers, and to a
revolutionary criticism of the behaviour of the official
party. Written in a very lively style, Junius’ pamphlet has
undoubtedly played and will play an important role in the
struggle against the ex-Social-Democratic Party of Germany,
which has deserted to the side of the bourgeoisie and the
Junkers, and we heartily greet the author.

 

To the Russian reader who is familiar with the Social-Democratic
Literature published abroad in Russian in 1914-16, Junius’
pamphlet offers nothing new in principle. But in reading this
pamphlet and comparing the arguments of this German
revolutionary Marxist with what has been stated, for example, in
the manifesto of the Central Committee of our Party
(September-November, 1914)



in the Berne resolutions (March, 1915)



and in the numerous
commentaries on them, it becomes dear that Junius’ arguments are
very incomplete and that he commits two errors. Proceeding to
criticise Junius’ faults and errors we must strongly emphasise
that we do so for the sake of self criticism, which is so
necessary for Marxists, and of submitting to an all-round test
the views which must serve as the ideological basis of the Third
International. On the whole, Junius’ pamphlet is a splendid



Marxian work, and in all probability its defects are, to a
certain extent, accidental.


The chief defect in Junius’ pamphlet, and what marks a definite
step backward compared with the legal (although immediately
suppressed) magazine, international, is its silence
regarding the connection between social-chauvinism (the author
uses neither this nor the less precise term social-patriotism)
and opportunism. The author rightly speaks of the “capitulation”
and collapse of the German Social-Democratic Party and of the
“treachery” of its “official leaders,” but he goes no further
than this. The International, however, did criticise
the “Centre,” i.e., Kautskyism, and quite properly
poured ridicule on it for its spinelessness, its prostitution of
Marxism and its servility to the opportunists. This magazine
also began to expose the role the opportunists are
really playing by making known, for example, the very important
fact that on August 4, 1914, the opportunists came forth with an
ultimatum, with their minds made up to vote for the war
credits under any circumstances. Neither in Junius’ pamphlet nor
in the theses is anything said about opportunism or about
Kautskyism! This is wrong from the standpoint of theory, for it

    

is impossible to explain the “betrayal” without linking
it up with opportunism as a trend with a long history,
the history of the whole Second International. It is a mistake
from the practical-political standpoint, for it is impossible to
understand the “crisis of Social-Democracy” or overcome it
without making clear the meaning and the role of
two trends: the avowedly
opportunist trend (Legien, David etc.) and the masked
opportunist trend (Kautsky and Co.). This is a step backward
compared with the historic article by Otto Ruhle in
Vorwärts of January 13, 1916, in which he directly and
openly pointed out that a split in the Social-Democratic Party
of Germany was inevitable (the editors of the
Vorwärts answered him by repeating honeyed and
hypocritical Kautskyist phrases, for they were unable to advance
a single material argument to disprove the assertion that there
were already two parties in existence, and that these
two parties could not be reconciled). It is astonishingly
inconsistent, because the international thesis No. 12
directly states that it is necessary to create a “new”
International, owing to the “treachery” of the “official
representatives of the Socialist Parties of the leading
countries” and their “adoption of the principles of bourgeois
imperialist politics.” Clearly, to suggest that the old
Social-Democratic Party of Germany, or parties which
tolerate Legien, David and Co, would participate in a “new”
International is simply ridiculous.


We do not know why the international group took this
step backward. A very great defect in revolutionary Marxism in
Germany as a whole is its lack of a compact illegal organisation
that would systematically pursue its line and educate the masses
in the spirit of the new tasks; such an organisation would also
have to take a definite stand towards opportunism and
Kautskyism. This is all the more necessary now, since the German
revolutionary Social-Democrats have been deprived of their last
two daily papers: the one in Bremen (Bremen
=
Burger-zeitung),[5] and the one in Brunswick
(Volksfreund),[6] both of which have
gone over to the Kautskyists. That the “International Socialists
of Germany” (I.S.D.) group alone remains at its post is
definitely clear to everybody.


Some members of the international group have evidently
slipped once again into the morass of unprincipled

    

Kautskyism. Ströbel, for instance, went so far as to
make obeisance, in the Neue Zeit, to Bernstein and
Kautsky! And only the other day, on August 15, 1916, he had an
article in the papers entitled “Pacifism and Social-Democracy,”
in which he defends the most vulgar type of Kautskyian
pacifism. Junius, however, strongly opposes Kautsky’s fantastic
schemes for “disarmament,” “abolition of secret diplomacy”
etc. Perhaps there are two trends in the international
group: a revolutionary trend and a trend wavering in the
direction of Kautskyism.



The first of Junius’ erroneous postulates, the first is
contained in the International group’s thesis No. 5:
“In the epoch (era) of this unbridled imperialism, there can be
no more national wars. National interests serve only as an
instrument of deception, to deliver the masses of the toiling
people into the service of their mortal enemy, imperialism....”
This postulate is the end of thesis No. 5, the first part of
which is devoted to the description of the present war
as an imperialist war. The repudiation of national wars in
general may either be an oversight or a fortuitous over-emphasis
of the perfectly correct idea that the present war is
an imperialist war and not a national war. But as the opposite
may be true, as various Social-Democrats mistakenly
repudiate all national wars because the
present war is falsely represented to be a national
war, we are obliged to deal with this mistake.


Junius is



quite
right in emphasising the decisive influence of the “imperialist
background” of the present war, when he says that
behind Serbia there is Russia, “behind Serbian nationalism there
is Russian imperialism”; that even if a country like Holland
took part in the present war, she too would be waging an
imperialist war, because, firstly, Holland would be defending
her colonies, and, secondly, she would be an ally of one of the
imperialist coalitions. This is indisputable in
relation to the present war. And when Junius lays
particular emphasis on what to him is the most important point:
the struggle against the “phantom of national war, which at
present dominates Social-Democratic policy” (p. 81, Junius’
pamphlet), we cannot but agree that his reasoning is correct and
quite appropriate.


But it would be a mistake to exaggerate this truth; to depart
from the Marxian rule to be concrete;

    

to apply the appraisal of
the present war to all wars that are possible under imperialism;
to lose sight of the national movements against
imperialism. The only argument that can be used in defence of
the thesis: “there can be no more national wars” is that the
world has been divided up among a handful of “Great” imperialist
powers, and, therefore, every war, even if it starts as a
national war, is transformed into an imperialist war
and affects the interests of one of the imperialist Powers or
coalitions (p. 81 of Junius’ pamphlet).


The fallacy of this argument is obvious. Of course, the
fundamental proposition of Marxian dialectics is that all
boundaries in nature and society are conventional and mobile,
that there is not a single phenomenon which cannot
under certain conditions be transformed into its opposite. A
national war can be transformed into an imperialist war, and
vice versa. For example, the wars of the Great French
Revolution started as national wars and were such. They were
revolutionary wars because they were waged in defence of the
Great Revolution against a coalition of counter-revolutionary
monarchies. But after Napoleon had created the French Empire by
subjugating a number of large, virile, long established national
states of Europe, the French national wars became imperialist
wars, which in their turn engendered wars for national
liberation against Napoleon’s imperialism.


Only a sophist would deny that there is a difference between
imperialist war and national war on the grounds that one
can be transformed into the other. More than once, even
in the history of Greek philosophy, dialectics have served as a
bridge to sophistry. We, however, remain dialecticians and
combat sophistry, not by a sweeping denial of the possibility of
transformation in general, but by concretely analysing a
given phenomenon in the circumstances that surround it
and in its development.


It is highly improbable that this imperialist war of 1914–16
will be transformed into a national war, because the class that
represents progress is the proletariat, which,
objectively, is striving to transform this war into civil war
against the bourgeoisie; and also because the strength of both
coalitions is almost equally balanced, while international
finance capital has everywhere created a reactionary
bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that such a
transformation is

    

impossible: if the European
proletariat were to remain impotent for another twenty years;
if the present war were to end in victories similar to
those achieved by Napoleon, in the subjugation of a number of
virile national states; if imperialism outside of
Europe (primarily American and Japanese) were to remain in power
for another twenty years without a transition to socialism, say,
as a result of a Japanese-American war, then a great national
war in Europe would be possible. This means that Europe would be
thrown back for several decades. This is
improbable. But it is not impossible, for to picture
world history as advancing smoothly and steadily without
sometimes taking gigantic strides backward is undialectical,
unscientific and theoretically wrong.


Further, national wars waged by colonial, and semi-colonial
countries are not only possible but inevitable in the
epoch of imperialism. The colonies and semi-colonies (China,
Turkey, Persia) have a population of nearly one billion,
i.e., more than half the population of the earth. In
these countries the movements for national liberation are either
very strong already or are growing and maturing. Every war is a
continuation of politics by other means. The national liberation
politics of the colonies will inevitably be continued
by national wars of the colonies against
imperialism. Such wars may lead to an imperialist war
between the present “Great” imperialist Powers or they may not;
that depends on many circumstances.


For example: England and France were engaged in a seven years
war for colonies, i.e., they waged an imperialist war (which is
as possible on the basis of slavery, or of primitive capitalism,
as on the basis of highly developed modern capitalism). France
was defeated and lost part of her colonies. Several years later
the North American States started a war for national liberation
against England alone. Out of enmity towards England, i.e., in
conformity with their own imperialist interests, France and
Spain, which still held parts of what are now the United States,
concluded friendly treaties with the states that had risen
against England. The French forces together with the American
defeated the English. Here we have a war for national liberation
in which imperialist rivalry is a contributory element of no
great importance, which is the opposite of what we have in the

    

war of 1914–16 (in which the national element in the
Austro-Serbian war is of no great importance compared with the
all determining imperialist rivalry). This shows how absurd it
would be to employ the term imperialism in a stereotyped fashion
by deducing from it that national wars are “impossible.” A war
for national liberation waged, for example, by an alliance of
Persia, India and China against certain imperialist Powers is
quite possible and probable, for it follows logically from the
national liberation movements now going on in those
countries. Whether such a war will be transformed into an
imperialist war among the present imperialist Powers will depend
on a great many concrete circumstances, and it would be
ridiculous to guarantee that these circumstances will arise.


Thirdly, national wars must not be regarded as impossible in the
epoch of imperialism even in Europe. The “epoch of imperialism”
made the present war an imperialist war; it inevitably engenders
(until the advent of socialism) new imperialist war; it
transformed the policies of the present Great Powers into
thoroughly imperialist policies. But this “epoch” by no means
precludes the possibility of national wars, waged, for example,
by small (let us assume, annexed or nationally oppressed) states
against the imperialist Powers, any more than it
precludes the possibility of big national movements in Eastern
Europe. With regard to Austria, for example, Junius shows sound
judgment in taking into account not only the “economic,” but
also the peculiar political situation, in noting Austria’s
“inherent lack of vitality” and admitting that “the Hapsburg
monarchy is not a political organisation of a bourgeois state,
but only a loosely knit syndicate of several cliques of social
parasites,” that “historically, the liquidation of
Austria-Hungary is merely the continuation of the disintegration
of Turkey and at the same time a demand of the historical
process of development.” The situation is no better in certain
Balkan states and in Russia. And in the event of the “Great
Powers” becoming extremely exhausted in the present war, or in
the event of a victorious revolution in Russia, national wars,
even victorious ones, are quite possible. On the one hand,
intervention by the imperialist powers is not possible
under all circumstances. On the other hand, when people argue
haphazardly that a war waged by a small state against a giant
state is hopeless, we must say that a hopeless

    

war is war
nevertheless, and, moreover, certain events within the “giant”
states—for example, the beginning of a revolution—may
transform a “hopeless” war into a very “hopeful” one.


The fact that the postulate that “there can be no more national
wars” is obviously fallacious in theory is not the only reason
why we have dealt with this fallacy at length. It would be a
very deplorable thing, of course, if the “Lefts” began to be
careless in their treatment of Marxian theory, considering that
the Third International can be established only on the basis of
Marxism, unvulgarised Marxism. But this fallacy is also very
harmful in a practical political sense; it gives rise to the
stupid propaganda for “disarmament,” as if no other war but
reactionary wars are possible; it is the cause of the still more
stupid and downright reactionary indifference towards national
movements. Such indifference becomes chauvinism when members of
“Great” European nations, i.e., nations which oppress a mass of
small and colonial peoples, declare with a learned air that
“there can be no more national wars!” National wars
against the imperialist Powers are not only
possible and probable, they are inevitable, they are
progressive and revolutionary, although, of
course, what is needed for their success is either the combined
efforts of an enormous number of the inhabitants of the
oppressed countries (hundreds of millions in the example we have
taken of India and China), or a particularly favourable
combination of circumstances in the international situation (for
example, when the intervention of the imperialist Powers is
paralysed by exhaustion, by war, by their mutual  antagonisms,
etc.), or a simultaneous uprising of the proletariat of
one of the Great Powers against the bourgeoisie (this latter
case stands first in order from the standpoint of what is
desirable and advantageous for the victory of the proletariat).


We must state, however, that it would be unfair to accuse Junius
of being indifferent to national movements. When enumerating the
sins of the Social-Democratic Parliamentary group, he does at
least mention their silence in the matter of the execution of a
native leader in the Cameroons for “treason” (evidently for an
attempt at insurrection in connection with the war); and in
another place he emphasises (for the special benefit of
Messrs. Legien, Lensch and similar scoundrels

    

who call
themselves “Social-Democrats”) that colonial nations are also
nations. He declares very definitely:

“Socialism recognises for every people the right to independence
and freedom, the right to be masters of their own
destiny.... International socialism recognises the right of
free, independent, equal nations, but only socialism can create
such nations, only socialism can establish the right of nations
to self-determination. This slogan of socialism,” justly
observes the author, “like all its other slogans, serves, not to
justify the existing order of things, but as a guide post, as a
stimulus to the revolutionary, reconstructive, active policy of
the proletariat.” (p. 77-78)

Consequently, it would be a profound mistake to suppose that all
the Left German Social-Democrats have stooped to the
narrow-mindedness and distortion of Marxism advocated by certain
Dutch and Polish Social-Democrats, who repudiate
self-determination of nations even under socialism. However, we
shall deal with the special Dutch and Polish sources of
this mistake elsewhere.


Another fallacious argument advanced by Junius is in
connection with the question of defence of the
fatherland. This is a cardinal political question during an
imperialist war. Junius has strengthened us in our conviction
that our Party has indicated the only correct approach to this
question: the proletariat is opposed to defence of the
fatherland in this imperialist war because of its
predatory, slave-owning, reactionary character, because
it is possible and necessary to oppose to it (and to strive to
convert it into) civil war for socialism. Junius, however, while
brilliantly exposing the imperialist character of the present
war as distinct from a national war, falls into the very strange
error of trying to drag a national programme into the
present non-national war. It sounds almost incredible,
but it is true.


The official Social-Democrats, both of the Legien and of the
Kautsky shade, in their servility to the bourgeoisie, who have
been making the most noise about foreign “invasion” in order to
deceive the masses of the people as to the imperialist character
of the war, have been particularly assiduous in repeating this
“invasion” argument. Kautsky, who now assures naive and
credulous people (incidentally,

    

through the mouth of
“Spectator,” a member of the Russian Organization Committee)
that he joined the opposition at the end of 1914, continues to
use this “argument”! To refute it, Junius quotes extremely
instructive examples from history, which prove that “invasion
and class struggle are not contradictory in bourgeois history,
as the official legend has it, but that one is the means and the
expression of the other.” For example, the Bourbons in France
invoked foreign invaders against the Jacobins; the bourgeoisie
in 1871 invoked foreign invaders against the Commune.

In his
Civil
War in France, Marx wrote:


“The highest heroic effort of which old society is still capable
is national war; and this is now proved to be a mere
governmental humbug, intended to defer the struggle of the
classes, and to be thrown aside as soon as that class struggle
bursts out in civil
war.”[7]


“The classical example for all times,” says Junius, referring to
1793, “is the Great French Revolution.” From all this, he draws
the following conclusion:

“Century-old experience thus proves that it is not a state of
siege, but heroic class struggle, which rouses the self-respect,
the heroism and the moral strength of the masses of the people,
and serves as the country’s best protection and defence against
the foreign enemy.”


Junius’ practical conclusion is this:



“Yes, it is the duty of the Social-Democrats to defend their
country during a great historical crisis. But the grave guilt
that rests upon the Social-Democratic Reichstag group lies
precisely in that, in solemnly declaring, on August 4, 1914,
that ‘In the hour of danger we will not leave our fatherland
unprotected,’ they at the same time belied those words. They
did leave the fatherland unprotected in the hour of
greatest peril. For their first duty to the fatherland in that
hour was to show the fatherland what was really behind the
present imperialist war; to tear down the web of patriotic and
diplomatic lies with which this encroachment on the fatherland
was enmeshed; to proclaim loudly and dearly that both victory
and defeat in the present war are equally fatal for the German
people; to resist to the last the throttling of the fatherland
by declaring a state of siege; to proclaim the necessity of
immediately arming the people and of allowing the people to
decide the question

    

of war and peace; resolutely to demand a
permanent session of the people’s representatives for the whole
duration of the war in order to guarantee vigilant central over
the government by the people’s representatives, and the control
over the people’s representatives by the people; to demand the
immediate abolition of all restrictions on political rights, for
only a free people can successfully defend its country; and,
finally, to oppose the imperialist war programme, which is to
preserve Austria and Turkey, i.e., perpetuate reaction in Europe
and in Germany, with the old, truly national programme of the
patriots and democrats of 1848, the programme of Marx, Engels
and Lassalle: the slogan of a united, Great German
republic. This is the banner that should have been unfurled
before the country, which would have been a truly national
banner of liberation, which would have been in accord with the
best traditions of Germany and with the international class
policy of the proletariat....

Hence, the grave dilemma—the interests of the fatherland
or the international solidarity of the proletariat—the
tragic conflict which prompted our parliamentarians ‘with a
heavy heart’ to side with the imperialist war, is purely
imaginary, it is bourgeois nationalist fiction. On the contrary,
there is complete harmony between the interests of the country
and the class interests of the proletarian International, both
in time of war and in time of peace; both war and peace demand
the most energetic development of the class struggle, the most
determined fight for the Social-Democratic programme.”


This is how Junius argues. The fallacy of his argument is
strikingly evident, and since the masked and avowed lackeys of
tsarism, Messrs. Plekhanov and Chkhenkeli, and perhaps even
Messrs. Martov and Chkheidze may gloatingly seize upon Junius’
words, not for the purpose of establishing theoretical truth,
but for the purpose of wriggling, of covering up their tracks
and of throwing dust in the eyes of the workers, we must in
greater detail elucidate the theoretical source of
Junius’ error.


He proposes to “oppose” the imperialist war with a national
programme. He urges the advanced class to turn its face to the
past and not to the future! In France, in Germany, and in the
whole of Europe it was a bourgeois-democratic
    

revolution that, objectively, was on the order of the
day in 1793 and 1848. Corresponding to this objective
historical situation was the “truly national,” i.e.,
the national bourgeois programme of the then existing
democracy; in 1793 this programme was carried out by the most
revolutionary elements of the bourgeoisie and the plebeians, and
in 1848 it was proclaimed by Marx in the name of the whole of
progressive democracy. Objectively, the feudal and
dynastic wars were then opposed with revolutionary democratic
wars, with wars for national liberation. This was the content of
the historical tasks of that epoch.


At the present time the objective situation in
the biggest advanced states of Europe is different. Progress, if
we leave out the possibility of temporary steps backward, is
possible only towards socialist society, only towards
the socialist revolution. Objectively, the imperialist
bourgeois war, the war of highly developed capitalism, can, from
the standpoint of progress, from the standpoint of the
progressive class, be opposed only with a war against
the bourgeoisie, i.e., primarily civil war between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power; for unless
such a war is waged serious progress is impossible; and
after that—only under certain special conditions—a war
to defend the socialist state against bourgeois stares is
possible. That is why those Bolsheviks (fortunately, very few,
and we quickly handed them over to the
Prizyv-ists) who were ready to adapt the point
of view of conditional defence, i.e., of defending the
fatherland on the condition that there was a victorious
revolution and the victory of a republic in Russia, were true to
the letter of Bolshevism, but betrayed its
spirit: 48 for being drawn into the imperialist war of
the advanced European Powers, Russia, even under a republican
form of government, would also be waging an imperialist
war!


In saying that class struggle is the best means of defence
against invasion, Junius applied Marxian dialectics only
halfway, taking one step on the right road and immediately
deviating from it. Marxian dialectics call for a concrete
analysis of each specific historical situation. That class
struggle is the best means of defence against invasion is true
both with regard to the bourgeoisie, which is
overthrowing

    

feudalism, and with regard to the proletariat,
which is overthrowing the bourgeoisie. Precisely because it is
true with regard to every form of class oppression, it
is too general, and therefore, inadequate in
the present specific case. Civil war against the
bourgeoisie is also a form of class struggle, and only
this form of class struggle would have saved Europe (the whole
of Europe, not only one country) from the peril of invasion. The
“Great German Republic” had it existed in 1914-16, would
also have waged an imperialist war.


Junius came very close to the correct solution of the problem
and to the correct slogan: civil war against the bourgeoisie for
socialism; but, as if afraid to speak the whole truth, he turned
back to the fantasy of a “national war” in 1914, 1915
and 1916. Even if we examine the question from the purely
practical and not theoretical angle, Junius’ error remains no
less clear. The whole of bourgeois society, all classes in
Germany, including the peasantry, were in favour of war
(in all probability the same was the case in Russia—at
least a majority of the well-to-do and middle peasantry and a
very considerable portion of the poor peasants were evidently
under the spell of bourgeois imperialism). The bourgeoisie was
armed to the teeth. Under such circumstances to “proclaim” the
programme of a republic, a permanent parliament, election of
officers by the people (the “armed nation”), etc., would have
meant, in practice, “proclaiming” a revolution
(with a
wrong revolutionary programme!).


In the same breath Junius quite rightly says that a revolution
cannot be “made.” Revolution was on the order of the day in
1914–16, it was hidden in the depths of the war, was
emerging out of the war. This should have been
“proclaimed” in the name of the revolutionary class,
and its programme should have been fearlessly and fully
announced: socialism is impossible in time of war without civil
war against the arch-reactionary, criminal bourgeoisie, which
condemned the people to untold disaster. Systematic, consistent,
practical measures should have been thought out, which
could be carried out no matter what the
rate of development of the revolutionary crisis might
have been, and which would be in line with the maturing
revolution. These measures are indicated in the resolution of
our Party:
1) voting against war credits;
    

2) violation of “civil
peace”;
3) creation of an illegal organisation;
4)
fraternisation among the soldiers;
5) support to all the
revolutionary actions of the
masses.[1]

The success of
all these steps inevitably leads to civil war.


The promulgation of a great historical programme was undoubtedly
of tremendous significance; not the old national German
programme, which became obsolete in 1914-16, but the proletarian
international and socialist programme. “You, the bourgeoisie,
are fighting for plunder; we, the workers of all the belligerent
countries, declare war upon you for socialism”—this is the
sort of speech that should have been delivered in the
Parliaments on August 4, 1914, by Socialists who had not
betrayed the proletariat, as the Legiens, Davids, Kautskys,
Plekhanovs, Guesdes, Sembats, etc. betrayed it.


Evidently
Junius’ error is due to two mistakes in reasoning. There is no
doubt that Junius is decidedly opposed to the imperialist war
and is decidedly in favor of revolutionary tactics; and
all Messrs. Plehhanovs’ gloating over Junius’ “defencism” cannot
wipe out this fact. Possible and probable calumnies of
this kind must be answered promptly and bluntly.


But, firstly, Junius has not completely rid himself of the
“environment” of the German Social-Democrats, even the Lefts,
who are afraid of a split, who are afraid to follow
revolutionary slogans to their logical
conclusions.[2]
   

This is a
mistaken fear, and the Left Social-Democrats of Germany must and
will rid themselves of it. They will do so in
the course of the struggle against the social-chauvinists. The
fact is that they are fighting against their own
social-chauvinists resolutely, firmly and sincerely,
and this is the tremendous, the fundamental difference in
principle

    

between them and Messrs. Martovs and Chkheidzes, who,
with one hand (à la Skobelev) unfurl a banner
bearing the greeting, “To the Liebknechts of All Countries,” and
with the other hand tenderly embrace Chkhenkeli and Potresov!


Secondly, Junius apparently wanted to achieve something in the
nature of the Menshevik “theory of stages,” of sad memory; he
wanted to begin to carry out the revolutionary programme from
the end that is “more suitable,” “more popular” and more
acceptable to the petty-bourgeoisie. It is something
like the plan “to outwit history,” to outwit the philistines. He
seems to say: surely, nobody would oppose a better way
of defending the real fatherland; that real fatherland is the
Great German Republic, and the best defence is a militia, a
permanent parliament, etc. Once it was accepted, that programme
would automatically lead to the next stage-to the socialist
revolution.


Probably, it was reasoning of this kind that consciously or
semi-consciously determined Junius’ tactics. Needless to say,
such reasoning is fallacious, Junius’ pamphlet conjures up in
our mind the picture of a lone man who has no comrades
in an illegal organisation accustomed to thinking out
revolutionary slogans to their conclusion and systematically
educating the masses in their spirit. But this
shortcoming—it would be a grave error to forget this-is not
Junius’ personal failing, but the result of the weakness of all
the German Lefts, who have become entangled in the vile net of
Kautskyist hypocrisy, pedantry and  “friendliness” towards the
opportunists. Junius’ adherents have managed in spite
of their isolation to begin the publication of illegal
leaflets and to start the war against Kautskyism. They will
succeed in going further along the right road.


 
Notes

See present edition, Vol. 21, “The Conference of
the R.S.D.L.P. Groups Abroad.”—Ed.


[2]

We find the same error in Junius’ arguments about which is
better, victory or defeat His conclusion is that both
are equally bad (ruin, growth of armaments, etc.). This is the
point of view not of the revolutionary proletariat, but of the
pacifist petty bourgeois. If we speak about the “revolutionary
intervention” of the proletariat—of this both Junius and
the thews of the International group speak, although
unfortunately in too general terms—then we must
raise the question from another point of view, namely:
1) Is

   

“revolutionary intervention” possible without the risk of
defeat!
2) Is it possible to scourge the bourgeoisie and the
government of one’s own country without taking that
risk;
3) Have we not always asserted, and does not the
historical experience of reactionary wars prove, that defeats
help the cause of the revolutionary class?

Issue No. 2 of tile
 Herald (Vorbote No. 2, April1916), the Marxist journal of
 the Zimmerwald Left, published theses for and against the
 self-determination of nations, signed by the Editorial
 Board of our Central Organ,
 Sotsial-Demokrat,

 and by the Editorial Board of the organ of the Polish
 Social-Democratic opposition, Gazeta Robotnicza. Above
 the reader will find a reprint of the
former[1]

and a translation of the
 latter


theses.[15] This is practically the first
 time that the question has been presented so extensively in the
 international field: it was raised only in respect of Poland in
 the discussion carried on in the German Marxist journal
 Neue Zeit twenty years ago, 1895–96, before the
 London International Socialist Congress of 1896, by Rosa
 Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky and the Polish “independents” (champions
 of the independence of Poland, the Polish Socialist Party), who
 represented three different
views.[16] [see
 The Rights of Nations to
 Self-Determination] Since then, as far as we know, the
 question of self-determination has been discussed at all
 systematically only by the Dutch and the Poles. Let us hope that
 the Herald will succeed in promoting the discussion of
 this question, so urgent today, among the British, Americans,
 French, Germans and Italians. Official socialism, represented both
 by direct supporters of “their own” governments, the Plekhanovs,
 Davids and Co., and the undercover defenders of opportunism, the
 Kautskyites (among them Axelrod, Martov, Chkheidze and
 others), has told so many lies on this question that for a long
 time there will inevitably be efforts, on the one hand, to
 maintain

    

silence and evade the issue, and, on the other, workers’
 demands for “direct answers” to these “accursed questions”. We
 shall try to keep our readers informed of the struggle between the
 trends: among socialists abroad.


This question is of specific importance to us Russian
 Social-Democrats; the present discussion is a continuation of
 the one that took place in 1903 and
 1913[17];

 during
 the war this question has been the cause of some wavering in the
 thinking of Party members: it has been made more acute by the
 trickery of such prominent leaders of the Gvozdyov or chauvinist
 workers’ party as Martov and Chkheidze, in their efforts to
 evade the substance of the problem. It is essential, therefore,
 to sum up at least the initial results of the discussion that
 has been started in the international field.


It will he seen from the theses that our Polish comrades provide
 us with a direct answer to some of our arguments, for example,
 on Marxism and Proudhonism. In most cases, however, they do not
 answer us directly but indirectly, by opposing their
 assertions to ours. Let us examine both their direct and
 indirect answers.

1. Socialism and the Self-Determination of Nations

We have affirmed that it would be a betrayal of socialism
 to refuse to implement the self-determination of
 nations under socialism. We are told in reply that “the right of
 self-determination is not applicable to a socialist
 society”. The difference is a radical one. Where does it stem
 from?


“We know,” runs our opponents’ reasoning, “that
 socialism will abolish every kind of national oppression since
 it abolishes the class interests that lead to it....” What has
 this argument about the economic prerequisites for the
 abolition of national oppression, which are very well known and
 undisputed, to do with a discussion of one of the forms
 of political oppression, namely, the forcible retention
 of one nation within the state frontiers of another? This is
 nothing hut an attempt to evade political questions! And

    

subsequent arguments further convince us that our
 judgement is right: “We have no reason to believe that in a
 socialist society, the nation will exist as an economic and
 political unit. It will in all probability assume the character
 of a cultural and linguistic unit only, because the territorial
 division of a socialist cultural zone, if practised at all, can
 be made only according to the needs of production and,
 furthermore, the question of such a division will naturally not
 be decided by individual nations alone and in possession of full
 sovereignty [as is required by “the right to
 self-determination”], but will be determined jointly
 by all the citizens concerned....”


Our Polish comrades like this last argument, on joint
 determination instead of self-determination, so much
 that they repeat it three times in their theses!
 Frequency of repetition, however, does not turn this Octobrist
 and reactionary argument into a Social-Democratic argument. All
 reactionaries and bourgeois grant to nations forcibly retained
 within the frontiers of a given state the right to “determine
 jointly” their fate in a common parliament. Wilhelm II also
 gives the Belgians the right to “determine jointly” the fate of
 the German Empire in a common German parliament.


Our opponents try to evade precisely the point at issue. the
 only one that is up for discussion—the right to
 secede. This would be funny if it were not so tragic!


Our very first thesis said that the liberation of oppressed
 nations implies a dual transformation in the political
 sphere: (1) the full equality of nations. This is not disputed
 and applies only to what takes place within the state; (2)
 freedom of political separation.[2]

This refers to the
 demarcation of state frontiers. This only is
 disputed. But it is precisely this that our opponents remain
 silent about. They do not want to think either about state
 frontiers or even about the stabs as such. This is a sort of
 “imperialist Economism” like the old Economism of 1894–1902,
 which argued in this way: capitalism is victorious,
 therefore political questions are a waste of
 time. Imperialism is

    

victorious, therefore political
 questions are a waste of time! Such an apolitical
 theory is extremely harmful to Marxism.


In his Critique of the Gotha Programme, Marx wrote:
 “Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the
 revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. There
 corresponds to this also a political transition period in which
 the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of
 the
proletariat.”[18] Up to now this truth has been
 indisputable for socialists and it includes the recognition of
 the fact that the slate will exist until victorious
 socialism develops into full communism. Engels’s dictum about
 the withering away of the state is well known. We
 deliberately stressed, in the first thesis, that democracy is a
 form of state that will also wither away when the state withers
 away. And until our opponents replace Marxism by some sort of
 “non-state” viewpoint their arguments will constitute one big
 mistake.


Instead of speaking about the state (which means, about
 the demarcation of its frontiers!),
 they speak of a “socialist cultural zone”, i.e., they
 deliberately choose an expression that is indefinite in the
 sense that all state questions are obliterated! Thus we get a
 ridiculous tautology: if there is no state there can, of course,
 be no question of frontiers. In that case tile whole
 democratic-political programme is unnecessary. Nor will there be
 any republic, when the state “withers away”.


The German chauvinist Lensch, in the articles we mentioned in
 Thesis 5
(footnote),[3]

 quoted an interesting passage from
 Engels’s article “The Po and the Rhine”. Amongst other things,
 Engels says in this article that in the course of
 historical development, which swallowed up a number of small and
 non-viable nations, the “frontiers of great and viable European
 nations” were being increasingly determined by the “language and
 sympathies” of the population. Engels calls these frontiers
 “natural”.[19] Such was the case in the
 period of progressive capitalism in Europe, roughly from 1848 to
 1871. Today, these democratically determined

    

frontiers are more
 and more often being broken down by
 reactionary, imperialist capitalism. There is every sign that
 imperialism will leave its successor, socialism, a heritage of
 less democratic frontiers, a number: of
 annexations in Europe and ill other parts of the
 world. Is it to he supposed that victorious
 socialism, restoring and implementing full democracy all along
 the line, will refrain from democratically
 demarcating state frontiers and ignore the “sympathies” of the
 population? Those questions need only be stated to make it quite
 clear that our Polish colleagues are sliding down from Marxism
 towards imperialist Economism.


The old Economists, who made a caricature of Marxism, told the
 workers that “only the economic” was of importance to
 Marxists. The new Economists seem to think either that the
 democratic state of victorious socialism will exist without
 frontiers (like a “complex of sensations” without matter) or
 that frontiers will be delineated “only” in accordance with the
 needs of production. In actual fact its frontiers will be
 delineated democratically, i.e., in accordance with the
 will and “sympathies” of the population. Capitalism
 rides roughshod over these sympathies, adding more obstacles to
 the rapprochement of nations. Socialism, by oiganising
 production without class oppression, by ensuring the
 well-being of all members of the state, gives full
 play to the “sympathies” of the population, thereby
 promoting and greatly accelerating the drawing together and
 fusion of the nations.


To give the reader a rest from the heavy and clumsy Economism
 let us quote the reasoning of a socialist writer who is outside
 our dispute. That writer is Otto Bauer, who also has his own
 “pet little point”—“cultural and national autonomy”—but
 who argues quite correctly on a large number of most important
 questions. For example, in Chapter 29 of his book The
 National Question and Social-Democracy, be was doubly right
 in noting the use of national ideology to cover up
 imperialist policies. In Chapter 30, “Socialism and the
 Principle of Nationality”, he says:


“The socialist community will never be able to include whole
 nations within its make-up by the use of force. Imagine the
 masses of the people, enjoying the blessings of national
 culture, baking a full and active part in legislation

    

and
 government, and, finally, supplied with arms—would it be
 possible to subordinate such a nation to the rule of an alien
 social organism by force? All state power rests on the force of
 arms. The present-day people’s army, thanks to an ingenious
 mechanism, still constitutes a tool in the hands of a definite
 person, family or class exactly like the knightly and mercenary
 armies of the past. The army of the democratic community of a
 socialist society is nothing but the people armed, since it
 consists of highly cultured persons, working without compulsion
 in socialised workshops and taking full part in all spheres of
 political life. In such conditions any possibility of alien rule
 disappears.”


This is true. It is impossible to abolish national (or
 any other political) oppression under capitalism, since this
 requires the abolition of classes, i.e., the
 introduction of socialism. But while being based on economics,
 socialism cannot be reduced to economics alone. A foundation—socialist production—is essential for the abolition
 of national oppression, but this foundation must also
 carry a democratically organised state, a democratic army,
 etc. By transforming capitalism into socialism the proletariat
 creates the possibility of abolishing national
 oppression; the possibility becomes reality
 “only”—“only”!—with the establishment of full
 democracy in all spheres, including the delineation of state
 frontiers in accordance with the “sympathies” of the population,
 including complete freedom to secede. And this, in turn, will
 serve as a basis for developing the practical elimination of even the slightest national friction and the
 least national mistrust, for an accelerated drawing together and
 fusion of nations that will be completed when the state
 withers away. This is the Marxist theory, the theory
 from which our Polish colleagues have mistakenly departed.

2.Is Democracy “Practicable” Under Imperialism

The old polemic conducted by Polish Social-Democrats against the self-determination of nations is based entirely on
 the argument that it is “impracticable” under capitalism. As
 long ago as 1903 we, the Iskra supporters, laughed at
 this argument in the Programme Commission of the Second

    

Congress
 of the R.S.D:L.P.. and said that it way repetition of the
 distortion of Marxism preached by the (late lamented)
 Economists. In our theses we dealt with this error in particular
 detail and it is precisely on this point, which contains the
 theoretical kernel of the whole dispute, that the Polish
 comrades did not wish to (or could not?) answer any of
 our arguments.


To prove the economic impossibility of self-determination would
 require an economic analysis such as that used to prove the
 impracticability of prohibiting machines or introducing
 labour-money, etc. No one has even attempted to make such an
 analysis. No one will maintain that it has been possible to
 introduce “labour-money” under capitalism “by way of exception”
 in even one country, in the way it was possible for one small
 country to realise this impracticable self-determination, even
 without war or revolution, “by way of exception”, in the era of
 the most rabid imperialism (Norway, 1905).


In general, political democracy is merely one of the possible
 forms of superstructure above capitalism
 (although it is theoretically the normal one for “pure”
 capitalism). The facts show that both capitalism and imperialism
 develop within the framework of any political form and
 subordinate them all. It is, therefore, a basic
 theoretical error to speak of the “impracticability” of
 one of the farms and of one of the demands of
 democracy.


The absence of an answer to these arguments from our Polish
 colleagues compels us to consider the discussion closed on this
 point. To make it graphic, so to say, we made the very concrete
 assertion that it would be “ridiculous” to deny the
 “practicability” of the restoration of Poland today, making it
 dependent on the strategic and other aspects of the present
 war. No reply was forthcoming!


The Polish comrades simply repeated an obviously
 incorrect assertion (S. II, 1), saying that “in questions of the
 annexation of foreign territories, forms of political democracy
 are pushed aside; sheer force is decisive.... Capital will never
 allow the people to decide the question of their state
 frontiers...” As though “capital” could “allow the people” to
 select its civil servants, the servants of imperialism!
 Or as though weighty decisions on important democratic

    

questions, such as the establishment of a republic in
 place of a monarchy, or a militia in place of a regular army,
 were, in general, conceivable without “sheer
 force”. Subjectively, the Polish comrades want to make Marxism
 “more profound” but they are doing it altogether
 unsuccessfully. Objectively, their phrases about
 impracticability are opportunism, because their tacit assumption
 is: this is “impracticable” without a series of
 revolutions, in the same way as democracy as a whole,
 all its demands taken together. is impracticable under
 imperialism.


Once only, at the very end of S. II,1, in the discussion on
 Alsace, our Polish colleagues abandoned the position of
 imperialist Economism and approached the question of one of the
 forms of democracy with a concrete answer and not with general
 references to the “economic”. And it was precisely this approach
 that was wrong! It would, they wrote, he “particularist,
 undemocratic” if some Algatians, without asking the
 French, were to “impose” on them a union with Alsace, although
 part of Alsace was German-oriented and this threatened war!!!
 The confusion is amusing: self-determination presumes (this is
 in itself clear, and we have given it special emphasis in our
 theses) freedom to separate from the oppressor state;
 hut the fact that union with a state presumes the
 consent of that state is something that is “not
 customarily” mentioned in polities ally more than the
 “consent” of a capitalist to receive profit or of a
 worker to receive wages is mentioned in
 economics! It is ridiculous even to speak of Such a
 thing.


If one wants to be a Marxist politician, one should, in
 speaking of Alsace, attack the German socialist
 scoundrels for not fighting for Alsace’s freedom to
 secede and attack the French socialist
 scoundrels for making their peace with the French bourgeoisie
 who want to annex the whole of Alsace by force—and both of
 them for serving the imperialism of
 “their own” country and for fearing a separate state, even if
 only a little one—the thing is to show how
 the socialists who recognize self-determination would
 solve the problem ill a few weeks without going against the will
 of the Alsatians. To argue, instead, about the
 horrible danger of the French Alsatians “forcing” themselves on
 France is a real pearl.

    

 3. What Is Annexation?

We raised this question in a most definite manner in our theses
(Section 7).[4]

The Polish comrades did not reply to
 it: they evaded it, insisting (1) that they are against
 annexations and explaining (2) why they are against them. It is
 true that these are very important questions. But they are
 questions of another kind. If we want our principles to
 be theoretically sound at all, if we want them to he clearly and
 precisely formulated, we cannot evade the
 question of what an annexation is, since this concept
 is used in our political propaganda and agitation The
 evasion of the question in a discussion between colleagues
 cannot be interpreted as anything but desertion of
 one’s position.


Why have we raised this question? We explained this when we
 raised it. It is because “a protest against annexations is
 nothing but recognition of the right to Self-determination”. The
 concept of annexation usually includes: (1) the concept of force
 (joining by means of force); (2) the concept of oppression by
 another nation (the joining of “alien” regions, etc.),
 and, sometimes (3) the concept of violation of the
 status quo. We pointed this out in the theses and this
 did not meet with any criticism.


Can Social-Democrats be against
 the use of force in general, it may be asked? Obviously
 not. This means that we are against annexations not because they
 constitute force, but for some other reason. Nor can
 the Social-Democrats be for the status quo.
 However you may twist and turn, annexation is
 violation of the self-determination of a nation, it is
 the establishment of state frontiers contrary to the
 will of the population.


To be against annexations means to be in favor of the right to self-determination. To be “against the forcible retention of any nation within the frontiers of a given state” (we deliberately employed this slightly changed formulation of the same idea in Section 4 of our
theses,[5] and the Polish  comrades answered us with complete clarity at  the beginning of their S. I, 4, that they “are against the forcible retention of oppressed nations within the frontiers of the annexing state”)—is the same as
 being in favour of the self-determination of nations.

We do not want to haggle over words. If there is a party that
 says in its programme (or in a resolution binding on all the
 form does not matter) that it is against
annexations,[6]

against the forcible retention of oppressed nations within tile frontiers of  its state, we declare our complete agreement in
 principle with that party. It would be absurd to insist on the
 word “self-determination”. And if there are people in
 our Party who want to change words in this
 spirit, who want to amend Clause 9 of our Party Programme, we
 should consider our differences with such comrades to
 he anything but a matter of principle!


The only thing that matter is political clarity and theoretical
 soundness of our slogans.


In verbal discussions on this question—the importance of
 which nobody will deny, especially now, in view of the
 war—we have met the following argument (we have not come
 across it in the press): a protest against a known evil
 does not necessarily mean recognition of a positive concept that
 precludes the evil. This is obviously an unfounded argument and,
 apparently, as such has not been reproduced in the press. If a
 socialist party declares that it is “against the forcible
 retention of an oppressed nation within the frontiers of the
 annexing state”, it is thereby committed to
renounce retention by force when it comes to power.


We do not for one moment doubt that if Hindenburg were
 to accomplish the semi-conquest of Russia tomorrow and this
 semi-conquest were to be expressed by the appearance of a now
 Polish state (in connection with the desire of Britain
 and France to weaken tsarism somewhat), something that is quite
 “practicable” from the standpoint of the economic laws of
 capitalism and imperialism, and if, the day after tomorrow, the
 socialist revolution were to be victorious in Petrograd,
 Berlin and Warsaw, the Polish socialist government, like the
 Russian and German socialist governments, would
 renounce tile “forcible retention” of, say, the

    

Ukrainians, “within the frontiers of the Polish state”. If there
 were members of the Gazeta Robotnicza Editorial Board
 in that government they would no doubt sacrifice their “theses”,
 thereby disproving the “theory” that “the right of
 self-determination is not applicable to a socialist society”. If
 we thought otherwise we should not put a comradely discussion
 with the Polish Social-Democrats on the agenda but would rather
 conduct a ruthless struggle against them as chauvinists.


Suppose I were to go out into the streets of any European city
 and make a public “protest”, which I then published in the
 press, against my not being permitted to purchase a man as a
 slave. There is no doubt that people would have the right to
 regard me as a slave-owner, a champion of the principle, or
 system, if you like of slavery. No one would be fooled by the
 fact that my sympathies with slavery were expressed in the
 negative form of a protest and not in a positive form (“I am for
 slavery”). A political “protest” is quite the
 equivalent of a political programme; this is so obvious that one
 feels rather awkward at having to explain it. In any case, we
 are Firmly convinced that on the part of the Zimmerwald Left, at
 any rate—we do not speak of the Zimmerwald group as a whole
 since it contains Martov and other Kautskyites—we shall not
 meet with any “protest” if we say that in the Third
 International there will be no place for people capable of
 separating a political protest from a political programme, of
 counterpoising the one to the other, etc.


Not wishing to haggle over words, we take the liberty of
 expressing the sincere hope that the Polish Social-Democrats
 will try soon to formulate, officially, their proposal to delete
 Clause 9 from our Party Programme (which is also
 theirs) and also from the Programme of the
 International (the resolution of the 1896 London Congress), as
 well as their own definition of the relevant political
 concepts of “old and new annexations” and of “the forcible
 retention of an oppressed nation within the frontiers of the
 annexing state”.


Let us now turn to the next question.

    

 4. For or Against Annexations?

In S. 3 of Part One of their theses the Polish comrades declare
 very definitely that they are against any kind of
 annexation. Unfortunately, in S. 4 of the same part we find an
 assertion that must he considered annexationist. It opens with
 the following ... how can it he put more delicately?... the
 following strange phrase:


“The starting-point of Social-Democracy’s struggle against
 annexations, against the forcible retention of oppressed nations
 within the frontiers of the annexing state is renunciation
 of any defence of the fatherland [the authors’
 italics], which, in the era of imperialism, is defence of the
 rights Of one’s own bourgeoisie to oppress and plunder foreign
 peoples....”


What’s this? How is it put?


“The starting-point of the struggle against annexations is
 renunciation of any defence of the fatherland....” But
 ally national war and any national revolt can be called “defence
 of the fatherland” and, until now, has been generally
 recognised as such! We are against annotations, but...
 we mean by this that we are against the annexed waging a war
 for their liberation from those who have annexed them,
 that we are against the annexed revolting to liberate themselves
 from those who have annexed them! Isn’t that an annexationist
 declaration?


The authors of the theses motivate their... strange assertion by
 saying that “in the era of imperialism” defence of the
 fatherland amounts to defence of the right of one’s own
 bourgeoisie to oppress foreign peoples. This, however, is true
 only in respect of all imperialist war, i.e., in
 respect of a war between imperialist powers or groups
 of powers, when both belligerents not only oppress
 “foreign peoples” but are fighting a war to decide
 who shall have a greater share in oppressing foreign
 peoples!


The authors seem to present the question of “defence of the
 fatherland” very differently from the way it is presented by our
 Party. We renounce “defence of the fatherland” in an
 imperialist war. This is said as clearly as it can be
 in the Manifesto of our Party’s Central Committee and in

    

the
 Berne
resolutions[7]

reprinted in the pamphlet
 Socialism and War, which has been published
 both in German and French. We stressed this twice in our theses
 (footnotes to Sections 4 and
6).[8]

The authors of the Polish
 theses seem to renounce defence of the fatherland
 in general, i.e., for a national war
 as well, believing, perhaps, that in the “era of
 imperialism” national wars are impossible. We say
 “perhaps” because the Polish comrades have not
 expressed this view in their theses.


Such a view is clearly expressed in the theses of the German
 internationale group and in the Junius pamphlet which
 is dealt with ill a special
article.[9]

 In addition to what is
 said there, let us note that the national revolt of an annexed
 region or country against the annexing country may he called
 precisely a revolt and not a war (we have heard this objection
 made and, therefore, cite it here, although we do not
 think this terminological dispute a serious one). in any case,
 hardly anybody would risk denying that annexed Belgium. Serbia,
 Galicia and Armenia would call their “revolt” against those who
 annexed them “defence of the fatherland” and would do so in
 all justice. It looks as if the Polish comrades are
 against this type of revolt on the grounds that there
 is also a bourgeoisie in these annexed countries which
 also oppresses foreign peoples or, more exactly, could
 oppress them, since the question is one of the “right
 to oppress”. Consequently, the given war or revolt is not
 assessed on the strength of its real social content
 (the struggle of an oppressed nation for its liberation from the
 oppressor nation) but the possible exercise of the
 “right to oppress” by a bourgeoisie which is at present
 itself oppressed. If Belgium, let us say, is annexed by Germany
 in 1917, and in 1918 revolts to secure her liberation, the
 Polish comrades will be against her revolt on the grounds that
 the Belgian bourgeoisie possess “the right to oppress foreign
 peoples”!

 

There is nothing Marxist or even revolutionary in this
 argument. If we do not want to betray socialism we
 must support every revolt against our chief enemy, the
 bourgeoisie of the big states, provided it is not the revolt of
 a reactionary class. By refusing to support the revolt of
 annexed regions we become, objectively, annexationists. It is
 precisely in the “era of imperialism”, which is the era of
 nascent social revolution, that the proletariat will today
 give especially vigorous support to any revolt of the annexed
 regions so that tomorrow, or simultaneously, it may attack the
 bourgeoisie of the “great” power that is weakened by the revolt.


The Polish comrades, however, go further in their
 annexationism. They are not only against any revolt by the
 annexed regions; they are against any restoration of
 their independence, even a peaceful one! Listen to this:


“Social-Democracy, rejecting all responsibility for the
 consequences of the policy of oppression pursued by imperialism,
 and conducting the sharpest struggle against them, does not
 by any means favour the erection of new frontier
 posts in Europe or the re-erection of those swept
 away by imperialism” (the authors’ italics).


Today “imperialism has swept away the frontier posts” between
 Germany and Belgium and between Russia and
 Galicia. International Social-Democracy, if you please, ought to
 be against their re-erection in general, whatever the means. In
 1905, “in the era of imperialism”, when Norway’s autonomous Diet
 proclaimed her secession from
 Sweden, and Sweden’s war against Norway, as preached by the
 Swedish reactionaries, did not take place, what with the
 resistance of the Swedish workers and tile international
 imperialist situation—Social-Democracy ought to have been
 against Norway’s secession, since it undoubtedly meant “the
 erection of now frontier posts in Europe”!!


This is downright annexationism. There is no need to refute it
 because it refutes itself. No socialist party would risk taking
 this stand: “We oppose annexations in general but we sanction
 annexations for Europe or tolerate them once they have been
 made”....


We need deal only with the theoretical sources of the error that
 has led our Polish comrades to such a
 patent...

    

“impossibility”. We shall say further on why there is
 no reason to make exceptions for “Europe”. The following two
 phrases from the theses will explain the other sources of the
 error:


“Wherever the wheel of imperialism has rolled over and crushed
 an already formed capitalist state, the political and economic
 concentration of the capitalist world, paving the way for
 socialism, takes place in the brutal form of imperialist
 oppression....”


This justification of annexations is not Marxism but
 Struveism. Russian Social-Democrats who remember the
 1890s in Russia have a good knowledge of this manner of
 distorting Marxism, which is common to Struve, Cunow, Legien and
 Co. In another of the theses (II, 3) of the Polish comrades we
 read the following, specifically about the
 German Struveists, the so-called “social-imperialists”:


(The slogan of self-determination) “provides the
 social-imperialists with an opportunity, by demonstrating the
 illusory nature of that slogan, to represent our struggle
 against national oppression as historically unfounded
 sentimentality, thereby undermining the faith of the
 proletariat in the scientific validity of the Social-Democratic
 programme....”


This means that the authors consider the position of the German
 Struveists “scientific”! Our congratulations.


One “trifle”, however, brings down this amazing argument which
 threatens to show that the Lensches, Cunows and Parvuses are
 right in comparison to us: it is that the Lensches are
 consistent people in their own way and in issue No. 8-9 of the
 chauvinist German Glocke--we deliberately
 quoted it in our theses—Lensch demonstrates
 simultaneously both the “scientific invalidity” of the
 self-determination slogan (the Polish Social-Democrats
 apparently believe that this argument of Lensch’s is
 irrefutable, as can be seen from their arguments in the theses
 we have quoted) and the “scientific invalidity” of the
 slogan against annexations!!


For Lensch had an excellent understanding of that simple truth
 which we pointed out to those Polish colleagues who showed no
 desire to reply to our statement: there is no difference “either
 political or economic”, or even logical, between the
 “recognition” of self-determination and the

    

“protest” against
 annexations. If the Polish comrades regard the arguments of the
 Lensches against self-determination to he irrefutable, there is
 one fact that has to be accepted: the Lensches also use
 all these arguments to oppose the struggle against
 annexations.


The theoretical error that underlies all the arguments of our
 Polish colleagues has led them to the point of becoming
 inconsistent annexationists.

5. Why Are Social-Democrats Against Annexations?

In our view the answer is obvious: because annexation violates
 the self-determination of nations, or, in other words, is a form
 of national oppression.


In the view of the Polish Social-Democrats there have to be
 special explanations of why we are against annexations,
 and it is these (I, 3 in the theses) that inevitably enmesh the
 authors in a further series of contradictions.


They produce two reasons to “justify” our opposition to
 annexations (the “scientifically valid” arguments of the
 Lensches notwithstanding):


First: “To the assertion that annexations in Europe are
 essential for the military security of a victorious imperialist
 state, the Social-Democrats counterpose the fact that
 annexations only serve to sharpen antagonisms, thereby
 increasing the danger of war....”


This is an inadequate reply to the Lensches because their chief
 argument is not that annexations are a military necessity but
 that they are economically progressive and under
 imperialism mean concentration. Where is the logic if the Polish
 Social-Democrats in the same breath recognise the progressive
 nature of such a concentration, refusing to re-erect
 frontier posts in Europe that have been swept away by
 imperialism, and protest against annexations?


Furthermore, the danger of what wars is increased by
 annexations? Not imperialist wars, because they have other
 causes: the chief antagonisms in the present imperialist war are
 undoubtedly those between Germany and Britain, and between
 Germany and Russia. These antagonisms have nothing to do with
 annexations. It is the danger of national
    

wars and
 national revolts that is increased. But how can one declare
 national wars to be impossible in “the era of
 imperialism”, on the one hand, and then speak of the
 “danger” of national wars, on the other? This is not logical.


The second argument: Annexations “create a gulf between the
 proletariat of the ruling nation and that of the oppressed
 nation... the proletariat of the oppressed nation would unite
 with its bourgeoisie and regard the proletariat of the ruling
 nation as its enemy. Instead of the proletariat waging an
 international class struggle against the international
 bourgeoisie it would be split and ideologically corrupted...”


We fully agree with these arguments. But is it logical to put
 forward simultaneously two arguments on the same question
 which cancel each other out. In S. 3 of the first part
 of the theses we find the above arguments that regard
 annexations as causing a split in the proletariat, and
 next to it, in S. 4, we are told that we must oppose the
 annulment of annexations already effected in Europe and favour
 “the education of tire working masses of the oppressed and the
 oppressor nations in a spirit of solidarity in struggle”. If the
 annulment of annexations is reactionary “sentimentality”,
 annexations must not he said to create a “gulf” between
 sections of the “proletariat” and cause a “split”, but should,
 on the contrary, he regarded as a condition for the bringing
 together of the proletariat of different nations.


We say: In order that we may have the strength to accomplish the
 socialist revolution and overthrow the bourgeoisie, the workers
 must unite more closely and this close union is promoted by the
 struggle for self-determination, i.e., the struggle against
 annexations. We are consistent. But the Polish comrades who say
 that European annexations are “non-annullable” and national
 wars, “impossible”, defeat themselves by contending “against”
 annexations with the use of arguments about national
 wars! These arguments are to the effect that annexations
 hamper the drawing together and fusion of workers of
 different nations!


In other words, the Polish Social-Democrats, in order to contend
 against annexations, have to draw for arguments on the
 theoretical stock they themselves reject in
 principle.


The question of colonies makes this even more obvious.

    

 6. Is it Right to Contrast “Europe” With the
 Colonies in the Present Question?

Our theses say that the demand for the immediate liberation of
 the colonies is as “impracticable” (that is, it cannot be
 effected without a number of revolutions and is not stable
 without socialism) under capitalism as the self-determination of
 nations, the election of civil servants by the people, the
 democratic republic, and so on—and, furthermore, that the
 demand for the liberation of the colonies is nothing more than
 “the recognition of the right of nations to self-determination”.


The Polish comrades have not answered a single one of these
 arguments. They have tried to differentiate between “Europe” and
 the colonies. For Europe alone they become inconsistent
 annexationists by refusing to annul any annexations once these
 have been made. As for the Colonies, they demand
 unconditionally: “Get out of the colonies!”


Russian socialists must put forward the demand: “Get out of
 Turkestan, Khiva, Bukhara, etc.”, hut, it is alleged, they would
 be guilty of “utopianism”, “unscientific sentimentality” and so
 on if they demanded a similar freedom of secession for Poland,
 Finland, the Ukraine, etc. British socialists must demand: “Get
 out of Africa, India, Australia”, but not out of Ireland. What
 are the theoretical grounds for a distinction that is so
 patently false? This question cannot be evaded.


The chief “ground” of those opposed to self-determination is its
 “impracticability”. The same idea, with a nuance, is expressed
 in the reference to “economic and political concentration”.


Obviously, concentration also comes about with the
 annexation of colonies. There was formerly an economic
 distinction between the colonies and the European
 peoples—at least, the majority of the latter—the
 colonies having been drawn into commodity exchange but
 not into capitalist production. imperialism changed
 this. Imperialism is, among other things, the export of
 capital. Capitalist production is being transplanted to
 the colonies at an ever increasing rate. They cannot he
 extricated from dependence on European finance capital. From the
 military standpoint,

    

as well as from the standpoint of expansion,
 tile separation of tile colonies is practicable, as a general
 rule, only under socialism; under capitalism it is practicable
 only by way of exception or at the cost of a series of revolts
 and revolutions both in the colonies and the metropolitan
 countries.


The greater part of the dependent nations in Europe are
 capitalistically more developed than the colonies (though not
 all, the exceptions being the Albanians and many non-Russian
 peoples in Russia) But it is just this that generates greater
 resistance to national oppression and annexations! Precisely
 because of this, the development of capitalism is more
 secure in Europe under any political conditions, including
 those of separation, than in the colonies.... “There,” the
 Polish comrades say about the colonies (I, 4), “capitalism is
 still confronted with the task of developing tile
 productive forces independently....” This is even more
 noticeable in Europe: capitalism is undoubtedly developing the
 productive forces more vigorously, rapidly and independently in
 Poland, Finland, the Ukraine and Alsace than in India,
 Turkestan, Egypt and other straightforward colonies. In a
 commodity producing society, no independent development, or
 development of any sort whatsoever, is possible without
 capital. In Europe the dependent nations have both their
 own capital and easy access to it on a wide range of
 terms. The colonies have no capital of their own, or
 none to speak of, and under finance capital no colony can obtain
 any except on terms of political submission. What then, in face
 of all this, is the significance of the demand to liberate the
 colonies immediately and unconditionally? Is it not clear that
 it is more “utopian” in the vulgar, caricature-“Marxist” sense
 of the word, “utopian”, in the sense in which it is used by the
 Struves, Lenches, Cunows, with tile Polish comrades
 unfortunately following in their footsteps? Any deviation from
 the ordinary, the commonplace, as well as everything that is
 revolutionary, is here labeled “utopianism”. But revolutionary
 movements of all kinds—including national
 movements—are more possible, more practicable, more
 stubborn, more conscious and more difficult to defeat in Europe
 than they are in the
 colonies.

 

Socialism, say the Polish comrades (I, 3), “will be able to give
 the underdeveloped peoples of tile colonies unselfish,
 cultural aid without ruling over them”. This is perfectly
 true. But what grounds are there for supposing that a great
 nation, a great state that goes over to socialism, will not he
 able to attract a small, oppressed European nation by
 means of “unselfish cultural aid”? It is the freedom to secede
 “granted” to the colonies by the Polish
 Social-Democrats that will attract the small but
 cultured and politically exacting oppressed nations of
 Europe to union with great socialist states, because under
 socialism a great state will mean so many hours
 less work a day and so much more pay a
 day. The masses of working people, as they liberate themselves
 from the bourgeois yoke, will gravitate irresistibly
 towards union and integration with the great, advanced socialist
 nations for the sake of that “cultural aid”, provided
 yesterday’s oppressors do not infringe on the long-oppressed
 nations’ highly developed democratic feeling of self-respect,
 and provided they are granted equality in everything, including
 state construction, that of, experience in organising
 “their own” state. Under capitalism this “experience”
 means war, isolation, seclusion, and the narrow egoism of the
 small privileged nations (Holland, Switzerland). Under socialism
 the working people themselves will nowhere consent to seclusion
 merely for the above-mentioned purely economic motives, while
 the variety of political forms, freedom to secede, and
 experience in state organisation—there will he all this
 until the state in all its forms withers away—will be the
 basis of a prosperous cultured life and an earnest that the
 nations will draw closer together and integrate at an ever
 faster pace.


By setting the colonies aside and contrasting them to Europe the
 Polish comrades step into a contradiction which immediately
 brings down the whole of their fallacious argument.

7. Marxism or Proudhonism?

By way of an exception, our Polish comrades parry our reference
 to Marx’s attitude towards the separation of Ireland directly
 and not indirectly. What is their objection?

    

References to
 Marx’s position from 1848 to 1871, they say, are “not of the
 slightest value”. The argument advanced in support of this
 unusually irate and peremptory assertion is that “at one and the
 same time” Marx opposed the strivings far independence of the
 “Czechs, South Slavs.
etc.”^^(105)^^


The argument is so very irate because it is so very
 unsound. According to the Polish Marxists, Marx was simply a
 muddlehead who “in one breath” said contradictory things! This
 is altogether untrue, and it is certainly not Marxism. It is
 precisely the demand for “concrete” analysis, which our Polish
 comrades insist on, but do not themselves apply, that
 makes it necessary for us to investigate whether Marx’s
 different attitudes towards different concrete “national”
 movements did not spring from one and the same
 socialist outlook.


Marx is known to have favoured Polish independence in
 the interests of European democracy in its struggle
 against the power and influence—or, it might he said,
 against the omnipotence and predominating reactionary
 influence—of tsarism. That this attitude was
 correct wits most clearly and practically demonstrated in 1849,
 when the Russian serf army crushed the national liberation and
 revolutionary-democratic rebellion in Hungary. From that time
 until Man’s death, and even later, until 1890,when there was a
 danger that tsarism, allied with France, would wage a
 reactionary war against a non-imperialist and
 nationally independent Germany, Engels stood first and foremost
 for a struggle against tsarism. It was for this reason, and
 exclusively for this reason, that Marx and Engels were
 opposed to the national movement of the Czechs and South
 Slavs. A simple reference to what Marx and Engels wrote in 1848
 and 1841) will prove to anyone who is interested in Marxism in
 real earnest and not merely for the purpose of brushing Marxism
 aside, that Marx and Engels at that time drew a clear
 and definite distinction between “whole reactionary
 nations” serving as “Russian outposts” in Europe, and
 “revolutionary nations” namely, the Germans, Poles and
 Magyars. This is a fact. And it was indicated at the
 time with incontrovertible truth: in 1848
 revolutionary nations fought for liberty, whose principal enemy
 was tsarism,

    

whereas the Czechs, etc., were in fact reactionary
 nations, and outposts of tsarism.


What is the lesson to be drawn from this concrete
 example which must he analysed concretely if there is
 any desire to be true to Marxism? Only this: (1) that the
 interests of the liberation of a number of big and very big
 nations in Europe rate higher than the interests of the movement
 for liberation of small nations; (2) that the demand for
 democracy must not be considered in isolation but on a
 European—today we should say a world—scale.


That is all there is to it. There is no hint of any repudiation
 of that elementary socialist principle which the Poles forget
 but to which Marx was always faithful—that no
 nation can be free if it oppresses other nations. If tile
 concrete situation which confronted Marx when tsarism dominated
 international politics were to repeat itself, for instance, in
 the form of a few nations starting a socialist revolution (as a
 bourgeois-democratic revolution was started in Europe in 1848),
 and other nations serving as the chief bulwarks of
 bourgeois reaction—then me too would have to be in favour
 of a revolutionary war against the latter, in favour of
 “crushing” them, in favour of destroying all their outposts, no
 matter what small-nation movements arose in them. Consequently,
 instead of rejecting any examples of Marx’s tactics—this
 would mean professing Marxism while abandoning it in practice—we
 must analyse them concretely and draw invaluable lessons for
 the future. The several demands of democracy, including
 self-determination, are not an absolute, but only a small
 part of the general-democratic (now: general-socialist)
 world movement. In individual concrete casts, the part
 may contradict the whole; if so, it must be
 rejected. It is possible that the republican movement in one
 country may be merely an instrument of the clerical or
 financial-monarchist intrigues of other countries; if so,
 we must not support this particular, concrete
 movement, but it would be ridiculous to delete the demand for a
 republic from the programme of international Social-Democracy on
 these grounds.


In what way has the concrete situation changed between the
 periods of 1848–71 and 1898–1916 (I take the most important
 landmarks of imperialism as a period: from the

    

Spanish-American
 imperialist war to the European imperialist war)? Tsarism has
 manifestly and indisputably ceased to be the chief mainstay of
 reaction, first, because it is supported by international
 finance capital, particularly French, and, secondly, because of
 1905. At that time the system of big national states—the
 democracies of Europe—was bringing democracy and socialism
 to tile world in spite of
tsarism.[10]

Marx and Engels did not live
 to see the period of imperialism. The system now is a handful of
 imperialist “Great” Powers (five or six in number), each
 oppressing other nations: and this oppression is a
 source for artificially retarding the collapse of capitalism,
 and artificially supporting opportunism and social-chauvinism in
 the imperialist nations which dominate the world. At that time,
 West-European democracy, liberating the big nations, was opposed
 to tsarism, which used certain small-nation movements for
 reactionary ends. Today, the socialist proletariat, split into
 chauvinists, “social-imperialists”, on the one hand, and
 revolutionaries, on the other, is confronted by an
 alliance of tsarist imperialism and advanced capitalist,
 European, imperialism, which is based on their common oppression
 of a number of nations.


Such are the concrete changes that have taken place in the
 situation, and it is just these that; the Polish
 Social-Democrats ignore, in spite of their promise to he
 concrete! Hence the concrete change in the application
 of the same socialist principles: formerly the main
 thing was to fight “against tsarism” (and against certain
 small-nation movements

    

that it was using for
 undemocratic ends), and for the greater revolutionary peoples of
 the West; the main thing today is to stand against the
 united, aligned front of the imperialist powers, the imperialist
 bourgeoisie and the social-imperialists, and for the
 utilisation of all national movements against imperialism for
 the purposes of the socialist revolution. The more
 purely proletarian the struggle against the general
 imperialist front now is, the more vital, obviously, is the
 internationalist principle: “No nation can be free if it
 oppresses other nations”.


In the name of their doctrinaire concept of social
 revolution, the Proudhonists ignored the international role of
 Poland and brushed aside the national movements. Equally
 doctrinaire is the attitude of the Polish Social-Democrats, who
 break up the international front of struggle against
 the social-imperialists, and (objectively) help the latter by
 their vacillations on the question of annexations. For it is
 precisely the international front of proletarian struggle that
 has changed in relation to the concrete position of the small
 nations: at that time (1848–71) the small nations were important
 as the potential allies either of “Western democracy” and the
 revolutionary nations, or of tsarism; now (1898–1914) that is no
 longer so; today they are important as one of the nutritive
 media of the parasitism and, consequently, the
 social-imperialism of the “dominant nations”. The important
 thing is not whether one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of the small
 nations are liberated before the socialist revolution, but the
 fact that in the epoch of imperialism, owing to objective
 causes, the proletariat has been split into two international
 camps, one of which has been corrupted by the crumbs that fall
 from the table of the dominant-nation bourgeoisie—obtained, among other things, from the double or triple
 exploitation of small nations—while the other cannot
 liberate itself without liberating the small nations. without
 educating the masses in an anti-chauvinist, i.e.,
 anti-annexationist, i.e., “self-determinationist”, spirit.


This, the most important aspect of the question, is ignored by
 our Polish comrades, who do not view things from the
 key position in the epoch of imperialism, the
 standpoint of the division of the international proletariat into
 two camps.

 

Here are some other concrete examples of their
 Proudhonism: (1) their attitude to the Irish rebellion of 1916,
 of which later: (2) the declaration in the theses (11, 3, end of
 S. 3) that the slogan of socialist revolution “must not be
 overshadowed by anything”. The idea that the slogan of socialist
 revolution can he “overshadowed” by linking it up with
 a consistently revolutionary position on all questions,
 including the national question, is certainly profoundly
 anti-Marxist.


The Polish Social-Democrats consider our programme
 “national-reformist”. Compare these two practical proposals:
 (1) for autonomy (Polish theses, III, 4), and (2) for freedom to
 secede. It is in this, and in this alone, that our programmes
 differ! And is it not clear that it is precisely the first
 programme that is reformist and not the second’ A reformist
 change is one which leaves intact the foundations of the power
 of the ruling class and is merely a concession leaving its power
 unimpaired. A revolutionary change undermines the
 foundations of power. A reformist national programme does
 not abolish all the privileges of the ruling
 nation; it does ,lot establish complete equality; it
 does not abolish national oppression in all its
 forms. An “autonomous” nation does not enjoy rights equal
 to those of the “ruling” nation; our Polish comrades could not
 have failed to notice this had they not (like our old
 Economists) obstinately avoided making an analysis of
 political concepts and categories. Until 1905
 autonomous Norway, as a part of Sweden, enjoyed tile widest
 autonomy, hut she was not Sweden’s equal. Only by her free
 secession was her equality manifested in
 practice and proved (and let us add in parenthesis
 that: it was this free secession that created the basis for a
 more intimate and more democratic association, founded on
 equality of rights). As long as Norway was merely autonomous,
 the Swedish aristocracy had one additional privileges; and
 secession did not “mitigate” this privilege (the essence of
 reformism lies in mitigating an evil and not in
 destroying it), but eliminated it altogether
 (the principal criterion of the revolutionary character
 of a programme).


Incidentally, autonomy, as a reform, differs in
 principle from freedom to Recede, as a revolutionary
 measure. This is unquestionable. Bat as everyone knows, in
 practice a reform

    

is often merely a step towards revolution. It
 is autonomy that enables a nation forcibly retained within the
 boundaries of a given state to crystallise into a nation, to
 gather, assess and organise its forces, and to select the most
 opportune moment for a declaration ... in the
 “Norwegian” spirit: We, the autonomous diet of such-and-such a
 nation, or of such-and-such a territory, declare that
 the Emperor of all the Russias has ceased to be King of Poland,
 etc. The usual “objection” to this is that such questions are
 decided by wars and not by declarations. True: in the vast
 majority of cases they are decided by wars (just as questions of
 the form of government of big states are decided, in the vast
 majority of cases, only by was and revolutions). However, it
 would do no harm to reflect whether such an “objection”
 to the political programme of a revolutionary party is
 logical. Are we opposed to wars and revolutions for
 what is just and beneficial to the proletariat, for
 democracy and socialism?


“But we cannot be in favour of a war between great nations, in
 favour of the slaughter of twenty million people for the sake
 of the problematical liberation of a small nation with a
 population of perhaps ten or twenty millions!” Of course not!
 And it does not mean that we throw complete national equality
 out of our Programme; it means that the democratic interests of
 one country must he subordinated to the democratic interests of
 several and all countries. Let us assume that between
 two great monarchies there is a little monarchy whose kinglet is
 “hound” by blood and other ties to the monarchs of both
 neighbouring countries. Let us further assume that the
 declaration of a republic in the little country and the
 expulsion of its monarch would in practice lead to a
 war between the two neighbouring big countries for the
 restoration of that or another monarch in the little
 country. There is no doubt that all international
 Social-Democracy, as well as the really internationalist section
 of Social-Democracy in the little country, would be
 against substituting a republic for the monarchy in
 this case. The substitution of a republic for a monarchy is not
 an absolute, but one of the democratic demands, subordinate to
 the interests of democracy (and still more, of course, to those
 of the socialist proletariat) as a whole. A case like this would
 in all probability not give rise to the slightest

    

disagreement
 among Social-Democrats in any country. But if any
 Social-Democrat were to propose on these grounds that
 the demand for a republic be deleted altogether from the
 programme of international Social-Democracy, he would certainly
 be regarded as quite mad. He would be told that after all one
 must not forget the elementary logical difference between the
 general and the particular.


This example brings us, from a somewhat different angle, to the
 question of the internationalist education of the
 working class. Can such education—on the necessity and
 urgent importance of which differences of opinion among the
 Zimmerwald Left are inconceivable—be concretely
 identical in great, oppressor nations and in small,
 oppressed nations, in annexing nations and in annexed nations?


Obviously not. The way to the common goal-complete equality, the
 closest association and tile eventual amalgamation of
 all nations—obviously runs along different routes
 in each concrete case, as, let us say, the way to a paint in the
 centre of this page runs left from one edge and right, from the
 opposite edge. If a Social-Democrat from a great, oppressing,
 annexing nation, while advocating the amalgamation of nations in
 general, were for one moment to forget that “his” Nicholas II,
 “his” Wilhelm, George, Poincare, etc., also stand for
 amalgamation with small nations (by means of
 annexations)—Nicholas II for “amalgamation” with Galicia,
 Wilhelm II for “amalgamation” with Belgium, etc.—such a
 Social-Democrat would he a ridiculous doctrinaire in theory and
 an abettor of imperialism in practice.


In the internationalist education of the workers of the
 oppressor countries, emphasis must necessarily he laid on their
 advocating freedom for the oppressed countries to secede and
 their fighting for it. Without this there can be no
 internationalism. It is our right and duty to treat every
 Social-Democrat of an oppressor nation who fails to
 conduct such propaganda as a scoundrel and an imperialist. This
 is an absolute demand, even where the chance of
 secession being possible and “practicable” before the
 introduction of socialism is only one in a thousand.


It is our duty to teach the workers to be “indifferent” to
 national distinctions. There is no doubt about that. But it must
 not be the indifference of the annexationists.

    

A member of an oppressor nation must be “indifferent”
 to whether small nations belong to his state or to
 a neighboring state, or to themselves, according to where
 their sympathies lie: without such “indifference” he is
 not a Social-Democrat. To be an internationalist
 Social-Democrat one must not think only of one’s own
 nation, but place above it the interests of all
 nations, their common liberty and equality. Everyone accepts
 this in “theory” hut displays an annexationist indifference in
 practice. There is the root of the evil.


On the other hand, a Social-Democrat from a small nation must
 emphasise in his agitation the second word of our
 general formula: “voluntary integration” of nations. He
 may, without failing in his duties as an internationalist, he in
 favour of both the political independence of his nation
 and its integration with the neighboring state of X, Y, Z,
 etc. But in all cases he must fight against
 small-nation narrow-mindedness, seclusion and isolation,
 consider the whole and the general, subordinate the particular
 to the general interest.


People who have not gone into the question thoroughly think that
 it is “contradictory” for the Social-Democrats of oppressor
 nations to insist on the “freedom to secede”, while
 Social-Democrats of oppressed nations insist on the “freedom to
 integrate”. However, a little reflection will
 show that there is not, and cannot be, any other road
 to internationalism and the amalgamation of nations, any other
 road from the given situation to this goal.


And now we come to the specific position of Dutch and
 Polish Social-Democrats.

8. The Specific and the General in the Position of the
 Dutch and Polish Social-Democrat Internationalists

There is not the slightest doubt that the Dutch and Polish
 Marxists who oppose self-determination are among the best
 revolutionary and internationalist elements in international
 Social-Democracy. How can it be then that their
 theoretical arguments as we have seen, are a mass of errors?
 There is not a single correct general argument, nothing but
 imperialist Economism!

 

It is not at all due to the especially bad subjective qualities
 of the Dutch and Polish comrades but to the specific
 objective conditions in their countries. Both countries are:
(1) small and helpless in the present-day “system” of great powers;
(2) both are geographically situated between tremendously
 powerful imperialist plunderers engaged in the most bitter
 rivalry with each other (Britain and Germany; Germany and
 Russia);
(3) in both there are terribly strong memories and
 traditions of the times when they themselves were great
 powers: Holland was once a colonial power greater than England,
 Poland was more cultured and was a stronger great power than
 Russia and Prussia;
(4) to this day both retain their privileges
 consisting in the oppression of other peoples: the Dutch
 bourgeois owns the very wealthy Dutch East Indies; the Polish
 landed proprietor oppresses the Ukrainian and Byelorussian
 peasant; the Polish bourgeois, the Jew, etc.


The particularity comprised in the combination of these four
 points is not to be found in Ireland, Portugal (she was at one
 time annexed to Spain), Alsace, Norway, Finland, the Ukraine,
 the Lettish and Byelorussian territories or many others. And it
 is this very peculiarity that is the real essence of
 the matter! When the Dutch and Polish Social-Democrats reason
 against self-determination, using general arguments,
 i.e., those that concern imperialism in general, socialism in
 general, democracy in general, national oppression in general,
 we may truly say that they wallow in mistakes. But one has only
 to discard this obviously erroneous shell of general
 arguments and examine the essence of the question from
 the standpoint of the specific conditions obtaining in
 Holland and Poland for their particular position to become
 comprehensible and quite legitimate. It may be said,
 without any fear of sounding paradoxical, that when the Dutch
 and Polish Marxists battle against self-determination they do
 not say quite what they mean, or, to put it another way, mean
 quite what they
say.[11]

 

We have already quoted one example in our
theses.[12]

Gorter is
 against the self-determination of his own country but
 in favour of self-determination for the Dutch East
 Indies, oppressed as they are by “his” nation! Is it any wonder
 that we see in him a more sincere internationalist and a
 fellow-thinker who is closer to us than those who recognise
 self-determination as verbally and hypocritically as Kautsky in
 Germany, and Trotsky and Martov in Russia? The general and
 fundamental principles of Marxism undoubtedly imply the duty to
 struggle for the freedom to secede for nations that are
 oppressed by “one’s own” nation, but they certainty do not
 require the independence specifically of Holland to he made a
 matter of paramount importance—Holland, which suffers most
 from her narrow, callous, selfish and stultifying seclusion: let
 the whole world burn, we stand aside from it all, “we” are
 satisfied with our old spoils and the rich “left-overs”, the
 Indies, “we” are not concerned with anything else!


Here is another example. Karl Radek, a Polish Social-Democrat,
 who has done particularly great service by his determined
 struggle for internationalism in German Social-Democracy
 since the outbreak of war, made a Furious attack on
 self-determination in an article entitled “The Right of Nations
 to Self-Determination”
(Lichtstrahlen[20]—Left Radical monthly prohibited by the
Prussian censor,
 edited by J. Borchardt—1915, December 5, Third Year of
 Publication, No. 3). Ha quotes, incidentally, only
 Dutch and Polish authorities in his support and propounds,
 amongst others, the argument that self-determination fosters
 the idea that “it is allegedly the duty of Social-Democrats to
 support any struggle for independence”.


From the standpoint of general theory this argument is
 outrageous, because it is clearly illogical: first, no
 democratic demand can fail to give rise to abuses, unless the
 specific is subordinated to the general; we are not obliged to
 support either “any” struggle for independence or “any”
 republican or anti-clerical movement. Secondly, no formula for
 the struggle against national oppression can fail to suffer from

    

the same “shortcoming”. Radek himself in Berner
 Tagwacht used the formula (1915, Issue 253): “Against old
 and new annexations.” Any Polish nationalist will legitimately
 “deduce” from this formula: “Poland is an annexment, I am
 against annexations, i.e., I am for the independence of
 Poland.” Or I recall Rosa Luxemburg saying in an article written
 in
1908,[21] that the formula: “against
 national oppression” was quite adequate. But any Polish
 nationalist would say—and quite justly—that
 annexation is one of the forms of national oppression,
 consequently, etc.


However, bake Poland’s
 specific conditions in place of these general
 arguments: her independence today is “impracticable”
 without wars or revolutions. To be in favour of an all-European
 war merely for the sake of restoring Poland is to be a
 nationalist of the worst sort, and to place the interests of a
 small number of Poles above those of the hundreds of millions
 of people who suffer from war. Such, indeed, are the “Fracy”
 (the Right wing of the
P.S.P.)[22] who are
 socialists only in word, and compared with whom the Polish
 Social-Democrats are a thousand times right. To raise the
 question of Poland’s independence today, with the
 existing alignment of the neighbouring
 imperialist powers, is really to run after a will-o’-the-wisp,
 plunge into narrow-minded nationalism and forget the necessary
 premise of an all-European or at least a Russian and a German
 revolution. To have put forward in 1908–14 freedom of
 coalition in Russia as an independent slogan would also have meant running after a will-o’-the-wisp, and would, objectively,
 have helped the Stolypin labour party (now the Potresov-Gvozdyov party, which, incidentally, is the same thing). But it would be
 madness to remove freedom of coalition in general from the programme of Social-Democracy!


A third and, perhaps, the most important example. We read in the Polish theses (III, end of 82) that the idea of an independent Polish buffer state is opposed on the grounds that it is an “inane utopia of small impotent groups. Put into effect, it would mean the creation of a tiny fragment of a Polish state
 that would be a military colony of one or another group of Great
 Powers, a plaything of their military or economic interests, an
 area exploited by foreign capital, and a battlefield in future
 war”. This is all very true
    

when used as an argument
 against the slogan of Polish independence
 today, because even a revolution in Poland alone would
 change nothing and would only divert the attention of
 the masses in Poland from the main thing—the
 connection between their struggle and that of the
 Russian and German proletariat. It is not a paradox but a fact
 that today the Polish proletariat as such call help the cause of
 socialism and freedom, including the freedom of
 Poland, only by joint struggle with the
 proletariat of the neighbouring countries, against the
 narrow Polish nationalists. Tile great historical
 service rendered by the Polish Social-Democrats in the struggle
 against the nationalists cannot possibly be denied.


But these same arguments, which are true from the standpoint of
 Poland’s specific conditions in the present
 epoch, are manifestly untrue in the general form in
 which they are presented. So long as there are wars, Poland
 will always remain a battlefield in wars
 between Germany and Russia, hut this is no argument
 against greater political liberty (and, therefore, against
 political independence) in the periods between
 wars. The same applies to the arguments about exploitation by
 foreign capital and Poland’s role as a plaything of foreign
 interests. The Polish Social-Democrats cannot, at the moment,
 raise the slogan of Poland’s independence, for the Poles, as
 proletarian internationalists, can do nothing about it
 without stooping, like the “Fracy”, to humble servitude to
 one of the imperialist monarchies. But it is
 not indifferent to the Russian and German workers
 whether Poland is independent, they take part in annexing her
 (and that would mean educating the Russian and German workers
 and peasants in the basest turpitude and their consent to play
 the part of executioner of other peoples).


The situation is, indeed, bewildering, but there is a way out in
 which all participants would remain internationalists:
 the Russian and German Social-Democrats by demanding for Poland
 unconditional “freedom to secede”; the Polish
 Social-Democrats by working for the unity of the proletarian
 struggle in both small and big countries without putting forward
 the slogan of Polish independence for the given epoch
 or the given period.

    

 8. Engels Letter to Kautsky

In his pamphlet Socialism and Colonial Politics
 (Berlin, 1907), Kautsky, who was then still a Marxist, published
 a letter written to him by Engels, dated September 12, 1882,
 which is extremely interesting in relation to the question under
 discussion. Here is the principal part of the letter.


“In my opinion the colonies proper, i.e., the countries occupied
 by a European population-Canada, the Cape,
 Australia—will all become independent; on the other hand,
 the countries inhabited by a native population, which are simply
 subjugated-India, Algeria, the Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish
 possessions-must be taken over for the time being by the
 proletariat and led as rapidly as possible towards
 independence. How this process will develop is difficult to
 say. India will perhaps, indeed very probably, make a
 revolution, and as a proletariat in process of self-emancipation
 cannot conduct any colonial wars, it would have to be
 allowed to run its course; it would not pass off without all
 sorts of destruction, of course, hut that sort of thing is
 inseparable from all revolutions. The same might also take place
 elsewhere, e.g., in Algeria and Egypt, and would certainly be
 the best thing for us. We shall have enough to do at
 home. Once Europe is reorganised, and North America, that will
 furnish such colossal power and such an example that the
 semi-civilised countries will of themselves follow in their
 wake; economic needs, if anything, will see to that. But as to
 what social and political phases these countries will then have
 to pass through before they likewise arrive at socialist
 organisation, I think we today can advance only rather idle
 hypotheses. One thing alone is certain: the victorious
 proletariat can force no blessings of any kind
 upon any foreign nation without undermining its own victory by
 so doing. Which of course by no means excludes defensive
 wars of various
kinds....”[23]


Engels does not at all suppose that the “economic” alone will
 directly remove all difficulties. An economic revolution will be
 a stimulus to all peoples to strive for
 socialism; but at the same time revolutions—against the
 socialist state—and wars are possible. Politics
 will inevitably adapt themselves to the economy, but not
 immediately

    

or smoothly, not simply, not directly. Engels
 mentions as “certain” only one, absolutely internationalist,
 principle, and this he applies to all “foreign
 nations”, i.e., not to colonial nations only: to force blessings
 upon them would mean to undermine the victory of the
 proletariat.


Just because the proletariat has carried out a social revolution
 it will not become holy and immune from errors and
 weaknesses. But it will be inevitably led to realise this truth
 by possible errors (and selfish interest—attempts to saddle
 others).


We Of the Zimmerwald Left all hold the same conviction as
 Kautsky, for example, held before his desertion of Marxism for
 the defence of chauvinism in 1914, namely, that the socialist
 revolution is quite possible in the very near future—“any day”, as Kautsky himself once put it. National
 antipathies will not disappear so quickly: the hatred—and
 perfectly legitimate hatred—of an oppressed nation for its
 oppressor will last for a while; it will evaporate only
 after the victory of socialism and after the
 final establishment of completely democratic relations between
 nations. If we are to be faithful to socialism we must even now
 educate the masses in the spirit of internationalism, which is
 impossible in oppressor nations without advocating freedom of
 secession for oppressed nations.

10. The Irish Rebellion of 1916

Our theses were written before the outbreak of this rebellion,
 which must be the touchstone of our theoretical views.


The views of the opponents of self-determination lead to the
 conclusion that the vitality of small nations oppressed by
 imperialism has already been sapped, that they cannot play any
 role against imperialism, that support of their purely national
 aspirations will lead to nothing, etc. The imperialist war of
 1914–16 has provided facts which refute such
 conclusions.


The war proved to be an epoch of crisis for the West-European
 nations, and for imperialism as a whole. Every crisis
 discards the conventionalities, tears away the outer

    

wrappings,
 sweeps away the obsolete and reveals the underlying
 springs and forces. What has it revealed from the standpoint of
 the movement of oppressed nations! In the colonies there have
 been a number of attempts at rebellion, which the
 oppressor nations, naturally did all they could to hide by means
 of a military censorship. Nevertheless, it is known that in
 Singapore the British brutally suppressed a mutiny
 Among their Indian troops; that there were attempts at rebellion
 in French Annam (see Nashe Slovo) and in the German
 Cameroons (see the Junius


pamphlet[13]

);

that in Europe, on the one hand, there was a
 rebellion in Ireland, which the “freedom-loving” English, who
 did not dare to extend conscription to Ireland, suppressed by
 executions, and, on the other, the Austrian Government passed
 the death sentence on the deputies of the Czech Diet “for
 treason”, and shot whole Czech regiments for the same “crime”.


This list is, of course, far from complete. Nevertheless, it
 proves that, owing to the crisis of imperialism, the
 flames of national revolt have flared up both in the
 colonies and in Europe, and that national sympathies and
 antipathies have manifested themselves in spite of the Draconian
 threats and measures of repression. All this before the crisis
 of imperialism hit its peak; the power of the imperialist
 bourgeoisie was yet to be undermined (this may he brought
 about by a war of “attrition” but has not yet happened) and the
 proletarian movements in the imperialist countries were
 still very feeble. What will happen when the war has
 caused complete exhaustion, or when, in one state at
 least, the power of the bourgeoisie has been shaken under the
 blows of proletarian struggle, as that of tsarism in 1905?


On May 9, 1916, there appeared in Berner Tagwacht the
 organ of the Zimmerwald group, including some of the Leftists,
 an article on the Irish rebellion entitled “Their Song Is Over”
 and signed with the initials
K. R.[24] It described the
 Irish rebellion as being nothing more nor less than a “putsch”,
 for, as the author argued, “the Irish question was an agrarian
 one”, the peasants had been pacified by reforms, and
 the nationalist movement remained

    

only a “purely urban,
 petty-bourgeois movement, which, notwithstanding the sensation
 it caused, had not much social backing”.


It is not surprising that this monstrously doctrinaire and
 pedantic assessment coincided with that of a Russian
 national-liberal Cadet, Mr. A. Kulisher
 (Rech[25] No. 102, April 15,
 1916), who also labeled the rebellion “the Dublin putsch”.


It is to be hoped that, in accordance with the adage, “it’s an
 ill wind that blows nobody any good”, many comrades,
 who were not aware of the morass they were sinking into by
 repudiating “self-determination” and by treating the national
 movements of small nations with disdain, will have their eyes
 opened by the “accidental” coincidence of opinion held by a
 Social-Democrat and a representative of the imperialist
 bourgeoisie!!


The term “putsch”, in its scientific sense, may be employed
 only when the attempt at insurrection has revealed nothing but a
 circle of conspirators or stupid maniacs, and has aroused no
 sympathy among the masses. The centuries-old Irish national
 movement, having passed through various stages and combinations
 of class interest, manifested itself, in particular, in a mass
 Irish National Congress in America Vorworts, March 20,
 1916) which called for Irish independence; it also
 manifested itself in street fighting conducted by a section of
 the urban petty bourgeoisie and a section of the
 workers after a long period of mass agitation,
 demonstrations, suppression of newspapers, etc. Whoever calls
 such a rebellion a “putsch” is either a hardened
 reactionary, or a doctrinaire hopelessly incapable of envisaging
 a social revolution as a living phenomenon.


To imagine that social revolution is conceivable
 without revolts by small nations in the colonies and in Europe,
 without revolutionary outbursts by a section of the petty
 bourgeoisie with all its prejudices, without a movement
 of the politically non-conscious proletarian and
 semi-proletarian masses against oppression by the landowners,
 the church, and the monarchy, against national oppression,
 etc.-to imagine all this is to repudiate social
 revolution. So one army lines up in one place and says, “We
 are

    

for socialism”, and another, somewhere else and says, “We
 are for imperialism”, and that will he a social revolution! Only
 those who hold such a ridiculously pedantic view could vilify
 the Irish rebellion by calling it a “putsch”.


Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never
 live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution
 without understanding what revolution is.


The Russian Revolution of 1905 was a bourgeois-democratic
 revolution. It consisted of a series of battles in which
 all the discontented classes, groups and elements of
 the population participated. Among these there were masses
 imbued with the crudest prejudices, with the vaguest
 slid most fantastic aims of struggle; there were small groups
 which accepted Japanese money, there were speculators and
 adventurers, etc. But objectively, the mass movement
 was breaking the hack of tsarism and paving the way for
 democracy; for this reason the class-conscious workers led it.


The socialist revolution in Europe cannot be anything
 other than an outburst of mass struggle on the part of all and
 sundry oppressed and discontented elements. Inevitably, sections
 of tile petty bourgeoisie and of the backward workers will
 participate in it—without such participation, mass
 struggle is impossible, without it no revolution is
 possible—and just as inevitably will they bring into the
 movement their prejudices, their reactionary fantasies, their
 weaknesses slid errors. But objectively they will
 attack capital, and the class-conscious vanguard of the
 revolution, the advanced proletariat, expressing this objective
 truth of a variegated and discordant, motley and outwardly
 fragmented, mass struggle, will he able to unite and direct it,
 capture power, seize the banks, expropriate the trusts which all
 hate (though for difficult reasons!), and introduce other
 dictatorial measures which in their totality will amount to the
 overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the victory of socialism,
 which, however, will by no means immediately “purge” itself of
 petty-bourgeois slag.


Social-Democracy, we road in the Polish theses (I, 4), “must
 utilise the struggle of the young colonial bourgeoisie against
 European imperialism in order to sharpen the revolutionary
 crisis in Europe”. (Authors’ italics.)


Is it not clear that it is least of all permissible to contrast
 Europe to the colonies in this respect? The struggle of
 the

    

oppressed nations in Europe, a struggle capable of
 going all the way to insurrection and street fighting, capable
 of breaking down tile iron discipline of the army and martial
 law, will “sharpen the revolutionary crisis ill Europe” to an
 infinitely greater degree than a much more developed rebellion
 in a remote colony. A blow delivered against tile power of the
 English imperialist bourgeoisie by a rebellion in Ireland is a
 hundred times more significant politically than a blow of equal
 force delivered in Asia or in Africa.


The French chauvinist press recently reported the publication in
 Belgium of the eightieth issue of an illegal journal, Free
Belgium.[26] Of course, the chauvinist
 press of France very often lies, but this piece of news seems to
 he true. Whereas chauvinist and Kautskyite German
 Social-Democracy has failed to establish a free press for itself
 during the two years of war, and has meekly borne the yoke of
 military censorship (only the Left Radical elements, to their
 credit be it said, have published pamphlets and manifestos, in
 spite of the censorship)—an oppressed civilised nation
 has reacted to a military oppression unparalleled in ferocity by
 establishing an organ of revolutionary protest! The dialectics
 of history are such that small nations, powerless as an
 independent factor in the struggle against imperialism,
 play a part as one of the ferments, one of the bacilli,
 which help the real anti-imperialist force, the
 socialist proletariat, to make its appearance on the scene.


The general staffs in the current war are doing their utmost to
 utilise any national and revolutionary movement in the enemy
 camp: the Germans utilise the Irish rebellion, tire French—the Czech movement, etc. They are acting quite correctly
 from their own point of view. A serious war would not be treated
 seriously if advantage were not taken of the enemy’s slightest
 weakness and if every opportunity that presented itself were not
 seized upon, the more, so since it is impossible to know
 beforehand at what moment, whore, and with what force some
 powder magazine will “explode”. We would be very poor
 revolutionaries if, in the proletariat’s great war of Liberation
 for socialism, we did not know how to utilise every
 popular movement against every single disaster
 imperialism brings in order to intensify and extend the
 crisis. If we were, on the one

    

hand, to repeat in a thousand
 keys the declaration that we are “opposed” to all national
 oppression and, on the other, to describe the heroic revolt of
 the most mobile and enlightened section of certain classes in an
 oppressed nation against its oppressors as a “putsch”, we should
 be sinking to the same level of stupidity as the Kautskyites.


It is the misfortune of the Irish that they rose prematurely,
 before the European revolt of the proletariat had had
 time to mature. Capitalism is not so harmoniously built
 that the various sources of rebellion can immediately merge of
 their own accord, without reverses and defeats. On the other
 hand, the very fact that revolts do break out at different
 times, in different places, and are of different kinds,
 guarantees wide scope and depth to the general movement; but it
 is only in premature, individual, sporadic and therefore
 unsuccessful, revolutionary movements that the masses gain
 experience, acquire knowledge, gather strength, and get to know
 their real leaders, the socialist proletarians, and in this way
 prepare for the general onslaught, just as certain strikes,
 demonstrations, local and national, mutinies in the army,
 outbreaks among the peasantry, etc., prepared the way for the
 general onslaught in 1905.

11. Conclusion

Contrary to the erroneous assertions of the Polish Social-Democrats, the
demand for the self-determination of nations has
 played no less a role in our Party agitation than, for example,
 the arming of the people, the separation of the church from the
 state, the election of civil servants by the gene pie and other
 points the philistines have called “utopian”. the contrary, the
 strengthening of the national movements after 1905 naturally
 prompted more vigorous agitation by our Party, including a
 number of articles in 1912–13, and the resolution of our Party
 in 1913 giving a precise “anti-Kautskian” definition (i.e., one
 that does not tolerate purely verbal “recognition”) of the
 content of the
point.[14]

 

It will not do to overlook a fact which was revealed at
 that early date: opportunists of various nationalities,
 the Ukrainian Yorkevich, the Bundist Liebman, Scrnkovsky, the
 Russian myrmidon of Potresov and Co., all spoke in
 favour of Rosa Luxemburg’s arguments against
 self-determination! What for Rosa Luxemburg, the Polish
 Social-Democrat, had been merely an incorrect theoretical
 generalisation of tile specific conditions of the
 movement in Poland, became objective opportunist
 support for Great-Russian imperialism when actually’ applied to
 more extensive circumstances, to conditions obtaining in a big
 state instead of a small one, when applied on an
 international scale instead of tile narrow Polish scale. The
 history of trends in political thought (as distinct
 from the views of individuals) has proved the correctness of our
 programme.


Outspoken social-imperialists, such as Lensch still rail both
 against self-determination and the renunciation of
 annexations. As for tile Kautskyites, they
 hypocritically recognise self-determination—Trotsky and
 Martov are going the same way here in Russia. Both
 of them, like Kautsky, say they favour
 self-determination. What happens in practice? Take Trotsky’s
 articles “The Nation and the Economy” in Nashe Slovo,
 and you will find his usual eclecticism: on the one
 hand, the economy unites nations and, on the
 other, national oppression divides them. The
 conclusion? The conclusion is that the prevailing hypocrisy
 remains unexposed, agitation is dull and does not touch
 upon what is most important, basic, significant and closely
 connected with practice—one’s attitude to the
 nation that is oppressed by “one’s own” nation. Martov and other
 secretaries abroad simply preferred to forgot—a
 profitable lapse of memory!—the struggle of their colleague
 and fellow-member Semkovsky against self-determination,
 In the legal press of the Gvozdyovites (Nash Golos)
 Martov spoke in favour of self-determination, pointing
 out the indisputable truth that during the imperialist war it
 does not yet imply participation, etc., but evading the
 main thing—he also evades it in the illegal, free
 press!—which is that even in peace time Russia set
 a world record for the oppression of nations with an imperialism
 that is much more crude, medieval, Economically
 backward and militarily bureaucratic. The Russian
 Social-Democrat

    

who “recognises” tile self-determination of
 nations more or less as it is recognised by Messrs. Plekhanov,
 Potresov and Co., that is, without bothering to fight
 for the freedom of secession for nations oppressed by tsarism,
 is in fact an imperialist and a lackey of tsarism.


No matter what the subjective “good” intentions of Trotsky and
 Martov may be, their evasiveness objectively supports
 Russian social-imperialism. The epoch of imperialism has turned
 all the “great” powers into the oppressors of a number of
 nations, and the development of imperialism will inevitably lead
 to a more definite division of trends in this question in
 international Social-Democracy as well.

Ryazanov has published in Grunberg’ Archives of the History
 of Socialism (1916. I) a very intersting article by Engels
 on the Polish question, written in 1866. Engels emphasises that
 the proletariat must recognize the political independence and
 “self-determination” (“right to dispose itself” [These words are
 in English in the original.]) of the great, major nations of
 Europe, and points to the absurdity of the “principle of
 nationalities” (particularly in its Bonapartist application),
 i.e., of placing any small nation on the same level as these big
 ones “And as is to Russia,” says Engels, “she could only be
 mentioned as the detainer of an immense amount of stolen
 property [i.e., oppressed nations] which would have been
 disgorged on the day of
reckoning.”[27] Both
 Bonapartism and tsarism utilise the small-nation
 movements for their own benefit, against
 European democracy.

Let us recall that all the Polish Social-Democrats
 recognised self-determination in general in
 their Zimmerwald declaration, although their formulation was
 slightly different.
