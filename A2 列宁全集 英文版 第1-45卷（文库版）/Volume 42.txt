Comrade Lenin objects to any agreement whatsoever with

Vikzhel,[1] which tomorrow will be overthrown in a revolutionary
manner, from below. Moscow must be given creative, organising,
revolutionary reinforcements from Petrograd—the sailor element, to be
exact. The food problem: we are getting supplies from the north. After
winning Moscow and overthrowing Vikzhel from below we shall be getting food
supplies from the Volga. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Vikzhel—the All-Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s Trade Union, which was set up at the First All-Russia Inaugural Congress of the Railwaymen held in Moscow in July-August 1917. The Executive was controlled by the Menshoviks and Socialist- Revolutionaries. After the victory of the armed uprising in Petrograd this Executive Committee became a bulwark of the counter-revolution. Taking refuge behind statements declaring its neutrality and calling for cessation of the civil war, Vikzhel hindered the dispatch of revolutionary troops from Petrograd to Moscow, where fighting was still going on for the establishment of Soviet power, and threatened to stop railway traffic. On October 29 (November 11), 1917, Vikzhel adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a new, “homogeneous socialist government” to include representatives of all the parties “from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists”. Vikzhel’s counter-revolutionary policy and actions were strongly disapproved by the rank and file. At the All-Russia Emergency Congress of the Railwaymen held in January 1918 Vikzhel was dismissed, and a new governing body of the Railwaymen’s Union, Vikzhedor, was elected in which the Bolsheviks formed the preponderant majority..

The following to be added: 

Heading: +… and on the requisition of flats of the rich to
relieve the needs of the poor …. 

§ 1. ... plus one article of warm clothing in addition to a
blanket (overcoat, winter coat, jacket, felt boots, etc.). 
 

§ 2. … The term rich flat applies to any flat in which the
number of rooms equals or exceeds the number of permanent occupants. 

The owners of rich flats are obliged immediately, under threat of
confiscation of all their property, to draw up in duplicate a statement
listing the articles of warm clothing they have and of those supplied by
them to the front, one copy of which is to be handed to the House
Committee, the other to the district Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies. 

The owners of rich fiats, under similar threat, are obliged immediately
to submit in duplicate to the same institutions a statement to the effect
that they are vacating one of two rich fiats for the needs of the poor
population of the capital (that is, two rich families having two rich fiats
are obliged to move into one of their fiats during the winter, giving the
other up to the use of the poor population in view of the extreme need
created by the war). 

The house committees shall immediately draw up lists of rich flats
subject to requisition, and the district Soviets of Workers’ Deputies shall
endorse these lists and define the conditions and order in which families
of the poor population are to move into these

flats.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Draft Decree on the Requisition of Articles of Warm Clothing  for the Soldiers at the Front was discussed and approved at a meeting  of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on  November 8 (21), 1917. Lenin’s addenda in regard to the  requisitioning of articles of warm clothing were taken into  consideration in the final wording of the decree (see Pravda No. 184,  November 22 [9], 1917). On the question of “the requisition of  flats of the rich to relieve the needs of the poor”. Lenin’s  amendment formed the basis of a Draft Decree on Installing the  Families of Red Armymen and Unemployed Workers in the Flats  of the Bourgeoisie and on the Normalisation of Housing which  was approved at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet on March 1, 1918 (see Izvestia No. 38, March 2, 1918).

In connection with the results of the elections in
Petrograd in which the Bolsheviks won six

seats,[1] the Associated Press correspondent interviewed
Lenin, the President of the Council of National Commissioners, who was
elated over the great victory of his party. 
 

“What do you think of the results of the elections to the Constituent
Assembly?” the correspondent asked. 

“I think that these elections have proved a great victory for the
Bolshevik Party. The number of votes cast for it in the elections in May,
August and in September is constantly

growing.[2] To get six seats out of twelve in a city in which the
bourgeoisie

(Cadets[3]) are strongest, means to win in Russia.” 

“Do you suppose that the Constituent Assembly of such composition as
the results of the elections in Petrograd indicate will sanction all the
measures of the Government of National Commissioners?” 

“Yes, it will sanction, because there will be no majority, according
to your supposition, against us, and together with the left social

revolutionists[4] we shall constitute a majority in Petrograd (seven
out of twelve).” 

“What parties will enter into the new Council of National
Commissioners?” 

“I do not know positively, but I think that only the left social
revolutionists, besides the Bolsheviks.” 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the elections to the Constituent Assembly in the
Petrograd Electoral Area held between November 42 (25) and 14 (27),
1917. These elections, the preliminary results of which became known on
November 15 (28) and the final results the next day, gave the Bolshevik
Party 424,000 votes and 6 seats in the Constituent Assembly (out of the
twelve assigned to Petrograd); the Cadets received 247,000 votes (4 seats);
the Socialist-Revolutionaries 152,000 votes (2 seats, one of them won by
the Left S.R.s). 

The terms “President of the Council of National
Commissioners” and “Social Revolutionists” used by the correspondent are
better known as “Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars” and
“Socialist-Revolutionaries”. 



[2]
At the elections to the district councils of Petrograd held at the end
of May and beginning of June 1917 the Bolshevik tickets received 20 per
cent of the votes. At the elections to the City Council of Petrograd on
August 20 (September 2) the Bolsheviks received 33 per cent of all the
votes. In speaking of the September elections Lenin was probably referring
to the elections to the district councils of Moscow (held on September 24
(October 71, 1917) at which the Bolsheviks received 51 per cent of all the
votes. This voting, Lenin pointed out, “is in general one of the most
striking symptoms of the profound change which has taken place in the mood
of the whole nation” (see present edition, Vol. 26, p. 80).  



[3]
Cadets—members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the
chief party of the big bourgeoisie in Russia. Founded in October 1905.




[4]
Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.R.s)—a petty-bourgeois party
formed in Russia at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902. After the
victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution of February 1917 the S.R.s,
together with the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of the bourgeois
Provisional Government. 

At the end of November 1917 the Left wing of the party
founded a separate Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The Left S.R.s
formally recognised the Soviet Government and entered into an agreement
with the Bolsheviks, but very soon turned against Soviet power.

Recognising the need for energetic measures to reduce the
salaries of high-ranking office employees and officials in all state,
public and private institutions and enterprises, the Council of People’s
Commissars decrees: 


1) that the salary limit for people’s commissars be fixed at 500 rubles a
month where there are no children, and 100 rubles extra for each child;
housing to be at the

    

rate of not more than 1 room for each member of the family;

2) that all local Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies be
asked to prepare and carry out revolutionary measures to impose special
taxes on high-ranking employees;

3) that the Ministry for Finance be instructed to draft a general law
concerning this reduction;

4) that the Ministry for Finance and all the respective commissars be
instructed to immediately study the estimates of the ministries and cut all
excessively high salaries and pensions. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was written at a meeting of the Council of People’s
Commissars during the discussion of the question of salaries for People’s
Commissars and was adopted with slight amendments. It was published as a
decree of the C.P.C. “Remuneration for People’s Commissars and
High-Ranking Office Employees and Officials” on November23 (December 6),
1917, in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego i Krestyanskogo Pravitelstva 
(Newspaper of the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government)
No. 16. 

The question of remuneration for specialists was
subsequently revised by the Party and the Soviet Government. The decree of
the C.P.C. of January 2 (15), 1918, on “Rates of Pay for High Ranking
Officials” (see p. 52 of this volume) specified that the restriction in
salaries for People’s Commissars did not imply a ban on higher rates of pay
for specialists. The need for making this change in the general system of
remuneration was recognised in a decision of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee dated April 29, 1918.

counter-revolutionary order to the Moscow Military District not to have

This draft was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion at a
meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on November 27 (December 10),
1917 of his proposal for organising “a special commission to carry out a
socialist policy in the financial and economic fields”. The draft was
adopted with slightly altered wording.  



[2]
The Special Defence Council was formed on August 17 (30), 1915 “to
discuss and co-ordinate measures to defend the state and ensure a supply of
munitions and other materials for the Army and Navy” (Osobiye
soveshchaniya i kornitety voennogo vremeni [Special Councils and War-time
Committees], Petrograd, 1917, p. 7). 
 By a decree of the Council of People’s Commissars dated
Decem-ber 11 (24), 1917 the Special Defence Council was charged with “the
annulment of defence orders or their reduction to a normal peace-time
level, and, in connection therewith, the demobilisation of the factories
and their switchover to peace-time production” (Dekrety Sovietskoi
Viasti [Decrees of the Soviet Government],  Vol. 1, Moscow, 1957,
p. 214).

To the demonstration slogans published on 28.XI., I advise
adding: 

Shame to the Right S.R.s and

Chernovites{2} who have broken away from the peasant congress! 

Long live the Second All-Russia Congress of Peasant Deputies, which has
sided with the Soviet power! 

The working people demand that the Constituent Assembly recognise
Soviet power and the Soviet Government! 

Long live the nationalisation of the banks! 

Down with the saboteurs and striking officials! Boycott them, use
revolutionary terrorism against them! 

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

Lenin’s notes “Demonstration Slogans” are an amendment to the appeal
of the Petrograd Soviet “To the Workers and Soldiers of Petrograd” which
was published on November 28 (December 11), 1917, in Pravda and Izvestia,
The Cadets had arranged a demonstration for that day with the intention of
forcing the opening of the Constituent Assembly and carrying out a
counter-revolutionary coup. 

The attempt of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie,
under the leadership of the Cadets, to seize power was frustrated by the
measures taken by the Council of People’s Commissars and the Petrograd
Soviet. 



{2}

Chernov, V. M. (1876-1952)—one of the leaders of the
S.R. Party.  In 1917 lie was Minister of Agriculture in the bourgeois
Provisional Government. After the October Revolution he was one of the
organisers of anti-Soviet revolts.

The C.C. establishes the principle: 

that in all squabbles and personal accusations, the person who makes
such accusations without bringing specific charges before a court shall be
considered a slanderer; 
 

that those who consider themselves affected by such accusations shall be
invited to take legal action.

(α) Recognition of the revolution of 25.X. as a
socialist revolution. 

(β) Rejection of all limitations to this in the spirit
of reversion to the bourgeois-democratic revolution (gradual transition;
"stage" of the bloc with the petty bourgeoisie, etc.). 

(γ) Dictatorship of the proletariat, its special
features as compared with "general", formal (bourgeois) democracy, its
tactics. 

(δ) Soviet power and the power of
the. Bolsheviks. 

(ε) Agreement with the petty bourgeoisie not in the
sense of a bloc for a bourgeois-democratic revolution, not in the sense of
restricting the tasks of the socialist revolution, but exclusively in the
sense of the forms of transition to socialism on the part of different
sections of the petty bourgeoisie. 

(ζ) Bourgeois liberties versus suppression of the
exploiters. 

(η) Saboteurs and capitalists; capitalists and
“public opinion” of the bourgeoisie. 

(θ) The Constituent Assembly and its subordination to
the Soviet power, to the interests and conditions of the civil war. 

(ι) Top organisations (Vikzhel, Peasants’ Central
 Executive Committee, etc.) and the struggle against them. 

(κ) Struggle against reformism in its modern
presentation: 

   (1) the proletariat’s hands tied by
fellow-travellers from among the petty bourgeoisie 

   (2) restricted scope of the revolutionary
struggle of the rank and file 

   (3) rejection of terrorism.

a) what the question is (briefly) [this statement cannot he confined to
a mere reference to the subject, but must set forth the gist  of
the matter]. 

b) what exactly the Council of People’s Commissars is being asked to do
(give money; adopt such-and- such a resolution, etc. The person
introducing the question must state clearly what he wants) 

c) whether the question involves departments under other commissars. If
so, exactly which; whether they have given their findings in



writing?[1]

The Council of People’s Commissars considers that no
changes in the decisions of the Dzerzhinsky Commission or any other
commission appointed by the

Soviets[3] are permissible other than by way of appeal to the Council
of People’s Commissars, and on no account by way of personal order of the
Commissar for Justice. 

The Council of People’s Commissars considers further that the act of
comrades Steinberg and Karelin, who released the arrested men on the night
of 18.XII was illegal both in form and substance, since it contravened not
only the

    

privileges of the Dzerzhinsky Commission but the direct decision of the
Council of People’s Commissars adopted on the evening of 18.XII which
ordered the arrested men to be detained for identification.

This draft was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion of a
statement by F. E. Dzerzhinsky, Chairman of the All-Russia Extraordinary
Commission (Veebeka), at a meeting of the C.P.C. on December 19, 1917
(January 1, 1918). Dzerzhinsky protested against the action of
I. Z. Steinberg, People’s Commissar for Justice, and V. A. Karelin, member
of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Justice, both of them Left
S.R.s. 

The evening before, at a meeting of the C.P.C., Lenin
received a report that the Vecheka had arrested a group of members of the
counter-revolutionary Constituent Assembly Defence Union on the premises of
the Free Economic Society, during an. illegal attempt on their part, made
in defiance of the decree of the C.P.C., to open a “session” of the
Constituent Assembly. The C.P.C. had decided to detain the arrested men in
custody until their identity was established. Steinberg and Karelin visited
the scene, but instead of carrying out the decision of the C.P.C. they
released all the arrested persons without even notifying the Veeheka. Their
action ran counter to the agreement between the Central Committees of the
Bolsheviks and the Left S.R.s for conducting a common line in the
C.P.C. and was a violation of the obligation to pursue a Soviet policy
which the Left S.R.s had taken upon themselves when joining the C.P.C.


The C.P.C. endorsed the draft resolution written by
Lenin. 



[3]
The Dzerzhinsky Commission (Vecheka)—the All-Russia Extraordinary
Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage; the other
commissions referred to were: the Committee of Inquiry of the Petrograd
Soviet, the Naval Committee of Inquiry and the Committee for Combating
Drunken Riots.

There was a time when Plekhanov was a socialist, a
prominent exponent of revolutionary socialism. 

At that time—now, alas, in the limbo of forgotten things—Plekhanov
expressed his opinion on a subject which happens to have vital significance
in the present period. 

It happened in 1903, when the Russian Social-Democrats were framing
their programme at the Second Party Congress. 

The minutes of this Congress contain the following very informative
entry, that might have been written specially for the present day: 


   “Posadovsky. The statements made here for and against the
   amendments strike me as being not a dispute over details but a serious
   difference of opinion; without a doubt we disagree on the following
   fundamental question:

   
should our future policy be governed by certain basic democratic
   principles, admitted to have absolute value, or are all democratic
   principles to be governed exclusively by what is profitable for our
   party? I definitely declare for the latter. There is no democratic
   principle that we could not make subservient to the


interests of our party. (Interjection: “Even
   inviolability of the person?”) Yes!  Inviolability of the person as
   well! As a revolutionary party striving towards its ultimate goal-that
   of a social revolution-we must regard democratic principles exclusively
   from the point, of view of the speediest possible achievement of that
   goal, from the point of view of our party’s interests. If one or another
   demand does not turn out to our advantage we shall not use it. 

   “Therefore I oppose any amendments that are likely in future to
   narrow our freedom of action.” 

   “Plekhanov. I fully support what Comrade Posadovsky has
   said. Every given democratic principle should be examined not on its own
    

   merits, in the abstract, but in its bearing on what may be called the
   basic principle of democracy, namely, on the principle that says: salus
   populi suprema

 lex.[1]

   Translated into the language of the revolutionary, this means that the
   success of the revolution is the highest law. If it were necessary for the
   success of the revolution to restrict the affect of one or another
   democratic principle, it would be criminal to stop at such a
   restriction. As my own personal opinion I would say that even the principle
   of universal suffrage should be regarded from the point of view of this
   basic principle of democracy I have just mentioned. Hypothetically it is
   conceivable that we. Social-Democrats, may have occasion to come out
   against universal suffrage. The bourgeoisie of the Italian republics once
   deprived persons belonging to the nobility of political rights. The
   revolutionary proletariat could restrict the political rights of the upper
   classes the way these classes once restricted the political rights of the
   proletariat. The fitness of such a measure could only be judged by the
   rule: salus revolutionis suprema lex. The same point of view should be
   adopted by us on the question of the duration of parliaments. If, on an
   impulse of revolutionary enthusiasm, the people were to elect a very good
   parliament, a sort of Chambre Introuvable, we should try and make it a long
   parliament; and if the elections turned out to be unfavourable

   we should try and dismiss it not in two years’
   time, but if possible in two weeks”

   (Minutes of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., pp. 168-69). 


The enemies of socialism may be deprived for a time not only of
inviolability of the person, and not only of freedom of the press, but of
universal suffrage as well. A bad parliament should be “dismissed” in two
weeks. The good of the revolution, the good of the working class, is the
highest law. That was how Plekhanov spoke when he was a socialist. That was
how the great majority of the present-day Mensheviks spoke, those same
Mensheviks who are now screaming about “Bolshevik terror”. 

The “good of the revolution” now demands a grim fight against
saboteurs, organisers of military cadet insurrections, and newspapers run
by bankers. When the Soviet authorities embark upon such struggle, the
so-called socialists from the camp of the Mensheviks and S.R.s shout from
all the housetops against civil war and terror. 

When that

Kerensky[2] of yours reintroduced capital punishment at the
front, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? 

When your coalition cabinet, with the hands of the

Kornilovs,[3] machine-gunned whole regiments for showing

    

insufficient enthusiasm for the war, that was not civil war, gentlemen, was
it? 

When those Kerenskys and

Avksentyevs[4] of yours threw 3,000 soldiers into a single prison in
Minsk for “harmful agitation”, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it?


When you suppressed the workers’ newspapers, that was not
terror, gentlemen, was it? 

The only difference is that the Kerenskys, Avksentyevs and

Lieberdans,[5]
hand in glove with the Kornilovs and

Savinkovs,[6] have practised terror
against the workers, soldiers and peasants in the interests of a handful of
landowners and bankers, while the Soviet government is taking strong
measures against the landowners, marauders and their underlings—in
the interests of the workers, soldiers and peasants.

Taking into consideration 
1) that Comrade Lozovsky, from the very beginning of the October Revolution, has expressed opinions which radically diverge from those of the Party and of the revolutionary proletariat in general, but coincide on all major points with the petty-bourgeois negation of the dictatorship of the proletariat as an essential phase in the transition to socialism; 
2) that by his statement of

   November…[1]

in the newspaper Novaya

Zhizn,[2] which has gone over to the bourgeoisie, Comrade
Lozovsky has aroused general indignation not

    

only among all Party people, but among the class-conscious workers at

large[3] and that the resolution of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. concerning Comrade Lozovsky’s expulsion from the Party, passed
soon after this statement had been made, was not announced and carried out
only because of the hopes expressed by some comrades that the vacillations
of Comrade Lozovsky were of a temporary nature caused by his inability to
quickly grasp the significance of the historic upheaval that was taking
place with such extraordinary speed; 

3) that the expectations of the comrades who wished to give Comrade
Lozovsky time to fully grasp the significance of the revolution that took
place, have not been justified and that Comrade Lozovsky’s entire political
conduct and especially his articles in Nos. 7 and 8 of Professionalny

Vestnik[4] point to this comrade’s complete divergence from the
cardinal principles of socialism in his approach to the role of the
proletariat in the socialist revolution; 

4) that membership of the Party by a person who holds an important post
in the trade union movement and is debauching that movement with shoddy
bourgeois ideas, not only compromises the Party and demoralises all
organisational work among the proletariat, but causes enormous practical
harm to the urgent task of organising socialist production by the trade
unions; 

5) that joint work in the ranks of a single Party is impossible with a
person who does not understand the necessity for the dictatorship of the
proletariat, which is recognised by our Party Programme, who does not
understand that without such a dictatorship, that is, without a systematic,
ruthless suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, which sticks at
no bourgeois-democratic formulas, one cannot conceive of any consistently
democratic, leave alone socialist, revolution, nor of any serious measures
for coping with the crisis and economic chaos caused by the war; 
6) that joint work in the ranks o a single Party is impossible with a
person who repudiates the socialist tasks of the proletariat, which has won
political power; with a person who refuses to accept the idea that it is
the duty of the trade unions to take upon themselves state functions and
carry through with the greatest vigour and determination

    

the socialist reorganisation of production and distribution on a
nation-wide scale, 

the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P resolves: that Comrade Lozovsky be expelled
from the R.S.D.L.Party (Bolsheviks) and this resolution be published
without delay.

Decision Of The C.P.C. 

The Council of People’s Commissars approves Comrade

Antonov’s{2} vigorous measures against the Kaledinites and their
accomplices, and at the same time rules that the Commander-in-Chief has the
right to take repressive measures, including sentences of forced labour in
the mines, against capitalist saboteurs who threaten to cause unemployment
and famine. 
2

Addendum To The Decision Of The C.P.C. 

As soon as it becomes possible to set up revolutionary
tribunals they will immediately examine each case of forced labour
assignment, and will either fix the term of such labour or release the
persons from custody.

Re Comrade Shlyapnikov’s inquiry concerning rates of pay
for high ranking officials, the C.P.C. 

1) confirms that the decree establishing 500-ruble monthly salaries for
members of the Council of People’s Commissars is to be interpreted as an
approximate norm for top salaries and contains no prohibition to pay
specialists more; 

2) calls attention once more to the fact that the decree of the
C.P.C. contains a demand for revolutionary measures to be taken to reduce
excessively high

salaries;[2] 

3) directs all People’s Commissars immediately to report what has been
done in fulfilment of this decree; 

4) directs the Commissar for Finance to submit a report as to whether
resolute measures have been taken to collect income tax and eliminate
evasions in the payment of this tax; 

5) directs the local Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
Deputies to take more energetic measures to collect the special tax on
excessively high incomes.

Having decided to postpone publication of the decrees
concerning the Food Council pending the food congress, and while
persistently urging all food supply workers not to leave their posts and to
avoid partial conflicts, 

The Council of People’s Commissars directs the All Russia Food Council
and the Commissariat for Food to send out more and numerically larger armed
detachments as well as commissars to take the most revolutionary measures

    

to expedite shipments, collect and store grain, etc., as well as to wage a
ruthless struggle against profiteers, even to the extent of calling on the
local Soviets to shoot convicted profiteers and saboteurs on the spot. 

The Council of People’s Commissars decrees that rations shall not be
increased and that the dispatch of through goods-trains shall be stepped up
and their progress carefully controlled. 

Urgent steps shall be taken to clear the Petrograd railway junction,
the All-Russia Food Council to be made responsible for this work, 

The All-Russia Food Council shall report daily to the G.PC. on the
progress of food supply work and to submit a plan of food operations. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This motion was adopted at a meeting of the C.P.C. on January 14 (27),
1918. The decree was an attempt to enlist the co-operation of the
All-Russia Food Council, which set itself against the People’s Commissariat
for Food and sabotaged the measures of the Soviet authorities. The first
Soviet Food Congress, which opened in Petrograd on January 14 (27) and was
attended by delegates to the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets,
abolished the Food Council and other organisations handling the food
business, and concentrated this business in the hands of the Soviet
authorities.

Following the decision of the Council of People’s
Commissars dated 14.1 (night)-extract from the journal is herewith
enclosed-we ask the C.C. of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party to
answer the following questions: 

1) When did the Petrograd Committee of the Left S.R.s pass its
resolution refusing to have any members on the staff of the Committee of
Inquiry so long as Kozlovsky was on it? 

2) What is the text of that resolution? 

3) Was the C.C. of the Left S,R. Party aware of this resolution and was
it commented on in the C.C. of the Left S.R.s? 

4) When and by whom (of the Left S.R.s) in the Petrograd Soviet or its
Executive Committee was it reported that the Left SR.s would not join the
Committee of Inquiry so. long as Kozlovsky was on it? 

5) Did the Left S;R.s carry out, the decision of the Petrograd Soviet,
which asked them to present evidence against Kozlovsky within a definite
period?

On January 11(24), 1918, the C.P.C., on the motion of I. Z. Steinberg,
People’s Commissar for Justice, instituted an investigation into the
activities of the Committee of Inquiry under the Petrograd Soviet, and
suspended this Committee pending the results of the investigation. On
January 14 (27) the C.P.C. examined the statement of the chairmen of the
Committee of Inquiry M. Y. Kozlovsky and P. A. Krasikov asking the
C.P.C. to recon- sider its decision, and ordered the Inspection Commission
set up by it to submit the results of its investigation within forty-eight
hours. It also passed a decision to send an inquiry to the C.C. of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionary Party concerning the resolution of the Petrograd
Committee of the Left S.R.s to the effect that it would not be represented
on the Committee of Inquiry. It was in connection with this resolution that
Lenin wrote his inquiry.  The findings of the commission investigating the
activities of the Committee of Inquiry were discussed at meetings of the
C.P.C. On January 21 (February 3) the C.P.C. adopted the draft decree
written by Lenin (see pp. 55-56 of this volume); on February 26 the
C,P.C. found that “all accusations of bribery and other crimes or improper
conduct against the leading members of the Committee of Inquiry are without
foundation” and considered the investiga tion into the activities of the
Committee of Inquiry to be closed, and its leading members Krasikov,
Kozlovsky, Lindeman, Mitzgendler and Rozin to be reinstated in their posts
(Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. 1,  Moscow, 1957, p. 499;
see also p. 62 of this volume).

Considering the wording of the note to § 51. to be inexact
or based on a misunderstanding, since the text, if taken literally, implies
a refusal to recognise the supremacy of the Soviet state

authority,[2] the C.P.C. asks the Navy’s legislative organ to revise
the wording of this note. 

The C.P.C. takes into consideration the statement by representatives of
the Navy that the note in question in no way signifies any repudiation of
the central Soviet authorities, and instructs comrades Proshyan and
Lunacharsky to draw up on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars a
well-reasoned memorandum to the legislative organ of the Navy clarifying
the point of view of the Council of People’s Commissars.

The Council of People’s Commissars asks the Food Congress
immediately, not later than tomorrow morning, to appoint at least three of
the most experienced food supply workers to take part at once in the work
of the existing top food supply bodies and in the discussion of the most
vigorous and revolutionary steps for coping with the famine. 

The Council of People’s Commissars asks the Food Congress to elect a
committee to receive reports from all the groups, institutions and workers
in the food business who are now in conflict, and to forward the
committee’s findings to the C.P.C. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

These draft decisions were written by Lenin during the disussion at the
meeting of the C.P.C. of the report of the presidium of the first Soviet
All-Russia Food Congress, which opened in Petrograd on January 14 (27),
dealing with the organisation of a single centre for handling the food
problem. The resolution of the congress testified to the important progress
achieved in rallying the food supply workers behind the Soviet
government. At the same time the C.P.C. was informed of disagreements
between the People’s Commissar for Food A. G. Schlichter, on the one hand,
and the presidium of the food congress, the All-Russia Food Council
(elected in November 1917 at the food congress in Moscow) and the Food
Department of the Supreme Economic Council, on the other. It was in this
connection that Lenin wrote his second draft.  The first was adopted by the
C.P.C., but the second was not included in the minutes of the meeting (see
pp. 52-53 of this volume).

Having heard the report of the commission investigating the
Committee of Inquiry, the C.P.C. resolves: 

That two extra members be added to the commission, one of them Comrade
Algasov, the other a Bolshevik recommended by Sverdlov. 
 

That the commission be given the right to make searches, seizures and
arrests without preliminary arrangements with any other institutions. 

That the commission be given technical facilities and the right to draw
on funds provided by the Commissariat for Justice. 

That the commission be asked to work faster and more energetically in
order to single out more quickly those whose innocence, in view of the
slanderous nature of the accusations against them, is now

obvious.[1]

This document bears Lenin’s note: “Adopted unanimously”. The decision

Expressing its extreme regret that the proper
commissariats are extremely slow in taking practical steps towards
switching over the metalworks to useful work, the C.P.C, asks the Petrograd
Metalworkers Trade Union, in co-operation with the Commissariat for
Labour, the Petrograd Soviet and the Supreme Economic Council, to start
immediately converting the metalworks to repair work on and production of
railway equipment as well as to the production of goods suitable for
exchange for grain, etc. 

All military orders to be suspended.

When the land is to be used for purposes other than farming
(building, cultural and educational purposes, special industries and
crafts, etc.), the size of the allotment is

    

determined by the local Soviets
in conformity with the requirements of the persons or institutions applying
for permission, depending on the social necessity of the purpose for which
the land is required. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The original draft was drawn up by the Board of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture and then submitted for editing to a committee
of the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets. Lenin, who was a member of
this committee, put in a good deal of work in editing this draft. His
addendum, in a slightly modified wording, was incorporated in the law as
Article 26, constituting Section V headed: “Establishment of Norms of Land
Tenure in Allotting Land Plots for Building, for Agricultural Industries,
for Cultural-Educational Purposes, etc.” (see Decrees of the Soviet
Government, Vol. I, Moscow, 1957, p. 414).

In a long speech lasting two hours, Lenin propounded the
theses that there was no way out for Russia, that it was necessary
immediately to conclude a separate peace,

    

since the Germans were advancing all along the front en masse and we were
powerless to offer any resistance to this million-strong pressure. Having
concluded peace, we would be able to start putting things in order at home
and deepening the socialist revolution, and we would succeed in completing
the radical reforms that would bring us nearer to the introduction in
Russia of a socialist system.

Lenin made a long speech in which he called on the Letts to
support Soviet power on the question of peace. The worn-out Russian people
had to be given peace at all costs. In doing so we would strengthen the
revolution and start building a new young Russia. In any case, the
surrendered territories would not remain occupied, because the Russian
revolution in the near future would spread not only to Germany, but to the
other belligerent powers. The impact of the world social revolution would
compel German imperialism to give up all its conquests.

In accordance with decisions of the Petrograd Soviet to be
passed this evening, we advise you, without losing an hour, to rally all
the workers in order to organise tens

    

of thousands of workers and get all the bourgeoisie, everyone of them to a
man, under the control of these workers, to dig trenches outside the
city. This is the only hope for the revolution. The revolution is in
danger. The line of trenches will be marked out by the military. Prepare
the implements, most important of all organise and mobilise one and
all.

In accordance with the decision adopted by the Central
Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
Deputies at 4.30 a.m. on February 24, the Council of People’s Commissars
has resolved that the terms of peace proposed by the German Government be
accepted and a delegation sent to Brest-Litovsk

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The decision of the C.P.C. was communicated to the German Government in
Berlin at 7 am. on February 24. Nevertheless, in reply to the
radio-telegram of N. V. Krylenko, Supreme Commander-in-chief of the Soviet
troops, proposing that the armistice, previously concluded, should be
considered in force, the German command stated that it was no longer
valid. The German troops continued to advance right up to March 3, when the
peace treaty was signed.

 1
Draft Decision Of The C.P.C.

The Council of People’s Commissars resolves: 

To acknowledge in principle the justice of the Finnish comrades’ desire
that part of the territory mentioned in the Finnish addendum to § 6 of
the draft treaty be handed over to the Finnish Socialist Workers’
Republic. 

The Conciliation Board is instructed to work out ways for the practical
implementation of this

transfer.[2] 

_WRITTEN_ February 25, 1918

 2
Directive of  the C.P.C. to the Russo-Finnish
                    Conciliation Board 

The Council of People’s Commissars gives the following
directive to the Board: 

That it be fair and necessary to ensure full political rights for the
citizens of both republics residing in the other republic. 

       _WRITTEN_  February 25, 1918

 3
Draft Decision For The C.P.C.

Taking into consideration 

first, that next to Finland there is a great city with an extremely
high percentage of the bourgeois population; 

second, that Finland usually has about thirty thousand Finnish workers
living in Petrograd; 
 

third, that the bourgeoisie of Petrograd usually has about two hundred
thousand bourgeois living in Finland;


fourth, that therefore formal
equality among Finnish and Russian citizens (in the matter of enjoying
political rights abroad) would in practice be an obvious privilege for
the. Russian bourgeoisie,


the C.P.C. recommends the Russo-Finnish
Conciliation Board to alter § 13 of the draft to read as follows:
either have § 13 refer, not to citizens, but only to workers and to
peasants who do not exploit other people’s labour;


or add to the former wording of § 13 a reservation to the effect
that Russian citizens coming to Finland who are unable to prove that they
belong to the two above-mentioned categories of working people, shall not
enjoy political rights in

Finland.[3] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 14 (27), 1918, a revolution started in Finland and power
passed into the hands of the proletariat. In February, on the initiative of
the workers’ government of Finland—the Council of People’s
Representatives—negotiations were commenced for signing a peace treaty
between the Russian and Finnish socialist Republics. The draft treaty drawn
up by the Russo-Finnish Conci1iation Board was discussed at meetings of the
Council of People’s Commissars held on February 25, 27 and 28. The treaty
was signed by representatives of the contracting parties on March 1. 

Lenin took an active part in drawing up the treaty. He
talked with the delegates of the Finnish workers’ government, who had been
authorised to sign the treaty, and he edited the draft (see Lenin
Miscellany XXI, pp. 241-43). 

This was the first treaty in history between two
socialist republics, an example of a new type of international
relationshipsfraternal, friendly relationships between equal sovereign
states where the working class had come to power.  



[2]
Lenin’s draft was endorsed at the meeting of the C.P.C. held on
February 25, 1918. 



[3]
Lenin’s motion was adopted at the meeting of the C.P.C. on February 27,
1918. 

§ 13 of the “Treaty Between the Russian and Finnish
Socialist Republics” stated that “The Russian Federative Soviet Republic
grants all the political rights of Russian citizens to Finnish citizens
residing in Russia who belong to the working class or to the peasants who
do not employ other people’s labour, if they live on the territory of
Russia for the purpose of engaging in labour occupations.  

The Finnish Socialist Workers’ Republic, for its part,
undertakes to give citizens of the Russian Federative Soviet Republic in
Finland every facility to enjoy political rights, special consideration
being given to the interests of the working population who have no
permanent domicile” (Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. I,
Moscow, 1957, p. 508).

In view of the statement by Comrade Schroeder that he was
firmly convinced, despite the commission’s opinion, that Comrade
Mitzgendler was guilty of bribery, the C.P.C. considers Comrade Schroeder
in duty bound, first, to repeat this statement in writing, and secondly, to
bring his accusation against Mitzgendler before a court of law immediately
in his own

 1

I fully agree with Comrade Trutovsky that the tendencies
and attempts of which we have heard here are completely at variance with
the aims of the workers’ and peasants’ government and have nothing in
common with

socialism.[4] The aim of socialism is to turn all the means of
production into the property of the whole people, and that does not at all
mean that the ships become the property of the ship workers or the banks
the property of the bank clerks. If people take such paltry things
seriously, then we must do away with

nationalisation,[5] because the whole thing is preposterous. The task,
the aim of socialism, as we see it, is to convert the land and the
industrial enterprises into the property of the Soviet Republic. The
peasant receives land on condition that he works it properly. If the river
transport workers receive ships, it is on condition that they take a
proprietary interest in them: they must submit their estimates if only in
order to have income and expenditure endorsed, and they must take proper
care of the ships. If they cannot do this, we shall remove them. Seeing
that they have been arguing for three weeks, I would propose removing all
of them from, the management, because this shows an utter inaptitude for
organisation, a complete failure to grasp the vital tasks facing the Soviet
Republic.. It is chaos, disorganisation, even worse-it borders on
sabotage. They have started a sort of organised crusade in the Union and
come complaining. Meanwhile, the boats on the Volga stand unrepaired. What
is this? What is it—a madhouse? I am perfectly sure that they realise
that if we go on existing in this chaos we shall bring still greater
calamities down on our heads. The chief condition with us is discipline and
the organised transfer of all property to the people, the transfer of all
sources of wealth to the Soviet Republic, and their strictly disciplined
disposal. So when we are told that the river transport workers will be
private managing proprietors, we obviously cannot agree to it. Soviet power

    

is to do the managing. But you organise a sort of debate preventing unity
among all

  organisations....[1]

If they are dissatisfied, they could have asked for the order to be
rescinded. But they are proposing again that it should be decided first
whom the ships belong to, so that the ship workers should demand a 140 per
cent rise. 
2

I fully agree with many things, but as to the make-up of
the Board, I think the proposal of the river transport comrades is
absolutely unacceptable. For one thing, that is not the question we are
dealing with. The question at issue is that the men are not receiving their
money. That’s simply scandalous, of course. What are we allocating money
for? For it to remain on paper? We have heard a thousand complaints, that
unless the money is sent, our transport will collapse. If the money was
assigned on February 21, and on the 22nd it was not received, then they
should have come on the 23rd complaining. We are suffering from a money
famine, we are short of currency notes, the treasury cannot print all we
need. If we assign money and you unassign it, then actually nothing is
sent. You should have come here on February 23, and not March 3. We
demanded that these tens of millions should be given. I don’t know who is
more to blame. I believe the representatives of the Economic Council. We
cannot satisfy everybody. While we are supplying Petrograd, Moscow is
hungering for currency

     notes…[2]

If people only wrote assignments and did not take any measures, they should
have come here, or called me to the phone or somebody else, and complained
about it. It is a rare week when I do not receive a complaint about money
not being paid out, but from you I never received a single complaint. The
people in charge should be made to answer for it, at least
reprimanded. Under the ruling of February 21 the congress of river
transport workers is obliged to submit the estimates. As regards the
composition of the Management

    

Board, I think we should have corrected our decree rather in the vein
Comrade Shlyapnikov suggested. Paragraph 3 provides for a Board of seven
members. Why this wasn’t inserted is incomprehensible. A number of trade
union representatives could be included in it. I propose that resolute
measures be taken to have this money forwarded immediately by through goods
trains. Then notification should be sent in the usual way saying the money
has been dispatched. As regards the second point I believe the only Board
possible in this instance and most acceptable for everyone, for the Council
of People’s Commissars-the only possible Board is the one appointed
yesterday by the Council of People’s Commissars. There are no grounds for
changing this. I believe we should put this through. And if it’s really
true about the 200 rubles salary, which was adopted as definite and made a
condition for the nationalisation of transport—if that’s a fact, and if
demands are made for levelling up with other organisations, then I
personally raise the question of cancelling nationalisation. There may come
a time shortly when there will be no money at all. We had a single
guarantee on the basis of which we wanted to carry out nationalisation, and
this is being taken away from us. If that’s the case, this measure should
be revoked. Unless this is done we shall be taking on another
responsibility incurring enormous losses. 
3

I find the appointment of a commissar inconvenient in many
respects. We have no indisputable candidate for this post. Therefore we
shall not satisfy all requirements, inasmuch as both sides will be
dissatisfied. The appointment of a commissar will mean setting aside the
Union, and that form is undemocratic. We shall pass a decision for them to
submit a proposal by the morning. If the Board is too unwieldy it could
elect an executive committee. We can implement that organisationally
tomorrow or the day after and have the thing put through organisationally
at once within a fixed period. In appointing an executive committee,
certain people could perhaps be appointed to it. This would

    

be correct, as we would not be setting aside the river transport
workers. They can have no objection to co-operation by the trade unions. If
this doesn’t go through, we can then go ahead with the appointment of a
commissar. The members of this Council know that the question of a
candidate is, of course, a difficult one, and to decide now on appointing a
commissar is to decide nothing, as we quite often waste a whole week over
it. It is best to use this method. There remains one proposal—to revoke
points 5, 6 and 7. Adopted. Under Paragraph 3 six Board members will be
replaced by temporary representatives from the trade unions.

The shorthand record of the C.P.C. meeting from which these speeches

[4]
This refers to the proposal made by representatives of the C.C. of the
Water Transport Workers Trade Union that the management of water transport
be concentrated in the hands of the Trade Union. 

At the meeting of the C.P.C. on March 4, 1918, the
question of setting up a water transport management board was
discussed. According to the decision of the C.P.C. the management of water
transport was entrusted to the Supreme Economic Council, under which a
Waterways Department was being set up; the Board of this Department was to
consist of representatives of the S.E.C., the C.P.C., the Water Transport
Workers Trade Union and the regional . economic councils. 

The C.P.C.. rejected the anarcho-syndicalist demands of
the water transport workers. On Lenin’s motion the C.P.C. decided to
immediately set up a Board on the basis of § 3 of the C.P.C.’s decision of
February 27, to temporarily increase the number of trade union
representatives on the Board, and take steps to immediately dispatch
currency notes to pay the wages of the workers on the Volga and the
Mariinsk system. The chief points of this decision of the C.P.C. were
drafted by. Lenin (see p. 66 of this volume).  



[5]
Lenin is referring to the Decree of the C.P.C. on the Nationalisation
of the Merchant Fleet adopted on January23 (February 5), 1918. The decree
was published on January 26 (February 8) in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego
i Krestanskogo Pravitelstva No. 18.  p. 63 55 This draft was written
by Lenin and endorsed at the meeting of theC.P.C. onMarch4, 1918, following
a discussion of the question of organising a Water Transport Management
Board. (For Lenin’s speeches at this meeting see pp. 63-66 of this volume.)

One of the weakest spots in
Balfour’s speech is the statement that the Japanese are going to help the

Russians.{2} Which Russians? 

In Russia today there is one power, which by its nature is destined to
wage a life and death struggle against the attacks of international
imperialism-that is the Power of the Soviets. The first step, however, of
those Russians, whom the Japanese intend to “help”, as soon as they heard
rumours of the advance of the latter, was to demand the abolition of the
Soviet Power. Should the Japanese move into Siberia, these same "Russians"
whom the Japanese are going to “help”, will demand the abolition of the
Soviets throughout the whole of Siberia. What can take the place of the
Soviet Power? 

The only power that can take its place is a bourgeois government. But
the bourgeoisie in Russia has proved clearly enough that it can only remain
in power with foreign help. If a bourgeois government, supported by outside
help, should establish itself in power in Siberia, and Eastern Russia
become lost to the Soviet, then in Western Russia the Soviet Power would
become weakened to such an extent that it could hardly hold out for long;
it would be followed by a bourgeois government, which would also need
foreign help. The Power to give this help would, of course, not be
England. It is easy to understand what avenues are opened up by this
possibility. 

I confirm that I really said this in a conversation with .Ransome, and
I give permission for it to be printed.

Chapter IV


 ...{1}


Today this task—which is, of course, not yet sufficiently completed
and can never be fully accomplished-no longer stands first among the tasks
facing the Soviet government. The recent congresses of the Soviets, notably
the All-Russia Congress held in Moscow, have shown that the overwhelming
majority of the labouring classes have firmly and consciously sided with
the Soviet power in general and with the Bolshevik Party in particular. It
goes without saying that for any government that is at all democratic the
task of convincing the masses can never be wholly overshadowed—on the
contrary, it will always be among the important tasks of government. As a
key issue, however, it will only have significance for parties of the
opposition or for parties that

    

are fighting for ideals of the future. After the Bolsheviks, first under
tsarism and then under Kerensky, had succeeded in winning over to their
side the majority of the class-conscious active elements of the working
masses, our Party was faced with the task of conquering power and
suppressing the resistance of the exploiters. The task that came to the
fore was that of winning, instead of convincing, Russia. From the end of
October 1917 approximately up to February 1918 the militant or military
task held first place, as it naturally should for any political party
making a bid for power in conditions of sharp and extremely bitter
struggle. Obviously, for the Party of the proletariat, the task of
suppressing the resistance of the exploiters becomes a crucial issue,
because the working masses who side with the proletariat are opposed here
by the united members of the propertied classes armed both with the power
of capital, the power of knowledge and the long-standing, if not age-old,
habit and practice of government. Owing to the special conditions that were
created in Russia under the influence of the unforgotten lessons of the
revolution of 1905 and the influence of the far more painful and harsher
lessons of the present war-owing to these conditions the Bolsheviks
succeeded with comparative ease in solving the problem of winning power
both in the capital and in the chief industrial centres of Russia. But in
the provinces, in places far removed from the centre, and especially in
districts known to have the greatest concentration of a comparatively
backward population rooted in the traditions of the monarchy and
medievalism—the Cossack regions, for instance—Soviet power had to contend
with a resistance that took on military forms and is only now, more than
four months after the October Revolution, coming to an end. At the present
time the task of overcoming and suppressing the resistance of the
exploiters in Russia is, in the main, completed. Russia has been won by the
Bolsheviks chiefly because—as that prominent leader of the
counter-revolutionary Don Cossacks, Bogayevsky himself, recently
admitted—the overwhelming majority of the people even among the Cossacks
have consciously, firmly and definitely sided with the Bolsheviks. But the
special conditions in which the propertied classes are placed economically
enable them naturally to organise not only

    

passive resistance (sabotage), but to repeat the attempt at military
resistance to Soviet power. For that reason the task of suppressing the
resistance of the exploiters cannot be regarded as having been finally
completed. At any rate, it has now obviously been dealt with in its main
aspects and is retreating into the background. The Soviet government will
never for a moment allow itself to forget about this task and will under no
circumstances let itself be diverted from it by any political or so-called
socialist names or declamations. We have to speak about this because both
the Mensheviks and the Right S.R.s act as the most mobile, some-times even
as the most brazen-faced counter-revolutionaries, who wage a sharper
struggle against the Soviet government than the one they had allowed
themselves to wage against the reactionary and landowner governments, and
rely on. their party’s label and designation to protect them. Naturally,
the Soviet government will never falter in its task of suppressing the
resistance of the exploiters, no matter what party banners or what popular
and specious names this resistance may be covered up with. However, at the
present time the task of suppressing resistance has, in the main, been
completed, and the task now confronting us is that of administering the
state. 

This transition from what was once the priority task of convincing the
masses, a transition from the task of winning power and crushing the
resistance of the exploiters by military force to what is now the primary
task of administering the state—this transition is the main feature of
the present moment. The difficulty which the Soviet government is
experiencing is that of bringing home the essentials of this transition to
all the class-conscious elements of the working masses as well as the
people’s political leaders. For it is self-understood that the transition
to the peaceful tasks of governing the whole population irrespective of
classes, a transition that is taking place in conditions when the civil war
is still going on in some places, when grave military dangers are
threatening the Soviet Republic from both the West and the East, and when
the war has caused untold havoc throughout the country—it is
self-understood that such a transition is beset with tremendous
difficulties. 
    

Chapter V

The task of administering the state, which now confronts
the Soviet government, has this special feature, that, probably for the
first time in the modern history of civilised nations, it deals
pre-eminently with economics rather than with politics. Usually the word
“administration” is associated chiefly, if not solely, with political
activity. However, the very basis and essence of Soviet power, like that of
the transition itself from capitalist to socialist society, lie in the fact
that political tasks occupy a subordinate position to economic tasks. And
now, especially after the practical experience of over four months of
Soviet government in Russia, it should be quite clear to us that the task
of administering the state is primarily a purely economic task-that of
healing the country’s wounds inflicted by the war, restoring its productive
forces, organising accountancy in and control over production and
distribution, raising the productivity of labour-in short, it boils down to
the task of economic reorganisation. 

This task can be said to fall under two main headings: I) accounting
and control over production and distribution in the broadest, most
widespread and universal forms of such accounting and control, and 2)
raising the productivity of labour. These tasks can be handled by any form
of collective effort or any form of state passing over to socialism only on
condition that the basic economic, social, cultural and political
preconditions for this have been created in a sufficient degree by
capitalism. Without large-scale machine production, without a more or less
developed network of railways, postal and telegraph communications, without
a more or less developed network of public educational institutions,
neither of these tasks can be carried out in a systematic way on a national
scale. Russia is in a position when quite a number of these initial
preconditions for such a transition actually exist. On the other hand,
quite a number of these preconditions are absent in our country, but can be
borrowed by it fairly easily from the experience of the neighbouring, far
more advanced countries, whom history and international intercourse have
long since placed in close contact with Russia. 
    

Chapter VI

The basic aim of every society going over to a socialist
system consists in the victory of the ruling class-or rather the class that
is growing up to be the ruling class-namely, the proletariat, over the
bourgeoisie as described above. And this task is set before us in a
substantially new way, quite unlike the way it stood in the course of many
decades of the proletariat’s world-wide experience of struggle against the
bourgeoisie. Now, after the gains of the October Revolution, after our
successes in the civil war, victory over the bourgeoisie should stand for
something much bigger, albeit more peaceful in form: namely, victory over
the bourgeoisie, now that it has been secured politically and made good
militarily, should now be achieved in the sphere of organisation of the
national economy, in the sphere of organisation of production, in the
sphere of country-wide accounting and control. The problem of accounting
and control over production was dealt with by the bourgeoisie all the more
effectively in proportion as production expanded and the network of
national economic institutions embracing tens and hundreds of millions of
the population of a large modern state became more ramified. We must handle
this task now in a new way, backed by the predominating position of the
proletariat, supported by the bulk of the working and exploited masses,
making use of those elements of organising talent and technical knowledge
which have been accumulated by the preceding society, and nine-tenths,
perhaps even ninety-nine hundredths of which belong to a class hostile and
opposed to the socialist revolution. 
Chapter VII

German imperialism, which has made the greatest advance not
only in military power and military techniques, but in big industrial
organisations within the framework of capitalism, has incidentally given
proof of its economic progressiveness by being the first country to
introduce labour conscription. Naturally, in the conditions of capitalist

    

society in general and particularly when the monarchist states are waging
an imperialist war, labour conscription is nothing more than a military
convict prison for the workers, a new means of enslaving the working and
exploited masses, a new system of measures for suppressing all protest on
the part of these masses. Nevertheless, there is no question that it is
only because of the economic preconditions created by big capitalism that
such a reform could be put forward and effected. And now we, amid
conditions of appalling post-war economic disorganisation, are obliged to
consider the urgency of a similar reform. Naturally, Soviet power, which is
passing from a capitalist to a socialist organisation of society, must
tackle this problem of labour conscription from the other end, opposite to
that of German imperialism. For the capitalists and imperialists of Germany
labour conscription meant enslavement of the workers. For the workers and
peasant poor in Russia labour conscription should mean, first and foremost,
recruitment of the rich and propertied classes for the discharge of their
social duties. We should start labour conscription with the rich. 
This is necessitated, generally speaking, not only by the fact that the
Soviet Republic is a socialist republic. The necessity arises also from the
fact that it was precisely the wealthy and propertied classes who, by their
resistance, both. military and passive (sabotage), mostly prevented Russia
from healing the wounds inflicted upon her by the war, hampered the
country’s economic rehabilitation and progress. That is why accounting and
control, which should be now considered a problem of paramount importance
in the whole business of state administration, must be applied first of all
to the wealthy and propertied classes. It was the members of these classes
who enjoyed the tribute they collected from the working people, especially
during the war; it was they who used this tribute to evade a task which is
the duty of every citizen, namely, that of lending a hand in healing the
country’s wounds and putting it on its feet again; it was they who used the
plundered tribute to retire and entrench themselves behind impregnable
walls and offer every possible resistance to the victory of the socialist
principle over the capitalist principle of society’s organisation. One of
the chief weapons of such struggle against the Soviets and against
socialism

    

on the part of the wealthy and propertied classes was their possession of
considerable hoards of currency notes. The propertied classes in capitalist
society derived most of their wealth from the land and other means of
production, such as factories, mills, etc., which they owned. The Soviet
government had no difficulty, thanks to the support of the workers and the
great majority of the peasants, in abolishing the right of the landowners
and the bourgeoisie to these basic items of the country’s wealth. It was
not difficult to decree the abolition of private property in land. It was
not difficult to nationalise most of the factories and mills. There is no
doubt that the nationalisation of other big industrial enterprises and
transport facilities is a problem that will easily be dealt with in the
very near future. 

Capitalist society, however, has created another form of wealth, which
is by no means so easy for the Soviet government to deal with. This is
wealth in the form of money, or rather, currency notes. Currency notes
during the war were issued in very great numbers. Russia was cut off by a
wall of military operations from commerce with a number of countries who
had been her largest importers and exporters. The amassment of currency
notes in the hands of the wealthy and propertied classes, practically all
of whom, directly or indirectly, had speculated on the high prices for
military contracts and supplies, is one of the chief means by which the
propertied classes amassed wealth and accumulated power over the working
people. Today the economic position of Russia, as probably of every
capitalist country that has gone through three years of war, is
characterised by the fact that enormous amounts of paper money are
concentrated in the hands of and hoarded by a comparatively small minority,
the bourgeoisie and propertied classes, and this paper money, though
greatly depreciated through massive emission, still represents a claim to
levy tribute on the working population. 
During the transition from capitalist to socialist society it is
absolutely impossible to do without currency notes or to replace them with
new ones in a short space of time. The Soviet government is now confronted
with a difficult task, which nevertheless has to be dealt with at all
costs—the task of combating the resistance of the wealthy, a resistance

    

that takes the form of hoarding and concealing the proofs of their claim to
levy tribute on the working people. These proofs are currency
notes. Naturally, while these currency notes previously gave the right to
acquire and purchase the means of production, such as land, factories,
mills, etc., their significance today has diminished and even been reduced
to naught. The purchase of land has become impossible in Russia after
promulgation of the law on the socialisation of the land, while the
purchase of factories and mills and similar large-scale means of production
and transport has become practically impossible owing to the rapid process
of nationalisation and confiscation of all such large enterprises. And so,
it becomes more and more difficult and almost impossible for members of the
bourgeoisie and propertied classes (including the peasant bourgeoisie) to
acquire money for the purchase of the means of production. But in defending
their old privileges and trying to retard and obstruct as much as they can
the business of socialist reforms within the country, the bourgeoisie are
hoarding and concealing the proofs of their claim to a share in the social
wealth, their claim to levy tribute on the working people, hoarding and
concealing currency notes in order to have a chance, however slender, of
maintaining their position and recovering their old privileges in the event
of difficulties or crises of a military or commercial nature that might yet
beset Russia. 

As regards consumer goods, the possibility of buying them with the sums
of paper money they have accumulated through speculations during the war
remains almost fully with the bourgeoisie and propertied classes, since the
problem of proper rationing and distribution of these goods in a country
like Russia, with her huge population of small peasants, petty artisans or
handicraftsmen, presents tremendous difficulties, and in the prevailing
state of economic chaos caused by the war this problem still remains
practically unsolved. Thus, the Soviet government is obliged to start the
business of accounting and control over production and distribution by an
organised struggle against the wealthy and propertied classes who are
hoarding vast sums in currency notes and evading state control. 
I is estimated that currency notes to the value of about thirty
thousand million rubles have been issued in Russia

    

to date. Of this sum probably no less than twenty thousand million, or
maybe considerably more, are excess hoards unneeded for trade turnover,
which are kept hidden away by members of the bourgeoisie and propertied
classes for motives of self-interest——or class self-interest. 

The Soviet government will have to combine the introduction of labour
conscription with the registration, in the first place, of people belonging
to the bourgeoisie and propertied classes; it will have to demand truthful
statements (declarations) concerning the amount of currency notes
available; it will have to take a number of measures to make sure that this
demand will not remain on paper; it will have to consider transitional
measures for concentrating all stocks of currency notes in the State Bank
or its branches. Unless these measures are taken, the business of
accounting and control over production and distribution cannot be
effectively carried through. 
Chapter VIII

The introduction of labour conscription, however, cannot be
confined to accounting and control over the sums of currency notes
concentrated in the hands of the propertied classes. The Soviet government
will have to apply the principles of labour conscription also to the direct
activities of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes in the sphere of
factory management and the servicing of enterprises by all kinds of
subsidiary labour such as book-keeping, accountancy, clerical work,
technical, administrative and other jobs. In this respect, too, the task of
the Soviet government is now shifting from the sphere of direct struggle
against sabotage to the sphere of business organisation in the new
conditions, since after the victories won by the Soviets in the civil war,
beginning with October and ending February, a breach has virtually been
made in the passive forms of resistance, namely, in the sabotage by the
bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals. It is no accident that at the
present time we are witnessing a sweeping, one might say widespread, change
of sentiment and political behaviour in the camp of the former saboteurs,
i.e., the capitalists and bourgeois intellectuals. In all spheres of
economic and political life

    

we now find a great number of bourgeois intellectuals and capitalist
businessmen offering their services to the Soviet power. And it is up to
the Soviet power now to make use of these services, which are definitely
necessary for the transition to socialism, especially in a peasant country
like Russia, and should be utilised on condition that the Soviet government
has complete ascendancy, direction and control over its new assistants and
co-operators (who had often acted in defiance of this same Soviet power in
the secret hope of protesting it). 

To show how necessary it is for the Soviet government to make use of
the services of bourgeois intellectuals for the transition to socialism, we
venture to use an expression that may at. first glance seem paradoxical: we
must to a considerable extent, take a lesson in socialism from the trust
managers, we must take a lesson in socialism from capitalism’s big
organisers. That this is no paradox anyone can easily see who realises that
it is the big factories, big machine industry, which developed exploitation
of the working people to an unheard-of degree, that it is precisely the big
factories that are the centres of concentration of that class which alone
has been able to destroy the rule of capital and begin the transition to
socialism. It is not surprising, therefore, that in order to solve the
practical problems of socialism, when the organisational aspects of it are
pushed to the fore, we must enlist to the service of the Soviet power a
great number of bourgeois intellectuals, especially from among those who
were engaged in the practical work of organising large-scale capitalist
production, that is to say, first and foremost, those engaged in organising
syndicates, cartels and trusts. Tackling this problem will require of the
Soviet government an exertion of energy and initiative by the working
masses in all fields of the national economy, since the old position held
by the so-called captains of industry-the old position of the masters and
exploiters-this old position the Soviet government will never let them
have. The former captains of industry, the former masters and exploiters,
must be employed as technical experts, managers, consultants, advisers. A
new, difficult, but extremely gratifying problem must be solved, that of
combining all the experience and knowledge which these

    

members of the exploiting classes have accumulated, with the initiative,
energy and work of the broad masses of the working people. For only by this
combination is it possible to build the bridge leading from the old
capitalist to the new socialist society. 

If the socialist revolution had won simultaneously throughout the world
or, at least, in a number of advanced countries, then the task of enlisting
the services of the best technician specialists from among the leaders of
old capitalism to the process of the new organisation of production would
have been made considerably easier. Backward Russia would not have to
wrestle with this problem on her own, as the advanced workers of the
West-European countries would have come to her help and relieved her of
most of the complexities involved in that most difficult of all tasks
arising in the period of transition to socialism known as the
organizational task. In the present situation, when the socialist
revolution in the West is slow and late in coming, and Russia has to speed
up measures for her reorganisation if only in order to save the population
from starvation and afterwards the whole country from a possible foreign
military invasion-in the present situation we have to borrow from the
advanced countries, not their help in socialist organization and the
support of the workers, but the help of their bourgeoisie and capitalist
intellectuals. 
Things have so shaped themselves that we are able to get this help by
organising the assistance of the bourgeois intellectuals in solving the new
organisational problems of the Soviet power. This assistance can be secured
by paying high salaries to the best specialists in every field of
know-ledge, both to the citizens of this country and to those invited from
abroad. Naturally, in a developed socialist society it would appear quite
unfair and incorrect for members of the bourgeois intelligentsia to receive
considerably higher pay than that received by the best sections of the
working class. Under the conditions of practical reality,

      however...{2}

we must solve this pressing problem by means of this (unfair) remuneration
for bourgeois specialists at much higher rates.

    

If, for example, we found that in order to organise production in’ Russia
on new lines, in order to raise the productivity of labour and train our
people in the art of working in better conditions we had to employ for this
purpose, say two thousand big specialists in different fields of knowledge,
specialists from among Russian and still more from among foreign, let us
say, American sources-if we had to pay them fifty or a hundred million
rubles a year, such an expense, from the point of view of the interests of
the national economy, and generally from the point of view of abandoning
out-worn methods of production for newer and more up-to-date methods, would
be fully warranted. Such a sum is worth paying to have our people trained
in better methods and techniques of production, and we shall have to pay it
because, short of the victory of the socialist revolution in other
countries, there is no other possibility of getting this leadership. 

Of course, employment of the labour and guidance of the bourgeois
intellectuals in combination with proper control by the democratic
organisations of the working people and the Soviets, will create a number
of new problems, but these problems will be quite solvable. No difficulties
can stop us from solving these problems, as we have no other way out
towards a higher organization of production under the present
situation. 

I shall go further. Big capitalism has created systems of work
organization, which, under the prevailing conditions of exploitation of the
masses, represent the harshest form of enslavement by which the minority,
the propertied classes, wring out of the working people surplus amounts of
labour, strength, blood and nerves. At the same time they are the last word
in the scientific organization of production, and as such, have to be
adopted by the Socialist Soviet Republic and readjusted to serve the
interests of our accounting and control over production on the one hand,
and raising the productivity of labour, on the other. For instance, the
famous Taylor system, which is so widespread in America, is famous
precisely because it is the last word in reckless capitalist
exploitation. One can understand why this system met with such an intense
hatred and protest on the part of the workers. At the same time, we must
not for a moment

    

forget that the Taylor system represents the tremendous progress of
science, which systematically analyses the process of production and points
the way towards an immense increase in the efficiency of human labour. The
scientific researches which the introduction of the Taylor system started
in America, notably that of motion study, as the Americans call it, yielded
important data allowing the working population to be trained in
incomparably higher methods of labour in general and of work organisation
in particular. 

The negative aspect of Taylorism was that it was applied in conditions
of capitalist slavery and served as a means of squeezing double and triple
the amount of labour out of the workers at the old rates of pay regardless
of whether the hired workers were capable of giving this double and triple
amount of labour in the same number of working hours without detriment to
the human organism. The Socialist Soviet Republic is faced with a task
which can be briefly formulated thus: we must introduce the Taylor system
and scientific American efficiency of labour throughout Russia by combining
this system with a reduction in working time, with the application of new
methods of production and work organisation undetrimental to the labour
power of the working population. On the contrary, the Taylor system,
properly controlled and intelligently applied by the working people
themselves, will serve as a reliable means of further greatly reducing the
obligatory working day for the entire working population, will serve as an
effective means of dealing, in a fairly short space of time, with a task
that could roughly be expressed as follows: six hours of physical work
daily for every adult citizen and four hours of work in running the
state. 

The adoption of such a system would call for very many new skills and
new organisational bodies. Without doubt, this will create for us many
difficulties, and the posing of such a task will even evoke perplexity if
not resistance among certain sections of the working people themselves. We
may be sure, however, that the progressive elements among the working class
will understand the need for such a transition, and that the appalling
extent of the economic chaos witnessed in the towns and villages by
millions of men returning from the front who had been torn away from it all

    

and now saw the full extent of the ravages caused by the war-all this,
without doubt, has prepared the ground for shaping public opinion in this
direction, and we may be sure that the transition which we have roughly
outlined above will be accepted as a practical task by all elements among
the working classes who have now consciously sided with the Soviet
government. 
Chapter IX

An economic transition of the above nature calls also for a
corresponding change in the functions of Soviet leadership. It is quite
natural, in a situation under which the main task was to convince the
majority of the nation or to win power and crush the resistance of the
exploiters, that among the leaders, too, those who came to the fore should
have been agitators in regard to the masses, with whom Soviet power was
more closely connected than any other democratic form of government in the
past. Naturally, winning over the majority of the population or drawing it
into a hard and difficult armed struggle against the exploiters called
above all for agitators of ability. Conversely, the tasks outlined above,
and aimed at establishing accounting and control over production and
distribution, advance to the fore practical managers and
organisers. Accordingly, a certain reappraisal of leaders, certain shifts
among them, should be effected in cases where they are unable to adapt
themselves to the new conditions and the new task. Naturally, the
leadership of a past period accustomed chiefly to agitators’ tasks, would
find such a transition very difficult. Naturally, a number of mistakes
because of this was unavoidable. Both the leaders and the Soviet electorate
at large, that is, the working and exploited masses, must now be made to
see the necessity for this change. 

Among the working and exploited masses there is far more talent and
ability as organisers than as agitators, for the entire work milieu of
these classes demanded of them to a much greater extent the ability to
organise joint work and a system of accounting and control over production
and distribution. Their former conditions of life, on the contrary,

    

provided far less grounds for advancing from their midst leaders possessing
the gift of agitators or propagandists. Perhaps that is why we so often see
now agitators and propagandists by vocation or calling who are compelled to
assume the tasks of organisers, and who have it brought home to them at
every step that they are not quite fit for the job and that the workers and
peasants are disappointed and dissatisfied with them. These mistakes arid
failures of the Soviet government often provoke malicious glee among
classes that are hostile to the idea of a socialist remodelling of society,
among members of the bourgeois parties or those who call themselves
socialist parties but who actually serve the bourgeoisie with zeal-people
like the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. Clear as the
historical inevitability of these mistakes is, it is equally clear that the
shortcomings in this respect are merely the growing pains of the new
socialist society. There can be no doubt that the representatives of Soviet
power all over Russia can and will requalify without great difficulty, that
the practical agitators will learn to occupy a befitting leading
place. This, however, will take time, and only practical experience by
trial and error is capable of bringing a clear realisation of the need for
change, capable of bringing to the fore a number of people, or even a whole
cross-section, fit to deal with the new tasks. There is probably more
organising talent among the workers and peasants than the bourgeoisie
imagine. The trouble is that these talents have no chance to develop, make
good and win a place for themselves in the conditions of capitalist
economy. 

On the other hand, if we clearly recognise today the need for enlisting
new organising talent on a broad scale to the business of running the
state, if we-guided by the principles of Soviet power-start systematically
promoting to leading positions people who have practical experience in this
business, we shall succeed in a short time in building up a new stratum of
practical organisers of production, who, on the basis of the principles
evolved by Soviet power, principles cast among the masses and carried into
practice by the masses under the control of Soviet bodies representing the
mass membership, will win a position for themselves befitting their role of
leadership. 
    

Chapter X

Soviet government will have to pass over, or rather it will
simultaneously have to deal with, the problem of applying corresponding
principles to the bulk of the workers and peasants. Here the task of
introducing labour conscription presents its other side to us. We must
approach this problem differently and highlight different things to those
that have to be applied in the case of the wealthy classes. We see no
essential need for registering all the working people, for keeping an eye
on their stocks of currency notes or their consumption, since all the
conditions of life compel the vast majority of these sections of the
population to work for their living and give them no chance to hoard
anything but the most meagre stocks. Therefore, the task of introducing
labour conscription in this field resolves itself into the task of
establishing labour discipline and self-discipline. 

In the old capitalist society discipline over the working people was
enforced by capital through the constant threat of starvation. This threat
being combined with excessively heavy toil and the workers’ awareness that
they were working, not for themselves, but for somebody else’s benefit, the
conditions of labour became a constant struggle of the great majority of
the working people against the organisers of production. This inevitably
created a psychology in which public opinion among the working people not
only did not frown on poor work or shirkers, but, on the contrary, saw in
this an inevitable and legitimate protest against or means of resistance to
the excessive demands of the exploiters. If the bourgeois press and its
echoers are now shouting so much about anarchy among the workers, about
their lack of discipline and excessive demands, the vicious nature of this
criticism is so obvious that it is not worth dwelling on. It is only
natural that in a country like Russia, where the bulk of the population for
the last three years has endured such appalling hunger and privations,
there should have been a number of cases of utter despondency and a
break-down of organisation. To demand a quick change in this connection or
to expect such changes to be achieved by several decrees, Would be as
absurd as resorting to appeals in an attempt to restore good cheer and
energy into a man who had been

    

beaten within an inch of his life. Only the Soviet government, created by
the working people themselves, and taking into consideration the growing
signs of recovery among them, is in a position to carry out radical changes
in this respect. 

The need for working out systematic measures to improve self-discipline
among the working people has now been fully brought home to the
representatives of Soviet power and its supporters—the political-minded
trade union leaders, for instance. There is no doubt that in the
environment of capitalist society in general, and still more, in the
atmosphere of frenzied, unbridled speculation created by the war, there has
seeped in among the working class an element of demoralisation that will
seriously need coping with. All the more that, owing to the war, the
composition of the working-class vanguard itself has not changed for the
better either. Therefore, the maintenance of discipline among the working
people, the organisation of control over the measure of labour and the
intensity of labour, the introduction of special industrial courts for
establishing the measure of labour, for prosecuting those guilty of
flagrant violations of this measure, and for exercising systematic
influence on the majority with the object of raising this measure-all this
has now been brought to the fore as one of the most urgent tasks of the
Soviet government. 

The only thing is to bear in mind that in bourgeois society one of the
principal instruments of social education, namely, the press, completely
failed to discharge its task in this respect. And to this day our Soviet
press, too, is still largely under the influence of the old habits and old
traditions of bourgeois society. This is evidenced, among other things, by
the fact that our press, like the old bourgeois press, continues to devote
too much space and attention to political trivia, to those personal
questions of political leadership by which the capitalists of all countries
have striven to draw the attention of the masses away from the really
important, profound and cardinal questions of their life.

Having heard the report concerning the disastrous state of
the inland water transport and acquainted itself with the draft decree
drawn up by the Supreme Economic Council in agreement with the Central
Committee of the Water Transport Workers’ Union and the representatives of
the Central Committee of the Volga Fleet,


the C.P.C. endorses this draft as a temporary measure; 

—urgently asks the Nizhni-Novgorod Congress of Water Transport
Employees to put this draft into effect immediately and without any
deviations; 

—should the congress consider it necessary in future to make any
amendments to the decree, the C.P.C. asks the congress to send its
authorised delegation to the C.P.C. to discuss and finally settle the
question of such amendments. 

The C.P.C. impresses upon the congress that the disastrous state of
inland water transport precludes any possibility of delays and makes it
absolutely necessary to strictly and conscientiously carry out all the
orders of

Kavomar.[2] Only on this condition will the C.P.C, be able to justify
the allocation of immense sums on the national fleet in the eyes of the
country. 

V. Ulyanov (Lenin) 

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was proposed by Lenin at a meeting of the Council of
People’s Commissars on March 26, 1918, at which A. G. Shlyap-nikov reported
on the All-Russia Congress of Inland Water Trans-port Workers held in
Moscow on February 14-26, and at which the Draft Decree on the Management
of Water Transport on the Volga presented by Y. Larin was
discussed. Lenin’s motion was adopted by the C.P.C. 

The Nizhni-Novgorod Congress of Water Transport
Employees mentioned in the decision was held in March 25-April 10,
1918. 



[2]
Kavomar- the Board of Management of the Caspian-Volga-Mari-insk
System-was organised under the Decree on the Management of Water Transport
on the Volga for administering the nationalised fleet and all freight and
passenger traffic. By a decision of the C.P.C. dated May 18, 1918,
providing for the reorganisation of the water transport management bodies,
Kavomar was abolished and its functions transferred to Glavvod-Chief Water
Board.

The C.P.C. instructs the representatives, one from the
State Control and one from the Commissariat for Finance, to form a
commission which, not later than tomorrow, shall start an inspection of the
books of the accounting office

    

under the Fuel Department of the S.E.C. and also other accounting offices
of the S.E.C. 

Comrade Bogolepov is charged with summoning the commission. 

The same commission is charged with: first, specially examining the
question of forms of accountancy; second, demanding precise statements in
writing signed by all the persons concerned certifying their participation
in the allocation of money and the conduct of business operations of the
various departments of the S.E.C. 

The commission shall furthermore demand of the people in charge that
they present in the near future the appropriate documents from all
subordinate institutions and persons through whom expenditure of
S.E.C. sums is effected. 




The C.P.C. reprimands the S.E.C. and especially its Fuel Department for
the extremely irregular manner in which they conduct business.

The question under discussion is a draft resolution
concerning labour discipline drawn up by the All-Russia Council of Trade
Unions. Comrade Lenin moves a number of amendments and more definite
wordings of different points in the draft, which he suggests should be
concretised. Piece wages should be fixed for all industries without
exception, and in the case of trades where that is not possible, a system
of bonuses should be introduced. To keep account of productivity and
maintain discipline it is necessary to set up industrial courts, to form
groups of controllers of various trades, not at the enterprise, but from
outside,

    

and enlisting the co-operation of engineers, book-keepers and
peasants. The decree should definitely provide for the introduction of the
Taylor system, in other words, every use should be made of the scientific
methods of work suggested by this system. Without it, productivity cannot
be raised, without it we shall not be able to introduce socialism. In the
application of this system American engineers are to be
enlisted. Naturally, in introducing it, due consideration should be given
to the poor nutrition. The rates of output, therefore, should make
allowance for a low diet. Further-more, it is necessary to organise

      output...[1]

in the transition to socialism may enable us to reduce the working day. The
decree should mention accountancy and the printing of reports concerning
the productivity of the various enterprises. As to penal measures for
breaches of labour discipline, these are to be stricter. Punishment should
go to the length of imprisonment. Dismissal, too, may be applied, but this
will be of an entirely different nature. Under the capitalist system
dismissal was a breach of a civic agreement. Now, a breach of discipline,
especially with the introduction of compulsory labour service, will be a
criminal offence subject to a definite punishment.

Comrade Lenin urged the complete nationalisation of all
trustified enterprises, with the group of capitalists who sponsored the
project being enlisted in the service of the state. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The joint meeting was held to discuss the project for setting up a
trust (“The National Company”) proposed by a group of capitalists headed
by A. P. Meshchersky, Managing-Director of the “Sormovo-Kolomna”
Industrial Association. The Board of the Supreme Economic Council passed a
decision on April 14, 1918, to break off negotiations with Meshchersky; on
April 18, the Council of People’s Commissars turned down Meshchersky’s
project and decided to carry out the nationalisation of the works. A
resolution in favour of nationalisation was passed also by the conference
of delegates of the machine-building works held May 12-18, 1918 (see
present edition,

Vol. 27, pp. 388-89).

With all my heart I greet the first Congress of Soviets of the Don
Republic. 

In particular I heartily subscribe to the words of the resolution
concerning the necessity for carrying through to

    

victory the mounting struggle against the kulak elements of Cossackdom in
the Don region. These words contain an accurate definition of the tasks of
the revolution. This is the kind of struggle that now faces us throughout
Russia. 

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The First Congress of Soviets of the Don Republic, which pro-claimed
itself the supreme Soviet authority on the Don, was held on April 9-12,
1918. It was attended by 750 delegates. Lenin was elected honorary
chairman. The resolution referred to by Lenin was adopted on April 12 by an
overwhelming majority, the Mensneviks’ motion receiving only 2 votes. The
congress approved the Soviet Government’s peaceful policy and stressed in
the reso-lution that it regarded the Don Republic as part of the
R.S. F.S.R. and considered it its chief task to work for the rehabilitation
of the national economy and the creation of a Red Army. The congress
declared the working Cossacks’ readiness to defend Soviet power.

The basic principle to be applied in the distribution of agricultural
machines, etc., should be, on the one hand and in the first place, due
concern for agricultural production, for cultivation of all the land and
for raising the productivity of agriculture, and, on the other, the supply
of agricultural machines, etc., first of all to the working and poor
sections of the rural population, with the common object of providing a

The preliminary conference (on questions raised by Comrades
Spiridonova and Karelin) of members of the, Agricultural Board, Comrades
Sereda and Meshcheryakov, and Lenin, have come to the conclusion that the
questions raised must be regarded as serious political issues and should
therefore be dealt with by the Central Committee of the Russian Communist
Party. 

The conference considers it necessary that these questions be put
before the C.C. urgently and without delay. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This document was written by Lenin in connection with the question,
raised by the leaders of the Left S.R.s M. A. Spiridonova and
V. A. Karelin, that control of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture be
handed over completely to the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, with the
Bolsheviks retaining merely political representation. See also Lenin’s
memorandum on this subject to the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.) (Collected
Works,  Vol. 50, Fifth Russian Edition, Document 133). 

On May 3, 1918, the C.C. of the Russian Communist Party rejected the
claims of the Left S.R.s.

The Commissariat for Labour is authorised to take
extraordinary measures in order, by agreement with the trade unions and
under the indisputable control of the Commissariat for Food, to mobilise
the greatest possible number of public-spirited, organised and
class-conscious workers to help the rural poor in their struggle against
the rich kulaks and to mercilessly suppress profiteering in grain and
attempts to infringe the grain monopoly.

All the various bodies serving the food organisations of
different trades, such as Prodput or Prodvod, etc., are asked to combine
their efforts, their staffs, their agents and detachments with the main
forces of the Commissariat for Food. Refusal to co-operate signifies or
would signify a refusal to support the Soviet authorities, a refusal to

peasants. The only way to combat famine is to join forces.

1. To hoard surpluses of grain and other food products at a
time when the people in Petrograd, in Moscow, and in dozens of
non-agricultural uyezds are not only suffering from a shortage of bread,
but are cruelly starving, is an enormous crime deserving the most ruthless
punishment.  
 

2. The task of fighting famine does not only consist in
pumping grain out of the grain-producing areas, but in having all grain
surpluses, as well as all foodstuffs in general, delivered to and collected
by the state. Unless this is done, there can be no question of any
socialist reforms or of our being able to wage an effective defensive war.

Communism requires and presupposes the greatest possible
centralisation of large-scale production throughout the country. The
all-Russia centre, therefore, should definitely be given the right of
direct control over all the enterprises of the given branch of
industry. The regional centres define their functions depending on local
conditions of life, etc., in accordance with the general production
directions and decisions of the centre. 

To deprive the all-Russia centre o. the right of direct control over
all the enterprises of the given industry throughout the country, as
follows from the commission’s draft, would be regional anarcho-syndicalism,
and not communism. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The draft “Regulations for the Management of the Nationalised
Enterprises” drawn up by the Supreme Economic Council were discussed on
May 28 and 30, 1918, at a meeting of the Organisation of Production Section
of the First All-Russia Congress of Economic Councils. After a lengthy
discussion, the section, under pressure from the “Left” Communists,
adopted the Regulations, which ran counter to the policy of the Party and
the Government. On learning of the speeches of the, “Left” Communists on
the question of management of the nationalised enterprises (see
Collected Works, Vol. 50, Fifth Russian edition, p. 84) and
reading the Regulations drafted by the section, Lenin proposed that they be
examined at the Conciliation Board specially set up on June 2 and at which
the C.P.C. was represented by V. I. Lenin and the S.E.C. by A. I. Rykov and
G. D. Veinberg. The Conciliation Board revised the Regulations on the basis
of Lenin’s comments published here. Despite the “Left” Communists, the
congress, by a majority, adopted the draft of the Conciliation Board.

For the purpose of general guidance in the formation,
composition and activities of the Committees of Poor Peasants a permanent
council is instituted consisting of two representatives from the
Commissariat for Food and one representative from the Commissariat for
Agriculture. 

All local Soviets, food supply agencies and Committees of Poor
Peasants, as well as all other Soviet bodies obey the orders of this
council on pertinent matters. 

…shall be enjoyed by all without restriction, both by local
villagers and newcomers, who do not have surpluses of grain or other food
products, do not possess trade, industrial or other establishments and do
not employ farmhands or

day-labourers.{2} 

Detailed rules on the relations between the Committees of Poor Peasants
and the local Soviets and on the distribution of departmental functions
between the two will be issued specially. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

These proposals of Lenin’s were written apparently at a meeting of the
Council of People’s Commissars on June 8, 1918, when the draft was under
consideration. The draft decree was adopted with substantial
amendments. The All-Russia Central Executive Committee endorsed the decree
on June 11 and Izvestia published it on June 16, 1918 (see
Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. II, Moscow, 1959,
pp. 412-19). The Committees of Poor Peasants were instituted by this
decree. An appraisal of them was given by Lenin in his speech at the First
All-Russia Congress of Land Departments, Poor Peasants’ Committees and
Communes on December 11, 1918 (see present edition,

Volume 28, p. 338). 



{2}

This formulation applies to § 2 of the draft decree. In conformity
with Lenin’s proposal, it was worded as follows: “The right to elect and
be elected to the volost and village Committees of Poor Peasants shall be
enjoyed by all without restriction, both by local villagers and newcomers,
with the exception of avowed kulaks and rich farmers having surpluses of
grain or other food products, having trade or industrial establishments,
and employing farm-hands or hired labour, etc. 

“Note: Those employing hired labour for farm work not
exceeding the subsistence norm may elect and be elected to the Committees
of Poor Peasants” (Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. II,
Moscow, 1959, pp. 416-17.)

Following an exchange of views on the question of
rehabilitating railway transport the Council of People’s Commissars
resolves: that Comrade Nevsky be instructed, on consultation with
colleagues who strictly pursue a Soviet, truly socialist, and not
syndicalist, policy, to submit to the C.P.C. in the near future practical
proposals of measures for combating syndicalism and indiscipline, measures
for disclosing and prosecuting those who contravene Soviet policies,
measures defining the exact responsibility of every official in the
effective discharge of his duties, and measures for enlisting the services
of comrades capable of carrying out administrative work. 

The appointment of a Board in the Commissariat for Railways to be
postponed in view of non-publication of the

decree.{2}

This draft was adopted the same day by the C.P.C. following the report
of Deputy People’s Commissar for Railways V. I. Nevsky. On June 18 the

The democratism of Soviet power and its socialist nature
are expressed in the fact 

that the supreme state authority is vested in the Soviets, which are
made up of representatives of the working people (workers, soldiers and
peasants), freely elected and removable at any time by the masses hitherto
oppressed by capital; 

that the local Soviets freely amalgamate on a basis of democratic
centralism into a single federal union as represented by the Soviet state
power of the Russian Soviet Republic; 

that the Soviets concentrate in their hands not only the legislative
power and supervision of law enforcement, but direct enforcement of the
laws through all the members of the Soviets with a view to a gradual
transition to the performance of legislative functions and state
administration by the whole working population. 

Taking, further, into consideration, 

that any direct or indirect legalisation of the rights of ownership of
the workers of any given factory or any given trade on their particular
production, or of their right to weaken or impede the orders of the state
authority, is

    

a flagrant distortion of the basic principles of Soviet power and a
complete rejection of

    socialism....[1]

Your correspondent talked today with Lenin concerning the
situation in Russia and the general situation in Europe. Lenin emphasised
that a revolution is always born in travail. A country making a revolution
on its own will always find itself in a serious position. But the situation
is difficult everywhere, not only in Russia. There is said to be anarchy in
Russia, but that is the fruit of four years of war, and not of the
Bolshevik regime. The few remaining weeks until the new harvest will be the
most difficult. The harvest promises to be a good one. The
counter-revolution is trying its hardest to take advantage of the present
situation. The counter-revolution consists of rich peasants and officers,
but without foreign support they are powerless. In the towns where the
counter-revolutionaries had won, they remained in power only a few days, if
not a few hours. The assassination of Volodarsky, organised by the Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries, really reveals the weakness of the
counter-revolutionaries. The history of the Russian revolution shows that a
party always resorts to individual terror when it does not enjoy the
support of the masses. 
 *     *  * 

Opposition within the Bolshevik Party against the peace of Brest has
subsided, says Lenin. Bukharin, Radek and the rest are taking part in the
work again. Peace is necessary

    

in order to prevent the Germans from seizing the whole of Russia and
strangling the revolution. As regards the measures taken against the
anarchists, these are due to the fact that the anarchists had been arming
and some of them had been joining up with patently bandit elements. The
anarchists who are dedicated to an ideal have already been released and
their big daily Anarkhia is coming out as

usual.[2] 

Amid all these difficulties, industry is being organised. The owners of
the enterprises are still sabotaging on a broad scale, but the workers are
taking the management of the enterprises into their own hands. 

Referring to the Czechoslovak revolt, Lenin expressed confidence that
it would be suppressed by the Soviet troops, although it was dragging
out. 
 *     *  * 

The Germans in the Ukraine are in a very difficult plight. They are
receiving no grain whatever from the peasants. The peasants are arming and
attacking the German soldiers in large groups wherever they are met
with. This movement is spreading. Owing to the German occupation Bolshevism
in the Ukraine has become a sort of national movement. It is rallying
around it people who would not hear of Bolshevism before that. If the
Germans occupied Russia, the result would be the same. The Germans need
peace. It is significant that in the Ukraine the Germans want peace more
than the Ukrainians themselves do. The same applies to Turkey. The Germans
have concluded an advantageous agreement with the Ukrainian Rada despite
the fact that people in the Ukraine have always criticised the peace of
Brest. Now the Germans are helping to fight the Bolsheviks in the
Caucasus. 
 *     *  * 

We in Russia now have to wait for the revolutionary movement to develop
in Europe. The war party in Germany today is so strong that it speaks with
contempt of the government in Berlin. Resistance to imperialism, however,
is growing even in bourgeois circles. Sooner or later things

    

everywhere will lead to political and social collapse. The present
situation is unstable, but a better order of things cannot be created
merely with the aid of war and bloodshed. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The interview with Lenin was reported to the newspaper the same day by
a special telegram, but for technical reasons it was received late and was
not published until July 4, 1918. Following this, a summary of the
interview was published on July 6 in Leipziger Volkszeitung
No. 155. 

Folkets Dagblad  Politiken—newspaper of the Swedish Left
Social-Democrats, was published in Stockholm from April 1916 (up to
November 1917 it was called Politiken).  In 1921 it became the
organ of the Communist Party of Sweden; after the split in the party in
October 1929 the newspaper passed into the hands of the party’s Right
wing. Publication ceased in May 1945. 



[2]
This refers to the disarming of the anarchists by the security forces
in Moscow on the night of April 12, 1918. This measure was necessitated by
the fact that the various groups of anarchists served as a screen for
counter-revolutionary and criminal elements who terrorised the population
by their raids and robberies and took refuge in the villas which the
anarchists had seized. The anarchists in Petrograd, who failed to comply
with the demand for the surrender of firearms, were disarmed on April 23,
1918. 

Anarkhia (Anarchy)—an anarchist literary and socio-economic
newspaper published in Moscow from September 1917 to July 1918; by order of
the Vecheka it was closed down on April 43; publication was resumed on
April 21, 1918.

(Lenin’s appearance was greeted with a prolonged
standing ovation. The “Internationale” was sung.)

In his speech Lenin, in a clear and popular form, explained the essential
features and basic points of the Soviet Constitution. The Soviets were the
highest form of democratic government by the people. The Soviets were not
something invented out of one’s head, they were the product of living
reality. They

    

appeared and developed for the first time in history in our backward
country, but objectively they should become the form of government by the
working people all over the world. 

All constitutions that had existed till now safeguarded the interests
of the ruling classes. The Soviet Constitution was the only one that served
and would constantly serve the working people and was a powerful weapon in
the fight for socialism. Comrade Lenin very aptly pointed out the
differences between the demands for “freedom of the press and assembly”
in bourgeois constitutions and in the Soviet Constitution. There, freedom
of the press and assembly was an exclusive monopoly of the bourgeoisie
there the bourgeoisie met in their saloons, issued their big dailies
financed by the banks with the aim of sowing lies and slander and poisoning
the minds of the masses; there the workers’ press was strangled, not
allowed to say what it thought about the predatory war; there, those
opposed to the war were hounded and their meetings banned. Here in Soviet
Russia, however, the workers’ press existed and served the working
people. In Russia we were taking the sumptuous houses and palaces away from
the bourgeoisie and turning them over to the workers to be used by them as
clubs, and that was freedom of assembly in practice. Religion was a private
concern. Everyone could believe in what he wants or believe in nothing. The
Soviet Republic united the working people of all nations and defended the
interests o the working people without national discrimination. The Soviet
Republic knew no religious distinctions. It stood above all religion and
strove to separate religion from the Soviet state. Lenin went on to
describe the Soviet Republic’s difficult position, surrounded as it was on
all sides by imperialist predators. Comrade Lenin expressed his confidence
that the Red Army men would defend our Soviet Republic with all their might
against all encroachments by international imperialism and would keep it
safe until our ally-the international proletariat-came to our aid.

(Comrade Lenin’s speech was greeted with prolonged and tumultuous
applause. The “Internationale” was sung.) 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin addressed a meeting in the large hail of the Racing Society at
Khodynka on the evening of July 26, 1918. The hall was crowded to
overflowing with workers and Red Army men. A soldier made a speech on
behalf of the First Reserve Artillery Brigade in which he said that in the
person of Lenin they greeted the Council of People’s Commissars and were
ready to defend the workers’ and peasants’ government at the Council’s
first call. The resolution proposed after Lenin’s speech was adopted
unanimously with one abstention. In conclusion Zriamensky briefly
acquainted the audience with Lenin’s biography.

Ought we not add?


let the Committees of Poor Peasants
confiscate  seed grain from the kulaks, and in any case, if
confiscation is now impossible, the rich farmers should subsequently be
made to supply the seeds that will temporarily be taken for the poor out of
the grain stocks of the former landed

estates.{1}

 resistance. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of introducing a tax in kind was raised by Lenin in his
“Theses on the Food Question” written on August 2, 1918 (see present
edition, Vol. 28, pp. 45-47). The draft decree for imposing a tax in kind
on the farmers was first introduced at a meeting of the C.P.C. on September
4. It was discussed again at a meeting of the C.P.C. on September 21. It
was probably during these meetings of the Council that Lenin jotted down
his “Main Provisions of the Decree” and his remarks on the draft. (For
Lenin’s documents connected with the drafting of the decree at this and
other meetings of the Council of People’s Commissarsnotes, calculations,
plan of a speech at the Council meetingsee also Lenin Miscellany X
VIII, pp. 148-50.) The decree in its final form was adopted by the
C.P.C. on October 26, endorsedby the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
on October 30 and published in Izvestia on November 14, 1918. The
extension of foreign military intervention and the civil war prevented this
measure from being implemented. 

Lenin’s principles for an income tax in kind drafted in
’1918 were elaborated and embodied in the food tax in the spring of 1921,
which marked the postwar transition to peaceful economic construction on
the basis of the New Economic Policy. The decree on the tax in kind adopted
in October 1918 was mentioned by Lenin in his report on the political work
of the C.C. at the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), when dealing with the
question of replacing the surplus-appropriation system by a food tax (see
present edition, Vol. 32, p. 187) 



[2]
Article 12 of the “Basic Law on the Socialisation of the Land’
endorsed by the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets on January 18 (31),
1918, and adopted at the session of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee on January 27 (February 9) runs as follows: “The distribution of
land among the working people shall be carried out on an equalised labour
basis in such a manner that the subsistence and labour norm adapted in the
given area to the historically established system of land tenure should not
exceed the available manpower on each individual farm and at the same time
should allow the farmer’s family to make a fairly comfortable living.”
Article 17 of the Law says: “The surplus income derived from naturally
fertile superior plots as well as from their more advantageous location for
marketing, shall be placed at the disposal of the Soviet authorities to be
used for public needs” (Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. I,
Moscow, 1957, pp. 408-09).

Notes
 
 



[1]
At a meeting of the C.P.C. on October 15, 1918, the People’s
Commissariat for Food tabled a proposal that 40 million rubles be allocated
for the upkeep of the Poor Peasants’ Committees, apparently for a period of
six months at the rate of 6.5 million rubles per month. In view of the
impending amalgamation of these committees with the local Soviets, Lenin
proposed a 2-month allocation of funds (”2 >< 6½=13”). The
C.P.C. adopted Lenin’s proposal for the allocation of 13 million rubles;
the other proposals of Lenin’s were also included in the decision of the
C.P.C. (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. III, Moscow,
1964,pp. 593-95).

This was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion by the
C.P.C. of the report of the Board of Three on logging under the Supreme
Economic Council. All Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision
adopted by the C.P.C. on this question. The latter allocated 100 million
rubles for logging operations, demanded an account of their expenditure
within a week and ordered the Board of Three, within the same period, to
submit more concrete information on the questions formulated by Lenin.

I. Legality must be raised (or rigorously observed), since
the basis of laws in the R.S.F.S.R. has been established. 

II. Emergency measures of war/are against counter-revolution should not
be restricted by the laws, provided: 

(α) that an exact and formal statement be made by the appropriate
Soviet body or official to the effect that the special conditions of civil
war and the fight against counter-revolution require that the limits of the
law be exceeded; 

(β) that such a statement in writing be forwarded immediately to
the C.P.C. and copies sent to the local authorities concerned. 

III. In all conflicts, friction, misunderstandings or disputes as to
the limits of jurisdiction, etc., between officials or Soviet government
bodies-all such persons and bodies are obliged immediately to draw up the
briefest of reports giving the date, place, and names of the officials or
bodies and the bare gist of the matter (without details). A copy of the
report must be handed to the other party. 

IV. Similar brief reports shall be drawn up by every official or Soviet
body in the event of any citizen of the Republic complaining against any
measure (or red tape,etc.) on the part of the said official or body. A copy
must be sent to the citizen lodging the complaint, and another to the body
higher up. 

V. Anyone making patently groundless statements in the report
tantamount to gross abuse shall be liable to prosecution. 

VI, Refusal to hand over a report with the clearly written name of the
official is a criminal breach of trust. 
 

I propose that the C.C. approve in principle and instruct the People’s
Commissariat for Justice to word this as a

decree.[1]

On November 8, 1918, the Extraordinary Sixth All-Russia Con- gress of
Soviets, on the report of People’s Commissar for Justice D. I. Kursky,
passed a decision on revolutionary legality based on Lenin’s theses, which
were approved by the Party’s Central Committee. The decision was published
in Pravda on November 10.

Notes
 
 



{1}

On June 5, 1918, Izvestia published a decree of the
C.P.C. placing the educational institutions and establishments of all
departments under the jurisdiction of the People’s Commissariat for
Education. On November 19, 1918, the People’s Commissariat for Social
Security submitted to the C.P.C. (the question was reported by
A. I. Ulyanova-Yeizarova) a draft decree leaving the children’s homes under
the jurisdiction of this commissariat. It was in connection with this
discussion that Lenin wrote his draft decision, which was adopted with
slight changes. 



{2}

§ 3 of the C.P.C. ’s Decree of June 5, 1918, ordered the People’s
Commissariat for Education to form special commissions of representatives
of the departments concerned and of the Commissariat for Education to make
arrangements for the turnover of the educational institutions and
establishments, including the institutions of pre-school education.

e) Co-operative warehouses and shops are not subject to

  municipalisation.[1]

 


In places where co-operatives were nationalised or municipalised and
   stocks of goods in co-operative stores requisitioned or confiscated by the
   local Soviet authorities before publication of this decree, all such
   co-operatives shall be re-established, their stocks returned to them, the
   missing goods accounted for and no further obstructions raised to their
   legitimate activities. 


Note: 

In restoring the co-operatives measures must be taken to prevent
counter-revolutionary or kulak distortion of their activities and to have
strict and absolute control over them exercised by the Poor Peasants’
Committees and the local

Soviets.[2] 
 

Notes
 

[1]
The text of the adopted decree reads
“nationalisation”.—Ed. 
 



[2]
The draft decree on the organisation of supply for the population was
discussed at a meeting of the C.P.C. on November 12, 1918, and finally
endorsed by the C.P.C. on November 21. Lenin’s addenda were included in the
adopted text of the decree, which was published in IzvesUa on November
24. 

The question of the co-operatives’ participation in the
organisation of supply for the population as dealt with in the draft decree
with Lenin’s addenda to it, was misunderstood by some of the leading food
supply workers. Lenin clarified this question in a speech delivered at a
meeting of delegates from the Moscow Central Workers’ Co-operative on
November 26, 1918, in a report on the attitude of the proletariat to
petty-bourgeois democrats made at a Moscow Party workers’ meeting on
November 27, and in his reply to the discussion (see present edition,
Vol. 28, pp. 196-200, 213-16, 221-24).

The Council of Defence (Council of Workers and Peasants’
Defence) was set up by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on
November 30, 1918, as a special organ of the Soviet state vested with full
powers in the matter of mobilising the country’s forcÇes and resources
in the interests of defence. Lenin was appointed Chairman of the Council of
Defence. 

The documents published here were written by Lenin at
the first meeting of the Council of Defence on December 1, 1918. First
Lenin outlined the immeÇdiate tasks of the Council and the agenda for
its first sitting (Document 1). Then he jotted down a number of proposals
for elaborating these questions, formulating more detailed proposals on the
food question (Documents 2 and 3). Lenin’s proposals were reflected in the
decisions of the Council of Defence adopted at its sitting (see Lenin
Miscellany XVIII, pp. 243-45). 



[3]
On Point 4 of the agenda (”On the Mobilisation of
Intellectuals”)L. B.  Krasin was instructed to draw up a draft decision
for themobilisation of technical personnel; L. B. Krasin, V. I. Nevskyand
N. P. Gorbunov were instructed to draw up draft regulationson
questionnaires to be submitted to the C.P.C. 



[4]
The Council of Defence passed a decision for the fuel question to be
considered by a special five-man commission, which was to be summoned by
Lenin. The commission met on December 2,1918 (see the next document).

[1]
This draft was written by Lenin apparently at a meeting of the Fuel
Commission set up by the Council of Defence (see previous Note). It took
into account the opinions expressed by the commission members. Lenin’s
draft was adopted by the commission and included in its minutes. In the
Minutes of the Fuel Commission points 1, 2, 3, 4 are given under a special
heading “Decisions of the Commission Having the Force of Defence Council
Decisions”. Lenin’s draft, endorsed as a decision, was signed also by
Defence Council members J. V. Stalin and V. I. Nevsky.

The State Bank held up the issue of currency notes from the special
fund reserved to the Chief Timber Board.

The Vecheka department dealing with complaints and requests to expedite
cases should be expanded immediately. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

In the course of a discussion of the work of the railways at a meeting
of the Council of Defence on December 1, 1918, a commission was set up to
deal with questions relating to the activities of the transport department
of the Vecheka. The commission, chaired by Lenin, held its first meeting on
December 3. This rough draft was probably made by Lenin during the
meeting. All points of these proposdis with the exception of the two last
paragraphs were later crossed out by Lenin. The commission’s decisions were
formulated on the basis of Lenin’s proposals. 



{2}

This refers to the leadership of the boards of the gubernia and railway
Chekas. 



{3}

On the basis of Lenin’s proposals the commission decided to instruct
the People’s Commissariat for Railways together with a representative of
the Vecheka to revise the regulations governing the Transport Department of
the Vecheka in respect of non-interference by the Vecheka in the
commissariat’s technical and management functions. On the question of the
relationships between the Vecheka, the Railway Cheka (Transport Department
of the Vecheka) and the Commissariat for Railways see the draft decision of
the Council of Defence (pp. 127-29 of this volume).  



{4}

By decision of the commission the right to participate in judicial
investigations through their delegates was granted to the People’s
Commissariats and the Party Committees of the R.C.P.(B.).

Draft Decision Of The C.P.C. 
Systematically

1) check concrete cases of urgent execution of definite,
clearly defined tasks of the Food Commissariat and food organisations; 

2) establish contact with workers and working masses and
systematically enlist their co-operation in the work of delivering and
distributing foodstuffs, first as witnesses, then as members of the
inspection; 

3) oblige all bodies of the workers’ inspection to give
weekly reports of their activities to the local and central trade union
bodies;

Remarks on the Draft “Regulations”

This draft to be revised in the direction of (1) making it the fixed
definite task of the Workers’ Food Inspection not only to examine the
business correspondence of the food

    

supply organisations, but chiefly to verify concrete instances of their
activities in connection with the purveyance, delivery and distribution of
food products; 

—further (2) obliging the Workers’ Food Inspection to establish
contact between the food policy and the workers and working masses and
enlist their services, one and all (through the participation of witnesses
as a first step), to the business of food administration. 

(3)—making it the duty of the Workers’ Food Inspection to report
weekly to the broad mass of the working class and the working population
primarily through the trade unions.

The draft Regulations introduced by N. P. Bryukhanov were discussed at
the meeting of the C.P.C. on December 5, 1918. Lenin’s draft decision and
remarks in this connection were apparently jotted down during the
discussion, but were then crossed out by him. However, the amendments
adopted at the meeting and incorporated in the draft Regulations coincide
with his drafts.

matter. The commission on cartridges met on December 5 and was attended y
V. I. Lenin, L. B.Krasin (Chairman of the Extraordinary Commission on Red
Army Supply), E. M. Sklyansky (Vice-Chairman of the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic), Commander-in- Chief I. I. Vatsetis, and
representatives of the Chief Artillery Board, the Tula Cartridge Factory
and others-altogether 17 people. The commission passed decisions having the
force of Defence Council decisions; they were based on the measures

Its This document was written by Lenin in connection with the
discussion of V. P. Milyutin’s report concerning the financing of
Centrotxtil (Central Committee of the Textile Industry under the S.E.C.) at
a meeting of the C.P.C. on December 14, 1918. Lenin’s proposals were
reflected in the decision which the C.P.C. adopted in this. connection.




[2]
Points 1 and 3 were crossed out by Lenin. A comparison with the text of
the decision as recorded in the minutes gives grounds for presuming that
Lenin did not cross out the points which were accepted by the C.P.C.

Comrade Chicherin, 
|| 

We must urgently (to be endorsed in the C.C. before departure
of the

Spartacist{4}) prepare an international socialist conference for
founding the Third International. (in Berlin (openly) or in Holland
(secretly), say, for 1.11.1 9 1 9)

 | | |


[generally very soon] 

For this we must 
(a) formulate platform principles (I think we
could


 (α) take the theory and practice of Bolshevism—have
Bukharin set this forth in theses, as briefly as possible.

    

Talk it over with Bukharin—perhaps take part of them from my draft

      programme{1}

 (β) then take “Was will der Spartacusbund?"). α +
β give sufficiently clear platform principles; 



(b) define the basis (organisational) of the
Third International (nothing in common with the social-patriots);

(c) give a list of parties, roughly under three headings


 αα) parties and groups we have good reason to consider as
already sharing the platform of the Third International and as being
sufficiently unanimous oil the question of formally founding the
Third International; 
 ββ) parties close to this, from whom we
expect alignment and affiliation; 
 γγ) groups and currents within the
 social-patriotic parties more or less close to Bolshevism. 


I am offering a tentative list

       (p. 4){2}

;

additions should be made with care. 

Who are we inviting to our conference? Only αα +
ββ + γγ and only those

(1) who resolutely stand for a break with the social-patriots (i.e., the
people who, directly or indirectly, supported the bourgeois governments
during the imperialist war of 1914-18);

2) who are for a socialist revolution now and
 f o r  the dictatorship of the proletariat;

3) who are in principle for “Soviet power" and against
limitation of our work by bourgeois parliamentarism, against
subordination to it, and who recognise the fact that the Soviet
type of government is higher and closer to
socialism. 
Perhaps we should add that we do not suggest that the whole of
the Third International immediately start calling itself “communist”, but
we

do place on the order of the day (for discussion) the
question of resolutely rejecting the names of
“Social-Democratic”and “socialist”parties, and adopting that of
“communist” parties.

only briefly.

Notes

Lenin is referring to the material for the draft of the Party’s new
programme (see Vol. 24, pp. 455-79 and Vol. 27, pp. 152–58 of this
edition).—Ed. 

{2}

The list is given at the end of this letter—Ed. 
 



{3}

Lenin’s letter to Chicherin was written in connection with the
preparations for the first congress of the Comintern. 

Already at the beginning of the first world war, when
the collapse of the Second International occurred as a result of most of
the leaders of the socialist parties in the West adopting a
social-chauvinist stand, Lenin put forward the idea of founding a new,
truly revolutionary International and pressed forward with a campaign to
unite the Left socialist forces in the international labour movement. The
victory of the October Socialist Revolution and its growing impact upon the
international revolutionary movement, and the emergence of Communist
Parties or groups in a number of capitalist countries made this task more
urgent than ever and created favourable conditions for its solution. 

The urgent need for uniting the Communists was further
dictated by the fact that the opportunist, social-chauvinist leaders had
made an attempt to revive the Second International. The leadership of the
British Labour Party had addressed a proposal to the socialists of all
countries to convene in Lausanne on January 6, 1949, an international
socialist conference to rehabilitate the Second International. In reply to
this proposal the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party
(Bolsheviks) circulated on December 24, 1918, a radio-telegram calling on
all revolutionary internationalist elements to refuse to take part “in
conferences of enemies of the working class wearing the mask of
socialism”(Pravda No. 281, December 25, 1918). At the sametime
Lenin, as his letter to Chicherin shows, raised the question of convening
without delay an international conference of Communists and Left
Social-Democrats with the aim of founding the Third
International. p. —Ed. 



{4}

This refers to E. Fuchs, a member of the Central Council of the
Sportakusbund. He arrived in Moscow from Berlin at the end of
December 1918 to inform Lenin of the situation in Germany. 



{5}

A report was drawn up for Lenin on December 31 characterising the
parties and organisations mentioned in his list In addition to those
given by Lenin the report gave the names of eight more organisations. It
also suggested inviting representatives of the Chinese, Korean and
Persian revolutionary workers to the conference in the capacity of
guests. 

The same day Lenin received the draft of an appeal “To the First
Congress of the Communist International”written at his request and in
keeping with his proposals. Lenin made a number of important amendments
to the draft. 

In January 1919 the draft appeal “To the First
Congress of the Communist International”was submitted by Lenin at ameeting
of representatives of a number of communist and socialist parties and
organisations. After a discussion, the meeting adopted the draft. The
appeal was published in the press on January 24, 1918. 

The First Congress of the Communist International was
held on March 2-6, 1919 (see present edition, Vol. 28,
pp. 453-77).—Ed.

Assignment: a reading book for workers and peasants to be
compiled within a fortnight. 

The book to consist of separate, complete, independent leaflets of two
to four printed pages. 

Wording must be very popular, designed for the ignorant peasant. Number
of leaflets from 50 to 200; for the first issue -50. 

Subjects: organisation of Soviet power, its home and foreign
policies. For example: What is Soviet power? How to run the country. The
law on land. The economic councils. Nationalisation of the
factories. Labour discipline. Imperialism. The imperialist war. Secret
treaties. How we offered peace. What we are fighting for now. What is
communism? Separation of the church from the state. And so on. 

Good old texts can and should be used, and old articles rewritten. 

The reading book should provide material for public readings and home
reading, for reprinting of separate texts and for translation (with slight
additions) into other languages.

 I. Collect information on the actual implementation by the
   co-operatives of the basic line of Soviet policy, namely:

      
 (1) not only co-operative organisation of the whole
         population, but the predominant role of the proletarian and
         semi-proletarian population in co-operative activities. 
 (2) such a system of supply and distribution as would really
         enable the poor (= proletarians + semi-proletarians) to derive
         benefit (goods, etc.) from the delivery of all surpluses of grain
         to the state. 



   ad

      
 1 direct the Co-operative Department of the Supreme Economic
         Council and the Commissariat for Food, together with the Central
         Statistical Board to collect this information. Report in a
         fortnight. 


 II. Direct the Food Commissariat to draw up instructions concerning
   Soviet agents in the co-operatives and develop propaganda and organising
   work to this end. 
 III. Direct the workers’ co-operatives to elect a majority of their
   own representatives to the Board of Centrosoyuz and make it possible to
   introduce Communists there experienced in practical work. 
 IV. Krestinsky—draft decree on consumers’ communes. 

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was introduced by Lenin and adopted with slight amendments
at a meeting of the C.P.C. on January 28, 1919. 

The draft decree on consumers’ communes mentioned in
Point 4 was adopted by the C.P.C. on March 16 and published in Izvestia
No. 60 on March 20. 

Lenin’s addendum to Point I was written in the margin
probably after the writing of the draft decision as a whole. The beginning
of Point I of the C.P.C.’s decision of January 28 was worded as follows:
“Direct the Co-operative Department of the S.E.C. and the People’s
Commissariat for Food together with the Central Statistical Board to
collect within the shortest possible time information concerning the actual
implementation by the co-operatives of the basic line of Soviet
policy”.

implementation a practical necessity; 

4) to speed up a practical and final decision on this
question, its sponsors to be asked to produce evidence of their declared
contacts with solid capitalist firms capable of handling this job and
shipping the materials; 

5) an ad hoc commission to be directed to submit a final
draft contract within a fortnight; 

6) the Military Commissariat to be instructed within a

view. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The question of granting a concession to build the Great Northern
Railway was discussed at a meeting of the C.P.C. on February 4, 1919. The
Council adopted Lenin’s motion with certain amendments. 

According to the project of the concession’s sponsors
the new line was to link the Oh with Petrograd and Murmank via Kotlas. No
contract for this railway was concluded.

In issuing this directive, the C.C., R.C.P. proposes that
the following established principle be adhered to: from the poor
peasants—nothing, the middle peasants—moderately, the rich
peasants—heavily. 
 

We advise fixing the maximum surplus, for example, 500 million
poods for the whole of the Ukraine, of which one-fifth or one-tenth share
be assessed for requisitioning.

We seldom have a chance now of receiving foreign newspapers
in Russia: the blockade with which the “democratic capitalists” of the
Entente have surrounded us is apparently operating effectively. They are
afraid to acquaint the educated workers of America, Britain and France with
ignorant and uncivilised Bolshevism, they are afraid lest people in this
land of uncivilised Bolshevism get to know of its successes in the
West. 

But despite the zealous efforts of the gendarmery of the new Holy
Alliance to suppress it, the truth will out! 

The other day I happened to see several numbers of the Berlin newspaper
Die Freiheit, the organ of the so-called “independent” German
Social-Democrats. The front page of No. 74 (for 11.11.1919) carried a
lengthy appeal “To the Revolutionary Proletariat of Germany” signed by
the Central Committee of the party and its parliamentary group. The ideas,
or rather the lack of ideas, underlying this appeal are so characteristic
of not only the German, but of the world’s labour movement, that they
deserve to be dwelt upon. 

But first I should like to make a digression connected with personal
reminiscences. Among the signatures of the parliamentary group of
Independents I came across the names of Seger and Laukant, and they
reminded me of what happened three years ago. I had occasion to meet
Laukant at a meeting of the Zimmerwaldists in

Berne.[4] This seemingly influential Berlin worker produced a dual
impression: on the one hand, serious revolutionary work among the masses,
on the other, an astonishing lack of

    

     theoretical[1]

and appalling short-sightedness. Laukant did not like my sharp attacks on
Kautsky (the ideological “leader” of the Independents, or rather leader
of their non-ideology), but he did not refuse to help me when, doubtful of
my unreliable German, I showed him the text of a short speech in German I
had

      written,[2]

in which I quoted the statement of the “American Bebel”, Eugene Debs, to
the effect that he would rather be shot than agree to vote for imperialist
war loans, and that he would agree to fight only in a war of the workers
against the capitalists. On the other hand, when, with furious indignation,
I showed Laukant the passage from Kautsky’s article in which that gentleman
denounced the workers’ street demonstrations as

adventurism[5] (and that under Wilhelm II) Laukant shrugged his
shoulders and answered with exasperating coolness: “Our workers don’t read
this as attentively as all that! I’m not obliged to agree with every line
of Kautsky’s, am I?” 
 

Notes
 

[1]
Apparently the word “interests” or “knowledge” has been omitted in
the manuscript.  —Lenin

[2]
See Volume 22 of this edition, pp. 125-26. —Lenin
 



[3]
Lenin’s unfinished article “On the Appeal of the German Independents”
was written in the latter part of February 1919. 

The appeal is criticised in § 21 of Lenin’s theses
on bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat (see present
edition, Volume 28,

p. 467).




[4]
Lenin is referring to the meeting of the enlarged International
Socialist Commission (Internationale Sozialistische Kommission)
held in Berne on February 5-9, 1916. It was attended by 22 delegates from
the internationalists of a number of countries: Germany, Russia, Italy,
Norway, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Rumania. Lenin took an
active part in the proceedings. The meeting adopted an appeal ’To All
Affiliated Parties and Groups” denouncing the participation of socialists
in bourgeois governments, the slogan of “Defence of the fatherland” in
the imperialist war, and voting for war loans; it pointed to the necessity
of supporting the labour movement and preparing mass revolutionary action
against the imperialist war. The appeal, however, suffered from
inconsistency in that it failed to demand a break with social-chauvinism
and opportunism. In voting for the text of the appeal, the members of the
Zimmerwald Left declared at the meeting that although they did not consider
all its points satisfactory, they were voting for it because they regarded
it as a step forward in comparison with the decisions of the First
International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald. The meeting fixed the
date for convening a second international socialist conference. 



[5]
The reference is to Kautsky’s article Fraktton und Partei
published in Die Neue Zeit  No. 9 for November 26, 1915

28.II.1919

In order to regulate relations between the Vecheka, the Railway Cheka
and the Commissariat for Railways the following provisions are laid down:

 

Comrade Belyakov, from the Commissariat for Railways, to be delegated
to the Transport Department of the Vecheka for permanent liaison and
work. 

The Commissariat for Railways to issue orders down the line that all
complaints against the Cheka be addressed exclusively to C.R. Board member
Belyakov. 

The Cheka to be charged with supervising timely unloading of freights
by the organisations and bodies concerned, and in the event of unloading
work not being fulfilled in the time set by the Cheka, the guilty parties
are to be called to account. 

Local sections of the Railway Cheka to be given the right to use the
railway telegraph (for payment) and made to bear strict responsibility for
using it without need. Detailed instructions on the use of the telegraph
and method of payment to be issued by the People’s Commissar for Railways
and the Chairman of the Vecheka by agreement. 

The former premises of the railway police to be turned over to the
Railway Cheka, and a special order to this effect to be issued by the
C.R. Comrades Dzerzhinsky and Sklyansky to issue joint instructions
concerning the eviction of military guards from these premises. 

Food rations to be issued in the usual way to the Railway Cheka from
the supplies of the railway food organisations. 

So long as martial law introduced on the railways by the Council of
Defence continues, the district transport departments of the Cheka are to
be given the right to apply capital punishment to persons found guilty of
bribery, theft of freights and railway material, and systematic abuse on
the part of officials. 
To Members of the Council of Defence
28.11.1919

The points I propose have been approved at a meeting I had with
Comrades Nevsky and Dzerzhinsky on 28/11. 

Please have them signed by all the members of the Council of Defence,
so that this extremely important


agreement may be put into effect
immediately. 
 

In the event of serious differences please send me the text
of amendments at once by phoned telegram. 

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
Chairman, Council of Defence

Comrade Lenin began his speech by quoting the closing
passage of the women students’ letter and said that they should keep their
word and create a strong army of the home

front.{1} It was only with the help of the woman, her thoughtfulness
and social awareness, that the new society could be consolidated. It was
the lack of this social awareness among the mass of the women, he said,
that had acted as a brake in previous revolutions. 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The women attending the courses wrote a letter to Lenin asking him to
address their meeting. They concluded their letter with a pledge to take
the places of their husbands, brothers and sons who had joined the Red
Army.

Should not § 1 be thrown out? 

Notes to § 2 and § 3 to be removed. 

Not less than two-thirds of the membership of every
co-operative should belong to the proletariat or semi-proletariat (i.e., to
persons living solely or to the extent of not less than 50 per cent by the
sale of their labour power). 

Agencies of the workers’ co-operatives send commissars
to the co-operatives having over ten per cent of their members belonging to
the propertied classes. The commissars have the right of supervision and
control, as well as the right of veto, decisions thus vetoed being
submitted for final settlement to the agencies of the S.E.C. 

||

What form of expression may practical co-operation of
the commercial and industrial employees’ unions take? 

||

What about introducing a number of substantial bonuses
and benefits for co-operatives that have embraced the whole population?


Municipalities uniting the whole population around
municipal shops.

In view of the extreme danger threatening the Republic as a
result of the aggravation of the food and transport crises, the C.C.,
R.C.P. resolves: 

to charge Comrades Kamenev

       Zinoviev

       and Stalin


with organising groups of influential workers and forming trains by
arrangement with the People’s Commissariats for Food and Railways as well
as with the Central Executive Committee, and sending them out on food
transportation

jobs.[1] 
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The need for sending the best workers out on food and transportation
jobs had been dealt with by Lenin in his speech at a joint session of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet and the
All-Russia Trade Union Congress on January 17, 1919 (see present edition,
Vol. 28, pp. 403-04).  Lenin’s draft was adopted by the C.C. of the
R.C.P.(B.); it was signed also by C. C. members L. B. Kamenev,
G. Y. Zinoviev, J. V. Stalin, Y. D. Stasova, N. N Krestinsky,
M. F. Vladimirsky, N. I. Bukharin, V. V. Schmidt and F E. Dzerzhinsky.

The Commissariat for Railways makes known to the workers
that receipt of 25 pounds, according to exact calculations, is fully
guaranteed in the event of six million poods a month being
transported. Much more than this can be transported. A strong effort must
be made to increase the number of locomotives repaired. Over and above this
bonuses will be issued for increased labour productivity in accordance
with norms laid down by the All-Russia Trade Union Council.

This meeting of representatives of the working class and
peasantry of the R.S.F.S.R. declares that the Soviet Republic has entered
it most difficult month. The Allies are making their last desperate effort
to crush us by force of arms. The food situation in the spring is the most
difficult. The transport system is utterly disrupted. 

Only the greatest effort can save us. Victory is possible. The
revolution in Hungary has proved conclusively that the Soviet movement in
Western Europe is growing and its victory is not far off. We have many
allies all over the world, more than we imagine. We must hold on for
another four or five difficult months in order to beat our enemies. 

This meeting harshly condemns the Left

      Socialist-Revolutionaries,{1}

the Mensheviks and the Right S.R.s who, while paying lip-service to Soviet
power or protesting in word against the armed intervention of the Allies,
are in fact helping the whiteguards when they agitate for strikes or for
cessation of the civil war (although we offered peace to

all!{3}) or for concessions to freedom of trade, and so on. 

This meeting declares that all those Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries who are prepared to help us in our difficult
struggle shall be ensured full liberty as citizens of the Soviet
Republic. 

This meeting, however, declares relentless war upon those Mensheviks
and Socialist-Revolutionaries who, like the literary and political groups
Vsegda

Vperyod!{4} and

    

Dyelo

Naroda,{5} are actually impeding our struggle, actually assisting
the whiteguards. 

This meeting calls upon all workers, all workers渹 organisations
and all working peasants to exert every effort to repel the enemies of
Soviet power, to defend that power and improve the food supply and
transport systems. 

1. To enlist members of the middle section-i.e., people who are less
experienced than the advanced workers and peasants-to replace the
overworked advanced section. 

2. To send more and more contingents of the advanced and rank-and-file
workers out on food supply, transport and army work. 

3. To enlist the largest possible number of politically conscious
workers and peasants for work at the People渹s Commissariat for
Railways and the State Control, in order to improve the functioning of
these bodies and to eliminate bureaucracy and red tape. 

4. To transfer as many people as possible from the starving cities to
agricultural work, to vegetable gardening, to the rural districts, to the
Ukraine, to the Don region, and so forth, in order to increase grain
production. 

All efforts to be exerted to assist the middle peasants, to put a stop
to the abuses from which they so often suffer, and to render them comradely
help. Those Soviet officials who refuse to carry out this policy-which is
the only correct one-or who fail to understand it, must be immediately
dismissed, 

5. To combat all signs of weariness, faint-heartedness and vacillation,
to enhearten in every way those who show such signs, strengthen their
spirit, consciousness and comradely discipline. The working class and the
peasantry of Russia have borne incredible burdens. The last few months have
been incredibly difficult. But this meeting declares that the workers have
not lost heart, that the working class remains at its post;, that it will
overcome all difficulties and maintain at all costs the victory of the
Soviet Socialist Republic in Russia and throughout the world.

The Extraordinary Plenary Meeting of the Moscow Soviet of April l3,
1919,  was held jointly with representatives of the district Soviets,
factory committees and trade union executives in connection with the
aggravation of the food situation in Moscow and the consequent agitation
carried on among the railwaymen by the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries. The latter called upon the railwaymen to strike
and sabotage work in the railway repair shops. This counter-revolutionary
agitation led to a strike in the shops of the: Alexandrovsky Railway, as a
result of which the central workshops were closed on March 31 by order of
the People’s Commissariat for Railways and work in them was not resumed
until April 3, after the kulak elements had been dismissed.  

Lenin made a report at the meeting on the domestic and
foreign situation of the Soviet Republic. A report on the state of railway
transport was made by L. B. Krasin, and on the food policy by
A. I. Svidersky. Speakers in the debate denounced the counter-revolutionary
agitation of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. In winding up
the debate, A. V. Lunacharsky moved the resolution on the domestic and
foreign situation of the Soviet Republic drafted by Lenin. This volume
contains the original version of this draft resolution. The meeting of the
Moscow Soviet also adopted a special resolution branding the
counter-revolutionary agitation and approving the measures taken by the
Commissariat for Railways in regard to the Aleiandrovsky railway shops.


For Lenin’s report and resolution see present edition,
Vol. 29 pp. 255-74.

In January 1919 the Soviet Government made two offers of peace (on the
12th and 17th). On February 4 it notified the Governments of Great Britain,
France, Italy, Japan and the U.S.A. by radio that it was ready to attend
the proposed peace conference on Princes Islands.

Dyslo Naroda (People’s Cause)—organ of the S.R. Party,
published in Petrograd, then at intervals in Samara and Moscow under
different names from March 1917 to March 1919. After the October Socialist
Revolution the paper adopted an anti-Soviet attitude. It was closed down
for counter-revolutionary activities.

I propose that the signatures of the C.C. Politbureau
members be collected and these directives to the Ukrainian Communist Party
and its C.C. for the Ukraine be endorsed. Extremely

urgent.[2]

Forward urgently to the Ukrainian

    C.C.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
Marginal note added to the draft, apparently after it was
endorsed.—Ed. 
 



[2]
Lenin’s proposal was written on the draft resolution of the C.C. of the
R.C.P.(B.). The draft, with Lenin’s corrections, is signed by V. I. Lenin,
N. N. Krestinsky, and J. V. Stalin. The resolution states: “An essential
condition for success in the conduct of the war is unconditional unity of
action on all fronts, which, in turn, demands unity of Red Army command on
all fronts, unity of Red Army supply on all fronts and unity of transport
management of all railways, since transport is of primary importance in the
conduct of war.” The resolution stresses the need for the strictest
directives being given to the Commissariats for the Army and the Navy as
well as to the supply agencies of the Soviet Republics “in order that
these independent commissariats work exclusively in strict conformity with
the directives given by the appropriate Commissariats of the R. S. F.S.R.,
since only in this way can the necessary unity, dispatch and accuracy be
achieved in the fulfilment of all orders and operations.” 

The resolution goes on to say that “the most urgent
task in the Ukraine is to make maximum use of fuel, metals, existing
factories and workshops, and also stocks of food”. Pointing out that the
whole industry of the Ukraine was concentrated in the eastern part of the
republic and that the transfer of the Economic Council from Kharkov to Kiev
had adversely affected the rehabilitation of transport and of the mining
and manufacturing industries of the Ukraine, the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.)
recognised the need for the Economic Council as well as the Special
Commission for Army Supplies of the Ukraine being located in Kharkov or
having competent agencies in Kharkov authorised to deal directly with
Moscow and to receive money appropriations directly from Moscow. The
C.C. of the Party emphasised that “the Ukrainian railways are an
inseparable part of the Russian railway network and are managed by the
People’s Commissariat for Railways from Moscow.” The resolution also
states that “the People’s Commissariat for State Control of the
R.S.F.S.R. should cover all institutions in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of
the C.P.S.U.).



This resolution of the Party’s Central Committee was an important step
towards strengthening unity in military affairs among the Soviet
Republics. On April 24, 1919, in connection with Commander-in-Chief
I. I. Vatsetis’s memorandum on the military situation in the R.S.F.S.R.,
urging the need for uniting the armed forces of the Soviet Republics and
subordinating them to a single command, Lenin wrote to E. M. Sklyansky
asking him to urgently draft the text  of the C.C. directive to
all “nationals” concerning military unity (unification)” (Collected
Works, Vol. 50,  Fifth Russian Edition, Document 528). For “Draft
C.C. Directive on Army Unity” see present edition, Vol. 29,
pp. 404-05. The military union of the Soviet Republics was officially
implemented on June 1, 1919, by a decree of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee “On the Unification of the Soviet Republics of Russia,
the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Byelorussia for Fighting World
Imperialism”.

Suspend for 3 months or substantially cut down those
departments in the central and local commissariats that are not absolutely
essential and that may provide useful workers for the army and the home
front for the conduct of war, for food collection, agitation and so
on.

On April 21, 1919, Lenin made a report “On Stepping Up Work in the

document printed hero is apparently a rough draft of the concluding part of
the resolution on this question.

I fully subscribe to the text of the appeal and believe
that the Hungarian proletarians at the fronts will bear in mind that
another few months of struggle for the interests

    

of the international proletariat will bring us victory—a victory that
will be decisive and real. 

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This postscript was written to Bela Kun’s appeal on behalf of the
Soviet Government of Hungary to the Hungarian soldiers serving in the Red
Army. “You, Hungarian internationalists,” the appeal stated, “who are
fighting on Russian soil against the bands of Kolchak and
counter-revolution, are also fighting for the Hungarian Soviet Republic
just as your comrades are doing in Hungary, for Hungary and Russia today
form a single whole.” This appeal was issued in April 1919 in Hungarian
and promulgated on the civil war fronts. 

The Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U. have the text of the
postscript in Russian in the handwriting of L. M. Karakhan. It runs: “I
whole-heartedly support the appeal of our Magyar comrades.  I hope the
interests of the international cause will come first with our Magyar
comrades, We must hold out another few months and victory will be
assured. Lenin”.

Notes
 
 



[1]
On May 31, 1919, the Council of Defence considered questions relating
to mobilisation. The Council endorsed the decree drafted by Lenin (see
pp. 138-39 of this volume) and decisions directing the People’s
Commissariat for Food to provide themobilised men with food and ordering
the conscription status of employees in all departments and institutions to
be checked with the object of placing at the disposal of the military
command all such persons who were liable for service in the armed forces
and who could be replaced without great detriment to the work by persons
who were not liable or by women.

The delay in endorsing the instructions concerning food
parcels from the

army{1} is an outrageous and intolerable piece of red tape. 

It is necessary to ascertain who the culprits are and
generally have this case investigated, first, in order to establish
responsibility, second—and most important of all—in order to work out


practical measures to make a repetition of this impossible. 

I therefore order the institutions listed below, who were
to have taken care of the speedy enforcement of the law on food parcels,


to immediately, rigorously and carefully investigate the cause of this
red tape by collecting


all relevant documents and questioning all persons
concerned


and submit to the C.P.C. on Tuesday their reports together
with their proposal of practical measures for eliminating red
tape. 

The institutions are:

       Secretariat of the C.P.C. and Council of Defence

       Central Committee of the Food Army

       Food Commissariat

       Military Commissariat

       Commissariat for Post and Telegraph. 

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Council of Defence on May 24, 1919, passed a decision allowing Red
Armymen of frontline units operating in the rich grain producing districts
to send food parcels to their families in the famine-stricken areas. The
Council ordered the Central Committee of the Food Army to submit not later
than June 1 a draft of detailed instructions for the implementation of this
decision. The draft was endorsed by the Council of Defence on July 23,
1919.

The instructions of the People’s Commissariat for

     Agriculture[1]

are to be modified and effective control is to be exercised through all
Soviet agencies in the spirit of the following propositions: 

1) Landowners or estate managers to be positively
prohibited from occupying posts in state farms of the same or neighbouring
uyezds in which these persons resided during the rule of the
landowners. 

2) Lists to be kept of estate managers and employees at
state farms and surveillance to be kept over them as strictly as over
military experts in respect of their counter-revolutionary bent. 

3) The number of representatives of uyezd and gubernia land
departments in state farms to be increased and greater control exercised
over them by these departments. 

4) Greater attention to the workers’ committees and their
activities to be demanded of the trade union council. 

5) Metayage and similar work in the state farms to be
prohibited. 

6) All state farm personnel to be prosecuted immediately in
the event of their being unable to prove fulfilment by them of Article 59
of the Statute on Socialist Land Settlement, providing for assistance to be
rendered to the local peasantry. 

7) Forms of reporting and informing the local peasant
population to be worked out for the state farms and workers’
committees. 

8) Monthly reports to the C.P.C. on fulfilment of the
present rules to be demanded of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture
and of the workers’ committee in addition to those of 1 or 2 gubernia land
departments of the most important gubernias. 
 

9) The Central Statistical Board to extend its monographic
description of the state farms by the inclusion of questions necessary for
checking fulfilment of the above points. 

10) Allocation of land to the state farms to be rechecked
for possible excessive allotment of land or its seizure by non-proletarian
organisations. 

11) Nomination of candidates to the state farms by the
gubernia and uyezd land departments to be made a general rule. 

12) Instructions and measures to be submitted to the
C.P.C. after preliminary consideration by a

      commission[2]

Sereda, Sapronov, Vladimirsky, Tsyurupa, Milyutin and

      Golubev.[3]

1
Draft Resolution of the C.C. Politbureau

Attaching serious importance to

Mamontov’s[1] operations and considering the speedy
destruction of his detachment an urgent matter, the Politbureau of
the C.C. resolves; 

1) once more to draw the attention of the People’s
Commissars for Post and Telegraph and for Railways to the necessity of
exerting every effort to improve post and telegraph connections in the
area of Mamontov’s operations and speed up the transportation of
troops in that area. 
 

2) Comrade Trotsky to be charged with 

(a) drawing up a draft appeal by telegraph to Party organisations of
the given area with a repeat appeal for more energetic
actions;
(b) taking part together with Comrade Lashevich (Lashevich retaining
personal command) in all operations for routing Mamontov, to the extent
of his complete liquidation, in order that the authority of the C.C. and
the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic may be displayed in
all these operations with greater speed and

determination[2];
(c) calling in volunteers against Mamontov from the gubernias of Tver,
Kostroma, Yaroslavl and Ivanovo-Voznesensk. 

2

Draft directives of the C.C. Politbureau to be
drawn up at once. 

It is considered politically essential 

1) to speed up transportation of the Belebei Bashkir Division to
Petrograd and effect this movement as energetically as possible; 

2) Tula and the defence of the north generally against Mamontov being
sufficiently covered, the 21st Division, in its known and greater part, is
to be transferred to the Southern Front with the double objective of
catching Mamontov from the south and taking part in the fighting on the
Southern Front. 
3

I propose the following addenda to the decision of the Politbureau
(measures against Mamontov): 

1) appointment of chiefs of every section (10 to 30 versts,
etc.) in case of encirclement, of whom 1-2 to be Communists. 

2) those refusing to leave the railway cars to be shot on the spot;


3) further draconian measures to tighten discipline. 

The right of decision to introduce these measures to be given to
Lashevich + Trotsky. 
 
((Redirect before reaching Moscow.)) 

+3) Speed up dispatch of each troop train of the 21st
Division to go into immediate action against Mamontov with the addition
(if necessary) of Communists. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Marnontov’s mounted corps was launched by Denikin for attacks behind
the lines of the Soviet troops on the Southern Front. On August 10, 1919,
Marnontov’s cavalry broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk
and raided several towns and villages. This cavalry raid created a threat
to the Soviet troops, made offensive operations difficult and interfered
with army control and supply in a number of places. The Party and the
Government took emergency measures to fight Mamontov’s cavalry. On August23
the Council of Defence declared martial law in Ryazan, Tula, Orel,
Voronezh, Tambov and Penza gubernias, on the territory of which all power
was vested in the Revolutionary Committees. These were responsible for
organising defence against whiteguard attacks and suppressing
counter-revolutionary actions. Lenin attached great importance to the
organisation of Mamontov’s defeat. The latter’s corps was routed in
October-November 1919. 



[2]
Lenin had repeatedly demanded that the Revolutionary Military Council
of the Republic, headed by Trotsky, take drastic meas-ures to fight
Mamontov’s troops. On September 16, 1919, Lenin wrote: “Inaction against
Mamontov. Evidently, there has been one delay after another. The troops
marching on Voronezh from the North were late. We were late in transferring
the 21st Divi-sion to the South. We were late with the armoured cars. Late
with communications .... Apparently our R.M.C.R. ‘gives orders’, without
being interested in or able to follow up fulfilment. This maybe our common
vice but in military affairs it simply means destruction” (see present
edition, Vol. 35, pp. 420-21).

Comrade Chicherin,

I am sending you the decision of the

Politbureau[2] 
Yours, 

Lenin 

(1) Certainly. 

(2) Not


in the name of the Government. 

(3) Hasten Litvinov’s departure. 

(4) Confine ourselves to Gorky’s letter,

but not 

allow him
to use the argument about the struggle being turned into annihilation. 

Members of the Politbureau:

    Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The decision was signed also by Kamenev, Trotsky and Krestinsky (the
latter with the stipulation “I agree reservedly”)—Ed. 
 



[2]
The decision of the Politbureau accompanying Lenin’s note was adopted
in connection with Chicherin’s letter to Lenin dated September 26, 1919, in
which Chicherin asked for instruc-tions on the following points: 1) could
an appeal he made without the decision of the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.) to the
workers of the Entente countries to bring pressure to bear on their
Governments not to interfere in the Soviet state’s negotiations with the
Baltic states for concluding peace treaties? 2) Should we make new peace
proposals to the Entente countries in the name of the Soviet Government?
“This,” wrote Chicherin, “would be construed as a sign of weakness
.... On the other hand, it would give an opening to the opponents of
intervention, especially to the trade unions”; 3) Could we take advantage
of Litvinov’s proposed trip to a neutral country to negotiate an exchange
of prisoners of war with the English representatives in order to “throw
out a feeler on the question of peace”? 4) In the event of Litvinov’s
mission being a failure would it be worth while asking A.M. Gorky, who
intended to make an appeal for peace, to mention in his letter “our
invariable desire for peace and to point out to the Governments of the
Entente the risk of the

struggle being turned into annihilation”?

(underlined by Lenin). “However,” wrote Chicherin, “we should much prefer
an official peace proposal...”  (Central Party Archives, Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.). On this question see also
V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Volume 51, Fifth Russian Edition,
Document 85.

The C.P.C. considers: 

1) that the State Control should have recommended the S.E.C. to close
its legal departments, but should not have applied a proscriptive order;


2)that the Board of the S.E.C. should immediately take energetic
measures to close its legal departments,

    

most of which are parasitical, and to prohibit members of these departments
from being hidden away in other departments. Fulfilment to be reported to
the Narrow

C.P.C.[2] within a week; 

3) the Commissariat for Justice to take legal action against members of
the legal departments of the Food Commissariat and the S.E.C, for red tape.
Fulfilment to be reported to the Narrow Council within a week. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The conflict arose through an order of the People’s Commissariat for
State Control to do away with nine legal departments of the S.E.C. The
latter lodged a complaint against the State Control with the Narrow Council
of People’s Commissars. The C.P.C. endorsed the decision of the Narrow
Council in this connection on September 30, 1919, and adopted Lenin’s
motion with slight amendments, namely: Point 3 was added, reading: “The
same to be demanded of all committees within a fortnight”, while Point 3
of Lenin’s draft was endorsed as Point 4 of the decision worded as follows:
“The Commissariat jor Justice to institute investigations with the object
of taking legal action against members of the S.E.C.’s legal departments
for red tape. Fulfilment to be reported to the Narrow Council within a
week” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.C. of the C.P.S.U.)  



[2]
The Narrow C.P.C. was set up in December 1917 to relieve the agenda of
the C.P.C. of minor questions; it had the status of a
C.P.C. commission. All the decisions unanimously adopted by the Narrow
Council were signed by Lenin and acquired the force of C.P.C. decisions; in
cases of disagreement the business was referred to the C.P.C.

Suggestions

1) that Soltz should devote himself entirely to noncommercial
activities (literary, instructor’s work, and so forth) in the
co-operatives, 

2) that if this cannot be published as a separate edition, it should be
published, i.e., printed, in Izvestia, Pravda and

Bednota,{2} 
3) that


factual

information
be

quickly

collected, from at least small districts, concerning the


extent

to which the

decree{3} is being carried out in general (in all its parts) and
particularly concerning the methods of purveyance and distribution (bodies,
forms, conditions, exceptions to the rule and so on), and the
transformation, or beginning of the transformation, of bourgeois
co-operation into communist co-operation, etc. 
 

Notes

The suggestions were written in connection with a
meeting of the communist groups of Centrosoyuz and the Food
Commissariat arranged by the C.P.C. and chaired by Lenin on
October 9, 1919.

Bednota (The Poor)-a peasant daily, published in Moscow from March
27, 1918 to January 31, 1931. The newspaper was founded by decision of the
C«C. of the R.C.P.(B.) in lieu of the newspapers Derevenskaya
Bednota (The Rural Poor), Derevenskaya Pravda (Rural Truth)
and Soldatskaya Pravda (Soldiers’ Truth). The newspaper carried on
an active campaign to strengthen the alliance between the working class and
the peasantry, to organise and rally the mass of the poor and middle
peasants behind the Communist Party and the Soviet
Government. Bednota played an important role in promoting the
political education and raising the cultural level of the labouring
peasantry, in advancing public-spirited activists from among the rural poor
and the middle peasantry, and training a numerous army of rural
correspondents. On February 1, 1931, Bednota merged with the
newspaper Sotsialisttcheskoye Zemiedeliye (Socialist
Agriculture).

Comrade Lenin met the Ambassador in his private office with
the words, “I am very glad to see in the red capital of the worker and
peasant government the representative of the friendly Afghan people, who
are suffering and fighting against imperialist oppression.” To which the
Ambassador replied: “I proffer you a friendly hand and hope that you will
help the whole of the East to free itself from the yoke of European
imperialism.” During the talk that followed, Lenin said that Soviet power,
the power of the working people and the oppressed, was striving towards the
very goal the Afghan Ambassador Extraordinary had spoken about, but that it
was necessary that the Moslem East should realise this and help Soviet
Russia in her great war of liberation. To this the Ambassador replied that
he could assert that the Moslem East realised this and the hour was not far
off when the world would see that there was no room for European
imperialism in the East. 

Afterwards the Ambassador stood up and with the words: “I
have the honour of presenting my Sovereign’s letter to the Head of the free
Russian proletarian Government and hope that the Soviet Government will
give due consideration to what the Afghan Government is writing about,” he
handed Lenin the Amir’s letter. Comrade Lenin answered that he accepted
the letter with the greatest pleasure and promised shortly to give a reply
to all the questions Afghanistan was interested

in.{2}

In his speech Comrade Lenin described the general situation
at our fronts and pointed out that it was the duty of every intelligent
worker to render the greatest possible assistance to our fronts in the
matter of proper supply of munitions, food, clothing, etc. 

He expressed his conviction that the communist workers of
Ivanovo-Voznesensk would be able to exercise a beneficial influence on the
peasants in the front-line area and be a great help in conducting political
work among the Cossacks. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The speech was made at Trade Union House in Moscow to communist workers
of Ivanovo-Voznesensk who were on their way to the front. On October 3 a
town Party meeting had been held in lvanovo-Voznesensk at which every Party
member was called upon to spare no effort to defeat Denikin’s army, and the
Party organisations were called upon to start mobilising Communists for the
front. On October 9 the Bureau of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Committee
passed a decision to announce a general Party mobilisation, In a short
period about 350 men were mobilised. The first group was seen off on
October 22 and arrived in Moscow on October 24. In a letter to the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front Lenin wrote: “I
heartily recommend the bearer, Comrade Stepan Nazarov, a Bolshevik whom I
have known personally for a long time. 

“Together with other Ivanovo-Voznesensk comrades they
formed a well-planned organised group (of from 300 to 500 men) for
giving all-round service to and raising the morale of a whole army. 

“I heartily recommend the comrades and request you
earnestly to take all steps not to lose sight of them, but make proper and
careful use of them” (Collected Works, Vol.  51, Fifth Russian
Edition, Document 121).

The conference opened with a speech by Lenin. He greeted
the students of the courses, who had resolved to go out to the front to
help the Red Army, and gave a vivid description of the present situation on
all the fronts and in the enemy’s rear. 

The bourgeoisie, both of Russia and the West, had begun to celebrate
victory prematurely. The Red troops were driving Kolchak before
them. Denikin was retreating from Orel. There was demoralisation among the
White troops. In Denikin’s rear there were uninterrupted uprisings. Today
even the prosperous Cossacks were going against him. 

Yudenich had scant forces, consisting mainly of Englishmen. Britain had
given him a large fleet. Yudenich’s offensive was intended to save Denikin,
draw our forces off, but his plan failed-the workers of Petrograd had
displayed

    

examples of heroism. Europe was tensely watching the outcome of the
struggle. The workers of France and Britain had already registered their
protest against the attack upon Russia. Bolshevism in these countries was
gaining ground. The elections in France were very significant in this

respect.[1] Our chief attention was now directed to the Southern Front,
where indescribably furious and sanguinary battles were raging, and where
the fate of the revolution in the West as well as in Russia was being
decided... 
Denikin’s officer corps was well armed. In view of the uprisings in
their rear, they were putting up a desperate fight. But the worker and
peasant masses were beginning to see things clearer and there was a strong
upsurge among them. Our weakness was that we had too few knowledgeable
organisers among the peasants and workers. That was why we had so many old
officials, saboteurs, etc., in our institutions. It was necessary to
advance the best workers from among the people, and give them
knowledge.... 
It was important to have social-minded people capable of talking to the
peasants, people who would raise the morale of the army, and therefore
everyone going to the front should show an example of bravery and selfless
dedication. Victory then will be ours. We shall put transport in order and
bring in grain....

A commission to be elected to consider the question. 

The chief and most pressing task to be dealt with is, first, renewal
and reorganisation of the staffs of the food

    

supply agencies; second, injecting a spirit of initiative into the work of
these organisations. 

Practical steps for carrying out these tasks to be outlined as follows:


enlisting the participation of the workers’ co-operatives on the
broadest basis; 

ditto the bourgeois co-operatives, though on a narrower basis; 

developing the workers’ food inspection more rapidly into an
organisation of workers’ co-operation in all fields of food supply work;


introducing a bonus system for different groups of office employees,
workers and specially recommended persons from among all groups of the
population, whose participation in the work should be permitted and
encouraged. 

The commission is not to be limited to these tasks, which are to be
accepted by it as an approximate definition of its general line of
work. 

Non-food-supply staff workers to be elected to the commission. 

I suggest for the commission

       Kamenev

       V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich

      

      Schmidt 

      
Enlist without fail, not as a member of the commission

the Food Commissariat on the question of the transportation of grain from
the producing to the consuming areas. “The agreement,” stated the
Council’s decision, “should ensure regular deliveries to Moscow of such a
quantity of breadstuffs as was necessary for its class ration

Notes
 

[1]
December 27, 1919.—Ed.  
 



[2]
Lenin wrote this draft in connection with the discussion, at a meeting
of the C.P.C. on December 23, 1919, of the question of the Kazan, Simbirsk
and Samara gubernia food commissars’ failure to carry out the order of the
Food Commissariat concerning grain consignments to Moscow by through
trains. The draft was adopted by the Council with certain amendments. 



[3]
From the reports of speakers it transpired that one of the prin-cipal
reasons for non-fulfilment of the order was the delay on the part of the
Commissariat for Post and Telegraph in giving the Food Commissariat a
direct line for communicating with the local areas. This point was adopted
by the Council in the following wording: “In all cases of non-receipt of a
direct line the guilty party shall be that commissariat, which, not having
received the line in the course of an hour for carrying out an important
assignment, shall have failed to complain about it to the Chair-man of the
C.P.C.” (Lenin Miscellany XXIV, p. 147). 



[4]
This point was adopted by the C.P.C. in the following wording: 

“The Commissariat for Justice is instructed to institute
investigations to determine the culpability of the gubernia food commissars
and other officials guilty of non-fulfilment of the Food Commissariat’s
order for through trains with grain to be consigned to Moscow or of failure
to fulfil same through bad organisation“ (Lenin Miscellany XXIV,
p. 147).

Comrade Popov, 

Will you please-if i is not too much trouble to you—return the
enclosed table to me with your remarks: 

on the basis of statistical science and its modern data on Russia 

(aa) could such a table be drawn up or not (on the strength, at least,
of insufficient data)? 

(bb) if it could, what would be the chief corrections? 

(cc) would any of your specialists undertake to draw up such a table
(even if with a wider amplitude of fluctuations)? 

Yours, 

Lenin

The Narrow Council to be instructed immediately, but not
later than

      Saturday,[1]

to revise its decision, leaving its basic and general parts intact, but
changing the figures of issue to the workers in accordance with the new
military plans of army increase Comrade Rykov to issue an exactly worded
mandate to his representative and only be is to be

admitted.[3]

[2]
On December 23, 1919, the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars
examined the question of supplying the workers with cloathes and
footwear. It decided to use for this purpose part of the stocks reserved
for the Red Army, but in a manner that would not be detrimental to the
army. At the end of December the Central Army Supply Administration was to
have issued to the Food Commissariat from army stores 30,000 pairs of
leather boots, while the S.E.C. undertook to deliver to the Food
Commissariat every fortnight 20 per cent of all the boots manufactured in
the country. 

Apparently this decision of the Narrow Council met with
objection on the part of the Presidium of the S.E.C, as a result of which
the C.P.C. passed a decision based on this draft of Lenin’s.  



[3]
This motion was adopted by the C.P.C. in the following wording
“Comrade Rykov shall give an exact mandate to his represeatative for all
meetings on the question of working clothes and delegate only him.” 

The question was examined a second time by the Narrow
Council on January 3, 1920, this time in the presence of Chairman of the
S.E.C. A. I. Rykov, who was ordered to supply monthly to the Food
Commissariat’s agencies, as from January 1, 1920, not less than 40,000
pairs of men’s working boots, not counting clogs, bast sandals and felt
boots.

The Vecheka is to issue within three weeks detailed
instructions not only governing the activities of the Transport Dept. of
the Vecheka, but establishing strict responsibility of the Department’s
agents for oversight and failure to report cases of sabotage or
profiteering. 

In particular the agents of the T.D. of the Vecheka must be in contact
with the communist and trade union cells of the truly proletarian section
of the railwaymen who do not abuse their position for the purpose of
systematic blackmarketing.

The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs is to adopt a
policy of extreme restraint and mistrust towards the Azerbaijan Government
in view of the latter’s refusal to accept our offer of joint military
operations against Denikin and the services it is rendering to the military
forces of Britain operating against us in the Caspian Sea, While
emphatically stressing our undeviating recognition of the right of the
working masses of every nation to self-determination, the Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs should vigorously protest against such conduct on the part
of the Azerbaijan

Government.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 2, 1920, the Soviet Government proposed to the Mussavatist
Government of Azerbaijan an agreement for joint action against
Denikin. This offer was turned down. Following a report by the People’s
Commissar for Foreign Affairs G. V. Chicherin on the possibility of peace
negotiations with Azerbaijan made at a meeting of the Politbureau on
January 17 and 18, 1920, the latter adopted Lenin’s motion on this
question.

In view of the Entente’s intention to effect an exchange of
commodities through the co-operatives with the patent design of using the
co-operatives as an instrument for restoring capitalism, the C.C. instructs
the Chairman of Centrosoyuz, the People’s Commissariat for Food, the
Chairman of the S.E.C. and the People’s Commissariat for Trade to consider
the question of the cooperatives very carefully from this angle and
immediately work out measures ensuring full control on our part of the
co-operative machinery primarily at all the points where such trade may be
arranged (the Ukraine, the Soviet Far East).

The Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
and the State Control Commissariat to be asked to be guided by the
following directives of the C.C., R.C.P.: 

1. No new bodies to be set up- in any field of state
administration, and the existing commissariats to be improved. 

2. The Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to be developed,
strengthened and extended in every way, all work being directed towards
ensuring complete numerical predominance of workers and peasants in State
Control. 

3. No skilled workers, only unskilled workers, mainly
women, to be enlisted in the Workers’ Inspection. 

4. A new draft of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection under
the State Control Commissariat to be drawn up immediately with the
co-operation of Avanesov and submitted to the Politbureau not later than
28.I.1920. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of reorganising the State Control Commissariat into a
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection was raised at the end of 1919 and
discussed at the Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets. A commission
consisting of representatives of the State Control, the All-Russia Central
Council of Trade Unions and the All-Russia C.E.C. was set up to draft
regulations governing the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. Opinion in the
commission being divided, the question was referred to the Politbureau,
which passed its decision on January 23, 1920, on the basis of the
directives moved by Lenin.

Regarding bonuses, I have strong doubts. 

§ 4—absolutely arbitrary fixing of the standard
(50%—exactly 50%—from “the best”, i.e., given the best machines,
etc. This is quite arbitrary. Can’t we have it more exact? Publish
standards for control? Or collect them for the scientific-technical
department, etc., and publish in a bulletin?). 

Account of results: top limit of bonuses. Accounts on this not provided
for. Will this not virtually legalise gross abuses? 

Consumers should be enlisted for standard control. Are there
any examples of this? Among the co-operatives? and so on. 

The draft is too sweeping, abstract, unbusiness-like; promises
everything, verifies

nothing.[1] 

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Point 4 of the draft regulations on bonuses for workers and office
employees, about which Lenin had his doubts, was worded as follows:
“4. Standard output shall be established on the basis of technically
possible output under the best technical conditions of production, provided
the means and implements of production are in a normal condition. In view,
however, of the general conditions prevailing in industry, a deduction
should be made from this technically possible standard, but in no case more
than 50 per cent, after which the actual standard of productivity, varying
with the different trades, enterprises and groups, shall be fixed.” 

At its meeting on February 1, 1920, the Narrow
C.P.C. resolved that, the draft decision on bonuses shall be returned to
the People’s Commissariat for Labour for revision in accordance with
Comrade Lenin’s directions”. 

A decision “On the Procedure for Endorsing Bonus
Projects” was adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on June 8 and
published in Izvestia  on June 10, 1920.

At a meeting of executive committee chairmen preceding the
opening of the

session,[1] Lenin said, in dealing with the current situation: 

In so far as the international situation stays as it is, and the whole
course of events points to its stability, the tasks of economic activities
should be advanced by us to the fore. As regards transport, we not only
have to bring

    

this to the fore, but simply drag this transport out by the ears, save it
from imminent disaster. Trains carrying grain are stopping, we have more
grain than we can transport. Military operations are often impeded through
lack of transport. February is the most difficult month for transport, and
we are simply heading for disaster. 

We are threatened by a danger of transport dislocation more serious
than in October, when Yudenich and Denikin were winning their biggest
victories. More energy must be applied to save transport. We must carry out
mobilisations here again and again. We shall have to rob a number of
institutions of their workers and keep on robbing them to combat the chaos
in transport. 

The whole art of government and policy-making consists in being able to
assess and know in good time where to concentrate your main forces and
attention. We must now extricate transport in the course of two
months. Unless we work the same miracle in two months with transport as we
have done with Kolchak, disaster threatens us. 

A number of vigorous and revolutionary measures are needed. This is a
military and combat task and calls for combat action in military
style.

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was moved by Lenin at a meeting of the Council of People’s
Commissars on February 5, 1920, in connection with L. B. Krasin’s report on
the question of granting privileges to workers engaged on locomotive
repairs and the production of spare parts for transport. 

The following resolution was adopted on the report:
’The S.E.C., the Commissariat for Food and the Commissariat for Railways
are instructed to examine in detail the question of all privileges applying
to workers engaged in locomotive repairs and the production of spare parts
for transport, and to present a list of factories to the C.P.C.”  



[2]
The question of “using the best workshops for repairs all 24 hours
of the day”  was discussed at a meeting of the C.P.C. on March 16,
1920. The question of intensive and uninterrupted work on the repair of
locomotives was raised by Lenin in connection with the catastrophic state
of railway transport, and this led to a number of other questions being
discussed at the same Council meeting, namely: the possibility of placing
an order abroad for locomotives and spare parts for repairing railway
transport, and an inspection of factories and works engaged in the repair
of goods train cars and engines.

Comrades, you will now have to carry on your work under
conditions when Soviet Russia is passing to a new phase of activities. You
all know, of course, that these conditions of the transition period are due
both to international and internal conditions, or rather to the changed

    

situation both on the international and home fronts that has taken place
recently. 

The fundamental change is that the main forces of the whiteguard
counter-revolution have been smashed after the defeat of Yudenich and
Kolchak and after the victory over Denikin. We have to be cautious, though,
since a hitch has recently occurred near Rostov and at Novocherkassk, and
there is a danger that Denikin may recover. Nevertheless, the main
victories create a new situation. Obviously, the bourgeoisie cannot
seriously count on things taking a turn in their favour, all the more as
the international situation, too, has changed greatly, changed to such an
extent that the Entente has been obliged to lift the blockade. We have been
able to conclude peace with Estonia. In this respect we have achieved a
basic success which has greatly strengthened our position, and we shall
probably secure peace with all the other border states, and then an
invasion by the Entente will practically be ruled out. 

Thus, the first acute moment of our struggle with the
counter-revolution, with the whiteguard armed force, both overt and
covert-this first acute period is apparently passing. It is more than
likely, however, that attempts at one or another counter-revolutionary
movement and revolt will be repeated, and, besides, the experience of the
Russian revolutionary movement shows that attempts of a purely terrorist
nature are often accompanied by a mass armed struggle, and therefore it is
natural to expect that the counter-revolutionary armed officer force-an
element probably most accustomed to handling and using arms-will not miss a
chance to make use of these arms for their own ends. 

So though the death sentence, after the capture of Rostov, has been
abolished on Comrade Dzerzhinsky’s initiative, a reservation was made at
the very beginning that we do not by any means close our eyes to the
possibility of restoring capital punishment. With us this is a matter of
expediency. It goes without saying that the Soviet government will not keep
the death penalty longer than is absolutely necessary, and by doing away
with it, has taken a step that no democratic government of any bourgeois
republic has ever taken. 
 

You are aware that the great majority of the workers and peasants in
all the outlying districts, who were under the yoke of the whiteguards,
have come over to our side. The longer they were under that yoke the more
strongly have they sided with us. And so we know that all the attempts of
the bourgeoisie are doomed to failure. But that these attempts are
possible, we know only too well from the two years’ experience of Soviet
power. We have seen tens of thousands of officers, landowner elements,
stopping. at no crimes, concluding agreements with the agents of
imperialist foreign powers to blow up bridges. And we say that attempts
like these will go on. With due consideration for the new general position
of the state, we must nevertheless remain alert and remember that though
the period of armed struggle on a big historical scale is coming to end, we
must on no account exclude the possibility of our having to keep in a state
of preparedness. 

The problem set before. the agencies of suppression of the
counter-revolution, before the agencies of the Cheka, and still facing them
today, is a complex and difficult one. On the one hand, they must realise
and make allowance for the transition from war to peace, and, on the other,
they must be on guard all the time, since we do not know how long it will
take to secure a lasting peace; we must take into account what effect this
new approach will have on the bourgeois sections of the population, we must
bear in mind, test in practice what these changes will yield, and only
after all this has been taken into consideration, introduce one or another
modification on the basis of such practical experience. 

In a word, we must continue to keep fighting fit to be able to repulse
the enemy. There may possibly be attempts at invasion, Denikin may possibly
fortify his position to continue the civil war, there may possibly be
attempts at terror on the part of groups of counter-revolutionaries, and it
is our duty to be always in fighting trim. While keeping in fighting trim,
keeping the apparatus for suppressing the resistance of the exploiters
alerted, we must take into account the new transition from war to peace and
gradually change our tactics, change the nature of repressive
measures. 
 

This question, I believe, played no small part in your discussions, and
you, of course,, have much more to go on than I have in the matter of
practical concrete decisions. I have no doubt that you will try to study
this material in a concrete, practical way. You must work out in what
direction the agencies for suppressing the counter-revolution are to modify
their activities in the recently liberated parts of Russia, in Siberia and
the Ukraine, how, in keeping with this, we are to change our activities. I
shall not go into details or enlarge on this, because I have not had a
chance to study the factual material, but I repeat-the important thing is
to take into account the concrete facts that have come to light in the work
of every Cheka. Moreover, the aim of such conferences is to enable you to
discuss the factual material in greatest possible detail, so that local
workers should not shut themselves up in their own narrow circle, but
should be able, as a result of such an exchange of opinions, to devise more
durable and lasting tactics. 

I should like in particular to draw attention to a question that now
confronts the agencies of suppression of the counter-revolution, the
agencies combating espionage and profiteering, namely, to the bloodless
front of labour, a question that is now becoming a key issue in the
building up of Soviet power, in the strengthening of the workers’ and
peasants’ rule and the revival of the ruined economy. 

You know that the task of fighting Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin, who
have been supported by the Entente, the task of fighting the
counter-revolutionary landowners and capitalists who were convinced up till
now that their victory was secure, since the wealthiest Powers in the world
were on their side-this task called for an exertion of all the country’s
strength, because the very existence of the Soviet Republic was at
stake. 

During these two years Soviet power can be said to have accomplished
what is nothing short of a miracle, for in the struggle against
international capital we have succeeded in winning such an incredible, such
an amazing victory as the world has never known. This has happened because
all our forces were closely united, because we had a real dictatorship of
the proletariat in action in the sense that the vanguard, the best advance
guard of the working class

    

during these two years of Soviet government displayed unheard-of heroism
and determination, while all the vacillating elements among the less
developed section of the working class and the peasantry, who went through
a long range of fluctuations, found themselves leaning more and more to our
side. The more trials they went through, the sooner did they side with
us. 

To achieve such a concentration of forces we had to resort to measures
of coercion in face of all the lamentations, regrets and complaints. Both
before and after the October Revolution we held the view that the birth of
a new order was impossible without revolutionary coercion, that all the
regrets and complaints that we hear from non-Party petty-bourgeois
intellectuals are simply reactionary. History, which is propelled by a
fierce class struggle, has shown that when the landowners and capitalists
felt that it was a question of the last decisive fight, they stopped at
nothing. 

History has shown that without revolutionary coercion victory cannot be
achieved. Without revolutionary coercion directed against the avowed
enemies of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the
resistance of these exploiters. On the other hand, revolutionary coercion
is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable elements among
the masses themselves. 

Today we are witnessing the tremendous victory of the Red Army, but if
we look back over the last two years of Soviet government and think of how
we advanced towards these victories, we are bound to remember that the
October Revolution started when the army was completely demoralised and
there was a complete absence of any military organisation. We had no army,
and were obliged to scrape one together, to weld, muster and build this
army up anew by long hard work. And in building up this new disciplined Red
Army we had to resort to revolutionary coercion. And this revolutionary
coercion was quite rightly applied to self-seeking elements. At a time when
the advanced section of the population were giving all their strength to
the fight against the counter-revolution, at a time when thousands of them,
with the greatest self-sacrifice, were laying down their lives on the
fields of battle, the backward elements among the peasantry, who had
received land, and the

    

backward elements among the workers, were working only for themselves. At
that time the advanced elements had to build up and strengthen the new
discipline, which was maintained by revolutionary coercion and which could
be so maintained only because the public-spirited section of the workers
and peasants, of all the working masses, sympathised with this coercion,
realised that without this iron discipline we could not have built up the
Red Army, could not have held our own in the two years of struggle and
generally could not have stood up against organised and united capital. In
this respect, the tasks of cultivating discipline, maintaining discipline
and rallying our forces to face the coming struggle-these tasks are now
gradually being modified. At first we gave all our forces to the war, all
the forces of the ruined country. This condemned the country to still
greater ruin. 

No one believed two years ago that Russia, a country ravaged by four
years of imperialist war, could withstand another two years of civil
war. In fact, if we were asked at the end of October 1917 whether we would
survive two years of civil war against the world’s bourgeoisie, I doubt
whether many of us would have answered in the affirmative. Events, however,
have shown that the energy which the worker and peasant masses developed
proved to be greater than the people who had made the October Revolution
believed. As a result, we have received-and the home fronts have shown us-a
source of new strength considerably greater than anything we had counted
on. At the same time this source has shown that the Red Army, which is
capable of winning victories on the war fronts, is meeting with new
obstacles on the home fronts-this is particularly the case in transport. Of
course, things are bad with us as regards food, too, cold and hunger are
worse than ever now, but with the liberation of the richest grain-producing
gubernias the food situation is improving, and our chief crisis now is
transport. It should be said that the same crisis exists in all the richest
countries, who have never experienced such a long war. Even these countries
are suffering from a shortage of railway cars. So you can imagine what is
happening with us in Russia, who has been at war six years and had had her
bridges and locomotives deliberately destroyed. 
 

Our position, in this respect, is a very difficult one, of course, and
the task of the Cheka’s transport departments, of their whole organism, the
efforts of all the revolutionary social-minded masses, are aimed at helping
the country to extricate itself from this critical plight, which without
exaggeration can be said to verge on catastrophe. Another thing to be borne
in mind is that the state of the railways in February, what with the winter
snowdrifts, is always worse, even during ordinary times, than at any other
season. At present our transport crisis has reached a stage when the
railways are threatened with a complete stoppage. Lately, Moscow has had
only a three-day supply of bread, while dozens of trains have been held up
through lack of fuel. 

We are well aware of the methods for coping with this disastrous
situation, which we have been using during two years of war. These methods
are-raising the social consciousness of the masses and appealing directly
to them. In every such crisis we deemed it our duty to appeal to the worker
and peasant masses and describe to them the difficult situation that had
arisen. We appealed to them and pointed out on whom the salvation of Soviet
Russia depended and what effort was needed to concentrate on a single
definite task. These tasks often changed while Soviet power was engaged in
fighting its enemies, and a proper understanding of the state’s position
depends upon the ability to grasp what tasks have to be tackled in order to
cope with the economic chaos and pass on to the normal work of economic
organisation. Now, too, you know that most attention was given to
explaining the critical position of the railways to the workers and
peasants. A tremendous effort is needed here on the part of the proletariat
and the peasantry. Such a thing as the delivery of fuel is a difficult
problem, which cannot possibly be coped with unless the worker and peasant
population give themselves to the task with enthusiasm, unless there is a
spurt of collective mass effort such as we witnessed during the best period
of the Red Army’s victories. Today, for example, the delivery of fuel and
the clearing of railway tracks meet with difficulties arising from the fact
that the peasants were given a number of promises to compensate them for
their food products. Naturally,

    

deliveries require draft horses, and the peasants out there are unable to
provide these, they are very unwilling and unfriendly, as they do not
receive compensation in the way of a definite amount of goods; and we,
owing to the almost complete stoppage of transport, are not in a position
to give them any commodities worth speaking of. We say that the peasants
should do this as a loan to their workers’ and peasants’ state in order to
save the starving workers and put industry on its feet. The peasants should
give this loan, because, for instance, in some places the peasantry are
suffering terribly from a shortage of salt, while we have enormous stocks
of this salt which we are unable to deliver since the railways do not cope
with the task of transporting the absolutely essential amount of
breadstuffs. 

We have here a situation that calls for still greater discipline, for
propaganda and agitation to educate and unite all the workers and
peasants. The use of revolutionary coercion turns this discipline into
something real and definite, showing that the class-conscious working class
has set itself a definite practical task, which we shall see through to its
conclusion. Just as in the period of our most difficult struggle against
Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin, when we advanced Communists, leading
workers, to the front ranks, made great sacrifices, giving the lives of our
best fighters and at the same time building up discipline and punishing
self-seekers-we achieved the maximum exertion of the people’s energy, and
we won; so today, too, we must set ourselves the same aim and achieve it at
all costs by the same methods if we are to save transport. 

We have grain, salt, we have sufficient quantities of raw materials and
fuel, we can put industry back on its feet, but this will take months of
hard efforts, and in these efforts the agencies of the Cheka must become an
instrument for carrying out the centralised will of the proletariat, an
instrument of discipline such as we succeeded in creating in the Red
Army. 

And I am sure that after this meeting, in the practical work of your
agencies, and here, too,. you will come to an understanding of the role the
uyezd transport departments of the Cheka are to play, of the way they
should organise their work, how they should advance new people from their

    

midst in order to fight the profiteers and saboteurs, who are more numerous
among the railwaymen than anywhere else. This is a task of your practical
experience, a task you will have to carry out by way of an exchange of
opinions. The railways are notable in that we have there a majority of
workers on a working-class level and a minority who engage in profiteering,
and here it is the task of the Transport Cheka to secure a correct division
of labour, responsibility for economising labour power, and secure all this
through the efforts of the communist elements among the railwaymen. Only by
relying on these best masses shall we he able to create a force that will
cope with profiteers and gain the upper hand over these elements,
recruited during the worst days of tsarism. To overcome this force
inherited by us from capitalism we have one means-that of tightening
discipline and developing revolutionary energy to the utmost. The Cheka
should rely on the communist groups, on the trade unions—combine its work
with propaganda and agitation, evoke among the bulk of the railwaymen a
conscious attitude towards this struggle. 

And I am sure that by strict organisation and with our previous
experience to go on, we shall achieve in our work results as good as those
we achieved in the armed struggle.

(Loud, continuous applause.)

The Speech at the Fourth Conference of Guberna Extraordinary
Commissions was delivered by Lenin at the morning plenary session on
February 6, 1920. The conference was called at a time when the Soviet
Republic, having defeated Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich, had gained a
temporary respite and was in a position to tackle its economic
problems. 

The conference was attended by 69 voting delegates and
7 delegates with a consultative voice. All the delegates were Communists,
the majority of the 69 voting delegates having joined the Party long before
the revolution. Most of the delegates were workers.

The Borotbists shall be qualified as a party, which, by its
propaganda aimed at splitting the military forces and supporting banditism,
is violating the basic principles of communism, thereby playing directly
into the hands of the Whites and of international imperialism. 

Also opposed to the interests of the proletariat is their struggle
against the slogan calling for a close alliance with the R.S.F.S.R. 
 

The whole policy must be systematically and steadily aimed at the
dissolution of the Borotbists in the near future. To this end, not a single
misdeed on the part of the Borotbists should be allowed to pass without
being immediately and strictly punished. In particular, information should
be collected concerning the non-proletarian and most disloyal nature of the
majority of their party members. 

The moment for their dissolution shall be determined within a short
time by the Politbureau and communicated to the Ukrainian Revolutionary

Committee.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Borotbists—members of a peasant based left-nationalist party,
Borotba, formed in May 1918 after a split in the Ukrainian Left
Socialist-Revolutionary Party on the basis of supporting soviet power in
Ukraine. So called from the name of the Party’s central organ Borotba
(Struggle). In March 1919 assumed the name of Ukrainian
Socialist-Revolutionary Party of Communist Borotbists, and in August that
of the Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists. Its leaders, among others,
were V. Blakitny, G. Grinko and A. Shumsky. For Lenin’s appraisal of the
Borotba Party see pp. 180-181 of this volume. 

The Borotbists twice applied to the Executive of the
Communist International asking to be admitted to membership of the
Comintern and to be recognised as the main communist party in the
Ukraine. The Comintern passed a special decision on this question on
February 26, 1920, proposing to the Borotbists that they dissolve their
party and merge with the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine. The
resolution said that the Executive of the Communist International could
only regard the desire to found a second parallel party as an attempt to
split the ranks of the working people. 

The growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the
peasantry and the successes of the Soviet government in the Ukraine forced
the Borotbists to decide on voluntary dissolution. 

The Fourth Conference of the Communist Party
(Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine, held March 17-23, 1920, agreed to admit the
Borotbists into its ranks, all the newly enrolled members being
reregistered. Eventually, however, many Borotbists resumed their
anti-Soviet activities and headed the struggle of the counter-revolutionary
bourgeois-nationalist elements in the Ukraine.

The manuscript further contains a note by Lenin reading: “Trotsky and
Rakovsky are instructed, not later than tomorrow, to word this resolution
more accurately and transmit it tomorrow by coded telegraph to the
Ukrainian Revolutionary Committee.”

Allies Playing “Chess Game”


Of the Allies’ reported decision to lift the blockade Lenin
   said: 


“It is hard to see sincerity behind so vague a proposal,
coupled as it seems to be with preparations to attack us afresh through
Poland. At first glance the Supreme Council’s proposition looks plausible
enough-the resumption of commercial relations through the medium of the
Russian co-operatives. But the co-operatives do not any longer exist,
having been assimilated into our Soviet distribution organs. Therefore what
is meant when the Allies talk of dealing with the co-operatives?
Certainly it is not clear. 

“Therefore I say that closer examination convinces us
that this Paris decision is simply a move in the Allied chess game the
motives of which are still obscure.” 


Lenin paused a moment, then added with a broad grin: 


“Far obscurer, for instance, than Marshal Foch’s intended visit to
Warsaw.” 


I asked if he deemed the probability of a Polish offensive serious (it
   must be recalled that in Russia the talk was of a drive by the Poles
   against the Boisheviki, not vice versa). 

 

“Beyond doubt,” Lenin replied, “Clemenceau and Foch are very, very
serious gentlemen, and the one originated and the other is going to carry
out this offensive scheme. It is a grave menace, of course, but we have
faced graver ones. It does not cause us fear so much as disappointment that
the Allies should still pursue the impossible. For a Polish offensive can
no more settle the Russian problem for them than did Kolchak’s and
Denikin’s. Poland has many troubles of her own, remember. And it is obvious
that she can get no help from any of her neighbours, including Roumania,”



   “Yet peace seems nearer than before,” I suggested. 


“Yes, that’s true. If peace is a corollary of trade with us, the
Allies cannot avoid it much longer. I have heard that Millerand,
Clemenceau’s successor, expresses willingness to envisage commercial
relations with the Russian people. Perhaps this heralds a change of front
among the French capitalists. But Churchill is still strong in England, and
Lloyd George, who probably wants to do business with us, dare not risk an
open rupture with the political and financial interests supporting the
Churchill policy.” 
United States Oppresses Socialists


   “And America?” 


“It is hard to see clearly what is going on there. Your bankers seem
to fear us more than ever. At any rate, your Government is instituting more
violently repressive measures not only against the socialists but against
the working class in general than any other government, even the
reactionary French. Apparently it is persecuting foreigners. And yet, what
would America be without her foreign workers? They are an absolute
necessity to your economic development. 

“Still, some American manufacturers appear to have begun to realise
that making money in Russia is wiser than. making war against Russia, which
is a good sign. We shall need American manufactures- locomotives,
automobiles, etc.-more than those of any other country.” 
 


   “And your peace terms?” 


“It is idle to talk further about them,” Lenin returned
emphatically. “All the world knows that we are prepared to make peace on
terms the fairness of which even the most imperialistic capitalists could
not dispute. We have reiterated and reiterated our desire for peace, our
need for peace and our readiness to give foreign capital the most generous
concessions and guarantees. But we do not propose to be strangled to death
for the sake of peace. 

“I know of no reason why a socialistic commonwealth like ours cannot
do business indefinitely with capitalistic countries. We don’t mind taking
their capitalistic locomotives and farming machinery, so why should they
mind taking our socialistic wheat, flax and platinum. Socialistic corn
tastes the same as any other corn, does it not? Of course, they will have
to have business relations with the dreadful Bolsheviks-that is, the Soviet
Government. But it should not be harder for American steel manufacturers,
for instance, to deal with the Soviets than it was for them to deal with
Entente governments in their war-time munition deals.” 
Europe Dependent on Russia

“That is why this talk of reopening trade with Russia through
co-operatives seems to us insincere, or at least, obscure-a move in a game
of chess rather than a frank, straightforward proposition that would be
immediately grasped and acted upon. Moreover, if the Supreme Council really
means to lift the blockade, why doesn’t it tell us of its intentions? We
are without official word from Paris. What little we know is derived from
newspaper despatches picked up by our wireless. 

“The statesmen of the Entente and the United States do not seem to
understand that Russia’s present economic distress is simply a part of the
world’s economic distress. Until the economic problem is faced from a world
standpoint and not merely from the standpoint of certain nations or group
of nations, a solution is impossible. Without Russia, Europe cannot get on
her feet. And with Europe prostrate, America’s position becomes
critical. What good is America’s wealth if she cannot buy with it that
which she needs?

    

America cannot eat or wear the gold she has accumulated, can she? She can’t
trade profitably, that is, on a basis that will be of real value to her,
with Europe until Europe is able to give her the things she wants in
exchange for that which she has to give. And Europe cannot give her those
things until she is on her feet economically.” 
World Needs Russian Goods

“In Russia we have wheat, flax, platinum, potash and many minerals of
which the whole world stands in desperate need. The world must come to us
for them in the end, Bolshevism or no Bolshevism. There are signs that a
realisation of this truth is gradually awakening. But meanwhile not only
Russia but all Europe is going to pieces, and the Supreme Council still
indulges in

   tergiversation.[1]

Russia can be saved from utter ruin and Europe
too, but it must he done soon and quickly. And the Supreme Council is so
slow, so very slow. In fact, it has already been dissolved, I believe, in
favour of a Council of Ambassadors, leaving nothing settled and with only a
League of Nations which is nonexistent, still-born, to take its place. How
can the League of Nations possibly come to life without the United States
to give it backbone!” 


I inquired as to whether the Soviet Government was satisfied with the
   military situation. 


“Very much so,” Lenin replied promptly. “The only symptoms of
further military aggression against us are those I spoke of in Poland. If
Poland embarks on such an adventure there will be more suffering on both
sides, more lives needlessly sacrificed. But even Foch could not give the
Poles a victory. They could not defeat our Red Army even if Churchill
himself fought with them.” 


Here Lenin threw back his head and laughed grimly. Then he went on in a
   graver vein: 


“We can he crushed, of course, by any one of the big Allied Powers if
they can send their own armies against us. But that they dare not do. The
extraordinary paradox is that weak as Russia is compared with the Allies’
boundless

    

resources she has not only been able to shatter every armed force,
including British, American and French troops that they have managed to
send against her, but to win diplomatic and moral victories as well over
the cordon sanitaire countries. Finland refused to fight against us. We
have peace with Estonia, and peace with

Serbia[2]

and

Lithuania[4] is at hand. Despite material inducements offered to and
sinister threats made against these small countries by the Entente, they
preferred to establish pacific relations with us.” 
Internal Situation Hopeful

“This assuredly demonstrates the tremendous moral force we hold. The
Baltic states, our nearest neighbours, appreciate that we alone have no
designs against their independence and well-being.” 


   “And Russia’s internal situation?” 


“It is critical but hopeful. With spring the food shortage will be
overcome to the extent at least of saving the cities from famine. There
will be sufficient fuel then too. The reconstruction period is under way,
thanks to the Red Army’s stupendous performances. Now parts of that army
are transformed into armies of labour, an extraordinary phenomenon only
possible in a country struggling toward a high ideal. Certainly it could
not be done in capitalist countries. We have sacrificed everything to
victory over our armed antagonists in the past; and now we shall turn all
our strength to economic rehabilitation. It will take years, but we shall
win out in the end.” 


   “When do you think Communism will be complete in Russia?” The
   question was a poser, I thought, but Lenin replied immediately: 


“We mean to electrify our entire industrial system through power
stations in the Urals and elsewhere. Our engineers tell us it will take ten
years. When the electrification is accomplished it will be the first
important stage on the road to the communistic administration of public

    

economic life. All our industries will receive their motive power from a
common source, capable of supplying them all adequately. This will
eliminate wasteful competition in the quest of fuel, and place
manufacturing enterprise on a sound economic footing, without which we
cannot hope to achieve a full measure of interchange of essential products
in accordance with Communist principles. 

“Incidentally, in three years we expect to have 50,000,000
incandescent lamps burning in Russia. There are 70,000,000 in the United
States, I believe, but in a land where electricity is in its infancy more
than two-thirds of that number is a very high figure to
achieve. Electrification is to my mind the most momentous of the great
tasks that confront us.” 
Scores Socialist Leaders


At the close of our talk Lenin delivered himself, not for publication,
   however, of some cutting criticism of certain Socialist leaders in Europe
   and America which revealed his lack of faith in the ability or even desire
   of these gentry to promote world revolution effectively. He evidently
   feels that Bolshevism will come to pass in spite of, rather than because
   of, the “official” chieftains of Socialism.

This interview was given by Lenin in the middle of February 1920, at a
time when Soviet Russia, having gained a peaceful respite, was planning the
country’s economic rehabilitation and reconstruction, and when the Soviet
Government embarked on a broad programme for establishing diplomatic and
commercial relations with the capitalist countries. Lincoln Eyre of The
World was sent to Russia to obtain an interview from Lenin, and was
received by him in the company of cameraman Victor Kubes. The interview was
conducted in English, first in Lenin’s private office, then at his rooms in
the Kremlin. It lasted an hour and touched on questions of topical
interest. Lenin’s interview was published in The World and reprinted by
many newspapers in Western Europe and America.

nationalism,


but of counter-revolutionary and petty-bourgeois

This draft was adopted at the meeting of the C.P.C. on March 2, 1920,
during the discussion of Krasin’s report on the question of foreign
trade. It is connected with Point 17 of the theses on foreign trade,
reading: “A commission consisting of representatives from the Commissariat
for Foreign Trade, State Control and the Vecheka shall be set up to
ascertain and reserve the Republic’s stocks of commodities suitable for
foreign trade“ (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of

Remarks on the Draft
Re § 1 

a) Point I to be headed:

On Labour 

Enthusiasm.[1] The words “raising the will to work” in he
second line to be replaced by the words



“labour enthusiasm”. 

b) Add the principle establishing the strict responsibility of every
staff worker (board member, manager, director, etc.) for the performance of
a definite operation or job or task,

    

a principle generally recognised and endorsed by many economic council and
other meetings, should be persistently applied in practice without fail. Up
till now this is not by any means being sufficiently practised. 

c) The consumers—through the consumers’ societies, etc.—should be
systematically enlisted for control over production. 

d) The Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection should be encouraged to
greater participation in control over production and distribution. 

e) The fight against profiteering and red tape, as well as against
bureaucratism, should be highlighted. 

f) Every effort must be made to organise competition. Measures aimed at
improving discipline and raising labour efficiency should include cuts in
rations for offenders, etc. 

g) The end of § 4 of Trotsky’s text (nine last lines) should be
removed or toned down, or worded in a more general form. 

(These are my rough preliminary remarks.) 

Lenin 

3/111.

All work to improve the organisation and management of the
state farms should be centred on strongly combating, first, the patently
landowner-type abuses that have come to light in the application of money
rent, métayage, and so on; secondly, the extremely low labour
discipline and extremely low productivity of labour. 

Exact information to be demanded of the gubernia land departments and
state farms as to what measures they have taken in this direction and what
practical results they have achieved. Responsible persons to be appointed
answerable before a court of law for the carrying out of this decision and
the elimination of abuses. If need be, the entire managing personnel of the
worst farms should be replaced. Certain farms should be selected as
specialised model farms of a producing or purely consuming type and data
concerning the state of these farms to be recorded separately. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin proposed this draft at a meeting of the C.P.C. during a
discussion of the question of the state farms. The Council instructed
S. P. Sereda, People’s Commissar for Agriculture, “to submit the exact
text of all decisions on this question and the draft decision drawn up in
this connection”. The Draft Decision on Measures for State Farm
Organisation drawn up by the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture was
endorsed by the C.P.C. on April 15, 1920.

The Politbureau, composed of Bukharin, Krestinsky and
Lenin, discussed on 17.III.1920 the statement of the A.C.C.T.U. Party group
signed by Tomsky and Lutovinov and, found in their presence

1) that Comrade
Krestinsky, in private conversations with Comrades Ishchenko, Glebov,
Tomsky and Lutovinov, did not voice his misgivings about the awkwardness of
the existing relations (namely, the sponsoring by members of the Party at
non-Party congresses-and not at their communist groups-of resolutions that
differ from the resolution of the C.C. of the Party) in respect of the
decision passed by the C.C.


2) that Comrade Krestinsky had suggested that
this question should not be dealt with by the Party group before its
forthcoming discussion the next day at the Politbureau in the presence of
members of the Party group’s bureau;


3) that during these conversations’
Comrade Krestinsky had been rather hasty;


on the other hand,


that under the
circumstances the discussion of this question at the Party group was highly
out of place and bound to aggravate the conflict needlessly, or rather turn
the difference of opinion between the C.C. and the Party group into a real
conflict;


that the statement mentioned above is, in the eyes of every Party
man, not only hastiness, but squabbling of a decidedly unsavoury nature;


therefore the Politbureau resolves that the members of the A.C.C.T.U. Party
group bureau be asked


to have the Party group cancel its resolution and


consider the incident closed. 


The Politbureau, composed of comrades Bukharin, Lenin and Krestinsky,
discussed on 17.111.1920 the abnormal

    

situation arising from the fact that Party members sponsor resolutions at
non-Party congresses which run counter to the decisions of the Party’s
C.C. 

The Politbureau resolves that from the point of view of Party
discipline this is decidedly wrong and impermissible. 

Considering the quite exceptional circumstances, however (namely, the
very early date of the forthcoming Party congress, the publication of
Comrade Tomsky’s theses, and the comparatively minor importance of the
still moot question of collective management with or without one-man
management in separate cases) it is recognised as a politically lesser evil
that members of the A.C.C.T.U. Party group be permitted, pending the
decision of the Party congress, to sponsor the resolution of that group at
current congresses of the various trade unions. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At a joint meeting of the Party groups of the All-Russia Central
Council of Trade Unions and the Moscow C.T.U. on March 15, 1920,
N. N. Krestinsky, Secretary of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), declared that since
the stand taken by the A.C.C.T.U.’s Party Group and its responsible leaders
on the question of collective and one-man management differed sharply from
that of the Party’s Central Committee, he proposed in the name of the
Party’s C.C. that none of the group’s members should deliver reports at
trade union congresses in favour of collective management. 

Members of the group’s bureau, at a closed meeting,
emphatically protested against such interpretations and methods of
enforcing Party discipline and applied to the C.C. of the R.C,P. (B.)
asking to be allowed to move resolutions at trade union congresses on
behalf of the A.C.C.T.U.’s Party Group. Their statement was discussed at a
meeting of the C.C.’s Politbureau, which adopted Lenin’s draft resolutions.

Preface to the English Edition

The comrades who intend to publish my pamphlet against
Kautsky in English, which has also been published in

German,[3] have asked me to write a preface to the English
edition. 

I would prefer, in lieu of a short preface, to give a detailed analysis
of one of the writings of J. Ramsay Macdonald, who, as far as I know, is
one of the most influential and widely read of English writers of
practically the same Kautskyan trend. Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain
Macdonald’s book Parliament and

Revolution[4] which has short chapters on Soviet democracy and
Soviet suffrage,

    

but the author’s Kautskyan point of view is quite clear from his article
“Socialist Review Outlook” published in The Socialist Review, 
October-December 1919, of which he is the editor. Macdonald is not a
Marxist, and the Marxist-tinted opportunism characteristic of Kautsky is not
typical of England. 

As I have no time just now to give a detailed analysis of Macdonald’s
views, I shall confine myself to an attempt at briefly describing his views
as known to us from his political activities, from the newspaper of his
party (the “Independent” Labour Party-independent in word and fully
dependent on bourgeois prejudices in deed), from his magazine and. in
particular from the article just mentioned. 

I shall first quote some of the most characteristic passages from this
article: 


Describing the general political situation, Macdonald
   writes:

   “...Never was honest service and labour held in lower esteem”
   (p. 306).

   “.. Our ships of war continuing the starvation of women and children. We
   are in every mean and wicked conspiracy to subvert democracy in
   Europe. Though the State is tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, a
   Minister to gratify his personal vanity, and a small class of financiers
   to secure personal profit in the future, can add what will probably
   amount to 100,000,000 further burden upon the British taxpayer, for a
   Russian venture ...” (p. 307).

   “The storm in the teacup inside the Parliamentary Labour Party, because
   Mr. Neil Mac Lean remained seated during a theatrical display when the
   Prime Minister was being welcomed for bringing in his pocket from Paris
   one of the worst instruments that ever terminated a war, shows this same
   proneness

                      ?

   in the Party to be stampeded by trivial fears.”

   “The-Labour Party has to save itself from chastisement; it cannot allow
   handbills to be issued against its candidates, headed:

   ’The Labour Party condones an insult to our Gracious
   Sovereign.’”

 “Such a state of things,” declares brave Mr. Macdonald, “is not healthy;
   it contains no promise of great

     reform....”[1]


 

Notes

Here the manuscript breaks off.—Ed. 
 



[2]
Lenin did not finish his preface. The pamphlet The Proletarian
Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade came out in English at the end of
March 1920 without a preface. 



[3]
The German pamphlet N. Lenin. Die Diktatur des Proletariats und der
Renegat Karl Kautsky came out at the end of December1919. 



[4]
Lenin received Macdonald’s book later. It stands in his private library
with his marginal notes. Lenin specially marked those passages in the book
in which Macdonald tried to play down the class contradictions of
capitalist society. These marginal notes were published in Lenin
Miscellany  XXIV, pp. 253-85.

I. Aims And Purpose Of Subbotniks


  1) Subbotniks are a form of propaganda of the ideas of compulsory
  labour service and self-organisation of the working class.
 


  2) Subbotniks should be a laboratory of forms of communist
             labour.
+a) Higher labour productivity

  b) " work discipline


  3) Subbotniks must be started primarily for important and urgent
            jobs.
c) implementation of dictatorship of the proletariat

 4) Subbotniks should yield results not below established output
  rates, but participants should try to exceed these rates.
 d) leadership of the peasantry


   
 e) combating famine and economic chaos


 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The “Regulations on Subbotniks” were drafted by A. N. Sokolov, a
member of the staff of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.). They were
prepared, apparently, for the first anniversary of the launching of the
subbotniks (anniversary date May 10, 1920).

To Members of the Politbureau:  

Please read this. Interesting. I am for seeking a
compromise with

them.[1] 

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s note was written in connection with the decisions of the
Twelfth Conference of the Bund held April 42-19, 1920. The resolutions of
this conference with Lenin’s marks are to be found in the Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U. In the
resolution “On the. Present Situation and the Tasks of Our Party” Lenin
marked oil the following passage: 14. Summing up the experience of the last
year, the Twelfth Conference of the Bund finds: 1) that the Bund, in
principle, had adopted the communist platform since the Eleventh
Conference, 2) that the Programme of the Communist Party, which is also the
programme of the Soviet government, corresponds with the fundamental
platform of the Bund, 3) that a ’united socialist front’ with principled
opponents of Soviet power, who draw a line between the proletariat and its
government, is impossible, 4) that the moment has come when the Bund can
relinquish its official oppositional stand and take upon itself
responsibility for the Soviet government’s policy.” 

At the same time, the resolution on organisational
questions stated that “the logical consequence of the political stand
adopted by the Bund is the latter’s entry into the R.C.P on the same basis
as the Bund’s membership of the R.S.D.L.P. (underlined by Lenin). The
conference uthorised the C.C. of the Bund to see to it, as an essential
condition, that the Bund preserve within the R.C.P. the status of ,an
autonomous organisation of the Jewish proletariat” (marked off by
Lenin). 

On May 6, 1920, the Politbureau of the C.C.. R.C.P.(B.)
discussed the question of ,The Conditions for the Bund’s Admission to
Membership of the R.C.P.” and resolved: ,that Kamenay, Stalin and
Preobrazhensky be authorised to receive the representatives of the Bund and
hear their proposals” (Central Party Archives, Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.TJ.). 

At its Thirteenth Conference in 1921 the Bund decided
to dissolve itself, and part of its membership joined the B.C.P.(B.) on the
basis of the rules of admission.

1). Title to be changed. 

2) General public norm to be abolished. 

3) The work  ration, i.e., for number of days worked,
 to be made the basic ration. 

4) The work ration to be divided into categories according to the
lightness or heaviness of the work. 

5) 1st category: mental and office work 

6) 2nd “ manual work 

7) 3rd “ heavy work, etc. 

8) “Shock groups” (i.e., trades and enterprises of special importance
for production) transferable, by decision of the C. P.C. (sometimes by
special rules) and the Council of Defence, to categories 2, 3, and so
on. 

9) A special low norm to be fixed for non-working people, unemployed,
traders, etc. Exemptions. 

10) Special exemptions for children and the sick. 
2

Title suggestions: 

“Decree on Greater Uniformity of Food Rations and Work Rations As the
Basis of the Whole Food System” . 

What was formerly called “general public norm” to be changed
to 

“norm for unemployed and small proprietors” or: self-employed
citizens, people not working, etc. (or “small proprietors”), “people not
working in Soviet enterprises or offices“. 

Advantage: (1) simplifies things tremendously in capital cities and all
non-farming, industrial towns (as the bulk there work in Soviet
enterprises or Soviet offices). 

(2) In non-industrial  towns we clearly  set apart
the population that is not working in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices,
and this population should gradually be taken  off rations (either
start a vegetable garden of your own or go to work in Soviet enterprises or
Soviet offices). 
    



We shall not feed those who do not work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet
offices. 

Figure out under what system there will be less food coupons
and the system itself more simple.

V. I. Lenin delivered a short but impressive speech on
the significance of Karl Marx as a socialist leader. 

“The working people were enslaved, despite political liberties. Now
they are moving towards the workers’ revolution, which will create a
socialist society without landowners and capitalists. To Russia has fallen
the great honour and joy of helping to establish this socialist society and
a world Soviet Republic. Today, on this international festival of labour,
when we wish to prove to everybody that we shall succeed in coping with the
task of organising a socialist society of the working people, we honour the
memory of Karl Marx. And I am confident that the laying of this monument to
our great teacher will serve as a call impelling us to give all our
attention to the need for working hard and long to create a society in
which there will be no room for exploitation.”

Comrade Lenin devoted his short speech to reminiscences of
Comrade Zagorsky, whom he had met abroad, where the deceased had lived as a
political emigrant in 1907 and when Lenin visited the workers’ circles of
comrades living abroad and circles of Russian emigrants to read lectures
and reports. Already in those days Comrade Zagorsky, who was secretary of
the Geneva group of Bolsheviks, impressed one as being an energetic, clever
man and a good organiser devoted heart and soul to the cause of the
Party. When Zagorsky returned to Moscow in 1918 he threw himself into Party
work and was shortly elected secretary of the Moscow organisation, at which
honourable post he died during the explosion in Leontievsky

Pereulok.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a bomb explosion in the building of the Moscow Committee
of the Party in Leontievsky Pereulok. The bomb was thrown by Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries on September 25, 1919.

In a speech to the newly promoted Red commanders Lenin
spoke about the things a Red commander should know when going out to the
Western Front. A Red commander should remember that we were fighting, not
the Polish workers and peasants, but the Polish bourgeoisie and landowners,
as well as the capitalists of the Entente who

    

stood behind them and controlled the Polish landed gentry. You know,
Comrade Lenin said, that this war has been forced on us against our desire,
but we are not going to let ourselves be crushed: better death than
defeat.

He did not wait for our question, but started to speak of
the relations between Japan and Russia-to the effect that it is regrettable
that Japan does not seem willing to adopt an attitude of willingness to
meet the Soviet Government’s attitude of peace. The Soviet Government
stands for peace, and therefore it recognises the neutral zone

government.[2] 

He then asked: “Is there a powerful landowning class in Japan? Does
the Japanese farmer own land freely? Do the Japanese people live on food
produced in their own country, or do they import much food from foreign
countries?” He asked many other questions, showing his deep interest in
living conditions in Japan. 

Mr. Lenin next asked whether Japanese parents beat their children, and
said he had read of this in a book. “Tell me whether it is true or not,”
said he, “it is a very interesting subject.” I answered that there may be
exceptions, but as a rule parents do not beat their children in Japan. On
hearing my answer he expressed satisfaction and said that the policy of the
Soviet Government is to abolish this condition. After that we asked about
the revolution and subsequent developments. 

In giving a résumé of Russian revolutionary history, he said:
“Before the revolution, the working and peasant classes of Russia were
extremely oppressed-in fact, their oppression was without parallel in past
history. As a result of this most severe oppression, the revolutionary
spirit of the poorer class gradually increased until it broke out in the
revolution. But the organising capacity of the lower strata of Russia is
comparatively weak and the degree of education lower than in any other
countries. In spite of all this they could not be suppressed. But now,
after two and a half years of experience, the Russian working and peasant
masses have obtained a great deal of political and social discipline. The
experience of this two and a half years can truly be compared with the
development of several centuries.”  
 

At this point we asked why the Soviet Republic, in spite of its having
repudiated the national debts of czarism, had promised to give Esthonia
vast amounts of gold, when concluding peace. Smiling, Mr. Lenin said:
“Esthonia has shown her good will toward the Soviet Government and
therefore the Soviet Government has promised to pay her this
gold. Moreover,” he continued, “to deal with the propertied class is
really a very difficult matter. The propertied class cares for nothing but
its own material, interests. For instance, look at America. America
proposed a peace treaty with Soviet Russia. When we examined the treaty, we
could not accept. it because it was based on exploitation. So we rejected
it. Of course we do not consider ourselves incapable. The Allied nations,
rejecting recognition, attempt to interfere with Russia. There is reason to
think that if the intervention of the Allies should continue, it will be
profitable to the Boisheviki. 

“All in all, considering the prospects of Russia’s industries, the
situation is promising. If our electrical programme, is attained entire
industries can be electrified. The creative capacity of communism will be
increased and will exert the greatest influence in solving these problems,
and the development will be equal to that of several decades.”  
 

Notes

This interview took place in Lenin’s private office in the Kremlin on
June 3, 1920. Writing from Moscow, Nakahira reported: “I interviewed
Mr. Lenin at his office in the Kremlin. Contrary to my expectation, the
decoration of the room is very simple. Mr. Lenin’s manner is very simple
and kind—as if he were greeting an old friend. In spite of the fact that
he holds the highest position, there is not the slightest trace of
condescension in his manner.” (Osaka Asahi No. 13814 for June 13,
1920.) The next day, as Nakahra mentions in his later reminiscences, he
brought the text of his interview to Lenin, who read it carefully and made
several corrections. 

Lenin’s interview given to another Japanese
correspondent, K. Fussa, and printed lower down, took place on June 3 or
4. Possibly both correspondents were received by Lenin together. Fusse says
the interview lasted about twenty minutes. A. N. Vorneseasky, Chief of the
Eastern Department of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, was
present at the interview. 

Fusse’s interview with Lenin was reported on Jun, 26,
1920, in the Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper Volya pub!thed in
Vladivostok. The text of the interview given in this volume was first
published in Russian in 1924 in the collection of articles Lenin i
Vostok (Lenin and the East) and afterwards in the First Edition of
Lenin’s Collected Works (Vol. XX, Part II). It was not included in the 2nd,
3rd and 4th (Russian) editions of the Collected Works. 



[2]
This refers to the Far-Eastern Republic set up in April 1920 on the
territory of the Trans-Baikal, Amur, Maritime and Kernchatka regions and
Northern Sakhalin. In form a bourgeois-democratic state, in essence it
pursued a Soviet policy in keeping with the interests of Soviet Russia,
which needed a prolonged respite on her Eastern Front and wanted to stave
off war with Japan. At the same time, the creation of a buffer state in the
Far East was made necessary by force of circumstances. As Lenin pointed
out, “circumstances made necessary the creation of a buffer state, the
Far-Eastern Republic. We are well aware of the unbelievable sufferings that
the Siberian peasants are enduring at the hands of the Japanese
imperialists and the atrocities the Japanese have committed in Siberia.”
(present edition, Volume 31, page 465). 

After the interventionists and whiteguards were driven
out of the Soviet Far East (except Northern Sakhalin), the People’s
Assembly of the Far-Eastern Republic voted for entry into the R.S.F.S.R. on
November 14, 1922.

Lenin said on meeting Fusse that he was very glad to see him
and that despite everything that had taken place in recent years between
Russia and Japan and the fact that

    

some people in Japan still took an uncompromising attitude towards
Soviet Russia, he nevertheless took an optimistic view of future relations
between the two countries. The Soviet Government had recognised the
independence of the buffer state and “this, I hope,” said
Lenin, “would help restore peace in the Far East in the very near
future.” 


Fusse started the interview by asking Lenin: “Last autumn you
   said the difficulties were over. Don’t you foresee big difficulties ahead?"
   


I meant that our greatest difficulties were over; but, of course, there
are still many difficulties confronting us. 


Fusse: “You said it took capitalism many years to accomplish
   the transition from feudalism, therefore it would also take socialism many
   years to accomplish the transition from capitalism.  Approximately how long
   do you think this will take?" 


Generally, it is hard to fix dates; to overthrow the old order doesn’t
require much time, but you can’t create the new order in a short time. We
have launched our plan for the electrification of industry and agriculture;
without electrification the communist order is impracticable, and our plan
of electrification is designed for a period of ten years under the most
favourable conditions. That’s the shortest time we set for building up our
new order. 


Lenin then asked Fusse a number of questions concerning agrarian and
   class relations in Japan. 


What kind of landowners does Japan have? What is the position of the
landless peasant in Japan? Are there any peasant organisations? and so on.
Lenin also showed an interest in the state of electrification and public
education in Japan and how children were treated in Japan. When Fusse said
that Japan took better care of her children than the West, Lenin remarked:
“That’s very important, in view of the fact that the practice of beating
children in the schools has not yet been entirely eliminated in the
so-called civilised countries of Europe, not even in a country like
Switzerland..” 


After this Fusse again asked Lenin a number of political
   questions. 

Fusse: do you visualise good-neighbourly relations between
   socialist and capitalist states?” 

Our terms of coexistence with capitalist countries were set forth at
length in the draft treaty which the American

    

representative, Mr. Bullitt, recently published in Washington. These terms
were most unfavourable to us, and it was this that led the Allied
governments to believe that our willingness to make concessions was a sign
of weakness, and they started their intervention, as a result of which they
suffered complete defeat. We routed Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin, 


Fusse: “Where does communism have more chance of success-in -the West
   or in the East?” 


So far, real communism can succeed only in the West, but it must be
remembered that the West lives at the expense of the East; the imperialist
powers of Europe grow rich chiefly at the expense of the eastern colonies,
but at the same time they are arming their colonies and teaching them to
fight, and by so doing the West is digging its own grave in the East. 


Fusse: “What are the immediate tasks of the Soviet
   Government?” 


First, to beat the Polish landowners, second, to secure a lasting
peace, and then, third, to develop our economic life.

In a statement signed by Comrades Belenky, Ivanichev and
Gabalin it has been established that by order of the Manager of the
Sanatorium, Comrade Vever, a perfectly sound fir-tree was cut down in the
sanatorium’s park on June 14, 1920. 
 

For causing damage to Soviet property I order Comrade Vever, Manager of
the Sanatorium at the Soviet Gorki Estate, to be placed under arrest for 1
month. 

Sentence to be executed by the Podolsk Uyezd Executive Committee on the
understanding that 

(1) should it be discovered that Comrade Vever had had no penalties
previously imposed upon him, his sentence shall be suspended after a week’s
detention and he shall be warned that in the event of wrongful felling in
the park, walks or woods or any other damage to Soviet property being
allowed, he will be liable to further punishment over and above 3 weeks’
arrest and to dismissal. 

(2) The date on which sentence is to be carried out shall be
determined by the Uyezd Executive Committee by arrangement with the Uyezd
Land Department or the Management of the State Farms to ensure that farm
work will not suffer in any way. 

I instruct Comrade Belenky to bring this decision to the notice of
Comrade Vever and his assistants, who are to sign that it has been
announced to them and that any further similar offence will incur
punishment for all workers and office staff, and not the manager
alone. 

I instruct the Uyezd Executive Committee to report to me what date they
have fixed for the arrest and how the sentence has been carried out.

Comrade Lenin put the question this way: what, in effect,
does it mean to recognise the dictatorship of the proletariat. It means
every day, in propaganda, agitation,

    

speeches and articles, to prepare the proletariat for the conquest of
power, for the suppression of the exploiters, the suppression of all the
proletariat’s opponents. Comrade Lenin, on the basis of various
documents and newspapers, showed what a gulf existed between the Third
International and the entire policy of the French

Party.[1] He revealed all the rottenness of the Turatian wing of the
Italian Party, which was preventing the party from adopting a correct
line.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The reference is to the French Socialist
Party.

At the outbreak of the imperialist world war the
Party’s reformist leadership adopted a social-chauvinist stand of
open support of the imperialist war and participation in the bourgeois
government. There was a Centrist trend in the Party headed by Joan Longuet,
which took a social-pacifist stand and pursued a policy of conciliation
with the social-chauvinists. There was also a Left, revolutionary wing in
the Party which took an internationalist stand and was represented chiefly
by its rank and file. 

After the October Socialist Revolution a sharp struggle
developed within the Party between the open reformists and Centrists on the
one hand, and the Left, revolutionary wing, on the other-the latter
strengthened by rank-and-file workers who joined the Party en masse. At the
Party’s congress in Tours in December 1920 the revolutionary wing
received a majority. The congress adopted a decision for the Party to join
the Communist International and founded the Communist Party of France. The
majority of reformists and Centrists broke away from the Party and formed a
separate party, retaining the old name of French Socialist Party.

The theses and draft to be endorsed as a whole, but both to
be amended in the direction of 

(1) equalising land tenure of Russians and newcomers with that of local
people; 

(2) overcoming, ousting and subordinating Russian kulaks in the most
energetic manner; 

(3) not giving the Turkestan

Commission[2] the right to alter decrees without obtaining the consent
of the Turkestan Central Executive Committee and the Turkestan Council of
People’s Commissars and without consulting the centre; 

(4) systematically considering, preparing and carrying out the transfer
of power-gradually but steadily-to the local


Soviets of working people,

under the control of reliable Communists; 

(5) the question of dividing the Republic into 3 parts not to be
decided beforehand; 

(6) the general task to be, not communism, but the overthrow of
feudalism.

Lenin’s draft was adopted with slight amendments at a meeting of the
Politbureau of the C.C. on June 22, 1920, at which the theses and draft
resolution on the Turkestan Republic drawn up by a special commission were
discussed. For this commission’s draft with Lenin’s remarks see Lenin’s
Collected Works, Vol. 41, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 433-36. 



[2]
The Turkestan Commission of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
and the Council of People’s Commissars of the R.S.F,S.R, was set up on
October 8, 1919. Its members were G. I. Boky, F. I. Goloshchokin,
V. V. Kuibyshev, Y. E. Rud-zutak, M. V. Frunze and S. Z. Eliava. The
commission was vested with the powers of a Government and Party body and
was sent to Turkestan to give all possible aid to the local Commu-nists and
the working people of Turkestan in overcoming that country’s political,
economic and cultural backwardness, eonsolidating Soviet power and
strengthening the union between the peoples of Turkestan and Soviet
Russia. One o the commis-sion’s tasks was to correct mistakes made during
the implemen-tation of the national policy in Turkestan. 

The Turkestan Commission carried out a number of
measures for strengthening the local Party organisations and combating
dominant-nation chauvinism and local nationalism. Important issues were
those concerning the principles of Turkestan auto- nomy, relations with the
federal bodies, and the forms and methods of Party organisation.

[1]
The Second Congress of the Communist International, which laid
the foundations of the Comintern’s programme, tactics and organisation was
held from July 19 to August 7, 1920, in Soviet Russia. The opening session
was held in Petrograd and the subsequent sessions, beginning with July 23,
in Moscow. The congress was attended by 169 voting delegates and 49
delegates with a consultative voice representing 67 workers’ organisations
of 37 countries. Apart from delegates representing the Communist Parties
and organisations of 31 countries, there were delegates from the
Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, the socialist parties of
Italy and France, Industrial Workers of the World (Australia, Britain and
Ireland), the National Confederation of Labour of Spain and other
organisations. The R,C.P.(B.) was represented at the congress by 64
delegates. 

All the preparatory work for convening the congress was
directed by Lenin, who attached great importance to this international
congress of communist and workers’ organisations. An important role in
defining the tasks and working out the political line of the Comintern was
played by Lenin’s book “Left-Wing” Communism-an Infantile Disorder,
written for the opening of the Second Congress. Lenin wrote the
“Preliminary Draft Th(Ç,ses on the National and Colonial Questions
(For the Second Congress of the Communist International)”, “Preliminary
Draft Theses on the Agrarian Question (For the Second Congress of the
Communist International)”, “Theses on the Fundamental Tasks of the Second
Congress of the Communist International” and “The Terms of Admission into
the Communist International” (see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 144-51,
152-64, 184-201, 206-11). 

The congress adopted the following agenda: 1) The
International Situation and the Fundamental Tasks of the Communist
International; 2) The Role and Composition of the Communist Parties Before
and After the Conquest of Power by the Proletariat; 3) The Trade Unions and
the Factory Committees; 4) the Question of Parliamentarism; 5) The National
and Colonial Questions; 6) The Agrarian Question; 7) The Attitude to the
New “Centrist” Trends and Terms of Admission Into the Communist
International; 8) The Charter of the Communist International; 9)
Organisational questions (legal and illegal organisations, women’s
organisations, etc.); 10) The Communist youth movement; 11) Elections; ’12)
Miscellaneous. 

At the opening session of the congress Lenin delivered
a report on the international situation and the fundamental tasks of the
Communist International (see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 215-34). 

Lenin took an active part in the work of most of the
committees-those on the national and colonial questions, on the agrarian
question, on terms of admission into the Communist International, and on
the international situation and the tasks of the Comintern. 

Lenin also made a speech at the congress on the role of
the Communist Party, delivered a report of the Committee on the National
and Colonial Questions, speeches on the terms of admission into the
Communist International, on parliamentarianism and on affiliation to the
British Labour Party (ibid., pp. 235-63). The congress adopted Lenin’s
theses as a resolution, passed a resolution “On the Role of the Communist
Party in the Proletarian Revolution”, in the formulation of which Lenin
took an active part, and adopted other resolutions, the “Terms of
Admission Into the Communist International” and the Charter of the
Comintern. The congress also adopted the Manifesto of the Second Congress
of the Communist International. In addition it published a number of
appeals: “The Third International to the Trade Unions of All Countries”,
“To the Workers of Petrograd”, “To the Red Army and Red Navy of the
R.S.F.S.R.”, “Against the Executioners of Hungary”, “To the Proletarian
Men and Women of All Countries”, and others. 

The Second Congress of the Comintern played a
tremendous role in the development of the international communist movement
After the congress Lenin pointed out that “communism has become the
central to the working-class movement as a whole” (see present edition,
Vol. 32, p. 180).

2) Badayev to be rehabilitated (through the Orgbureau). 

3) A number of Petrograd food workers to be transferred to Moscow. 

4) Petrograd to be placed under very strict supervision. [Points 2 and 4 in the manuscript are crossed out. Point 4

5) Petrograd, Moscow and all other food points to be put on, an equal
footing in the distribution of bread and norms of

issue.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The conflict between the Petrograd United Consumers’ Commune and the
Petrograd Soviet was this. In the summer of 1920 a number of functionaries
of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet headed by G. Zinoviev
and the Petrograd Trade Union Council raised the question of issuing bread
rations to workers not only for actual work days but also for holidays and
non-working days. The Board of the Petrograd Commune (A. Y. Badayev and
others) were opposed to this on the grounds that such an extra issue would
violate the very principle on which the work ration was based and that,
besides, the necessary supplies for this were lacking; in general, it might
upset the regular issue of the work ration and shake the workers’ trust in
the food supply system. The Petrograd Soviet, however, ignored the opinion
of the Petrograd Commune Board and announced the issue of rations for
holidays. Badayev refused to carry out this order and declared that the
Board of the Petrograd Commune could not work under such conditions. On
July 5, 1920, the Petrograd Gubernia Committee of the A.C.P.(B.), having
discussed “Comrade Badayev’s refusal to accept the decision of the Large
Presidium of June 23 providing for an increase in the bread ration, the
issue of 5 lb. advance and the issue of rations to workers during
holidays” resolved: “1. That all district bureaux and all functionaries
of the Petrograd Commune shall be ordered to remain at work and discharge
their duties without the slightest hitch until further notice from the
Petrograd Party Committee and the Executive Committee. 2. That it be deemed
necessary to radically change the personnel of the Petrograd Commune Board
and instruct the Bureau of the Gubernia Committee together with the
Presidium of the Executive Committee to appoint new comrades through the
medium of the Control Council of the Petrograd Commune and to get in touch
with Moscow on this question pending the convocation of a city conference
of factory committees and unions” (Party Archives of the Party History
Institute of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the C.P.S.U.). 



[2]
The conflict between the Petrograd Commune and the Petrograd Soviet was
discussed at a plenary meeting of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on July 16, 1920, at
which Lenin wrote his draft decision. Lenin’s motion was adopted. Taking
into consideration that the existing relations between the functionaries of
the Petrograd Commune and the Petrograd Soviet were likely to lead to
further conflicts, the CC. resolved to have A. Badayev and a number of
other Petrograd Commune workers transferred to Moscow. Badayev was
appointed Chairman of the Moscow Consumers’ Society.

[1]
Lenin wrote these answers on a telegram dated July 17, 1920, from
A. M. Krasnoshchokov, Foreign Minister of the Far-Eastern Republic and
member of the Far-Eastern Bureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) in which he
reported the signing of an armistice agreement with Japan on July 15. A
special protocol signed by the representatives of the F.-E.R. and Japan
stated that the best way of establishing peace in the Far East was the
creation of a buffer state based on democratic principles, under a single
government to be formed at a conference attended by representatives from
all the regions of the territory. It was in connection with this conference
that Krasnoshchokov asked Lenin for urgent replies to the questions raised
in his telegram. 



[2]
The Four-pointer—abbreviated name for the democratic
four-point electoral system, namely: universal, equal and direct suffrage
and secret ballot. 



[3]
This probably means securing a majority for Communists in democratic
state institutions.

Comrades, in all countries communist leaders are suffering
unimaginable sacrifices. They are dying by the thousand in Finland and
Hungary and other countries. But no persecutions can arrest the growth of
communism,

  

and the heroism of fighters like Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg gives
us courage and faith in the complete victory of communism, (Comrade
Lenin’s speech was drowned in thunderous cheers. The
“Internationale” was sung.) 

 

Notes
 
 



[1] This speech was delivered at a meeting of thousands of people on
Uritsky Square (formerly Palace Square) on the evening of July 19, after
the termination of the first sitting of the Second Congress of the
Communist International.

I move the following resolution by a collection of
signatures in the Politbureau: 

The Politbureau of the C.C. considers the publication in
No. 12 of the Communist International


of Gorky’s

articles extremely inappropriate, especially the editorial,



as there is not only nothing communist about these articles, but a
good deal that is


anti-communist in them. In future


such articles must


on no account be

published



in the Communist International. 

Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The draft is signed also by L.D. Trotsky, N. N. Krestinsky and
M.I. Kalinin.—Ed. 
 



[2]
This refers to Maxim Gorky’s article “Vladimir Ilyich Lenin" published
as an editorial in the journal The Communist International No. 12,
1920, and Gorky’s letter to H. G. Wells published in the same issue. 

Both the article and the letter, though inspired by
genuine affection for Lenin and admiration for his activities, were written
from erroneous positions of the personality cult and contained a number of
politically harmful theses. Gorky gave extremely subjective and virtually
idealist appraisals of the role of Lenin and the Russian people, and the
nature of the revolution in Russia. He overlooked the leading role
of the Communist Party, the decisive role of the working class and the
peasantry in the revolution. 

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau of the
C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on July 31, 1920. 

The Communist International, organ of the Executive
Committee of the Communist International, was published in Russian, German,
French, English, Spanish and Chinese. The first issue appeared onMay 1,
1919. 

The journal published theoretical articles and
documents of the Comintern and a number of articles by Lenin (“The Third
International and Its Place in History”, The Tasks of the Third
International”, “Ramsay MacDonald on the Third International”,
“Greetings to Italian, French and German Communists”, “The Constituent
Assembly Elections and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”, “Notes of a
Publicist" and others). All member Parties of the Comintern were
represented on the journal’s edi torial board. The journal dealt
with the fundamental questions of Marxist-Leninist theory bearing on the
problems of the inter-national labour and communist movements and the
experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. It quickly became
a mouthpiece for the Stalin faction of the Communist Party, supporting all
the zig-zags of the Comintern during the 30s and 40s. Publication finally
ceased in June 1943 following the decision by the Presidium of the
Comintern’s Executive on May 15, 1943, dissolving the Communist
International.

It having been certified that there remain (with Budyonny)
not <10,000, 


1) I vote for taking the 6th Cavalry Division from Budyonny
for the Wrangel front; 
 

2) for reinforcing Budyonny’s Mounted Army with those 3-4
thousand sabres which the Commander-in-Chief promises the South
(urgent); 

+4) more horses to be taken from the Byelorussian peasants

Notes
 
 



[1]
The situation on the Polish and Wrangel fronts was discussed at a
meeting of the Politbureau on. August 19, 1920. The Wrangel front was found
to be the main front, and the Politbureau out-lined a number of measures
aimed at strengthening it, speci-fically, it passed a decision to transfer
the 6th Division of the First Mounted Army to the Wrangel front. 

On August 20, 1920, the Commander-in-Chief forwarded a
memorandum to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic objecting
to this transfer on the grounds that the 6th Division formed the core of
the First Mounted Army and in quality was equal to the three remaining
divisions. The memorandum bears I. V. Stalin’s superscription: “This
information is incorrect: the remaining three divisions have
no less than 10,000 sabres, and the 4th Cavalry Division remaining
in the Mounted Army is older and more indigenous than the 6th”.  On
reading this memorandum Lenin wrote his proposals. Lenin made the following
notes, apparently during the discussion of these proposals: under points I
and 2 “Krestinsky against”, under point 4 “Krestinsky abstained”, and
under point 5 “Krestinsky is for”. The numeration of the points has been
retained as given in the manuscript.

The Politbureau rules that the action of Comrades
Tukhachevsky and Smilga be severely censured. They had no right to issue
their worse than tactless order, which undermines the policy of the Party
and the

     Government.[1]


The Politbureau directs the R.M.C. of the Republic to
immediately rescind the order of the R.M.C. of the Western Front and to
reprimand the latter for their irregular

       action.[2]

Notes
 

[1]
By a note written at the top of the document Lenin instructed his
secretary to have this decision telegraphed to the R.M.C. of the Western
Front: “Brichkina, send this off by wire.” Under the text of the
decision he wrote: “Copies for Comrades Chicherin and
Danishevsky.”—Ed. 

[2]
This text was marked off by Lenin with a pencil and a note added:
“Sklyansky has already been told.”—Ed. 
 



[3]
This refers to Order No. 1847 dated August 20, 1920, of the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front, which stated that the
Polish peace delegation consisted entirely of spies and secret service
agents and that peace could only be concluded “on the ruins of White
Poland”. 



[4]
On August 23, 1920, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic
rescinded the order of the R.M.C. of the Western Front and reprimanded the
latter for their irregular action, Simultaneously K. Danishevsky, head of
the Soviet delegation conducting negotiations with Poland, was directed, in
the event of the Polish delegation not feeling satisfied with the
explanation already given to the delegation at its meeting, to bring to the
notice of this delegation the order of the Revolutionary Military Council
of the Republic countermanding that of the R.M.C. of the Western
Front.

 I
Speech on the Immediate Tasks of Party
          Development. September 24

Comrades, I think that certain statements made during the
debates and even certain speeches are worth mentioning if only because they
obviously express not just overstrain, but overstrain bordering on hysteria
and therefore giving a misplaced emphasis. I would not call it demagogy. It
is physical overstrain to the point of hysteria. This applies mainly to the
speeches by Lutovinov and Bubnov, in which there was less of
demagogy than of overstrain. To some extent I think there were signs of
overstrain in Medvedev’s statement too. He said: “Now you have all started
speaking about unhealthy symptoms, but before you used to deny it, you
weren’t telling the truth.” I think this explanation is not quite
correct, in fact it is quite incorrect. That the unhealthy
symptoms we are talking about really exist-was hardly a secret.  Without a
doubt, the general situation was so grave that we couldn’t find time till
now for the Party, we had no chance to raise this question specially in the
Party. Even now we raise it with difficulty, because the chance we are
discussing here in our political talk-the chance of our being able to avoid
a winter campaign-is extremely slender. The general situation of the
Republic, as I mentioned, has improved to such an extent that we are now
able to discuss things more calmly: there is no longer any question of
suspending the conference the way we did several times when Kolchak and,
Denikin were advancing. There were Party congresses from which a number of
leading workers went straight off to the front without waiting for them to
end. Mind you, we seldom convene congresses, we seldom have a chance of
discussing important issues at congresses-yet before we couldn’t even see a
congress through to the end, rarely though it was convened.

    

Today at any rate we can and ought to thresh things out without
restricting ourselves. I should also like to say a word about
Kalinin’s attempts to present the case in a Marxist way. It seems to
me that his arguments were a long step away from Marxism, and the correct
Marxist view I think was given in the resolution of the Moscow
Committee—which you have all, of course, read and which has been put out
in a small pamphlet and printed in Pravda—and the letter of the Central
Committee. 

I should like to read out several lines, which I would offer to the
committee (if it be decided to set one up), not in lieu of the Moscow
resolution and the C.C.’s letter, but as supplementary material to

them.[1]

The resolution of the Moscow Committee I think-and all are agreed on
this-deals with the question correctly. Allow me to quote those few words
and dwell on them briefly.  Here is the addendum: “The indescribably grave
position of the Soviet Republic in the early years of its existence,
extreme devastation and grave military danger, made it necessary to
designate special “shock” (and therefore virtually privileged)
departments and groups of workers.  This was unavoidable, since the ruined
country could not be saved unless resources and energies were concentrated
on such departments and such groups of workers, without the strengthening
of which the imperialists of the whole world would have certainly crushed
us and prevented the Soviet Republic from even starting on economic
construction ....” 

As regards the old specialists we have heard some very heated attacks
here. The truth came out in Comrade Kutuzov’s speech when he said
that the proletariat saw no improvement of its position from Soviet
Russia–if anything, it was often worse. That’s true. But one must sort out
the facts-for instance, that in Vienna, where there is no Soviet
government, you have the same deterioration, to which you can add a moral
humiliation a hundred times worse. But the rank and file cannot get this
straight. Understand-ably, we are asked: What did we get in the course of
these two years? And obviously, dissatisfaction with the old

    

specialists is widespread. Naturally, the question whether we need
specialists or not was a salient issue. We shouldn’t forget, however, that
without them we would not have had our army. We would have found ourselves
in the same position as Hungary and the Finnish workers. That is how the
matter stands.  Without these specialists—I spoke about this in my
political report—we would not have been able to take those elementary steps
that helped us rise to a definite level. If we had failed to cope with this
specialist business, we would not have had this, we would not have been
able to make further progress. But now, when we have taken them in hand and
harnessed them, when we know that they will not run away from us, but, on
the contrary, are all running to join us, we shall now be sure that
democratisation in the Party and the army will rise. I shall read further
(reads the resolution) .... 

Point one

  (reads).[2]

Here there is an addition. Comrade Tomsky said, referring to what we have
often spoken about ourselves, that the rank and file should be brought to
the fore, the leaders are tired, give the rank and file a chance. This
could not be done at once, but it will be after another, maybe the
twentieth, attempt. Failing this, Soviet Russia’s cause would be
hopeless. But we know that it is not hopeless, because we have new elements
that are growing up. If the first attempts failed, we shall try and try
again. 
Point two



  (reads).[3]

Here a rather sarcastic question was asked as to whether freedom of
criticism would correspond to freedom to eat

peaches.[8] I have one measure as a possible guarantee, on the basis
of the proposals made by the committee. At moments when the country is in
danger, when Kolchak reached the Volga and Denikin Orel, there can be no
freedoms. There are other things than this to be regretted. But the
military situation is bad now, too, we see how fickle the fortunes of war
are. We must put this question on the order of the day.  But we cannot, we
must not, promise that at moments of military danger we shall not act
differently. We shall have to make a tremendous

    

effort again and no arguing about it, we shall have to stand firm, strain
every nerve.  We do not renounce this at all, and until we have an Italian
victory we must not renounce it. And that’s my reply to the peaches. 
Point three

  (reads).[4]

Here Comrade Preobrazhensky raised a question which Zinoviev raised too: Is
regulation appropriate here and what is to be understood by it? I shall
leave this question open, as it will be detailed in the committee. We shall
see whether regulation is to be understood as detailed points or as the
setting up of special bodies. 
Point four



  (reads).[5]

The speaker here said that this question had been raised by the committee
but was rejected by its majority. I believe—I am putting this forward only
in my own name—I believe that it should not be rejected, and if not
accepted at once, at least it should first be considered. It has been
pointed out here that 500 complaints have accumulated in the Orgbureau of
the C.C. The Orgbureau has to distribute tens of thousands of
people. Besides, there is not a single member of the Orgbureau who is not
swamped with work, doing several jobs. Under these conditions one has to
work with unknown quantities, and under such conditions you can only decide
questions by intuition, a thing only experienced people can do, and even
they often make mistakes. Taking into consideration these conditions, we
want to find people with a length of Party membership of not less than
fifteen years, who enjoy the Party’s trust, who are unbiassed, and who
would help in this business, while at the same time standing above the
Orgbureau as regards independence, as they would be elected by the
congress. I believe this step could be taken. To hamper the C.C.’s work or
hold up the decision is impossible. There is no special provision for it,
and we cannot offer it. There used to be a control commission in the German
Workers’ Party. How far that will be possible in our war situation—one
cannot say. In any case we are in a position to take such a step, and the
C.C. has taken that course. 
The C.C.’s letter says:

“Special Party commissions to handle relevant complaints should be
organised at all

    

Gubernia Party Committees and made up of the most dispassionate comrades
enjoying the general trust of the organisation.” It speaks here of
dispassionate comrades. For real militant activities—military, economic
and organisational—passionate people are very often absolutely necessary,
because without high passion they will not be able to work at high
pressure, they will not solve the urgent problem facing the exhausted
country. On the contrary, what we need here are people, who though they may
not possess conspicuous administrative abilities, have a good knowledge of
life. I doubt whether we shall be able to find enough of them for the whole
of Russia, for all gubernias, and if the commissions which are now going to
be set up and which you will set up under the Gubernia Party Committees
prove to be unsuccessful, don’t draw the conclusion that the whole
enterprise is a failure. We may not find a sufficient number of comrades in
the gubernias capable of holding out from congress to congress. If we don’t
find them in the gubernias, we shall find staunch comrades with a knowledge
of life in the centre. I think we should not give up the idea of forming
these bodies. 

It may be said: Where is the guarantee that these bodies can exist? We
are in a state of desperate civil war, where, generally speaking, there can
be no question of any freedom of broad criticism and so forth. We have
other things to think of, we must strain every effort to end the war. If
the conditions of war were not what they are, the position would be
different. Under the present conditions we cannot provide for a good many
things; and we say straight out that in order to settle this question in a
practical manner we cannot rely on the C.C., because it is swamped with
work as it is. I doubt whether you will find a single C.C. member—I judge
from my own experience—who doesn’t feel over head and heels in debt as
regards unfinished or skimped jobs. I can imagine no more effective
guarantee of this plan being carried out than the creation of this
commission, of a group of comrades capable of concentrating wholly on this
job with the assurance that it will be entirely independent, handling
affairs which no single member of the C.C., the Orgbureau, or the
Politbureau is in a position to go into with any thoroughness. We may have
a practical grasp of things, seeing

    

that we are making some progress, that we have increased our grain
collections from 60 to 260 million poods-but this proved insufficient to
give us a Red Army that was not overexhausted, to give us workers who did
not say, “What good has the Red Army done us, we are starving”, and to
give us a leadership that was not utterly worn out and does not stand in
need of help from the rank and file.  Nevertheless, we did make that
progress, and that means that even in such a mass state of extreme fatigue
the scale of this fatigue is beginning to diminish and we are entering a
period when we can stop discussing the crust-of-bread question and pass on
to weightier problems confronting us, which we all shall most certainly
tackle.

Draft Resolution on the Immediate Tasks of Party
     Development

Not in lieu of, but as supplementary material to the C.C,’s
letter and the Moscow Committee’s resolution: 

The indescribably grave position of the Soviet Republic in the early
years of its existence, extreme devastation and grave military danger, made
it necessary to designate “shock” (and therefore virtually privileged)
departments and groups of workers. This was unavoidable, since the ruined
country could not be saved unless resources and energies were concentrated
on such departments and groups of workers, without the strengthening of
which the imperialists of the whole world would have certainly crushed us
and prevented the Soviet Republic from even starting on economic
construction. 

This circumstance, coupled with the heritage of capitalist and
proprietary habits and attitudes, which are so difficult to get rid of,
explain the necessity for directing

    

the Party’s attention again and again to the struggle for

  implementingÉ[6]



Éthe need for practical guarantees that the decisions of the
Party, which is unanimous on the above-mentioned questions of principle,
should not remain on paper. The conference therefore directs the Central
Committee immediately to resolve, carry out and furthermore propose to the
next congress of the Party that it endorse the following: 

(1) the absolute obligatoriness of more frequent and wider meetings of
Party members parallel with other measures for developing activity among
the Party membership; 

(2) literary organs to be set up, capable of carrying out a more
systematic and wider criticism of the Party’s mistakes and generally of
criticism within the Party (discussion leaflets, etc.); 

(3) precise practical rules to be drawn up on measures for eliminating
the existing inequality (in the conditions of life, size of salaries, and
so forth) between specialists and executives, on the one hand, and the rank
and file, on the other-an inequality that violates democracy, is a source
of demoralisation within the Party and lowers the prestige of Communists;


(4) it shall be found necessary to set up a Control Commission
parallel with the Central Committee consisting of the most experienced,
unbiassed comrades having the longest Party training and capable of
carrying out strict Party control. The Control Commission elected by the
congress of the Party should have the right to receive all kinds of
complaints and examine them by arrangement with the Central Committee and
if necessary by holding joint meetings with it or by submitting the
question to the Party congress.

Proposals for the Resolution on the Immediate Tasks of
   Party

 Development[9]
Re the composition of the Control Commission.

 Adopt resolution of the C.C.: 

that we nominate C.C. members to the Control Commission


only at the desire of the Party conferences, considering it
generally incorrect that these C.C. members are not bound


by the decisions of the C.C.  in their work within the Control Commission;


that C.C. members of the Control Commission do not vote in the latter
when the matter specially concerns their


departments or field of work. 

As regards transference, add:


without detriment to those being transferred familiarising themselves
with the matter in hand and without detriment to the work, i.e., only in
such a manner as ensures that the management of affairs remains
always in the hands of fully competent workers who guarantee
success.

The Ninth All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) held in
Moscow from September 22 to 25, 1920, was attended by 241 delegates (116 of
them voting delegates and 125 with a consultative voice) representing
700,000 Party members. There were delegates from the gubernia organisations
of the R. S.  F.S,R. and the Ukraine, from the C.C. of the Communist
Parties of Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Red Army was represented by 34
delegates. The agenda consisted of the following items: 1) Report by the
delegate from the Polish Communists; 2) Political report of the C.C.; 3)
Organisa-tional report of the C.C.; 4) The immediate tasks of Party
develop-ment; 5) Report of the Party History Studies Committee; 6) Report
on the Second Congress of the Communist International. 

Lenin opened the conference with the Central
Committee’s political report (see present edition. Vol. 31, pp.  275-79),
which dealt mainly with two questions-that of concluding peace with Poland
and organising Wrangel’s defeat. 

Lenin’s report was followed by heated debates,
especially on the causes of the Soviet troops’ setback near Warsaw.
Wind-ing up the debate, Lenin pointed out that the speeches of the
delegates provided rich material for drawing necessary lessons and
deductions. The conference unanimously passed a resolution on the terms of
peace with Poland, and approved the statement by the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee concerning the specific peace.. terms drawn up under
Lenin’s direction and edited by him (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI,
P. 123-26). 

A highlight of the Ninth Conference was the discussion
of the question of the immediate tasks of Party development. The anti-Party
group of "Democratic Centralism" put forward T. V. Sapronov as co-reporter
to air their views on this question. They came out against Party discipline
and the Party’s guiding role in the Soviets and the trade unions. The
conference, like the Ninth Congress of the B.C.P. (B.), strongly rebuffed
the "Democrat-ic Centralism" group. 

The conference adopted a re.solution on “The Immediate
Tasks of Party Development” drafted and moved by Lenin (see pp. 212-13 of
this volume), who also wrote the "Proposals for the Resolution on the
Immediate Tasks of Party Development (see p. 214 of this volunie). The
conference called attention to the need for drawing the rank-and-file
Communists intowider active participation in the work of gubernia
conferences and Guhernia Party Committee pie-nums. Measures were outlined
for eliminating red tape in the work of Government and economic bodies. To
combat various abuses and examine complaints received from Communists, the
conference deemed it necessary to set up a Control Commission, and under
the gubernia committees-special Party commissions. 

On the C.C.’s organisational report the conference
adopted a resolution to step up the work of the C.C.’s Secretariat with a
view to achieving greater familiarity with local activities and a pooling
of experience, and to pay more attention to the work of the Agitation and
Propaganda Department; it also urged the necessity of improving the C.C.’s
direct guidance of the organi- sational work of the Red Army and Navy Party
organisations and not allowing the work of these organisations to become
detached from public life. 



[8]
Lenin is referring to the demagogic statement by A. M. Koliontai
alleging persecution for criticism. She said that criticisers were
sometimes offered to go “to nice torrid climes to eat peaches”. 



[9]
Lenin’s proposals concerning the composition of the Control Commission
were, with certain amendments, incorporated in the resolut,.od of the Ninth
All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) “On the Immediate Tasks of Party
Development” (see KPSS v resolyutsiyalch I resheniyakh syezdov,
kon/erentsii I plenumov Ts.K. [The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and
Decisions of Its Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings. of the
Central Committee, Part 1, 1854, pp. 506-12). 

The last paragraph from the words “As regards
transference” was crossed out by Lenin and omitted from the
resolution.

There is no need to speak of our
internal position at this meeting, since all the comrades are sufficiently
informed about this from our press and from work in the local areas. Food
collections are much bigger than they were last year, so are fuel
collections, and these are the foundations of our work. We are worse off as
regards supply, though. Some

    

of the big factories can now be started, and the temper of the workers in
them cannot be as hopeless as it was when the factories were at a
standstill. Considering our economic situation, we can expect a change of
heart. 

I find it necessary to dwell on our external position, on the news of
foreign policy. Poland is in the grip of a tremendous crisis:
economically, Poland has suffered worse destruction than we have;
politically, things have reached a point when even an opportunist party
like the

P.P.S.,[1] which has always conducted a vicious smear campaign against
the Bolsheviks, protests against the brutal manner in which the government
deals with the workers. In the territory which we are ceding to them under
the peace treaty Poland will be able to rule only by violence. Among the
worker and peasant masses of Poland there is a tremendous desire for
peace. In offering Poland peace and making tremendous concessions we shall
make the political parties realise that we were right, make them realise
that we did not want war with Poland. By taking indemnities from us, Poland
gains nothing. She will not receive the money-France will take it. Up till
now this fact has been concealed in Poland, but the position is gradually
being brought home to the workers, and we must see to it that it is brought
home to them still more clearly. Therefore it is necessary that we now
conclude peace. Besides, we shall win time and use it to strengthen our
army. 

On the Wrangel front the odds are in our favour, but at one time there
was a grave danger to the Donets coal-field. Wrangel is frustrating our
plan of a general offensive by dealing separate blows in various
directions. 

An, at first glance insignificant, incident is characteristic
politically. Germany has allowed entry to Comrades Zinoviev and Bukharin to
attend the forthcoming congress of the Independent Party in Germany. Maybe
this is sheer provocation, but, on the other hand, there is no doubt that
Zinoviev’s arrival will speed up and deepen the split that had already
started among the “Independents”. Part of the breakaway “Independents”
and up to a million members of the Communist Party of Germany will
constitute an imposing revolutionary force. What is more, it will serve as
immense propaganda material for all Europe. 
 

The crux of the matter is that the imperialist policy of France now
stands, revealed-of France, who has always upset our peace talks and is now
putting spokes in our wheel again. We must make use of every hour of the
armistice to strengthen ourselves. We must step up our supply activities,
achieve quick successes on the Wrangel front, and then we can hope to tear
the web of diplomatic intrigues against us. 

The situation in the Far East is such that Japan is bound to withdraw,
since she cannot possibly face a winter campaign. This strengthens us. At
the present time there is an American multi-millionaire in Moscow, who is
negotiating a concession on Kamchatka. By granting this concession we shall
aggravate relations between Japan and America. 

In Turkestan and the Caucasus the situation is more
complicated. Recently the Turks have started to move on Armenia with the
aim of seizing Batum, and afterwards, perhaps, Baku. Obviously we must show
the greatest caution in this matter. So far we have no information about
military complications. 

However great the disagreements between France and Britain,, we-cannot
work on them now so long as we are having defeat instead of
victory. Apparently, disagreements do exist. Britain wants to trade with us
and we are trying to achieve this. 

As to how our army is equipped with weapons I cannot say in any
detail. There was a shortage of cartridges until recently, but the
difficulties now have lessened. The work is on a strong foundation, it only
has to be intensified still more. The Party organisations must help in this
by working in the Party cells and through the trade unions. 

As to what the chances are for victory, I cannot say just now, as the
general feeling is hard to define at the moment. The disappointment is too
great; six weeks have already passed since we started to retreat and we are
still retreating. The thing is we are late with winter supplies; this has
coincided with the defeat. Without doubt, we must make use of every moment
of the armistice to strengthen ourselves. 

We cannot set the tone for agitation until we know something
definite. This meeting is already setting the tone. 
 

According to Comrade Trotsky the question of Makhno has been very
seriously discussed in military circles and it has been ascertained that we
can expect nothing but a winning hand here. The reason is that the elements
grouped around Makhno have already had experience of Wrangel’s regime, and
were not satisfied with what he could give them. Our agreement with Makhno
is hedged around with guarantees that he will not go against us. We have
the same, picture here as with Denikin and Kolchak: as soon as they
infringed upon the interests of the kulaks and the peasantry as a whole,
the latter sided with us. 

Unquestionably, the Poles, too, will use the armistice to strengthen
themselves; maybe they will bring up munitions during that period, but that
does not mean that we should not do the same. 

So long as there is war, secret diplomacy must exist as a means of
warfare. We cannot renounce it. An assessment of this diplomacy depends on
a general assessment of the war. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
P.P.S.—Polska Partia Socjalistyczna (The Polish Socialist
Party)—a reformist and nationalist party founded in 1892. Throughout the
party’s history Left-wing groups kept springing up within it as a result of
pressure from the rank-and-file workers. Some of these groups eventually
joined the revolutionary wing of the Polish working-class movement. 

In 1906 the party split up into the P.P.S. Left wing
and the Right, chauvinist wing (the so-called "revolutionary
faction"). Under the influence of the Bolshevik Party and the
Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, the Left wing gradually
adopted a consistent revolutionary stand.  

During the First World War a large part of the
P.P.S. Left wing adopted an internationalist stand. In December 1918 it
united with the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania to form the
Communist Workers’ Party of Poland (as the Communist Party of Poland was
known up to 1925).  

During the First World War the P.P.S. Right wing
continued the policy of national chauvinism, organising Polish legions on
the territory of Galicia to fight on the side of Austro-German
imperialism. With the formation of the Polish bourgeois state the Right
P.P.S. in 1919 united with the P.P.S. organisations on Polish territories
formerly seized by Germany and Austria, and resumed the name of the
P.P.S. On becoming the ruling party, it helped transfer power to the
Polish bourgeoisie, systematically carried on anti-communist propaganda,
and supported a policy of aggression against the Soviet Union, a policy of
conquest and oppression against Western Ukraine and Western
Byelorussia. Various groups in the P.P.S. who disagreed with this policy
joined the Communist Party of Poland.  

After Pilsudski’s coup (May 1926) the P.P.S. was
nominally a parliamentary opposition, but actually it carried on no active
fight against the regime, and continued its anticommunist and anti-Soviet
propaganda. During that period the Left-wing elements of the
P.P.S. collaborated with the Polish Communists and supported united front
tactics in a number of campaigns.  

During the Second World War the P.P.S. again split
up. A reactionary and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name

Wolno&whatthe&whatthe, R&whatthewno&whatthe&whatthe,
Niepodleg&whattheo&whatthe&whatthe (Liberty, Equality, Independence),
joined the reactionary Polish émigré "government" in
London. The Left faction, which called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish
Socialists, under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party, which was
founded in 1942, joined the popular front against the Nazi invaders, fought
for Poland’s liberation, and pursued a policy of friendly relations with
the U.S.S.R.  

In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern
territories by the Russia’s Red Army and the formation of a Polish
Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists
resumed the name of P.P.S.  and together with the P.W.P. participated in
the building up of a post-war Poland. In December 1948 the P.W.P.  and the
P.P.S. amalgamated and formed the Polish United Workers’ Party.

1. Not special ideas, but Marxism. 



2. Not the invention of a new proletarian culture,
but the development of the best models, traditions and results of
the existing culture, from the point of view of the
Marxist world outlook and the conditions of life and struggle of the
proletariat in the period of its dictatorship. 

3. Not apart from the People’s Commissariat for Education,
but as part of it, since the R.C.P. + Commissariat for Education
= σ Proletcult. 

4. Proletcult’s close link with and subordination
to the Commissariat for Education.

[2]
Lenin wrote this at a meeting of the Politbureau on October 9, 1920,
when the question of drafting a resolution for the Proletcult congress was
discussed. Lenin’s rough draft contains the main theses of his Draft Resolution on Proletarian Culture written on the
eve, October 8. 

Proletcult (Proletarian Culture)—a cultural
 and educational organisation which arose in September 1917 as an
 independent workers’ organisation. Proletcult continued to uphold its
 "independence" after the October Revolution, thus setting itself in
 opposition to the proletarian state. It shunned the leadership of the
 Communist Party and insisted on keeping its bodies independent from the
 Soviet authorities, notably the People’s Commissariat for Education, lead
 by A. Lunacharsky. Its members virtually denied the cultural legacy of the
 past, shirked the tasks of cultural and, educational work among the
 masses, and, by isolating themselves from life, aimed at creating a
 special “proletarian culture” by “laboratory methods”. Bogdanov,
 Proletcult’s c.hief ideologist, paid lip-service to Marxism, but actually
 expounded subjective idealism, Machism. Proletcult had a mixed
 membership. In addition to bourgeois intellectuals, who held leading
 positions in many of its organisations, the membership included young
 workers who sincerely wished to promote cultural progress in the Soviet
 state. See Leon Trotsky’s 1923 essay on the concept of “proletarian
 culture” in his What
 Is Proletarian Culture, and Is It Possible? 

The Communist Party came out strongly against the
separatist tendencies of Proletcult. In October 1920 Lenin raised the
question of Proletcult before the Politbureau of the Central
Committee. Following the latter’s decision based on Lenin’s draft, the
Chief Committee for Political Education drafted instructions governing the
relations between Proletcult and the Commissariat for Education. These
instructions were endorsed by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee
on November 10, 1920.  

In 1932 Proletcult ceased to exist

[was suppressed by the Stalinist regime—MIA Ed.].

Having discussed the reports and communications made at a
meeting of the Politbureau of the Central Committee with 27 delegates from
the Baku Congress of the Peoples of the

East,[2] on 13.X.1920, the Politbureau of the C.C. has decided: 

1. To extend the work of the Council of Nationalities under
the People’s Commissariat for Nationalities; a report on this work to be
made at the next meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars. 

2. To institute the strictest investigations into abuses
and acts of violence committed by the local Russian population towards the
Eastern peoples (especially the Kalmyks, Buryat-Mongols and so on) and to
punish the offenders. 

3. To issue in the name of the supreme Soviet authority a
manifesto confirming the principles of the T.S.F.S.R.’s national policy and
establishing more effective control over its lull application. 

4. To consider it necessary to carry out autonomy, in forms
appropriate to the concrete conditions, for those Eastern nationalities
which do not yet possess autonomous institutions, first and foremost for the
Kalmyks and Buryat-Mongols. The Commissariat for Nationalities to be
charged with this task. 

5. On the agrarian question, to consider it necessary to
restore to the mountaineers of the Northern Caucasus the lands they were
deprived of by the Great Russians, at the expense of the kulak elements of
the Cossack population, and to direct the C.P.C. immediately to prepare
appropriate decrees. 

6. To draw up instructions for all agents of the C.C. and
the central Soviet authorities sent from Moscow to regions inhabited by
Eastern peoples. The weight of emphasis

    

in these instructions to be made on clarifying the duty of the agents to
act only through the local bodies consisting of representatives of the
local working population, and to consider their chief task to be to fight
against the bourgeois and pseudo-communist groups among the local
population while at the same time giving support to the really communist
groups and elements. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s draft, with amendments, was adopted by the Politbureau at its
meeting on October 14, 1920. 



[2]
The Baku Congress of the Peoples of the East (the First
Congress of the Peoples of the East) was held in Baku between September 1
and 7, 1920. It was attended by 1,891 delegates representing 37
nationalities (of the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, China, Egypt,
India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Syria, Turkey and other countries). Two-thirds
of the delegates (1,273) were Communists. 

The congress discussed the following questions: 1) The
international situation and the tasks of the working peoples of the East;
2) the national and colonial question; 3) the agrarian question; 4) the
Soviets in the East; 5) the organisational question and others. Four
sections were formed to prepare the material for the congress: the
agrarian, the national and colonial, the Soviet activities, and the
organisational sections.  

The congress supported the decisions of the Second
Congress of the Communist International and drew up a number of resolutions
based on these decisions. To implement these decisions the congress
organised a Council of Propaganda and Action of the Peoples of the East as
a permanent body under the Executive Committee of the Comintern.  Speaking
of the Second Congress of the Communist International and the First
Congress of the Peoples of the East, Lenin pointed out: “These were
international congresses which united the Communists and showed that in all
civilised countries and in all the backward countries of the East, the
banner of Bolshevism, the programme of Bolshevism, the line of Bolshevik
action are an emblem of salvation, an emblem of struggle to the workers of
all civilised countries and the peasants o all the backward colonial
countries. They showed that, during the past three years, Soviet Russia not
only beat off those who fell upon her in order to throttle her, but won the
sympathy of the working people of the whole world ...” (see present
edition, Vol. 31, pp. 329-30),

cure, towards representatives of the so-called opposition who have suffered
a psychological crisis due to failures in their administrative or Party

of their report as far as the general economic plan of the R.S.F.S.R. is
concerned (if possible, written theses of the report to be given). 

Written November 1, 1920


 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This document is part of a decision of the C.P.C. adopted on October
26, 1920, following a discussion of the question of establishing contacts
between the economic commissariats. 

This question was raised in April 1920 at the Ninth
Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), whose corresponding resolution read: “The
Congress directs the C.C. to devise in the immediate future a system of
organisational connections between the Supreme Economic Council and other
commissariats directly engaged in economic affairs (the commissariats for
food, railways, and agriculture) in their everyday work with the aim of
securing complete unity in the fulfilment of the economic plan approved by
the Congress of the Party” (The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and
Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the
Central Committee, Part 1, 1954, p. 490). In pursuance of the congress
decision, Lenin, at the meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on
October 26, 1920, made a report “On Unifying the Work of the Economic
Commissariats in Framing an Integrated Economic Plan” and tabled his draft
resolution. 



[2]
This trio was appointed by the Council of People’s Commissars on
October 26, 1920, to collect information regarding the interdepartmental
commissions.

The exact wording of the resolution of the Central
Executive Committee speaks of “unification of all work of political
education in the

R.S.F.S.R.[2] 

While definitely recognising the need for such unification, the
Politbureau of the C.C.,R.C.P.(B.) establishes, first of all, that this
unification can only be understood in the sense of preserving,
strengthening and extending not only the independence of the Party
organisation but its leading, guiding and preponderant position in regard
to all fields of work without exception under the auspices of the People’s
Commissariat for Education. 

The implementation of the C.E.C.’s resolution should he divided into
two parts: a motion should be tabled immediately in the Council of People’s
Commissars for the unification of the institutions exactly enumerated in
the resolution of the C.E.C. 

This motion to be drafted not later than tomorrow, 29,X., by two
members of the C.C.—Bukharin and Preobrazhensky. 
 

The latter part of the task will cover: further unification of all
parallel bodies of an educational nature in all the people’s commissariats
and elaboration of the organisational relations between the agitation and
propaganda bodies of the R.C.P. and the educational bodies of the
Commissariat for Education which are subordinate to them. 

A report on this latter part, giving an accurate list of all parallel
bodies in all the commissariats, is to be submitted to the Politbureau by
Comrades Preobrazhensky and Bukharin. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s draft was incorporated in toto in the decision on the
Chief Committee for Political Education which was adopted at the meeting of
the Politbureau on October 28, 1920. 

The Chief Committee for Political Education
was established under the People’s Commissariat for Education by a decree
of the Council of People’s Commissars signed by Lenin on November 12,
1920. Administratively and organisationally part of the Commissariat for
Education, it was subordinated directly to the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B,.) on
matters dealing with the ideological content of its work. The C.C.P.E. was
in charge of all activities in the teld of political education, agitation
and propaganda, directed the mass communist education of adults (the anti-
illiteracy movement, schools, clubs, libraries and village reading-rooms)
and also Party education (the communist universities and Party
schools). Until reorganised (in June 1930) into the Mass Work Sector of the
People’s Commissariat for Education, the C.C.P.E. was headed by
N. K. Krupskaya. 



[2]
This refers to the resolution of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee “On Measures for Stepping Up the Activities of the People’s
Commissariat for Education”. It was published in Izvestia No. 226
for October 10, 1920.

6/XI.1920
 To Members of the C.C., R.C.P. 

Please consider and carry through at the plenum on 8.XI. a resolution
that the report at the Congress of Soviets on 20/XII.2O on the second item
of the agenda, namely, "The Basic Tasks of Economic Rehabilitation” be
made by the Chairman of GOELRO (the State Commission for the
Electrification of Russia), G. M.

Krzhizhanovsky.[1] 

We shall achieve effective implementation of the general plan of
economic rehabilitation, which plan, without electrification, is nothing,
and talk about “basic tasks” unrelated to this plan would not be serious.

 For your preliminary information I enclose:


1) A copy of Krzhizhanovsky’s memorandum “Results of the Work of
the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia”. 

2) The booklet Basis of Northern Region Electrification
Project, of which 3 copies for Trotsky, Rykov and Bukharin I can obtain
tomorrow; the rest of the C.C. members should call up the switchboard, 2nd
floor, if they wish to have copies.  
 

3) Some electrification maps.  

4) Proofs of the article: “Volga Area Electrification Plan” 


1 copy to Comrade Trotsky to be handed to Comrade Rykov and then to the
remaining C.C. members 

5) Stunkel’s theses.  

6) Krug’s theses.  

7) List of GOELRO material (over 200 works).  

The sum of these documents shows clearly that we are fully able (by
timely correction of the theses and plan of Krzhizhanovsky’s report
submitted on behalf of the C.C.) to get at the Congress of Soviets exactly
what the Party and the country need, namely, a report on the “Basic Tasks
of Economic Rehabilitation", which is both business-like and which sets
forth the plan of work in a broad and attractive manner.  

V. Lenin 

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At the plenary meeting of the C.C. on November 9, 1920,
G. M. Krzhizhanovsky was instructed to prepare for the Eighth All-Russia
Congress of Soviets a report, “On the Electrification of Russia”. At the
Congress of Soviets hold in Moscow from December 22 to 29, 1920, this
report, on the proposal of the presiding committee, was included in the
agenda of the congress.

Comrade Lenin said in his speech that the victory we had
won was the most important of all. The international bourgeoisie had
prevented us from engaging. in productive labour, and all our energies in
the course of three years had been engaged in war with them. Now we must
win a victory on the home front. The bourgeoisie had diverted us from this
work. Comrade Lenin spoke about the questions to be dealt with at the
coming congress of Soviets—the

    

questions of transport, agriculture, and so on. He said that all enthusiasm
and discipline were to be switched over to the work of peaceful
construction and the participation of the rank and file in this job was to
be secured. 

In addition, red tape and officialism had to be combated. Here, too, we
had to win a victory, and there was only one way of doing that-by
developing the consciousness and activity of the working masses
themselves. In conclusion Comrade Lenin expressed the conviction that we
would win a victory over cold and hunger.

Confirming the resolution of the Politbureau, the C.C.
approves in the main of the draft instructions drawn up in pursuance
thereof by the Chief Committee for Political

Education[2] and directs the Politbureau to edit it for a more exact
expression of the main idea that the work of Proletcult in the field of
scientific and political education merges with that of the People’s
Commissariat for Education and the Gubernia Education Departments, while in
the artistic field (music, the theatre, fine arts and literature) it
remains autonomous, and the leading role of the commissariat’s organs,
carefully screened by the R.C.P., is to be retained only for combating
patently bourgeois deviations.

Zinoviev to be instructed to draw up detailed directives to
Kopp and other comrades from the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade
and to the comrades working in Germany. 

Mention to be made that we accept and highly appreciate the assistance
of the rank-and-file workers in the execution of orders for Russia,
including those workers who belong to the most reactionary of the trade
unions. 

At the same time we should expose the Legiens & Co., who want to make
money out of this for themselves or their party, and give no money. 

The text to be submitted to the Politbureau.

A commission composed of Comrades Lenin, Milyutin, Kursky,
Lezhava and Sereda to be directed within a

 week[1]

to revise and edit that part of the draft on concessions which is suitable
for publication abroad, namely, first, the general decision, as a matter of
principle, to grant concessions; second, a brief outline of the general
economic and legal conditions for concessions; third, a list of, concession
objects with a sufficiently clear description of the economic significance
of each

object.[3]

[2]
In the interests of the country’s speedy economic rehabilitation and in
order to establish peaceful business relations with the capitalist
countries the Soviet Government considered it possible to grant concessions
to foreign companies. On October 30, 1920, Speaking of the Second Congress
of the Communist International and the First Congress of the Peoples of the
East, Lenin pointed out: “These were international congresses which united
the Communists and showed that in all civilised countries and in all the
backward countries of the East, the banner of Bolshe- vism, the programme
of Bolshevism, the line of Bolshevik action are an emblem of salvation, an
emblem of struggle to the workers of all civilised countries and the
peasants of all the backward colonial countries. They showed that, during
thc-. past three years, Soviet Russia not only beat off those who fell upon
her in order to throttle her, but won the sympathy of the working people of
the whole world ...” (see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 329-30), p. 218

The Commissariat for Food to be directed, as a most
important political and economic task, to regularly supply Baku with food
to the extent of one hundred per cent of its requirements. 

The food policy in Azerbaijan to be relaxed, namely, no grain at all to
be taken from the peasants of Azerbaijan outside Mugan, and in Mugan itself
with great care. 

Frumkin to be directed immediately to report strict and punctilious
execution of these directives twice a month to the Central Committee and
the Council of

Defence.[2] 

A policy of utmost conciliation to be adopted towards Georgia, Armenia,
Turkey and Persia, i.e., one directed most of all towards avoiding
war. 

We must not set ourselves the task of conducting any campaign against
Georgia, or Armenia, or Persia. 

The main task is to be that of guarding Azerbaijan and securing
possession of the whole Caspian. 

For this purpose the transference to Azerbaijan of no less than 7
divisions is to be speeded up in every possible way. 

Propaganda, agitation, the development of the Committees of Poor

Peasants,[3] and general Soviet activities in Azerbaijan to be stepped
up in every way; for this purpose Comrade Stalin to be directed through the
Orgbureau to dig up from everywhere he can the greatest possible number of
Moslem Communists for work in Azerbaijan. 

The Commissariat for Railways and the

S.C.T.[4] to be directed to find means of transporting no less than 8
troop trains daily to Baku without affecting the supply of food to Russia,

This draft, with slight amendments, was adopted at the meeting of the

This refers to the Council of Labour and Defence. The Council of
Workers’ and Peasants’ Defence was reorganised at the beginning of April
1920 and renamed the Council of Labour and Defence. Under a decision of the
Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December 1920 the Council began to
operate as a C.P.C. commission responsible for co-ordinating the work of
all economic departments. It was abolished in. 1937. 



[3]
The Committees of Poor Peasants  came into being in the
Azerbaijan countryside after the proclamation of the Azerbaijan Soviet
Socialist Republic. The decision calling for their organisation was adopted
by the Politbureau of the CC. of the Azerbaijan Communist Party
(Bolsheviks) in August 1920.

Theses to be revised rather radically, on all points, in
the direction of a very big reduction in the pledges, which are extremely
vague, obscure and excessive and the weight of emphasis to be placed on
concrete, practical proposals realisable in a short time. 

Supplementary to the theses, a draft resolution for the Eighth Congress
of Soviets to be drawn up within a week. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On November 27, 1920, the Politbureau examined Zinoviev’s theses of a
report, “On Improving the Activities of the Soviet Local and Central
Authorities and on Combating Bureaucratism” for the forthcoming Eighth
All-Russia Congress of Soviets. The Politbureau endorsed Lenin’s draft and
set up a commission which was authorised to revise the theses. These, in
their final wording, were published on December 14, 1920, in Pravda
 and Izvestia.

In regard to the proposal of the People’s Commissar for
Foreign Affairs that Krasin’s Mission be temporarily recalled from

Britain[1] as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the British
Government, the Politbureau makes no immediate decision on this matter arid
invites Krasin to give his opinion urgently. There is no question of a
break with Britain, but merely that of pressure, for it is clear that
Churchill, Curzon & Co. are dragging their feet and deceiving u, therefore,
a temporary departure may prove very useful and intensify agitation by the
Councils of

Action.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
L. B. Krasin headed the Soviet delegation sent to negotiate a trade
agreement with the British Government. 



[2]
Councils of Action  were set up in August 1920 by the British
workers to prevent Britain making war on Soviet Russia. The Communist Party
of Great Britain was largely instrumental in getting these councils
organised. The councils campaigned for Britain’s recognition of Soviet
Russia and the establishment of normal relations between the two countries.
The Politbureau of the CC., R.C.P.(B.) adopted Lenin’s Motion. See also

The Politbureau approves the proposal of Comrade Chicherin
on the question of the trade agreement with Britain and particularly
emphasises: 

that Krasin, without the special and explicit consent of the Central
Committee, should on no account go beyond the text and letter of our Note
of 29.VI on the questions of propaganda and

debts[2]; 

all details to be dealt with at special talks on a peace treaty. 

In motivation, reference to be made to their aid to

Wrangel.[3]

Comrades, so many notes have been sent up that I cannot
possibly answer them all. On the other hand, most of the arguments have
already been refuted in the debate, so

    



I shall first comment on the booklet On

Concessions.[1]
I shall deal with this in greater detail. Comrade Lomov’s
one-and-a-half page preface deals with the subject all too briefly. Then
there is the decree itself of November 23, which sets forth the idea of the
interests of world economy. “The process of restoring the productive
forces of Russia, and at the same time, of world economy as a whole, can be
accelerated many times over by enlisting the co-operation of foreign state
and municipal institutions, private enterprises, joint-stock companies,
co-operative societies and workers’ organisations of other countries in the
extraction and processing of Russia’s natural resources.” Of course, this
is merely of propaganda value, but it is economically indisputable. World
economy has got to be restored. Capitalism acts in such and such a way, and
we have our own proposals, but so far world economy remains
capitalist. 

We wanted to attract foreigners. Therefore the end of the decree lists
these conditions: 

Point One: “The concessionaire is to receive reward in the form of a
share of the produce stipulated in the agreement with the right of
exporting it abroad.” Without this they won’t go. The share is not
specified. There will be a fight over this, we shall bargain and each of us
will try to get the best of it. Comrades here said we shall have to keep
our eyes skinned, and that’s quite right. 

Point Two: “In the event of special technical improvements being
employed on a large scale the concessionaire will be granted trade
priorities (such as the purchase of machinery, special agreements on large
orders, etc.).” What do trade priorities mean? They mean we shall give
this or that firm a priority agreement to the exclusion of another
firm. And if the firm takes concessions, we can buy them out, we may pay
them extra on the price. The main thing is that we shall be given
machines. I think this consideration is clear enough, and here again we
shall maintain elements of propaganda. 

Point Three: “Depending on the nature and conditions of the concession
prolonged concession terms will be granted to ensure full compensation for
the concessionaire’s risk and technical facilities invested in the
concession.”  Here we have the duration of the concessions. It is quite an

    

indefinite period, and we couldn’t give Kamchatka on any other conditions,
and Comrades Fedotov and Skvortsov are right about this being a special
concession, which we are granting for important political reasons. In
granting them under such conditions we are willingly giving away what we do
not need ourselves, and we shall be no worse off for the loss of it neither
economically nor politically. 

Point Four: “The Government of the R.S.F.S.R. guarantees that the
concessionaire’s property invested in the enterprise shall not be subject
to nationalisation, confiscation or requisition.”  Haven’t you forgotten
that we still have the law court? This is a well-considered phrase with
which we were deeply concerned. We wanted to mention it at first, then
thought better of it and decided to say nothing. Speech is silver but
silence is gold. There won’t be confiscation or requisition, but there
remains the law court, and that court is ours, and if I am not mistaken it
is composed of people elected by the Soviets. Personally, I hold anything
but a gloomy view about our court being a poor one. So we shall make use of
it. 

Point Five: “The concessionaire shall have the right to hire workers
and other employees for his enterprises in the R.S.F.S.R. with due
observance of the code of labour laws or a special agreement guaranteeing
workers definite conditions of work that protect their lives and health.”
There is nothing cautious here. If the workers go on strike and that strike
is a reasonable one, we shall then be able secretly to support the
strikers. What threat do the capitalists use? “We’ll throw you out into
the street and you will starve.”  But here they may find themselves
getting a ration from somewhere or other, it all depends on us. We can and
shall give it to them. And if the strike is a silly one, unreasonable,
we’ll have them up on the Soviet carpet and tell them off good and
proper. It speaks here of a special agreement, but it is worded very
carefully. By way of exception, however, it will have to be applied to
Kamchatka, as we are not in a position to set up any Soviet bodies
there. This is where Vanderlip was to demand a special agreement. We
haven’t even started yet to apply our own laws to Kamchatka. 

Point Six: “The Government of the R.S.F.S.R. guarantees the
concessionaire against any unilateral change in the

    

terms of the concession agreement by any order or decree of the
Government.”  We undertake not to change the terms of the agreement
unilaterally, otherwise no one will sign it. This means there must be some
go-betweens. Who? The neutral states are all capitalist states. Workers’
organisations? We may have to invite Menshevik workers’ organisations. In
Western Europe they are in a majority. Maybe the Mensheviks will decide in
turn-even number for the Bolsheviks, odd number for the capitalists. But if
we don’t come to terms, the agreement may be broken. That danger remains,
but if it is a property agreement there is no harm in that. According to
the basic principles of international law this is a private agreement, and
you can break it, paying compensation, of course. If you broke it you’ve
got to pay. There have been cases in the practice of international law when
the ship of another country has been sunk by mistake during the war. It was
taken for an enemy ship, but proved to be a neutral vessel. What is to be
done? Pay up. The same here, as a last resort you buy yourself off. There
still remains withdrawal from the war, though. War, of course, in the final
analysis, is the ultimate argument. Of course, so long as there are
capitalists in the world you must be prepared for war, once you have a
socialist state. Further, we here are worrying now, but no one has taken a
concession yet. When certain comrades say, “Ah well, this is the end,
they’ll all come crowding in now,” I repeat, it’s possible that no one
will care to take it at all. 

Section One: “Timber concessions in Western Siberia.”  The Northern
Sea Passage is open for shipping, but we have no merchant fleet. A comrade
says representatives have arrived, wishing to receive 6000 dessiatines in
checkered order. The northern booklet says that if we take the extra
electric stations of Petrograd we could use them for taking timber out of
the northern districts and develop a production that would give us foreign
currency to the value of five hundred thousand gold rubles a year. And
total electrification, according to the estimate of the State Commission,
will cost over a thousand million. It is a question whether we shall he
able to do it. Concessions, however, will make this task easier. You don’t
go about offering concessions because you find life good, and when that
life is a hungry

    

one, when you have to wangle things so as to give the people a respite, you
have to argue differently. 

Section Three: “Mining concessions in Siberia.”  Siberia is
fabulously rich in copper. Copper has an extremely high value in world
economy and is one of the principal metals used in electrification. We are
offering a concession but do not know who will take it. America or the
Germans. America will think that if she doesn’t take it, Germany will. 

When we carry through electrification we shall be a hundred times
stronger economically. We shall then speak a different language. We shall
speak about redemption. They know that the socialist society is not only
quick at creating a Red Army, but can be quick in other things as
well. 

Further, separate concessions. Three million dessiatines in the
European part of Russia alone. Of these, over 800,000 dessiatines in the
former Don Cossack Region. There are no state farms or livestock. Whole
stanitsas along the river Ural are ruined, splendid virgin lands are lying
idle. Even if we give away three quarters of the wheat crop raised there,
we shall receive one quarter. We must strengthen our transport and we can
stipulate that tractors be delivered cheaper. 

If we cannot put three million dessiatines of magnificent land to the
plough, which will yield us 100 poods of wheat per dessiatine—then what
sort of farming is it? What sort of policy is it? 

The Italians are interested in this, and Italy is on the eve of a
revolution. In Italy the main argument against a revolution is “We won’t
be able to feed ourselves, the capitalist powers won’t give us any
food”. But the socialist power says, “I have three million dessiatines of
land, I have oil and benzine”. You must realise that you can agitate on
various planes about capitalism being a dead thing, and that it must be
strangled. We have seen a good deal. The European is living in the same
conditions as the Russian did when he went towards revolution from the
agonies of war. With them the war is over, they are living by robbing other
peoples. All the more weight does this argument carry. They are unable to
restore their economy, and we offer them to start restoring it now. We have
here combined a political argument and socialist agitation, but

    

in a different form. You must learn to carry on agitation, otherwise your
economic plans will come to nothing. And we are not only agitators, we are
a Socialist Republic standing up to all the capitalist states in the
world. You can’t run your economy, but we can. There is a possibility of
comparison here.

1. The post of Assistant People’s Commissar to be instituted at the
Commissariat for Education with all administrative functions concentrated
in his hands. 

[sic.]

3. General reorganisation of the Commissariat for Education is considered
essential, but it should be more thoroughly prepared, particularly it
should be discussed at a number of meetings in connection with the
Congress of Soviets. Exact distribution of functions between the central
and local bodies of the Commissariat for Education to be discussed and
settled there. 

4. It is considered necessary in principle to merge the secondary
schools (or their higher forms) with technical vocational training under
two indispensable conditions: 1) that general education subjects and
communism in the technical vocational schools be extended; 2) that
practical steps be taken immediately to pass over to polytechnical
education, for which purpose use is to be made of every available electric
station and suitable factory. 

The implementation of this reform is to be deferred pending the general
reorganisation. 

5. Comrade Litkens to be appointed Assistant People’s Commissar and
made to devote no less than half his work

    

hours to the Chief Committee for Political Education until. such time as
this Committee is properly staffed. 

6. The Orgbureau to be directed to speed up the staffing of the Chief
Committee for Political Education and see to it that it is fully provided
for in this

respect.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of reorganising the work of the People’s Commis-sariat for
Education was raised by Lenin in November 1920 (see Collected
Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 42, p. 376). This reorganisation
was necessitated by the fact that the activities and structure of the
Commissariat did not meet the new tasks in the field of public education
arising from the transition to peaceful socialist construction. In his
letter to Lunacharsky dated November 29, 1920, Lenin set forth his
preliminary views on this question (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian]
Edition, page 270 Vol. 52, Document 37). Lenin’s motion calling for the
reorganisation of the Commissariat for Education was adopted by the
C.C. plenum on December 8, 1920, with the addition of Point 2, which reads:
,The work of the People’s Commissariat for Education in the sphere of
organisation and administrative management on a wide national scale as well
as within the apparatus of the Commissariat itself is to be directed by the
People’s Commissar only through his assistant.” 



[2]
On January 26, 1921, the CC. plenum set up a commission headed by Lenin
to work out a scheme for the general reorganisation of the Commissariat for
Education. On January 28, in a letter to the members of the Board of the
Commissariat for Education Lenin asked for urgent information concerning
all types of schools together with the text of existing laws govern- ing
them (see Collected Works,  Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 52,
Document 99). On Lenin’s proposal the Politbureau of the CC.  on February 2
authorised the commission to issue directives to the Board of the
Commissariat for Education in the name of the C.C. of the Party. On
February 5 Pravda  (No. 25) published “Instructions of the
Central Committee to Communists Working in the People’s Commissariat for
Education” signed by Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 120-22,).
On February 11 the Council of People s Commissars endorsed the Regulations
on the People’s Commissariat for Education drawn up by members of the
commission and signed by Lenin.  They were published in Izvestia 
No. 33 for February 15, and in the course of 1921 served as a basis for the
reorganisation of the Commissariat for Education.

Reply To The Debate On The Report

 On Concessions Delivered To The R.C.P.(B.) Group

 At The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 21
Comrades, I have received quite a few notes and shall briefly
answer those to which no replies have yet been given. But first let me read
to you a note of an informative nature, which I think is characteristic: 


At the Arzamas uyezd congress, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a
   non-Party peasant declared the following concerning concessions, which we
   communicate to you as a characteristic sign: “Comrades, we are
   delegating you to the All-Russia Congress and declare that we, peasants,
   are prepared to endure hunger and cold and do our duty for another three
   years but don’t sell Mother-Russia in the form of
   concessions!” 

I think it would be very useful to quote this note in the official report
to the

      Congress,[1]

and it ought to be done because it shows a side of the question which the
capitalists overlook, and in connection with which we have no need whatever
to conceal the fact that there is a danger here, and we have to be on our
guard against it. I have already mentioned that these reminders sharpen the
attention of the workers and peasants. The fact that such reminders are
coming from the midst of the illiterate peasantry is of special importance,
as it stresses a task which is of exceptional

    

importance at the present time-1 mean about your having to examine the
bills tabled in the Council of People’s Commissars for rendering
assistance to peasant farming. We must learn to convince the non-Party
peasants, win them over to our side and make them self-dependent. A note
like this shows that we have every chance of achieving tremendous success
here, and we shall achieve it. 

Here is another note: 


Won’t the capitalist concessionaires set the proletarian masses
   against the Soviet government, seeing that the economic crisis and chaos we
   are living through make it impossible for us to satisfy the needs of the
   workers the way the capitalists can? 


I have said already that in the advanced countries, in most of them,
the workers are better provided for than ours, yet the Russian workers in
all the advanced countries are all eagerness to come to Soviet Russia,
although they are well aware of the hardships the workers have to
bear. 


Won’t the Russian Ryabushinskys and the rest of the
   pack put in an appearance together with the English and American
   capitalists? 


This has a bearing on the note which asks whether the concessionaires
will be exterritorial. Of course not, we shall never grant them
exterritoriality. This is granted only to ambassadors, and even then on
definite conditions. If Ryabushinsky banks on hiding himself from the
proper authorities, I think he is mistaken. 

Next, comrades, I want to tell you that Comrade Lezhava reports:
“Vanderlip has presented a mandate from about a dozen big
syndicates. This has been verified by our special authorities here. It has
already been corroborated by Krasin in London, who has checked up on the
seriousness of the groups for whom Vanderlip is acting.” 

For the benefit of those comrades who ask why the agreement has not
been published, I repeat that its publication is not to our advantage,
because the capitalists, who are fighting among themselves, think there are
far worse things in that agreement. The hullabaloo about it in the press
bears this out. Let them go on believing it, we have no intention whatever
of disillusioning them. Those who wish to familiarise themselves with this
agreement have every possibility of doing so. Besides, 1 mentioned that
the agreement

    

will come into force after the new president of the United States
of America has been sworn in. Our Party congress will be held in

February.[3] Consequently, the Party will have every opportunity of
controlling and deciding things. 


Please explain, if you can, for how long Kamchatka has
   been let (or is proposed to be let) and is there an economic, apart from a
   political, advantage in this for the R.S.F.S.R. and in what form? 


Kamchatka has not been let and cannot be let until March. The economic
gain is that according to the draft agreement they are obliged to give us a
share of the mineral wealth which they will extract. 


In granting concessions do we not thereby admit the durability of the
   capitalist states and do we not consider our thesis concerning the
   earliness of .a world revolution to be incorrect? 


Bukharin has replied to this. It is not a question of our admitting
their durability; the point is that gigantic forces are driving them to the
brink. Our existence and speedy release from the critical situation and
famine are a gigantic force and a factor of revolution more powerful than
those farthings—a mere crumb from the point f view of world economy-which
they will get from us. An extra hundred or thousand machines and
locomotives are of tremendous importance to us, for it will mean that
transport repairs, which Trotsky planned over a period of four and a half
years and reduced to three and a half, will be reduced by another
year. Reducing the economic chaos and famine by a year is of colossal
importance to us. 


What if Japan, to prevent us letting Kamchatka to
   America, goes and occupies it with her troops and declares it her own? 


As a matter of fact she is in possession of Kamchatka right now, and if
she could she would do it, but she can’t because she is afraid of
America. 


Where will the capitalist get his labour force? Will he
   bring it with him? Hardly. If he is going to employ Russian workers, not
   only will these be under the thumb of the capitalist, but it will upset our
   labour market, and this, in turn, will upset our integrated economic
   plan. 

I can’t see how our economic plan will be upset by our workers
going there to work. They won’t be able to go there

    

apart from the trade unions, apart from our economic organisations and our
Party. The workers at the advanced capitalist enterprises will train our
workers in the best methods of production. In submitting to capitalist
conditions of work, our workers will subordinate them to our code of labour
laws or to special restrictive agreements, and will not hesitate to quit if
the conditions are bad. If the conditions are unfavourable, the workers
will quit. Some comrades are afraid that the conditions will be good,
others, that they will be bad. We shall look out, just like our workers and
peasants, and take proper measures. 


In granting concessions, when the concessionaires start
   working, will the activities of the R.C.P. in organising communist cells
   among those employed on the concession territory be open or only illegal?
   


Here is a wrong idea of concessions and concessionaires. The,
concessionaire is not an authority. He does not get any territory other
than that to be used for economic exploitation. All government bodies and
all courts of law remain only in the hands of the R.S.F.S.R. 


Should unemployment in America force a revolution,
   won’t our concessions be helping America to cope with this crisis,
   that is, hold up the revolution. 


That argument has been disproved by Comrade Bukharin. 


If the international bourgeoisie gets to know of the
   Soviet government’s tactics in concessions, what will the position
   of the Soviet government be? Won’t this be bad for us? 


On the contrary, everyone in Europe has heard about the concessions,
and the hullabaloo about it there only goes to show that the bourgeoisie is
worried. They are anxious not to be late. All those capitalists who do not
want to risk having dealings with Russia are now beginning to realise that
they are lagging behind while the more enterprising people are getting
in. And we are taking advantage of the contradictions among the
capitalists. 


Are there any plans or projects for concessions on large
   industrial enterprises in Moscow and in the centre generally? There is talk
   about three such concessions in Moscow, Yaroslavl and Lubertsi. 

I know nothing about such concessions. There is an American factory in
Lubertsi which has not been nationalised

    

and never was, but there is no concession there. The only concession in the
centre, which the S.E.C. comrades have spoken of as being possible, is a
concession to the German chemists for developing dye works and letting one
factory to them. In the Council of People’s Commissars all were
agreed it was possible, but this talk has had no practical
consequences. 

Germany is so far ahead of our country that during the imperialist war
even the advanced countries found them-selves in difficulties when the
German chemical industry stopped supplying them. To get our chemical
industry going we must be prepared to pay the German chemists well. The
best way to learn is to grant the Germans a con-cession on one of our
factories. No schools or lectures will help as much as practical work at a
factory, where the workers can be trained in six months and then made to
build another factory like it next door. To fear that the Germans of a
single factory will do something to us, considering their international
situation, is ridiculous. There were no differences of opinion in the
C.P.C. In point of principle it is acceptable. Unfortunately, this question
has not had practical results. I must stress the fact that we talk a great
deal about concessions, but so far we have not succeeded in granting a
single one. We shall consider it a great success if we manage to grant at
least one, and you will see the concrete conditions of the concession. 

Further. 


What countries can be granted concessions? Can we give a
   concession to Poland? 


We believe they can be granted to all countries, Poland included. 


Couldn’t the capitalists use the concessions to
   avert
   crises at home and thus stave off a social revolution? 


If the capitalists could avert crises at home, then capitalism would
he everlasting. They are decidedly blind pawns in the general mechanism-the
imperialist war has shown that. Every month proves that the crisis of
capitalism is deepening, disintegration throughout the world is spreading
farther and farther, and Russia is the only country where

    

an upswing towards a durable and serious improvement has started. 


To sow dissension among the workers the concessionaires
   may place their workers in better conditions. 


This won’t increase dissension among our people, we have grown
  ;much
stronger. 


Will trade union groups be organised on the
   concessionaire’s territory? 


The concessionaires get economic exploitation, the authorities and laws
remain Soviet ones. 


Can you outline the conditions guaranteeing us against
   the danger of the Soviet state system being distorted and a capitalist
   set-up being introduced? 


These conditions are the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. If a contracting party
breaks them we have the right to cancel the agreement. 


What is the gist of the tentative draft agreement with
   the American imperialists covering a concession on Kamchatka? 


I said that the term of the concession is 50-60 years. We get a share
of the produce, they the right to set up a military and naval base at the
inlet near which there is an oil deposit. 


You say that granting concessions to the capitalists of
   oppressed countries like Germany is more important than for other
   countries. But if the capitalists of oppressed countries use the
   concessions to improve their country’s economic position, don’t you think
   this will stave off the revolution in that country? 


The international situation as regards revolution revolves around
Soviet Russia’s struggle against the rest of the world, the capitalist
countries. To strengthen Soviet Russia and make her invincible-that is what
matters most as far as the struggle of the oppressed and colonial countries
is concerned. 


What role in concessions does Turkestan cotton play? 


So far there is no question of granting a concession on Turkestan
cotton. This question was not discussed. 


Will concessions be granted for the rehabilitation of industrial
   enterprises and for taking over railways? 

 

Such exigencies are ruled out. The railways are a single integrated
enterprise. 


Has there been any question of concessions on slaughter-houses? 


Not that I have heard of. 


The protests against concessions in the local areas stand
   clearly revealed, not as healthy sentiments at all, but as patriotic
   feeling among a strong petty-bourgeois section of the countryside and among
   the urban middle classes. 


The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years
rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without
which we could not hold out for three years. Without this patriotism we
would not have succeeded in defending the Soviet Republic, in doing away
with private property and now getting as much as 300 million poods by means
of the food surplus-appropriation system. This is the finest revolutionary
patriotism. As for the kulaks being prepared to go hungry for three years
to keep out the foreign capitalists, from whom they have something to
gain-that is untrue. It is not the kulaks who are concerned, it is the
non-Party middle peasant. 


Isn’t there a risk that in view of a possible war between
   America and Japan there is a likelihood of a serious attack on Soviet
   Russia by Japan? What shall we do then? Shall we fight off Japan in
   alliance with imperialist America, using her assistance as a real force?
   


Of course we shall-we have often said that an alliance with one
imperialist state against another to consolidate the socialist republic is
not objectionable in point of principle. An attack by Japan on Soviet
Russia is much more difficult now than it was a year ago. 


Please explain the Allies’ policy towards Turkey and our
   relation-ships. 


It is rather awkward, of course, to deal openly with this question in
an official speech, as relations here are extremely confused. Everything
here depends on the intricate play of relations in bourgeois Georgia,
which is on the verge of catastrophe. The comrades who are interested in
this will, I am sure, derive great benefit from the report by Comrade
Meshcheryakov, Editor of Pravda, who has returned from Georgia, where he
spent several weeks, if not

    

months, and has collected highly interesting material on this Menshevik
realm. Georgia is on the verge of disaster. The Turkish attack was planned
against us. The Allies were making a pitfall for us, but fell into it
themselves, because we have received Soviet Armenia. 

The men at the top in Turkey are Cadets, Octobrists, Nationalists, who
are prepared to sell us to the Allies. But that is an extremely difficult
thing to do, because feeling among the Turkish people against the savage
oppression by the Allies is running very high, and sympathy towards Soviet
Russia is growing in proportion as we help the independent Azerbaijan
Republic to carry out proper liberation of the Moslem peasants, who have
driven out the landowners, but are afraid to take the land, and will
shortly stop being afraid; when they do take the land the Turkish landowner
won’t last long. 

We personally have been and will be peaceful in the extreme in the
Caucasus, and for the information of our Caucasian comrades, we shall be
very careful to avoid anything that may involve us in war. Our peaceful
policy so far has been so felicitous, that the Allies are getting nervous,
have started taking decisive steps against us, but are only getting them
against themselves. 


What is going to happen next to Georgia? 


Even the Mohammedan Allah doesn’t know that, but if we show
self-restraint we have something to gain without running any risk. 

We are asked whether there were any other concession objects besides
Kamchatka. There have been no other concessions with Vanderlip. 

Regarding press hand-outs. We can’t do that, first because the
printing-works are busy, and secondly so as not to make this material
available to people abroad, where there is a desire to torpedo this
undertaking of ours. So far we haven’t got a single concession, a single
agreement, and we must first get an agreement before speaking about
dangers. We have nothing so far and are acting semi-legally. 


How will things stand with concessions and with works and
   buildings erected by concessionaires in the event of a) their violating
   the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. b) war breaking out with a country of which the
   concessionaire is a subject, and c) with others? 

 

In the event of an agreement being violated the concessionaire will be
prosecuted under the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. In the event of war the
concession agreement is broken and the property passes into the possession
of the R.SF.S.R. in accordance with military procedure. 


The Russian bourgeoisie, who have escaped abroad, will be
   able to take part in the exploitation of concessions with their
   capital. Won’t this lead to the old bosses coming back under the guise of
   foreign capital? 


If an old boss takes a ride through the northern forests of European
Russia under the guise of foreign capital we have nothing to fear. You will
find many an old boss in the centre of Moscow. We have a thousand times
less reason to fear a situation in which we shall have a list of all
visiting foreigners, than those bosses who are operating at our
enterprises and who, unfortunately, have not been registered yet. 


You have pointed out and underlined the political
   significance of concessions. That is understandable. But what the provinces
   are most worried about is this: with concessions there will be trade
   relations. What threats and dangers to the Republic does this imply in the
   sense of disintegration and the blowing up of the Soviet system from within
   (perhaps increased profiteering, etc.) and what precautions can we take
   against it? 


I have already spoken about that. We had a tremendous threat of
profiteering in the shape of

Sukharevka,[4] with which we waged a constant
struggle. We understand, of course, that with the abolition of Sukharevka
profiteering still remains, it remains wherever there is a small
proprietor, and we have tens of millions of such proprietors. That is where
the real danger lies, and not in big capital, which will be hedged around
on all sides with special supervisions. It should not be forgotten that we
shall have an agreement which we can always cancel at the risk-our greatest
danger-of having to pay damages. 


What is the position with regard to tsarist debts? Will
   the Allies agree to any transactions unless these debts are paid? 


England already agrees not to demand the debts from us, since we have
proposed the draft of a trade agreement to them. Under that draft trade
deals are now starting and under it we are not obliged to repay debts. I
say, England agrees, but France does not. And so we tell France that in

    

principle we do not refuse. The exact amounts of payments will be discussed
at a conference, at which we intend to say: you, too, are responsible for
the losses you have caused us by your intervention. An ad hoc commission is
working on this question, and an initial estimate puts the figure at ten
thousand million in gold.

Speech To The R.C.P.(B.) Group

 At The Eighth Congress Of Soviets

 During The Debate

 On The Report

 Of The All-Russia Central Executive Committee

 And The Council Of People’s Commissars

 Concerning Home And Foreign Policies 
December 22

Comrades, allow me to begin by touching on certain remarks
made by speakers and answering notes, at least the more important
ones. From Comrade Korzinov’s criticism I have picked out the idea
concerning engineers and agronomists. We must push forward with the
training of engineers and agronomists from among the workers and
peasants. This is beyond all question, and the Soviet government is taking
steps in this direction, but we cannot count on very quick results; it may
not take as long as electrification, but it will take at least several
years; so it is wrong of Comrade Korzinov to suggest that all other matters
be set aside until we have our own agronomists. Bight now we have got to
find and get the best agronomists, call them to our meetings, demand from
them an account and thus single out the industrious and educated men from
the rest. 

Comrade Korzinov has landed in the opposition for opposition’s sake
when he says that the decree on concessions should have been published
earlier. But our work at the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council
of Labour and Defence is such that we have to react at once, and the

    

position with us is such that, given no differences of opinion in the
C.C. and C.P.C., decisions are taken at once. If the decree on concessions
is

wrong,[5] then we should propose its repeal, because the chief
concession with Vanderlip will not become a formal agreement until next
March. 

At the time we published this decree our main purpose was, and still
remains, to conclude a trade agreement as quickly as possible and offer the
bait of concessions to the capitalists. I dealt with this political aspect
of the case in my report to the R.C.P. group and heard no objections at the
time. I was therefore surprised when Comrade Ignatov, bent on being
opposition-minded, said that we had slipped up on Vanderlip, that we hadn’t
found out who he was. I read the statement by the Deputy People’s Commissar
for Foreign Trade that all inquiries concerning the group Vanderlip
represented had been made, had been confirmed abroad and remained
unrefuted. Vanderlip himself had pointed out that no agreement could be
concluded until after the presidential elections, when the Republican
candidate would take office, since such an agreement would have to be
sanctioned by the American Government. 

This is an agreement under which the American Government is to receive
a naval base. Consequently, even if this Washington Vanderlip, about whom
Comrade Ryazanov went into such irrelevant details-as often happens with
him-even if he did represent nobody and was just a swindler and the
proposed agreement was to provide for the Government of the United States
receiving a naval base aimed against Japan, there could be no question of
our being swindled, as the President of the United States would really be a
member of the Republican party. After Vanderlip we shall be in a position
to form a conclusive opinion about this trade agreement. Ignatov’s entire
criticism falls to the ground; he simply did not pay attention to what was
said at our meeting. 

Comrade Korzinov said that in the matter of Poland we should have given
warning earlier. We have here an extremely difficult situation, and there
was a moment when our troops were on the move and the Central Committee had
reason to believe that despite the complicated situation we could achieve
much by launching an offensive. 
 
At such a time when, after Curzon’s Note of

July 11,[6] we had to give a reply within a few days, how could we be
expected to call Party meetings to discuss the matter? Besides, every
comrade knows that if we could have passed over to an offensive war at the
right moment we would have done so without hesitation. And there would
never have been any opposition to it anywhere. What we did see was an
opposition in reverse, when we were accused of not pursuing a sufficiently
active foreign policy. That there have been mistakes here, there is no
doubt, but neither is there any doubt that arguing about them would be a
sheer waste of time, as we have other things to think of besides our old
activities. When time has receded, when all the documents and material will
have been collected, we shall be able to fully appreciate our
mistake. Therefore, I see nothing, absolutely nothing, in Comrade
Korzinov’s speech other than a desire to seek opposition. At another time,
when we are in more favourable conditions, we shall make the same use of
our successes. And so long as the Party does not forbid it, we shall always
assume the offensive. I don’t think that the Party or any of its members
will propose a reverse policy at any meeting. 

In regard to Comrade Gusev’s remark, I must say that I made a mistake
in introducing polemics in an official report, and therefore I have already
suggested that this part of the report be deleted from the official text
and greetings to Soviet Armenia added-through an unforgivable oversight on
my part this was omitted in the report. 

Comrade Gusev is wrong in saying that I boasted of my modesty-the point
is that in passing over to a more serious practical integration of the
economic commissariats and the implementation of a single economic plan,
the thing we had to be afraid of was project-mongering. 

Comrade Gusev says that I did not criticise his

booklet[7] as a whole. But that is the central point: Comrade Trotsky
and Comrade Rykov are invited to drop the departments and join the Council
of Defence, which, not being a depart-mental body, will set up a new
apparatus of its own. I cannot understand how, after three years of Soviet
rule, one can raise and support such a question here. I am at a loss for
words to express my perplexity. It is so ill-advised, it

    

means knocking down the department in one place and
setting it up in another. It means failure to understand what our apparatus
is. I don’t know whether Comrade Popov has managed to print the leaflet he
gave me. It contains an extract from the 1920 census results. You know that
this census has been satisfactorily carried out and has yielded a mass of
valuable information concerning the number of Soviet office employees in
Moscow. We took a similar census before this in 1919, but now we have a
fuller one. It shows that we have no less than 230,000 office employees, of
which 30,000, or even more, are in the most important commissariats, and
70,000 in the Moscow

Soviet.[8] Try to imagine these figures, ponder over them, and then
you will say to yourself-well, if you take an influential man, one who
enjoys the greatest authority and has created a certain style of work in
his department, take him out of that department and put him in charge of
several united departments, you can expect nothing but chaos. Is that the
way to fight bureaucratism? It is simply a frivolous attitude towards the
work, absolutely unrealistic. I understand what a serious thing
bureaucratism is, but no provision for its abolition is made in the Party
Programme. It is not a problem for a congress, it is a problem for a whole
epoch, and you have a special report devoted to this question. 

Does anyone really believe that by a mere stroke of the pen, by taking
comrades, who have created the best form of organisation in one or another
of the most important departments, and transferring them to the Council of
Labour and Defence, you will be getting a new department with indefinite
powers that will not perform economically unifying functions. When the
practical question arose in the Council of Labour and Defence as to what
was economic and what was not, not only the Foreign Trade Commissariat, but
the Finance Commissariat as well claimed that it was an economic
commissariat. And can you conduct any economic work without the
Commissariat for Public Health. Of course, when we shall have made big
progress in economic reconstruction the relation of economic commissariats
to non-economic ones may become different after we have achieved important
successes in the work of changing our economic foundations. At present we
have nothing of

    

the kind. Therefore, to treat the departmental question as
lightly as Gusev does-in other parts of the booklet, by the way, he repeats
some of the excellent ideas expressed in his previous

booklet[9]—is absolutely wrong. 

I shall say nothing about Ryazanov’s speech, which has been
sufficiently refuted by Kamenev. I shall merely mention that both Ryazanov
and Gusev, who has followed his bad example, have been talking about having
heard, perhaps from me in the Council of People’s Commissars, that I wanted
to, one said drown myself, the other said shoot myself. If comrades are
going to take a man at his angry word, uttered when he is very tired, and
make him speak about it before an audience of a thousand, I don’t think
these people can expect their speeches to be taken seriously. (


Applause.)  

It’s quite possible that we have a lot of vermicelli affairs in the
Council of People’s Commissars-that’s true. If Maximovsky has made this an
object on which to display his oppositionist bent and made a special point
of it, I must say there is not and cannot be any government institution
which does not have to deal with vermicelli affairs. You omitted to mention
that the C.C. dealt with questions involving policy. So long as the ruling
Party governs, so long as this Party has to decide all questions concerned
with various appointments, you will not allow important state appointments
to be made by anyone but the ruling party. When all is said and done, the
question of who is to make this or that policy is of secondary
importance. Hasn’t the C. C. vermicelli affairs? Plenty of them. Aren’t
there agendas, on completing which and running through a dozen items of
business, you would not only say you’d be glad to drown yourself, but
something worse still. I repeat, to catch me at this sort of statement is
not very difficult, but to come out here and make it an object for an
oppositionist stand and speak against vermicellism is frivolous. 

If, in a body which in general establishes only principles, we
attempted to set up a separate body to deal with petty, practical,
vermicelli affairs, we would only make things worse. Because we would be
tearing generalisation away from the facts of life, and such a break would
be sheer day-dreaming and frivolity. Questions in the Central Committee

    

cannot be divided into questions of principle and trivial questions,
because in every trifle a principle may be involved. 

It is not a question of Ivan or Sidor. It is not a question of putting
Sidor in Ivan’s place or vice versa. What if they refuse? What if this Ivan
and Sidor are both people’s commissars—what’s to be done then? The
C.C. has a Secretariat, an Orgbureau, a Politbureau, finally, plenums of
the Central Committee are held, and very often questions come before the
Central Committee Plenum that are as trivial and tedious as anything, and
some that you sit over for several hours until you feel like drowning
yourself. But to draw a line between trivial questions and questions of
principle is to undermine the very foundation of democratic centralism. At
the same time it cannot be said that the Central Committee dumps its
vermicelli onto other institutions. So far we have not been able to alter
the Constitution and have been working autonomously. The fact that on some
questions we have arrived at a agreement and on others there have been
debates is only natural and inevitable, considering the apparatus we
have. The fact that the C.C. is becoming an organ of control, and that in
the general distribution of work it has fallen to Comrade Kalinin to
supervise agitation and verification, and that he is required to give his
personal impressions obtained during his trips and at work—this gives no
grounds for shouting about the Council of People’s Commissars referring all
questions to the C.C and vice versa. It means introducing further
confusion and turmoil while things remain essentially unchanged. The
higher bodies are needed for the purpose of control and for turning down
certain questions. 

People here have spoken and complained about the Presidium of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee being swamped with business, and
though it is our highest body, it is swamped with purely vermicelli
affairs. But I would ask all those present here, how many of you have read
a dozen reports of our proceedings? Who has read them from beginning to
end? Probably no one, because they are dull, you can’t wade through them. I
must say that every member of our Party and every citizen of the Republic
has a right to bring any question, any circumstance, however trivial,
before the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. This

    

question will go through the whole ladder, through the bureau, etc. till it
gets to the C.E.C. Presidium, where it will be examined. And so it will be
until the complete communist re-education of the working people, which will
come within several decades after electrification has been finally
completed. In this respect we are not afraid of changes. 

I shall now deal with some of the notes. Comrade Minkin writes: 


Did Comrade Shlyapnikov inform the Council of People’s
   Commissars of the disgraceful goings on at the Commissariat for Foreign
   Trade, or was this being kept for announcement at the Congress? If he did
   make such a statement, what has been done to eliminate them? 


To answer this question I consulted Comrade Serebryakov who is better
informed than I am. He was appointed by the Central Committee to the
commission, the other members of which were Dzerzhinsky, Krestinsky and
Lezhava, set up to take steps towards improving the relations between the
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Commissariat for Internal Affairs,
since our representatives abroad had information that these relations were
anything but satisfactory. At my request Serebryakov gives the following
answer to the note of delegate Minkin: “Comrade Minkin states ...”
(reads). 

After this commission a subcommission was set up. It is very easy to
play at opposition, since there are disgraceful goings on with us in every
commissariat, and the infelicitous mention of guarantees and 30,000
employees in the commissariat’s technical publishing house is very
characteristic in the sense that you can always find scandalously
disgraceful things here. You will find the same thing in any division of
the Red Army. Nevertheless our Red Army has been winning victories all the
time. 

The thing is to apply in good time to the institution that has to
remedy matters, and not talk about it here, where we cannot collect
accurate information about what Comrade Ryazanov has heard of this or that
person and has not checked it or discovered the true facts. Is that
democratic centralism? It is not at all democratic, and not at all
centralism, but disorder and the introduction of chaos. Complaints should
be lodged with Party bodies. If that

    

body does not fulfil its duty it should be made to give a strict account of
itself. 

Among the notes that have been sent up there is the question of
reducing the army. On this subject Comrade Trotsky will make a special
statement, and you will decide whether this question should be dealt with
today or at the next special meeting of the R.C.P. group. I can tell you
that after an ad hoc commission on demobilisation headed by Trotsky and
Dzerzhinsky was set up, the C.C. decided to start demobilisation, and this
is now going on. It is being dealt with by the military department, and you
will receive an exact report. 


Is the Council of Labour and Defence regarded as an
   interim body called upon to unite the economic commissariats and then to be
   abolished, or i it the basis of a future integrated economic plan? Also, on
   what apparatus does the Council rely locally? 


This question has not been settled, and we believe that to raise it now
would be a waste of time. The order of the day now is a check-up of the
organisation of the commissariats. The Council of People’s Commissars has
set up an organisational body which is to revise the apparatus of the
People’s Commissariats with a view to the tasks confronting them, and in
this connection, to examine the question of staffs. To busy ourselves at
the present time with setting up another apparatus in place of the Council
of Labour and Defence is impossible until the question of electrification
is settled. Various material on electrification will soon be handed out to
you, and the Council of Labour and Defence will have to reckon with what
the verification of this material and the reports will have to say. We now
have an organ that we need, and, good or bad, we have in any case been
working with it and coping with the tasks confronting us. We have no
intention of embarking on reforms until we have practically tested how the
integrated economic plan will be carried out. This is definitely a case of
look before you leap. 


Who is going to conclude concession contracts in the Far
   East, we or the buffer state, in either case—why? 


This, comrades, is a delicate question. Buffer

state[10]—it is such an embarrassing definition when we are asked:

    

You or the buffer? On the one hand we have the buffer, on the other, the
corresponding Party Bureau of the R.C.P. The buffer’s a buffer, it’s to
enable us to win time and then beat the Japanese. I don’t know whom
Kamchatka belongs to. Actually the Japanese are in possession, and they do
not relish the idea of our giving it away to the Americans. We, are
consulted, our directives are complied with, and nobody has protested
against our negotiations with Vanderlip, no single group of Party comrades
has considered the question important enough to demand its being discussed
at the plenum of the Central Executive Committee and examined in the
Control Commission. This is the right of every Party member, and no one has
used this right. The person who has learned the facts which led to the
postponement of an agreement till March will not try to make use of this
right. 


What is your view of the trade unions at the present
   moment in connection with the concessions? Is it true that you stand for
   the organisation of a trade union of peasants? 


I must say that the Party’s Programme mentions the necessity of seeking
new forms of trade unions that would unite the poor sections of the

peasantry.[11] This task has been posed in the Party’s
Programme and I have often pointed out that although we are not in a
position at present to solve this problem, we must not give it up. We must
not confine ourselves to the work of

Vserabotzem,[12] which is so weak, and which cannot give us outstanding
workers. So long as we have a levelling process taking place among the
peasantry, a levelling and unification of the working peasants, the
non-kulak section of the peasantry, this problem cannot be removed from the
order o the day of socialist construction. To strengthen the work of the
trade unions we must extend them not only to the rural proletariat, but to
all the working peasantry. How this is to be done we do not know yet. We
have set this task in the Party’s Programme, we shall return to it many
times and get it settled in a practical manner from different aspects. That
is all I can say now on this question. 

With the granting of concessions, the trade unions, naturally, will
have important tasks imposed upon them-those

    

or checking, supervising, and maintaining contact with the workers who will
be employed in these concessions. How this task will be handled in
practice, I cannot say at the moment. To raise this question at the present
time would be inadvisable, as the trade unions have more important tasks
facing them. 

In our fight against bureaucratism we certainly need the help of the
trade unions. We must rely on them. This is basically provided for in the
Party’s

Programme.[13] This shows what a long struggle is needed and what
systematic work faces us. When we shall have data that in such-and-such a
workmen’s settlement the business of supervision is organised in
such-and-such a way and definite results have been achieved, while in
such-and-such a block, uyezd, etc. things are different-then we shall be
able to weigh things, get them moving, and there will not only be talk
about the “agitpotato” but we shall be in a position to check what steps
have been taken in practice and on this ground apply practical measures
that have already yielded results.

Speech On Addenda To The Bill Of The C.P.C.

 “On Measures To Consolidate And Develop

 Peasant Farming”

 Delivered To The B.C.?. Group

 Of The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 27

Comrades, the Central Committee today has examined the decision adopted
by the group concerning the deletion of the words “individual
householders” from the point of the resolution on agriculture which deals
with improvement and premiums. The C.C. has passed the following resolution
and authorised me to defend

it.[14] (Reads.) There, comrades, you have the text of
the C.C.’s decision. Allow me now to

    

give the reasons why we simply could not agree with the group’s
decision. We had no doubts, and this was particularly stressed at the
C.C. meeting, that the principal reasons the group was guided by in its
decision to reject the idea of premiums for individual householders were
the fear that we would give premiums to the kulak, and the desire to give
priority to the village commune, the volost, the collective unit—to
common labour, not the individual. With this we are in perfect
agreement. We consider, however, that it would be wrong to let ourselves
reject altogether the idea of premiums for individual farmers for reasons,
which in themselves are quite correct, fundamentally indisputable to any
Marxist and especially valuable from the point of view of the
peasantry. 

Allow me to give you some information from the history of the origin of
this bill. I have been following its progress through the Council of
People’s Commissars fairly closely and must say that in the first draft,
tabled by the Food Commissariat, the main accent, generally speaking, was
on the hardworking farmer. The gist of Comrade Sereda’s proposals was that
it would be wrong to stake on the hard-working farmer, and that we should
stake on the village commune, the collective body. The Council’s attitude
on this question-at least, mine-was that we had to weigh all the pros and
cons and consult the local people. Indeed, it seemed wrong to me to reject
premiums for individual farmers, but that the village commune had to be
given priority-this might be all right if the local people with practical
experience confirmed that it could and should be done. From this conflict
of two points of view there emerged the formulation that was adopted for
the bill of the Council of People’s Commissars, namely, that both be
retained and a ratio established between the two kinds of premiums. The
details, as defined in the Council, were to be covered by instructions. In
fact the decision of the Council says that the instructions are to be drawn
up within a definite stated period by the Commissariat for Agriculture,
co-ordinated with the Commissariat for Food and endorsed by the Council of
People’s Commissars. As an exception to the general procedure, when
instructions are endorsed by a single order of the People’s Commissar
concerned,

    

we arranged not only for verification—the participation of two People’s
Commissars-but specially added that the Council of People’s Commissars
demanded that the instructions be submitted to it for
endorsement. Obviously, a great deal depended on the instructions. 

After certain explanations given by comrades your decision not to give
premiums to individual farms became clear to us. The Central Committee saw
the point. The point is fear of unfair premiums, the giving of premiums to
kulaks. Obviously, the best-run farms are those of the well-to-do peasants
and the kulaks, and there are still plenty of these in the villages, on
that score we haven’t the slightest doubt. If we, in paying a premium for
an efficient farm, did not take care to find out how that efficiency was
achieved, then, naturally, the kulak would prove to have the best-run
farm. And if we ignore the question as to how, at what price, economic
improvement is achieved, we shall find the kulak receiving unfair
privileges. If we reward him with the means of production, that is, with
things that make for farm expansion, we shall find ourselves indirectly,
and perhaps even not quite indirectly, boosting the kulaks, because, in
rewarding an industrious farmer without considering whether or not he
achieved his good results by kulak practices, and what is more, rewarding
him with things like the means of production, that is to say, things he can
use to strengthen his influence with, we shall, of course, be running
counter to the basic provisions of not only the agrarian, but of all Soviet
policy, and infringing the basic principle—that of supporting the
interests of the working people against those of the kulaks. In doing so we
shall really be seriously undermining the principles and foundations of
all Soviet policy in general, and not only of agrarian policy. 

But if we are to draw from this the conclusion that individual farmers
should not be rewarded, then take the following example: we give bonuses to
individual workers at factories and mills, where collective, socialised,
labour has reached an incomparably higher level than in agriculture. What
is to be done about the peasantry then? In a peasant country, where
individual peasant labour predominates to the extent of nine-tenths,
probably ninety-nine per cent, where

    

we have twenty million peasant farms, we want to promote these farms and we
must do so come what may. We know that their efficiency can he raised only
after several long years of radical technical reform. We have learned
something in our three years of practical work. We know how to build up the
foundations of communism in agriculture—this can be done at the cost of a
tremendous technical evolution. We clearly visualise that elaborated plan
with located electric stations, we know the minimum-programme, the
programme for the next ten years, but in this book on electrification we
also have a maximum-programme, in which gigantic work is planned for years
ahead. But now we have twenty million separate farms, which are run
separately and cannot be run in any other way; and if we don’t encourage
them to raise productivity this would be grossly wrong, it would be clearly
overdoing it, it means a refusal to see facts of reality that strike the
eye, facts that we have to reckon with and be guided by. It would be
desirable, of course, to have these farms rise through collectivism, by
whole volosts, communes, etc. But how far that is possible at present is a
thing we have to reckon with. If you, working in the local areas, support
progress in this direction and raise a whole commune or a whole
volost—all the better; in that case give them all that is best in premium
payments. But are you sure that you will manage it, that it is not sheer
fantasy, which in the practical work will lead to the greatest blunders?


That is why we propose to you the last part of the



C.C’s resolution
reworded or amended as the practical workers may deem fit for inclusion in
the resolution of the Congress of Soviets, so that this question should be
decided by you and you should say here: premiums and rewards for individual
farmers are acceptable under three known conditions. First, premiums for
rural communes first and foremost, with householders coming second and
receiving what remains—to this we agree. The second point says individual
farmers who have achieved economic success by kulak practices should not be
rewarded; it should not be a case of-you have made a go of it economically,
you are to be rewarded. If anyone has achieved economic success, but
employed a kulak method in doing so, whether in the form

    

of a loan, the hiring of labourers, or profiteering—kulak practices
sometimes dodge the law-if anyone has employed the slightest kulak method
to achieve success, he is to forfeit reward of any kind. This is the second
restriction which goes still further to meet your principled point of view
as to combating the kulaks and supporting the working middle peasants and
poor peasants. The third restriction—what is to be issued as
premiums. They may be given in the form of means of production—things
like implements and machines that serve to expand and improve the farm;
articles of consumption may be issued, household articles of adornment,
things that make the home brighter and life more beautiful. We say: “Give
the individual farmers only consumer and household goods, and, of course,
medals.”  You have already accepted the Order of the Red

Banner.[15] As to the means of production, these may be given to
individual farmers, but of such a type and on such conditions that they
should not be usable for kulak purposes. No machines should be given, not
even to the most hardworking farmer, not even if he has achieved success
without the least resort to kulak practices. Machines should not be given,
because by the very nature of their employment they require collective
labour, and a farmer who receives a machine will not be able to use it by
himself. 

These are the considerations the C.C. was guided by and on the basis of
which we have asked you to reconsider your decision, exchange opinions, and
alter your decision if you deem it possible so as to allow individual
farmers to be rewarded on the three conditions set forth above. If we do
not accept this, we may not achieve needed results, since farm improvements
cannot be carried out in a tired and ruined country without a special
effort, and the hardworking farmers have to be rewarded. All hard work that
contains no element of kulak practices should be rewarded. That is why we
think that on considering these reasons you will agree to premiums subject
to the three restrictive conditions mentioned above, which we think are
really necessary in the interests of our economic development.

Reply To Questions At The Meeting

 Of The R.C.P. Group

 Of The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 27

Before answering the notes it must be stated definitely
whether a formal difference of opinion exists between the congress group
and the Central Committee. Dealing with what the first speakers have said
here: we adopted a definite decision, intending to fight the kulaks, but at
that time you did not have the methods of struggle outlined by us in the
three addenda. What did the comrades who, opposed these addenda say here?
As a matter of fact they said nothing. The peasant Red Armyman who spoke

here[16] said that the kulaks exist and they are growing, but we say
definitely: if they are kulaks they will receive no reward. You are being
asked to make that a law. Moreover, if the middle peasant achieves
betterment individually, but may use it to become a kulak, he is not to
receive a premium. What argument, then, has been advanced here against our
reasons?  None at all. It is reiterated that the kulak should not be
rewarded. But we agree to that. 

I shall deal now with the notes that have been sent up. The first one:



   1) What will be the criterion for a “hardworking kulak”
   and a “hardworking middle peasant”? 

   2) If we do find that criterion here and work out a plan,
   how are we going to carry it out locally, all the more in places where the
   kulaks are still playing the leading role? 

   3) Where is the line to be drawn between rewarding a
   whole collective body and an individual farmer, or are both of them to be
   rewarded? 


For one thing, the peasants know this better than we do. If the law
bans any reward for people employing kulak practices, then this is broader
than the notion of the kulak. The kulak is a man who generally uses kulak
methods, and one or another kulak method is used by almost every middle
peasant. That means we not only forbid premiums being given to kulaks but
to any middle peasant as well, if he uses kulak methods, and these methods
are endless

    

in their variety. That crude method by which an extra horse was
bought for five poods is not the only

one.[17] Would a premium be given to a kulak like that? What makes you
think that people in the country will close their eyes to this? As to the
criterion for a hardworking kulak and a hard-working middle peasant, the
local people know this perfectly well. We have no intention of writing a
law about this, as it would mean writing a whole volume describing kulak
practices, and people locally know this perfectly well. 

Secondly, haven’t we got uyezd committees of the Party, won’t this
thing be handled by the rural commune, by the volost land departments, by
the Party cell? How can we speak about fighting the kulaks in the local
areas if there are no fighting cells there? This argument is beyond
me. 

Thirdly, the law says that priority is given to the collective body
with the individual farmer coming second. The differentiation will be made
in greater detail by the Uyezd Party Committee and all the other bodies
that exist locally. 

The second note: 


In introducing its amendment does the CC. regard it as a
   political act, an incentive to the “hardworking peasants” to improve
   farming and industry in general so as to make it easier in the course of
   time to introduce collective cultivation? Will you please answer this? 


In the first place, here is proof that there is nothing specially
political in this question, something that should be kept from the
non-Party peasants. Therefore I consider it quite right and think it should
be made a custom to invite non-Party people to our group meetings on such
questions. They will have no right of decision at the group meetings, but
why not consult them? Our economic practice has shown that it is advisable
to go over from individual to collective labour, but having experienced
what this going means, we should not try to take it in our stride, but try
to understand the need for doing it, the slower the going the better. 

The third note: 


I think the advocates of commune premiums ought to be
   asked whether they have enough ploughs and other implements to reward the
   commune with or not. If not, it’s not worth talking about. 


This argument is incorrect. Generally speaking, we have few articles
usable as premiums, and so few ploughs that,

    

as means of production, we shall not give them to individuals, but only to
whole communes But why should we not, if we can, give a plough to a peasant
who has worked hard to raise productivity? And who is to decide whether he
is a kulak element or not? We must lend an ear to what people say lower
down. 

The next note: 


Will you please, if possible, answer the following
   question right now on the back of this note. The Svyatiye Kresty Uyezd,
   Stavropol Gubernia, where I work, has had 10,000,000 poods of grain imposed
   on it for delivery by December 1,1920. We have delivered 3,200,000
   poods. Owing to poor fulfilment we are widely practising confiscation of
   property from kulak elements, and so I ask you again, will you please tell
   us what we are to do? Should we carry out confiscation, or do it only as a
   last resort, so as not to ruin the farm? 


This has no relation to the law we are discussing. Go on acting the way
you have been doing. In strict conformity with the decree of the Soviet
government and your own communist conscience go on freely acting the way
you have been doing till now. 

The next note.: 


How is the “hardworking kulak” to be distinguished from
   the concept of “hardworking peasant”? 


Our bill covers all that, and your asking this is an abuse of question
time. 

Next we are asked: 


Who can define a hardworking peasant and how, say in any village? If
   this is to be done by elected or authorised persons in the village, it will
   mean an abuse of elected and authorised persons. 


I have already said that we must make use of our Party. We have the
Committees of Poor Peasants, and in the Ukraine we have their
counterpart. 


   1) Please consider this. Peasant farmers were given a
   premium for delivering hemp in 1920. They received 100 arshins of textiles
   each, but the village poor haven’t received an arshin yet for 1920. 

   2) Is the fact taken into consideration that the system
   of premiums to individual farmers is an obstacle in the way of setting up
   collective farms and partly bolsters up the shaken foundations of
   capitalism in agriculture? 


Comrades, you know that individual peasant farms with us are the
foundations of capitalism, in a manner of speaking.

    

There is no doubt about that, and I pointed this out in my report, when I
said straight out that the “Sukharevka” we had to fear was not the one
that existed on Sukharevka Square or existed secretly on any other square,
but the one that sits in the breast of every individual peasant farmer.* *
See p. 247 of this volume.-Ed. Can we get away from this in a year or two
years? We cannot. But farming has to be improved right now. You are guided
by excellent communist motives, but you want to jump from this floor to
that top, and we say-it won’t work, act more carefully and gradually 

Further: 


Why don’t the Food Commissariat and other institutions
   give food products for bonuses to workers of Group 3? 


I don’t know why, but I should imagine it’s because we have terribly
little food products available for bonus payments. 


Will you kindly answer this question: What does the
   C.C. of the R.C.P. think of the idea of rewarding the more well-to-do
   peasants, i.e., those who have large allotments which they work themselves?
   And at the same time, how do the land-poor peasants stand who have no
   chance of giving a good account of themselves because they have so little
   land? 


Why does he have a large allotment? If it is unfair, why does the
commune or the Land Department let him keep it? Because others are not able
to cultivate it. So why punish him, if he works hard on it? If he uses
kulak methods, don’t let him do it, if he holds the allotment unfairly,
take it away from him and give it to others, to those who will work it, but
don’t blame a man for having a lot of land. In Russia there is no private
property, the land is distributed by you yourselves and by, the commune. In
Russia there are people who have large amounts of land. If the Party
committee and the Soviet bodies see this and do nothing about it, they
should be given the sack, but people should not be deprived of their
premiums. 

Two more notes. The first: 


Will this point of the bill apply to the Ukraine? 

 

I think it will, and I very much regret that not a single one of the
comrades working in the Ukrainian Poor Peasants’ Committees has spoken
here. I think the premature closing of the debate a great mistake. 

The second one: 


If the R.C.P. congress group rejects the resolution of
   the CC. shall we be worthy members of the R.C.P. or just showing our
   obstinacy? 


My answer to this note is a document called “Rules of the Russian
Communist Party”. In Clause 62 of this document we read: “On matters
relating to its inner life and current work the group is

autonomous.”[18] This means that all members of the group have the
right and are bound to vote according to their conscience and not on the
instructions of the C.C. If, in voting according to your conscience, you
pass a second decision against the C.C’s proposal, we are obliged, on the
basis of Clause 62, to summon the Central Committee, and we shall do so at
once, and you will send your representatives to attend its meeting. A
serious question like this were best discussed two or three times to iron
out serious differences of opinion between us. That is how matters stand,
that is how we have to act. You have to vote now, not because the higher
Party body has issued directives, but because you have either been
persuaded or you have not. 

Comrades here were wrong to say that things must have been in a poor
way if Lenin has been sent to speak up for them. This is not true. The
Party Rules define your rights exactly. That’s one thing. Secondly, it
isn’t true because there was not a single difference of opinion on this
question in the Central Committee, which said outright: We have been
carried away by our struggle against the kulaks and have forgotten
measure. Let us remind people about measure. 

The C.C. appointed two comrades because these two members of the
C.C. had occasion, during the discussion of the bill, to take a more active
part in it than others and spoke in the debates. I handled all the drafts,
and so did Preobrazhensky. That’s why the two of us were appointed.

Addenda To The Resolution On The Agrarian Question 

Premiums to individual householders should, 

first, come second compared with premiums to whole communes and
collective bodies generally: 

second, individual householders should be given premiums and generally
rewarded only on the strict condition that the individual farmers have
achieved their economic successes without the slightest use of kulak
methods; 

third, that individual householders receive premiums in the shape of
medals, consumer goods, household goods, and so on; premiums in the shape
of means of production are permissible for individual householders
strictly on condition that only such means of production are issued as
could under no circumstance be instrumental in turning the farmer into a

kulak.[19]

[2]
The Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’,
Peasants’, Red Army and Cossack Deputies was held in Moscow from December
22 to 29, 1920. There was a record attendance of 2,537 delegates, of whom
1,728 had a vote and 809 a consultative voice. Of the total number of
detcgates 91.7 per cent were Communists, 2.7 per cent sympathisers, 3.9 per
cent non-Party people, 0.3 per cent Mensheviks, 0.3 per cent Bundists, 0.15
per cent Left S.Rs, 0.15 per cent anarchists, and 0.8 per cent from other
parties. The questions on the agenda were: Report on the Work of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s
Commissars; Electrification of Russia; Rehabilitation of Industry and
Transport; Development of Agricultural Production and Assistance to Peasant
Farming; Improving the Work of Soviet Agencies and Combating
Bureaucratism. The principal questions on the agenda were discussed
beforehand at meetings of the R.C.P. group. The congress set up three
sections, on industry, agriculture and state organisation, to thrash out
these problems. 

At the plenary sessions of the congress Lenin delivered
a report on December 22 on the work of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, and a speech on December
23 winding up the debate on this question. He also took the floor six times
at meetings of the Communist group of the congress (December 21, 22, 24 and
27) on the question of concessions and during the debate of the bill on
measures to strengthen and develop peasant farming. See also present
edition, Vol. 31, pp. 463-534.  



[3]
By a decision of the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
dated December 8, 1920, The Tenth Congress of the Party was to be convened
in February 1921. In January, at the request of local organisations, the
CC. decided to postpone the convocation of the Congress till March. 



[4]
Sukharevka—a market-place  in Moscow. During
the years of foreign military intervention and civil war it was a centre
and symbol of black marketeering. It was closed down in 1932. 



[5]
Lenin is referring to the Decree of the Council of
People’s Commissars on Concessions dated November 23, 1920. It was
published in Izvestia  No. 265 (1112) on November 25, 1920. 



[6]
Curzon’ a Note was a result of the successes of the Red
Army, which had ousted the White Polish invaders from the Ukraine and
Byelorussia in the summer of 1920. To hold up the advance of the Red Army
and prevent a possible collapse of bourgeois Poland and defeat of Wrangel,
the British Government sent a Note to Soviet Russia on July 11, 1920,
signed by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon. The Note in the form
of an ultimatum demanded that the advance of the Red Army be stopped, that
an armistice be concluded with Poland, and that the war with Wrangel should
be terminated. The British Government offered to act as mediator and on
behalf of the Allies’ Supreme Council threatened, in the event of the
ultimatum being rejected, to assist Poland “with all the means at its
disposal”.  

In its reply, based on Lenin’s proposals, the Soviet
Government firmly rejected Curzon’s mediation and insisted on direct
negotiations with Poland. The Soviet Government protested against Britain’s
attempt to annex the Crimea and agreed to guarantee the personal safety of
Wrangel and his troops only on condition that they surrender immediately
and completely. 



[7]
This refers to the booklet Yediny Icliozyaistvenny
plan i yediny khozyaistvenny apparat  (An Integrated Economic Plan and
an Integrated Economic Apparatus) by S. I. Gusev, published in 1920 with a
view to the forthcoming Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 



[8]
This figure gives the number of employees in all
administrative, economic and cultural institutions, which were then run by
the Moscow Soviet.  



[9]
Lenin is referring to Gusev’s booklet Ocherednige
voprosy khozga- istvennogo stroitelstva  (Immediate Problems of
Economic Development. (On, CC., R.C.P. Theses.) Materials for the Ninth
Party Congress published in 1920.  



[10]
This refers to the Far-Eastern Republic. 

In the autumn of 1920 Washington Vanderlip,
representing the U. S. Vanderlip Syndicate, conducted negotiations in
Moscow for a concession on fishing and the prospecting and extraction of
oil and coal in Kamchatka and other parts of Siberia east of the 160th
meridian. At the end of October an agreement was drafted under which the
Syndicate was to receive a concession for a term of sixty years. On the
expiry of 35 years the Soviet Government was entitled to buy out all
concession enterprises, and on the expiry of the agreed term the
enterprises with their equipment in full running order were to be made over
without compensation to the R.S.F.S.R. The Syndicate, however did not
receive the support of the U.S. Administration and financial tycoons and
the agreement was never signed. 



[11]
Lenin apparently has in mind the following section of
the Programme of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). ,In all its work
in the countryside the R.C.P. continues to rely on the proletarian and
semi-proletarian elements, organises them first of all into an independent
force by creating Party cells in the countryside, organisations of the poor
peasants, a special type of trade unions with a membership of rural
proletarians and semi-proletarians, and so on, bringing them as close
together as possible to the urban proletariat and tearing them away from
under the influence of the rural bourgeoisie and petty proprietary
interests (The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses,
Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part I, 1954,
p. 425). 



[12]
The full name is Vser’abotzemles, standing for Farm and
 Forest Workers’ Trade Union.  



[13]
Lenin is referring to the section of the Bolshevik
Party Pragramme which says: “The participation of the trade unions in
running the economy and drawing the broad masses into this activity is at
the same time a chief means of struggle against the bureaucratisation of
the economic apparatus of Soviet power and makes for a truly popular
control over the results of production” (The C.P.S. U. in Resolutions
and Decisions of Congresses, Confe-rences and Plenary Meetings of the
Central Committee, Part I. 



[14]
During the discussion of the draft resolution of the
Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, “On Measures to Consolidate and
Develop Peasant Farming” the Communist group at the congress declared for
the elimination of the points concerning personal premiums for individual
farmers. On December 27, 1920, the C.C.  at a plenary meeting, examined
this question, pointed out that the congress group had adopted an erroneous
decision and suggested that it be revised. The plenum adopted Lenin’s
motion defining the conditions and principles for rewarding individual
farmers (sec pp. 266-67 of this volume). The plenum authorised Lenin to
deliver a report on this question before the congress group. After Lenin’s
speech the group withdrew its former decision. 



[15]
The Order of the Red Banner  was instituted by
a decision of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets as an award to
groups of working people and individual citizens who displayed conspicu-
ous devotion, initiative, industry and self-discipline in tackling economic
problems.  



[16]
The person referred to was Yeryomin, a delegate to the
Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 



[17]
Lenin’s speech at the congress group meeting (see
p. 257-61 of this volume) was followed by debates, in which Red Armyman
Yeryomin, a middle peasant, tried to prove that the kulaks would be able
all the same to take the poor peasants’ farming implements and horses away
from them. He cited an example of Kozlov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia, where the
starving peasant poor were compelled to sell their horses to the kulaks for
five poods of grain.

 Comrade Krestinsky 

I propose: 

1) that Kamenev and his commission

(+Stalin)[1] be given a formal assignment from the
Politbureau, this to be entered in the minutes. 

2) that Chervyakov be instructed to urgently draft
a detailed letter of the C.C., R.C.P. on Byelorussia and a
decree of the C.P.C. on the same subject

(confidential).[2]. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to what is known as the Federal Commission headed by
L. B. Kamenev. The commission was engaged in preparing questions involving
state relations among the Soviet Republics. 



[2]
These proposals were written on Chicherin’s letter to the Poutbureau
dated December 30, 1920. Chicherin reported that A, G. Chervyakov, Chairman
of the Council of People’s Commissars of Byelorussia, pointed out the
extremely abnormal situation that existed as a result of the unsettled
state relations between Byelorussia and the R.S.F.S.R., which made
co-operation between the Republics difficult. Chicherin expressed the
opinion that an agreement should be concluded with Byelorussia similar to
that concluded with the Ukraine.  

The question of an agreement on alliance between Soviet Byelorussia and
the R.S.F.S.R. was raised by the Byelorussian Patty and administrative
bodies in the autumn of 1920. Following the negotiations at the end of
December 1920 and the beginning of January 1921, an agreement on workers’
and peasants’ alliance between the R.S.F.S.R. and the Soviet Socialist
Republic of Byelorussia was signed on January 16, and endorsed by the
Central Executive Committee of Byelorussia on January 21, 1921.

At the Second Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of
the Eighth Convocation (March 19-20, 1921) the question of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture was not discussed.  The session dealt with the
question of regulations governing the people’s commissariats. In the
decision on this question the ultimate date was fixed for submitting to the
Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. for approval regulations governing the
people’s commissariats and their agencies.

To Point 3 

1) The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to be
directed to defer a break with Georgia, to systematically collect material
concerning her violations of the agreement and to press our demands for
transit of supplies to Armenia. 

2) The Caucasian Front to be asked for information as to
the state of preparedness of our available armed forces in the event of an
immediate or imminent war with Georgia, this inquiry, mentioning Georgia’s
growing insolence, to be drafted by a committee consisting of Comrades
Trotsky, Chicherin and Stalin. 

3) Directives to be issued to the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic and the Caucasian Front to be prepared for an
emergency involving war with Georgia. The

       S.C.R.F.[1]

to report as soon as possible to the Council

    

of Labour and Defence on the possibility of increasing troop transportation
to and within the

Caucasus.[3]

[2]
On January 26, 1921, the C.C. plenum examined the question of Georgia
(this question stood third on the agenda, hence Lenin’s heading “To Point
3”). The discussion of this question followed hostile acts against the
Soviet Republic by the Menshevik Government of Georgia. In violation of her
agreement with the R.S.F.S.R.  of May 7, 1920, Georgia put a ban on the
transit of goods from the R.S.F.S.R. through her territory, among them food
supplies for the famine-stricken population of Armenia. She refused to
return the R.S.F.S.R. the more valuable of the Russian ships formerly held
by Wrangel, which put in at Georgian ports after his defeat. She took
repressive measures against members of the Russian embassy staff, insulted
the national flag of the R.S. F.S. R.  and provoked and encouraged
counter-revolutionary acts against the Soviet authorities in the Northern
Caucasus. In connection with these violations of the agreement
representatives of the R.S.F.S.R. lodged repeated official protests, but
the Georgian government ignored them.  



[3]
Lenin’s draft was incorporated without amendment in the reso-lution of
the plenum, where it figures as Point “a”. Point “b” read: “The
Caucasian Front to be directed to examine the question of any real
guarantees (a control commission, etc.) that we could demand from the
Georgian Government through diplomatic channels as a safeguard against
assistance being given by Georgia to insurgents in Daghestan and Chechen”
(Central Patty Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC. of
the C.P.S.U.).

The question being quite clear, I propose that we confine
ourselves to questioning of members of the C.C. I move the following
resolution: 


   “That at such short notice on the eve of the congress
   (both the congress of Tsektran and the congress of the R.C.P.) it is
   absolutely impossible and inadmissible to release anyone from work. The
   slightest instance of any “persecution”, i.e., any polemics detrimental
   to the work of transport, which develop into attacks
   destructive of discipline


   will be severely punished by the C.C, which asks that all such instances be
   brought to its notice.”

Notes
 
 



[1]
Tsektran-Central Committee  of the Joint Trade Union of Rail
and Water Transport Workers. On January 26, 1021, thirteen members of
Tsektran wrote to the C.C. of the R.CP.(B.) asking to be relieved of their
duties as members of the Union’s Central Committee. One of the reasons
given was that criticism of Tsektran’s methods of work during the trade
union controversy allegedly created an impression among railwaymen and
water transport workers that the Central Committee of the Party censured
the whole past and present activities of Tsektran. The signatories
described criticism of the work of Tsektran as persecution on the part of a
group of water transport workers as well as of some members of the Party’s
C.C. and of the Presidium of the A.C.C.T.U.  Lenin’s motion in connection
with the letter was adopted by the Politbureau on January 31.

proposals: ’a) Approve in principle the granting of oil concessions in
Grozay and Baku and other operative oilfields and start and speed up
negotiations. b) The Supreme Economic Counpil to be directed to send a
highly competent commission of first-class oil-industry experts to Baku and
Grozny to investigate the question of ensuring oil extraction and

      fivefold.[1]

2) The C.P.C. directs the Council of Labour and Defence
immediately to set up a General Planning Commission with the participation

and revising it with an eye to the practical use to which the purchases can
be put under our present economic conditions. Final approval of the plan by

with the indispensable condition that priority be given to the requirements
of the fuel extracting and metallurgical industries. Exceptions with the

Personally to the Members of the C.L.D. from Comrade
  Lenin

As I am submitting to the C.L.D. tomorrow (18/1 L) a draft
decision concerning a General Planning Commission, I herewith present to
you, for your information, a draft of the main point of this decision and
a preliminary list of members

    

(drawn up after consultation with Comrades Rykov and

   Krzhizhanovsky)[1]

.

Please prepare your amendments or counter-proposals for the meeting of the
C.L.D. on 18/II. 

A General Planning Commission is being set up under the C.L.D. to work
out an integrated state economic plan on the basis of the electrification
plan approved by the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets and to effect
general supervision of this plan’s realisation. 

The primary economic tasks, especially those which have to be carried
out in the near future, in the course of 1921, are to be elaborated by the
General Planning Commission or its subcommission in the greatest possible
detail, full account being taken of prevailing economic conditions. 
 

Notes
 

[1]
See Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 24.—Ed. 
 



[2]
At the meeting of the Council of Labour and Defence on February 18 no
decision on setting up such a commission was passed. A shorthand record of
the meeting was not kept. Only Lenin’s brief notes of the debate and his
notes for a winding-up speech have come down to us (see Lenin
Miscellany  XX, pp. 20-22). Judging by these notes and the article
"Integrated Economic Plan" (see Vol. 32 of this edition, pp. 137-45) the
speakers against a plannin commission were Y. Larin, V. P. Milyutin,
N. Osinsky an A. I. Rykov. This question was referred to the Council of
People’s Commissars.  The present draft written by Lenin was incorporated
completely in the "Regulations on the State Planning Commission", which
were endorsed by the C.P.C. on February 22, 1921, together with a list of
commission members drawn up by Lenin (see Lenin  Miscellany
XX, p..  24). The State Planning Commission was set up on the basis of
the GOELRO (the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia) and
headed by G. M. Krzhizhanovsky.

I am rather surprised at the nature of today’s talk. I
don’t think this is the right political moment for it. We have to cope with
the present situation, which has deteriorated both internally and
internationally. Peace with Poland has not yet been concluded, and at home
we have a growth of banditism and kulak revolts. As for food and fuel,
thinks have gone from bad to worse. Last year we consumed 15 million poods
of grain during the first half-year and 8 million in the second; this year
we have used 25 million poods in the first half-year and are now obliged to
cut the bread rations and are not even sure we shall be able to issue them
regularly. Obviously our mistake was that we wrongly distributed the grain
in the first half-year; we should not have increased its consumption to 25
million poods. There are no deliveries from Siberia now, because the kulak
rebels have cut off the railway. Our Siberian comrades spoke of the
possibility of

    

a kulak uprising, but it is very difficult to determine the extent of
it. It is not a war, in which one can weigh the forces engaged in it. The
Siberian peasantry are not yet used to privations, although they are
bearing less than the peasantry of European Russia, and there is now a
break off in communications with Siberia and stoppage of
deliveries. Between March 1 and 10, approximately, there will be no
improvement in the food situation. We have left ourselves no stocks. The
thing now is to hold out, to bear the present situation with the greatest
possible firmness. There is a certain improvement in deliveries from the
Caucasus, but there is a likelihood that things may get worse. Apparently
the uprising in Armenia will quieten

down,[2] but deliveries from the Caucasus can in no way compensate us
for non-deliveries from Siberia, although pressure is being put on the
South-Eastern Railway to make up the losses. This is sad news, but it can’t
be helped. 

In the banditism one feels the influence of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Their main forces are abroad; every spring they
dream of overthrowing Soviet power. Chernov wrote about this recently in a
Russian newspaper abroad. The S.R.s are connected with the local
instigators. This connection is to be seen in the fact that the uprisings
take place in the very districts from which we take grain. The
surplus-appropriation system here met with tremendous difficulties. The same
system is being applied in Siberia, but there they still have stocks left
over from previous years. 

The deterioration has spread to fuel as well. We have no exact figures,
so no clear deductions can be made, nor can we determine the causes of the
fuel crisis. 

We have come to the conclusion that there exists discontent of a
general nature. This discontent has to be caught from below, directly
through the Party apparatus if it cannot be caught quickly through the
administrative apparatus. 

In addition to signs of bureaucratism, there are mistakes in the
plan. The plan should be checked when it is drawn up by being discussed in
the press and at meetings. We are obliged to stop enterprises and thereby
upset the work of factories which do have fuel. What is the matter?
Clearly, besides mistakes, the plan contains material for legal
proceedings. Proletarian elements should be sent into the offices.  
 

Undoubtedly, until the floating season is over, we shall not emerge
from the fuel crisis. We must make the best possible use of sleighing and
floating. The fuel crisis has affected the textile mills, too, and they are
unable to fulfil even a minimum programme. 

There are the difficulties arising from banditism and interrupted
communication with Siberia.

Smirnov’s[3] report says they are coping with banditism out there but
cannot promise an improvement in grain deliveries. Therefore, we should not
disperse our attention in talk about the general situation, but concentrate
our efforts on finding a way out of this situation. 

A word or two about the situation in the Moscow organisation. Some
comrades try to shift the blame for the squabbling on the majority of the
Moscow Committee. If the minority are dissatisfied they can appeal against
the conference decision to the Central Committee. I



dont’t know how the
C.C. will decide the question, but my own opinion is that the minority is
to blame. The resolution of the All-Russia Conference says that the opinion
of the minority is to be reckoned with and that a discussion and debate is
necessary within the

Party.[4] At the gubernia conference in November elections to the
Moscow Committee took place on this

platform.[5] A two-room system was applied, and that is already a
rift; such a state of affairs, though, can no longer be tolerated. We
permitted criticism not for the sake of criticism, but to get a correct
decision passed. Moscow has broken the record in discussions. In November
there was talk about the Moscow Committee’s wrong line, and 120 votes were
given for it. During the discussion, when everyone put forward his own
platform, the votes against the Moscow Committee were already less. What
democracy is it, if a conference cannot elect the M.C.? After a three-month
discussion the blame for the squabbling falls on those who are
dissatisfied. Of course, there is the formal right to appeal against a
decision, but it is the duty of revolutionaries to rally more closely at
difficult moments and not abuse the formal right of appeal. 

Sixty-seven Russian newspapers abroad tell us that the S.R.s and others
count on setting us at odds in the spring at non-Party conferences. And at
such a moment people talk

    

about appealing against the decision of the conference. You have got to
understand what you can appeal for, when and to what extent. We gave
everyone a chance to have his say, we held a discussion—and the congress
will decide, but now we are at our fighting posts. We have to rally and
realise that one more step in the discussion and we are no longer a
Party. While not for a moment denying the right to appeal, I say that we
performed our duty even without the discussion and should do our duty
now. We must send Communists to all the non-Party organisations and explain
this difficult situation to them. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The meeting of Party activists was called by the Moscow Committee of
the R.C.P.(B.) at an extremely difficult period, when economic dislocation
in the country was at its worst.


The purpose of the meeting was to inform the Party activists of the
measures taken to improve the supply of Moscow’s working people. The
meeting decided to have a report on Soviet Russia’s international and
domestic situation included in the agenda of the plenary session of the
Moscow Soviet.

This refers to the counter-revolutionary revolt of the Dashnaks in
Armenia, which started on February 13, 1921. The Dashnaks received aid in
arms and money from the imperialist Govern-ments of Britain, the U.S.A.,
France, Menshevik Georgia and Turkey. They established a regime of terror
and tyranny in the areas which they had seized, burning and razing to the
ground villages and towns. The working people of Armenia under the
leadership of the Bolshevik Party and with the support of units of the 11th
Army of Soviet troops quelled the revolt, liberated the capital of Armenia,
Yerevan, on April 4, 1921 and drove out the Dashnaks.

I. N. Smirnov was the Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary
Committee.

Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) “On the Immediate Tasks of Party

The mobilisation of raw material resources was one of time main targets
of the Soviet Republic’s economic policy in connection with the plan for
rehabilitating industry. This question was discussed on February 18, 1921,
at a meeting of the C.P.C.’s Economic Commission chaired by Lenin. The
commission set up a special body which was to have dealt in detail with the
question of collecting raw materials. The notes published here were
apparently made by Lenin during a meeting of the Raw Materials Commission
on February 26, 1921. The question of raw material was further discussed at
the C.P.C. on March 1, 1921, and at a meeting of a special parity
commission of the Supreme Economic Council and the Commissariat for
Food. The draft decision concerning the collection of raw materials was
endorsed by the C.P.C. on April 7, 1921.

The Council of Labour and Defence resolves to take
immediate and urgent steps to improve the supply of the needy workers in
food and other necessaries, allocate funds for this purpose to the amount
of up to ten million gold rubles and send a delegation
abroad to purchase the necessary articles at once—the delegation to
include representatives of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade
Unions.

Confidential 

A Letter to the Baku Comrades 
(On the question of concessions)

Preliminary plan: 

1. Differences are beginning to arise on an extremely
important question. (Decision of the C.P.C. 1921, its text.) 

2. Concessions in Baku? example and crux of all differences, their “focus”. 

3-8. Counter-arguments (A 1 - a 6).

+8 b i s. 

9. Examine and refute them. 

10. Economic crux of the matter. 

11. Gigantic political mistake. 

12. Issue of principle. 

13. Suggested agreement. 

14. Conclusion. 
 

NB
[Transcriber’s Note: The following sets of text,
I through III and IV through VI are
bracketed with ‘ { ’and ‘ }’] 

a I Chief phases of chief

 II “arguments” (and chief

 III errors) of opponent 

IV opponent’s “retreat”

 V “line of trenches behind

 VI which prejudice is trying to hide” 

3. (a I) “Will not want to work for the capitalists, when
others next door are working for themselves.” 

4. (a II) “Krasin is backed by Bogdatyan.” 

Krasin: What, in point of principle,
is the gist of the disputes concerning
Krasin’s personality?

 Simply “a bourgeois specialist”! 

Specialists’ deceit

 question of the significance of
specialists and the attitude . towards them 

4 a. “Bourgeois specialist”? Out with him!  

We must learn to use the “bourgeois specialist”, learn to
demand of him, to understand where his “strength” lies.  

4 b. “Well-behaved communist musicians”, who, may be a
bit out of tune, but don’t touch a

drop.[2] 

5. (a III) “Private capitalism is a predator, only state
power (nationalisation) is capable of running things rationally.”


6. (a IV) “It isn’t proved that we shall not be able to
obtain equipment ourselves.”

( =we’ll cope ourselves).  

7. (a V) Won’t be able to control foreigners.  

8. (a VI) Our specialists say: “problematical” (what
exactly is problematical and what must we be able to demand of the
specialist).  

8 bis (a VII) Baku: catastrophe.

 I. Grozny: Variant.  

¼ of oil wells, gear, etc.—the



“rear” of advanced capitalism.  
 

10. Economic question: is advanced capitalism superior to
us now in techniques and organisation?  

10 a. Can we now set ourselves the task of coping
on our own, or is this Left-wing childishness, or stupid doctrinairism?


10 b. Should the problem necessarily be put this way: in
view of the gigantic danger of Soviet power’s breakdown as a result of
economic chaos and backwardness, the danger of falling behind, not
catching up’ the problem must be put only this way-to catch up by
means of an alliance with foreign capital?  

“If we give up 1/4 and keep up with two-quarters that is
the ideal, which we shall not attain in a year, and if we do it in
five years it will be a great victory.”  

This is a business-like, not infantile, way of putting the
question.  

11. Why does Σ mean a gigantic political error?

 Wrong evaluation of perspectives, relations of classes
both in Russia (proletariat, peasantry, bourgeoisie)
and


throughout the world. 

12. Economic significance = (a) bloc with advanced
state

capitalism against petty-bourgeois and backward element =
() bloc with one imperialist trust against another.

“Won’t be able to control?” Who? Tsarist and bourgeois officials?
We. 

Give up ¼? Training ideal. Give up ¼, catch up
with two-quarters (three-quarters unattainable ideal). Then in 30 years
(average concession term) we shall have a peaceful victory, and in 15
probably buy it back.


 Etwa: 

13. § 1. Observation of up-to-date engineering rules.

 § 2. Import of breadstuff, clothes, and other consumer goods
(for the workers of “their” enterprises).

 § 3. Import of machinery.

 § 4. All imports from abroad ( 2 and § 3) give us
one-quarter-one-third of the same product. (One “case” out of three falls
to our lot.)

 § 5. We give a minimum (timber, for example) and for special
payment.

    

 § 6. Our laws are compulsory.

 § 7. We give “him” 50-75% of oil.

 § 8. We feed up our workers and specialists in relays.

 § 9. We learn in earnest, and don’t shout about “winning an
easy victory”. 

14.  Should we try to find such concessionaires on such
conditions?  This is the only right way of putting the question. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The main part of this document (from the words “will not want to
work...” to the end) is in the form of notes made during a dis-cussion of
oil concessions, probably at a plenary meeting of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on
February 24, 1921. Lenin later rearranged the notes, numbered them (points
3-14) and used the free upper margin for a preliminary plan of his letter
(points 1-14). Lenin’s letter written according to this plan is not in the
Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC. of
the C.P.S.U. The chief questions outlined in the plan were dealt with in
Lenin’s letter to A. P. Serebrovsky, Chairman of Aznef-tekom, Baku, dated
April 2, 1921 (see Collected Works,



Vol. 52, Fifth Russian Edition, Document 219).  

Lower down the page mention is made of the decision of the C.P.C. on
oil concessions passed on February 1, 1921. The Coun- cil adopted Lenin’s
draft and approved in principle the granting of concessions on certain oil
districts of Baku and Grozny and other oilfields. For oil concessions see
also Collected Works, Vol. 42, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 334-36,
and Vol. 52., Documents 143 and 205).  



[2]
Lenin here quotes from Krylov’s fable “Musicians”. In this fable a
landowner boasts of his serf choir to his neighbour. The singers had
neither ear nor voice, but the landowner did not think this mattered, as
the thing he most appreciated in people was sobriety and good
behaviour.

 Remark On The Amendment Of Rafail (B. B. Farbman)

 To The Resolution On Party Unity March

16[4] 

I don’t think this amendment ought to be adopted. When this
discussion started we did not keep to the division in Pravda—political
articles got mixed up with discussion

    

articles. We say here in an emphasised but not ultimatum form that these
should not be dragged into the press.

March

Comrades, I am very sorry that I used the word
“machinegun” and hereby give a solemn promise never to use such words
again even figuratively, for they only scare people and afterwards you
can’t make out what they want. (Applause.) Nobody intends to shoot
at anybody with a machine-gun and we are sure that neither Comrade Kiselyov
nor anybody else will have cause to do so.

Remark On Marchenko’s Amendment To The Resolution On The Anarchist And
Syndicalist Deviation March

To say this in the name of the congress is far too
prohibitive. I move that this amendment should not be adopted, without, of
course, depriving the C.C. of the right to recommend, and in case of need,
to concentrate all this in C.C.

    

publications: but I think it would be too much to have a congress ban on
the issue of such publications locally.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)  was held in Moscow on
March 8-16, 1921. It was attended, according to the report of the Mandate
Commission, by 694 voting delegates and 296 delegates with a voice but no
vote, representing 732,521 Party members. The items on the agenda were: 1)
Report of the Central Committee; 2) Report of the Control Commission; 3)
The trade unions and their role in the country’s economic life; 4) The
Socialist Republic in a capitalist encirclement, foreign trade,
conces-sions, etc.; 5) Food supply, the surplus-appropriation system, the
tax in kind and the fuel crisis; 6) Questions of Party organisation; 7) The
Party’s current tasks in the national question; 8) Reorganisation of the
army and the militia question; 9) The Chief Committee for Political
Education and the Party’s pro- paganda and agitation work; 10) Report of
the R . C.P.’s representative in the Comintern and its current tasks; 11)
Report of the R.C.P.’s representative in the International Trade Union
Council; 12) Elections to the Central Committee, the Control Commission and
the Auditing Commission.


The congress passed decisions on cardinal issues
pertaining to the country’s political and economic life. The work of the
congress was guided by Lenin, who delivered the opening and closing
speeches and made reports on the political activities of the C.C., the
substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus grain appropriation system,
Party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist deviation, the trade unions, and
the fuel question.  Lenin drafted the major resolutions for the

The meeting of the supporters of the ’,Platform of Ten" referred to
here apparently took place on the eve of the congress or early in its
proceedings-on March 8 or 9, 1921.  



[3]
This point was elaborated by Lenin in Point 7 of his preliminary draft
resolution on Party unity adopted by the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)
(see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 241-44).  



[4]
The amendment of Rafail (R. B. Farbman) to Point 4 of the resolution on
Party unity proposed adding that moot points "be discussed at general
meetings and in the press". The amendment was rejected. 



[5]
A. S. Kiselyov came out against Point 7 of the resolution on Party
unity, in which the Central Committee was authorised to

resort to the extreme measure of expulsion from the Party in the case of
C.C. members guilty of factional activities. In his speech Kiselyov stated
that Lenin, in describing the significance of this point, had used the
expression “mounting machine-guns”.  



[6]
The amendment of K. I. Marchenko applied to Point 6 of the resolution
’On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in Our Party" (see present
edition, Vol. 32, p. 248). Marchenko pro-posed to include in the resolution
that discussion publications be issued only by the C.C. of the R.C.P,(B,)
or by the Regional Bureaux of the CC. The amendment was rejected.

 Rejoinder During The Debate 

We have just heard exceedingly diplomatic speeches on the
part of Comrade Shlyapnikov and Comrade Ryazanov’ who although they are now
protesting very loudly’ are nevertheless protesting so diplomatically that
they would make highly satisfactory negotiators with concessionaires and
with bourgeois states. We have come to a meeting at which I report on the
disagreements that arose in the Central Committee and the Council of
People’s Commissars. The same disagreements will emerge here during the
discussion .... These differences were resolved by the decision of the
Tenth Congress, which says: “The decree of the C.P.C. shall be approved
and a concession shall be granted in Baku and Grozny.” We want to discuss
this question here, that is why I asked that Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s
proposal should be rejected, and they should have their inquisitiveness,
not to say curiosity, gratified by the results of the ensuing debate.

 Reply To The Debate On The Report On Concessions 

Comrades, the question was raised here from the very outset
whether our differences in regard to concessions were serious or not, and
the desire was expressed, incidentally’ by Comrade Shlyapnikov that more
systematic information be given on each agreement. I’m afraid this is
impracticable, if only for technical reasons. For instance, take the case

    

of peace treaties with different countries. After the general directives,
which at first were drafted in great detail, it so fell out that a certain
type of treaty with bourgeois countries was adopted by tacit consent, the
mass of details being left to the representatives authorised to sign the
treaty. And most of these details are probably unknown to the majority of
the members of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Central
Committee. The same here: we were dealing with a question of principle and
we thought there was a danger of disagreements arising. Therefore the Party
congress had to step in, and therefore the present meeting, in which only
members of the Party are taking part, was a meeting called for the purpose
of mutual information. We have read out to you what the Council of People’s
Commissars has

adopted.[4] 

The C.P.C.’s decision was adopted in spite of the motion by two very
prominent trade unionists. What other method of information do the majority
of the communist group members have if not through such a meeting as this
one? It works out that there were less disagreements than we thought. This
is the most desirable thing for us. No minutes of this meeting are being
kept and we do not intend to have a press discussion on it. Our purpose has
been achieved. 

In informing you of the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars,
we are letting you know how we have accepted the decision of. the Party
congress. The remaining differences of opinion do not exceed those which
arise from day to day on various questions and are decided by a simple
vote, without becoming a hindrance to the work. Submission to the majority
in that case is not only a matter of form, but an act that does not hinder
further work. I think we have achieved here a result in that no serious
differences have come to light, and partial differences will be ’ironed out
in the course of the work itself. 

Comrade Ryazanov, characteristically, has tried to drag in
disagreements with the Workers’ Opposition. He specially chose a
formulation that was intended to be a teaser, but he failed in this, and
none of the speakers fell for it. 

One comrade sent in a note saying that we here are concluding a second
Treaty of Brest. The first one had turned out well, as to the second one,
he has his doubts. This true, but the present agreement, in the field of
economy

    

is something between the Brest Treaty and an agreement with any bourgeois
state. We have already signed several such agreements, including a trade
agreement with Britain. The one on concessions will be something between
the Brest Treaty and such agreements with bourgeois states. 

Comrade Ryazanov then passed a remark, quite correctly, which I should
like to underline at the very outset. He said that if we want to grant a
concession it was not meant to improve the position of the workers, but to
raise the productive forces. Quite right! As to improving the position of
the workers’ we always stand by this. I have here a draft agreement with a
Swedish corporation of ball-bearing plants written by the staff of the
Supreme Economic

Council[5] (reads). 

This agreement does not stipulate any improvement in the condition of
the workers. True’ it is so worded that the Russian Government undertakes
to supply the workers with everything they need, and if it fails to do
this, the capitalists have the right to bring in workers from abroad. As to
the ability of the Russian Government to fulfil everything the plan calls
for as far as the workers are concerned, I think that neither we, nor the
Supreme Economic Council, nor the Swedes can have any illusions on this
score. At any rate, in this Comrade Ryazanov is quite right’ for the main
thing in concessions is not improvement of the workers’ condition, but the
raising of the productive forces and such a transaction under which we are
making great sacrifices in order to increase output. But what are these
sacrifices? I have been told that I gloss over these sacrifices, play them
down. Comrade Ryazanov even tried to crack a joke on this score. I did not
play down the sacrifices, I only said that we may have to give the
capitalists not only hundreds, but thousands of per cent in profits. That’s
the whole gist of it! 

If, as I assumed, on the basis of calculations by our specialists, we
take 30-40 per cent of the oil, for instance, for ourselves, if the
capitalist, out of every 100 million ponds of oil which he produces, takes
50-60 million ponds for himself, and possessing the transport, sells them
at a profit of perhaps 1000 per cent, or maybe more, then the position is
clear. And when I tried to find out from Krasin the terms of his agreement
on the basis of his preliminary talks with

    

the businessmen and tycoons, I asked: “Can one conceive of a type of
agreement under which we stipulate a definite percentage of profit for the
capitalist, say up to 80 per cent.”  He said: “It is not a question of
the size of the profits, because these robbers now make as much as 1000 per
cent, not 80.” 

To my mind’ the sacrifices will be very heavy. We shall probably have
to make great sacrifices if we are going to give concessions on ores or
timber’ if we are going to give away raw materials which they are so
desperately in need of abroad, such as manganese ore’ for example. Georgia
has now become Soviet. The thing is to unite the Caucasian Republics into a
single economic centre: the Georgian, Azerbaijan and Armenian
Republics. Azerbaijan produces oil; it has to be transported via Batum
through Georgian territory, so there will be a single economic centre. 

According to one report, the Georgian Menshevik government had
concluded a concession agreement, which, on the whole’ is acceptable to
us. Preliminarily, I could only get in touch with Georgian comrades and
ascertain from a talk with Comrade Yenukidze, the Secretary of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee, who is himself a Georgian, that he
had been there and concluded an agreement—true, not a concession
agreement—with the Menshevik Georgian government granting us without
resistance one-sixth of Georgia while retaining a guarantee of

inviolability.[6] 

After this agreement, to the signing of which Comrade Yenukidze was a
party, they preferred nevertheless, despite the guarantee of inviolability’
to quit Batum for Constantinople, so that we have gained by this in two
ways, positively and negatively—in that we have acquired territory, not
for Russia’ but for Soviet Georgia—Batum and its environs—and in that we
have lost a good many Mensheviks, who have left for Constantinople. 

It appears that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee is inclined to
confirm the concession on unworked coal-mines, which it considers a very
important one. Two representatives of foreign powers were in Georgia and
did not leave at the time of the Soviet coup—the Italian and the
German—most important circumstance, as it is desirable to develop
relations with these countries, by means, among others, of
concessions. Italy even had a concession agreement with

    

Georgia, while in Germany the situation is that some German capitalists own
a tremendous per cent of the Chiatura manganese mines. The thing is to
transfer the right of ownership to a lease or a concession, that is, to
grant on lease to the German capitalists the very mines which they owned as
property. Owing to the change in the political situation in the Caucasus,
the circumstances are favourable for concession relations. The important
thing for us is to force windows open one after another. The agreement with

Britain[7] was that of a Socialist Republic with a bourgeois state, an
agreement that imposed upon us a certain burden. 

To the first state with whom we concluded an agreement we gave a much
greater part of our gold fund than we have given to others. But the
consequences have shown that thanks to this agreement we have forced open a
window of sorts. It is from this point of view that we should judge every
concession. 

Germany and Italy, owing to their economic position, are obliged to
seek an alliance with Russia. For Russia,,an alliance with Germany opens up
vast economic prospects, irrespective of whether or not the German
revolution will soon win a victory there. We can come to terms even with a
bourgeois government in Germany, because the Versailles Treaty has made
Germany’s position impossible, whereas an alliance with Russia opens up
entirely different possibilities. Since Italy has no fuel resources of her
own, they have taken a coal-mining concession in the Caucasus at
coal-fields that have never been worked before. I should not be surprised
to see the Germans hankering after oil concessions, as Germany has no fuel
at all. 

One of the comrades here said that the Kamchatka concession would not
improve the condition of the workers. That is absolutely wrong. And Comrade
Ryazanov was quite wrong when he tried to crack a joke about our dealings
with Vanderlip turning out to be a Vander-slip. True, we made one
mistake—our telegram to Harding. But since we have had no agreements or
relations with ’America till now’ there was no mistake on our part, and we
only found out that Vanderlip had been boasting of his connections with
the American Administration. Now it is quite possible that in sending our
representatives to Canada, where we are to buy

    

locomotives, that through this side door we may gain, some access to the
American market. 

Negotiations for Kamchatka concessions are beginning to stir now, and
it is quite wrong to say that these concessions will not improve the
condition of the workers. If these concessions materialise, there will be
an undoubted improvement in the condition of the workers, because we shall
be receiving a certain deduction share, 2 per cent I believe, and when we
have nothing at all, even 2 per cent is something. If we get 20,000 out of
one million and use it for an exchange with the peasants, this will give us
some of the products the workers need. 

Further I wanted to point out that some of the remarks you have made
here show that there are disagreements among the trade unionists, or rather
perplexities, which are the only real danger and which we’ among
ourselves’ perhaps by further discussions among the Party members, have to
eliminate. For example, Comrade Marshev spoke about payment having to be
made in cash, and not by coupons. As to the

Amsterdamists[8] and whether they will attack us, we must come to an
arrangement about this. 
I recently re-read my pamphlet written in May

1918.[1]

I quoted in it the Menshevik newspaper

Vperyod[9] which the Menshevik Isuv accused the Soviet
government of agreeing to concessions’ of having deals with bourgeois
states. It is an old trick of the Mensheviks to blame us for granting
concessions. Quite a few groups have already taken shape in this connection
in Western Europe. The Communists understand that concessions are a treaty
of Brest, which we are obliged to put up with because of the ruined state
of a country with a predominantly peasant population. Everyone understands
that regeneration of the country without a big industry is
unthinkable. 
The Communists of Germany understand why we have to give ground, but
the Scheidemanns and the II/2 International say that these concessions are
proof of our complete failure, and I remember at a meeting last year I
mentioned the American chauvinist

       Spargo,[2]

who specialised in

    

writing a heap of books about the Bolsheviks in the vein of our Alexinsky,
and in connection with the concessions he all but performed a dance of
triumph. I mentioned at the time that this was an utter
distortion. Yesterday international capital was out to strangle us, and
today we have a number of agreements with this international capital. 

We are making sacrifices in giving away to foreign capital millions’
worth of valuable materials from which they can make profits running into
hundreds of per cent. These are sacrifices which we are making deliberately
and consciously. But at the same time we should note that while allowing
them to make any profit they like, we are receiving the advantages we need
ourselves, i.e., increased output, and as far as possible an improvement in
the condition of our workers, both those employed at the concession
enterprises and those not so employed. 

Comrade Shlyapnikov said here that it would be a good .thing to grant a
concession to Russian workers. The idea is absurd. We would then have to
guarantee fuel, etc., a thing which we can’t guarantee even to our most
essential enterprises. We are bad off for fuel. The idea of a concession
agreement with Russian workers’ generally speaking, is permissible in
principle, but such a solution of the problem for our big industry is not
serious, since we cannot guarantee them anything, whereas foreign
concessionaires can bring in supplies from abroad. That is what
distinguishes the agreement with foreign capitalists. They have the world
market, we have no secure economic base and would have to spend ten years
creating it. This is what we must soberly take into account. All our people
engaged in this problem have proved this situation. 

We know that the electrification plan is the most economical one. We
cannot lease our big factories to the Russian workers. We must stake here
on small industry’ develop it and not rail at our tax-in-kind measures the
way Comrade Ryazanov does, or the author of that pamphlet which says that
we are putting through anarcho-syndicalist laws. 

As regards the development of small industry, we must take several
steps, as we can get something out of it right now without state
guarantees, and since we cannot guarantee

    

even our most essential factories, we must do everything we can to develop
small industry, which will give us a certain amount of produce which the
peasants need. 

On the question of cash or coupons I would say this: it would be
something to fear if the capitalists had the power, but we have nothing to
fear, since all the factories and enterprises are in our hands, and we
haven’t leased a tenth part of them to the capitalists. I repeat’ we have
nothing to fear from coupons’ as the capitalists will be obliged to stock
the goods we tell them to’ not just salted fish, as was mentioned here, but
such-and-such products. Since we are taking the norm of a foreign worker,
we know that under this norm he gets even more and better products than the
Russian worker does. 

Comrade Shlyapnikov here said: “We have seen concessions.” Both
Comrade Shlyapnikov and many practical workers make this mistake. I have
heard people say: “Your idea of concessions is schematic. The capitalist
has always tricked the most experienced Russian lawyers.” To be sure he
did’ when state power was in the capitalist’s hands and he was
all-powerful. What was that state power? A committee for the affairs of the
propertied master class—that’s what it was. A committee for the affairs
of the landowners and capitalists—that was what the capitalist government
was. But if we, having in our hands most of the factories, mills and
railways, with our Party standing at the head—with communist cells below
and Communists on top—if we do not hold our own in such conditions, then
we might as well commit suicide. And that is panic! 

We are not that bad though 1 think, to allow ourselves to be tricked,
and if we have already concluded several agreements in which the
governments in France and Britain had the services of first-class bourgeois
diplomats, and if even under these conditions we have not once been
tricked, then why should we panic at the idea of being tricked by coupons?
Let me remind you of the treaty of Brest. In what way was this treaty
difficult? What were the difficulties of defence? When I was asked whether
I had any hopes of our being able to fool the Germans, I was obliged, in my
official capacity, to say that I did not. But now the treaty of Brest is
past history. 
 

I don’t know whether the pamphlet Comrade Kamenev was preparing has
come out (it deals there with Ludendorf), but I do know that Ludendorf has
written a brilliant volume of memoirs in which ten pages are devoted to the
Brest negotiations. When Kamenev and I read that chapter we said: “This is
the best justification of the Brest Treaty.” He tells how Trotsky and the
others had driven them into a corner during the talks, how they were
outwitted, and so on. We decided there and then that these pages had to be
translated and published with a short preface by Comrade Kamenev, and the
fact that this hasn’t been done yet is a specimen of Soviet ineptitude. Or
take a fact like this. We know that Comrade Joffe, our Ambassador to the
German Government, was expelled from Germany on the eve of the revolution
there. After this, don’t try to guess who is going to trick whom. Don’t let
us lay down how many days will pass between the conclusion of the first
concession agreement and the first big European revolution. That is why’ on
the question of agreements, I maintain that the comrades are absolutely
wrong. There’s nothing to worry about. 

The agreements will say what goods they are to have and at what
price. We can agree to any coupons or ration books. If they break the
agreement we have the right to cancel it immediately. The agreement is a
civil contract. I haven’t gone into the question of what arbitration there
is to be and who is to settle disputes, but I shall run through the initial
draft of the agreement with the Swedish corporation. It says here:
“Differences are settled....” 

People here have brought academicians into play, and these will try to
bring the lawyers into play. I remember Bebel saying that lawyers were the
most reactionary and at the same time bourgeois’ people. Of course’ we can
mend this somehow’ but there is nothing at all to worry about. If the
concessionaires were to lay down this condition we could accept it. Once
the agreement stipulates precisely that there are to be such-and-such goods
and payment on the ration book is to be made in such-and-such a way, we can
agree to this, and the Socialist Republic has nothing to fear from coupons
or ration books. It was further stated that Point 9 was bad because we
would be drawing away from the international

T.U.C.[10] Lozovsky threatened that the

    

Amsterdam people would slam us, but they will slam us all the same on all
other points, and end up’ as always, with slamming themselves. 

You remember how the Mensheviks intended slamming us for having made
the slightest concessions to the capitalists. When we wanted to overthrow
capitalism’ they said we would overthrow it only for a few days’ but when
we have overthrown it for a few years, they are trying to set another trap
for us. They are trying to lure the enemy into a spot where he is sure to
be beaten. 

First they called us utopians, then invited us to jump from the fifth
floor. We know that we have many small businesses. Petty proprietors are
our opponents. The petty-bourgeois element is our most dangerous
enemy. Brokers and leaseholders are the lesser enemy. Bureaucracy’ too, and
bureaucratic abuses are our enemy. 

In regard to the point Comrade Lozovsky spoke about’ I will say
this—listen to it carefully. It says: “The trade unions shall not have
the right to demand application of Russian pay rates or of Russian rules of
employment to that category of workers.” It speaks here of the Russian
trade unions, and I am told about the international unions. Naturally, when
the capitalists see the Russian terms’ they say they are communist terms,
ridiculous terms, and that the Russian trade unions have no right to demand
Russian terms of employment, which are likely to be pretty stiff and
far-fetched’ but they do have a full right to apply international trade
union agreements. This is good enough. Nothing is mentioned here about
strikes’ about their being banned. The thing is to be able not to mention
everything before its time. 

As to improving the condition of the Russian worker, Comrade Marshev
and Tartakovsky have made an attack here, saying you won’t be able to cope
with the workers’ you won’t be able to make them work, because if you
provide for one-fifth of them, the other four-fifths won’t want to work
under worse conditions. Do you mean to say we are dealing with workers who
are so foolish, uncultivated and undisciplined? If so, then the only thing
is to panic and commit suicide. If a hundred workers are underfed and we
tell them that we can feed twenty, and no more, do you mean to say they

    

will refuse it? So far we have not come up against anything like it. We
have managed somehow to feed workers in certain branches of industry, but
not all of them, yet the workers didn’t all run away from these
enterprises, whereas they all did from other enterprises. Can the Russian
worker be so spoilt by the mistakes of Soviet power that he cannot figure
out that it were better to feed at least 20 people than to make the whole
hundred go hungry? There is a good deal here that ought not to be spoken
about before its time. Why can’t it be arranged for people to take turns in
working for the capitalists? The workers would work six months, get working
clothes, then give others a chance to feed up. Of course’ we shall have to
break down prejudices here. 

When concessionaires come here, we must restrain our trade unions from
making excessive demands. You know that the usual term of an agreement is a
short one. In Europe there are no long-term agreements. The usual term is
six months. In this way the workers will be able to feed up, get boots and
clothes, then quit and make way for others. 

Is it so impossible to arrange things so that a man works six months,
feeds up’ gets American boots and clothes, and makes room for the next man?
It will be difficult, of course. It will demand a higher degree of
organisation and discipline than we have’ but it is not impossible. If we
have contrived to keep a hold on the workers



agai st an invasion of foreign
capital during three years of terrible famine, do you mean to say we won’t
manage it this time? I realise only too well what difficulties confront us
here. And therefore I say that concessions do not signify the advent of
peace among the classes. Concessions are a continuation of the war among
the classes. 

If previously the war could be expressed in—111 get you through
starvation and you’ll get nothing’ now I say that I want to give the
workers a pair of boots each, but I want them to work six months. And we’ll
fight for all the workers getting boots. We do not reject strikes, all this
remains in our hands, if only we are reasonable and try to put the accent
now on what we can do to attract the capitalists. 

People here have talked about what a great danger this is, saying that
the capitalist will come and trick us, but I assert that there is no
danger, and that in the interests of raising

    

productivity it is desirable that he should come, because he has a
splendidly organised base and splendidly equipped factories’ where we can
order the necessary parts without having to buy them on the open market’
where there is only junk. The first-class factories have their orders
booked up for several years ahead. Even if we paid in gold we would not
receive anything’ whereas a member of the syndicate would get everything he
wanted. We wouldn’t mind paying him extra if it meant improving the
condition of at least a small section of the workers and peasants, because
each extra product will go to the peasants in exchange for grain’ and that
will create stable relations between the working class and the
peasantry. 

Winding up, I would ask the trade unionists to waive questions of
principle and disputes. All these are idle disputes’ sheer
scholasticism. They should be dropped. Attention should be wholly directed
to those practical terms of concession agreements from which we, if we are
sensible, may derive benefit for ourselves. The trade unionists and Party
leaders should display here their inventiveness and practical knowledge of
conditions, of which we cannot and shall not speak about in the press,
because the Russian press is being followed by the capitalists, just as
during the Brest talks we did not speak about the instructions that had
been given to Comrade Joffe. We shall give practical attention to the
practical methods by which we can derive benefit in the way of improving
the condition of the workers and peasants. Every such improvement is of
tremendous importance to us. This is where the trade unionists should give
their attention. All trace of friction and prejudice should be
eliminated. It is a difficult business. So far no one has been willing to
conclude a concession agreement with us. They are all expecting us to
present impracticable demands. 

We, therefore, on our part must use every effort to conclude several
such agreements. Of course, we shall make a number of mistakes. It is a new
business. So far no socialist republic has ever granted concessions to
capitalists. But we want the trade unionists to help us. There is vast
scope here for interpretations and pressure, including strikes, which
remain in our hands.

[3]
The meeting of the Communist group of the A.C.C.T.U. discussed the
question of concessions and the condition of the workers at the concession
enterprises. The meeting was called because some trade union functionaries
vacillated on this subject, while A. G. Shlyapnikov and D. B, Ryazanov
carried on demagogic propaganda against the idea of concessions.


Lenin made a report on this issue (see present edition, Vol. 32,
pp. 300-15), argued against Shiyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s statements in the
debate, and made notes of the debate, which he used in his reply to the
debate.  




[4]
This refers to the decision on “The Basic Principles of Concessions
Agreements” passed by the C.P.C. on March 29, 1.921, on the basis of
Lenin’s draft. This decision was read out by Lenin in his report on
concessions made at a meeting of the Communist group of the A.C.C.T.U. (see
present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 302-13). In saying that the C.P.C. passed its
decision "in spite of the motion by two very prominent trade unionists",
Lenin apparently had in view M. P. ’l’omsky and A. Z. Holtzmann. 



[5]
Lenin is referring to the draft of a concession agreement with the AB
Svenska Kullager Fabriken in Goteborg (AB SKF). The agreement was signed in
April 1923. 



[6]
This refers to the agreement signed at Kutaisi between the Georgian
Revolutionary Committee and representatives of the Georgian Menshevik
Government following negotiations held on March 17 and 18, 1921.  



[7]
Lenin is referring to the trade agreement between Soviet Russia and
Britain signed on March 16, 1921. 



[8]
This refers to the leaders of the Amsterdam International of Trade
Unions-the centre of the international association of reformist trade
unions (founded at the congress in Amsterdam called in July 1919; existed
up to December 1945). 



[9]
Vperyod  (Forward)-a Menshevik daily, launched in March 1917
in Moscow as the organ of the Moscow organiation of the Mensheviks, and
subsequently as the organ of the R.S.D.L.P.  (Menshevik) committees of the
Moscow organisation and the Central Region. On April 2, 1918, it became the
organ also of the Mensheviks’ Central Committee. On May 10, 1918, by an
order of the Vecheka the newspaper was closed down owing to its
counter-revolutionary activities, and the men in charge were
prosecuted. The newspaper resumed publication on May 14 under the name
Vsegda Vperyod!  (Ever’Forward!) The paper was closed down for
good in February 1919 by decision of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee. 



[10]
Lenin is referring to the International Council of Trade Unions
organised in July 1920 on the initiative of the Executive Committee of the
Communist International and the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions
to serve as the centre of the world revolutionary trade union movement. At
the first international congress of trade unions held in July 1921 it was
renamed the Red International of Trade Unions (the Profintern).

both the applications for orders to the amount of 38.9 million gold rubles
and the remaining applications for foreign trade orders to allow only for
such purchases in 1921-22 as are necessary for purveyance of essential

Algemba-Russian abbreviated name of the Alexanclrov-Gai-Emba branch
line and oil pipeline construction project, which was to connect the Eniba
oilfields with the Urals and Saratov. This draft decision was endorsed by
the C.L.D. on April 15, 1921. On April 29 the C.L.D. passed a decision
suspending construction of the pipeline in view of the fact that its
remoteness entailed heavy expenditure on, the delivery, of materials,
machinery and food, and on May 6 decided to switch the Alexandrov-Gai-Emba
railway construction from accelerated to ordinary tempo.

receipt by the state of farm produce in exchange for such machines and
implements. 

The forms of control are to be laid down in special instructions by

A circular to the gubernia committees to be drawn up and
forwarded in cipher. 

Contents: 

the experience of non-Party conferences has fully proved
that they have become an arena for

      agitation[1]

by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; 

therefore, the greatest care must be taken in organising non-Party
conferences, by no means allowing them to be held without thorough
preparation at each respective factory. The Gubernia Party Committees
should be answerable to the Party for the success of every non-Party
conference. 

Every Gubernia Party Committee is obliged to report to the Central
Committee not only on the success of every non-Party conference, but prior
to every non-Party

    

conference, setting forth its conditions and preparedness. 

At the same time it is absolutely essential to step up the work of
preserving and developing the Communists’ ties with the non-Party
masses. For this purpose it is necessary: 

not only to regularly hold general meetings for the rank-and-file
workers and peasants, but arrange business reports to the rank-and-file
workers and peasants by officials holding key posts. Such reports must be
delivered at least once a month in order that the non-Party rank-and-file
be given an opportunity to criticise the Soviet institutions and their
work. Reports are to be made not only by Communists, but by all officials
in top posts, first and foremost those of the food supply and economic
council agencies. 

Every gubernia committee is obliged to forward exact information
monthly to the Central Committee about the number and progress of all these
reports, as well as the demands made by the non-Party people at these
meetings. 

The C.C. will draw up more detailed instructions on the organisation of
such reports, on the measures for checking ties with the masses’ on the
progress of the work for improving their condition, and on fighting the
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are acting under the guise of
non-Party people,

etc.[3] 
 

Notes
 

[1]
The word “organisation” is written above the word “agitation” in
the manuscript.—Ed. 
 



[2]
This document formed the basis of the draft letter of the C.C.,
R.C.P.(B.) dated May 1 “On the Attitude to NonParty Workers” to whitch
Lenin made a numner ot amendments and wrote an addendum (see Collected
Works,  Vol. 43, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 390-92). On May 4 the
CC. endorsed the draft letter with Lenin’s amendments and addendum, and on
May 7 it was published in Pravda No.  97 as a circular to all
Gubernia and Uyezd Party Committees, communist groups and trade
unions. 



[3]
Lenin added in pencil at the end of the manuscript: &8220;(pamphlet on
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. On therights...) .”  The
last word is illegible Apparently Lenin meant the rights of general
meetings.

Comrade Lenin said in his report: You, as members of the
Party, should read my pamphlet concerning the tax in

kind,[1]

which has now come off the press and is being

    

distributed. He also pointed out that every member of the Party should not
lose touch with the non-Party masses, as often happens with us. Each one of
us, therefore, must keep closer to the non-Party masses and carry on more
propaganda. In conclusion he said: All of you, who often read the
newspapers and attend meetings and lectures, being more developed people,
should do more work among the peasants, carry on agitation among them to
explain the significance of the tax in kind. We shall then achieve better
results.

The C.C. of the R.C.P., having discussed Svanidze’s
telegram to Stalin No. 2031 dated 8/V, finds that the Georgian comrades are
making a serious political mistake in not using an iron hand to put a stop
to requisitions, confiscations, thefts and evictions of foreigners from
their houses. 

The C.C. resolves: 

1) that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee be directed to issue
immediately an order strictly prohibiting all such acts on pain of arrest
and prosecution. A copy of this order to be sent to the C.C. 

2) that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee immediately institute
investigations’ first, into the breaking open of the Germano-Caucasian
Bank’s store-room and the removal of documents. The guilty parties to be
arrested. Documents to be returned. Secondly, ditto in regard to the goods
of the Italo-Caucasian Bank. Thirdly, ditto in regard to the carload of
textiles seized at Kutaisi. 

3) that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee, by arrangement with the
Command of the Caucasian Front, shall without delay appoint two of the most
energetic, firm and resourceful Communists, one from the Caucasian Front,
and one from the Georgian Revolutionary Committee, to supervise the
cessation of requisitions, thefts, confiscations and evictions in regard
to foreigners. The names of the

    

appointed men to be communicated to us by telegraph. The C.C. places
responsibility for the enforcement of these measures upon Makharadze and
Gittis. The two controllers to be invested with special powers and the
right to make arrests for the slightest infringements. The two controllers
to wire brief reports here weekly. 

The C.C. draws the attention of the Georgian comrades to the extremely
important significance of Georgia and her trade with Italy and Germany for
the whole R.S.F.S.R., especially in view of America’s and France’s attempts
to obstruct all our trade relations with foreign countries. Negligence in
carrying out these directives will be regarded by the C.C. as a crime
against Soviet power.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The meeting of the Communist group of the Fourth All-Russia Congress of
Trade Unions to discuss the activities of the A.C.C.T.U. was held on May
18, 1921. The congress Steering Commission set up by the C.C. of the
R,C.P.(B.) drafted a reso-lution on the activities of the A.C.C.T.U. which
was to be used as a basis for the resolution of the T.U. Congress, and
directed commission member M. P. Tomsky, Chairman of the A.C.C.T.U., to put
this draft down for discussion by the Communist group. Tomsky, however, did
not do this. The group’s, meeting adopted a resolution tabled by
D. B. Ryazanov, which ran counter to the Party decisions concerning the
relations between the Party and the trade unions. The plenum of the C.C.,
R.C.P.(B.) on May 18 condemned Byazanov’s resolution, decided to remove
Tomsky from the commission and relieve him of his post in the A.C.C.T.U.,
and to remove Ryazanov from trade union work.  

On behalf of the Central Committee Lenin took the floor at a group
meeting and revealed the anarcho-syndicalist nature of Ryazariov’s
motion. The group, by an overwhelming majority, rejected Ryazanov’s
resolution and adopted that of the Central Committee. There is no record of
Lenin’s speech in the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U. 



[2]
During the years of industrial breakdown and disorganisation following
the First World War and the civil war some of the industrial workers became
declassed. It was said of such people that they did not do their jobs at
the factories, but made "cigarette ligliters" there, that is, they took
advantage of the slackening of labour discipline to make articles of
domestic use for the black market.

Yaroslavsky and Bukharin to be instructed to revise the
draft so as not to over-emphasise the question of combating religion (by
throwing out § 7, for

instance[2]) and to allow,

    

under definite restrictive conditions, for religious, but honest and
devoted Communists, to remain in the Party. 

The fight against religion to be put on a more scientific footing. 


(§ 10-out.[3]) 

Get it endorsed by the Politbureau. 

Start the campaign after thorough preparation. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This document was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion on
May 18, 1921, by the CC. plenum of the question of implementing Clause 13
of the Party Programme dealing with measures in the sphere of religious
relations. Lenin’s motion was adopted by the plenum. 



[2]
Point 7 of the plenum’s original draft resolution, required that the
question of the Party’s attitude to religion “be put before all Party
cells and committees. The Agitation and Propaganda Department shall draft
and send out preliminary theses of a report. The minutes of meetings arid
generally all material dealing with this question nra to be collected
locally, forwarded to the Central Committee, and worked up for a report to
the Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.” (Central Party Archives, Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.). 



[3]
Point 10 of the original draft resolution spoke of the necessity of the
Party conducting a most decisive struggle against attempts on the part of
“some of the clergy to set up anew church organisation” accommodated to
the state organisation. During the 1930s, sections of the Orthodox Church
were co-opted into the State as a way of legitimizing actions of the
government during the collectivization of agriculture and the purge trials
that took place against the old leadership of the Communist Party.

1. Gubernia and uyezd economic conferences are to be
organised everywhere, standing in the same relation to the gubernia and
uyezd executive committees as the Council of Labour and Defence to the
Council of People’s Commissars. Managing offices or secretariats must be
common ones. All the work is to be done through the apparatus of the
corresponding departments without creating a special apparatus. 

2. The village committees and village Soviets are to act as
the local, lower bodies of the C.L.D., and in factory and urban communities
these functions are to be assumed by the district Soviets, the district
economic conferences and the factory committees. The volost executive
committees either completely fulfil the duties of volost economic
conference or assign several of their members to form the volost economic
conferences. 

3. It is the obligatory duty of all the economic
conferences to report on their activities to the C.L.D., such activities to
be guided by the Instructions of the C.L.D. which are to be issued
simultaneously with this decision. 

The reports of the regional economic conferences, the gubernia and
uyezd economic conferences must be printed in

    

no less than 100 copies (three of which are to be sent to the C.L.D., one
copy each to the leading public libraries, the Rumyantsev Library in Moscow
and the Public Library in Petrograd, and one copy to the library of each
gubernia, economic conference). Reports are to be submitted every two
months (three or four months?). 

The reports of the lower bodies are to be in writing, one copy for the
gubernia economic conference and one for the C,L.D.; to be submitted not
less than twice a year. 

The report to the C.L.D. must be accompanied by systematically selected
issues of the local newspapers or cuttings from them devoted to questions
of local economic life, as well as all publications on these
questions. 

The co-operation of the local staff of the Central Statistical Board
and the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection should be enlisted, in compiling
these reports. 

Each local body is obliged immediately to appoint and communicate to
the C.L.D. the names of persons responsible for the timely drawing up of
the report in each of its subsections and general collation, as well as the
names of their deputies. 

4. The newspaper Ekonomicheskaya

Zhizn[1] is to become the organ of the C.L.D. 

Following the same Instructions, it should regularly publish summaries
of local economic work alongside its present coverage. The recording and
study of practical experience in all economic work in the R.S.F.S.R. and
the working out of general guidelines on the basis of such experience must
become the chief task of Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn. 

The editors must select and widen the circle of local correspondents,
both Party and non-Party, for the purpose of information on the work done
in the local areas. 

It shall be the duty of the Central Distributing Agency to accurately
deliver two copies of Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn to every gubernia,
uyezd and volost library, and the duty of these libraries to keep newspaper
files of both copies available for the whole population. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn (Economic Lifs)—a daily newspaper,
started coming out in November 1918 as the organ of the Supreme Economic
Council and the economic commissariats. It continued publication till
November 1937, latterly as the organ of the Commissariat for Finance of the
U.S.S.R., the State Bank and other financial organisations of the
U.S.S.R. and the Central Committee of the Bank Employees’ Trade Union.

Decision of the C.C. (Politbureau) 22/V. 1921 on the
Decisions of the R.C.P. Group of the Trade Union Congress

The Central Committee approves Comrade Chubar’s theses
(adopted by the group’s bureau) and rejects Comrade Holtzmann’s theses in
view of the fact that the former far more correctly take into consideration
the actual state of our resources, capabilities and means, which entail the
necessity of planning slower realisation of our immediate aims. 

The latter theses, those of Comrade Holtzmann, on the other hand, verge
on the fantastic in many ways, they are out of touch with reality, which is
also one of the failings of Comrade Larin, who zealously supports these
theses. 

The only important similarity between the two theses, practically
speaking, is the idea expressed in the note to Point 3 of Chubar’s

theses[1]

and in

       Point 6[2]

of Holtzmann’s theses, both comrades confirming here, and not disputing,
the decision passed by the C.C. on 10.V.1921 in connection with the motion
of Comrade Larin and the

     A.C.C.T.U.[3]

 

The R.C.P. group of the Trade Union Congress, despite the
recommendations of the Party’s C.C., approved Holtzmann’s theses by


5 6 7

votes, and rejected Chubar’s theses, which collected


3 1 7 votes. 

Not wishing to revoke the decision of the group on an issue that does
not immediately affect the Government’s policy-since this policy is
predetermined by the decision of the C.C. of 10.V.1921, which, as pointed
out above, is approved, and not disputed, by both Comrade Holtzmann and
Comrade Chubar—the Central Committee in this particular case waives its
right of interference in the proceedings and decision of the congress. 

The C.C. confines itself to prescribing that this decision he announced
at the group meeting and that the attention of the delegates be strongly
drawn to the obligation they are taking upon themselves in adopting
Holtzmann’s resolution, namely, to display not only extraordinary heroism,
but a degree of persistence, firmness and pertinacity in the fight against
all habits, customs and conditions of life among the working-class masses
far in excess of what is customary even in revolutionary times. It is now
incumbent on the trade unions, on the strength of the decision they have
made, to achieve an unusually rapid reduction in the number of enterprises
and workers by concentrating the latter in a minimum of the best and
biggest enterprises. 
 

Notes
 

[1]
Here is the text of this note:

“The whole above-mentioned system of distribution should be effected by
way of experiment at several enterprises, where, in place of individual
rationing issues’ a system of collective supply should be introduced for
the personnel of the enterprises on condition that they raise labour
productivity.” —Lenin

[2]
Here is the text of this 6th Point:

“Pending the formation of a wages food fund, the afore-mentioned system of
distribution should be applied by way of experiment at several enterprises,
where, in place of individual rationing issues a system of collective
supply should be introduced for the workers of the enterprises’ on
condition that they raise labour productivity.” —Lenin

[3]
Here is the text of this

decision.[5]

“The motion of Comrade Larin and the A.C.C.T.U. in the part relating to
tariff policy shall be rejected and its authors asked to go into the matter
more thoroughly with an eye, especially, to the possibility of ensuring a
minimum of real food supply to a minimum of workers. Upon revision, the
motion is to be submitted to the C.P.C. or the purpose of introducing at
several enterprises, by way of experiment and in place of individual
rationing issues, a system of collective supply on condition that labour
productivity is raised.” —Lenin
 



[4]
The draft resolution for the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on the question of the
decisions of the R.C.P. group at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions was
written by Lenin in connection with the group’s adoption of
A. Z. Holtzmann’s theses on the question of wage rates, which ran counter
to the C.C.’s directives. This draft was adopted by the Politburecu on May
22, 1921. The congress group, on the motion of delegations from a number of
industrial trade -unions (the metalworkers, textile workers and miners) as
well as delegations from the leading proletarian centres (Moscow, Petrograd
and lvanovo-Voznesensk), revised its decision and by a majority vote
adopte’d as a basis the theses of V. Y. Chubar, which were approved by the
C.C. The theses adopted by the group were approved by the Fourth Trade
Union Congress on May 24. 



[5]
The draft decision for the CC, was written by Lenin (see Lenin
Miscellany XXIII, p. 142).

It should be made the chief task of the All-Russia

Conference[2] in May to prepare and collect material on the question
of 


1) closer contact between the Party organisations and the non-Party
masses. 
 

2) drawing non-Party employees into the work more widely and
systematically. 

3) reorganising the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection for combating
bureaucratism and red tape, improving the condition of the workers and
peasants and drawing non-Party people into Soviet work. 

On all these points the conference should not only collect and study
all the material of practical experience, but work out practical proposals
for the C.C.


Reports at the plenary meeting: 


(α) 2-3 reports on the present (actual)


work of the C.C. and the Party 
(β) ditto on the plan of its reorganisation to meet the new
tasks. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s remarks were made to Points 6 and 7 of the Central Committee’s
work plan, drafted for the Tenth All-Russia Party Conference. On May 28,
1921, the conference approved the C.C.’a plan of work (see The
C.P.S. U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses, Conferences
and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part I, 1954,
pp. 576-77)

Lenin is referring to the All-Russia Conference of Managers of
Organising and Instructor Departments Under the Gubernia Party Committees
which was to be convened in May 1921 to discuss the immediate tasks of the
Party’s organ,satioriil work. The conference did not take place.

Lenin prepared this plan of a speech for the Fourth All-Russia Trade
Union Congress held from May 17 to 25, 1921. The Institute of
Marxism-Leninism, of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U. however, has no information
of Lenin having delivered this speech at the congress. 



[4]
Narodnayn Volya-a secret political organisation of Narodnik terrorists,
came into being in August 1879. While subscribing to views of the Narocinik
utopian socialism, its members engaged in political struggle, and
considered the most important goal to be the overthrow of the autocracy and
the winning of political freedom. They figured on achieving a
reorganisation of society without the participation of the people, by means
of individual terrorism.  “llio Narodiiaya Volya members,” wrote Lenin,
“made a step forward when they took up the political struggle but they
failed to connect it with socialism.” (see present edition, Vol. 8,
p. 72). The organisation was smashed up by the tsarist govern-ment after
the assassination of Alexander if on March 1, 1881. 



[5]
The Peace Treaty of Versailles was drawn up at the Paris Con-ference in
1919 at the end of the imperialist world war of 1914-8. between Germany and
her adversaries-the U.S.A., the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan and
other Allied powers. 

Describing this treaty in a speech on October 15,.1920,
Lenin said, “It is an unparalleled and predatory peace, which has made
slaves of tens of millions of people, including the most civilised” (see
present edition, Vol. 31, p. 326). The Versailles Peace Treaty was designed
to perpetuate the repartition of the capitalist world in favour of the
victor countries, and to establish a system of relationships between
countries aimed at strangling Soviet Russia and suppressing the
revolutionary movement throughout the world.

Comrade Mezhlauk has told me of the great success in your
work during April 1921: 294 poods per hewer compared with 291 poods in
1914. I congratulate our miner comrades on this outstanding success and
send my best greetings. At this rate we shall overcome all difficulties and
electrify the Donbas and Krivoi-Rog district, and that means
everything. 

With communist greetings,

1
Statement Concerning the Agenda
May 26

Comrades, as I have already told you, we intended to have a
single item on the agenda in keeping with the nature of this conference,
namely, the question of economic policy. The remaining reports were to be
informational, so I did not prepare a-political report, but I think this
report will have to be dealt with on an economic plane. Therefore, in order
to satisfy everybody, I suggest that supplementary questions be put to me
after the report and I shall answer them in my summing-up speech. I repeat,
I have made no preparations whatever on this question and cannot imagine
what I would speak about if I had to apart from the question of the tax in
kind. 
2
Speeches During the Debate of the Motion on Questions of
the New Economic Policy
May 28
1

I believe this

amendment[2] should not be adopted, because an explanation to the
amendment would then be needed. Naturally, if there is a revolution in
Europe we shall change our policy. Civil war, which such a revolution
always involves, as you know, may in fact render our position even
worse. Of course, this will be a short time, it is difficult, of course, to
determine how long civil war in other republics

    

will last, but when it is over and won we shall change our policy in the
sense that we may say: we shall take nothing in taxes, and only by
commodity exchange. This has to be made clear to the peasants, otherwise
they will think: what’s this, back again to the surplus-appropriation
system? I believe, therefore, that it were best not to add anything of this
kind.  Long years of revolution in Europe and civil war will lead to
commodity exchange without any tax at all. This is stated in the resolution
before the congress, which says that the tax will gradually be
reduced. This is the point the forthcoming victorious revolution applies
to, a revolution which a long period of years turns into a short one. 
2[3]

Comrades, it was on this point that we had discussions in
the committee, where opinion was divided. At first Milyutin objected to the
words “anarchic commodity ex-change to be combated” on the grounds that
this would be construed as cavilling, and freedom to trade would, in
practice, be done away with. When this point was drawn up in its present
wording, which said: “anarchic commodity exchange to be combated” since
“it eludes all control and supervision” -by this is meant the
black-market “bagmen”, and you know that illicit trade is punishable in
all countries where there is freedom of trading, even in capitalist
countries; on this point we see eye to eye. In what way is it to be
combated? By having commodity exchange concentrated chiefly in the hands of
the co-operatives, to which is added: “without, however, any restrictions
on regular free market operations.” When this wording was adopted the
committee unanimously agreed that there was still a danger of free market
operations being restricted. This is a delicate matter, of course. We don’t
want this ruling to restrict freedom to trade, but we can’t do without
measures against illicit trade, specifically against black-market bagmen
and transport dislocation. The committee thought of using a milder word
than “combating”, but then agreed that the target was only anarchic
commodity exchange that eluded all control on the part of the state, all
the more as this was qualified by the added

    

proviso, saying “without, however, any restrictions on regular free market
operations”. With this addition, the word “combat” is not too strong an
expression. The amendment which the comrade here proposes is risky in the
sense that we shall be defeating our own purpose. He throws out the words
“without, however, any restrictions on regular market operations ....”

3[4]

I think the state farms are not equal to this, they are
still very weak. Let them improve a bit for another year, and the next year
we shall see whether we can expand their initiative or not. 
4

The last amendment is an unhappy

one,[5] since the question of material resources is covered by
Point 5: “Revision of (certain sections of) production programmes for
large-scale industry with a view to increasing the manufacture of consumer
goods and peasant household articles. 

“Extension of the independence and initiative of each large
establishment in the matter of disposing of financial and material
resources. A precise decision to that effect to be submitted for approval
to the Council of People’s Commissars.” Therefore, we shall not repeat
this here. The question of material distribution, that of food, for
example, is stated here quite definitely, without prejudice, of course, to
the centre, because without it being gathered in the centre there can be no
question of industry. As regards the first remark of the comrade who said
that it was inappropriate just how to consider the question of the local
economic conferences settled, as these might upset things-1 have not heard
anything about this. On the contrary, there have been demands to introduce
economic conferences everywhere, acting as commissions of the C.P.C. Every
member of the C.P.C., every representative of the C.L.D. has the right of
appeal to the C.P.C. Because we select the members of the C.L.D. from among
the members of the C.P.C. itself, and locally, too, there are to be no
special staffs, no special

    

bodies, but the same offices and departments. The gubernia economic
conference is a perfectly suitable form, which does not hamper, but
facilitates the conference. As the Instructions say: “with leeway in
modifying the main type, that is, the executive committees may assume all
the functions and duties of the economic conferences...” (reads),
so that there is no ruling prescribing an absolutely hard-and-fast and
single course of action.  Besides, the resolution proposed by the
commission says: “Adopt in principle.” The

commission,[6] is meeting and functioning, its Chairman Osinsky tells
its they have reviewed quite a number of points and already submitted them
in writing. The work is of a difficult nature, and it will require another
special commission. The fear that we shall be tying our hands by declaring
that it is adopted in principle is therefore groundless. 
5[7]

We have no objection; judging by the subject, however, it
does not belong here, but to

Point 6.[8] I propose that it be adopted in principle and placed under
Point 6. 
6[9]

These are mere details. The question should be raised at
the session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and discussed
with the people concerned. There can be no objection in principle, but
generally speaking this is a detail. 
7[10]

This fear is excessive here. Point 7 of our resolution says
“The need to maintain and enforce the apparatus for the full and
expeditious collection of the tax in kind”. Naturally, the tax in kind
will be collected not by persuasion, it can be collected only by
compulsion, and that is what the apparatus stands for. Today several
important decisions and instructions have

    

been signed, all aimed at preserving and strengthening the apparatus, from
which we shall demand expeditious collection of the tax in kind. It is
pointed out that we say here: “commodity exchange is brought to the fore”
and the fear is expressed that the peasants will understand this as
priority for commodity exchange. In that case we shall write: “holds a
specially important place.” 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Tenth All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) was held in
Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921, It was attended by 239 delegates from Party
and Soviet organisations. It was a special con-ference. The following
questions were on the agenda: 1) economic policy: a) the tax in kind; b)
co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) the role of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the present situation; 3) the
Third Congress of the Comintern; 4) information on the Fourth Trade Union
Congress; 5) organisational question. 

The highlight of the conference was the question of
implement-ing the New Economic Policy, on which people in the local areas
were not yet quite clear. 

Lenin guided the work of the conference. He delivered
the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, made a report on the tax in kind
and wound up the debate on this question, and took the floor many times
during the discussion of the resolution “On Economic Policy”.  The
conference heard supplementary infor- mation by Lenin to the main report on
the work of the Fourth Trade Union Congress. Lenin also made a closing
speech. See present edition, Vol. 32, pp.
399-437. 



[2]
Lenin is referring to the amendment to Point I of the draft resolution
(see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 433). The mover of this amendment
proposed to add the words: “inasmuch as the conditions for a world
revolution have not changed”. This amendment was rejected by a majority
vote. 



[3]
Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 3
of the draft resolution. The end of this point read: “Anarchic commodity
exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control and state supervision)
to be combated by concentra-tion of exchange chiefly in the hands of the
co-operatives, without, however, any restrictions on regular free market
operations.” The mover of the amendment proposed that the end of the
sen-tence from the words “without, however” be replaced by the words:
“administration by mere injunction in the case of such exchange to be
eliminated”. The amendment was rejected. 



[4]
Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 5
of the draft resolution calling for an extension of the independence and
initiative of each large establishment in the matter of disposing of
financial and material resources. The mover of the amendment proposed that
this point should apply to the state farms as well. The amendment was
rejected. 



[5]
This refers to the amendment to Point 9 of the resolution proposing the
following addendum: “special attention being paid to factual and material
initiative and independence of the local areas”. The amendment was
rejected. 



[6]
This refers to the commission set up for drafting the Instructions of
the Council of Labour and Defence to local Soviet bodies. It was set up by
the Council on May 20, 1921. 



[7]
This refers to the amendment to Point 10 of the draft resolution
calling for the establishment of “special responsibility on the part of
the central agencies for any hampering of local initiative and insufficient
support of it” (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 435). The mover of the
amendment proposed the following addendum: “stronger punitive measures to
be taken against mismanagement and misappropriation of state property and
wasteful use of labour.” The amendment was adopted to Point 6 of the
resolution. 



[8]
Point 6 of the draft resolution concerned the regulation of workers’
wages. 



[9]
Lenin here took the floor in connection with Kiselyov’s proposal that a
point be included in the resolution calling for the intro duction of a
system of collective testimonials (by up to 3 people) for persons handling
state property, and listing the penalties incurred by the giver of such a
testimonial. The motion was rejected by a majority of votes. 



[10]
Lenin took the floor here in connection with the proposed amend-ment to
Point 2 of the resolution (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 433). Th mover
of the amendment proposed that the reso-lution should state that the tax in
kind is brought to the fore in economic activities. The amendment was
rejected.

Copies to the Chairman and Secretary of the All-Russia
Central Executive Committee 

28/V.1921
All People’s Commissars should have printed copies of
the circulated and distributed
Draft Instructions of the Council of Labour and
Defence

signed by Lenin and Chairman of the C.L.D Commission
Comrade Obolensky (Osinsky). 

This draft is being submitted to the session of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee opening at 1 p.m. on
30.V.1921. 

All People’s Commissars are obliged 

1) by 2 p.m. on Monday, 30.V.1921, to prepare in writing their
amendments and addenda to the Instructions on all points, items and
subitems directly or indirectly applying to the commissariats concerned;


2) within the same time, to prepare an initial draft of items (for
reporting) and subitems (i.e., a more detailed list of particular questions
to be reported on). This applies to all commissariats without exception, to
each People’s Commissar on behalf of his respective commissariat.

 

This is obligatory, since the All-Russia C.E.C. will endorse the
general Instructions consisting of two parts: a) the Instructions of the
C.L.D. covering reports by the economic commissariats; b) Instructions of
the C,P.C. covering reports of all commissariats without exception,
economic and non-economic. 

The latter reports will form the last, additional “Fifth Group of
Questions”. Each commissariat is to draw up a list of the most important
questions for the report on the same pattern as the questions Nos. 1 to 27
contained in the draft Instructions of the C.L.D. 

The reports will be printed in about 1000 copies by each Gubernia
Executive Committee and each Uyezd Executive Committee (the technical
possibilities of printing no less than I sheet a month by each uyezd have
been ascertained by me and arranged with the Paper Industry Board. Printing
and presentation of reports are planned for from 6 to 4 Limes a year, to be
finally decided upon by the All-Russia C.E.C. simultaneously with the
endorsement of these Instructions. 

Each People’s Commissar is obliged, by the above date (by 2 p.m. on
30.V.1921), to submit in writing, in 3-5 copies, a short list of the most
important questions to be included in the report of the respective
commissariat. 

V. Ulyanov (Lenin) 

Chairman, C.P.C. 

To be communicated immediately, in writing or by telephone,
with the commissar’s signature of receipt, and in his absence, with that of
his deputy, reporter or Board member.

The chief group responsible for registration should be made
up of old Party members (not less than 5-7 years in the Party), necessarily
workers. 

All members of the R.C.P. who are in any way dubious, unreliable, or
who have failed to prove their stability, should be removed from the Party,
with the right of re-admission upon further verification and test. 
1) People who joined from other parties after X.1917;

2) members from among officials and functionaries who had

    

held office under the old governments;

3) people who had held posts involving any privileges;

4) state employees—these categories should all be subject to a thorough
check-up, and workers, both Party and non-Party, who have had contact with
the given member of the R.C.P. at his work, should be questioned. 

Recommending members should be required to give an accurate, written
testimonial and should have among them several workers with a length of
Party membership of 5-7 years. 

Formalities should be reduced to a minimum in the case a of real
workers, actually working at their factory, and in the case of peasants
engaged on their allotments; such people should not be troubled with
reregistration. 
 

Notes

Lenin’s proposals were adopted at a meeting of the Politbureau on June
21, 1921, as directives for the Party Purge Commission. They were included,
with certain amendinents, in the decision of the Politbureau of June 25
concerning the check-up, revision and purge of the Party. In connection
with the drafting of this decision Lenin jotted down notes concerning the
conditions of admission to the Party (see Collected Works,  Fifth
[Russian] Edition, Vol. 43, p. 362). Lenin’s remarks were also taken into
consideration in the decision adopted by the Central Committee.

 Letter To O. W. Kuusinen and Remarks On The Draft
“Theses on the Organisational Activities of the Communist
Parties’ on the Methods and Content of their Work” 
To Comrade Kuusinen 

Urgent. 

Address: from Finnish comrades or at the Comintern.
10/VI. 

Comrade Kuusinen, 

I have read your article (3 chapters) and the theses with great
pleasure. 

I enclose my remarks in connection with the theses.. 
 

I advise you to immediately find a German comrade (a real
German) to improve the German text (of the article and the
theses). Perhaps this comrade, on your behalf, would read your article as
a report at the Third Congress (it would be much more convenient
for the German delegates to hear a

German.[7] 

My advice is—cross out the end (of the theses). 
Re propaganda and agitation—much greater detail—

especially
on the press, but also on verbal propaganda.


I think you should definitely take upon yourself the report I
this congress. I shall write to Zinoviev about this today. 

Best regards,

Yours,


Lenin 
 Theses 

(Thesis 6 or) § 6, 2nd Part, last sentence should read: 

“... will inevitably inherit this tendency to a certain 

extent from ... environment ....” 

And the next sentence should read: 

“... the Communist Party should overcome this tendency by
systematic and persistent organisational work and repeated
improvements and corrections ...... 

(Thesis 7 or) § 7: 

It should be stated at greater length that this is exactly what is
lacking in most of the legal parties of the West. There is no
everyday work (revolutionary work) by every member of
the Party. 

This is the chief drawback. 

To change this is the most difficult job of all. 

But this is the most important. 

§ 10. 

This needs amplifying. 

More details. 

Examples. 

The role of the newspaper. 

“Our” newspaper compared with the usual capitalist newspaper. 

Work for “our” newspaper.

 

Example: Russian newspapers of 1912-13. 

The fight against the bourgeois papers. Exposure of their venality,
their lies, etc. 

Distribution of leaflets. 

Home agitation. 

Sunday outings, etc. 

Far more details. 

§ 11—far more details here too. 

§ 13. Presenting reports and discussion of reports in the
“cells”. 

Reports on hostile and especially on petty-bourgeois
organisations (the Labour Party, the Socialist parties, etc.). 

Greater detail about duties among the mass of the unorganised
proletariat and of the proletariat organised in the yellow trade unions
(including the II and 111/2 Internationals) and the
non-proletarian sections of the working people. 

§ 26 and 27. 

This is irrelevant. 

This is not an “organisational question”. 

This subject had better be dealt with in a special article for the
Communist International, say: “Organisational Questions in
Revolutionary Periods” and so forth. 

Or: “On the Question of Mounting Revolution and Our Corresponding
Tasks” (on. the basis of Russian and Finnish experience).

Koenen[8] 
To Comrades Kuusinen and Koenen
9/VII.1921 
Dear Comrades,


I read your draft theses on the organisational question great
pleasure. I think you have done a very good job. May I suggest just two
addenda: 
 

1) advice-control commissions consisting of the best, tried and
experienced workers to be formed in all parties; 

2) re spies—a special point in connection with the question of
illegal work. Contents roughly as follows: the bourgeoisie is bound to
infiltrate spies and provocateurs into the illegal organisations. A
thoroughgoing and unremitting struggle should be waged against this, and a
method of struggle to be specially recommended is a skilful combination of
legal work with illegal, verification (of fitness for illegal
work) by means of prolonged legal

work.[9] 
With communist greetings,

Yours, 

Lenin

 3 
Remarks On The Draft Theses On Tactics For The Third
Congress Of The
Communist International 
Letter To G. Y. Zinoviev[10]

The crux of the matter is that Levi in very many respects is right
politically. Unfortunately, he is guilty of a number of breaches of
discipline for which the Party has expelled him. 

Thalheimer’s and Bèla Kun’s theses are politically utterly
fallacious. Mere phrases and playing at Leftism. 

Radek is vacillating and has spoilt his original draft by a number of
concessions to “Leftist” silliness. His first “concession” is highly
characteristic: in § 1 of his theses ”Umgrenzung der
Fragen” he first had “winning the majority of the working class
(to the principles of communism)” (mark this). Amended
(verballhornt) to: “winning the socially decisive sections of the
working class.” 

A gem! To weaken here, in such a context, the necessity of winning
precisely the majority of the working class “to the principles of
communism,” is the height of absurdity.

 

To win power, you need, under certain conditions (even when
the majority of the working class have already been won over
to the principles of communism) a blow dealt at the decisive place
by the majority of the socially decisive sections of the working
class. 

To modify, verballhornen, this truth in such a way that § 1 of
the general tasks of the Communist International about winning the working
class to the principles of communism weakens the idea about the
necessity of winning the majority of the working class, is a
classic example of Béla Kun’s and Thalheimer’s ineptitude (it looks all
right, dammit, but it’s all damn’d wrong) and of Radek’s... hasty
complaisance. 

Radek’s theses were much too long and boneless, and lacked a political
central point. And Radek diluted them still more, spoilt them
hopelessly. 

What’s to be done? I don’t know. So much time and effort wasted. 

If you don’t want an open fight at the congress, then I propose: 

1) that Thalheimer’s and B. Kun’s theses be rejected by exact voting
this very day (since Bukharin assures me that the basic points have to be
settled not later than today: they were better postponed) as being
basically erroneous. Have this recorded. You will spoil everything if you
don’t do this and show indulgence. 

2) that Radek’s first draft, “unimproved” by any corrections, one
specimen of which I have quoted, should be adopted as a basis. 

3) that 1-3 persons be entrusted with cutting down the text and
improving it so that it is no longer boneless (if that is possible!) and
clearly, precisely and unequivocally puts into focus as the central ideas
the following:

  

   

None of the Communist Parties anywhere have yet won the majority (of
the working class), not only as regards organisational leadership, but to
the principles of communism as well. This is the basis of everything. To
“weaken” this foundation of the only reasonable tactic is criminal
irresponsibility. 

Hence: revolutionary explosions are possible nevertheless very soon
considering the abundance of inflammable material

    

in Europe; an easy victory of the working class—in exceptionable
cases—is also possible. But it would be absurd now to base the tactics of
the Communist International on this possibility; it is absurd and harmful
to write and think that the propaganda period has ended and the period of
action has started. 

The tactics of the Communist International should be based on a steady
and systematic drive to win the majority of the working class,
first and foremost within the old trade unions. Then we shall win
for certain, whatever the course of events. As for “winning” for a short
time in an exceptionally happy turn of events—any fool can do that. 

Hence: the tactic of the Open

Letter[11] should definitely be applied everywhere. This should be said
straight out, clearly and exactly, because waverings in regard to the
“Open Letter” are extremely harmful, extremely shameful and


extremely widespread. We may as well admit this. All those who have
failed to grasp the necessity of the Open Letter tactic should be
expelled from the Communist International within a month after its
Third Congress. I clearly see my mistake in voting for the admission of

KAPD.[12] It will have to be rectified as quickly and fully as
possible. 

Instead of spinning a long yarn like Radek, we had better have the
whole text of the Open Letter translated (and in German quoted in full),
its significance properly brought home and adopted as a model. 

I would confine the general resolution on tactics to
this. 

Only then will the tone he set. The central idea will be
clear.  There will be no woolliness. No possibility of everyone reading his
own meaning into it (like in Radek’s). 

Radek’s original draft would then be cut down to a quarter, at
least. 

It is time we stopped writing and voting brochures instead of
theses. Under this system partial mistakes are inevitable with any of us,
even when the matter is indisputable. And when we have something boneless
and disputable we are bound to make b i g mistakes and spoil the
whole thing. 

And then, if you have the itch for it, you can add a supplement: on the
basis of such a tactic, specifically by way of example, precisely as an
example and not as a principle, we add so-and-so and so-and-so.

 

Further. 

To generalise Serrati and Levi into the same “opportunism” is
stupid. Serrati is guilty; of what? It should be said clearly and
precisely—on the Italian question, and not on the question of
general tactics. Of having split with the Communists and not having
expelled the reformists, Turati & Co. Until you have carried this
out, Italian comrades’ you are outside the Communist
International. We are expelling

you.[13] 
And to the Italian Communists—serious advice and the
demand: so long as you have not been able by persistence, patience
and skill to


convince and win over the majority of the Serratian
workers, don’t swagger, don’t play at Leftism.
“Fall

Levi”[1]

is not in general tactics, but in the
appraisal of

  Märzaktion,[2]

on the German question. Brandler says: there was a defensive. The
government provoked it. 

Assuming this is true, that it is a fact. 

What deduction is to be drawn from this? 

1) That all the shouting about an offensive—erroneous and absurd;


2) that it was a tactical error to call for a general
strike once there was provocation on the part of the government, who
wanted to draw the small fortress of communism into the struggle
(the district in the centre where the Communists already had a
majority). 

3) Mistakes like this must be avoided in future, as the situation
in Germany is a special one after the killing of 20,000 workers in
the civil war through the skilful manoeuvres of the Right. 

4) To call the defensive of hundreds of thousands of workers (Brandler
says a million. Isn’t he mistaken? Isn’t he exaggerating?
Why are there no figures by regions and cities???) a “putsch”’ and a
“Bakuninist putsch” at that, is worse than a mistake’ it is a breach of
revolutionary discipline. Since Levi added to this a number of other
breaches (list them very carefully and exactly) he deserves his punishment
and has earned his expulsion. 

The term of expulsion should be fixed, say, at six months at
least. He should then be permitted to seek readmission

    

to the Party, and the Communist International advises that he be readmitted
provided he has acted loyally during that time. 

I have not yet read anything, apart from Brandler’s pamphlet, and am
writing this on the basis of Levi’s and Brandler’s pamphlets. Brandler has
proved one thing—if he has proved anything—that the Märzaktion was not
a “Bakuninist putsch” [for such abusive language Levi ought to
be expelled] but a heroic defence by revolutionary workers, hundreds of
thousands of them; but however heroic it was, in future such a
challenge, provoked by the government, which, since 1.1919, has already
killed by provocations 20,000 workers should not be accepted until
the Communists have the majority behind them, all over the country, and not
just in one small district. 

((The July days of 1917 were not a Bakuninist putsch. For such an
appraisal we would have expelled a person from the Party. The July days
were an heroic offensive. And the deduction we drew was that we
would not launch the next heroic offensive prematurely. Premature
acceptance of a general battle—that is what the Märzaktion really
was. Not a putsch, but a mistake, mitigated by the heroism of a
defensive by hundreds of thousands.)) 

Concerning Šmeral. Can’t we have at least 2 or 3 documents?


There would be no harm in having at least 2 documents (24 pages each)
on each country printed for the Comintern. 

What are the facts about Šmeral? about Strasser? 

Do not forget one of the chief things—to delete from Radek’s first
theses everything relating to the “waiting party”, to its censure. It
must all come

out.[14] 

Regarding Bulgaria, Serbia (Yugoslavia?) and Czechoslovakia, the
question of these countries must be put concretely, specially,
clearly, and precisely. 

If opinion is divided on this, I suggest convening the
Politbureau.

Speeches At A Meeting Of Members Of The German, Polish,
Czechoslovak,
Hungarian And Italian Delegations

 July 11 

 I read certain reports yesterday in Pravda which have
persuaded me that the moment for an offensive is perhaps nearer than we
thought at the congress’ and for which the young comrades attacked us. I
shall deal with these reports later, however. Just now I want to say that
the nearer the general offensive is, the more “opportunistically” must we
act. You will now all return home and tell the workers that we have become
more reasonable than we were before the Third Congress. You should not be
put out by this; you will say that we made mistakes and now wish to act
more carefully; by doing so we shall win the masses over from the
Social-Democratic and Independent Social-Democratic parties, masses, who,
objectively, by the whole course of events, are being pushed towards us,
but who are afraid of us. I want to cite our own example to show you that we must act more carefully. 

At the beginning of the war we Bolsheviks adhered to a single
slogan—that of civil war, and a ruthless one at that. We branded as a
traitor everyone who did not support the idea of civil war. But when we
came back to Russia in March 1917 we changed our position entirely. When we
returned to Russia and spoke to the peasants and workers, we saw that they
all stood for defence of the homeland, of course in quite a different sense
from the Mensheviks, and we could not call these ordinary workers and
peasants scoundrels and traitors. We described this as “honest
defencism”. I intend to write a big article about this and publish all the
material. On April 7 I published my theses, in which I called for caution
and

      patience.[3]

Our original stand at the beginning of the war was correct: it was
important then to form a definite and resolute core. Our subsequent stand
was correct too. It proceeded from the assumption that the masses had to be
won over. At that time we already rejected the idea of the immediate
overthrow of the Provisional Government.  I wrote: “It should be
overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, and not a people’s government, and is
unable to provide peace or bread. But it cannot be overthrown just now’ for
it is being kept in power by the workers’ Soviets and so far enjoys the
confidence of the workers. We are not Blanquists, we do not want to rule
with a minority of the working class against the

     majority.”[4]

The Cadets, who are shrewd politicians, immediately noticed the
contradiction between our former position and the new one, and called us
hypocrites. But as, in the same breath, they had called us spies, traitors,
scoundrels and German agents, the former appellation made no
impression. The first crisis occurred on April 20.  Milyukov’s Note on the
Dardanelles showed the government up for what it was an imperialist
government. After this the armed masses of the soldiery moved against the
building of the government and overthrew Milyukov. They were led by a
non-Party man named Linde. This movement had not been organised

    

by the Party. We characterised that movement at the time as follows:
something more than an armed demonstration, and something less than an
armed uprising. At our conference on April 22 the Left trend demanded the
immediate over-throw of the Government. The Central Committee, on the
contrary, declared against the slogan of civil war, and we instructed all
agitators in the provinces to deny the outrageous lie about the Bolsheviks
wanting civil war. On April 22 I wrote that the slogan “Down with the
Provisional Government” was incorrect’ since if we did not have the
majority of the people behind us this slogan would he either an empty
phrase or

     adventurism.[5]


We did not hesitate in face of our enemies to call our Leftists
“adventurists”. The Mensheviks crowed over this and talked about our
bankruptcy. But we said that any attempt to be slightly, if only a wee bit,
left of the C.C. was folly, and those who stood left of the C.C.  had lost
ordinary common sense. We refuse to be intimidated by the fact that our
enemies rejoice at our slips. 

Our sole strategy now is to become stronger, hence cleverer, more
sensible, more “opportunistic”, and that is what we must tell the
masses. But after we shall have won over the masses by our reasonableness,
we shall use the tactic of offensive in the strictest sense of that
word. 

Now about the three reports: 

1) The strike of Berlin’s municipal workers. Municipal workers are
mostly conservative people, who belong to the Social-Democrats of the
majority and to the Independent Social-Democratic Party; they are well off,
but are compelled to

strike.[16] 

2) The strike of the textile workers in

Lille.[17] 

3) The third fact is the most important. A meeting was held in Rome to
organise the struggle against the fascists, in which 50,000 workers took
part—representing all parties—Communists, socialists and also republicans.
Five thousand ex-servicemen came to the meeting in their uniforms and not a
single fascist dared to appear on the

street.[18] This shows that there is more inflammable material in
Europe than we thought. Lazzari praised our resolution on tactics. It is an

    

important achievement of our congress. If Lazzari admits it, then the
thousands of workers who back mm are bound to come to us, and their leaders
will not be able to scare them away from us.  “Il faut reculer, pour mieux
sauter” (you have to step back to make a better jump). This jump is
inevitable’ since the situation, objectively, is becoming
insufferable. 

So we are beginning to apply our new tactic. We mustn’t get nervy, we
cannot be late, rather we may start too early, and when you ask whether
Russia will be able to hold out so long, we answer that we are now fighting
a war with the petty bourgeoisie’ with the peasantry, an economic war,
which is much more dangerous for us than the last war. But as Clausewitz
said, the element of war is a danger and we have never been out of that
danger for a moment. I am sure that if we act more cautiously, if we make
concessions in time, we shall win this war too, even if it lasts over three
years. 

Summing up: 

1) All of us, unanimously throughout Europe, shall say that we are
applying the new tactic, and in this way we shall win the masses. 

2) Co-ordination of the offensive in the most important countries:
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy. We need here preparation, constant
co-ordination. Europe is pregnant with revolution, but it is impossible to
make up a calendar of revolution beforehand. We in Russia will hold out,
not only five years’ but more. The only correct strategy is the one we have
adopted. I am confident that we shall win positions for the revolution
which the Entente will have nothing to put up against, and that will be the
beginning of victory on a world scale.

Šmeral seemed to be pleased with my speech, but he interprets it
one-sidedly. I said in the committee that in order to find the correct line
Šmeral had to make three steps to the left, and Kreibich one step to the
right. Šmeral, unfortunately, said nothing about taking these steps. Nor
did he say anything about his views on the situation. Concerning the difficulties, Šmeral merely repeated the old arguments and said nothing new.
Šmeral said that I had dispelled his fears. In the spring he was afraid that
the communist leadership would demand of him untimely action, but events
dispelled these fears. But what worries us now is this: will things really
come to the stage of preparation for the offensive in Czechoslovakia, or
will they be confined merely to talk about difficulties. The Left mistake
is simply a mistake, it isn’t big and is easily rectified. But if the
mistake pertains to the resolution to act, then this is by no means a small
mistake, it is a betrayal. These mistakes do not bear comparison. The
theory that we shall make a revolution, but only after others have acted
first, is utterly fallacious. 
 3 

The retreat made at this congress can, I think, be compared
with our actions in 1917 in Russia, and therefore prove that this retreat
must serve as preparation for the offensive. Our opponents will say that we
are not saying today what we said before. It will do them little good, but
the working-class masses will understand us if we tell them in what sense
the March action is to be considered a success and why we criticise its
mistakes and say that we should make better preparations in future. I agree
with Terracini when he says that the interpretations of Šmeral and Burian
are wrong. If co-ordination is to be understood as our having to wait until
another country has started, a country that is richer and has a bigger
population, then this is not a communist interpretation, but downright
deception. Co-ordination should consist in comrades from other countries
knowing exactly what moments are significant. The really important
interpretation of co-ordination is this: the best and quickest imitation of
a good example. That of the workers of Rome is a good example.

The Third Congress of the Communist International was held in
Moscow from June 22 to July 12, 1921. It was attended by 605 delegates (291
voting delegates and 314 with a consultative voice) representing 103
organisations from 52 countries, namely: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist
Parties, 28 Youth Leagues, 4 syndicalist organisations’ 2 opposition
Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and the Workers’
Communist Party of Spain) and 13 other organisations. The 72 delegates from
the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were headed by Lenin. 

The congress discussed the world economic crisis and
the new tasks of the Communist International; the report on the activity of
the Executive Committee of the Communist International; the Communist
Workers’ Party of Germany; the Italian question; the tactics of the
Communist International; the attitude of the Red International Council of
Trade Unions to the Communist International; the struggle against the
Amsterdam International; the tactics of the R.C.P.(B.); the Communist
International and the Communist youth movement; the women’s movement; the
United Communist Party of Germany, and other questions. 

All the work of preparing for the congress and
conducting its activities was directed by Lenin. He wrote the “Theses for
a Report on the Tactics of the R.C.P.(B.)” which were adopted by the
congress; he spoke on the Italian question; in defence of the tactics of
the Communist International; delivered a report on the tactics of the
R.C.P.(B.); took a leading part in drafting all the key resolutions; spoke
in the committees and at the enlarged sittings of the Executive Committee
of the Comintern and at the delegates’ meetings. See present edition,
Vol. 32’ pp. 451-06. 

The “Theses on the Organisational Activities of the
Communist Parties, on the Methods and Content of Their Work” for the Third
Congress of the Communist International were drafted by 0. W.  Kuusinen. On
June 6’ 1921’ he sent Lenin part of the article he had written on the
organisational question and the theses on which the article was based. In
accordance with Lenin’s remarks Kuusinen redrafted the theses and sent them
again to Lenin on June 17 (without points 25-29 dealing with the Party
press); on June 21 the rest of the theses were sent (points
25-29). Apparently Lenin read this variant of the theses again. On June 27
Kuusinen sent Lenin a third variant of the theses on the organisational
question revised on the basis of Lenin’s instructions. The theses were
revised also with the co-operation of the German Communist Wilhelm
Koenen. On July 9 Lenin approved the theses and gave his final remarks and
addenda to them. (see pp. 3l8-19 of this volume). After discussion in the
Committee the theses, with slight amendments, were adopted on July 12 by
the Third Congress of the Communist International (see The Communist
International in Documents.  Decisioiis, Theses and Appeals of the
Congresses of the Comintern and Plenary Meetings of the Executive Committee
of the Communist International, 1919-1932. Moscow, 1933, pp. 201-25).

Lenin’s remarks were taken into consideration by 0. W. Kuusinen and

[10]
This document was written in connection with the drafting of the theses
on tactics for the Third Congress of the Communist International. The work
of drafting the theses was entrusted to the Russian delegation to the
congress. 

On June 1, 1921, K. B. Radek sent Lenin a draft of the
theses containing amendments proposed by A. Thaiheimer and Bela Kun and
their own draft. On the envelope containing these materials Lenin jotted
down his initial remarks on the draft theses on tactics (see Collected
Works, Vol. 44 Fifth Russian Edition, p. 435) and then wrote out his
remarks in full as printed lower down. 

In accordance with Lenin’s directions the draft theses
on tactics were revised, discussed at preliminary meetings with a number of
delegations and tabled at the Third Congress in the name of the Russian
delegation. On July 1, Lenin delivered a speech at the congress in defence
of the tactics of the Comintern (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp.
468-77). On July 12, the theses were unanimously adopted by the congress
(see The Communist International in Documents, etc. Moscow, 1933,
pp. 180-201). 



[11]
The Open Letter (Offener Brief) of the Central Committee of
the United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of Germany,
the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Ger  many, the Communist
Workers’ Party of Germany and all trade unions was published in Die Rote
Fahne on January 8, 1921. The U.C.P.G. called on all workers, trade unions
and socialist organisations to unite their forces in combating the growing
reaction and the capitalists’ attack upon the working people’s vital
rights. Their programme of joint action included demands for higher
pensions for disabled war veterans; elimination of unemployment;
improvement of the country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies;
introduction of factory committee control over all stocks of food, raw
materials and fuel; restarting of all closed enterprises; control over
sowing, harvesting and marketing of all farm produce by the Peasants’
Councils together with the agricultural labourers’ organisations; immediate
disarming nd disbanding of all bourgeois militarised organisations;
establishment of workers’ self-defence; amnesty for all political
prisoners; immediate resumption of trade and diplomatic relations with
Soviet Russia. Lenin commented very favourably on the Open Letter (see
Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 221). 

The Right-wing leaders of the organisations to which
the Open Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action with
the Commiinists, despite the fact that the workers came outfor a united
front of the proletariat. 



[12]
KAPD (Kommunistische Arbeiter Partei Deutschlands)—Communist
Workers’ Party of Germany was formed in April 1920 by “T,eft”
Communists,. who had been expelled from the Communist Party of Germany at
the Heidelberg Congress in 1919. In November 1920, in order to facilitate
the unification of all German communist forces and meet the wishes of thel
best proletarian elements within it, the C.W.P.G. was temporarily admitted
into the Comintern with the rights of a sympathising member. The Executive
Committee of the Comintern, however, still regarded the United Communist
Party of Germany as the only fully-authorised section of the
Comintern. C.W.P.G.’s representatives were admitted into the Comintern on
the condition that they merged with the United Communist Party of Germany
and supported all its activities. The Third Congress of the Comintern, in,
order to win over the workers who still followed the lead of the C.W.P.G.,
decided to give the latter two to three months to call a congress and
settle the question of amalgamation. The Executive Committee, on behalf of
the Third Congress, adopted an appeal “To the Members of the Communist
Workers’ Party of Germany” setting forth the decision of the congress and
urging the C.W.P.G. to abandon its sectarian policy and unite with the
U.C.P.G. The C.W.P.G. leadership failed to comply with the decision of the
Third Congress and continued their splitting activities; The Executive of
the Comintern was compelled to break off relations with the party. The
C.W.P.G. thus found itself outside the Communist International. Eventually
the C.W.P.G. degenerated into a small sectarian group having no support
among, and hostile to, the working class of Germany. 



[13]
The Italian question was referred to the Third Congress of the
Comintern following the protest of the Italian Socialist Party against the
decision of the Comintern’s Executive to exclude it from the Communist
International and recognise the Communist Party of Italy as the only
section of the Comintern in Italy. 

The Third Congress of the Communist International
adopted the following decision on the ISP. on June 29, 1921: “The Italian
Socialist Party cannot belong to the Communist International so long as the
participants of the reformists’ conference at Reggio-Emilia and their
supporters have not been expelled from the party. 

“In the event of this preliminary condition being
fulfilled the Third World Congress will authorise its Executive to take the
necessary steps to bring about a union between the Italian Socialist Party,
after it has cleared its ranks of all reformist and Centrist elements, and
the Communist Party of Italy, and transform both organisations into a
unified section of the Communist International” (The Communist
International in Documents. Decisions, Theses and Appeals of the Congresses
of the Comintern and Plenary Meetings of the Executive Committee of the
Communist International. 1919-1932. Moscow, 1933, p. 164). The Italian
Socialist Party, however, failed to carry out this decision of the Third
Congress. 

A Left faction of “Third-Internationalists”
(G. M. Serrati, F. Maffi and others) was formed within the Italian
Socialist Party in the spring of 1923, which was for amalgamation with the
Communist Party of Italy. In August 1924 the Third Internationalists merged
with the Communist Party of Italy. 



[14]
Lenin is apparently referring to the following text of the initial
draft theses on the question of the tactics of the Communist international
submitted by K.  B. Radek: “Seeing that the Communist International wishes
to creat only truly revolutionary mass parties, they [what Radek calls
Centrist groups in the Communist Parties of a number of
countries.—Editor] are making a big noise about the Comintern
falling into sectarianism. This is what the Levi group in Germany, the
Smeral group in Czechoslo-vakia, etc., are doing. The nature of these
groups is quite clear. They are Centrist groups; who cloak the policy of
passive waiting for the revolution with communist phrases and theories. The
Smeral group put off the organisation of a Communist Party in
Czechoslovakia at a time when the majority of the Czechoslovak workers had
taken a communist stand” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.). 



[15]
B.  Smeral’s report at the Inaugural Congress of the Communist Party of
Czechoslovakia was published in abridged form in the newspaper Vrwdrts,
around which were grouped the Czechoslovak Lefts headed by
K. Kreibich. 

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Tactics
Committee. The section of the theses on tactics dealing with the Communist
Party of Czechoslovakia was worded in accordance with his proposal. 



[16]
At the beginning o July 1921 the employees of Berlin’s municipal
services decided to call a strike for higher pay. The strike was decided on
by a majority of the workers (about 80,000). The reformists, however,
succeeded in preventing the strike. Following negotiations between the
representatives of the employees and the Berlin Municipal Council, on which
sat Social-Democrats, the employees’ pay was slightly raised. 



[17]
Early in July 1921 the cotton-mill workers of Lille (France) went on
strike against wage cuts by the mill-owners. The strike spread to a number
of departments.  Early in September the workers of the Northern district of
France declared a general strike. Although the workers staunchly carried on
the fight for two months, the strike failed as a result of the reformist
tactics of the trade union leadership and unfavourable economic
conditions. 



[18]
The mass meeting of the workers in Rome, which was held on July 8,
1921, was fully reported in Pravda No. 149 on July 10, 1921.

    POINT “A” 

A five-man commission to be charged with collecting the fullest
possible material for an estimation of both payments in kind and actual
money payments, embracing all and every form of such payment without
exception, including cab fares, etc., which are now being applied in
Moscow’s central institutions. 
 POINT “D” 

Collective supply both for workers and office employees is to be
introduced subject to the following rules: 

1) each enterprise where collective supply is introduced concludes a
special agreement with the Government; 

2) under this agreement, the enterprise (in the person of its
management and specially elected representatives) undertakes to steadily
reduce the number of workers and office employees and raise their
productivity, as well as work discipline to a normal level. An enterprise
in industry corresponds to a department or subdepartment, etc., for state
employees; 

3) non-fulfilment of the agreement entails a penalty, including total
loss of supply. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The draft decision on collective pay for employees of state
institutions was discussed in the C. P.C. on June 14, 21 24 and 28 and
July 8, 1921. The system of collective supply was designed to replace that
of individual supply by ration coupons and lists as well as bonuses paid in
kind. The workers and office employees received remuneration exclusively in
the form of wages and salaries, the amount of which was fixed for each
enterprise as a whole, i.e., collectively for all the workers and office
staffs. On June 24 the C.P.C. passed a decision adopting the system of
collective pay for employees of state institutions in Moscow and Petrograd
as from July 1. and in the remaining districts of the Republic not earlier
than September 1, and setup a commission to complete "the draft in order to
determine, on the basis of at least limited approximate data, what the
number of Soviet employees will be after the reduction and what their pay
is in money and in kind. On June 28, 1921, the C.P.C., followng reports by
A.B. Khalatov and L. I. Ginsburg, passed its decision on collective pay for
employees in state institutions with amendments to Point “A” proposed by
Lenin and with his wording of Point “D”. The final text of the Council’s
decision was adopted on July 8, 1921.

If an area affected by crop failure and famine embraces a
territory with a population of twenty-five million, should we not, by a
number of revolutionary measures, take young men into the army from


this particular area to the number of about 500,000 (or even
perhaps up to I million?). 

Purpose: to help out the famine-stricken population to some extent, as
we shall feed some of them and perhaps help others by means of parcels
which the men will send home. That is one thing. Secondly: locate these
half a million in the Ukraine, where they can help to step up food supply
work, in which. they are deeply concerned, keenly aware as they are of the
injustice of the gluttony practised by the rich peasants in the
Ukraine. 

The harvest in the Ukraine is estimated roughly (Rakovsky) at 550-650
million poods. Deducting


150 million poods for sowing and 300 (15 x 20 =
300) for feeding the family and the farm animals, we get a balance
(550-450=1 0 0; 650—450 = 2 0 0) at an average of about


1 5 0 million
poods. If we post an army from the famine-stricken gubernias in the Ukraine
this balance (tax 4- barter + .special requisitions from the rich to help
the starving) could be collected in full. 

Measures should immediately be stepped up in the famine-stricken
gubernias to collect raw materials (hides, hoofs, horns, bristles, etc.,
etc.) and it should be made a rule, incidentally, that not a pood of relief
should be rendered either for seed or food unless payment is made in one or
another form of raw materials or fallen wood fuel or similar

stuff.[1]


To revive the work of the gubernia, uyezd and district economic
conferences of Petrograd, Moscow, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and a few principal
industrial centres not far from the two capital cities, could not, 2-4
top-level workers of the

    

central departments be assigned to each of these economic conferences?
These groups of, say, four people, could work together as a team, being
selected from among the staff of one and the same central institution or
being well acquainted with each other, and they could do regular work in
these economic councils, say, an hour a day each, making 3-4 hours a day
together? 

The complete or partial transfer of workers of the non-economic
commissariats to economic work could be arranged in this way: their work at
the commissariat could be shifted to the extent of three-fourths or
nine-tenths to third-rate assistants, whom they could supervise. 

In Moscow (and afterwards in other places) all top-level Party workers
should be mobilised for economic


work in this way: 

every top-level Party worker of a


non-economic commissariat

takes a low-level economic job, for which purpose he joins some
factory committee (or house or block committee)—no organisation
higher titan that (in order to work at low-level)—and undertakes
to devote no less than two hours a day to this work. Priority is to be
given to the work of distributing foodstuffs, raising the level of the
economic branch concerned, and fuel supply. 

It is important that each worker’s assignment should be
precisely defined. 

Should we not, simultaneously with the registration of top-level Party
workers on 1.VII.1921, organise the registration of all members of the
R.C.P. in Moscow (and perhaps in Petrograd as well?)? Enlist for this the
services of the Gubernia Statistical Bureau. Obtain exact figures on the

Party.[2]

In view of the famine that attacked the Volga region and south Ukraine
in 1921, the Politbureau on July 9, 1921, passed a decision for the
transfer of a maximum number of Communists to food supply work. 

Lenin’s “Notes” were written apparently in
preparation for the discussion of this question at the meeting of the
Politbureau.

The question of Centrosoyuz was discussed at a meeting of the C.P.C. on
July 15, 1921 which heard reports by L. M. Khinchuk “On the Organisation
of Commodity Exchange and the Need for Speeding Up and Expanding Work in
This Direction” and N. P. Bryukhanov “On Supervision Over Centrosoyuz in
Pursuance of the Decision of the Council of People’s Commissars of June 14’
1921, With a View to Obtaining the Maximum Amount of Grain Through
Commodity Exchange”. A single resolution was adopted on both reports
incorporating Lenin’s proposals.

I move: 

1) that the matter be temporarily decided (today, 28/VII.) in favour of
the Siberian Bureau; 

2) that a resolution of censure be passed on the Siberian Bureau for
patent breach of Party duty in not simultaneously forwarding the text of
the motions tabled by the two other trends: the Siberian Bureau should have
asked the two other trends officially and in good time for the texts of
their. proposals for submission to the C.C.; 

3) that Omsk be asked to wire a brief formulation of the motions of the
two trends by their spokesmen; 

4) that the Party conference be postponed till 15/8; 
 

5) that a C.C. member be found to sit in on the conference on
15/8. 

28/7. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This motion was drafted in connection with the theses of the Siberian
Bureau of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) and the Siberian
Revolutionary Committee “On the Forms of Organisation of Siberian Soviet
Institutions and Siberian Party Bodies”. The theses put the ease for the
necessity of having in Siberia a regional Soviet centre with corresponding
economic and military departmepts, an agency of the Vecheka and a regional
Party centre. Both these centres, in the view of the Siberian Bureau and
Siberian Revolutionary Committee, were to be built on the principle of
appointment. 

The covering memorandum stated that the question would
be discussed at the forthcoming Fourth Siberian Regional Party Conference
at which spokesmen of two trends were expected to state their views: one,
which denied the need for Siberian regional centres, and the other, which
recognised the need for their creation on the elective principle. The
theses of the Siberian Bureau were endorsed as a whole by the Orgbureau of
the C.C. on July 29, 1921. 

Points 4 and 5 in the manuscript wore crossed out by
Lenin.

To Comrade Zinoviev


13/VIII-1921

Obviously, we cannot properly organise in Russia a bureau
for properly summarising and selecting information on the international
labour movement. We haven’t the people for it, nor the libraries, etc. 

I suggest that such a bureau be set up in Germany. Employ one manager
(a non-work-fit Communist, better still a non-Communist) plus 2
assistants (+2-3 typists).  
 

A definite monthly sum should be earmarked for this purpose. We should
try to arrange legally, under some trade name, something like
Zeitungskorrespondenz, a supply of articles and copy to the
newspapers. 

Three Germans (knowing English, French, Italian and Czech—enough to
start with) could of course be found. Radek, if I am not mistaken, even had
someone in mind. 

This bureau, if we could find efficient men to run it under contract
(intellectuals in Germany are hard up, and we could select a good staff),
would carry on systematic research work for us in collecting
literary and special newspaper material and working it up on two
cardinal and main points: 

A) international imperialism; 

B) the international labour movement. 

We could (with Radek and with his help) probably find 2-3
dozen Communists doing journalistic work in all countries to act as
contributors (and writer-consultants) to this bureau. 

Such a bureau would work for a start in German (for the continent of
Europe now undoubtedly the most international language); and at the first
opportunity it would add to its publications translations into French and
English. Russian translations could easily be arranged: we would simply
give the job through official state channels to 2-3 bourgeois professors,
so as not to divert communist forces on purely technical work. 

On both these questions (A and B) the bureau should systematically keep
abreast of the international literature, especially newspaper literature,
and compile lists of valuable books and newspaper articles on
these questions. 

The most important thing here would be to detail and arrange these
questions correctly—to compile a rational and classified
list of these questions and supplement it in good time according
to the needs of the moment. 

And then—commentaries of not more than 3-10 lines on books and on
very rare and specially important newspaper articles (1 out of 100,. or
maybe I out of 500), so that you can tell at once what to look for and what
the respective book or article deals with. 
 

The writer-consultants could write these commentaries (or rather a
statement of the contents) easily, if the German centre organised this work
and paid them for it. 

Further, the bureau should run a summary of important items of
information from the newspapers and press-cuttings (at least 3-4 sets
to begin with: one for the files, one for Moscow, and one extra set to meet
any contingency). 

With the help of consultants and Radek at their head, we could
make up a list of subjects, for example: 

— —shadings and controversial issues within communism; 

— — " " " and on the fringe of communism

      (II½[1]
 and anarchists); 

— —    " " " also within the trade
union movement; 

— — elections and their statistics (or results) to judge the strength
of the trends in the labour movement;


— —the history of outstanding strikes
and “incidents” (demonstrations, actions, etc.) and so on. 

I believe that, properly organised, this bureau would bring in a
certain income, as its bulletins would be purchased by certain newspapers
and libraries as important information material. 

But this income, of course, would at best cover only a small part of
the expenses. We can and should bear these expenses. All the material, as
far a. we are concerned, will serve the cause of public education and the
work of propaganda and agitation. 

Such a bureau can and should be organised. It can be very
useful. Without it we have no eyes, ears or hands for participation in the
international movement—and we do it casually, always dependent
(for information) on someone who is closer, near at hand, who has happened
to read about it, who has just dropped in, happened to mention it, and so
on. 

I propose that the Politbureau discuss this plan and set up a small
commission for its preliminary drafting, say: 
 Radek

Trotsky

 + ? 
    

Perhaps only two would be better to start with. They can enlist
the co-operation of Steklov and Béla Kun (and many others), invite to
Moscow a candidate for the post of bureau manager, and then be
able to make up an estimate and submit the whole
elaborated plan to the Politbureau for

consideration.[2] 
16/ VIII. 
Lenin 
 

Notes
 

[1]
Meaning the Centrist II½ International.—Ed. 
 



[2]
The question of setting up an information bureau abroad to collect
material on the international labour movement was discussed at the
Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern on August 17,
1921. Lenin’s proposal was adopted. 

Shortly afterwards E. Varga sent Learn his project for
the ”Organisation of Information in the Comintern Executive”. This called
for the establishment of an Information Institute which would supply the
Comintern Executive with the necessary material. The project suggested
methods of work for the Institute ay’d outlined instructions for compiling
socio-eonomic reports and political information. 

On August 31, 1921, Lenin sent Varga his remarks on the
projectct—“Tentative Amendments or Theses” (see pp. 337.39 of this
volume). 

Lenin’s letter of September 1, 1921 (see p. 339 of this
volume) was a reply to Varga’s letter dated August 31, 1921, on the subject
of Lenin’s theses or, the organisation of an Information Institute, in
which Varga reported that there were “deep-going basic differences in
regard to the aims of such an Institute”, Trotsky, Zinoviev and Radek,
wrote Verge, considered that this Institute was designed primarily to
supply information for the internal use of the Comintern Executive. “In
your theses, on the other hand, the weight of emphasis seems to be on
press information on the labour movement in Central Europe, whereas
information for the Comintern Executive is relegated to the
background. This change of aim affects all other changes (legality,
complete inde-pendence of the Comintern)”. “Consequently, it would be
neces-sary to decide in principle: is the aim of the Institute to be. a)
information for. the Comintern Executive? b) influencing the labour press
by its publications? c) linking both aims? All questions of organisation
depend, it seems to me, on the solution of this question” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.). The
plan for setting up an Information Institute did not materialise.

I advise that greater attention be given to this case and
the gravity of the charges be checked, and in the event of their being
incontrovertibly proved, of which there seems to be no doubt, a public
trial should be held with the greatest speed and the death penalty
imposed. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This motion was written in connection with a telegram from the Chairman
of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee I. N. Smir-nov dated August 26,
1921, reporting the arrest of Baron Ungern. 

The Pohitbureau adopted Lenin’s motion. 

The trial of Baron Umigern took place on September
15. During the hearing a long list of atrocities committed by Ungern and
his underlings was revealed. On capturing Urgu (now Ulan-Bator) he ordered
all the employees of Centrosoyuz and the Town Council to be shot. On his
orders the peaceful inhabitants were robbed and killed and the town was
burnt down. The trial brought to light Baron Ungerr.’s ties with the
Chinese militarists (Chang Tso-lin) and Japanese interventionists. Baron
Ungern was sentenced to death.

Dear Comrade Varga, 

I enclose my remarks. If you think it necessary, we can talk things
over on the telephone. 

Best regards,

 Lenin
 31/8
Tentative Amendments or Theses

To Comrade B. Varga’s Project for the Organisation of an
Information Institute 

1. Absolute and strict legality of the Institute for Berlin
or Vienna conditions and for the whole of Western Europe, Britain and
America. 

2. Headquarters of the Institute-Berlin or Vienna or Copenhagen or
Christiania. 

3. No more than 20% of the Institute’s working time and publications
should be devoted to economic and social questions (both together 20%). 80%
to political questions. 

4. As far as political questions are concerned, the task of the
Institute is only to collect objective data on questions that are legal and
open to discussion. 

5. The Institute must be completely independent of the respective
Communist Parties. 

6. The official name of the Institute should be, tentatively:
Institute for the Study of Forms of Social Movement. 

7. Instructions of a principle nature are to be given to the head (or
to three heads, not more) of the Institute. 

8. On the basis of verbal instructions of a principle nature the head
is to work out detailed and absolutely legal instructions and submit them
here in Moscow for endorsement by the Comintern Executive. 
 

9. Reports to be submitted weekly or twice a week. Socio-economic
appendixes monthly or twice-monthly. 

10. The Institute must have no contacts whatever with the Russian
embassies. 

11. The Institute must begin in a small way. For the German-speaking
countries, Scandinavia and the Slav countries—only the German
language. 

Activities may be extended to Anglo-Saxon and Romance countries only on
the basis of a special agreement with a representative of each group of
these countries. Agreement only here in Moscow. 

12. The reports, or rather, publications, or correspondence of the
Institute should be paid for by subscribers (newspapers libraries,
etc.). 

The basic principle should be such an organisation of the Institute and
such operation as would compel all labour newspapers of all trends
to subscribe to the Institute’s publications and pay for them. If this does
not happen, it will be proof that the Institute is worthless. 

13. Comrade Varga’s

project[1] should serve as initial draft instructions. In particular,
two basic amendments to this project are needed: 1)



§ 3-up; 2) the
political part should be considerably elaborated. 

Some remarks to this Point 2: 

(Appendix B.) § 3 and 4: Correspondence from factories? 

+ money collected by the workers themselves? 

+ questions of the trade union movement should be specially
dealt with in detail from the political angle. Winning the trade unions is
one of the most important political issues. 

+ workers’ co-operatives: ditto (to Section II, b) 

+ all transitional


political formations (like the workers’ and farmers’ party in the
United States) are especially important. 

+ Leaflets? Distribution? Circulation? 



+ attitude to the 1914-18 war? Extremely important. 

Section II, § a “revolutionary” (??) workers’ parties like the
Communist Workers’ Party of Germany. 

Name is wrong. They are not revolutionary. They should be called:
semi-anarchist, anarchist or near-anarchist. 
 

It is necessary to add: a split of anarchism all over 

the world in patriotic and internationalist questions; for the
Soviet system; against the Soviet system. 

(b). Parties of the II and II 1/2 Internationals—much more
detailed. 

+ attitude to own colonies—and to imperialism in practical
politics—much, much more detailed. 

+ all pacifist and petty-bourgeois-democratic groups and
trends—much more detailed. 

And so on. 

31/8.1921

Notes
 
 



[1]
E. Varga’s project for the “Organisation of Information in the
Comintern Executive” contained two appendixes: “A pendix A- Instructions
on Compiling Socio-Economic Reports” and “Appendix B.—Instructions on
Compiling Reports on the Political Situation Within the Country”. The
instructions under Appendix A covered: 

1. The purpose of the reports, which was to give a
dynamic picture of the development of the revolutionary movement in the
country and its analysis. 

2. Four factors conditioning revolutionary development:


a) the Communist Party—the motive force of the
revolutionary movement; 

b) the proletariat—the revolutionary masses; 

c) the ruling classes—the enemy; 

d) The petty-bourgeois middle strata. 

The report must show the alignment of forces. 

3. The starting-point should be an account of the
economic situation, the social position of the proletariat and the middle
strata. 

4. The report should consist of a brief review (5-10
pages) with a detailed appendix to it. 

The instructions under Appendix B contained the
following, sections: 1) Communist Parties; II) non-communist proletarian
parties; III) bourgeois parties; IV) organisation of the armed forces. 

Lenin refers to § 3 and 4 of Section I
(“Communist Parties”) of Varga’s instructions (Appendix B) which deal
with legal and illegal Party cells, the promulgation of Party literature,
appeals, pamphlets and books and the issue of illegal Party
literature.

Dear Comrade Varga, 

I consider it incorrect to put the question that way (supplying
information to the Comintern Executive or to the labour press or
to both?). 

We need full and truthful information. And the truth
should not depend upon whom it has to serve. 

We can accept only the division into unofficial information
(for the Comintern Executive only) and official information
(for everybody). 

The former already exists and must exist separately;it must be
improved. 

The latter, to become good, requires good organisation in the
selection of facts without a declaration that “we” are
Communists. 

If the selection of facts is full, exact and goody then the
yellow labour press, too (especially the local and trade union newspapers)
will certainly buy and pay for our material. If that does not happen it
will be evidence of our poor legal work. 

With communist greetings,

 Lenin


1/IX.1921

a) The Russian members of the Executive shall be instructed to obtain a
decision of the Comintern for organising accurate current statistics of
workers’ donations in Europe for sufferers of the famine in Russia and
regularly publishing reports of such donations. 

h) The Central Committee draws special attention to the need for
stepping up agitation among the workers in Europe for contributing
one-day’s pay, as one of the most expedient forms of relief for the
famine-stricken. 

c) The Russian members of the Comintern shall be asked to submit a
report on the progress of this propaganda to the Politbureau within a
fortnight. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Pohitbureau on September 2,
1921. The-next day, September 3, Lenin wrote to the Secre-tary of the
Comintern Executive asking him to arrange for the collection of information
about workers’ donations in Europe for the relief of the famine-stricken
areas in Russia (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition,
Vol. 53, Document 270). For Soviet press reports on moneys collected among
the international proletariat see Document 345 of the same volume.

Comrade Molotov, 

Noulens is insolent to a degree. On the back of this sheet I propose a
draft decision. If there is no agreement on this among us I demand that the
whole Politbureau be convened tomorrow; I shall come down then. There can
be no question of yielding here. 

Lenin


4/IX. 

I propose this text of a Politbureau decision: 

“Chicherin shall be instructed to draw up in reply to
Noulens a sharply worded note of refusal in the form of a proclamation
against the bourgeoisie and imperialism with

    

special emphasis on the counter-revolutionary role of Noulens himself, with
special mention of the cynically insolent nature of the proposal, before
any agreement is reached, to send a commission of spies under the name of a
commission of experts, specially ridiculing the idea of sending the
commission question forms regarding winter crops by 4.IX., which we have
already done ourselves on time, and specially ridiculing the 7 points and
declaring that we shall either have dealings with governments a la Germany,
or with persons—not those of the Noulens type, of course—on the basis
of previous and clearly defined agreements. Special stress is to be laid on
the fact that we cannot for a moment believe in the desire to help on the
part of Messrs. Noulens in view of such an approach to the matter as

theirs.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Under the pretence of rendering relief to the famine-stricken areas in
Russia the imperialists organised an “International Com-mission” headed
by Noulens, the former French Ambassador to Russia and one of the chief
organisers of counter-revolutionary plots and military intervention against
Soviet Russia. The com-mission was made up of former French, , nglish, and
Belgian diplo-mats and big foreign owners of enterprises that had been
nation-alised in Russia. On September 4, 1921, the Noulens Commission sent
a telegram to. the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs demanding that
thirty experts be admitted into Soviet Russia for on-the-spot
investigations under a special programme pro-viding for the collection of
information of an intelligence nature. 

On September 6 the Politbureau approved, with slight
amendments, the text of a Note to Noulens drafted in accordance with
Lenin’s proposals. The answering Note of the Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs, published in Izvestia on September 8, stated that “Mr. Noulens’
Commission, in lieu of relief for the famine- stricken areas, planned to
collect information on the internal position of Soviet Russia ... and this
was to be done under the guidance of people who had already engaged in such
a study with the undisguised aim of engineering revolts and facilitating
the advance of foreign armies on the territory of theU.S.S.R.”
(U.S.S.R. Foreign Policy Documents, Vol. IV, Moscow, 1960). The Soviet
Government emphatically refused to permit entry of the Noulens Commission
into the Soviet Republic.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Owing to food difficulties, the crop failure and the need for
ren-dering relief to the famine-stricken areas, the Politbureau, on
September 6, 1921. adopted a decision on directives to the Food
Commissariat with Lenin’s amendments. The directives provided for a
reduction in the number of recipients of state food supplies as from
October 1921, and the establishment of a grain fund.

I move that the Politbureau resolve: 

To ask the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee: 

1) To revoke the decision of the C.P.C. assigning 5¼
millions for orders to the firm of Armstrong.  

2) To suspend the 10.9 million order for tank-cars, and
instruct Kursky within a week to check this expenditure for conformity with
all previous decisions of the Politbureau pertaining to the gold fund. 

3) To instruct Kursky to carry out a similar check in
regard to all allocations from the gold fund as from August 1921. 

4) To instruct Alsky to devise a proper form of special
accountancy covering spendings from the gold fund and special verification
of each item of expenditure from the point of view of the decisions of the
Politbureau (in co-operation with Molotov). 

5) To instruct Kursky to personally ascertain from the
documents whether allocations for Armstrong orders have been started, and
if they have, what the legal position will be in connection with the
annulment of the C.P.C.’s decision and the suspension of their
fulfilment.

Comrade Molotov, 

From all sides I hear that recommendations (in connection with the
Party

purge[1]) are being given right and left as a favour. 
 

I propose that a circular be published by the C.C. (by arrangement with
and over the signatures of the Central Control Commission and the
Verification Commission): 

“Recommendations may be given only by those who have personally
observed the work of the person recommend-ed for at least one year, and
have worked together with him in one or another Party

organisation.”[2] 

15/IX.


Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Party purge was carried out in compliance with the resolu-tion of
the Tenth Congress  of the R.C.P.(B.) “On Problems of Party
Developmept—it was preceded by long and careful preparation. On June 21,
1921, the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission adopted a
Decision on Checking, Revising and Purging the Party (see Pravda 
No. 146 for June 30, 1921), which fixed the date for the purge to be
carried out (from August 1 to October ii, 1921), stipulated that working
people, both Communists and non-Party, were to be questioned concerning
members of the Party who were being checked, and defined the procedure for
setting up local verification commissions. During the period of the purge
admission into the Party was suspended, an exception being made in the case
of workers and peasants who did not exploit outside labour. On July 7 the
Politburean endorsed a Central Verification Commission for checking the
Party membership and local verification commissions. The Central Committee
of the Party addressed a letter “To All Party Organisations. On the
Purging of the Party” (see Pravda No. 163 for July 27, 1921) setting
forth the aims and methods of the purge. The C.C. recommended the following
guidelines: a more indulgent attitude towards workers in the matter of
pre-santing documents, testimonials, etc. Asregards peasants, a clean 
line should be drawn between kulak and proprietary elements and honest
working peasants. A stricter approach to “commis-sarifled” elements, to
those holding posts which involve any priv-ileges. An especially strict
check to be applied to former govern-ment officials and bourgeois
intellectuals. And strictest of all to former members of other parties,
per., the Mcnsheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The start of the purge
was put off until August 15. 

As a result of the purge, which continued up till the
Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) about 25 per cent of the membership
were expelled from the Party. This improved the Party’s social composition,
strengthened discipline, gave the Party greater prestige among the
non-Party worker and peasant masses and freed the Party from elements who
discredited it. The Party’s ideological and organisational unity was
enhanced. 



[2]
This directive of Lenin’s was incorporated in the C.C.’s decisions.
The “Report of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.” for September 1921
states that the C.C. passed two decisions concerning the procedure for
recommending members of the R.C.P. during the purge. One stated: “Only
those comrades have the right to recommend who have known the recommended
person not less than one year and have worked with him or observed his work
in one or another Party organisation”. The other decision spoke about the
responsibility of the recommenders for the recommended (see Izvestia of
the C.C., R.C.P.  No. 35, December 1, 1921).

Comrade Kuibyshev, 

I am sending you the draft of an undertaking which Rutgers and
all his people down to each individual worker have to give (in
the event of an agreement being signed). 

If you are agreeable, put it to them. 

Find a reliable interpreter (for all negotiations) who knows
both languages well. 

An agreement is essential, and it must be very precisely worded. 

We must get our own lawyer (a Communist) to draw it up. 

I suggest it be called an agreement for handing over the
management of a number of factories, etc. 

The technical examination results should be signed by Stunkel
and several other experts of repute. 

With communist greetings,


Lenin 

Do the leaders aid organisers of the enterprise agree to sign the
following engagement and obtain the signatures of all the other people
going to Russia from America: 
 

1. We undertake to see to it and collectively answer for it
that only such people shall go to Russia as are capable and willing to face
a number of severe hardships involved in the rehabilitation of industry in
a very backward and utterly ruined country. 

2. Those going to Russia undertake to work their hardest and with the
greatest efficiency and discipline exceeding those of capitalist standards,
as otherwise Russia will not be able to outstrip capitalism or even catch
up with it. 

3. We undertake, in the event of any conflicts whatsoever to submit
them for settlement to the supreme Soviet authority of Russia and
faithfully abide by its decisions. 

4. We undertake not to forget the extremely nervous state of the
starving and exhausted Russian workers and peasants involved in our
business and to render them every assistance with a view to establishing
friendly relations and overcoming any distrust or envy. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In 1921 various groups of American workers united around the Society
for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia expressed a desire to go to Soviet
Russia to lend a hand in economic construction. Most of these workers were
Russian emigrants who had gone to America before the October
Revolution. 

On June 22, 1921, the Council of Labour and Defence
discussed the question of enlisting the services of members of the
industrial emigrant community, and recognised the desirability of
“developing individual industrial enterprises or groups of enterprises by
handing them over to groups of American workers and industrially developed
farmers on a contract basis ensuring them a definite degree of economic
autonomy” (Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 202). The Council also considered
it necessary to regulate industrial immigration of workers from foreign
countries. On August 11, 1921, a telegram signed by Lenin was sent to the
Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, stating, among other things:
“You must bear in mind the hardships existing in Russia, the difficulties
in connection with the food supply problem, and other obstacles which would
have to be faced. Persons going to Russia should be prepared to meet these
conditions  .... It would be best to send delegates first for an
on-the-spot inspection of settlement land lots, wood lots, mines,
factories, etc. to be leased” (U.S.S.R. Foreign Policy Documents, Vol. IV,
Moscow, 1960, p. 261). 

In the latter part of 1921 a group of American workers
headed by S. Rutgers,, a Dutch engineer and Communist, W. D. Heywood, a
prominent leader of the American labour movement and G. S. Calvert, an
American worker, carried on negotiations with the Soviet Government for
exploitation by this group of a part of the Kuznetsk coal-field in Siberia
and the organisation there of an industrial colony. Lenin received
delegates of the American workers’ colony on September 19 and had a talk
with them. A record of this talk, made by Lenin, is given in Lenin
Miscellany XX III , p. 39. Lenin’s draft engagement was written in
connection with this talk. For details concerning the agreement with the
sponsor group of the American workers (Rutgers group) see pp. 348-50 of
this volume.

I move that we agree with Chicherin and authorise him to
draw up precise and brief directives concerning the Far Eastern
Republic in the form of a draft

resolution.[1] 

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter to the Politbureau dated October 7, 1921, G. V. Chicherin,
Peolpe’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, wrote that the Government of the
Far Eastern Republic wished to be briefed by the Politbureau on the
following points: 1) Is recognition of the F.-E.R. by Japan and America
desirable in the absence of simultaneous recognition by them of the
R.S.F.S.R.; 2) Should the offer by foreigners to grant state loans to the
F.-E.R. be accepted; 3) Is the F.-E.R. independent of the R.S.F.S.R. in
fact as well as in form. In the opinion of the Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs these questions were to be answered in the following manner: 1)
Recognition of the F.-E.R. is desirable, but without the structure of the
F.-E.R. being specified in the agreement; 2) Foreign loans are useful
provided the sovereign rights of the F.-E.R. are preserved; 3) The
F.-E.R. is to be considered independent of the R.S.F.S.R. only inform. 

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on
October 8, 1921. 

The draft directives to the F.-E.R. proposed by
Chicherin were endorsed by the Politbureau on October 10, 1921.

Directives

of the Politbureau on the allotment of lands in the Ukraine
to the refineries for sugar-beet cultivation and on the compliance of the
peasants on the lands adjoining the sugar refineries with compulsory crop
rotation and fixed norms of culture. 

1. This reform is to be carried out with the greatest care,
no single step to be taken without practical verification that the business
of beet cultivation is adequately provided for by a rational system of
farming and by the peasant’s own personal interest in the matter. 

2. 400,000 dessiatines to be allotted to the refineries,
this figure to be checked as to whether it is really necessary for ensuring
properly organised large-scale factory farming. 

The refineries to be made responsible for all the land
allotted to them being rationally cultivated and utilised for the
plants. 

3. Compulsory crop rotation to be introduced on the peasant
lands and obligatory norms of culture to be applied

    

to them only in those cases where beet crops have long been cultivated on
these lands. 

4. Strict care should be taken that the relations between
the sugar refineries and the beet-cultivating peasants are based on a
really voluntary agreement within the limits of an obligatory fixed
beet-sowing area. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s draft directives were adopted by the Politbureau on October 10,
1921, following the report of C. G. Rakovsky, V. Y. Chubar and
G. I. Petrovsky. “On this question a general orientation was given,”
stated the C.C. Report for OctoberNovember 1921, “in the sense of a more
careful and attentive attitude being shown towards the needs of the
peasants and securing their co-operation with the state” (Izvestia of
the Central >Committee, R.C.P.(B.) No. 36 for December 15, 1921).

12. X. 1921 

Comrade Molotov, 

I enclose material on the Rutgers business. 

It is for the Council of Labour and Defence to decide. 

I suggest that it first be decided in the C.C.—it is a political
question. And the Politbureau must have its say, as it is a gold
spending. 
 

Please get the secretary to telephone all the members of the
Politbureau who will each arrange for one hour in the course of
which he will be able to familiarise himself with the material before
Friday. Each one must look through it so that it can be settled on
Friday. 

Let the secretary make up a time-table and send the material round to
each member of the Politbureau.

  

  



A difficult question: 

for: if the Americans keep their word, it
will be of tremendous benefit. In that case we shall not grudge


600,000 gold rubles.

  

  



against: will they keep their word? Heywood is
half-anarchist.  More sentimental than business-like. Rutgers may
succumb to Leftism. Calvert is highly garrulous. We have no
business guarantees whatever. Enthusiastic people, in an atmosphere of
unemployment, may recruit a group of “adventurous spirits” who will end
up in squabbles. We may then lose part of our 600,000 gold rubles
(they will, of course, spoil and waste some of the property) and risk
losing up to 1 million gold rubles

more, because under § 8 (the end of it) we undertake 

“to reimburse the equivalent of expenditures on machines and tools
brought in by the said emigrant”.

  

  



No small risk. 

For: Smirnov I. N. and Maximov (of the Urals) are local people, and
they are for it. 

Against: Martens should know the Americans well, and he is
against. 

Lenin 

Please arrange for all the members of the S.E.C. Presidium to be on
phone call with the secretary of the C.C. on Friday from 12 to 4 p.m. in
case they are called out to the C.C.

  

  



P.S. Please also send copies of this letter to all the members of the
Politbureau. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was written in preparation for the meeting of the
Pelitbureau on the question of an agreement with the group of American
workers and engineers headed by S. Rutgers, who had arrived in Russia (see
Note 399). 

On September 23, 1921, the C.L.D. discussed the
proposal of the Rutgers group for the Nadezhdinsk Works and a number of
enterprises of the Kuznetsk coal-field to be turned over to them for
exploitation, and found it desirable to conclude an agreement, the final
terms of which were to be drafted by a commission consisting of
representatives of the S.E.C., the Commissariat for Labour and the
Commissariat for Agriculture. Lenin took part in the negotiations with the
Rutgers group and made a number of proposals in connection with the terms
of the agreement (see pp. 348-50, 652-53 of this volume, and Collected
Works, Vol.  53, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 260-61, 302-03). 

The agreement with the sponsor group (the Rutgers
group) of the American workers, which was signed on October 20, was
endorsed by the C.L.D., on October 21 and by the C.P.C. on October 25. In
November the Soviet Government signed a contract with this group, under
which the American workers were to bring with them a definite quantity of
tools, materials and foodstuffs, while the Soviet Government assigned a sum
of $300,000 for the purchase abroad of machines and equipment. Under the
terms of this contract an Autonomous Industrial Colony directly
subordinated to the C.L.D. was set up in part of the territory of the
Kuznetsk coal-field.

In my opinion, Rutgers’ proposals cannot be accepted now in
their present form. But I should like to try a thing like this: to make him
modify the group (Rutgers + Heywood + Calvert). And modify the
financial terms, too. We could decide this way: 

while rejecting the proposals of Comrade Rutgers in
their present form, i.e., the motion of Comrade Bogdanov and the members of
the S.E.C. Presidium who voted with him, 

the C.C. (and then the C.L.D. in
administrative order) expresses an earnest wish that Comrade Rutgers’ group
should not regard this refusal as a final one and should revise their
proposals on the following lines:

α) modification of the group, the main group of sponsors, by adding
to it 5-8 prominent representatives of the American labour union movement
or other labour organisations;

β) reducing our Government’s expenses to the sum of $300,000 maximum;



’) cutting and specifying our expenses in the event of the agreement being

cancelled.[1] 

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s proposals formed the basis of the Politbureau’s decision of
October 15, 1921, concerning the proposals of S. Rutgers, and the Council
of Labour and Defence decision of October 17, 1921, “On the Terms of an
Agreement with the Rutgers Group”.

Confirm the decision of the Orgbureau; point out once more
the absolutely wrong behaviour of Comrade Shlyapnikov, who declared in the
Orgbureau that he would not

    

comply; inquire of the Central Verification Commission and the Central
Control Commission for how long they consider it possible to release
Comrade Shlyapnikov for food supply work without detriment to the work of
the Central Verification Commission. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s draft was adopted at the meeting of the Politbureau on October
14, 1921. After hearing the opinion of the Central Control Commission and
the Central Verification Commission on the question of assigning
Shlyapnikov to feed supply work, the Politbureau ruled on October 27: “The
period of Comrade Shlyapnikov’s work on food supply should be fixed at two
months, counting from the date of his departure” (Central Party Archives,
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.).


The Central Verification Commission,  consisting of five
members, was set up for the period of the Party purge to direct the work of
the local verification commissions (see Pravda  No. 146, June 30,
1921).

1) Guseinov and Akhundov to be called out
immediately. 

2) It be strictly demanded that factional strife in Baku
and Azerbaijan cease completely. 

3) It be confirmed that those engaging in factional strife
will be expelled from the Party. 

4) The comrades sent to Azerbaijan from the
R.S.F,S.R. shall be directed to check fulfilment. 

5) Stalin shall be instructed to draw up by Monday draft
directives on the implementation of the Communist Party’s national policy
in Azerbaijan. 

6) In regard to Persia the strictest confirmation to be
made at once. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
There having been certain differences of opinion among leading members
of the Baku Party organisation and the central organisations of Azerbaijan
in applying the national policy, the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)
issued instructions for the greatest discretion to be shown by Party
workers in Azerbaijan towards the mode of life and way of thinking among
the Moslem population. All functionaries of the Azerbaijan Communist Party
were directed to take this into consideration in all their activities and
strive towards teamwork and co-operation and not allow any factions to be
formed within the Party organisation. Lenin’s proposals were included in
the decision of the C.C.’s Politbureau adopted October 15, 1921. 

The directives on the implementation of the Communist
Party’s ntiona1 policy in Azerbaijan drafted by S. V. Stalin were endorsed
by the Politbureau on October 17. 

Point 6 refers to the decision of the Politbureau of
October 3, 1921, aimed at preventing any violation by Baku Party workers of
the Soviet Governmeiit’s policy towards Persia (Iran).

Comrade Mikhailov, 

I enclose the reply of the Rutgers group to the decision of the Council
of Labour and Defence (i.e., the decision of the Central Committee). 

I believe this is tantamount to an acceptance of our
terms. 

I am therefore enclosing a draft decision for the C.C. which
please circulate as quickly as possible among the members of the
Politbureau.

Very urgent, 

With communist greetings, Lenin 

In view of the fact that the group of sponsors (Comrades Rutgers,
Heywood and Calvert) have accepted the terms proposed in the decision of
the C.L.D. of 17.X., the Central Committee resolves and directs
the C.L.D. to resolve: 

The C.L,D. resolves: 

1) that the agreement with the group be considered concluded;


2) that Comrade Bogdanov be directed to immediately draw up and submit
to the chairman of the C.L,D. for signature telegrams giving the
most urgent orders for laying in stocks of wood, timber, etc.; 
 

3) that the Presidium of the S.E.C. be directed within two days to draw
up the final text of a modified agreement for endorsement by the C.L.D. on
Friday, 21.X.1921; 

4) that $5,000 be issued to Comrade Rutgers on Saturday, 22.X.,
according to the agreement, immediately after its endorsement by the
C.L.D. on 21.X. 

Further, without this being recorded as a decision of the C. L. D., the
C.C. instructs Comrade Bogdanov, the Kuibyshev Commission, and the
C.L.D. to modify the agreement in such a way that (1) the C.L.D.
shall have the right to take part in the selection of extra candidates for
the “Organising Committee” before and for the purpose of the
final endorsement of this list; (2) the total sum of all the Soviet
government’s expenses shall not exceed $300,000; (3) in the event
of. the agreement being cancelled the Soviet authorities shall not
incur any financial liabilities (or only such as shall be recognised as
lawful by a court of the R.S.F.S.R. or by the Central Executive
Committee of the R. S. F. S. R.) 

Lenin

Lenin’s draft was adopted by the Politbureau on October 20’ 1921. His
proposals were incorporated in the agreement concluded with the Rutgers
group.

I agree. 19/X Lenin 

(even if the aim is trade, we should make this
experiment, as we are given a clear profit for the famine-stricken and the
right of control; and the right of cancellation at 3 months’ notice. Hence
we should not charge for carriage and storage). A controller of ours
(confirmed by the Politbureau) shall be appointed to the A.R.A. who
combines reliability with an ability to control the w h o l e
operation. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The A. R.A. (American Relief Administration) -was formed in
1919 to render relief to the population who had suffered from the First
World War. The President of the A.B.A. NN-as Herbert Hoover, a big
capitalist, who had had close links with Russian capital before 1917. Some
of the A.B.A. staff engaged ’iii charitable work with all sincerity and
cojiscieiitiousiiess, but the A.R.A. asa whole served as an instrument for
spreading the influence of American imperialism and dumping old
stocks. 

On October 18, 1921, the draft of an agreement with the
A.R.A. on the organisation of food parcels to Russia was circulated for
voting among members of the Politbureau. The covering letter has the
signatures of Politbureau members and a proposal by Stalin that a charge be
made for transportation of the parcels from the frontier to the
distributing warc’liouses, and for their storage, since, in his opijiion,
this was a commercial operation, not charity. Lenin’s bracketed remark was
made in connection with this proposal. The draft agreement with the
A.R.A. was endorsed by the Politbureau on October 19, 1921. 

The Soviet Government accepted A.R.A. assistance in
con-nection with famine on the Volga and in south Ukraine in 1921, but
repelled its attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet
Republic and established control over its activities. As subsequent events
roved, the A.R.A. personnel, consisting, chiefly of American army
officers, engaged in espionage and supported counter-revolutionary
elements. The A. B .A. ceased its activities in the U.S.S.R. in June
1923.

19.X.1921 

Dear Comrades, 

Judging by the scrappy information concerning the growth of the
communist movement in Poland that reaches our newspapers, and judging
(still more) by the reports of some very prominent Polish comrades, the
revolution in Poland is coming to a head. 
A workers’ revolution is brewing: the complete collapse of the

P.P.S.[the Polish Socialist Party] (in
Russian-S.H.s and Mensheviks; in European-the II and 11’. /2 The trade
unions, one after another, are joining the Communists.  The growth of
demonstrations, and so on. Imminent and inevitable financial collapse. The
gigantic failure of bourgeois democracy (and of the petty bourgeoisie) in
Poland with the agrarian reform, a failure that is foredoomed, inevitable,
and bound to push the majority of the rural population-the whole poor
section of the peasantry-towards the Communists. 

Financial collapse and shameless plunder of Poland by Entente capital
(France and other countries) are bringing with them a practical exposure of
national and Great Power illusions, an exposure that is strikingly clear
and tangible to the masses, to the rank-and-file worker, to the
rank-and-file peasant. 

If this is so, then the revolution (Soviet revolution) in Poland is
bound to win, and win soon. That being the case, the Government
and the bourgeoisie must be prevented from strangling the revolution by
bloody suppression of a premature uprising. You must not be
provoked. You must wait for the tide to rise to its highest: it will sweep
everything away and give victory to the Communists. 

If the bourgeoisie kills 100-300 people, this will not ruin the
cause. But if it is able to provoke a massacre, to kill 10-30
thousand workers, this may delay the revolution even for several
years. 

If it is important for the Government to hold elections to the Seim,
then an effort should be made for the Seim to

    

be won by the wave of the workers’ revolution and the peasants’
discontent. 

Do not yield to provocation. 

The revolution must be allowed to grow to full ripening of the
fruit. The victory of Soviet power from within Poland will be a
gigantic international victory. If Soviet power has, in my
opinion, now won an international victory to the extent of 20-30 per cent,
then with the victory of Soviet power from within Poland, we shall
have a 40-50, perhaps even 51 per cent international victory of
the communist revolution. For Poland is next door to Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and a Soviet Poland will under-mine the
whole regime built up on the peace of Versailles. 

That is why the Polish Communists bear a responsibility before the
whole world-that of keeping a firm grip on the helm of their ship and
steering clear of provocations. 

Is it worth while retaliating for the beating up of D&awhatthebal by Daszynski
& Co.? Retaliation, if any, should be by beating up Daszynski, just
like that, without any shooting or wounding. It may be worth while if it
has the effect of teaching an insolent fellow a lesson at the hands of the
workers, and stiffening the workers’ spirit at the cost of a sacrifice of
5-10 of them (by imprisonment or execution). But maybe it is not worth
while: would not the fact that our D&awhatthebal had been brutally beaten up be
more useful for the purpose of agitation among the peasants?
Would it not be more effective in turning the sympathy of the
backward peasants towards us than the thrashing of Daszynski? This
should be weighed more carefully. 

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Re § 4: 

The People’s Commissariat for Finance and the Finance
Commission, as well as all comrades handling questions of home trade, shall
be directed to select within the shortest

    

possible time a group of people with long practical experience in
capitalist trade for the purpose of consultation on currency
questions. These comrades shall be asked, within two days, to report in
writing whether they can fulfil this assignment and in what period of
time. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was written by Lenin for the meeting of the Politbureau of
October 20, 1921, which had before it the request of the People’s
Commissariat for Finance that representatives of the Corn-missariat be
included intheC.L.D. and the regional and gubernia economic conferences
with a right to vote. The Politbureau rejected this request and adopted
Lenin’s motion. The last sen-tence in the manuscript is crossed out and was
not included in the decision. 

A Finance Commission of the Central Committee,
R,C.P.(B.) and the Council of People’s Commissars was set up on
Lenin’s proposal soon after the Tenth Congress of the Party for dealing
with questions of financial policy in the light of the New Economic Policy.

the part of the three-man commission and other institutions. 

Its report to be presented to the C.L.D. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of manufacturing Fowler-type motor ploughs was considered
repeatedly by the Council of Labour and Defence. The Metal Department of
the Supreme Economic Council, which had been charged with the manufacture
of these ploughs in May 1920, drew up a production plan without taking into
account available metal and fuel resources. The Special Three-Man
Commission set up to combine all production of ploughs did not inform the
C.L.D. or the C.P.C. as to the actual state of affairs. 

This draft decision was adopted at the meeting of the
C.L.D. on October 21, 1921. The case of red tape was brought before the
Moscow Military Tribunal, which found a number of members of the staffs of
the S.E.C. and the Commissariat for Agri-culture guilty of
negligence. Considering these men’s services in the matter of economic
reconstruction, however, the Tribunal decided not to punish them. At the
suggestion of the Moscow Military Tribunal the C.L.D. reprimanded the
Presidium of the S.E.C. and the Board of the Commissariat for Agriculture
for giving insufficient attention to the production of Fowler ploughs. See
Lenin’s letter to P. A. Bogdanov dated December 23, 1921 (present edition,
Vol. 36, pp. 556-58).

A commission consisting of comrades Gorbunov, Smolyaninov,
Avanesov (with the right of replacement) and Krumin and with the
co-operation of the Central Statistical

    

Board, the State Planning Commission and the appropriate departments, shall
be directed to submit to the C.L.D. within one week the draft of a decision
calling for all departments to present statistical data and diagrams
monthly to the C.L.D. pertaining especially to economic activities, their
analysis, working up and formulation of practical conclusions. 

Comrade Gorbunov or Smolyaninov to be charged with summoning the
commission and reporting to the

C.L.D.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Following the endorsement by the Presidium of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee on June 30, 1921, of the “Instruc-tions of the Council
of Labour and Defence to Local Soviet Bodies” (see present edition,
Vol. 32, pp. 375-98) Lenin wrote a letter to the editors of Izvestia,
Pravda, Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn and other newspapers on July 21 pointing
out the importance of “explaining in detail the significance which the
local economic conferences and the publication of reports for general
informa-tion has for both the application of the New Economic Policy in
general and for proper economic construction” (Collected Works,
Vol. 53, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 52). 

When reports started coming in from the local areas,
Lenin raised the question of studying and utilising these reports. On
October 21, 1921, Lenin made a report at the C.L.D. on the subject of
reports and diagrams for the C.L.D. and tabled the draft decision as given
here. 



[2]
V. A. Smolyaninov, in his reminiscences, says that the work of the
commission dragged out. “Vladimir Ilyich showed a great interest in the
results of our commission’s work. On his advice and suggestion a draft
decision was drawn up, which was en- dorsed by the Council of Labour and
Defence on November 21, 1921. This decision took into account all Lenin’s
remarks. He attached special importance to having people appointed in the
various commissariats and other institutions who were really interested in
and understood the importance of studying the local reports”
(Vospomtnaniya o Viadimire Ilyiche Lenine [Remi- niscences of
Lenin], Part 3, Moscow, 1961, p. 367). Lenin’s private library contains
several dozen reports of gubernia economic conferences.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The draft of a financial plan and of a plan of emission for 1922 was
down for discussion at the meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on
November 5, 1921. Lenin’s motion formed the basis of the decision passed by
the Council on this question. Points 2, 4, 5 and 6 are crossed out in the
manuscript and were not included in the decision.  



[2]
Lenin’s draft was incorporated in the text of the Council’s decision on
this question adopted on November 18, 1921. The Council endorsed
“tentatively the budgetary appropriations and their distribution among the
commissariats as submitted by the Finance Commission” and directed the
commissariats “to speed up the work of making up estimates, which should
be completed by December 1”. The Finance Commission and the State Planning
Commission were charged with “completing the calculation of revenues, both
monetary and material, within one week” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.).

   1st question of the Mongolian delegation: “Comrade Lenin, what do you
   think about the establishment of a People’s Revolutionary Party in our
   country and what is most important for us?’ 


Comrade Lenin outlined to our delegation our country’s international
situation and pointed out that owing to the M.P.R.’s geographical position
the imperialist powers, in case of war, would try to seize our country and
use it as a jumping-off ground for military operations against another
country. Therefore, Lenin said, the only right way for every working person
in your country was to fight for state and economic independence in
alliance with the workers and peasants of Soviet Russia. This fight could
not be carried on isolatedly, therefore the establishment of a party of
Mongolian arats was a pledge of success in their struggle. 


The Mongolian delegation’s second question: “Will the national
   liberation struggle be victorious?” 


Comrade Lenin’s answer: 

“I have been in the revolutionary movement myself for
thirty years and I know by experience how difficult it is for any people to
liberate themselves from their external and internal enslavers. Although
Mongolia is a cattle-breeding country and the bulk of her population are
nomad herdsmen, she has achieved great progress in her revolution, and most
important of all, has made good these successes by creating a People’s
Revolutionary Party of her own, whose aim is to become a mass party
uncluttered by alien elements.” 


The Mongolian delegation’s third question: “Ought not the People’s
   Revolutionary Party be transformed into a Communist Party?” 

 

Comrade Lenin’s reply: 

“I should not recommend it, because one party cannot be
‘transformed’ into another.” Comrade Lenin explained the essence of a
Communist Party as a party of the proletariat, and said: “The
revolutionaries will have to put in a good deal of work in developing
state, economic and cultural activities before the herdsman elements become
a proletarian mass, which may eventually help to ‘transform’ the People’s
Revolutionary Party into a Communist Party. A mere change of signboards is
harmful and dangerous.” 

Comrade Lenin elaborated on the idea that it was possible and necessary
for the M.P.R. to follow a non-capitalist path of development, the main
condition for which was hard work on the part of the People’s Revolutionary
Party and the Government, so that this work and the increased influence of
the Party and the authorities would result in a growth of the number of
co-operatives, in the introduction of new forms of economic activity and
national culture, and would rally the arats behind the Party and the
Government in the interests of the country’s economic and cultural
development. It was only from the islets of the new economic way of life
created by the efforts of the Party and the Government that the new
non-capitalist economic system of arat Mongolia would take shape. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The delegation of the Mongolian People’s Republic arrived in Moscow on
November 2, 1921. Its members were: Danzan, head of the delegation,
Minister for Finance and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Mongolian
People’s Revolutionary Party; Sukhe-Bator, Commander-in-Chief of the
People’s Revolutionary Army and War Minister; B. Tserendorzh, Deputy
Mirister for Foreign Affairs; Djon-Van-Shirnin-Dandin, representative of
religious circles, unofficial member of the delegation; Batukhan, adviser
and head interpreter. The object of the negotiations was to conclude an
agreement between the Government of the R.S.F.S.R. and the People’s
Government of Mongolia. The draft agreement was considered and approved by
the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars on November 3, 1921 (see
Collected Works, Vol. 53, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 324). On
November 5, 1921, an agreement was signed by representatives of
the R.S.F.S.R. and the M.P.R. under which both parties engaged not to allow
groups hostile to the other party to stay or be formed on their
territories, and made arrangements for the appointment of diplomatic and
consular representatives, the fixing of state boundaries, and customs
arrangements. The Soviet Government handed over to the Government of the
M.P.R. telegraph instalations in Mongolia belonging to the R.S.F.S.R. 

Lenin’s talk with the delegation took place in the
Kremlin. A report of the talk was first published in the minutes of the
Ninth Congress of the M.P.R.P., which was held from September 28 to October
5, 1934. The publication was reproduced from the reminiscences of B,
Shumyatsky and B. Tserendorzh. The latter wrote in his recollections:
“Lenin spoke for a long time with the members of the delegation. He lent
an attentive ear to our stories, showed a lively interest in the most
varied aspects of life in people’s Mongolia, and gave some useful
advice. In particular, he drew our attention to the need for raising the
level of education and culture among the Mongolian people, while at the
same time stressing the need for developing the country’s economy to the
utmost with a view to meeting all the requirements of the peopi.”

It shall be recognised that the resolution of the First
All-Russia Conference on the cultural and educational work of the trade
unions is at variance with the resolution of the Tenth Congress of the
R.C.P. on the Chief Committee for Political Education and its relations
with the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions

(§ 2).[1] 
 

The resolution of the Congress of Gubernia Political Education

Departments[2] shall be confirmed as a whole and the Chief Committee
for Political Education shall be directed, within a month and in agreement
with the A.G.C.T.U. to draw up detailed practical instructions giving
concrete definitions of the forms of “joint” work by both institutions
and the forms in which the trade unions and their bodies are to “use” the
“apparatus and staff” of the Chief Committee for Political

Education.[3] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The First All-Russia Conference on Trade Union Cultural and
Educational Work was held in Moscow from September 26 to October 1,
1921. It was attended by 173 delegates (122 voting delegates and
51 with a consultative voice), of whom 419 were Communists, 51
non-Party people, 1 Menslievik, I Socialist-Revolutionary and I inter-party
socialist. There were 13 items on the agenda of the conference, which
included reports of the A.C.C.T.U.’s Culture Department, the Peoples’
Commissariat for Education and its chief administrations, and Proletcult;
reports from the local areas (Donbas, Petrograd, Baku); the New Economic
Policy and education; the trade union’s work of polit-ical education;
cultural work among the youth, and other items. The conference mapped out
ways for improving the trade unions’ work of political education, and new
forms and methods under the New Economic Policy (cultural work at private
and leased enterprises, and so on). 

The conference adopted a wrong stand on the question of
relations with the Chief Committee for Political Education. Its resolution
(“Role and Aims of the Trade Unions’ Cultural Work”) contained a demand
that the trade unions’ cultural work should be freed from the influence of
the Chief Committee for Political Education. This ran counter to the
resolution of the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. “On the Chief Committee for
Political Educa-tion and the Agitation and Propaganda Tasks of the Party”
(see The C.P.S, U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses,
Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part 1,
1954, p. 550). 



[2]
Lenin is referring to the resolution of the Second All-Russia Congress
of Political Education Departments (held from October 17 to 22, 1921) “On
the Reports of the Chief Committee for Political Education”, which defined
the relations between the political education departments and the trade
unions’ culture departments centrally and locally. “The trade unions,”
ran this resolution, “constantly lapse into the entirely erroneous view
that educational work in all forms should be the business of the trade
unions, that the trade unions would be better able to conduct the business
of education than the educational authorities. 

”Their point of view is erroneous and. stems from
misinter-pretation of the tasks of the trade unions. Adherence to such a
point of view would induce the conclusion that all state functions, the
work of all the commissariats, should be turned over to the trade unions”
(Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education
Departments. Congress Bulletin No. 7, October 24, 1921). 

The resolution of the congress mapped out concrete
measures for the joint ideological, political, cultural and educational
work of the Chief Committee for Political Education and the Culture
Department of the A.C.C.T.U.  



[3]
The Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) decided on November 8, 1921, to
adopt as a basis Lenin’s resolution. In accordance with this decision
regulations were drafted for the joint political education work of the
A.C.C.T.U.’s Culture Department and the Chief Committee for Political
Education.

Comrade Mikhailov, 

Please have this sent round to the members of the Pout-bureau. 

My personal opinion is that the whole of V. Milyutin’s plan should be
rejected as being worthless and absolutely unconsidered. 

I propose it be rejected. 

Lenin 

9/XI. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note was written on Chicherin’s letter to the Politbureau in which
he reported that the question of denationalising Soviet Russia’s foreign
trade was raised at the Baltic Economic Conference (held at Riga, from
October 28 to 31, 1921). V. P. Milyutin, the head of the
R. S.F. S. B. delegation at the conference, submitted a paper on this
question which was sent to the Politbureau. Milyutin’s plan boiled down to
abolishing the monopoly of foreign trade. On November 10 the Politbureau,
on Lenin’s motion, rejected Milyutin’s proposal (see also Collected
Works, Vol. 44, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 427-30; present edition,
Vol. 33, pp. 375-78 and pp. 455-59).

Comrade Mikhailov, 

Please send this round to the members of the Politbureau
and return to me. 
 

I propose this decision for the Politbureau. 

The Politbureau impresses upon the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of the Ukraine that full, 100%, food collections in the Ukraine are
of absolutely paramount importance to the R.S.F.S.R. Similarly the delivery
to us of 57 million poods. Immediate and energetic measures are to be
worked out for achieving this aim and all decisions are to be
reported. 

Brief fortnightly reports by telephone are to be made on the progress
of food collection and delivery to the R.S.F.S.R.

The decree introducing payment for newspapers was endorsed by the

public institutions and organisations, and state institutions and
enterprises without exception were to be charged for newspapers. Lenin’s
motion formed the basis of Point 8 of the Decree, which directed the
People’s Commissariat for Education to draw up within a fortnight and
publish instructions covering control over the proper distribution of
newspapers to the network of educational institutions and the supply of
news- papers to the population (see Izvestia No. 275, December 7,
1921).

Viva voce voting

26.XI.1921

Comrade Molotov, 

Could you try to settle two questions in the Politbureau by telephone:


1) That Sokolnikov be appointed member of the Board of the
People’s Commissariat for Finance and member of the Finance Commission on
condition that he remains Chairman of the Turkestan
Bureau and is obliged to travel to Turkestan when necessary
until things there have been fully put in order. (If this does not get a
majority, I shall have to put the matter for consideration to the whole
Politbureau). 

2) Today we rejected my motion

offhand[1] and I agreed to withdraw it. But I now see that I was too
hasty and I renew it: 

That 1) Pyatakov; 2) Rukhimovich; 3) Bogdanov (or his deputy Smilga) be
directed to submit to the Politbureau within two weeks a plan (or
regulations or theses) of relations between the gubernia economic
conferences and the large enterprises located in the given gubernia and
subordinated directly to the centre in



Moscow.[2] 

[We ourselves cannot draft it. It is a universal question.


All the commissariats will have to be questioned. It must be
worked up quickly. Start with the Donets Gubernia Economic Conference.]


Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to his motion on the question of the disagreements
between the leading Party functionaries in the Donbas, which was discussed
at a meeting of the Politbureau.

Lenin’s motion on the first and second questions was adopted by the
Politbureau on November 27, 1921.

28/XI.

Comrade Tsyurupa, 

My plan has matured: 

In addition to the post of Deputy Chairman of the Council 

of Labour and Defence held by Rykov (with the right of casting vote in
the Council of People’s Commissars) the post of second deputy chairman of
the C.L.D. is instituted on equal terms. Tsyurupa is appointed to this post
and released from the Food Commissariat. 

The rights of these deputies: a casting vote in the C.P.C. and the
C,L.D.; the chairing of the meetings in the absence of the
chairman. All the rights of C.P.C. chairman as far as participation in all
boards and institutions is concerned, and (inter alia) the right to give
instructions in regard to the practical work (subject to immediate
execution) to People’s Commissars and to members of their boards,
etc. (with the knowledge and consent of the commissars of the government
departments concerned) on questions pertaining to the integration and
direction of the economic commissariats’ activities. 

That is how I conceive the official decision of the All Russia
Central Executive

Committee.[1] 

The task is to integrate and improve the economic work AS A
WHOLE, especially in connection with and through the State Bank
(trade) and the State Planning Commission. 

To make a first-hand study of the specific features and work
of all the economic commissariats and an acquaintance with all the
members of their boards and a number (10-100) of local and regional
top workers in this field. 

To personally attend important board meetings of the
respective commissariats, the State Planning Commission, the State Bank,
Centrosoyuz, etc. and check personally,

    

at the choice of the Deputy Chairmen of the C.L.D., those functions which
are considered most vital or of special topicality. 

For how long these posts will be, “we shall see”: perhaps 3-4 years,
perhaps 30 years. 

One of the objects is to develop a highly trained type of
instructor-inspector to check and organise all economic work at
all economic institutions centrally and locally. 

The deputy chairmen conduct their work through the apparatus
of the existing commissariats, having only the Managing Department of the
C.L.D. as their own body (4-5 C.L.D. business managers with 1-2 assistants
and 1-2 secretaries to each assistant). 

The business manager of the C.L.D., his assistants and secretaries form
the sole single staff of the C.L.D. as a whole and of
both its deputy chairmen. 

Let me have your reply not later than


WEDNESDAY.  Return this. 

With communist greetings, Lenin 

To members of the Politbureau: I have received A.D. Tsyurupa’s consent
to this tentative plan and ask all the members of the Politbureau
to read it. I want to put it before the Politbureau tomorrow, 1.XII. 

Lenin 

30.XI.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This part of Lenin’s letter was a draft for the Pclitbureau. The
latter’s decision, adopted on December 1, 1921, on Lenin’s report, stated
that “Comrade Tsyurupa shall be relieved of the post of People’s Commissar
for Food and appointed Second Deputy Chairman of the C.L.D with a casting
vote in the C.L.D. and the C.P.C., the appointment to be endorsed by the
Presidium of the A.C.E.C.” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.). A similar wording was used
in the decision of the A.C.E.C. confirming the appointment of
A. D. Tsyurupa to the post of Second Deputy Chairman of the C.L.D. (see
Izvestia No. 272, December 3, 1921).

Notes
 
 



[1]
In view of the country’s transition to peaceful economic construetion, Lenin proposed the reorganisation of thd Vecheka. On December 1, 1921, the Politbureau set up a commission consisting of L. B. Kamenev, D. I. Kursky and F. E. Dzerzhinsky to go into this question within five days with a view to: “a) narrowing the jurisdiction of the Vecheka; b) narrowing its right of arrest; c) fixing a term of one month for the whole process of the law; d) giving more weight to the courts of law; e) considering the question of a change of name; I) preparing and passing through the All-Russia C.E.C. general regulations covering changes in the direction of radical relaxations” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC. of the C.P.S.U.). 

Lenin’s ideas were embodied also in the Resolution on
the Vecheka passed by the Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on December
27, 1921. The congress directed the Presidium of the All-Russia
C. E. C. “to revise the Regulations on the Vecheka and its agencies in the
direction of its reorganisation, the iiarrowing of its jurisdiction and the
strengthening of the principles of revolutionary legality” (The Ninth
All-Russia Congress 0/ Soviets. Verbatim. Report, 1922, p. 300). On
January 23, 1922, the Politbureau examined the question of reorganising the
Vecheka into the State Political Administration (Gosudarstvennoye
Politicheskoye Upravleniye- G. P. U.) under the People’s Commissariat for
Internal Affairs and defined the basic tasks and functions of the G.P.U. On
February 6 the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. passed a decision for the
reorganisation of the Vecheka (see Izvestia No. 30, February 8,
1922). 

Point 3 of Lenin’s draft refers to the period in which
the reorganisation was to be carried out.

a) That the Line of joint action with the workers of the
Second International proposed by a number of Communist Parties of the
Communist International and introduced by Zinoviev, Radek and Bukharin be
approved. The latter to be directed within two days to set forth this line
clearly in a draft resolution to be circulated among the members of the
Politbureau. 

b) That Comrade Bukharin be directed to write and show the
Politbureau an article summing up the experience of the R,C.P. in the
Bolsheviks’ struggle against the Mensheviks and the blocs between

them.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This draft was written in connection with the discussion by the
Politbureau on December 1, 1921, of the question of the tactics of a united
workers’ front. Lenin’s proposals were adopted. They formed the basis of
the Comintern Executive’s theses “On the United Workers’ Front and the
Attitude to the Workers Belonging to the II, II/2 and Amsterdam
Internationals, as Well as the Workers Who Support the Anarcho-Syndicalist
Organisations”. Lenin’s remarks on the theses (see p. 368 of this volume)
were also taken into consideration. The theses were published in the
journal The Communist International No. 20 for 1921. The
Eleventh All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) (December 19-21,
1921) subscribed to these theses. They were discussed and endorsed by
the first enlarged plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive (February
21-March 4, 1922) and by the Fourth Congress of the
Comintern. 

Lenin’s “Notes on the History of the R.C.P.” (see
present edition, Vol. 36, pp. 552-54) were made in connection with the
proposal that Bukharin should write an article summing up the experience of
the R.C.P.(B.)

Comrade Zinoviev, 

I have read the rough draft of the theses and have no objections.  

The paragraph on the history of Bolshevism should be amplified and
partly modified. It is incorrect to say there was a split only in 1910. It
should be stated that the formal splits with the Mensheviks in the spring
of 1905 and in January 1912 alternated with the semi-unity and unity of
1906 and 1907 followed by that of 1910 not only because of the vicissitudes
of the struggle but also under pressure from the rank and file, who
demanded check tests through their own experience.  

I think this should be stated more explicitly and concretely on one

page.{1}

6/XII.

Dear Comrades, 

I heartily welcome your forthcoming publication. I am very sorry that
ill-health prevents me from contributing an article. I hope that the
business of attracting the best representatives of the working people of
the East will make faster and wider progress thanks to your newspaper. The
destiny of all Western civilisation now largely depends on drawing the
working masses of the East into political activities.  

With best wishes and greetings, 

Lenin


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars of the R.S.F.S.R.

With regard to Zalutsky’s draft resolution on the Party purge I would like
to make two remarks.


1) In section 3 §a Zalutsky proposes that enrolment into the Party
be suspended for 6 months. I think this is wrong. I would propose, on my
part, not to suspend enrolment, but to lay down stricter conditions,
namely: a long term of probation. If an eighteen-month term for real
workers is considered too long, it can be reduced, say, to nine, or even
six months, as Trotsky proposes. In the case of such short terms, however,
I think we should require a qualified

    

majority in the bodies making enrolment decisions, for instance, that it
should require a majority of not less than four-fifths to have the term of
enrolment reduced, this four-fifths majority to be demanded not only from
one Party body (the local cell making the admission), but from several
bodies for the sake of mutual control (for example, from the Gubernia Party
Committee in addition to the local cell, and so on). I would have nothing
whatever against admission into the Party being made easier for genuine
workers, but unless very strict conditions are laid down for determining
who is to be considered a worker of large industry, we shall immediately
find a mass of riff-raff crawling through the hole again. As regards Red
Armymen, I think we should have stricter conditions, since, for one thing,
most of them are not workers, but peasants, and secondly, these people are
too young and need testing.

2) In Section 4 §a Zalutsky proposes a revision of the plans of
work among the Young Communist League. I believe stricter conditions should
be laid down on this point to make sure that the members of the
Y.C.L. admitted to member ship of the Party have, first, really studied
seriously and learnt something, and secondly, that they have a long record
of serious practical work (economic, cultural,

etc.).[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s remarks on the draft resolution for the Eleventh Conference of
the R.C.P.(B.) on the Party purge were taken into consideration by the
drafting committee.  

The conference discussed the results of the Party purge and adopted a
resolution “On the Question of Strengthening the Party as a Result of the
Verification of Its Membership”, which was drafted in its final version at
a meeting of regional committees, regional bureaux and Gubernia Committees
of the R.C.P. and endorsed by the Central Committee and the Eleventh
Congress of the Party (see The C.P.S. U. in the Resolutions and
Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central
Committee, Part I, 1954, pp. 597-98).

December 26, 1921
I

Comrades, having decided to continue our talk—I think
we have no doubts on this score—I just want to say that it is now
about half past eight and we can sit on till half past nine or even
later. We must pick a question which we

    

are most interested in. If, as one comrade said here, it is the agrarian
question, then I say—let us distribute our time on those questions
which are most important for you. My business here, as I understand it, is
mainly to listen and make notes. What I wanted to tell you I have already
told you at the congress. I am trying to take down notes as to what
gubernia, what uyezd the complaints come from and what most of them are
about. I think the time should be distributed in such a way that after the
question of compulsory carting tax has been dealt with, we should figure
out what questions seem most important so that delegates from different
gubernias can have time to have their say on them. My business here is to
make as detailed notes as possible in order to know what the non-Party
delegates have spoken about. In any case, it will be very difficult for me
to answer some of the questions that will be put here, as I have no
information at hand and cannot give an immediate reply. That is why I
suggest choosing questions which are considered the most important and on
which delegates will speak from the floor, the way the carting tax question
has been raised, and I shall write down every statement made by local
people.  
2

Comrades, it is very difficult for me to say even a few words on this
question, because all the questions that have been put here I am writing
down with a note of what gubernia they come from, but without exact
information from the institution concerned I am unable straight off to
answer the questions that have been put here. The comrade from the
Commissariat for Labour who has just spoken, found it much easier because
he has before his eyes a published law and an explanation of what
mitigations the enforcement of that law will yield. Without information
from the commissariats concerned I can give no definite answers to some of
the questions that have been put here.  

A number of notes have been sent up. One of them is from a Ukrainian
comrade from Kiev, who asks why I have never visited the Ukraine. It is a
long journey to the Ukraine, and a difficult one to undertake.  
 

One comrade asks, who is going to pay for the horses killed in the
carting service. I have made a note of that question. The comrade has
already answered in a general way.  

Two notes have been handed up on the question of the tax in kind and
about it being impossible for the needy peasant to buy textile
goods. Naturally, the peasants in all gubernias these days have many
difficulties like these to bear. Without information from the institution
concerned I am unable to answer this sort of question just now.  

Can we help and to what extent can we help? I repeat, that at the
moment I can give no reply. It seems to me that the most important thing
that has been said here on the question of carting service is—as far
as I can gather from a glance at my notes (and I have written down briefly
what each of the comrades has said here)—the most important thing, to
my mind, are the instances of abuse and irregularities on the part of the

Zheleskoms.[2] Most of the complaints have been about the stints
assigned by the Zheleskoms being heavy, about the hard time peasants are
having, about there being far too many irregularities in the distribution
and assignment of jobs, especially at a time when they are simply harmful
to the peasants’ farm work. I have made notes of all these remarks, and a
note that when the last three-week campaign was held, all comrades from the
centre were sent out to the local areas. I asked for exact information on
all irregularities connected with fuel work, and on all abuses, as well as
a number of reports to be collected. I have already begun to receive
letters about this, but recently, owing to ill-health, which made me
confine myself only to a general report at the congress, I have not been
able to deal with these letters myself. This will be entrusted to another
comrade, who is temporarily taking my place, but we shall definitely
collect all the information that has come in during the last three-week
campaign. The complaints about the irregularities and abuses of the
Zheleskoms I consider, on the whole, undoubtedly correct. One of the
principal reasons why it was decided to introduce the carting tax which the
comrade from the Labour Commissariat has spoken about here is that, unless
the amount of work to be done is properly determined (this attempt is being

    

made by the fixing of a six-day period of work in the law), unless this is
properly determined in the law, abuses by the gubernia logging committees
and the Zheleskoms are bound to take place and will be very difficult to
combat. But when the law definitely declares, as it now does, how many work
days are required and there will be a known set task fixing how much work
is to be done in the given number of days, the abuses will be much easier
to combat. Naturally, the fight against abuses by these bodies in the
gubernias and uyezds is no easy job, especially when, as a comrade here
pointed out, many of the old employees, the former land owners and former
timber contractors have wormed their way into these bodies. A stricter eye
must be kept on this in the local areas and we must have more comrades from
among the non-Party peasants in the Central Executive Committee, who could
be applied to in the event of a complaint failing to reach its destination,
and who would raise the question at a sitting of the C.E.C. and demand an
investigation into the abuses. These measures will be put through at this
congress in any case. The number of C.E.C. members from among the non-Party
peasants, as comrades taking part in the congress have told me, will
definitely be increased. By this means it will be possible to keep an eye
on abuses by the Zheleskoms and easier to combat them when there will be
more non-Party peasant members in the C.E.C. I repeat, I am making a note
of all the remarks that are made here and shall write to the
appropriate commissariat or economic council about each of them in order to
have proper measures taken. I cannot of course give a reply offhand to each
particular question without getting the information from the commissariat
concerned.  
3

I have asked Comrade Kalinin for two minutes to clear up any
misunderstanding that his words may have

caused.[3] I am sure he did not intend to impute to me the idea that I
ever suggested burning prayer-books. Needless to say, I never suggested
such a thing and never could. You know that according to our Constitution,
the fundamental law

    

of our Republic, freedom of conscience in respect of religion is fully
guaranteed to every person.


Another word to the comrade who spoke about the very difficult
situation in some of the uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia. These uyezds are in the
famine-stricken area. Our main hope now will be in the agreement which the
American Government has offered us. We shall conclude it within the next
few days. Under this agreement the American Government offers twenty
million dollars. We shall give ten million, making thirty million dollars
altogether—that is, sixty million gold rubles. This is a sizable
sum. Most of the spring crop area, if not all of it, will be sown. In
addition we are sending men to Canada. I think we shall be able to spend an
extra sum from the gold fund to buy a little more seed. The main problem
now, of course, is the famine, the dearth of fodder. The sowing of spring
crops must be done as fully as possible. Every effort in this direction
will be made. (Applause.)

[1]
The Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets sat in Moscow on
December 23-28, 1921. It was attended by 1,993 delegates, of whom 1,631
were voting delegates and 362 had a consultative voice.  1,850 delegates
were Communists, 139 non-Party people, and one delegate each with a
consultative voice from the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the
Anarcho-Universalists, the Jewish Social-Democratic Labour Party Poale Zion
and the Molokan communities.  

The congress discussed the reports and passed the following decisions:

1) Resolution on the report of the All-Russia C.E.C. and the C.P.C. on the
Republic’s home and foreign policies;

2) Declaration on the international position of the R.S.F.S.R.;

3) Resolution on the building up of the Red Army and Navy;

4) Resolution on relief to the famine-stricken areas;

5) Appeal for collection of the tax in kind;

6) Instructions on questions of economic activities;

7) Resolution on the preliminary results of the New Economic Policy and on
the Republic’s industry;

8) Resolution on measures for strengthening and developing agriculture;

9) Resolution on agricultural co-operation;

10) Resolution on finances and the budget;

11) Resolution of the C.P.C. on electrification endorsed by the Ninth
Congress of Soviets;

   

12) Resolution on Soviet administrative activities; 13) Resolution on the
Vecheka.  

Lenin put in a great deal of work in preparing for the congress and
directing its proceedings (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 141-81).  

The Meeting of Non-Party Delegates held on the evening of
December 26, 1921, discussed two questions: that of the compulsory carting
tax (reporter Lemberg, representative of the Commissariat for Labour), and
the agrarian question. The meeting was chaired by M. I. Kalinin.  

The first two speeches were delivered by Lenin during the discussion of
the carting tax question, the second speech following a request by one of
the congress delegates asking Lenin to say a few words “about the
servicing of Soviet institutions”.  
 Lenin’s third speech was delivered during the discussion of the
agrarian question following a speech by Kalinin. Lenin made brief notes of
the speeches at the meeting (see Lenin Miscellany XXIII,
pp. 292-94, 297-98).

Zheleskoms—Russian abbreviated name for Railway Logging
Committees supervising felling operations and the carting of wood to the
railway stations for the needs of industry and transport.





[3]
Pointing out that twenty instead of five non-Party peasants would now
be elected to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, Kalinin said:
“Some comrades say that we elect men by their beards. Excuse me, Comrades,
but a beard means a lot to a peasant. It stands for his way of life, his
thinking, and the best example is the peasant Petrushkin sitting here next
to me. If Comrade Lenin says, ’I’ll go and burn all the prayer-books’, I’d
like to know the opinion of a non-Party man, and I’ll ask Petrushkin what
the peasants will think of my wanting to burn the prayer- books. He 11 say,
’Who cares, let them burn’. He’s a young man, but if I ask a bearded man
he’ll say we ought to wait a bit. This means a lot to us”
(Istorichesky Arkhiv [Historical Archives], No. 2, 1962, p. 76).

The Plenum of the C.C., R.C.P. on 28.XII.1921 considered the question
of the role and functions of the trade unions under the New Economic
Policy. The plenum heard the reports of Comrades Rudzutak, Andreyev and
Shlyapnikov (the planned report by Comrade Lutovinov was not made owing to
failure to call the reporter out in time). After an exchange of opinions it
was decided to submit the original draft theses of Comrades Rudzutak and
Andreyev to a committee of these two comrades with the addition of Lenin
and to charge this committee with drafting theses for endorsement by the
Politbureau.  

(Several lines will be added to this after approval of the
draft by the committee and then the Politbureau.)  
    

DRAFT
1. The New Economic Policy and The Trade Unions

The New Economic Policy introduces a number of important changes in the
position of the proletariat and, consequently, in that of the trade
unions. These changes are due to the fact that in their entire policy of
transition from capitalism to socialism the Communist Party and the Soviet
government are now adopting special methods to implement this transition
and in many respects are operating differently from the way they operated
before: they are capturing a number of positions by a “new flanking
movement”, so to speak; they are drawing back in order to make better
preparations for a new offensive against capitalism. In particular, a free
market and capitalism, both subject to state control, are now being
permitted and are developing; on the other hand, the state enterprises are
being put on what is called a profit basis, i.e., they are in effect being
largely reorganised on commercial and capitalist lines.  
2. State Capitalism in the Proletarian State and the
Trade Unions

The proletarian state may, without changing its own nature,
permit freedom of trade and the development of capitalism only within
certain bounds, and only on the condition that the state regulates
(supervises, controls, determines the forms and methods of, etc.) private
trade and private capitalism. The success of such regulation will depend
not only on the state authorities, but also, and to a larger extent, on the
degree of maturity of the proletariat and of the masses of the working
people generally, on their cultural level, etc. But even if this regulation
is completely successful, the antagonism of class interests between labour
and capital will certainly remain. Consequently, one of the main tasks that
will henceforth confront the trade unions is to protect in every way the
class interests of the proletariat in its struggle against capital. This
task should be openly put in the forefront, and the machinery

    

of the trade unions must be reorganised, modified or supplemented accordingly;
strike funds, and so on should be formed, or rather, built up.

3. The State Enterprises that Are Being Put on a Profit
Basis and the Trade Unions

The conversion of state enterprises to what is called the profit basis is
inevitably and inseparably connected with the New Economic Policy; in the near
future this is bound to become the predominant, if not the sole, form of state
enterprise. Actually, this means that with the free market now permitted and
developing, the state enterprises, will to a large extent be put on a
commercial, capitalist basis. This circumstance, in view of the urgent need to
increase the productivity of labour and make every state enterprise pay its way
and show a profit, and in view of the inevitable rise of narrow departmental
interests and excessive departmental zeal, is bound to create a certain
conflict of interests between the masses of workers and the directors and
managers of the state enterprises, or the government departments in charge of
them. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the trade unions, in regard to
the state enterprises as well, to protect the class interests of the proletariat
and the working masses against their employers.

4. The Essential Difference Between the Class Struggle
of the Proletariat in a State which Recognises Private Ownership of the
Land, Factories, etc., and where Political Power is in the Hands of the
Capitalist Class, and the Class Struggle of the Proletariat in a State
which Does Not Recognise Private Ownership of the Land and the Majority of
the Large Enterprises and Where Political Power is in the Hands of the
Proletariat 

As long as classes exist, the class struggle is inevitable. In the
period of transition from capitalism to socialism the existence of classes
is inevitable; and the Programme of the

    

Russian Communist Party definitely states that we are taking only the first
steps in the transition from capitalism to socialism. Hence, the Communist
Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions must frankly admit the
existence of a class struggle and its inevitability until the electrification of
industry and agriculture is completed— at least in the main—and
until small production and the supremacy of the market are thereby cut off at
the roots. It follows from this that at the present moment we can under no
circumstances abandon the idea of the strike struggle, we cannot, as a matter of
principle, conceive the possibility of a law that makes compulsory state
mediation take the place of strikes.


On the other hand, it is obvious that under capitalism the ultimate object of
the strike struggle is to break up the state machine and to overthrow the given
class state power. Under the transitional type of proletarian state such as
ours, however, the ultimate object of the strike struggle can only be to fortify
the proletarian state and the state power of the proletarian class by combating
the bureaucratic distortions, mistakes and flaws in this state, and by curbing
the class appetites of the capitalists who try to evade its control, etc. Hence,
the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions must never
forget and must never conceal from the workers and the mass of the working
people that the strike struggle in a state where the proletariat holds
political power can be explained and justified only by the bureaucratic
distortions of the proletarian state and by all sorts of survivals of the old
capitalist system in the government offices on the one hand, and by the
political immaturity and cultural backwardness of the mass of the working people
on the other. When the law courts and all other organs of the state are built on
a class basis, by the working people themselves, with the bourgeoisie excluded
from the electorate, the normal method of settling conflicts between labour and
capital, between employed and employers, will more and more often find
expression in the working people turning directly to the state authorities.

    

5. Reversion to Voluntary Trade Union Membership

The compulsory wholesale signing up of all workers for membership in
the trade unions is no longer consistent with the present degree of
socialisation achieved in industry or with the level of development of the
masses. Compulsory membership has moreover introduced a certain degree of
bureaucratic distortion into the trade unions themselves. It is absolutely
essential to revert for a fairly considerable length of time to the
practice of voluntary membership in the trade unions. Under no
circumstances must trade union members be required to subscribe to any
specific political views; in this respect, as well as in respect of
religion, the trade unions must be non-partisan. All that must be required
of trade union members in the proletarian state is that they should
understand comradely discipline and the necessity of uniting the workers’
forces for the purpose of protecting the interests of the working people,
and that they should keep faith with the working people’s government, i.e.,
the Soviet government. The proletarian state must encourage the workers to
organise in trade unions both for legal and material reasons; but the trade
unions can have no rights without duties.  
6. The Trade Unions and the Management of Industry

Following its seizure of political power, the principal and fundamental
interest of the proletariat lies in securing an increase in output, an
enormous increase in the productive forces of society. This task, which is
clearly formulated in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party, is
particularly urgent in our country today owing to post-war ruin, famine and
economic dislocation. Hence, the speediest and most enduring success in
restoring large-scale industry is a condition without which no success can
be achieved in the general cause of emancipating labour from the yoke of
capital and securing the victory of socialism. To achieve

    

this success in Russia, in the conditions at present obtaining in that
country, it is absolutely essential that all authority in the factories be
concentrated in the hands of the management. The factory management,
usually built up on the principle of one-man responsibility, must have
authority independently to fix and pay out wages, and also distribute
rations, working clothes, and all other supplies; it must enjoy the utmost
freedom to manoeuvre, exercise strict control of the actual successes
achieved in increasing production, in making the factory pay its way and
show a profit, and carefully select the most talented and capable
administrative personnel, etc.  

Under these circumstances, any direct interference by the trade unions
in the management of the factories must be regarded as positively harmful
and impermissible.  
It would be absolutely wrong, however, to interpret this
indisputable axiom to mean that the trade unions must play no part in the
socialist organisation of industry and in the management of state
industry. Their participation in this is necessary in the following
strictly defined forms.  
7. The Role and Functions of the Trade Unions in the
Business and Administrative Organisations of the Proletarian State

The proletariat is the class foundation of the state making the
transition from capitalism to socialism. In a country where the small
peasantry is overwhelmingly predominant the proletariat can successfully
fulfil this function if it very skilfully, cautiously and gradually
establishes an alliance with the vast majority of the peasantry. The trade
unions must collaborate closely and constantly with the government, all the
political and economic activities of which are guided by the
class-conscious vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party. Being
a school of communism in general, the trade unions must, in particular, be
a school for training the whole mass of workers, and eventually all working
people, in the art of managing socialist industry (and gradually also
agriculture).  
 

Proceeding from these principles, the trade unions’ part in the
activities connected with the business and administrative organisations of
the proletarian state should take the following main forms: 


   (1) The trade unions should help staff all the business and
   administrative bodies connected with economics by nominating their
   candidates for them and casting a consultative vote; the trade
   unions take part in these bodies too, not directly, but through the
   members of the higher state bodies, the members of business boards, members
   of the factory managements (where collegiate management is practised),
   managers, their assistants, etc., nominated by them and endorsed by the
   Communist Party and the Soviet government.  

   (2) One of the most important functions of the trade unions is to
   promote and train factory managers from among the workers and the masses of
   the working people generally. At the present time we have scores of such
   factory managers who are quite satisfactory, and hundreds who are more or
   less satisfactory, but very soon, however, we must have hundreds of the
   former and thousands of the latter. The trade unions must much more
   carefully and persistently than hitherto keep a systematic register of all
   workers and peasants capable of holding posts of this kind, and thoroughly,
   efficiently and from every aspect verify the progress they make in learning
   the art of management.  

   (3) No less important is the participation of the trade unions in all
   the planning bodies of the proletarian state. In addition to participating
   in all cultural and educational activities and in production propaganda,
   the trade unions must also, on an increasing scale, enlist the working
   class and the masses of the working people generally for all branches of
   the work of building up the state economy; they must make them familiar
   with all aspects of economic life and with all details of industrial
   operations—from the procurement of raw materials to the marketing of the
   product; give them a more and more concrete understanding of the single
   state plan of socialist economy and the worker’s and peasant’s practical
   interest in its implementation.  
 

   (4) The drawing up of wage rates and scales of supplies, etc., is one
   of the essential functions of the trade unions in the building of socialism
   and in their participation in the management of industry. In particular,
   disciplinary courts should steadily improve labour discipline and proper
   ways of promoting it and achieving increased productivity; but they must
   not interfere with the functions of the People’s Courts in general or with
   the functions of factory managements.  


This list of the major functions of the trade unions in the work of building up
socialist economy, should, of course, be drawn up in greater detail by the
competent trade union and government bodies. The most important thing is that
the trade unions should consciously and resolutely avoid direct, inexpert,
incompetent and irresponsible interference in administrative matters, which has
caused no little harm, and should start persistent, practical activities
calculated to extend over a long period of years and designed to give the
workers and all the working people generally practical training in the
art of managing the economy of the whole country.

8. Contact with the Masses—The Fundamental Condition
for all Trade Union Activity

Contact with the masses, i.e., with the overwhelming majority of the workers
(and eventually of all the working people), is the most important and most
fundamental condition for the success of all trade union activity. In all the
trade union organisations and their machinery, from bottom up, there should be
instituted, and tested in practice over a period of many years, a system of
responsible comrades—who must not all be Communists—who should
live right among the workers, study their lives in every detail, and be able
unerringly, on any question, and at any time, to judge the mood, the real needs,
aspirations, and thoughts of the masses. They must be able without a shadow of
false idealisation to define the degree of their class-consciousness and the
extent to which they are influenced by various prejudices and survivals of the
past; and they must be able

    

to win the boundless confidence of the, masses by a comradely attitude and
concern for their needs. One of the greatest and most serious dangers that
confront the numerically small Communist Party, which, as the vanguard of
the working class, is guiding a vast country in the process of transition
to socialism (for the time being without the direct support of the more
advanced countries), is isolation from the masses, the danger that the
vanguard may run too far ahead and fail to “straighten out the line”,
fail to maintain firm contact with the whole army of labour, i.e., with the
overwhelming majority of workers and peas ants. Just as the very best
factory, with the very best motors and first-class machines, will be forced
to remain idle if the transmission belts from the motors to the machines
are damaged, so our work of socialist construction must meet with
inevitable disaster if the trade unions—the transmission belts from the
Communist Party to the masses—are badly fitted or function badly. It is
not sufficient to explain, to reiterate and corroborate this truth; it must
be backed up organisationally by the whole structure of the trade unions
and by their everyday activities.  
9. The Contradictions in the Status of the Trade Unions
Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

From all the foregoing it is evident that there are a number of contradictions
in the various functions of the trade unions. On the one hand, their principal
method of operation is that of persuasion and education; on the other hand, as
participants in the exercise of state power they cannot refuse to share in
coercion. On the one hand, their main function is to protect the interests of
the masses of the working people in the most direct and immediate sense of the
term; on the other hand, as participants in the exercise of state power and
builders of the economy as a whole they cannot refuse to resort to pressure. On
the one hand, they must operate in military fashion, for the dictatorship of the
proletariat is the fiercest, most dogged and most desperate class war; on the
other hand, specifically military methods of operation

    

are least of all applicable to the trade unions. On the one hand, they must be
able to adapt themselves to the masses, to their level; on the other hand, they
must never pander to the prejudices and backwardness of the masses, but steadily
raise them to a higher and higher level, etc., etc.


These contradictions are no accident, and they will persist for several
decades. For one thing, these contradictions are inherent in every school. And
the trade unions are a school of communism. We cannot count, until the lapse of
several decades, on the majority of the workers achieving the highest level of
development and discarding all traces and memories of the “school”
for adults. Secondly, as long as survivals of capitalism and small production
remain, contradictions between them and the young shoots of socialism are
inevitable throughout the social system.


Two practical conclusions must be drawn from this. First, for the successful
conduct of trade union activities it is not enough to understand their functions
correctly, it is not enough to organise them properly. In addition, special tact
is required, ability to approach the masses in a special way in each individual
case for the purpose of raising these masses to a higher cultural, economic and
political stage with the minimum of friction.


Second, the aforementioned contradictions will inevitably give rise to disputes,
disagreements, friction, etc. A higher body is required with sufficient
authority to settle these at once. This higher body is the Communist Party and
the international federation of the Communist Parties of all countries—the
Communist International.

10. The Trade Unions and the Specialists

The main principles on this question are set forth in the Programme of the
Russian Communist Party; but these will remain paper principles unless constant
attention is paid to the facts which indicate the degree to which they are put
into practice. Recent facts of this kind are: first, cases of the murder of
engineers by workers in socialised mines not only in the Urals, but also in the
Donets Basin;

    

second, the suicide of V. V. Oldenborger, chief engineer of the Moscow

     Waterworks.[1]


The Communist Party and the Soviet government as a whole bear a far
greater share of the blame for cases of this kind than the trade unions. It
is not a question now of establishing the degree of political guilt, but of
drawing certain political conclusions. Unless our leading bodies, i.e., the
Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions, guard as the
apple of their eye every specialist who does his work conscientiously and
knows and loves it—even though the ideas of communism are totally alien
to him—it will be useless to expect any serious progress in socialist
construction. We may not be able to achieve it soon, but we must at all
costs achieve a situation in which specialists—as a separate social
stratum, which will persist until we have reached the highest stage of
development of communist society—can enjoy better conditions of life
under socialism than they enjoyed under capitalism insofar as concerns
their material and legal status, comradely collaboration with the workers
and peasants, and in the intellectual plane, i.e., finding satisfaction in
their work, realising that it is socially useful and independent of the
sordid interests of the capitalist class. Nobody will regard a government
department as being tolerably well organised if it does not take systematic
measures to provide for all the needs of the specialists, to reward the
best of them, to safeguard and protect their interests, etc., and does not
secure practical results in this. The trade unions must conduct all the
activities of the type indicated (or systematically collaborate in the
activities of all the government departments concerned) not from the point
of view of the interests of the given department, but from the point of
view of the interests of labour and of the economy as a whole. With regard
to the specialists, on the trade unions devolves the very arduous duty of
daily exercising influence on the broad masses of the working people in
order to create proper relations between them and the specialists. Only
such activities can produce really important practical results.  
    

11. The Trade Unions and Petty-Bourgeois Influences on
the Working Class

Trade unions are really effective only when they unite very broad
strata of the non-Party workers. This must give rise—particularly in a
country in which the peasantry largely predominates—to relative
stability, specifically among the trade unions, of those political
influences that serve as the superstructure over the remnants of capitalism
and over small production. These influences are petty-bourgeois, i.e.,
Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik (the Russian variety of the parties
of the II and II 1/2 Internationals) on the one hand, and anarchist on the
other. Only among these trends has any considerable number of people
remained who defend capitalism ideologically and not from selfish class
motives, and continue to believe in the non-class nature of the
“democracy”, “equality” and “liberty” in general that they preach.


It is to this socio-economic cause and not to the role of individual
groups, still less of individual persons, that we must attribute the
survivals (sometimes even the revival) in our country of such
petty-bourgeois ideas among the trade unions. The Communist Party, the
Soviet bodies that conduct cultural and educational activities and all
Communist members of trade unions must therefore devote far more attention
to the ideological struggle against petty-bourgeois influences, trends and
deviations among the trade unions, especially because the New Economic
Policy is bound to lead to a certain strengthening of capitalism. It is
urgently necessary to counteract this by intensifying the struggle against
petty-bourgeois influences upon the working class.  
The End

Discuss together with the theses.


Give this to Comrade Molotov without rewriting.


This is the end of the publishable theses, i.e., the draft of them that
is being submitted to the commission and then the Politbureau.  
 

I suggest that the resolution contained in Comrade Rudzutak’s draft be
adopted by a special decision of the Politbureau in the following wording:


Not for publication 

The Politbureau directs the Orgbureau to set up under the Orgbureau of the
Central Committee a special commission to check and replace some of the
leading officials (and if possible all communist functionaries) in the
trade union movement for the purpose of intensifying the struggle against
petty-bourgeois, S.R., Menshevik and anarchist influences and
deviations. This commission to complete its work (or most of it) by the
next, Eleventh, congress of the R.C.P. and submit its report to the

Party congress.[3] 
4.1.1922
Lenin
 

Notes

Here is the report about this in Pravda for 3.I. 1922: ((quote

[2]
Lenin started writing the Draft Theses on the Role and Functions of
the Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy soon after the plenum
of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on December 28, 1921. The draft theses were
discussed by members of the commission (A. A. Andreyev and Y. E. Rudzutak)
and members of the Politbureau; in the course of the discussion amendments
and addenda were introduced. On January 12, 1922, the draft was discussed
at a meeting of the Politbureau, which resolved that “the text of the
theses proposed by Lenin be adopted as a basis.... The theses with all the
amendments to be referred to an editorial committee consisting of Comrades
Lenin, Zinoviev, Andreyev and Bukharin for final endorsement and
publication in the name of the Central Committee with mention that the
theses are

   

supported by the Bureau of the Party group at the A.C.C.T.U. (Central Party
Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism).  

The final text of the theses was published on January 17, 1922, in
Pravda as a decision of the Central Committee, R.C.P.,
representing the C.C.’s draft theses on the question of the trade unions
for the Eleventh Congress of the Party. The congress adopted the C.C.’s
theses as a basis; during their discussion in the committee several
amendments were introduced (see The C.P.S. U. in the Resolutions and
Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central
Committee, Part I, 1954, pp. 603-12).  

Volume 33 of this edition gives the final text of the Central
Committee’s decision on “The Role and Functions of the Trade Unions Under
the New Economic Policy”. The present volume gives Lenin’s draft of the
theses.





[4]
Pravda for January 3, 1922, published a news-item reporting
the “Suicide of Engineer Oldenborger” which stated: “The Moscow Soviet,
in agreement with the Moscow Committee of the R.C.P., appointed a special
commission to investigate the causes of the suicide of V. V. Oldenborger,
Chief Engineer of the Moscow Municipal Waterworks. The Commission found
that the deceased was not only a highly skilled employee, but a man utterly
devoted to his work. The cause of suicide were the difficult conditions,
which interfered with the daily routine of Oldenborger’s work. Some of the
members of the Waterworks Special Trio, instead of trying to improve things
at Moscow’s Waterworks, made them more difficult and complicated than ever;
Engineer Semyonov, Chief Inspector of the People’s Commissariat for
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, who is a member of this Trio, was rude,
cavilling and bureaucratic in his relations with Oldenborger;
Makarov-Zemlyansky, Chief Inspector of the same commissariat and a former
clerk at the Waterworks, carried on a ceaseless persecution of Oldenborger;
and Yelagin and Merkulov, workers of the Alexeyevsk Pump-House, accused
Oldenborger groundlessly of technical disorganisation of the Waterworks and
of an attitude of disrespect towards the communist group on the part of the
employees. All this was bound to have its effect on the emotional state of
the deceased. The commission considers the continued employment of
Makarov-Zemlyansky impermissible not only in the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection, but in Soviet service generally, as being a person who is alien
to the spirit of Soviet service, an intrigant who has earned among the
employees of the Waterworks the reputation of being a dishonest man. The
commission also found that engineer Semyonov of the W.P.I. should not be
allowed to continue work at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection or to
have anything to do with the Moscow Municipal Waterworks, and likewise
considers it necessary that Yelagin and Merkulov should be dismissed from
the Waterworks and transferred to some other enterprise."  

See also pp. 386-87 of this volume.





[3]
Lenin’s proposal that a commission be set up to check and replace some
of the leading personnel in the trade unions was based on the fact that the
trade unions were honeycombed with former Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries and that it was necessary to fix a longer record
of Communist Party membership for leading trade union officials in keeping
with the resolution of the Eleventh All-Russia Conference of the
R.C.P. “On the Question of Strengthening the Party as a Result of the
Verification of Its Membership” (see “The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions
and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the
Central Committee”, Part I, 1954, p. 596).  
 Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau. On January 20, 1922, a
commission was set up consisting of M. P. Tomsky, A. A. Andreyev and
S. I. Syrtsov. The commission reported its findings to the Eleventh
Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) (see The Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)
Verbatim Report., 1961,  pp. 246–52).

To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau

In view of the utter inadequacy (or reticence?) of the
report in Pravda on 3.1.1922 concerning the suicide of
Oldenborger and the investigations into this case 

I propose the following decision for the Politbureau: 

1) that the Moscow Soviet be asked to apply to the Presidium of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee in order to have all those persons
mentioned in the commission’s findings brought to trial; 

2) that the Presidium of the A.C.E.C. be asked to grant this request
immediately and 

3) —to give this wide publicity in the whole Soviet press;

 

4) that the People’s Commissariat for Justice be directed (under the
personal responsibility of Comrade Kursky and an appointed public
prosecutor) to handle this case skilfully, impressively and with special
care; 

5) that the Orgbureau be directed to set up a special Party Court to
try the whole communist group of the Water- works. (Some to be
expelled from the Party for good or for a time, some to be severely
reprimanded, depending on the measure of their guilt.) The trial to be held
in an impressive public manner.  

+ 6) that Izvestia and Pravda be instructed to
highlight this outrageous affair in a number of strong articles.  
4.1.1922
Lenin

Another draft resolution: 

All cases of the murder of engineers (and specialists) at Soviet
enterprises shall be reported to the Politbureau together with the results
of the investigations ((the Supreme Economic Council, the A.C.C.T.U., etc.,
through the

C.L.D.)).[1]


P.S. This is scandalous: we should ring the tocsin.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s draft decisions were adopted by the Politbureau at its meeting
on January 5, 1922.  
 The Oldenborger suicide case was examined by the Supreme Tribunal of
the All-Russia C.E.C. on March 8-14, 1922, and the guilty parties were
sentenced to various punishments.

(Re the request of Dovgalevsky for 50,000 gold rubles to be
allocated to the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory) 

I support the request and ask Comrade Molotov to put this to the vote
of the Politbureau. I ask the Politbureau members to bear in mind the
exceptional importance of

    

the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory, the tremendous services it has
already rendered and the great use it can be to us in the near future both
in military matters and in propaganda

work.[1]

The People’s Commissariat for Education should organise the supervision of
all film showings and systematise this business. All films shown in the
R.S.F.S.R. should be registered and numbered at the Commissariat for
Education. A definite proportion should be fixed for every film-showing
programme:


a) entertainment films, specially for advertisement or income (of
course, without obscenity and counter-revolution) and 

b) under the heading “From the life of peoples of all
countries”—pictures with a special propaganda message, such as:
Britain’s colonial policy in India, the work of the League of Nations, the
starving Berliners, etc., etc. Besides films, photographs of propaganda interest
should be shown with appropriate subtitles. The privately owned cinemas should
be made to yield a sufficient return to the state in the form of rent, the
owners to be allowed to increase the number of films and present new ones
subject to censor ship by the Commissariat for Education and provided the proper
proportion is maintained between entertainment films and propaganda films coming
under the heading of films “From the life of peoples of all
countries”, in order that film-makers should have an incentive for
producing new pictures. They should be allowed wide initiative within these
limits. Pictures of a propaganda and educative nature should be checked by old
Marxists and writers, to avoid a repetition of the many sad instances when
propaganda

    

with us defeated its own purpose. Special attention should be given to
organising film showings in the villages and in the East, where they are
novelties and where our propaganda, therefore, will be all the more

effective.[1]

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Managing Department of the C.P.C. forwarded this document to the
Commissariat for Education on January 27, 1922, with the following
covering letter: “I am sending you for guidance Vladimir Ilyich’s
directives on the film business.” The Commissariat for Education was
instructed:

“1) On the basis of these directives to draw up a programme of action and
forward it immediately to the Managing Department of the C.P.C. for report
to Vladimir Ilyich.

2) To submit to the Managing Department of the C.P.C. within one month a
report on what has actually been done in pursuance of these directives and
what results have been achieved.

3) To immediately report what functions have been retained by the
Commissariat for Education after the promulgation of the last decision of
the Council of Labour and Defence on the film business and who is directly
in charge of the performance of these functions” (Central Party Archives,
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.).  

In a conversation, with A. V. Lunacharsky in February 1922 Lenin “once
more stressed the necessity of establishing a definite proportion between
entertainment films and scientific films”. Vladimir Ilyich, Lunacharsky
writes in his reminiscences, said that the production of new films imbued
with communist ideas and reflecting Soviet realities should be started with
newsreel,

   

since, in his opinion, the time had not yet come for the production of such
films. “If you have a good newsreel, serious and enlightening pictures, it
doesn’t really matter if you show some worthless film with them of a more
or less usual type to attract the public. A censorship, of course, will be
needed. Counter-revolutionary and immoral films should be barred.” To this
Lenin added: “As you find your feet, what with proper handling of the
business, and receive certain loans to carry on, depending on the general
improvement in the country’s position, you will have to expand production,
and particularly make headway with useful films among the masses in the
cities, and still more in the countryside.... You must remember always that
of all the arts the most important for us is the cinema” (Sovietskoye
Kino No. 1-2, 1933, p. 10).

To Comrade Molotov for All Members of the
Politbureau

I think that “Bespartiiny” in today’s Pravda is
proposing a perfectly correct and timely

plan.[1]


I move that a commission be set up to elaborate it immediately and put
it into effect as quickly as possible, this commission to consist of
Molotov (replaceable by some body appointed by the Secretariat of the
Central Committee or the Orgbureau), Yakovenko, Teodorovich and the
“Bespartiiny” in question.  
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to an article entitled “The Ninth Congress of Soviets and
the Peasantry” published in Pravda on January 27, 1922, over the
signature Bespartiiny (Non-Party-Man). The writer propounded a plan for
popularising among the peasantry the decisions of the Ninth All-Russia
Congress of Soviets on peasant questions. Lenin’s motion was adopted by the
Politbureau on January 28, 1922.

1.11.1922
To Comrade Molotov for members of the Politbureau

I propose that the following directives to the deputy
chairman and all members of the Genoa delegation be endorsed: 

1. All members of the delegation should be posted in a general way on
all political and financial questions that are likely to be brought up at
the conference. Moreover, every member of the delegation should make a
special and thorough study of one of the most important diplomatic
and one of the most important financial questions.  

Chicherin and Litvinov are to be charged with drawing up an assignment
of these questions among all the members

    

of the delegation (with the exception of sick members like Rudzutak, etc.).


2. Every member of the delegation must prepare for the meeting on 22.11
(with the Politbureau of the C.C.) the briefest (maximum 2-3 pages
telegraphic style) of summaries of his programme of views and policies on
all cardinal questions, both diplomatic and financial.  

3. Chicherin and Litvinov are to see to it that the appropriate
literature in different languages is collected and handed out to the
members of the delegation together with a systematic collection of
documents in the Russian language.  

4. In view of the special importance and special difficulty of
financial questions, Chicherin and Litvinov, by arrangement with the
People’s Commissariat for Finance, the State Planning Commission and
A. D. Tsyurupa, are to draw up a list of financial experts and a plan of
work distribution among them; this to be done within 1 week.  

5. All members of the delegation must be perfectly familiar
with Keynes’s book (The Economic Consequences of the Peace) and
with similar bourgeois and bourgeois-pacifist books and parts of
books (Lansing on the “imperialist” nature of the war and the peace
of 1918, and so on). Preparations should be on these lines: speeches and
statements should give the communist point of view in a nutshell,
set forth in such a way as to intimate that although we are Communists and
hold such-and-such communist views we wish to cite non-Communists to this
audience and to pose the question of annulling all debts and so forth from
the bourgeois standpoint (see 6 and 7).  
6. All speeches and statements by our delegates at the conference
should be calculated in advance in such a way that whatever the course or
the outcome of the conference (even in the event of its speedy failure,
which we, of course, should try to prevent), there would be, as a result, a
brief but clear statement of the sum total of communist views (on questions
of international relations and economics) and a detailed statement of
bourgeois and bourgeois-pacifist views on the irreconcilable contradictions
of the imperialist world (and the imperialist peace).  
 

7. It is highly probable, almost certain, that all the bourgeois
delegates at the conference will immediately form a silent but strong bloc
for attacking us on account of Georgia and with all the usual accusations
of petty-bourgeois and big bourgeois diplomacy and democracy. We should be
prepared for this in advance and make sure that we are the first to attack
(apart from our main object of dividing the different countries and setting
them by the ears). The initiative in taking the offensive should be done
mostly in a veiled form, for example by “hinting” (or by bourgeois
quotations from relevant works) at the most painful and shameful points of
imperialist relations (Korea; Amritsar; public flogging of revolutionaries
in India; Lloyd George’s speech against Briand at Cannes concerning
assassinations” and so on and so forth).  
8. In view of the repeatedly proven desire on the part of our
specialists in general and the Menshevik-minded ones in particular to fool
us (very often successfully) by turning their foreign trips into a holiday
and a means of strengthening whiteguard ties, the Central Committee
proposes to limit ourselves in this case to an absolute minimum of fully
reliable experts, each of whom is to present a guarantee in writing from
the People’s Commissar concerned and from several Communists. Forty-five is
the top limit. The list of experts and of all members to be submitted for
approval to the C.C. within 11/2 weeks. This § to be taken charge of
by Comrades Litvinov, Joffe and Chicherin. They are also to choose a
business manager who will not permit night work and such-like scandalous
practices.  

I move the following addendum to the draft theses of
directives for the Genoa delegation: 
9. Our delegates should cite § 1 of the Cannes terms in their
speeches and statements as often as possible, this citing to be done,
first, exclusively in the wording of Petit Parisien, i.e., using
the’ words “system of property” and not just “system”; secondly, these
words and this § to be given an extended meaning as if implying
recognition of the inevitability of the capitalist system of property being
replaced by the communist system of property, as if the only point at issue
“between us” now remains the question of when this replacement will be
effected and in

    

what manner, i.e., by the Russian method of 1917-20 or by the Lloyd George
method of “truncated revolution” of the 1921 Irish type or the 1922

Egyptian type.[2]
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The idea of an international conference to deal with all questions
concerning the establishment of peace and economic co-operation in Europe,
and also the question of Russian debts, was put forward by the Soviet
Government, who addressed Notes to this effect to Britain, France, Japan,
Italy, and the U.S.A. (see Collected Works, Fifth Russian Edition,
Vol. 44, pp. 185-88). The decision to convene an international economic and
financial conference was taken by the Supreme Allied Council at a
conference in Cannes on January 6, 1922. The Allies invited Soviet Russia
to the conference in the hope of forcing from her a number of political and
economic concessions while at the same time establishing economic relations
with her.  
 The Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference was elected at an
emergency session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on January
27. Lenin was appointed head of the delegation with Chicherin as his deputy
“vested with all the rights as chairman in the event of circumstances
preventing Comrade Lenin from attending the conference”. Among the other
members of the delegation were L. B. Krasin, M. M. Litvinov,
N. N. Narimanov, V. V. Vorovsky and Y. E. Rudzutak. The question of Lenin
going to Genoa was widely discussed by the people of the Soviet
Republics. Numerous letters were received expressing

   

apprehension for his life and safety˜and declaring against his going
to the conference. The Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) passed a special
decision on this question, under which Lenin resigned his commission to
Chicherin as head of the delegation.  

Lenin directed the work of the delegation, drew up the C.C.’s
directives for it, and other important documents hearing on Soviet Russia’s
participation in the Genoa Conference (see pp. 394-95, 396-98, 401-404, 410
of this volume, and volumes 44 and 45 of the Fifth Russian Edition).  

The Genoa Conference sat from April 10 to May 19, 1922. It was attended
by representatives from 29 countries. The declaration by the Soviet
delegation, which was approved by Lenin and endorsed by the Council of
People’s Commissars, stated:

“While remaining true to the principles of communism, the Russian
delegation recognises that in the present epoch, which makes the parallel
existence of the old and the emergent new social system possible, economic
co-operation between states representing the two systems of property is
imperatively necessary for universal economic reconstruction”
(Materialy Genuezskoi konferentsii. [Materials of the Genoa
Conference.] Verbatim Report. Moscow, 1922, p. 78).  

The Genoa Conference failed to settle the problems confronting it. The
Soviet delegation vigorously repelled the attempts of the imperialist
powers to impose a colonial status upon Soviet Russia (the establishment of
control over Soviet finances, etc.) By proposing talks on a general
reduction of armaments and the banning of the most barbarous methods of
warfare (poison gases, military aircraft), the Soviet delegation
demonstrated to the world the peace-loving nature of Soviet Russia’s
Leninist foreign policy.





[2]
Lenin here alludes to the policy of partial concessions which the
British Government of Lloyd George carried out in the early twenties in
order to suppress the revolutionary movement for national liberation in
Ireland and Egypt.  

The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on December 6, 1920, following a long
and hard struggle for national independence by the Irish people. The Treaty
provided for the establishment of a dominion “Irish Free State” within
the British Empire. Six north-eastern counties (Ulster), the most
industrially developed part of Ireland, were alienated to Great Britain.

 After crushing the rebellion of the Egyptian people against British
rule in December 1921, the British Government was compelled in February
1922 to terminate its protectorate and proclaim Egypt an “independent
kingdom”. Egypt, however, became only nominally “independent”, since all
her territory remained occupied by Britain, who controlled the Suez Canal
zone, ruled Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, etc.

To Comrades Bukharin and Zinoviev

We must consider beforehand what people, preferably those
with a ready tongue, are going to represent the Comintern at the conference
with the II and II 1/2

Internationals.[1]

We must also consider beforehand the basic questions of tactics and
strategy to be employed at this meeting.  

The list of questions to be dealt with at the meeting should be
considered beforehand and drawn up in agreement with each of the parties
attending the meeting. On our part we should include in this list only
questions that have a direct bearing on practical joint action by the
working masses and touching on matters that are recognised as indisputable
in the official press statement of each of the three participants. We must
explain at length the reasons why we confine ourselves to such questions in
the interests of a united front. In the event of the yellow fraternity
raising mooted questions of policy, such as our attitude to the
Mensheviks., the question of Georgia, etc., we should adopt these tactics:

1) declare that the list of questions can be drawn up only by a unanimous
decision of all three participants;

2) declare that in drawing up our list of questions we were guided
exclusively by the desire for unity of action by the working masses, which
unity could be achieved immediately even under existing deep seated
political differences;

3) declare that we fully agree to questions such as our attitude to the
Mensheviks, the question of Georgia and any other questions being raised by
the II and II 1/2 Internationals, provided that they

    

agree to the following questions being raised: 1) the renegade attitude of
the II and II 1/2 Internationals to the Basle Manifesto; 2) complicity of
these same parties in the murder of Luxemburg, Liebknecht and other
Communists of Germany through the bourgeois governments which those parties
support; 3) a similar attitude of these parties to the murder of
revolutionaries in the colonies by the bourgeois parties which the II and
II 1/2 Internationals support, etc., etc. We should prepare a list., of
these and similar questions beforehand and also prepare beforehand theses
and speakers on various important questions of this nature.  

We must find occasion to declare officially that we regard the II and II’/2
Internationals only as inconsistent and vacillating participants of a bloc with
the counter revolutionary world bourgeoisie, and that we agree to attend a
meeting on the united front for the sake of achieving possible practical unity
of direct action on the part of the masses and in order to expose the political
error of the II and II 1/2 Internationals’ entire position, just
as the latter (the II and II 1/2 Internationals) have agreed to
attend a meeting with us for the sake of achieving practical unity of direct
action by the masses and in order to expose the political error of our position.

Lenin

The reference is to the forthcoming conference of the three Inter
nationals (the II, 111/2 and III Communist International). The

   

Communist International’s active fight for the creation of a united
workers’ front against the onset of the bourgeoisie and the leaning towards
unity of action on the part of the working masses compelled the leadership
of the II &onehalf International on January 19, 1922, to send a proposal
to the Comintern Executive for convening an international conference in the
spring of 1922 to consider the problems of Europe’s economic position and
action by the working class against the onset of reaction.

To Comrade Molotov (for the members of the Politbureau)

I draw attention to the article “The Genoa Conference” by
Y. Klyuchnikov in No. 13 of

Smena Vekh,[1] and propose: 

1. That the question of enlisting Klyuchnikov’s services as an expert
be discussed jointly with the members of the delegation.  
 

2. That it be made incumbent upon the whole delegation to see to it
that several articles on the same subject as that dealt with in
Klyuchnikov’s article are published in our press, only at greater length
and in fuller detail so as to cover the ground thoroughly.  

3. That every person who wishes to go as an expert from Russia or who
has been nominated for this post be made within 10 days to prepare an
article dealing in detail with Russia’s relations with foreign countries in
his selected field. Those articles (or such parts of them) which contain no
confidential matter should immediately be published in our press.  

4. That Chicherin and Litvinov be made responsible for reporting the
distribution of subjects for the articles and the names of the writers
under Points I and 2 to the Politbureau within one, week.  
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Smena Vekh 

(Change of Landmarks) a weekly journal published in Paris from October 1921
to March 1922 by a group of White \’emigr\’e intellectuals. The same group
published a collection of articles under this title in Prague in July
1921. A socio political trend formed around this journal and the
collection, which became known as Smenovekhism (its ideologists
were N. V. Ustryalov, Y. V. Klyuchnikov, S. S. Lukyanov, A.V.Bobrishchev
Pushkin, S. S. Chakhotin, Y. N. Potekhin and others).  

A slight revival of capitalist elements in Soviet Russia following the
introduction of the New Economic Policy served as the social foundation for this
trend. The Smena Vekhists regarded the N.E.P. as an evolution of Soviet rule
towards the restoration of capitalism. They stood for co-operation with the
Soviet government in the hope of the Soviet state evolving back into a
bourgeois state. Some of them were prepared loyally to co-operate with the
Soviet government and contribute to the country’s economic revival. The
Twelfth All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) (August 4-7, 1922), in its
Resolution on Anti-Soviet Parties and Trends, pointed out:

“The so-called
Smena Vekh trend has so far played and may still play an objectively progressive
role. It is rallying those groups of \’emigr\’es and Russian
intellectuals who have

“reconciled” 

themselves to the Soviet government and are prepared to work with it for
reviving the country. To this extent the Smena Vekh trend merits a
favourable attitude towards it. At the same time it should never for a
moment be forgotten that there are strong tendencies towards bourgeois
restoration among its adherents, who share with the Mensheviks and the
Socialist-Revolutionaries the hope that economic concessions will be
followed by political concessions towards a bourgeois democracy, etc.”
(The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses,
Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part 1,
1954, p. 671). Eventually, most of the Smena Vekh people sided openly with
the counter-revolution. A comment on this trend is given by Lenin in his
report to the Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P. (see present edition,
Vol. 33, p. 285- 86).

To Comrade Molotov (for members of the Politbureau)

I propose that an inquiry be made as to who was responsible for publishing in
our newspapers the other day a telegram giving a summary of Parvus’s
writings.


When the guilty party has been ascertained, I propose that the

ROSTA[1]

manager of that department be severely reprimanded and the journalist
directly responsible should be dismissed, for only a perfect fool or a
whiteguard could use our newspapers for advertising such a scoundrel as
Parvus.

Decision of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)


March 11, 1922

The Politbureau recognises that the publication of such a
telegram was improper, as it gave the impression of advertising Parvus, and
the editors of Party and Soviet news papers are directed to refrain from
publishing such telegrams in future.

Lenin’s note to the Politbureau followed the publication on February 2,
1922, in Izvestia of a telegram from Warsaw reporting the gist of
Parvus’s pamphlet Der wirtschaftliche Rettungsweg in which its
author justified the annexationist plans of German imperialism in the East,
plans for colonial enslavement of the

   

peoples of Soviet Russia. There, in Eastern Europe, Parvus wrote, “the way
is open for German expansion, for German might, for German thrift”.  

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on February 8 After
investigations into this matter the Politbureau passed a decision on March
11, 1922 (see the next document).

I propose the following draft of C.C. directives:

Without endorsing the list of experts, the C.C. directs the candidates nominated
in it to submit within a week ˜ précis of programme and
tactics (on questions that come within the terms of reference of the
given expert) for the whole Genoa Conference. All People’s
Commissars are obliged within 2 days to give written testimonials and
guarantees for their candidates nominated as experts. Should the experts
disgrace themselves in Europe they and the People’s Commissars will be
held responsible.


In furtherance of the directives concerning the Genoa Conference I propose
the following:


1. Without pre-determining in what form and at what time the speeches of our
   delegation should be made, the C.C. considers that the delegation is
   definitely obliged to develop a full, independent and integral programme on
   all cardinal issues.


2. This programme should be a bourgeois-pacifist programme with the
   reservation, timely and clearly expressed

    

by our delegation, that we do not put forward here a communist
programme—the only one that is in keeping with our views—(set it
forth briefly) because we wish to put before the other delegations, who hold
fundamentally different views, a number of palliatives and measures of a
reformist type which have already been proposed in parts in Britain and other
capitalist countries by people who share bourgeois views. Under certain
conditions this programme of palliatives could serve to mitigate the present
difficult situation (the only real way out of which is possible given a final
break with all the principles of capitalist property).


3. A tentative list of the main points of this programme:



   (1) annulment of all debts; 

   (2) application of the “Irish” solution to all colonies and dependent
   countries and nations; 

   (3) radical revision of the Versailles Treaty; 

   (4) the granting of loans on favourable terms to the countries most
   ruined by the war and too weak to recover their own feet, while being most
   important for world economy as eventual suppliers of vast quantities of
   food and raw materials; 

   (5) establishment of a unified international gold unit for the currency
   systems of a number of countries and measures to introduce this unit; 

   (6) an agreement among a number of countries on measures to combat
   inflation and depreciation of money (enumerate some of these measures);
   

   (7) agreement among a number of countries on measures for coping with
   the fuel crisis and on measures for the most rational and economical use of
   power resources on the basis of unified planned electrification; 
(8) the same in regard to the most urgent measures for reorganising and
   improving international transport to handle deliveries of raw materials and
   food.  

And so on.  


4. Such a programme should be elaborated in speeches, and if this is
impossible, printed in 3-4 European languages and handed out to the
delegates and the press (if only in the form of a précis). (In any
case it should be printed.)  

5. Only such people should be admitted as experts who are capable of
developing, and making out a case for such

    

a programme (in one or another part of it) and who have proved this
capability. The experts will have to have their programmes and plans
printed for Europe over their own signatures. ((Such a programme
will evoke comment in the press of the Third International, whose articles
will say:

this attempt “to convince” will do no harm, but practically it is
useless, because what is needed is a revolution; and in
the press of the II and II 1/2 Internationals—we shall see what they have
to say.))

Comrade Molotov, 

Please put two proposals for the Politbureau to the vote by
telephone: 

1) Not to publish the decision of the Politbureau on the figure of a
single grain tax pending a new decision after the State Planning Commission
has completed and submitted its calculations.  

(Krzhizhanovsky yesterday complained to me bitterly that they had been
doing a big job on these calculations, but it was broken off without him
having even been given a hearing. Please give him another 3–4 days and do
not publish until then.)  

2) The newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo to be closed
down. Arrangements to be made with Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn for using
the

material.{1} 
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

Kooperativnoye Dyelo (Co-operative Business)—a
socio-economic, co-operative and trade daily, organ of Centrosoyuz. The
Editor-in-Chief was N. L. Meshcheryakov. Publication started on February 1,
1922.  

Lenin’s motion (see the next document) was put before the Politbureau
at its meeting on February 15, 1922. A decision was passed “To require the
editorial board of Kooperativnoye Dyelo to submit to the
Politbureau within three days an explanation in writing concerning the
newspaper’s publication, its character, the composition of its editorial
board, staff and contributors” (Central Party Archives, Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.). The question was dealt with a
second time on February 22, when it was decided to postpone the closing
down of the newspaper for a fortnight. A final decision was reached in May,
the newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo being converted into a weekly.

      ...Now as regards the newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo.
    



??
1) The Board of Centrosoyuz, which consists only
      of Communists, says that the newspaper is necessary if the
      co-operatives are to fulfil their difficult and new organising
      work and carry out the trade tasks imposed upon them.
    




2) The paper’s editorial board consists only of
Communists: I, Sarabyanov,
Shvetsov, Kutuzov-Ilimsky, etc.
    



??


      3) A delegation of Western co-operators is coming to Russia. The
      closing of the newspaper will be taken ad vantage of by the old
      co-operators and will make co-operative work difficult.
    




4) The closing of the newspaper will be exploited
      at the Genoa Conference.
    



ha—ha!!
5) So far there has been nothing hostile to
Soviet power or communism in the paper...
    




February 11, 1922
N. Meshcheryakov




To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau:


in view of the obvious flimsiness of Comrade Meshcheryakov’s arguments, I
propose:


1) that the Board of Centrosoyuz be directed to replace the daily
newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo with a weekly; 

2) the personnel and funds thus released should be used wholly for
improving the activities of headquarters in supervising and helping to
develop proper trade by the co-operatives locally; 

3) reports on the fulfilment of § 2 to be made monthly to the
Politbureau; 

4) more contributions to be made to Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn

To Comrade Molotov (for members of the
Politbureau)

I move the following amendments to the draft resolution sent in by Zinoviev
concerning the Comintern’s participation in the planned conference of all
the workers’ parties of the world. After the words:

“unity of action among the working class masses which could be achieved
immediately, despite fundamental political, differences,” the phrases
following this should be deleted up to the words:

“that the working-class masses demand unity of
action”. The phrase beginning with these last words should be recast as
follows:

“the class-conscious workers, who are perfectly well aware of these
political differences, nevertheless, together with the vast majority of the
workers, desire and demand unity of action on practical issues most urgent and
close to the interests of the workers. There can be no doubt about this now in
the mind of any conscientious person” and so on.


My second amendment is that the phrase beginning with the words:

“all controversial issues to be avoided and questions that are not open to
argument to be brought into focus” should be amended as follows:

“and while postponing for a time the more controversial questions and
bringing into focus the less controversial, both sides, or rather all three
international organisations taking part in the conference, will naturally
count on the ultimate victory of their points of view.”  

My chief amendment is aimed at deleting the passage which calls the leaders of
the II and II 1/2 Internationals accomplices of the world bourgeoisie. You might
as well call a man a “jackass”. It is absolutely unreasonable to

    

risk wrecking an affair of tremendous practical importance for the sake of
giving oneself the extra pleasure of scolding scoundrels, whom we shall be
scolding a thousand times at another place and time. If there are still
people at the enlarged meeting of the Executive who have not grasped the
fact that the tactic of the united front will help us to overthrow the
leaders of the II and II 1/2 Internationals, these people should have an
extra number of popular lectures and talks read to them. It may be
necessary to have a specially popular pamphlet written for them and
published in French, say, if the Frenchmen have not yet grasped Marxist
tactics. Finally, it were better to adopt this resolution, not unanimously,
but by a majority (those who voted against we would afterwards put through
a special, thorough and popular course of enlightenment) than run the risk
of spoiling a practical affair for the sake of a few political youngsters
who tomorrow will be cured of their infantile disorder.  
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The first extended plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive was held
in Moscow from February 21 to March 4, 1922. It was attended by 105
delegates from 36 countries. The highlight of the meeting was the question
of the tactics of the united front. In addition, the meeting heard a report
on the situation within the various sections of the Comintern, and other
questions. The meeting adopted the theses on the struggle against war and
the war menace, the theses on the New Economic Policy, a decision on the
tactics of the united front, a resolution on the participation of the
Comintern in the proposed conference of the three Inter nationals, and a
number of other documents.  

Lenin did not sit in at the meeting owing to ill-health, but he took an
active part in preparing the meeting and elaborated the tactics for the
Comintern delegation to the conference of the three Internationals (see
pp. 393–94, 406, etc. of this volume).  

Lenin’s proposed amendments to the draft resolution on participation in
the conference of the three Internationals were adopted by the Politbureau
of the C.C. on February 23, 1922.  
 A resolution on this point was adopted by the first plenary meeting of
the Comintern Executive on March 4, 1922.

Only for circulation among members of the
     Politbureau
Draft decision for the C.C.

1. The C.C. recognises as correct the appraisal of the situation and
the tasks (of our delegation at Genoa) as given in the theses of Comrade
Litvinov.  

2. The C.C. fully empowers Vice Chairman Chicherin to act as chairman
of the delegation.  

3. In the event of Comrade Chicherin’s illness or departure his powers
shall be vested in turn in one of the two trios:

    

a) Litvinov, Krasin, Rakovsky; b) Litvinov, Joffe, Vorovsky.  

4. Our delegation should try to evade the question of acceptance of the
Cannes terms. Failing this, and in the event of our being presented with a
direct ultimatum, we should try to work Krasin’s formula:

“All countries recognise their state debts and undertake to compensate
damage and losses caused by the acts of their governments."  

If this does not work either, we should make for a break, declaring
definitely that we are prepared to recognise private debts, but that, not
wishing to play hide-and-seek, we point out that we consider them covered,
together with the whole sum of our obligations, by our counter-claims. We
accept no chief umpire between us and all the bourgeois countries, since
the dispute is between two systems of property.  

If we have to break, we should make it perfectly clear that the main
and sole reason for the break is the greed of a handful of private
capitalists, Urquhart, etc., whom the governments serve.  

As a maximum concession these capitalists can be offered:

a preferential right to concessions (i.e., if we grant X a concession on
their former property wholly or in part on such-and-such terms, we
undertake to give it to its former owner on the same terms).  

5. In view of the possibility of the bourgeois trying to prevent us
from developing our programme, we should make every effort in the very
first speech to set forth, if not develop, this programme, or at least
outline it (and immediately publish it in greater detail).  

6. In our programme we should, without concealing our communist views,
confine ourselves to a brief and passing mention .of them (for instance, in
a subordinate clause), and to a forthright statement to the effect that we
do not consider this the right place to preach our views, since we have
come for trade agreements and for an attempt to reach an agreement with the
pacifist section of the other (bourgeois) camp.  

By the pacifist section of that camp (or some other well-chosen polite
expression) we should make it clear that we mean the petty-bourgeois,
pacifist and semi-pacifist

    

democrats of the II and II 1/2 International type, and the Keynes type,
etc.  

One of our main, if not principal, political tasks at Genoa is to
single out this wing of the bourgeois camp from the rest of the camp, try
to flatter that wing, make it known that we consider possible and desirable
not only a trade, but a political agreement with them (as one of the few
chances of capitalism’s peaceful evolution towards the new order, which we,
Communists, do not greatly believe in, but which we agree and consider our
duty to help try out, as representatives of one power in face of a hostile
majority of other powers).  

Everything possible and even impossible should be done to strengthen
the pacifist wing of the bourgeoisie and increase if only slightly its
chances of success at the elections. This first and foremost. Secondly, to
disunite the bourgeois countries that will be united against us at
Genoa—such is our dual political task at Genoa, and not at all the
development of communist views.  

7. Every attempt should be made to develop at length and publicise as
widely as possible (in print, if not in speeches) the plan for the
rehabilitation of the national economy in Russia and in Europe—in the
spirit of the State Planning Commission’s researches and on the basis of
these researches.  

8. If the bourgeois camp in Genoa presents an ultimatum to us not to
touch on questions of pacifism, but to speak only on narrow trade subjects,
we should express our regret, but comply with this ultimatum, saying that
we had two aims at this conference—a pacifist aim and a trade aim. This
will leave only one.  

9. The C.C. leaves it to the delegation to elaborate the pacifist
programme, confining itself to the general directive that they should try
to develop it as broadly as possible in order to split the pacifist camp of
the international bourgeoisie away from the gross-bourgeois, aggressive
bourgeois, reactionary-bourgeois camp.  

10. On the question of trade and concessions (including the question of
loans), the forests of the North, etc., should be put forward as the
principal guarantee. We agree to no derogation of the rights of our
state. No agreements

    

are to be signed without the special consent, by telegraph, of the Central

Committee.[1] 
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on February 28, 1922,
with the following amendments moved by Stalin:

“1. The question regarding recognition of the Soviet government
should

   

be raised not at the beginning but at the close of the conference (after
attempts had been made to reach an economic agreement), and no ultimatum
should be made of it; 2. Centrosoyuz, the agricultural
co-operatives, etc., should not be put forward at the conference in
the capacity of subjects (contracting parties) (as Krasin suggests), and
only a single subject—the Russian state should be taken into
consideration” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.C., C.P.S.U.).

Comrade Molotov for Members of the Politbureau

I think the question of Genoa is clear after the memos of
Chicherin, Joffe, Krasin and Litvinov.  

I propose a draft decision.  

Plan: all members of the Politbureau attempt to come to an agreement
in writing. Failing this, all meet and sit for 1 hour
alone (and without a secretary).  

Then 1 or 2 hours with the delegation and finis.  
24.11. Lenin

I move: That the Politbureau direct Comrade Chicherin to send a Note to
Italy, a longish, meticulously courteous Note, but with plenty of digs in
it hinting that it is not we who are violating one of the first
“conditions”, the 8.III convocation, that we propose

1) confirming 8.III; but if (2) the majority are against, we protest and
propose

15.111.{1}
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The same day the Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal, and Chicherin
sent a radio-telegram to the Italian Foreign Minister on the question of
the date for convening the Genoa Conference (see Izvestia No. 47,
February 28, 1922).

I move: that in principle it be approved and that the Foreign Trade
Commissariat be directed to continue negotiations on the understanding,
however, that (1) no final decision is made without the Politbureau (which
should retain

    

the right of refusal); (2) an attempt is made to contract a

and of the People’s Commissar for Finance N. N. Krestinsky on the matter.

Zinoviev 

Stalin 

Kamenev and other members of the Politbureau: 





I propose

p. 11 (2nd part) (re changing attitude towards the Mensheviks) should
be thrown out.  

We cannot speak of this even provisionally just now. 

In my opinion the directives should be amended this way: 

AA) If you wish to raise the most controversial questions, i.e., those
that evoke the greatest hostility of the III International towards the
II and 111/2 Internationals, then we agree on condition


(a) that the list of questions be arranged with us
(b) ... and the most detailed rules of procedure in discussing the
    rights of the III International; these rights to be safeguarded in
    greatest detail, etc., etc.



    

BB) We, on our part, propose raising only the least
controversial questions with the aim of attempting partial, but joint
action by the rank and file of the working class.


If they accept AA, we shall insert: a general appraisal by us
of the II and II 1/2 Internationals, the sum of our accusations
against them, etc., etc.  

Further: on 25.III, i.e., at the preliminary meeting, our delegates
should be extremely discreet, so long as there is still hope of
achieving our purpose, i.e., enticing all 3 Internationals ((the II and the
II 1/2)) into a general conference.  

We should not make a break at once because of its composition,
and in any case we should not break without getting in touch with Moscow,
unless it is something glaringly mean, absolutely intolerable.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was written in connection with the drafting by the
Comintern Executive of directives for the Comintern’s delegation to the
conference of the three Internationals. It is a comment on the directives
which G. Y. Zinoviev drafted and sent to Lenin on March 14, 1922, with a
request to express his opinion on them before the draft was submitted to
the Comintern Executive. These directives, amended in accordance with
Lenin’s remarks and proposals, were approved by the Politbureau, and
unanimously endorsed by the Comintern Executive on March 17.

Comrade Molotov for members of the Politbureau

In view of Comrade Radek’s trip abroad, and Comrade Sosnovsky’s,
too, I hear, 

—in view of the fact that a flair for diplomacy is not one of the
strong points of these most valuable and important workers, I propose
that the following directive be issued by the Politbureau: 

“The Politbureau impresses upon all comrades travelling abroad that
the present moment calls, on the one hand, for

    

the greatest restraint in utterances and talks about the Mensheviks and the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, and, on the other hand, for a relentless
struggle against and the greatest distrust towards them (as the most
dangerous de facto accomplices of the whiteguards)”.  
17/III. Lenin

P.S. Please get this voted by telephone.[1] 
Lenin

Comrade Molotov for members of the
  Politbureau

This is not the first time that the Moscow Committee (and
Comrade Zelensky too) is showing indulgence towards communist
criminals, who deserve to be hanged.  

This is done “by mistake”. The danger of this “mistake”, however,
is enormous. I move: 

1. That Comrade Divilkovsky’s proposal be adopted.  

2. That the Moscow Committee be severely reprimanded for being
indulgent to Communists (the form of indulgence—a special
commission).  

3. That it be confirmed to all Gubernia Party Committees that for the
slightest attempt to “influence” the courts in the sense of
“mitigating” the responsibility of Communists, the C.C. will
expel such persons from the Party.  

4. That a circular be issued notifying the People’s Commissariat for
Justice (copies to the Gubernia Party Committees) to the effect that the
courts are obliged to punish Communists more severely than
non-Communists.  

People’s judges and members of the Board of the Commissariat for
Justice who fail to observe this are to be dismissed from office.

 

5. That the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee be
asked to inflict a reprimand on the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet
in the press.  
18.111. Lenin

P. S. It is a crying shame, disgraceful—the ruling Party defends
“its own” scoundrels!!  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter was written in connection with the following
incident. Following numerous complaints of abuse practised in the Central
Housing Department of the Moscow Soviet, an inspection of this department
was undertaken. Similar complaints having been received addressed to Lenin,
the inspection was carried out with the close co-operation of the C.P.C.’s
Business Manager (A. A. Divilkovsky). The inspection revealed abuses
practised by a number of top members of the staff of the Central Housing
Department with the connivance of the Department Chief of the Moscow
Communal Services Sovetnikov, a member of the Party. The Bureau of the
Moscow Committee of the R.C.P.(B.), at a joint meeting with the Presidium
of the Moscow Soviet on March 14, declared the findings of the inspection
commission to be unfounded and decided to refer the matter to a new,

   

Party commission for revision. In his letter to N. P. Gorbunov dated March
15, copies of which were forwarded to all members of the Politbureau for
their information, Divilkovsky stressed that this decision ran counter to
Lenin’s instructions that “bureaucratic banditism, especially when
practised by suspicious elements who have wormed their way into the Party”
should he relentlessly prosecuted, and he asked that this decision be
reversed and the guilty parties put on trial (Central Party Archives,
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.).  

When sending his letter to Molotov for members of the Politbureau,
Lenin wrote on it: “Gorbunov, forward immediately, show to Tsyurupa
and Rykov.”

Comrade Gorbunov, 

Read this, make a note of it for yourself and forward it
immediately to Comrade Molotov for the members of the
Politbureau, then for Tsyurupa and Rykov.  

In my opinion, the co-operatives are not the trade unions.  

The co-operatives should remain obligatory as regards membership.  

Contributions should be voluntary. If our co-operatives will carry on
trade (and not play at publishing dailies in which idle chatter-mongers
engage in political twaddle, which everyone is fed up with), then trading
should yield an income. Those who make contributions will receive an
income.  

Everybody should be a member of the co-operatives. We need this for the
future. I don’t see how this interferes with anything.  

Shares are voluntary. Those who have paid their contributions should
receive a share of the profit.  

Conclusion: I think the matter should be postponed; it should not be
raised at this session.  
18/111. Lenin

This document was written in connection with L. M. Khinchuk’s letter
dated March 17, 1922, asking Lenin for instructions whether or not the
question of voluntary principle of membership of the co-operatives should
be raised at the forthcoming Fifth Session of the Delegates’ Council of
Centrosoyuz. Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision of the
Politbureau of May 12, 1922, “On Compulsory Membership, Voluntary
Contributions and Unity of Consumers’ Co-operatives”.

Comrade Molotov

With reference to Comrade Chicherin’s motion entitled
“Elements of a first speech at the Conference” I propose the following
amendments: 

1) Lines 7 and 8 down on the first page—I propose that we speak about
“systems of property” and not just politico-economic systems.{2} 

2) On the same page, lines 8 and 9 up—all mention of “inevitable
forcible revolution and the use of sanguinary struggle” must definitely be
thrown out; instead we should speak only of the fact that we Communists do
not share the views of the pacifists—a fact which is sufficiently well
known from communist literature—but having come here as merchants, we
positively consider it our duty to give our fullest support to any attempts
at a peaceful settlement of outstanding problems.  

3) On the same page, 2nd and 3rd lines up—the words stating that our
“historic conception includes the use of forcible measures” should
definitely be deleted.  

4) Page 2, 2nd and 3rd lines down—the words about our historic
conception being definitely based on the inevitability of new world wars
should be definitely deleted.  

Under no circumstance should such frightful words be used, as this
would mean playing into the hands of our opponents. We should confine
ourselves only to mentioning that the views of the Communists do not
coincide with the views of such pacifists as the states we are beginning
negotiations with, such statesmen as Henderson, Keynes, etc., but that we
consider it our duty, in order to achieve the economic agreement we are
desirous of concluding, to do everything in our power for the broadest
possible fulfilment of at least a certain part of this pacifist programme.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

All Lenin’s amendments and remarks to the draft declaration for the
Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference submitted by Chicherin were taken
into consideration. This declaration was read out by Chicherin at the first
plenary session of the Genoa Conference on April 10, 1922.





{2}

Lenin is referring to the following draft speech submitted by
Chicherin:

“We attach the greatest importance to Point One of the Cannes resolution
concerning mutual recognition of the political and economic systems in both
camps of the present-day world” (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism- Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.). This text in Chicherin’s
draft is marked off by Lenin in the margin. The words in Chicherin’s draft
referred to in points 2, 3 and 4 of Lenin’s remarks are underlined by
Lenin.

March 27-April 2, 1922[1]
Proposal to the Draft Resolution on the Report of the
R.C.P.(B.) Delegation in the Comintern

The purpose and sense of the tactics of the united front
consist in drawing more and more masses of the workers into the struggle
against capital, even if it means making repeated offers to the leaders of
the II and II 1/2 Internationals to wage this struggle together. When the
majority of the workers have already established their class, i.e., their
Soviet, and not “general national” (i.e., in common with the bourgeoisie)
representation, and have overthrown the political domination of the
bourgeoisie, then the tactics of the united front, of course, cannot
require co-operation with parties such as that of the Mensheviks (the
“R.S.D.L.P.”) and the S.R.s (the “Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries”)
for these have turned out to be opponents of Soviet power. Influence upon
the working-class masses under Soviet rule has to be extended not
by seeking co-operation with the Mensheviks and S.R.s, but in the
manner mentioned

above.[2]

Speech on the Question of Printing Advertisements in
Pravda
April 2[3]

Comrades, an almost fatal mistake has occurred here.  I
have risen to a point of order (as the chairman made clear) and not to make
a closing speech. I have taken the floor to ask the congress to waive
standing orders and

    

procedure. There is a rule that after a decision has been passed there can
be no interference on that question. I ask the congress to give me 4 or 5
minutes in order to oppose the decision that has been wrongly passed here.


When I heard that the congress had passed this decision and when I
heard that Comrade Ryazanov had defended it (Ryazanov: “That is
not so.”) All the better—at least one absurd decision has by-passed
Ryazanov. If we were dealing here with an innocent young lady of some
twelve summers, who had learned only yesterday that there was such a thing
in the world as communism, and she would have put on a frilly white frock
with red ribbons and said that Communists were just pure tradesmen—that
would be funny, and we could enjoy a hearty laugh over it, but seriously,
what are we doing? Where will Pravda get the money to make up for
the advertisements we have deprived it of? I ask—how much money does
Pravda need to keep up with Izvestia? You don’t know? Nor
do I!

Notes at the Congress Meeting

April 2
Sedoi:

α) ... Contradictions, abnormality, inconsistency....  

β) “greatest trust” and!!?  
   

1) Groundlessness of the accusation that the C.C. is persecuting the
former Workers’ Opposition 

2) refusal to do positive work 

3) concentration on playing at opposition 

4) behaviour at metalworkers’ congress 

5) ditto after the congress 

6) is there such a division within the former Workers’
Opposition, which makes the Party draw a line between the majority who
are working loyally in the Party, despite

    

difference in views, and the minority (perhaps even an insignificant one)
who are behaving in a definitely unloyal manner.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P. (B.) was held in Moscow
from March 27 to April 2,1922. It was attended by 522 voting delegates and
164 delegates with a consultative voice.  

The items on the agenda were:

1) The political report of the Central Committee;

2) The organisational report of the Central Committee;

3) The report of the Auditing Commission;

4) The report of the Central Control Commission;

5) The report of the R.C.P. delegation in the Comintern;

6) The trade unions;

7) The Red Army;

8) Financial policy;

9) Results of the Party purge and the strengthening of the Party’s ranks;
co-reports on work with young people and on the press and propaganda;

10) Elections to the Central Committee and the Central Control
Commission. In addition, the congress set up a commission to prepare the
question of Party work in the countryside for discussion in the

   

Agrarian Section of the Party Congress and for drafting a resolution.  

Considerable preparatory work for the congress was carried out by the
C.C. under Lenin’s direction. The most important documents of the congress
were drafted by Lenin or with Lenin’s help. Lenin opened the congress,
delivered the political report of the C.C., wound up the debate on the
report, spoke about the printing of advertisements in Pravda, and
made the closing speech at the congress.  

See also present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 259-326.





[2]
Lenin’s wording was incorporated wholly in the resolution of the
Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) “On the Report of the
R.C.P. Delegation in the Comintern” adopted on April 2, 1922 (see The
C.P.S. U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and
Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part I, 1954, pp. 601-03).





[3]
During the discussion of the resolution “On the Press and Propaganda”
at the Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), D. B. Ryazanov moved an
addendum, proposing that advertisements should not be printed in the Party
press. The congress adopted the motion with the amendment that
advertisements were to be forbidden not in the Party press as a whole, but
only in Pravda. Lenin was not in attendance at the moment. Upon
hearing of the congress decision he wrote the following note to
L. B. Kamenev who had chaired that session: “Comrade Kamenev, I hear that
the congress has placed a ban on advertisements in Pravda? Cannot
this be mended, it’s an obvious mistake?” (Lenin Miscellany XIII,
1930, p. 29). Kamenev did not think the decision could be altered, and
suggested that other ways be found for supporting Pravda. However,
after the list of members of the C.C. and the Central Control Commission
elected by the congress had been announced, Lenin took the floor and
proposed that this decision be reversed on the grounds that under the New
Economic Policy it would be incorrect to depend upon appropriations for the
press being made from the gold fund or revenue receipts. His motion was
adopted.  

Since Lenin’s speech was taken down in shorthand only partially and
inadequately at that, the version printed in this volume is incomplete.

I

Comrade Molotov, please put this article and my following
proposals to the vote of the Politbureau by sending them round to the
members.  

1. That there is no objection to having this article of Lenin’s
published in Izvestia and Pravda on Tuesday.  
 

2. That directives be given to the Soviet and Party press to appraise
the Berlin agreement from this angle, and to dwell at special length on the
factual existing links between the S.R.s and Mensheviks, the Right wing of
both these parties, and the international bourgeoisie.  

3. That the publication for the said purpose in all European languages
of Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting the Bolsheviks and of
S. Ivanovich’s pamphlet The Twilight of Russian Social-Democracy
should be speeded up and a detailed account given of how these pamphlets
prove the real ties that exist between the Right-wing Mensheviks and S.R.s
and international reaction.  

4. That Comrade Trotsky be directed to see to it that these and similar
materials are published in all languages with appropriate comments as
quickly as possible.  

5. That Comrade Radek be asked by wire to return to Moscow as soon as
possible with the full minutes of the Berlin Conference.  
6. That Comrade Bukharin shall be forbidden to return to Russia until
he has completed his cure.

Comrade Stalin for the Politbureau

In view of Comrade Zinoviev’s proposal, I now vote for
not having Radek called back, but asking instead for all the detailed
minutes of the Berlin Conference to be forwarded through the diplomatic
mail.  
I object most emphatically to Bukharin˜s coming here, as this
will needlessly interfere with his medical

treatment.[1]

Letters to G. Y. Zinoviev
1

On Point 1 I propose the addendum: dwell at greater length

1) on the real links between our Mensheviks and S.R.s and the common front
of the landowners and bourgeoisie against the Soviet government, special
attention being given for this purpose to Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting
the Bolsheviks (Warsaw, 1920) and S. Ivanovich’s pamphlet The
Twilight of Russian Social-Democracy, as these booklets very clearly
reveal what is known, of course, from a number of other documents—namely,
that Right-wing Mensheviks and S.R.s take refuge behind the name of a
common party, as a matter of form, while in fact they act quite independently;

2) pay special attention to showing up the identity of our Menshevik˜
and S.R.s with the leaders of the II and II’12 Internationals, the
highly pernicious nature of Otto Bauer’s recent pamphlet, which virtually
proposes and preaches panic retreat in the face of capitalism. Such
preaching we regard as tantamount to preaching panic flight at the front
during war.  

Point 2, I accept.  

Re Point 3: 

I have my doubts about this, as I believe that a precisely worded
ruling calling for unanimity should save us from making mistakes, while
general appeals on subjects clarifying the points endorsed at the Berlin
Conference (defence of Soviet Russia, etc.) will be extremely useful to us,
as we shall repeatedly make use of them in future to expose the muddle our
opponents have got themselves into.  

Re Point 4—I definitely support this.  

Re Point 5—I have no objection.  

Re Point 6: 
 

The purport of this point is not clear to me. I believe that the Berlin
agreement should be ratified immediately upon receipt of the official text
of the adopted decisions, or, better still perhaps, it should be ratified
at once with the reservation that the text being ratified was the one that
was published in Pravda on 9/IV.  
I would particularly ask you to arrange for the full text of the
minutes of the Berlin Conference to be dispatched as quickly as possible by
special courier and to check whether these minutes have been signed by the
official representatives of each of the three Internationals.

Comrade Zinoviev, 

The following should be added to those points of the Comintern
Executive’s decision on which we exchanged notes this morning: 

Criticism of the policy of the II and II 1/2 Internationals should now
be given a somewhat different character, namely, this criticism (especially
at meetings attended by workers who support the II and II 1/2
Internationals, and in special leaflets and articles written for them)
should tend to be of a clarifying nature, made with particular patience and
thoroughness, so as not to scare away these workers with harsh words, and
bring home to them the irreconcilable contradictions between the slogans
their representatives have adopted in Berlin (for example, the fight
against capital, the eight-hour day, defence of Soviet Russia, aid to the
famine-stricken) and the entire reformist policy.  

Perhaps, before publishing this, we ought to verify whether the Berlin
decisions have been ratified by the II and II 1/2 Internationals.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Conference of the Three Internationals was held in Berlin
from April 2 to 5, 1922.  

A sharp struggle developed at the conference between the
representatives of the II and II 1/2 Internationals on the one hand, and
the Communist International on the other. The Comintern delegation put
forward a proposal that a world congress should be convened, in which the
trade unions and other organisations of the workers would participate, to
discuss questions concerning the fight against the onset of capital,
against reaction, and against preparations for new imperialist wars,
concerning aid for the rehabilitation of Soviet Russia, the Treaty of
Versailles, and the rehabilitation of the devastated areas. The
representatives of the II International, supported by the delegation of the
II 1/2 International, tried to impose unacceptable terms on the Comintern
delegation, namely: the separation of Georgia from the Soviet state,
renunciation of communist cells in the mass workers’ organisations and the
release of political criminals. The Comintern delegation (Bukharin, Radek
and C. Zetkin), while rejecting these terms, nevertheless agreed to the
condition that the Soviet authorities would not apply the death penalty in
the case of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and would allow
representatives of the II and II 1/2 Internationals to attend the trial. In
his article “We Have Paid Too Much”, Lenin severely criticised these
concessions on the part of the Comintern delegation at the Berlin
Conference, which he considered erroneous (see present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 330-34).  

A general declaration was adopted at the conference recognising the
possibility of holding joint meetings and issuing joint statements on
concrete issues. The declaration called upon all the working people to hold
mass demonstrations during the Genoa Conference with slogans to fight for
an eight-hour day, against unemployment, against the onset of capital upon
the working class, in defence of the Russian revolution, in aid of Russia’s
famine-stricken areas, for the resumption by all states of political and
economic relations with Soviet Russia, for the establishment of a united
proletarian front in all countries on a national and international
scale. The conference went on record for the speedy convocation of a world
congress and set up a steering committee of nine members (three from each
International) to prepare further conferences and a congress.  

However, the reformist leadership of the II and II 1/2 Internationals
who accepted this agreement under pressure from the broad masses of the
working people, torpedoed and sabotaged the united struggle of the working
class. On May 21, 1922, a number of parties of the II and II 1/2
Internationals passed a decision to call a world congress at the Hague
without the Communists. By this means the reformist leaders blocked the
efforts to create a united front of the workers. In view of this the
Comintern delegation at the meeting of the steering committee on May 23,

   

1922, in Berlin, announced its withdrawal from the Committee of Nine.


Lenin’s remarks and proposals were made to the following draft decision
for the Presidium of the Comintern Executive in connection with the Berlin
Conference of the Three Internationals:

“1) To step up the campaign against the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries throughout the international communist press.

2) To start making systematic use of the material of the Berlin Conference
for attacking every weak spot of the opponent.

3) The general appeals of the Nine not to be issued for the time being.

4) In agitation during the demonstration on April 20, to be free-spoken in
criticising our opponents.

5) The various sections act according to the concrete conditions.

6) Any new steps by the delegation to be postponed until the question of
ratifying the Berlin results is dealt with”

(Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C.,
C.P.S.U.).  

Zinoviev sent this draft to Lenin with a request that he give his
opinion on it the same day before the Presidium of the Comintern Executive
met.

In his talk with the correspondent of the American
newspaper The New York Herald on the subject of
the Genoa Conference, Lenin stated: 

This Conference should be guided only by one economic principle. Russia
is well aware of what she can expect from the bourgeois states. The present
state of affairs cannot continue any longer. It is disastrous both for
Russia and for the whole world.  

Russia stands in need of trade with the bourgeois states. On the other
hand, the bourgeois governments are well aware that the economic life of
Europe cannot be adjusted without Russia.  

However, those who intend to offer humiliating terms to the Russian
delegation at Genoa are deeply mistaken. Russia will not allow herself to
be treated as a vanquished country. If the bourgeois governments try to
adopt such a tone towards Russia they will be committing the greatest
folly.

Comrade Stalin, 

In view of this, please get a directive passed through the Politbureau
by collecting the votes of members that “The C.C. reaffirms the
monopoly of foreign trade and resolves that a stop be put everywhere to the
working up of the question of merging the Supreme Economic Council with the
Commissariat for Foreign Trade. All People’s Commissars to sign
confidentially” and return the original to Stalin. No copies to be made.

15/V.
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This document was written in connection with the discussion of the
question of the foreign trade monopoly which was taking place in leading
Party circles at the end of 1921 and during 1922.  

The monopoly of foreign trade, established by Decree of the Council of
People’s Commissars of April 22, 1918, was repeatedly reconfirmed in
decisions of the Soviet Government. The adoption of the New Economic Policy
and expansion of trade relations with foreign countries necessitated,
legislative amendments in the sphere of foreign trade. The Theses on
Foreign Trade, which A. M. Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign
Trade, drafted at Lenin’s request, stressed the need for strengthening

   

the monopoly of foreign trade and determined the conditions for the export
and import of goods under the new conditions. Lenin approved the Theses,
which were accepted on January 4, 1922, by the Supreme Economic Commission
of the C.P.C. G. Y. Sokolnikov, N. I. Bukharin and G. L. Pyatakov were
against retaining the monopoly of foreign trade. Sokolnikov proposed that
it he abolished and replaced by a system of trade
concessions. J. V. Stalin, G. Y. Zinoviev and L. B. Kamenev stood for a
relaxation of the monopoly of foreign trade. The Politbureau of the C.C.,
R.C.P. approved the Theses on March 4, 1922, with certain amendments. The
final version of the Theses was endorsed on March 10. On the basis of these
Theses the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on March
13, 1922, passed its decision “On Foreign Trade” (published in
Izvestia No. 60, March 15, 1922).  

Despite the decision of the Politbureau, Sokolnikov continued to press
his point of view and proposed a plan under which the state corporations,
co-operatives, etc. were to he allowed to buy food abroad; M. I. Frumkin,
Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, also stood for a relaxation of
the foreign trade monopoly and proposed leaving only 4 or 5 items of
wholesale trade in the hands of the state on the basis of a firm monopoly.


Following the receipt of documents from N. N. Krestinsky the
R.S.F.S.R. Ambassador in Germany, testifying to the adverse influence which
the Party controversy on the foreign trade monopoly was having on the
business negotiations with foreign capitalists, Lenin on May 15 wrote the
draft decision printed here, together with a letter to Stalin and Frumkin
in which he pointed out that “a formal ban should be put on all
talk and negotiations and commissions, etc. concerning the relaxation of
the foreign trade monopoly” (Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth
Russian Edition, p. 260). Stalin wrote on Lenin’s letter:

“I have no objections to a ‘formal ban’ on measures to mitigate
the foreign trade monopoly at the present stage. All the same, I
think that mitigation is becoming indispensable” (Lenin. A
Biography, Moscow, 1966,



Lenin’s draft decision was endorsed by the Politbureau on May 22. See
also present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 455–59; Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition,
pp. 338–39.

... 5. Pending the establishment of conditions
    guaranteeing Soviet power against counter-revolutionary
    encroachments upon it, the revolutionary tribunals shall be given
    the right to apply capital punishment for crimes under Articles 58,
    59, 60, 61, 62, 63+64 of the Criminal Code).

Add the right, by decision of the Presidium of the All-Russia
    Central Executive Committee, to commute the death sentence to
    deportation (for a term or for life).



X X X)
Add: death penalty for illicit return from abroad. 




Comrade Kursky, 

I think the application of the death sentence should be extended
(commutable to deportation). See 1st line down—to all forms of
activity by the Mensheviks, S.R.s and so on; 

to be formulated so as to identify these acts with those of the
international bourgeoisie and their struggle against us (bribing
the press and agents, working for war and so on).  

Please return urgently with your comments.

Notes
 
 



[1]
These documents were written by Lenin in connection with the drafting
of the Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R. by the People’s Commissariat for
Justice and its discussion at the Third Session of the Ninth Convocation of
the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, which took place from May 12 to
26, 1922. The addenda and the first letter were written by Lenin to the
draft “Preamble to the Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R.” sent him by
D. I. Kursky, People’s Commissar for Justice. After a talk with Kursky on
this question, Lenin wrote his second letter with the rough draft of an
additional Article to the Criminal Code.

   

Lenin’s proposals were taken into consideration during the later drafting
of the section of the Criminal Code dealing with “Counter-Revolutionary
Crimes”.  

The Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R. was endorsed by the Third Session
of the All-Russia C.E.C. and put in force on June 1, 1922 (see
Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Workers’ and Peasants’
Government (Russ. ed.), Moscow, 1922, No. 15, June 1, Article 153,
pp. 202–39).

I think it should be put on the agenda and a reduction by one-fourth
announced, the reason given being that a real, if only small and not very
reliable, step towards a truce has been made at Genoa.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter was a reply to the inquiry of the Secretariat of the
C.C., R.C.P., asking whether or not the question of reducing the size of
the Red Army should be raised at the Third Session of the All-Russia
C.E.C. of the Ninth Convocation. A plan for reducing the size of the Red
Army was being drafted by the Revolutionary Military Council of the
Republic in connection with the question of a possible general reduction in
armaments which had been raised by the Soviet delegation at the Genoa
Conference. This question was included in the agenda of the Third Session
in a tentative form, depending on the results of the Genoa Conference. On
May 24, 1922, the All-Russia C.E.C. passed a resolution which stated:

“Thanks to the line pursued by our delegation, the Genoa Conference gives
ground for hoping that a serious reduction of the army is possible.” The
resolution went on to say:

“The Genoa Conference, however, has provided no solution to the most
pressing problems concerning the relations between the Soviet Republic and
the bourgeois states, leaving fundamental issues to be dealt with at the
Hague.... In view of this the question of reducing the army was removed
from the agenda of the Third Session. The session asked the Government and
the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs to table a pertinent motion
when the results of the Hague Conference had been ascertained (see
Third Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the
Ninth Convocation. Bulletin No. 10 (Russ. ed.), May 26, 1922,
pp. 18–19).

Comrade Stalin for the Politbureau:

The session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee has shown how
wrongly the A.C.E.C. is constituted. The great majority of its members are
officials.  

I propose that the Politbureau pass a decision:



   "To recognise as essential that no less than 60 per cent of the
   members of the A.C.E.C. should be workers and peasants not occupying any
   official posts in government bodies; that no less than 67 per cent of the
   A.C.E.C.’s members should be Communists; a three-man commission consisting
   of Comrades Kalinin, Yenukidze and Kamenev, be directed to work up this
   question for the next plenum of the C.C. To be passed first through the
   Politbureau, then to the Plenum of the C.C. for enactment by the next
   All-Russia Congress of

   Soviets.[1] 


23/V.1922
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Politbureau discussed Lenin’s motion at its meeting on May 26,
1922, and decided to pass it on as material to the commission set up by the
C.C. to steer the work of the Third Session of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee of the Ninth Convocation.

Letter to L. B. Kamenev
for Members of the Politbureau[1]
26.IX.

Comrade Kamenev, Stalin has probably already sent you the
resolution of his commission on the entry of the independent republics into
the R.S.F.S.R.  

If he has not, please take it from the secretary at once, and read
it. I spoke about it with Sokolnikov yesterday, and with Stalin
today. Tomorrow I shall see Mdivani (the Georgian Communist suspected of
“independent” sentiments).  

In my opinion the matter is of utmost importance. Stalin tends to be
somewhat hasty. Give the matter good thought (you once intended to deal
with it, and even had a bit to do with it); Zinoviev too.  

Stalin has already consented to make one concession:

in Clause 1, instead of “entry” into the R.S.F.S.R., to put:



   "Formal unification with the R.S.F.S.R. in a Union of Soviet
   Republics of Europe and Asia."  



I hope the purport of this concession is clear: we consider ourselves,
the Ukrainian S.S.R. and others, equal, and enter with them, on an equal
basis, into a new union, a new

    

federation, the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.


Clause 2 needs to be amended as well. What is needed besides the
sessions of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R. is
a 

“Federal All-Union Central Executive Committee of the Union of the
Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.”  

If the former should hold sessions once a week, and the latter once a
week (or once a fortnight even), this may be easily arranged.  

The important thing is not to provide material for the
“pro-independence” people, not to destroy their independence,
but to create another new storey, a federation of equal
republics.  

The second part of Clause 2 could stand: the dissatisfied will appeal
(against decisions of the Council of Labour and Defence, and the
Council of People’s Commissars) to the Federal All-Union Central
Executive Committee, without thereby suspending implementation
(just as in the R.S.F.S.R.).  

Clause 3 could stand, but its wording should be: “amalgamate in
federal People’s Commissariats whose seat shall be in Moscow, with
the proviso that the respective People’s Commissariats of the
R.S.F.S.R. have their authorised representatives with a small staff in all
the Republics that have joined the Union of Republics of Europe and
Asia.”  

Part 2 of Clause 3 remains; perhaps it could be said to emphasise
equality: “by agreement of the Central Executive Committees of
the member republics of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and
Asia.”  

Let’s think about Part 3: perhaps we had better substitute
“mandatory” for “desirable”? Or perhaps insert
conditionally mandatory at least in the form of a request for
instructions and the authority to decide without such instructions
solely in cases of “specially urgent importance”?  

Clause 4 could perhaps also be “amalgamate by agreement of the Central
Executive Committees”?  

Perhaps add to Clause 5: “with the establishment of joint (or general)
conferences and congresses of a purely consultative nature (or perhaps
of a solely consultative nature)?




Appropriate alterations in the 1st and 2nd comments.  
 

Stalin has agreed to delay submission of the resolution to the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee until my return. I shall arrive
on Monday, October 2. I should like to see you and Rykov for about two
hours in the morning, say 12 noon to 2 p.m., and, if necessary, in the
evening, say 5-7 or 6-8.  

That is my tentative draft. I shall add or amend on the strength of
talks with Mdivani and other comrades. I beg you to do the same, and to
reply to me.  
Yours, 
Lenin

P. S. Send copies to all members of the Political Bureau.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On August 10, 1922, the Politbureau directed the Orgbureau to set up a
commission to go into the question of relations between the R.S. F.S.R. and
the independent national Soviet Republics in preparation for the next
plenary meeting of the Party’s Central Committee. This commission, set up
on August 11, consisted of J. V. Stalin, V. V. Kuibyshev,
G. K. Orjonikidze, K. G. Rakovsky, G. Y. Sokolnikov and representatives of
the national republics—S. A. Agamali-ogly (Azerbaijan), A. F. Myasnikov
(Armenia), P. G. Mdivani (Georgia), G. I. Petrovsky (Ukraine),
A. G. Chervyakov (Byelorussia) and others.  

Stalin drafted the commission’s resolution “On the Relations Between
the R.S. F.S.R. and the Independent Republics”, which provided for the
Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia entering the Russian
Federation as autonomous republics. Stalin’s draft was forwarded for
discussion to the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Soviet
national republics. It was supported by the Central Committees of the
Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Armenia. The C.C. of the Georgian
Communist Party was against the draft resolution. At its meeting on
September 15, 1922, it passed the following decision by a majority vote:

“The union in the form of autonomisation of the independent republics
proposed on the basis of Stalin’s theses is premature. A union of economic
efforts and a common policy are necessary, but all attributes of
independence should be preserved.” The C.C. of the Byelorussian Communist
Party went on record for the preservation of treaty relations between the
independent republics. The C.C. of the Ukrainian C.P. did not discuss the
draft.  

The commission met on September 23 and 24, 1922, with V. M. Molotov in
the chair. It approved Stalin’s draft (with one abstention—the
representative from Georgia). In a special point the commission rejected
the resolution of the C.C. of the Georgian Communist Party. Stalin’s draft
was gone over point by point and approved by a majority with certain minor
amendments and addenda. Point 2 stating that the decisions of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars
and the Council of Labour and Defence of the R.S.F.S.R. were binding upon
the corresponding bodies of the national republics was carried by an 8 to 1
majority (Mdivani voting against and Petrovsky abstaining).  

The final wording of the commission’s resolution, which Lenin deals
with in his letter to the members of the Politbureau, was as follows: 
 “1. It is considered advisable that treaties be concluded between the
Soviet Republics of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia
and the R.S.F.S.R. for their formal entry

   

into the R.S.F.S.R., the question of Bokhara, Kharezm and the Far-Eastern
Republic being left open and confined to agreements with them on customs
arrangements, foreign trade, foreign and military affairs, and so on.  

“Note: Corresponding changes in the constitutions of the Republics
mentioned in Point 1 and of the R.S.F.S.R. to be made after enactment by
Soviet procedure.  

“2. In accordance with this the decisions of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R. shall be considered binding upon the
central bodies of the republics mentioned in Point 1, while the decisions
of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence
of the R.S.F.S.R. shall be binding upon the unified commissariats of these
republics.  

“Note: These republics are to be represented on the Presidium of the
All-Russia C.E.C. of the R.S.F.S.R.  

“3. External affairs (foreign affairs and foreign trade), military affairs,
ways of communication (with the exception of local transport) and Potel (the
People’s Commissariat for Post and Telegraph—Ed.) of the republics
mentioned in Point 1 shall be merged with those of the R.S.F.S.R., the
corresponding commissariats of the R.S.F.S.R. having their agents and a small
staff in the republics.


“The agents are appointed by the People’s Commissars of the
R.S. F.S.R. by arrangement with the Central Executive Commit tees of the
republics.


“It is considered advisable that the republics concerned be represented on
the corresponding foreign agencies of the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.


“4. The Commissariats for Finance, Food, Labour and National Economy of the
republics shall be formally subject to the directives of the corresponding
R.S. F.S.R. commissariats.


“5. The remaining commissariats of the republics mentioned in Point 1,
namely, the Commissariats for Justice, Education, Internal Affairs, Agriculture,
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, Public Health and Social Security, shall be
considered independent.


“Note 1: The agencies fighting counter-revolution in the aforementioned
republics shall be subject to the directives of the G.P.U. of the R.S.F.S.R.


“Note 2: The Central Executive Committees of the republics shall be granted
the right of amnesty only in civil cases.


“6. This decision, if approved by the C.C. of the R.C.P., shall not be
published, but shall be passed on to the national Central Committees as a
circular directive to be enacted through the Central Executive Committee or the
Congress of Soviets of the aforementioned republics pending the convocation of
an All Russia Congress of Soviets, at which it is to be declared as the desire
of these republics” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.).



On September 25 the commission’s materials (Stalin’s draft, the
resolution and minutes of the commission’s meetings, and the resolutions of
the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Azerbaijan and
Armenia) were sent to Lenin at Gorki. Simultaneously, without waiting for
Lenin’s instructions and without the question being considered in the
Politbureau, the Secretariat of the C.C. sent the commission’s resolution
to all the members and alternate members of the C.C. in preparation for the
latter’s plenary meeting fixed for October 5.  

After studying the Commission’s material Lenin wrote his letter to the
members of the Politbureau which is published in this volume. The letter is
dated September 27; apparently this is a slip of the pen, since the
Registration Book of Lenin’s Letters, Notes and Instructions bears an entry
stating that this letter was forwarded to the members of the Politbureau on
September 26; moreover, Lenin’s conversation with Stalin, to which
reference is made in the letter, took place on September 26; it can be
inferred from this that Lenin’s letter was written on September 26.  

In his letter to the members of the Politbureau Lenin came out against
Stalin’s idea of “autonomisation” of the independent national Soviet
Republics and suggested a fundamentally different way of uniting them by
creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (see also Lenin’s letter
“The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’\null”, present
edition, Vol. 36, pp. 605–11).  

In accordance with Lenin’s proposals the resolution drafted by the
C.C.’s Commission was revised.  

The new resolution was worded as follows: 
 “1. It is considered necessary that a treaty be concluded between the
Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Federation of Transcaucasian Republics and the
R.S.F.S.R. for their amalgamation in a Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,
each reserving the right to freely secede from membership of the Union.


“2. The supreme body of the Union shall be the Union Central Executive
Committee consisting of representatives of the central executive committees
of the R.S.F.S.R., the Transcaucasian Federation, the Ukraine and
Byelorussia pro rata to the population they represent.  

“3. The executive organ of the Union C.E.C. shall be the Union Council of
People’s Commissars appointed by the Union
C.E.C.

“4. The People’s Commissariats for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade,
Military Affairs, Railways and Post and Telegraph of the republics and
federations comprising the Union shall be merged with those of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics, the corresponding commissariats of the Union of
Republics having in the republics and federations their agents and a small staff
appoint ed by the People’s Commissars of the Union by arrangement with the
Central Executive Committees of the federations and republics.


“Note: It is considered necessary for the republics concerned to be
represented on the corresponding foreign agencies of the

   

People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade.  

“5. The People’s Commissariats for Finance, Food, National Economy,
Labour and Inspection of the republics and federations comprising the Union
of Republics, also the central agencies for fighting counter-revolution
shall be subject to the directives of the corresponding People’s
Commissariats and to the decisions of the Council of People s Commissars
and the Council of Labour and Defence of the Union of Republics.  

“6. The remaining people’s commissariats comprising the Union of
Republics, namely, the Commissariats for Justice, Education, Internal
Affairs, Agriculture, Public Health and Social Security shall be considered
independent” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.).  

On October 6, 1922, the day on which the question of the relations
between the R.S. F.S.R. and the independent republics was discussed at the
plenary meeting of the C.C., Lenin, who was unable to attend the meeting,
wrote a note to Kamenev urging the need for combating dominant-nation
chauvinism and pro posing an addendum to the resolution saying that
representatives of all the uniting republics should take their turn in
presiding at the Union Central Executive Committee (see Collected
Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 45, p. 214).  
 The C.C. plenum fully supported Lenin, adopted a resolution in the form
of C.C. directives based on his proposals, and instruct ed a new commission
to draft a bill on the formation of the U.S.S.R. for submission to the
Congress of Soviets. The members of the C.C. in their speeches strongly
denounced all manifestations of dominant-nation chauvinism. At the same
time the plenum rebuffed Mdivani, who at first objected to the formation of
the U.S.S.R. and then insisted on Georgia joining the U.S.S.R. directly,
and not through the Transcaucasian Federation.  

Guided by Lenin’s instructions, the Central Committee of the Party
directed all the subsequent work of uniting the republics.  
 On December 30, 1922, the First All-Union Congress of Soviets met to
form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

10.X.1922
Dear Comrades,

I apologise for having had to let you down. I had the toothache, which
not only kept me from my work just when I had started it, but kept me
fretting for a whole week. All meetings (at congresses) have to be
cancelled again for a week.  

I am very sorry that I cannot meet you at your congress. I hope that
Comrade Kutuzov will tell you everything in detail and convey to you my
best greetings and wishes.  
Yours, 
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Fifth All-Russia Congress of the Textile Workers Trade
Union was held in Moscow from October 6 to 11, 1922. It was attended
by 350 voting delegates and 117 delegates with voice but no vote. The
congress discussed the report of the Trade Unions Central Committee, and
reports on the state of the textile industry, on the All-Russia Congress of
Trade Unions, on the organisational question, on the conditions of labour,
on cultural work and the international labour movement among the textile
workers.  

At the opening meeting the delegates elected Lenin honorary chairman of
the congress and sent him greetings. On October 9, 1922, they invited Lenin
to the congress, and he accepted the invitation. He was unable to attend
it, however, as his health had taken a turn for the worse.  


Lenin’s message of greeting was read out at the morning session on
October 10. The platform committee, on behalf of the delegates, sent him a
letter in reply to his greetings.

definitely ensuring to the R.S.F.S.R. a part of Ekibastuz that will be

Dear Comrades, 

I thank you sincerely for the woollen blanket you have sent me. I find
it excellent. I am very sorry I was unable to see Shorov.  

My best greetings, Yours, 

Lenin V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes

Lenin wrote this letter in reply to the greetings and present received
from the Petrograd textile workers, who wrote him: 

“Dear and deeply respected Vladimir Ilyich.  

“On the occasion of its anniversary the Petrograd Textile Trust sends
you its ardent greetings and begs you to accept a woollen blanket made at
one of its mills.  

“We, Petrograd textile workers, should like the warmth of our modest
present to bring you the warmth of our hearts and also to show you that in
spite of the extremely worn-out condition of our equipment, in spite of the
devastation, the shortages and crises, we are working no worse than before
the war, which proves that we can achieve whatever we set out to do.  

“We wish you, dear Comrade Lenin, good health.”

Comrade Stalin

Please obtain today a viva voca vote of the Politbureau
members on this motion of mine: 


that Comrade Trotsky’s plan for submitting to the Government a proposal
   for reducing the army by 200,000 men in the course of January be endorsed;
   

that Comrade Trotsky be asked to state what period he considers
   possible for such a question to be introduced to the C.P.C. in the form of
   a completed

   draft.[1] 


13/XI.1922

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On November 16, 1922, the Politbureau passed a decision to reduce the
army in the course of January 1923 from 800,000 to 600,000 men. The plenum
of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) held on December 18, 1922, confirmed this decision
and urged the need for compensating this reduction by improving military
equipment, for which purpose the C.P.C. was instructed to find means of
quickly normalising the work of the munition factories. The plenum
recommended that an appeal be issued in the name of the Tenth All-Russia
Congress of Soviets to all nations, emphasising once more the striving of
the R.S. F.S.R. towards general disarmament and calling upon the peoples to
overcome the resistance which this proposal of the Soviet Republic was
meeting on the part of other states.  

The Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, on behalf of the millions of
the working people, once more solemnly confirmed their desire for peace and
peaceful labour.  

“Working people of the world!” ran the appeal of the congress. “All
who desire peaceful labour, join your efforts to the efforts

   

of Soviet Russia in order to secure peace, and safeguard mankind from
monstrous and destructive wars!...  

“The Tenth Congress of Soviets solemnly confirms its line of
peaceful policy and calls upon everyone to support this line. Let all the
peoples demand peace of their governments. The cause of peace is in the
hands of the peoples themselves. To avert, the danger of future wars the
working people of all the world must unite their efforts. Worn-out,
suffering, ruined and starving mankind must have peace secured to them at
all cost.”

Comrade Reichel, a representative of the American Society
for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, told me about the incorrect view on
the New Economic Policy prevalent

    

among some members of the Russian colony in North America.


This incorrect view could, I believe, be the result of deliberate
misinterpretation of this policy by the capitalist press and the ridiculous
tales spread by the embittered whiteguards, who have been driven out of
Soviet Russia, as well as by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.


In Europe these tales about us and especially about our New Economic
Policy are falling into disuse. The New Economic Policy has changed nothing
radically in the social system of Soviet Russia, nor can it change anything
so long as the power is in the hands of the workers—and that Soviet power
has come to stay, no one now, I think, can have any doubt. The malignity of
the capitalist press and the influx of Russian whiteguards in America
merely prove our strength.  

The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New
Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is
deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class. Our state
capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that
have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by
the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the
full confidence of the peasantry.  

Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not
proceeding as quickly as we would like it. For example, so far we have not
had a single important concession, and without foreign capital to help
develop our economy, the latter’s quick rehabilitation is inconceivable.


Those to whom the question of our New Economic Policy—the only
correct policy—is not quite clear, I would refer to the speeches of
Comrade Trotsky and my own speech at the Fourth Congress of the Communist

    International[1]

devoted to this question.


Comrade Reichel has told me about the preparatory work which the
Society for Technical Aid is doing to organise American agricultural and
other producers’ communes who wish to come out to work in Russia and intend
to bring with them new instruments of production, tractors, seeds of
improved cultures, and so on.  
 

I have already expressed my gratitude to the American comrades in my
letters to the Society for Technical Aid and the Society of Friends of
Soviet Russia in connection with the very successful work of their
agricultural communes and units in Russia in the summer of

1922.[2]


I take this opportunity to thank you once more on behalf of the Soviet
Government and to stress the fact that of all the forms of aid the
aid to our agriculture and improvement of its technical methods is the
most important and valuable for us.  

V. Ulyanov (Lenin) 

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

The Russian Colony in the U.S.A. was estimated at about three
million people in the twenties, most of whom were immigrants who had left
Russia before the revolution for political, economic or religious
motives. The members of the bourgeoisie, nobility and intelligentsia, who
had escaped from Russia after the October Socialist Revolution, were an
insignificant minority. The different social and economic status of these
groups and their different attitudes towards Soviet Russia led to the
division of the Russian colony into two hostile camps. One camp was made up
of the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia (Russian section), the Society
for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, the Russian sections of the
U. S. trade unions, the joint conference of various Russian mutual benefit
societies and other progressive workers’ organisations, around which were
united the majority of colonists. The other camp was an alliance of various
Russian petty-bourgeois and monarchist organisations united around the
anti-Soviet news paper Novoye Russkoye Slovo (The New Russian
Word).  

Lenin’s letter was addressed to that part of the Russian colony in the
U.S.A. which was grouped around the organisations that stood for friendly
relations with Soviet Russia.

Proposals adopted at a meeting of the C.C. Five
(Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Radek, Bukharin)

November 20, 1922

1. All the programmes are handed to the Executive of the Comintern or
to a committee appointed by it for detailed working up and study.  

The Executive of the Comintern is obliged within the shortest possible time to
publish all the draft programmes forwarded to it.


2. The congress confirms that all the national parties which do not yet
have their own national programmes must immediately start drafting them so
that they may be submitted to the Executive not later than within three
months of the next congress, which shall endorse them.  
 

3. The necessity of fighting for transition demands subject to
appropriate reservations making these demands dependent on concrete
conditions of place and time should be stated explicitly and categorically
in the national programmes.  

4. The theoretical basis for all such transition or limited demands
should be definitely stated in the general programme, the Fourth Congress
declaring that the Comintern emphatically condemns both the attempts to
represent the inclusion of limited demands in the programme as opportunism,
and all and any attempts to use limited demands to obscure and side-track
the basic revolutionary task.  

5. The general programme should clearly state the basic historical
types of transition demands of the national parties depending on cardinal
differences of economic structure, as for example, Britain and India, and

such-like.[2] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The agenda of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, which
was held from November 5 to December 5, 1922, contained the question of the
programme of the Communist International. The congress had before it the
programme drafted by Bukharin and tabled in his own name, and also the
draft programmes of the Communist Parties of Bulgaria and Germany and the
“Programme of Action of the Italian Communist Party”. On November 13, in
his report “Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the
World Revolution” Lenin suggested holding simply a general discussion on
all the programmes, “to make the first reading, so to speak” and to get
them printed in order to study and prepare the programme more profoundly
and thoroughly (see p resent edition, Vol. 33, pp. 418–32): During the
discussion of these drafts, lively debates revolved around the question of
transition and limited demands, as a means of preparing the masses for the
socialist revolution, for the struggle for the dictatorship of the
proletariat. Bukharin was opposed to the more general transition and
limited demands being theoretically substantiated in the programme of the
Comintern, and

   

even accused of opportunism those who urged the inclusion of these
propositions. Bukharin’s point of view was criticised by the congress
delegates. The delegation of the R.C.P. asked the platform committee of the
congress to be allowed to discuss the question of the programme within the
delegation before the congress passed any decision on it; this request was
granted by the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of the
Communist International No. 14–15, p. 31).  

A meeting of the R.C.P.(B.) delegation Bureau was held on November 20, 1922, at
which the proposals printed in this book were drawn up as a draft resolution for
the congress. According to available information, the very important points 4
and 5 were dictated by Lenin almost word for word.





[2]
The Bureau of the R.C.P. delegation, at its meeting on November 20,
1922, also drew up the following “Statement of the Russian Delegation”:

“In view of the fact that the dispute on how the transition demands should
be worded and in what part of the programme they should be treated created
the wrong impression that the divergence of opinion was on a matter of
principle, the Russian delegation lays down unanimously that the inclusion
of the transition demands into the programmes of the national sections,
their general wording and theoretical substantiation in the general part of
the programme cannot be considered as opportunism.” This statement was
read at the congress meeting on November 21, after which the presiding
committee of the congress submitted to the delegates for consideration the
proposals drafted by the Bureau of the R.C.P. delegation, to which slight
editorial changes had been made. The congress adopted the proposals as a
resolution of the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of the
Communist International No. 18, pp. 7–8). p. 428

Distribution of functions between the Deputy Chairmen: 

1. One deputy takes the C.L.D., the other two the
C.P.C. monthly.  

2. They divide the People’s Commissariats between them according (or
similar) to the spring list of 1922.  

3. Work already started (for example, the trusts—the Trust
Commission; account of expenditure on heavy industry) is to be continued by
Comrade Kamenev.  

4. Each deputy chairman undertakes a check of staffs;—a certain part
weekly or fortnightly (to be calculated and scheduled in such a way that
each check is devoted in turn to one or another People’s
Commissariat;—now top,

    

now bottom;—that each check is documented by a detailed statement in
writing; those parts of the unchecked commissariats which do not carry out
similar reductions and improvements ordered for other commissariats shall
incur a penalty, including arrest and dismissal).

All schools, including teachers and pupils, to have their
requirements in bread fully provided for over and above the given
calculations, and Comrades Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Yakovleva to figure out
exactly what amount of bread should be earmarked for this purpose, with the
addition of a minimum, specially verified, quantity for office employees.


Another 1 million gold rubles to be added for school

expenses.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s proposal was included in the decision of the Politbureau on
December 7, 1922, on the report of the State Supplies Commission. The
C.P.C. was directed to allocate to the People’s Commissariat for Education
two million gold rubles out of the money economised on the ship-repair
programme (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 45,
pp. 311–12).

Work Routine of the Deputy Chairmen and the Chairman of the
C.P.C.

1. Working hours: 11-2, 6-9; together with the C.P.C. chairman on
Monday and Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.  

2. Special meetings of all the deputies and the chairman of the
C.L.D. (minus the Politbureau, C.P.C. and C.L.D.) on these days and at
these hours whenever there is need, but generally not less than
twice a week for one hour. This hour to be fixed on the eve not later than
9 p.m.  

3. All the work of the deputies is divided into: 


   (a) close supervision over the work of the Narrow C.P.C.;

   (b) similar supervision over the work of the business meetings of the
   C.L.D. 
 

   (it is necessary to resume the business meetings of the C.L.D.
   in order to disengage the deputies for other more important work. The
   business meetings are not chaired by the deputies but
   their signatures alone endorse the decisions of these
   meetings); 

   (c) chairmanship at those parts of the C.P.C. and
   C.L.D. meetings where the chairman of the C.P.C. does not
   preside; 

   (d) participation in the Financial Committee (plus Sokolnikov and his
   deputy and the chairman of the Narrow C.P.C.; the latter need not attend
   all meetings of the Financial Committee).  

   (Perhaps arrange a meeting of the Financial Committee once a week for
   one hour chaired by the C.P.C. chairman? Think this over.); 

   (e) determining the agenda of all bodies, including the Narrow C.P.C.,
   and the order of priority, the most important questions being chosen by all
   four under the chairmanship of the C.P.C. chairman; 

   (f) close supervision of the various People’s Commissariats and their
   apparatus both by means of instructions to the People’s Commissars and
   their deputies personally and by means of studying their apparatus top and
   bottom; 

   (g) the commissariats, for this purpose (Point f), are
   allocated among the deputies, such allocation to be endorsed by the
   chairman of the C.P.C. 


4. All the above-mentioned work is distributed among the deputies in
such a way that each of the three (and if need be their assistants from
among the business managers) handles a definite job for two months
and afterwards changes it for another.  

(This is necessary in order that all the deputies may acquaint
themselves with the entire apparatus and in order to achieve real
unity of management.)  

5. The draft of such a distribution among the three deputies is to be
drawn up by them immediately and approved by all four.  

6. Since the work of improving and correcting the whole apparatus is
far more important than the work of chairman ship and the chatting with
Deputy People’s Commissars and

    

People’s Commissars, which has up till now fully occupied all the deputies’
time, it is necessary to arrange and strictly carry out a practice under
which each deputy, for not less than two hours a week, “goes down
to the bottom”, makes a personal study of all the various parts of the
apparatus, top and bottom, and the most unexpected ones at that. The
official record of such a study, made, confirmed and communicated (in
certain cases) to all government departments, should lead to a
reduction in staff and tighten up discipline throughout our state
machinery.

Comrades Kamenev, Rykov and Tsyurupa

Owing to a recurrence of my illness I must wind up all
political work and take a holiday

again.[1] Therefore our disagreements with you lose their practical
significance. I must say, however, that I utterly disagree with Rykov’s
practical addendum, and I move the exact opposite against it—namely, that
reception should be quite free, unlimited and even

extended.[2] I am leaving the details until a personal meeting.  

To a considerable extent I disagree also with the distribution of the
commissariats. I think this distribution should be more closely adjusted to
the ability for purely administrative work on the part of the various
deputies; in my opinion, the chief fault of your yesterday’s distribution
consists in the lack of such

adjustment.[3] The functions of chairmanship and supervision of the
proper legal wording

    

of both legislative acts and decisions of the Financial Committee and so
forth should be far more strictly separated from the functions of checking
and improving the administrative apparatus. Comrade Kamenev is more
suitable for the former functions (i.e., chairmanship, supervision of
proper wording, etc.)  whereas the purely administrative functions are more
in Tsyurupa’s and Rykov’s line.  

For the general reason mentioned above I must defer this question until
my return from leave. But please bear in mind that I give my consent to
your proposed distribution, not for three months (as you suggest), but
pending my return to work, should this take place earlier than within three
months.  

I see that, your distribution has overlooked such an important organ as
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, which needs someone to keep a special eye
on it. I think this could best be done by Rykov.

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the morning of December 13 Lenin had two attacks of illness. The
doctors ordered him a complete rest. “The doctors,” his sister Maria
(M. I. Ulyanova) wrote later, “had great difficulty in persuading Vladimir
Ilyich to drop work altogether and go out into the country. Meanwhile he
was to lie down for as long as

   

possible and not go for walks. In the end Vladimir Ilyich agreed to leave
town and said ‘I’ll start winding up my affairs this very day’.”  

From then on Lenin spent several days at home, dictating letters and
giving various instructions, anxious to wind up his affairs, to which he
attached great importance.





[2]
This refers to Rykov’s suggestion that the reception of visitors by
Lenin should, as a general rule, take place alter preliminary selection by
the Deputy Chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. or by the Secretary of the
Central Committee, R.C.P.

This letter deals with the distribution of functions between Deputy
Chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. Tsyurupa, Kameney and Rykov as
planned on December 12. See pp. 428–29 and 430–32 of this volume for
Lenin’s proposals on this subject.

I
Plan of an Article “What Should We Do with the W.P.I.?”

1. — Our state apparatus as a whole is most closely tied, most imbued
with the old spirit.  

In this way we may better renovate it.  
 

2. — Such a type of apparatus as that directly connected with the Central
Committee makes for the greatest mobility.  

3. — It enjoys greatest authority.  

4. — Won’t that make for too many C.C. members?  

5. The conference nature of the C.C. plenums has already grown out of
our previous Party building.  

6. — A ruling is possible limiting attendance of C.C. members at
meetings of higher government bodies (the C.P.C., C.L.D., All-Russia
Central Executive Committee, etc.).  

7. — It is possible to arrange their taking turns in attending these
meetings.  

8. — It is possible to arrange their taking turns at the meetings of
the Board of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.  

9. — Possible objections to this plan: too many inspectors, too much
supervision, too many chiefs having the right to demand an immediate reply
and tearing the staff away from their direct duties, etc.  

10. — Answer: we propose an unusual type of personnel for the W.P.I.


11. — How account for the fact that the Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs has a better type of staff? And what are the conditions for making
a similar renovated apparatus out of the W.P.I.?  

12. — The W.P.I. should start right away organising the work on new
lines, guided by five years experience.  

13. — New organisation of work on the part of the C.C. Secretariat
(training new members of the C.C. in all the details of administration).


14. — Better organisation of Politbureau meetings will come about in
the course of the work itself.  

15. — Important gain from increasing the number of
C.C. members—lessening of the personal and casual element in its
decisions, etc.

What Should We Do With the W.P.I.?

Without a doubt, the W.P.I. is an enormous difficulty for
us. So far nothing has come of it, and the question of its organisation and
even its expediency remains a question.  
I think that those who doubt whether there is any need for it are
wrong. At the same time, however, I do not deny that the problem presented
by our state machinery and the task of improving it is very difficult and
far from being solved.  

With the exception of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs,
our state apparatus is largely a survival of the past, and least of all
affected by any drastic change. It has only been slightly touched up on the
surface. In all other respects, in order to get it to work properly, it has
always been necessary for the workers’ and peasants’ state—a state built
entirely on new lines—to concentrate members of the Party in it
throughout the hierarchical framework.  

It is worth remembering how we acted in the critical moments of the
civil war, how we concentrated our best Party forces in the Red Army, how
we resorted to the mobilisation of the advanced workers from among the
Party ranks—in order to confirm what has been said.  

And so, I believe, as a result of all our attempts to reorganise the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection there emerges the conclusion that we have
not made one more attempt. Namely, we have not tried to put this matter
into the hands of our workers and peasants, by placing them at the head of
our Party as members of the Central Committee.  

I visualise this reform of the W.P.I. in the following manner: some 50
to 75 workers and peasants, fully tried and trusted as to conscientiousness
and devotion, are elected to the C.C. of the Party in addition to the other
C.C. members. At the same time, the staff of the W.P.I. should be reduced
at last (at long last!) to several hundred, consisting, on the one hand,
of persons with most experience in W.P.I. work in general, i.e., persons
who are most familiar with the general supervision of our apparatus of
highly skilled specialists and who have a knowledge of

    

both our apparatus and of the principles and problems of office work
organisation, methods of verification and investigation—and, on the other
hand, of persons of the purely secretarial, auxiliary staff.  

The task of the new members of the C.C., who have fully equal rights
with the other members of the C.C., is, by long hard work, to make a study
of and improve our state machinery. All the other members of the
W.P.I. staff are to help them in this, some as persons most familiar with
this machinery and with the work of the W.P.I., others as employees of the
secretarial type.  

At the same time the People’s Commissariat of Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection could remain the same commissariat it has been up till now. The
new members of the C.C. could be considered temporarily attached to it. The
People’s Commissar of the W.P.I. could retain his present rank, position
and rights along with the members of his Board.  

What do we stand to gain from such an organisation? First of all, we
would drop once and for all the practice of new reorganisations undertaken
on the basis of an inadequate study of our apparatus. Secondly, we would
enhance the authority of this commissariat both by means of enlisting
members of the C.C. to it and by reducing its staff to a few hundred
members. From the present position, under which the members of the People’s
Commissariat of the W.P.I. as a general rule live on sops from the
inspected institutions, we would pass immediately to a position under which
the maximum independence of the W.P.I. employees would be guaranteed either
by a very high salary (this could be achieved by reducing the number of the
staff to a few hundred very highly skilled and tested top-level workers),
or by those assistants of a purely secretarial type, who would be under the
constant control and supervision of both the above-mentioned members of the
C.C. and of the few specialists left by us after careful screening of the
commissariat’s staff.  

The new members of the Central Committee would be assigned the task of
making a closer and more careful study of our machinery of state in all its
ramifications, including, incidentally, the state trusts.  
 

This job cannot be done quickly. No definite time limit, therefore,
would be set for them. On the other hand, they could reckon on several
years work by alternating members of the C.C. working on the same
assignment, i.e., by a decision of a Party congress we would guarantee to
members of the C.C. the possibility of working at this job for several
years and then returning to their former jobs.  
Lenin

January 9, 1923 

Taken down by M. V.  

What Should We Do With the W.P.I.?
(continuation)

I foresee that this plan will evoke no end of objections,
most of which will be prompted by the vicious howl of the worst of the old
elements in our state apparatus, who have remained really old, that is,
pre-revolutionary. They will say that this will lead to nothing but
complete chaos in the work, that the C.C. members, not knowing what to do,
will loiter about the commissariats and government offices, interfering
everywhere with the work, demanding explanations, etc., etc.  

I think that the nature of these objections clearly betrays the source
they come from, and are hardly worth answering. Obviously, if we had in
mind an ordinary type of staff, some of these objections might be
warranted. But the thing is, we do not have in mind the usual type of staff
for this commissariat, but single out for it the best workers, who, on
verification by the Party congress, deserve to be elected to the C.C. In
this way, I believe, we guarantee that the staff of the People’s
Commissariat of the W.P.I. will be as good as the best of our
commissariats, namely, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. How
do we account for the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs having the best
staff of employees? In the first place, because diplomats of the old stamp
could not remain there to any noticeable degree; secondly, because we
selected people there anew, selected them by entirely new standards, by
their fitness for the new tasks; thirdly, because there, in the Foreign
Commissariat, we do not have, as in other commissariats, that plethora

    

of haphazardly selected employees who, practically speaking, have inherited
all the old qualities of officialdom; and fourthly, because the Foreign
Commissariat is working under the direct guidance of our Central
Committee. This, as a matter of fact, is the only one of our commissariats
that has been fully renovated and that is really working for the workers’
and peasants’ government and in the spirit of that government, and not
merely giving the impression of working for it, while actually, in the
main, working against it or in the wrong spirit.  

Now what conditions are we faced with in our attempt to make a truly
renovated apparatus out of the W.P.I.? The first
condition—conscientiousness, will be fully ensured by selection; the
second condition is the high qualities of the staff members as regards
their devotion to the cause and their abilities; the third condition is
their closeness to the highest Party body and their equal rights with those
who lead our Party, and, through it, the whole of our state apparatus.


It may be said that no amount of conscientiousness or Party
authoritativeness can make up for what, in this case, is the most important
thing, namely, knowledge of one’s business, knowledge of our state
apparatus, and knowledge of the way it should be remodelled.  

My reply to this is that one of the essential conditions of my proposal
is that we are not to expect quick results in the work of the new
commissariat and anticipate that this work will go on for many years. The
question then boils down to organising the work of the new commissariat.


And here I feel justified in presuming that both our Party workers and
the people now in charge of the W.P.I. have accumulated sufficient
experience, sufficient knowledge, sufficient ability and other qualities to
properly organise the training of the new C.C. members, and a practical
training at that, i.e., by combining their familiarisation with all the
details of our state apparatus with a study of what modern science has
achieved in the bourgeois states as regards efficient organisation of every
kind of staff work.  
Lenin

January 13, 1923 

Taken down by L. F.  
    

 What Should We Do With the W.P.I.?
 (continuation 2)

I assume that it goes without saying that the W.P.I. will
start at once, on the basis of five years experience, organising the work
on new lines; that it will divide the new workers into a number of groups
and assign the work among these groups systematically; that it will divide
these groups into: periodically employed people making a practical study of
foreign experience; into people engaged in theoretical work and studying
the results of modern science in the field of organisation of labour
generally and managerial work in particular. It will arrange for all the
W.P.I. workers to go through the jobs assigned to them, systematically
working from the bottom upwards, performing varied functions in varied
fields of administration, in varied localities, in varied conditions of
work as regards nationalities, and so on.  

In short, I assume that the comrades in the W.P.I. have learned
something during these five years and will be able to apply the knowledge
they have gained to the new organisation of the commissariat. Moreover, it
should not be forgotten that we have, I believe, three scientific
institutions carrying out research into problems of work organisation (the
Central Institute of Labour, a special group under the W.P.I. and a group
under the Military Commissariat). A meeting of these three groups was held

recently,[2] and it is to be hoped that their work will now proceed in
a more efficient manner and in a better team spirit than heretofore.  

What is the new work organisation that I propose on the part of the
Secretariat of our C.C.? Naturally, the increased number of C.C. members
will require a new organisation of the work. I must point out, however,
that actually we have already passed to a form of organisation of our
C.C. plenums after the type of highest conferences. The thing now is to
organise the training of these new C.C. members in all Central Committee
work and familiarise them with the work of the leading state
institutions. If we are late with this, we shall not be fulfilling one of
our main duties,, namely, that of taking advantage of our being in power in
order

    

to teach the best elements of the working people all the details of
administration. Such measures as making better arrangements for the
meetings of our Politbureau, holding them twice a week and reducing the
length of sittings, better preparation of all the documents for these
meetings and arranging for these documents to be at the disposal of all the
members of the C.C. in good time. These measures now follow from the entire
course of the work and are essential, so much so that any kind of objection
to this is hardly conceivable. Naturally, this will call for an increase in
expenditure on secretarial type personnel, but to grudge the money for
these expenses would be most unwise.  

Besides, frankly speaking, an important advantage in increasing the
number of C.C. members I consider to be the diminished chances of a
personal, incidental element being introduced in its decisions; these
decisions will be better prepared, the endorsements made at such meetings
will be more thoroughly verified, and as a result there will be greater
stability in our C.C., both as regards the continuity of its work and its
power to resist splits that might arise from insufficient contact of this
body with the masses.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Here allowance should be made for the scale of prices that existed in
1920. Owing to the continuous growth of emission during the early years of
Soviet government, paper money was rapidly depreciating. According to the
data of the Currency Board of the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the
U.S.S.R., the value of the gold ruble (taking as equivalent the gold coins
of pre-revolutionary times) averaged 1,633 paper rubles in the first
half-year of 1920, rising to 4,083 rubles in the second half-year (see
Nashe Denezhnoye Obrashcheniye. Sbornik materialov po istorii
denezhnogo obrashcheniya v 1914-1925 gg. (Our Currency Circulation. A
Collection of Materials on the History of Currency Circulation During
1914-1925.) Moscow, 1926, p. 16).

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin was elected to the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. as a voting
delegate by the Fourteenth Petrograd Gubernia Party Conference from the
supporters of the “Platform of the Ten”. The delegation was unable to
attend the congress in its elected form owing to the critical situation in
the city and the counter-revolutionary mutiny at Kronstadt which had just
started. Apparently it was in the absence of minutes recording the election
of the Petrograd delegation that Lenin wrote in the questionnaire that he
had a debating voice. Nevertheless he took p art in the voting of all the
resolutions and figured in the list of delegates to the Tenth Party
Congress as a voting delegate (see Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.),
March 8-16, 1921. Verbatim Report. Moscow, 1963, p. 729).

November 21, 1922-March 6, 1923
 

This.page.left.intentionally.blank. 
 

November 21, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


In the morning Vladimir Ilyich received

Gorbunov.[23] After 11.30 Kamenev; meeting at

6 o’clock.[24] There have been no
orders. Lydia Alexandrovna [Fotieva] has

a paper[25] for

voting[1]

which Vladimir Ilyich asked to be reminded of from 5-6 p.m. in order to
have a talk with Stalin. But Lydia Alexandrovna kept it and said that the
explanations he wished to receive from Stalin she would give him herself,
so there was no need to remind him, but Lydia Alexandrovna would remind
him. Kamenev 10.15-10.45.


November 21, evening.


Haskell—11.30  }

Stalin—12.30  } appointment for

     November 22[2]


Re Haskell and Lers (interpreter), orders given to the commandant’s office.


November 22, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


I. Morning no orders. Appointments kept.


[For] the evening—Kivdilo and Brodovsky at 6 o’clock (workers of the
porcelain

      works),[3]

will be received in the following order: at 6 they will arrive at
Gorbunov’s office and he will interview them and inform us, and then
Vladimir Ilyich will drop in for a minute.


An order has to be given concerning the pass (through the Troitsky Gate).

 

II. Vladimir Ilyich has given a letter, strictly confidential,
concerning Haskell’s proposal, to be sent round to all the members of the
Politbureau and Chicherin. Eight copies have been sent to

Nazaretyan[26] to be circulated for

       voting.[4]

Check with Burakova[27]—received.  

III. Gorbunov’s papers addressed to the presiding committee of the
Fifth All-Russia Congress of the Soviet Employees Trade

Union[28] to be given to Vladimir Ilyich to sign (to be returned to
Gorbunov after signing).  

November 23, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


At 11 in the morning Vladimir Ilyich has a meeting of the Politbureau
up to

2.30.[29] So far no orders have been given.  

If Vladimir Ilyich asks about the letter to Hoover he is to be told
that Chicherin is seeing to that himself. Haskell is leaving today at
7.20. The letter will be handed to him through Lander (as Vladimir Ilyich
asked). No reception for the evening so far.  

November 23, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).  

At 5.40 Vladimir Ilyich was in his office. Asked for the packet from

Sklyansky[30] and when the Politbureau minutes would be ready and how
this was being handled technically. I got in touch with Sklyansky, who
promised to deliver the packet in the morning of November 24.  

6.45 packet to

Sokolnikov.[31] 

8.05 Vladimir Ilyich wanted to talk with Stalin, who proved to be
engaged at a meeting of the Central Committee Secretariat. Vladimir Ilyich
said: “either in the evening or the morning, there’s no need to bother him
now.” At 8.30 he left.  

Vladimir Ilyich looked through all the new books. I gave Vladimir
Ilyich the packet from

Zinoviev[32] and the material from Zax. Vladimir Ilyich asked for the
agenda of the meeting of the Large Council of People’s Commissars and gave
a letter to be translated from Russian into English. At 10.05 Vladimir
Ilyich left.  
 

November 24, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich wanted to receive Meisner (of the Fishing Industry
Board), he may possibly receive him today—so far it is unknown.  

Possibly this evening or tomorrow in the daytime Vladimir Ilyich will
receive Sklyansky and Pantsendjansky on the question of the ship-repair

      programme.[5]
[33] 

Vladimir Ilyich asked that Earsman and

Garden[34]—delegates of the Australian Party, should be kept on phone
call this evening from 5 to 9, they will be waiting in the “Luxe” 294,
can be called through the commandant’s office.  

Burakova phoned, asked that Chicherin’s proposal concerning Vorovsky’s
wire about the Straits be given to Vladimir Ilyich for

       voting.[6]
[35] 

November 24, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

Before the meeting Vladimir Ilyich received Kamenev. From 6 to 7.30
Vladimir Ilyich was at the meeting of the Council of Labour and

Defence.[36] The question of the composition of the commission in
connection with the statement by the C.C. of Georgia was handed to Vladimir
Ilyich from the Politbureau for

voting.[37] Vladimir Ilyich did not vote.  

Passed on the voting on the Straits to be forwarded to the
Politbureau. 7.30-8.30 Sklyansky, and then Krzhizhanovsky—at the flat.


November 25, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich is

unwell,[38] he stayed only five minutes in his office, dictated three
letters over the

phone,[39] to which he wanted inquiries made later for answers.  

Maria Ilyinichna [Ulyanova] said that he should not be bothered in any
way—if he asked about the answers himself, then inquiries should be made
in the proper quarters. No reception, no orders so far. There are two
packets from Stalin and

Zinoviev[40]—but this to be kept under the hat until special
instructions and permission are given.  
 

November 25, evening.  

Came at 6 o’clock. Spoke on the telephone for several
minutes. A. D. Tsyurupa was with him from 6.30 to 7.30. Afterwards, left
immediately, asking that all Kamenev ’s papers on his desk in two folders
should be sent to

Tsyurupa,[41] and the articles on the Urquhart
concession to

Chicherin.[42] This has been done. (But part of the
materials is with Nikolai Petrovich [Gorbunov] or in the files.)  

Chicherin asked Vladimir Ilyich to be told that he would like to
receive personal instructions concerning the Urquhart concession. He
(Chicherin) is leaving tomorrow evening. This has to be reported first
thing in the morning on Sunday.

(Not yet reported.) 

8.30 to 8.45 telephone conversation. Gorbunov asked for all the
materials concerning the trusts, questions of financing and information
from Kamenev’s secretariat to be passed on to him, as Vladimir Ilyich had
asked him to show them to Tsyurupa. I have already sent Tsyurupa the
opinions on the trusts and the information from Kamenev—Tsyurupa has
received them and asked they should be left with him for a time to
study. Apparently, Nikolai Petrovich has given him some other materials.


I have not shown the packets. But they are all apparently very
important. Lydia Alexandrovna ought to be consulted about this.  

November 26, Sunday, morning (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

Vladimir Ilyich arrived at 12, spoke on the telephone, sorted out the
books, took several with him. Left at 1.30, taking V. Milyutin’s

report[43] and other papers.  

November 26, Sunday, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

Vladimir Ilyich came at 6.50, spoke on the telephone. At 7.30 Tsyurupa
arrived. At 8.30 Tsyurupa left, and so did Vladimir Ilyich.  

November 27, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich was in his office round about 12, asked for no one and
shortly went away. Through Nadezhda

    

Konstantinovna asked for all the materials on foreign trade. All sent to
his flat. No orders so far, no reception. No packets either.  

November 27, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Gorbunov asked, if possible, that the paper from Zinoviev in connection
with

Münzenberg[44] be given to Vladimir Ilyich to sign (if received)
and the materials on foreign trade to be passed on to him (Gorbunov), since
Vladimir Ilyich had asked him to show them to Tsyurupa. But today Vladimir
Ilyich has not given them. They are at his flat. No orders from Vladimir
Ilyich. A little after 6 I gave orders to the commandant’s office to
admit

Kramer[45] to the flat.  

Quite a few packets. Among them the mail from Berlin.  

November 28, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich did not come to his office, spoke twice on the phone
with Lydia

    Alexandrovna.[7]

Asked for Sorokin’s article in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn for

November 26[46] concerning

   159 directives[8]

–then

gave orders to Lydia Alexandrovna; no orders for the evening so far. I am
not leaving the packets either.  

November 28, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

At 7.45 Vladimir Ilyich asked to get hold of

Avanesov[47] and ask him whether he could phone him. Phoned a second
time and gave his number. I told Vladimir Ilyich that Avanesov was at a
board conference of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. “Then don’t
trouble, I’ll ring you in the morning.” There was a paper for Vladimir
Ilyich to sign from Gorbunov to the Presidium of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee, copies to

Bogdanov[48] and

Fomin[49] on the question of the All-Russia C.E.C. revising the decision
to transfer the creosoting works from the Supreme Economic Council to the
People’s Commissariat for

Railways.[50] Vladimir Ilyich signed it (at his flat and passed it on to
the Secretariat).  
 

November 29, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich was in his office at 12.20, sent for Stalin, who sat
till 13.40. No orders for the evening. No packets either so far.  

November 29, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Notice from the Politbureau (8812) that the question of the Union
Republics will be discussed at the Politbureau tomorrow (sent not for
information, but for

consideration).[51] 

Vladimir Ilyich phoned from 5.30 till 6. Asked whether the paper on the
ship-repair programme had been received from Stalin. Talked for several minutes
on the phone with Kamenev. Dictated over the phone his views on the ship-repair
programme which he asked to be sent to Stalin and Kamenev (this has been

done).[52] 

Asked whether a telegram had been sent to Haskell in London. The duty
secretary in Chicherin’s office answered in the

     affirmative.[9]

He will send confirmation in writing tomorrow morning. Vladimir
Ilyich has been informed.  

Avanesov was from 7.50 to 8.55. They talked in Vladimir Ilyich’s
office. Left at 9. During the talk with Avanesov inquired what date the
plenum of the Central Committee was fixed for. Tomorrow this question is on
the order of the day of the Politbureau (together with the agenda), and at
the last plenum of the C.C. it was decided to time the plenum to the
Congress of Soviets. This has been reported to Vladimir

Ilyich.[53] 

November 30, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 1.10, phoned and asked for
No. 763 of Posledniye Novosti [Latest News] for October 13. He was
interested in Peshekhonov’s article

there.[54] I found it and took it to his flat. Vladimir Ilyich was in
his office exactly five minutes and went home at once. No orders. No
packets either. Lydia Alexandrovna asked to make a note—just for
information—that Haskell’s and Chicherin’s packets addressed to Vladimir
Ilyich had been handed to Kamenev.  
 

November 30, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 6.45, asked what news there was
and when the Politbureau meeting ended.  I told Vladimir Ilyich that there
were some new books.  He asked to bring them to him. Returned the newspaper
Posledniye Novosti for October 13.  

At 7.55

Adoratsky[55] came to see Vladimir Ilyich, sat till 8.40. Vladimir
Ilyich spoke on the telephone. Asked for the minutes of the Politbureau. I
gave them to him. Vladimir Ilyich asked that the Politbureau minutes be put
away. He asked that special care be taken of Engels’s book “Political

Testament”.[56] Handed over the new books he had looked
through. Vladimir Ilyich left at 9.  

December 1, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).  

Vladimir Ilyich phoned Lydia Alexandrovna at 11.20, asked to see Molotov

at 12.[10]


Molotov and

Syrtsov[57] called, were together from 12 till 1.30. No orders for the
evening so far. No packets either.  

December 1, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

Vladimir Ilyich arrived at 5.30, and at 5.45 Tsyurupa came.  

Earsman, Garden and interpreter Voitinsky came at 7 o’clock and left at
8.40. Vladimir Ilyich left at 8.45.  

December 2, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich arrived at 12.30, stayed only 10 minutes, sent for
Lydia Alexandrovna. Asked her to collect the materials on the Fishing Board
for his interview with

Knipovich,[58] which he asked to arrange for 7 p.m. The materials are
with Gorbunov, see to it that they should all be here by 6 o’clock. Orders
have to be given at all posts for Knipovich to be let through, as he has no
pass.  

The doctor was with Vladimir Ilyich in the morning and told him that
once or even twice in two months Vladimir Ilyich had to go away for several
days for a rest. On Tuesday he did not permit him to preside, but would
permit him

    

on Thursday, but not for long—and after Thursday he was to go away
positively for several days.  

Gorbunov phoned and asked that Vladimir Ilyich be told at the first
opportunity that Rykov had left Tiflis on December 1 by express
train. Vladimir Ilyich has to be told this as he is very interested in it.


Vladimir Ilyich asked for Kamenev to see him at 8 p.m. (he phoned at
14.05).  

Lydia Alexandrovna has to be reminded to find out from Vladimir Ilyich
exactly what article of

Kin’s[59] he spoke to Tsyurupa about, as the latter can’t find it.  

December 2, evening.  

From 6.30 in his office; from 7 to 8—Knipovich; from 8 to
9.15—Kamenev.  

Gave English letter and asked to find out when Earsman was
leaving. Inquiries made of “Luxe” commandant Kaizer, who said that
Earsman would probably not be leaving today and that tomorrow he would
report the exact day of his

      departure.[11]

This, should then be reported to Vladimir Ilyich and the letter given to
him.  

Signed the letter to

   Münzenberg[12]
[60]

with the reservation that he does not agree to the beginning of the letter
which is incorrectly worded in German. Asked for a copy to be left with him
(No. 8579) in the Secretariat.  

He has a letter to Svidersky to be signed, we have a copy. If he signs
it, it is to be forwarded to

destination.[61] 

Gorbunov has handed in press

      cuttings[13]

;

one folder with fresh material, the other older. These are materials for
Vladimir Ilyich’s speech at the Congress of Soviets, which he asked to be
collected. I think Lydia Alexandrovna should be asked whether it can be
handed to him on Sunday.  

Vladimir Ilyich asked that inquiries should be made of

Belenky[62] as to when (exactly) Rykov and Dzerzhinsky

    

are

      arriving.[14]

He is very interested in this. I have not made inquiries of Belenky.  

Vladimir Ilyich has been told that Frumkin is preparing the material
and will send it in on Monday morning or Sunday

evening.[63] 

Vladimir Ilyich asked Gorbunov several times for Mikhai lovsky’s memo
on the financial question. Nadya IAlliluyeva] must have it. He asked that
both memos, Mikhailovsky’s and

Krasnoshchokov’s[64], should be returned to him when finished with. Left
at 9.30.  

December 3, morning (entry by S. A. Flakserman).


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 2 p.m. Asked for the
stenographer. Volodicheva was not at home, and Vladimir Ilyich said we
shouldn’t trouble to look for her as he did not have much writing to do and
would do it by hand. Reported to Vladimir Ilyich: Belenky’s information
about the arrival of Rykov and Dzerzhinsky, also Kaizer’s report on when
Earsman is leaving. Vladimir Ilyich asked to find out through Voitinsky of
the Comintern, who knows English, when Earsman wants the memo.  

Vladimir Ilyich stayed in his office 20 m. and left.  

December 3, Sunday evening (entry by
S. A. Flakserman).  

Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 6 p.m.  
Belenky reported that according to the information received from the
People’s Commissariat for Railways Rykov left Baku on December 3 and was
expected at Rostov on December 5. A wire has been sent to Dzerzhinsky for
checking. I did not tell Vladimir Ilyich.  

6.45. Vladimir Ilyich asked to tell Avanesov that he received his
letter, read it and would like to talk with him first over the

phone.[65] Pass message on tomorrow morning.  

At 7 p.m. Vladimir Ilyich left his office.  
 

December 4, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 11 .05. Asked to get exact information on
Rykov’s

       arrival.[15]

At 10.40 Vladimir Ilyich phoned to ask that Avanesov be
invited at 11 a.m. Avanesov arrived at 11.15, left at 12.10. Talk was on the
question of foreign trade. At 12.30 Vladimir Ilyich went to Gorbunov’s

office,[66] then came back and began to dictate to Volodicheva over
the, telephone, went home at 2. At 6 p.m. Vladimir Ilyich will be seeing

Kolegayev[67] (telephone 174—14 or through Trotsky’s switchboard).


When Rykov arrives (if Vladimir Ilyich is in the country by that time, he is
leaving on Thursday) he is to be put through to Vladimir

       Ilyich.[16]

At 5.50

Zhukov[68] is to be with Lenin for 10 minutes. From 7 to 8 Frumkin,
from 8.15 to 9 Tsyurupa (tentatively, if this time is inconvenient to Vladimir
Ilyich, then tomorrow at 11 or 12.30 a.m.).


December 4, evening (entry by S. M. Manucharyants).


At 5.30 Vladimir Ilyich dictated to Volodicheva a letter to Litvinov and
greetings to the Third Congress of the Young Communist

International.[69] Dialled and asked me what I have for the day,
told him the schedule of reception. At 5.50 Kolegayev went in, on the closing of
the theatres, up to 6.10. Soon after Zhukov went in With

Holtzmann[70] and Lavrentyev, up to 6.50, talked about electrical
industry. After them Frumkin went in at 6.50 till 7.25 on the question of
foreign trade. At 7.30 Vladimir Ilyich left his office, at 8 o’clock he came
into his office. Vladimir Ilyich asked about Litvinov’s answer. Asked for
Haskell’s wire. Handed over the book by the Spaniard Cesar Reyes, asked
that the inscription and contents of the book be

translated.[71] The
commission made up of Zinoviev, Trotsky and Bukharin met on December 4 (today)
in the evening, to whom was sent a copy of Vladimir Ilyich’s notes
(addressed to

    

Bukharin) on the question of the tasks of our delegation at the

Hague.[72]


At 9 o’clock Vladimir Ilyich left his office.


December 5, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Litvinov reported that there was confirmation of receipt of the telegram by
Haskell through our mission. Tell Vladimir Ilyich.


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 10.45, asked whether the
Bukharin-Zinoviev-Trotsky commission had met. I told him it had that night; he
left at 1.40.


At 6 o’clock Vladimir Ilyich is to receive the Czechoslovak workers (see

list).[73] Orders have to be given to all posts to let them through;
they have passes to the Kremlin (for 15 m.). They have been
notified.

December 6, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office a little after 11. He asked Lydia
Alexandrovna to write several letters on his behalf (to Yakovleva, Kamenev,

Tsyurupa[76]). Asked to be put through to Stalin, made arrangements to
see him. At 12.40 Stalin came, sat with him till 2.20. Asked to invite Eiduk at
7.30,

Dovgalevsky[77] at 6, Bogdanov at 7. After Stalin he wanted to
talk with

    Meshcheryakov.[17]
[78]


At 2.25 Vladimir Ilyich went home, Kamenev phoned, said he was sending a packet
addressed to Comrade Lenin, has to be handed to him

      directly.[18]

 

December 6, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Kamenev’s letter read by Vladimir Ilyich at 6 o’clock.  

From 6.05 to 6.30 Bogdanov; from 6.55 to 7.20 Eiduk; from 7.25
to—Dovgalevsky.  

For 15-20 minutes dictated his reminiscences of N. Y.

Fedoseyev.[79] Left a little after 9. Reminiscences at his request

December 7, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich came to his office at 10.55; at 11 the Politbureau

S. M. Manucharyants).  

Vladimir Ilyich phoned at 5.35, dictated to

Volodicheva[85] at 5.50 Lydia Alexandrovna spoke with Vladimir Ilyich,
who voted on three Politbureau questions: the wire from Vorovsky, Mdivani,
Chicherin dated December 7,

Politbureau.[88] Agrees to putting off the

plenum.[89] Finished speaking at 6.20. Medicine from Berlin sent.  
 

December 9, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


No orders left in the evening. Maria Ilyinichna phoned, saying that
Vladimir Ilyich was going to dictate something at 5.45, and at 6 he was to
talk with Rykov—the latter has arrived and is sitting at home. No
orders. Some packets have come in.  

December 9, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Vladimir Ilyich phoned at 6.05, gave instructions. His letters
concerning the work of the

deputies[90] sent off to Rykov, Stalin, Tsyurupa and Kamenev.  

Belenky is to bring a packet for Vladimir Ilyich from Kamenev.  

Vladimir Ilyich’s letter in French will be returned by Souvarine this

evening.[91] 

Vladimir Ilyich is being sent: 1) his letter on the work of the deputies
(original, copy and copy of the old

decree[92]), letter from Zetkin and medicine.  

December 10, morning.  

Nothing from Vladimir Ilyich.  

December 10, evening.  

Phoned a little after 6, asked to be put through to Stalin. Voted on
the telegram from Kirov, Vasilyev and Poluyan concerning the

S.R.s.[93] 

Send by hand, at first opportunity, Vladimir Ilyich’s letter to Lazzari
in French, corrected by Souvarine; it has been left at the gate; at 8.45

comments.[94] 

Also make inquiries of Gorbunov first thing in the morning (see copies
Nos. 8605 and

8606)[95] 

The letter to Lazzari should not be sent specially. To be sent only by
hand. Vladimir Ilyich said so.  

December 11, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


No orders given. Vladimir Ilyich did not phone once. Check the
temperature in his office, to be no less than 14

degreees. (R.) 

 

December 11, evening (entry by
S. M. Manucharyants).  

There have been no orders. Vladimir Ilyich did not phone once.  

December 12, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


Vladimir Ilyich arrived in Moscow at 11, came to his office at 11.15,
stayed there a short time and went home before 12. At 12 he was to see
Rykov, Kamenev and

      Tsyurupa.[19]


Vladimir Ilyich left his office at 2 o’clock. Rykov, Kamenev and
Tsyurupa sat with him till 2.  

For the evening so far nothing.  

December 12, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Vladimir Ilyich in his office at 5.30. Spoke on the phone for several
minutes. Gave a letter to the Italian Lazzari to be sent off and asked to
see to it that the person taking it was a trustworthy comrade. Dzerzhinsky
from 6 to

6.45.[96] 

Stomonyakov[97]—(question of the foreign trade monopoly)—7.45.  

Left at 8.15.  

Vladimir Ilyich’s letter to Lazzari forwarded to Souvarine (“Luxe”,
23). He will make arrangements with reliable comrades and let us know about
it tomorrow morning, or better still will phone

 him[20]

.  

December 13, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


Doctors came at 11. Ordered complete rest, he was to leave

town[98] 

Round about 12 sent for Fotieva for winding up affairs. Dictated
letters: to the Central Committee concerning

Rozhkov,[99] to Frumkin, Stomonyakov and Trotsky concerning foreign

trade,[100] and to his deputies concerning distribution of

functions.[101] At 12.30 Stalin came, left at 2.35.  
 

December 18, evening (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


At 5.55 sent for Fotieva. Told of Frumkin’s and Trotsky’s
answers. Arranged to see Krzhizhanovsky at 12 on December 14. Dictated,
from 7.30 to 8.25, a letter to the plenum of the Central Committee on the
question of foreign

trade.[102] Wanted to see Frumkin, but cancelled the engagement. Fairly
good humour, joked. Only worried about the winding up of affairs.  

December 14, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


Phoned at 11, spoke with Fotieva about yesterday’s letter on foreign
trade, asked not to give it to anybody, as he had an addition to
make. Inquired whether Krzhizhanovsky was coming. Phoned again at 11.10.


At 1.10 asked to be put through to

Yaroslavsky.[103] As Yaroslavsky could not be found, put off his talk or
interview with him for the evening. At 2.25 sent for Fotieva, gave her a
note for Avanesov to be sent to him together with the letter on foreign

trade.[104] Gave orders for the letter, when returned, to be sent to
Frumkin, whom he would probably receive in the evening. Was very pleased to
hear of the Politbureau’s decision concerning Rozhkov, laughed and said
that this was very good

news.[105] Outwardly in good humour, jokes and laughs.  

December 14, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Vladimir Ilyich phoned at a quarter to six. Asked about the Politbureau
minutes. Said he intended to dictate. Asked to be put through to
Yaroslavsky. (Yaroslavsky was with him). At 7 o’clock, the doctor. Frumkin
came, but did not see Vladimir Ilyich. At a little past eight Vladimir
Ilyich inquired whether he was there. Asked Lydia Alexandrovna to remind
him about Frumkin tomorrow at 12, when Frumkin would be seeing
Tsyurupa. Asked to find out whether all the materials concerning the
foreign trade monopoly had been sent to Trotsky and handed over those he
had been keeping. They have to be shown to Lydia Alexandrovna. Vladimir
Ilyich’s letter concerning Bukharin’s letter has been sent to Stalin and
Trotsky at Vladimir Ilyich’s

       request.[21]
[106]

The addition, as he said, he would write separately.  
 

Before 8 told Lydia Alexandrovna that he would dictate:

1) a letter to Zinoviev concerning Rozhkov in Pskov;

2) to Kamenev concerning the Union of Socialist Republics;

3) an addition to the letter on foreign trade.  

Repeated round about 9 o’clock that he reserved the right to phone up
to 10 o’clock. Round about 10 Maria Ilyinichna phoned and said that
Vladimir Ilyich would not dictate today.  

December 15, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


Phoned at 11.50. Asked for copies of yesterday’s letters. Sent for
Fotieva and gave a letter he had written to Trotsky, telling Fotieva to
type it herself and send it off, keeping a copy in a sealed envelope in the
secret

files.[107] He found it very difficult to write, asked that the original
be destroyed but it is preserved in the secret file together with the copy.


Gave instructions about his books. Technical, medical and other books
to be separated and sent back, books on agriculture to be turned over to
Maria Ilyinichna, those on production propaganda, labour organisation and
pedagogics to Nadezhda Konstantinovna, fiction to be kept until claimed,
and publicist, political books, memoirs, etc., to be kept for him.  

He also gave orders that all the minutes of the Finance Committee be
turned over to him with a memo of the secretary, not too long, but neither
too short, from which he could get a clear idea of the work of the Finance
Committee. Not very cheerful, said he was feeling worse, had not slept that
night.  

December 15, evening (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


Phoned at 8.30. Dictated (first over the telephone, then invited me
over to his flat) letters to Stalin and Trotsky. To Stalin concerning his
possible speech at the Congress of

Soviets.[108] To Trotsky on a categorical protest against the question of
foreign trade being removed from the agenda of the plenum, should that be

contemplated.[109] He finished round about 9.  

December 16, morning (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


At 11-11.45 doctors called (Kramer and

Kozhevnikov[110]).  Nadezhda Konstantinovna sent down the letter to the
deputies

    

which she had taken down, apparently, yesterday evening or today before the
doctors

came.[111]

Pakaln[112] says that Vladimir Ilyich has no wish to go to Gorki, saying
that the journey by aero-sleigh was tiring and you could not go down by
car. Pakaln tells that every day at 9.30 a dog (Aidu) is brought to him
with whom he plays and is very fond of. A telegram has arrived from

Foerster[113] confirming that before addressing the congress he should
have no less than 7 days complete rest. Vladimir Ilyich did not phone once
and has given no orders.  

December 16, evening (entry by L. A. Fotieva).


Nadezhda Konstantinovna phoned asking that Stalin be told in Vladimir
Ilyich’s name that he would not address the Congress of Soviets. On being
asked how Vladimir Ilyich was feeling, she said middling, he looked all
right, but then it was difficult to say. She also asked, on his
instructions, to phone Yarovslavsky secretly and ask him to make notes of
the speeches of Bukharin and Pyatakov, and if possible others at the
plenum, on the question of foreign trade.  

December 18, morning (entry by N. S. Alliluyeva).


A meeting of the Central Committee plenum is on. Vladimir Ilyich is not
attending, he is ill—no orders or instructions.  

December 18, evening.  

The plenum is in session. Vladimir Ilyich is not attending. With the
evening session the plenum is

closed.[114] 

December 23 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

A little after 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me to his flat. In the course
of 4 minutes he dictated. Felt bad. Doctors

called.[115] Before starting to dictate, he said: “I want to dictate to
you a letter to the congress. Take it

down”.[116] Dictated quickly, but his sick condition was
obvious. Towards the end he asked what the date was. Why was I so pale, why
wasn’t I at the

congress,[117] was sorry that he was taking up the time that I could have
spent there. I received no more orders.  
 

December 24 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Next day (December 24) between 6 and 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me in
again. Warned me that what he had dictated yesterday (December 23) and
today (December 24) was strictly confidential. He emphasised this
again and again. Demanded that everything he was dictating should be
kept in a special place under special responsibility and to be considered
categorically secret. He then added another

order.[118] 

Sukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution”, Volumes III and IV, were taken
for Vladimir Ilyich.  

December 29.  

Through Nadezhda Konstantinovna Vladimir Ilyich asked that lists of the
new books be made up. The doctors have allowed him to read. Vladimir Ilyich
is reading Sukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution” (Volumes III and
IV). Vladimir Ilyich is not interested in fiction. He asked that the lists
be made up by sections.  

January 5, 1923.  

Vladimir Ilyich asked for lists of new books as from January 3 and
Titlinov’s book “The New

Church”.[119] 

January 17 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich called me in for half an hour between 6 and 7. He read
and made corrections to his notes on Sukhanov’s book on the revolution. In
the course of 10-15 minutes dictated a continuation on the same

subject[120] 

Was pleased with the new stand that made it easier for him to read
books and his own manuscripts.  

When dictating the sentence

“Our Sukhanovs...” he paused at the words “... never even dream ...”
and while pondering the continuation, jokingly remarked: “What a memory! I
have completely forgotten what I was going to say! Dash it! Extraordinary
forgetfulness!” He asked me to type the notes at once and give them to
him.  

Watching him during dictation for several days running I noticed that
he did not like to be interrupted in the middle of a sentence, as he lost
the thread of his thoughts.  
 

January 18 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me.  

January 19 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me round about 7 and a little after
8. Dictated his second variant about the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection
(“How We Should Reorganise the

W.P.I.”[121]) for about 30 minutes. Said he wished to get it finished as
quickly as possible.  

January 20.  

Vladimir Ilyich called me in today between 12 and 1 o’clock. Read his
article “How We Should Reorganise the W.P.I.” Made amendments and
additions to it.  

Said that Nadezhda Konstantinovna would give him information relating
to one part of his article, and asked Lydia Alexandrovna to find out the
same thing: what and how many bodies there were dealing with the scientific
organisation of labour, how many congresses had been held on the subject
and what groups had been represented at them. Was there any material in
Petrograd?

(Khloplyankin[122] had sent the same material as Nadezhda Konstantinovna
had, a little more detailed.)  

Asked for a full list of

books.[123] I was with him for about 30 minutes.  

January 21 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me.  

January 22 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich called me in for 25 minutes (from 12 to 12.25). Made
corrections in the 2nd variant of the W.P.I. article. Finally chose this
variant. As his time was limited he was in a great hurry. Asked me to put
the article in order, retype it and give it to him by the evening. Nadezhda
Konstantinovna, when letting me in, said he had stolen several minutes to
look through the article. Nadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the nurse
(on duty) had not wanted to let me in to him. After I had left, Nadezhda
Konstantinovna came into the secretariat to tell me Vladimir Ilyich’s
request “to leave a space in the places, if any, which I had not

    

managed to take down”. She said that Vladimir Ilyich, being in a hurry,
imagined that I had difficulty in following him.  I asked him to be told
that I had taken it all down, and if I had any doubts I would do as he had
asked.  

January 23 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me between 12 and 1 o’clock. Once more glanced
through the article mentioned above and made slight changes. Asked me to
insert them in his copy and ours and give one to Maria Ilyinichna for
Pravda. Article corrected and handed to Maria Ilyinichna before
3 o’clock. He asked whether Lydia Alexandrovna had come back and whether
our holidays were over?  

January 30 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Fotieva and gave instructions to
ask Dzerzhinsky or Stalin for the materials of the commission on the
Georgian question and to make a detailed study of them. This assignment was
given to Fotieva, Glyasser and Gorbunov. Object—report to Vladimir
Ilyich, who wanted this for the Party congress. Apparently, he did not know
the question was up at the

Politbureau.[124] He said:

“Just before I got ill Dzerzhinsky told me about the work of the
commission and about the ‘incident’, and this had a very painful effect
upon me.”  

On Thursday, January 25, he asked whether the materials had been
received. I answered that Dzerzhinsky would not be arriving until
Saturday. Therefore I had not yet been able to ask him.  

On Saturday I asked Dzerzhinsky, he said Stalin had the materials. I
sent Stalin a letter, but he was out of town. Yesterday, January 29, Stalin
phoned saying he could not give the materials without the
Politbureau. Asked whether I had not been telling Vladimir Ilyich things he
was not to be told—how was it he was posted about current affairs? For
instance, his article about the W.P. I. showed that certain circumstances
were known to him. I answered that I had not been telling anything and had
no reason to believe he was posted about affairs. Today Vladimir Ilyich
sent for me to learn the answer and said that he would fight to get the
materials.  
 

On January 26 Vladimir Ilyich gave instructions for Tsyurupa, Svidersky
and Avanesov to be told that if they agree with his article, they should
arrange a number of conferences and discuss by way of preparation for the
congress whether or not a plan should be drawn up, a synopsis of textbooks
(apparently on the normalisation of labour). Do they know the books by
Kerzhentsev and

Yermansky?[125] There is a plan of scientific organisation of labour,
there is a normalisation department at the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection.  

Today he asked what answer Tsyurupa had given, whether he, Svidersky,
Avanesov, and

Reske[126] agreed with the article. And other members of the Board?  I
said I did not know this. He asked, wasn’t Tsyurupa dilly-dallying,
procrastinating, was he frank with me. I said I had not had a chance to
speak to him yet, I had only given him the instructions, which he said
would be duly carried out.  

On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich said:

“First of all, about this ‘secret’ job of ours—I know that you are
deceiving me.” To my assurances to the contrary, he answered: “I have my
own opinion about that.”  

Today, January 30, Vladimir Ilyich said that yesterday, on asking
whether he could address the congress on March 30, the doctor had answered
in the negative, but had promised that he would be up by that time and
within a month would be allowed newspapers. Reverting to the question of
the Georgian commission, he said, laughingly:

“That is not newspapers, so I can read it now.”  Apparently not in a bad
humour. No compress on his head.  

February 1 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me (at 6.30 p.m.). I told him the
Politbureau had permitted the materials to be given

out.[127] He gave instructions what to pay attention to and generally how
to use

them.[128] Vladimir Ilyich said:

“If I were at large (at first he made a slip, then repeated, laughing: if
I were at large) I would easily do all this myself.” It had been estimated
that their study would take 4 weeks.  

He asked what the attitude of Tsyurupa and the others was towards his
article. I answered, according to the directions

    

of Tsyurupa and Svidersky, that Svidersky was fully in agreement. Tsyurupa
approved it in the part referring to the enlistment of Central Committee
members, and doubted whether it was possible for the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection to discharge all its present functions with a staff reduced to
300-400 people. I do not know Avanesov’s point of view. Tomorrow there is
to be a meeting of the whole Board.  

He asked whether the question of the article had been up before the
Central Committee. I answered that I did not know this. Vladimir Ilyich was
satisfied with these reports.  

February 2 (entry by M. A: Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me at 11.45. Dictated article “Better Fewer,
But

Better”[129] Finished at 12.30.  

Asked Lydia Alexandrovna to come every other day. When asked,

“At what time”, he said that he was now a free man. Casually mentioned
that the only time that was ruled out was from 2 to 5; said 6 might do, or
to arrange it with his sister.  

I had not seen him since January 23. Outwardly, a considerable change
for the better: fresh, cheerful looking. Dictates, as always, excellently:
without halts, seldom at a loss for words, speaks, gesticulating, rather
than

dictates.[130] No compress on his head.  

February 8 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me at 7 o’clock for a few minutes. Asked
whether we had looked through the materials. I answered that only
externally and that they were less than we had expected. Asked whether this
question had been up before the Politbureau. I answered that I had no right
to talk about it. Asked:

“Have you been forbidden to speak precisely and particularly about this?”

“No, I have no right generally to talk about current business.”

“So this is current business?” I realised that I had made a slip. I
repeated that I had no right to talk. He said:

“I heard about this business from Dzerzhinsky before I got ill. Has the
commission reported to the Politbureau?”

“Yes, it has. The Politbureau has endorsed its decision as far as I
remember.” He said:

    

“Well, I think you will make your report in about three weeks, and then
I’ll send them a letter.” I answered:

“We may not manage it in three weeks.” The doctors came (Foerster, who
had just arrived, Kozhevnikov and Kramer) and I went away. Looked cheerful
and buoyant, perhaps somewhat excited at Foerster’s visit—Foerster had
not seen him for some time.  

February 4 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me today round about 6 o’clock. Asked whether
I did not mind him calling me on holidays. (“You must take a rest, too,
sometimes, mustn’t you?”)  

Dictated continuation of his article “Better Fewer, But Better” for
over half an hour. Looked fresh, voice cheerful. No compress. Ended with
the words:

“Well, that’ll do for the time being. I’m a bit tired.” Asked me to type
it’ out and phone him when I had finished, as he would probably continue
the article that day; said it was an old habit of his to write with the
manuscript in front of him, other wise he found it difficult to write.


Nadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the German doctor (Foerster) had
seen him, had told him a lot of pleasant things, allowed him to do
gymnastic exercises and allowed him extra time for dictating articles, and
that Vladimir Ilyich was very pleased.  

At 8 o’clock he sent for me again. He did not dictate, however, but
looked through what he had written and made amendments. When he had
finished he said that before sending the article to the press he wanted to
show it to Tsyurupa and perhaps some other members of his board and
intended to make certain additions to these thoughts of his. Dictated more
slowly than usual. Compress on his head. Face went pale. Obviously tired.


February 5 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Today Vladimir Ilyich called me in at 12 o’clock. I was with him
three-quarters of an hour. Dictated slowly. In one place, finding
difficulty to express himself, he said:

“It doesn’t go smoothly with me today somehow, not briskly” (he
stressed the word). Asked for his article “How We Should

    

Reorganise the W.P.I.” Read it for 3 or 4 minutes in silence. Then he
continued a little longer and decided to stop, saying he would call me in
today at 4 or 5, maybe 6 o’clock.  

February 5, evening (entry by M. I. Glyasser).


Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna at 7 o’clock (ten to 7),
but as she was indisposed he sent for me.  

Asked whether we had started sorting out the materials of the Georgian
commission and by what date we planned to finish this work. I answered that
we had distributed the materials and begun to read them, and as for the
date, we expected to keep the deadline he had given us, that is, three
weeks. He asked how we intended to read the materials. I said we had come
to the conclusion that it was necessary for each of us to read everything.

“Is that your unanimous decision?”

“Yes.”

Vladimir Ilyich began to figure out how much time was left until the
congress. When I said a month and 25 days, he said that this term was
probably sufficient, but if extra information was required, it might prove
too little, all the more considering that it would take still longer to go
to the Caucasus. He asked how much each of us was working, and said that in
case of need we could use Volodicheva and Shushanika Manucharyants. Then he
asked whether the decision for all to read everything had been formally
adopted. I answered that we had no record of this decision in writing and
asked whether he had anything against it maybe. He said that he would like
us all to read everything, of course, but the tasks of our commission were
very indefinite. On the one hand, he would not like to give us too much
trouble, but on the other, we have to reckon with the need for widening
these tasks as the work progresses. It may be necessary to obtain
additional material. He asked where the materials were being kept, how we
use them, whether we would make a brief summary of all the materials and
whether we would have it typed (“wouldn’t it be too much
trouble?”). Finally, Vladimir Ilyich decided that in the course of the
next week we would decide how much time we needed and in what form we would
handle these materials, and in handling them we would be guided by the
necessity of drawing up a general survey of all the data on the points
which the commission had mapped out as well

    

as on those questions which he would put to us in the course of the work.


Then Vladimir Ilyich ordered inquiries to be made of Popov as to how
things stood with the working up of the census materials of the Central
Statistical Board in Petrograd, Moscow and Kharkov (if a census in the
last-named city was carried out), and by what date he intends to have them
worked up and whether they would be

published.[131] Vladimir Ilyich would like to see them in print before
the Party congress; he considers that in view of the special importance of
this census the materials ought to be published even though those of
previous censuses had not been published and Popov had only sent Vladimir
Ilyich the tables. Popov, therefore, had to be got moving. An official
inquiry should be sent to him about this, following a preliminary talk.


I was with Vladimir Ilyich altogether 20 minutes. I was seeing him for
the first time since his illness. I thought he looked well and cheerful,
only slightly paler than before. Speaks slowly, gesticulating with his left
hand and stirring the fingers of his right. No compress on his head.  

February 6, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich called me in between 7 and 9. I was there for about an
hour and a half. First he began to read his article “Better Fewer, But
Better”. The corrections, made in red ink, put Vladimir Ilyich in a good
humour (not the corrections themselves, but the way they were
inserted!). The article at his request had not been retyped, and the first
deciphered copy had had the corrections added to it which Vladimir Ilyich
had made during his reading. The corrections having been made not in
proof-reader style, but in the ordinary secretarial way, Vladimir Ilyich,
on second reading, found this inconvenient. He asked that the next time the
whole thing should be retyped anew. Running through the article, Vladimir
Ilyich made passing remarks, spoke about his old habit of writing and not
dictating; that he understood now why stenographers do not satisfy him
(“did not satisfy him,” he said); that he was accustomed to seeing his
manuscript in front of him, stopping, pausing to think over difficult
passages, passages in which he had

    

“got stuck”, walking up and down the room, even running away to take a
walk somewhere; that even now he often felt like seizing a pencil and
writing or introducing corrections himself.  

He recollected how he tried to dictate an article of his to Trotsky’s
stenographer back in 1918, and how, when he felt himself getting “stuck”,
he “plunged” on in confusion with “incredible” speed, and how this led
to his having had to burn the whole manuscript, after which he sat down to
write himself and wrote “The Renegade

Kautsky”,[132] with which he was pleased.  

Vladimir Ilyich talked about all this very gaily, laughing his
infectious laugh. I had never seen him in such a mood. He went on dictating
part of this article. Dictation lasted 15-20 minutes. He stopped the
dictation himself.  

February 7 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me. Spoke on 3 questions.  

1) On the results of the census (asked to be shown the proofs of the
census book. I said there would have to be Stalin’s permission for this).


2) On the Georgian commission. Asked how the work was getting on, when
we would finish reading, when we would get together, and so on.  

3) On the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. Did the Board now intend
to make any decision, “to take a step of state importance” or was it
putting things off until the congress. Said he was writing an article, but
was not getting on with it at all, nevertheless he was thinking of revising
it and giving it to Tsyurupa to read before sending it to the press. Gave
instructions to ask Tsyurupa whether he was to hurry up with this article
or not.  

Today Kozhevnikov said that there was a tremendous improvement in
Vladimir Ilyich’s health. He was now moving his arm and had begun to
believe himself that he would regain the use of it.  

February 7, morning (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


I was with Vladimir Ilyich at about 12.30. Said that he would dictate
on any subjects and arrange the material

    

at some future time. Dictated on the subject of

1) how Party and administrative bodies could be merged, and

2) whether it was convenient to combine educational activities with
official activities.  

At the words “And the more abrupt the revolution ...” he stopped,
repeated them several times, obviously struggling with them; asked me to
help him, re-read the preceding pas sages, laughed and said

“Here I’ve got completely stuck, I’m afraid, make a note of that—stuck
on this very spot!"  

To my remark that I was his unavoidable evil for a short space of time,
as he would soon be able to write himself, he said: “Oh, that won’t be so
soon!” His voice sounded weary, with a hint of pain in it.  

February 7, evening (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Vladimir Ilyich called me between 7 and 9. Was with him for about an
hour and a half. Completed the sentence at which he had stopped
yesterday. Said:

“I shall now try to develop the next subject.” There and then asked about
the subjects he had already noted

previously[133] when these were read out, he remarked that one of them he
had forgotten (on the correlation between the Central Board for Vocational
Education and the general educational work among the people). Dictated the
general part of his article “Better Fewer, But Better”. Dictated fast and
freely, without difficulty, gesticulating.  

On finishing, said he would try later to fit this part in with his
article as a whole. Tired. In the evening I learned from Nadezhda
Konstantinovna that Vladimir Ilyich would not dictate tomorrow; he intended
to read.  

February 9 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

In the morning Vladimir Ilyich sent for me. Confirmed that he would
move the question of the Workers’ and Peasant’s Inspection at the
congress. As for the census, he was worried whether the tables would be
printed the way they should be. Agreed to my suggestion that instructions
for having this checked should be put through Kamenev or Tsyurupa. The
assignment to be given to Krzhizhanovsky or Svidersky. Mood and appearance
excellent. Said that Foerster was inclined to allow him to receive visitors
rather

    

than newspapers. On my remarking that this really would seem to be. the
best from the medical point of view, he said very gravely after a
thoughtful pause that in his opinion it would be worse precisely from the
medical point of view, because printed matter could be read and done with,
whereas visits evoke an exchange.  

February 9, morning (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).


Vladimir Ilyich called me in a little after 12. Said the retyped stuff
pleased him better. Read the part of the article he had dictated yesterday,
made practically no corrections. On finishing, said:

“I think I’ve made a good job of it.” I had the impression that he was
very pleased with that part of his article. Asked me to take down the end:

“That is how I link up ...", etc. I stayed for about an hour.  

February 9, evening.  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna. Nadezhda Konstantinovna
asked her to be given the general part of the article, as Vladimir Ilyich
wanted her to read it.  

February 10 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Called me in a little past 6. Asked that the article “Better Fewer,
But Better” be given to Tsyurupa to read, if possible within 2 days.  

Asked for listed

books.[134] Looks tired, speaks with great difficulty, losing the thread
of his thoughts and confusing words. Compress on his head.  

February 12 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Vladimir Ilyich is worse. Bad headache. Called me in for several
minutes. According to Maria Ilyinichna, the doctors had upset him so much
that. his lips quivered. Foerster the day before had said that he was
emphatically prohibited newspapers, visitors and political
information. Asked what he meant by the latter, Foerster replied:

“Well, this, for example. You are interested in the census of Soviet
employees.” The fact that the doctors knew about this upset Vladimir
Ilyich. Apparently, furthermore, Vladimir Ilyich had the impression that it
was not the doctors who gave

    

instructions to the Central Committee, but the Central Committee that gave
instructions to the doctors.  

Talked with me about the same 3 subjects, pleaded a headache. I said
jokingly that I would treat him by suggestion and in two days he would have
no more headaches.  

February 14 (entry by L. A. Fotieva).  

Vladimir Ilyich sent for me a little after 12. No headache. Said that
he was quite well. That his was a nervous illness, that sometimes he felt
quite well, i.e., his head quite clear, but sometimes he felt
worse. Therefore we had to hurry with his requests, as he wanted to put
some things through without fail in time for the congress and hoped that he
would manage it. But if we dragged it out and thus ruined the business, he
would be very very annoyed. The doctors came and we had to break off.  

February 14, evening.  

Called me in again. Impediment in speech, obviously tired. Spoke again
on the three points of his instructions. In special detail on the subject
that agitated him most of all, namely, the Georgian question. Asked to
hurry things up. Gave certain

instructions.[135] 

March 5 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me until round about 12. Asked me to
take, down two letters: one to

Trotsky,[136] the other to

Stalin[137] the first letter to be telephoned personally to Trotsky and
the answer given to him as soon as possible. As to the second latter, he
asked it to be put off, saying that he was not very good at it that day. He
wasn’t feeling too good.  

March 6 (entry by M. A. Volodicheva).  

Asked about a reply to the first letter (reply over the telephone was
taken down in shorthand). Read the second letter (to Stalin) and asked it
to be handed to him personally and receive the answer from his own
hands. Dictated a letter to the Mdivani

group.[138] Felt bad. Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked that this letter to
Stalin should not be sent, and it was held up throughout the 6th. On the
7th I said I had to

    

carry out Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions. She spoke to Kamenev, and
the letter was handed to Stalin and Kamenev, and afterwards to Zinoviev
when he got back from Petrograd. Stalin’s answer was received
immediately on receipt of Vladimir Ilyich’s letter (the letter was
handed to Stalin personally by me and his answer to Vladimir Ilyich
dictated to me). The letter has not yet been handed to Vladimir Ilyich, as
he has fallen

ill.[139]

The Journal of Lenin’s Duty Secretaries contains records of
Lenin’s orders and instructions, reception of visitors and other facts from
November 21, 1922 to March 6, 1923.  


The entries in the Journal were made by Secretary of the C.P.C. and the
C.L.D. L.A. Fotieva, Assistant Secretary of the C.P.C. and the
C.L.D. M.A.Volodicheva, secretaries N. S. Alliluyeva, M. I. Glyasser, and
S. A. Flakserman, and Lenin’s librarian S. M. Manucharyants.  
 The office book for registering outgoing mail was used for the
Journal. Four columns were ruled off in it: date, who was on duty, orders
and instructions, and notes on execution. The title page had the
inscription:

“Please write in this book all orders and instructions and all happenings
during duty hours with a note regarding execution of orders. 21/XI—22.”





[23]
Gorbunov, N. P.—Business Manager of the Council of People’s
Commissars.





[24]
This refers to the meeting of the C.P.C. at which Lenin presided.





[25]
On November 21 the members of the Politbureau voted on the proposal
made by the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs G. V. Chicherin
that the Envoy Plenipotentiary of the R.S.F.S.R. in Italy V. V. Vorovsky be

[28]
See present edition, Vol. 33, p. 444.





[29]
Twenty-one questions were dealt with at this meeting of the
Politbureau, among them: the Moscow conference of the R.S.F.S.R., Poland,
Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania; reduction of armaments; the trusts;
a joint society for the sale of platinum; agricultural loans; and questions
relating to the People’s Commissariat for Education.





[30]
Sklyansky, E. M.—Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Republic.





[31]
Sokolnikov, G. Y.—Deputy People’s Commissar for Finance.





[32]
Lenin was sent a draft resolution for the Fourth Congress of the
Comintern “A Rough Draft of an Agrarian Programme of Action” drawn up by
E. Varga and a note from the Comintern

   

Executive asking for his opinion on the draft. Lenin sent his remarks on
the morning of November 25.





[33]
For Lenin’s correspondence with Stalin on the ship-repair programme see
Collected Works, Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 311–13.





[34]
Earsman, and Garden, John S.—delegates to the Fourth
Congress of the Comintern from the Communist Party of Australia.





[35]
The members of the Politbureau voted on Chicherin’s proposal that the
Soviet Government send a note to the sponsors of the Lausanne Conference
concerning the participation of the Soviet delegation in the conference
proceedings and of Soviet representatives in the deliberations of the
Commission on the Straits.





[36]
At the meeting of the Council of Labour and Defence chaired by Lenin
thirteen questions were examined, among them: draft regulations on the
Committee for Internal Trade; report of the C.L.D. Commission on the
preparation of materials for the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets;
importation of grain to Turkestan to support the cotton industry.





[37]
The voting was on the decision of the Secretariat of the C.C.,
R.C.P. dated November 24 appointing a commission composed of
F. E. Dzerzhinsky (chairman), D. Z. Manuilsky and V. S. Mitskevich-Kapsukas
to urgently examine the statement by members of the C.C. of the Communist
Party of Georgia, who had handed in their resignations on October 22, and
to propose measures for establishing a durable peace in the C.C. of the
Georgian Communist Party. Lenin abstained from voting.





[38]
That day the doctors ordered Lenin a week of complete rest.





[39]
Lenin dictated a letter to Stalin on the ship-re p air programme (see
Collected Works, Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 311- 42); a
letter to Trotsky (copies to Zinoviev, Bukharin, Radek, Stalin and Kamenev)
about a letter to the Italian delegates to the Fourth Congress of the
Comintern and about Trotsky’s theses on N.E.P. (see Collected
Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 314); a letter to Trotsky,
Zinoviev, Bukharin and Radek criticising the “Rough Draft of an Agrarian
Programme of Action” (ibid., p. 313). The same day Lenin also ordered his
signature to be put to a letter of greetings to the Fourth All-Russia
Congress of the Educational Workers’ Union (see present edition, Vol. 33,
p. 445).





[40]
This apparently refers to the Comintern Executive’s letter to Lenin
asking him to receive a number of delegations to the

   

Fourth Congress of the Comintern and Stalin’s letter concerning measures
for combating the illicit trade in platinum. The same day Lenin instructed
Gorbunov to circulate among all members of the Politbureau a draft decision
on measures for combating the illicit trade in platinum. See also the
interview with Lenin by Michael Farbman, correspondent of the
Observer and Manchester Guardian (present edition,
Vol. 33, pp. 388–89).





[41]
Lenin asked his C.P.C. and C.L.D. deputy Tsyurupa to take part in the
work of the Politbureau commission appointed to draw up draft regulations
on the trusts. On November 27 the Politbureau included Tsyurupa in the
commission.





[42]
Apparently this refers to the articles published in Pravda on
February 2, 1923, in connection with the Soviet Government’s refusal to
conclude a concession agreement with Urquhart, the English industrialist.





[43]
The report of V. P. Milyutin, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Economic
Council, on questions of trade, finance and industry was sent to Lenin as
material for his report to the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets.





[44]
Münzenberg, W.—Secretary General, Foreign Committee for
the Organisation of International Workers’ Aid to the famine-stricken
people of Soviet Russia.





[45]

[142]
The supplementary card said: “Supplementary to the materials on the
question of foreign trade monopoly, asked for the minutes of the meeting
presided over by Lezhava and others—list of automatic telephone
numbers. All taken to his fiat. Gave Lydia Alexandrovna instructions for
Frumkin, Lezhava and Tsyurupa in connection with the materials on foreign
trade monopoly. Talked on the phone with Frumkin, Gorbunov and
others. Looked through the C.L.D. agenda.” The same day Lenin was sent the
minutes of the meeting of the C.L.D. Commission on Internal Trade held on
October 13.





[46]
M. Sorokin, “Nash promyshlenny Komsostav” (“Our Industrial
Captains”) (Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, November 26, 1922). The entry
wrongly gives the date as November 27.





[47]
Apparently Lenin was interested in the proposals and conclusions of the
C.P.C. Commission on the inspection of R.S.F.S.R. trade agencies
abroad. V. A. Avanesov, vice chairman of this commission, sent Lenin these
materials on December 3 (see entry for December 3, evening).





[48]
Bogdanov, P. A.—Chairman, Supreme Economic Council.





[49]
Fomin, V. V.—Deputy People’s Commissar for Railways.





[50]

[51]
At its meeting on November 30 the Politbureau heard the report of the
Commission of the C.C. plenum on the “Union of Republics” and adopted the
basic principles of the U.S.S.R. Constitution.





[52]
See Collected Works. Vol. 45, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 312-13.





[53]
On November 30 the Politbureau endorsed the decision of the C.C.’s
Orgbureau of November 20 to convene the plenum of the C.C. on December 15.





[54]
This refers to the article “A Talk with Peshekhonov”.





[55]
Adoratsky, V. V.—a scholar, prominent propagandist of
Marxism. At Lenin’s request, prepared a volume of selected letters of
K. Marx and F. Engels.





[56]
F. Engels, Political Testament (Unpublished Letters). Moscow,
1923. The Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism- Leninism has
a copy of this book that belonged to Lenin with his note to the librarian:
“Keep on the shelf. 30/XI. 1922. Lenin” (see Biblioteka
Lenina v Kremle [Lenin’s Library in the Kremlin], Moscow, 1961,
p. 56).





[57]
Syrtsov, S. I.—member of the staff of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)





[58]
Knipovich, N. M.—professor, head of the Azov Expedition,
whose main object was to make a general survey of the Azov Black Sea Basin
for fish industry revival.





[59]
Apparently Lenin is referring to the article by F. Kin (Frumkin)
“Specialists (An Essay at Statistical Survey)” published September 3,
1922 in Pravda No. 197.





[60]
See present edition, Vol. 35, pp. 559–60.





[61]
The letter to A. I. Svidersky, Member of the Board of the People’s
Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, was signed by Lenin

Belenky, A. Y. —member of the staff of the State Political
Administration (G.P.U.).





[63]
On Lenin’s instructions M. I. Frumkin, Deputy People’s Commissar for
Trade and Industry, drew up a report “Brief

   

Materials on the State of Foreign Trade”, which he sent in on December 4.





[64]
This refers to A. G. Mikhailovsky’s memorandum on the country’s

On December 4 Gorbunov wrote in the book of orders:

“Be posted on Kyshtym Works affair, prepare basic figures concerning the
financing of the metallurgical industry, ditto the Donbas and Azneft, study
the system of working up census data” (apparently the census of Soviet
employees in Moscow and Petrograd, carried out in October-November

p. 61).  

On returning to his office Lenin dictated a letter to I. I. Khodorovsky
asking for information concerning patronage by urban cells of the
R.C.P. over village cells and vice versa (see Collected’ Works,
Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 315–16). Lenin intended to mention
this in his report to the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets (see present
edition, Vol. 36, p. 589). He dealt with this in his article “Pages From a
Diary” (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 465–66).

agricultural loans, the wage fund for December 1922, the reports at the
Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, the question of N. A. Rozhkov, member
of the C.C. of the Menshevik party, and other questions.





[81]
Fotieva sent the following note to A. M. Nazaretyan:

“Vladimir Ilyich suggests that Unschlicht’s four proposals on the question
of issuing credentials to deportees should be adopted.”  I. S. Unschlicht,
Deputy Chairman of the G.P.U., proposed that the People’s Commissariats

[82]
Lenin asked Yakovleva to keep him informed about the work of the

December 7 to prepare the calculations for fully providing the pupils and
teachers of all the schools with bread (see p. 429 of this volume).





[83]
Before leaving for Gorki, Lenin also left written orders to Gorbunov
and Fotieva on the manner in which he was to be informed of any documents
coming in from the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.) (see Collected Works,
Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, p. 318). Lenin instructed his secretaries
to send Tsyurupa and Rykov his proposals of December 4 concerning
distribution of functions among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the
C.L.D. (see pp. 428–29 of this volume).





[84]
The minutes of the Politbureau meeting on December 7 were sent to Lenin
after his talk with Fotieva, who informed him of the decisions the
Politbureau had adopted after his departure.





[85]
Lenin dictated to Volodicheva a letter to Stalin protesting against the
decision of the Politbureau concerning Rozhkov and pro posing that this
question be referred to the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.). The letter also
dealt with the work of S. A. Lozovsky in the Profintern (see Collected
Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 320–21).





[86]
The telegram referred to asked permission for the Soviet delegation at
the Lausanne Conference to declare that the Soviet Government agreed to a

[89]
The C.C., R.C.P.(B.) plenum, scheduled for December 15, was put off to
December 17.





[90]
This evidently refers to Lenin’s proposals concerning the distribution
of functions among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. (see
pp. 430–32 of this volume) and his letter concerning the routine work of
the deputies and chairman of the C.P.C. (ibid., pp. 430–32).





[91]
This refers to Lenin’s letter to Lazzari (see Collected Works,
Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 322–23). Boris Souvarine—delegate to
the Fourth Congress of the Comintern; Lenin, in this instance, used his
services as a translator.

[93]
The voting was on the Politbureau’s decision (on the telegram of
December 7) concerning the sentence in the trial of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries in Baku. Lenin voted “for”. The Politbureau
decided on December 14 not to object.





[94]
Frumkin’s comments on the theses of the C.P.C. Commission concerning
the inspection of R.S. F.S.R. trade agencies abroad were received on
December 11 and reported to Lenin on December 13.





[95]
The mail registration book had down Lenin’s letter to Frumkin under
No. 8605. Under No. 8606 were instructions to Gorbunov to prepare for Lenin
by Tuesday (December 12) the proofs of the book Na Novikh
Putyakh. Itogi novoi ekonomicheskoi politiki 1921-1922. Trudi pod
redaktsiei komissii STO (On a New Path. Results of the New Economic
Policy for 1921-1922. Papers edited by the C.L.D. Commission). Moscow,
C.L.D. Publishing House, 1923 (Instalment II, Finances, Instalment III,
Industry).





[96]
Dzerzhinsky informed Lenin of the results of the Politbureau
Commission’s trip to Georgia to investigate the conflict between the
Transcaucasian Committee and the Mdivani group. Lenin recalled this talk on
January 24, 1923 (see p. 484 of this volume).





[97]

in Moscow. ^^See also Note 584 in this volume.^^





[100]
Lenin stated in his letters that he was unable to attend the
forthcoming plenum of the C.C. He expressed his views on how his stand on
the question of the foreign trade monopoly should be defended at the plenum
and emphasised that vacillation on this question was inadmissible.





[101]

R.C.P.(B.) on the question of the foreign trade monopoly and send his
suggestions (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition,
p. 325).





[105]
On December 14, the Politbureau revoked its decision of December 7 and
resolved to banish Rozhkov to Pskov, warning him that at his first
anti-Soviet act he would be sent out of the country.





[106]
This refers to Lenin’s letter to the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.),
concerning the monopoly of foreign trade (see present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 455–59).





[107]
In this letter Lenin expressed the hope that the plenum would adopt a
decision confirming the unalterable principle of the foreign trade
monopoly, since some of those who had voted against the monopoly at the
October plenum had adopted a correct stand (see Collected Works,
Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 325–26).





[108]
See present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 460–61.





[109]
In his letter Lenin stressed the need for having the question of the
foreign trade monopoly discussed at the plenum of the C.C. and having it
raised at the next congress of the Party (see Collected Works,
Vol. 54, Fifth Russian Edition, pp. 325–26).





[110]
On the night of December 16 Lenin’s health took a sharp turn for the
worse. Paralysis of the right arm and right leg set in. Then he began
gradually to recover the use of his arm and leg.  

Kozhevnikov, A. M.—Neuropathologist in attendance on Lenin.





[111]
In this letter Lenin expressed his views on the distribution of duties
among the deputy chairmen of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D., and on the need for

monopoly. The plenum adopted a special decision for him to be informed, by
arrangement with his doctors, of the plenum’s resolution and report.





[115]
On the night of December 23 paralysis of the right arm and right leg
set in.





[116]
Lenin dictated his Letter to the Congress of the Party on December 23,
24, 25, 26, 29, 1922 and January 4, 1923 (see present edition, Vol. 36,
pp. 593-97, 603-04). The letter dictated on December 23 was forwarded to
Stalin by the secretariat the same day.





[117]

(from December 23 to 27, 1922).





[118]

“All the articles and documents,” Volodicheva wrote rater, in 1929,
“which Lenin dictated between December 1922 (the 20th) and the beginning
of March 1923 were typed at his request in five copies, one of which he
asked to leave for him, three copies to be given to Nadezhda
Konstantinovna, and one to his secretariat (strictly secret). The copy to
be sent to Pravda retyped fair with all his final corrections and
changes was looked through by Lenin, after which it was passed on to Maria
Ilyinichna. The three copies that Nadezhda Konstantinovna had received were
also corrected. The rough copies were burnt by me. He asked that the sealed
envelopes in which the copies of the documents were kept should be marked
to the effect that they could only be opened by V. I. Lenin, and after his
death by Nadezhda Konstantinovna. I did not write the words ‘and after his
death’ on the envelopes. Lenin’s copies were kept in a file and corded for
more convenient use.”





[119]
B. V. Titlinov, Novaya Tserkov (The New Church), Petrograd,
Moscow, 1923. After the corresponding entry in the “Books Issued

[127]
On February 1 the Politbureau allowed the materials of the Dzerzhinsky
Commission on the Georgian question to be given out.





[128]
Fotieva wrote down the following instructions of Lenin:

“1) Why was the old C.C. of the C.P. of Georgia accused of deviationism.

2) What breach of Party discipline were they blamed for.

3) Why the Transcaucasian Committee is accused of suppressing the C.C. of
the C.P. of Georgia.

4) The physical means o suppression (‘biomechanics’).

5) The line of the C.C. (of the R.C.P.(B.)— Ed.) in Vladimir
Ilyich’s absence and in his presence.

6) Attitude of the Commission. Did it examine only the accusations against
the C.C. of the C.P. of Georgia or also against the Transcaucasian
Committee? Did it examine the ’biomechanics’ incident?

7) The present situation (the election campaign, the Mensheviks,
suppression, national discord)” (Central Party Archives, Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.).





[129]

[130]
On February 2, through Krupskaya, Lenin asked for the following books
to be obtained for him from M. P. Pavlovich: A. Y. Khodorov. Mirovoi
imperializm i Kitai (Opit Polit.-ekonom. issledovaniya) (World
Imperialism and China. An Essay at Politico-Economic Research). Shanghai,

Yaponia (Soviet Russia and Imperialist Japan). These books were
delivered to Lenin in the evening together with A. M. Khinchuk’s book
Tsentrosoyuz v usloviakh novoi ekonomicheskoi politiki
(Centrosoyuz Under the New Economic Policy), Moscow, 1922.





[131]
This refers to the census of Soviet employees carried out in Moscow and
Petrograd in October-November 1922.





[132]
This refers to Lenin’s “The Proletarian Revolution and the
Renegade Kautsky”.





[133]
Apparently, on December 27 or 28 Lenin dictated his note on the
subjects of his future work: 

“Memo: 


“The letter about increasing the number of Central Committee members
omits mention of the ratio of the members of the enlarged Central Committee
to the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.  

“Subjects to be dealt with: 

“1. Centrosoyuz and its significance in the light of the NEP.

recent conflict in the Georgian party).  

“4. The new book of public education statistics published in 1922.”





[134]

[135]
Fotieva wrote down the following:

“Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions that a hint be given to Soltz
(A. A. Soltz, member of the presidium of the Central Control Commission,
R.C.P.(B.)—Ed.) that he (Lenin) was on the side of the injured
party. Some one or other of the injured party was to be given to understand
he was on their side.  
 “3 moments:

1. One should not fight.

2. Concessions should be made.

3. One cannot compare a large state with a small one.  

“Did Stalin know? Why didn’t he react?  

“The name ‘deviationist’ for a deviation towards chauvinism and
Menshevism proves the same deviation with the dominant-national
chauvinists.  

“Collect printed matter for Vladimir Ilyich."  

Between February 15 and March 4 no entries were made in the Journal.





[136]
Lenin asked Trotsky to uphold the “Georgian case” at the plenum of
the C.C. Trotsky, pleading illness, said he could not take upon himself
such an obligation (see Collected Works, Vol. 54.  Fifth Russian
Edition, p. 329).





[137]
This refers to Lenin’s letter to Stalin, copies of which were sent to
Kamenev and Zinoviev (see Collected Works, Vol. 54, Fifth Russian
Edition, pp. 329–30).





[138]
Lenin stated in this letter that he was preparing a memorandum and
speech on the Georgian question (see Collected Works, Vol. 54,
Fifth Russian Edition, p. 330).





[139]
At this point the entries break off.  

The text beginning with the words:

“Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked...”  is written in the Journal in
shorthand; this was deciphered by Volodicheva on July 14, 1956.
