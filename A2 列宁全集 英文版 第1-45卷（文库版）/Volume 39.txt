## Struggle Against the
      “Marsh”





Lenin: 1916/ni-alpha: OUTLINE FOR AN ARTICLE ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE 'MARSH'






Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
NOTEBOOK âÎ±â
(âALPHAâ)



       OUTLINE FOR AN ARTICLE ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE âMARSHâ
   

(NOTES ON KAUTSKYISM)[1]


Our Struggle Against the âMarshâ


TheMarsh = K. Kautsky, Huysmans, etc.


Significanceof the distinction between Plekhanov, Hyndman, Heine and K. Kautsky, Vandervelde, etc. 2 distinctions of âshadesâ. Eclectics instead of dialectics. The âmiddle wayâ: âreconciliationâ of extremes, absence of
    clear, definite, firm conclusions; vacillation.


Conciliation and blunting of class contradictions in words
    and their accentuation in reality.


Conciliation with opportunism.


Glossing over the theoretical and practical-political differ-
    ences with opportunism.


Repudiation (apostasy) of the Road to Power position and
    of the revolutionary essence (and revolu-
    tionary tactics) of the Basle Manifesto[2]....


The difference between the conceptions âMarxist centreâ (=independent policy, independent ideas, independent theory) and âMarshâ (=wavering, lack of principle, âturn tableâ (âDrehscheibeâ), weathercock).





 Illegal organisation.
    Work in the army.
    Support for and devel-
     opment of mass
     action. 
N.B.


 Official optimism:
 the objective course of
 events ... everything is
 bound to be for the best.
The âproletariatâ and the
 âclass struggleâ âin generalâ.
 



âProcessâ


 


 
 N.B.


 cf. Martov on the âhopeless-
       nessâ of socialism if ...
       opportunism is hopeless!!! 





Recognition of revolutionary activity along the lines indicated above, not denial of legal activity and of the struggle for reforms, should be the essence of the âstruggle against the Marshâ.


The possibility of a fusion of socialism and syndicalism, should there be a new and deeper division.


Parliamentarism and a different conception of it. âIllegal parliamentarismâ.


Notes

[1] The article on the struggle against the âMarshâ (Notes on Kautskyism) was apparently never written. p. 30


[2] This refers to Kautskyâs pamphlet Der Weg zur Macht (The Road to Power), published in Berlin in 1909. Lenin called it Kautskyâs âlast and best workâ against the opportunists.


The Basle Manifesto on war was adopted by the Extraordinary Congress of the Second International in Basle, November 24-25, 1912. It exposed the predatory aims of the war the imperialists were preparing and called on the workers of all countries to wage a vigorous struggle for peace, against the threat of war, and âto oppose to capitalist imperialism the power of international proletarian solidarityâ. Should imperialist war break out, it said, socialists must take advantage of the economic and political crisis it will cause so as to advance the socialist revolution (see present edition, Vol. 21 pp. 208-17 and 307-08). The leaders of the Second International (Kautsky, Vandervelde, etc.) voted for the Manifesto at the Congress, but consigned it to oblivion and supported their imperialist governments when the war broke out. p. 30

     RAVESTEIJN ON THE BALKAN PROBLEM
   

W. van Ravesteijn, âThe Balkan Problemâ, Die Neue
Zeit,
    1913 (31st year, Volume I). November 15, 1912.





N.B.




âSuch a federationâ (of Balkan countries, including Turkey)
âwould be able to satisfy the cultural needs of this geographically
integral area and to erect an insurmountable barrier to the advance of
European
imperialism, and also of Russian world power. All other solutions of the
Balkan problem can be only of a temporary nature and cannot for long satisfy the
interests of all the races and nations that live thereâ (p. 228).




 




âA federation of all the Balkan countries will natu-
rally be resisted by European imperialism and tsarism
with all their strength. Their common interest, now as
in the past, is aggravation of mutual enmity and rivalry
between these nations and Turkey so as the more easily
to exploit their territories as colonial spheres. Will
the statesmen of Turkey and the Balkan countries
come to realise their common interests and put an
end to this murderous war by entering into close
relations with one another? If they fail to do this,
they will sacrifice the interests of their peoples to
European capitalism and the interests of the Balkan
dynastiesâ (p. 229).

âIn the Ruhr mining industry the interests, of the
whole nation come into conflict with the interests of
a quite insignificant number of capitalists, who number
hardly one hundredâ (p. 144).






















Incidentally, this article deals with the question of
whether or not the syndicate will be renewed. Consult
Conradâs chronicle for this period (October-December
1912, etc.).

## Frankfurt Metal
      Trade





Lenin: 1916/ni-alpha: LIEFMANN ON THE FRANKFURT METAL TRADE






Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
NOTEBOOK âÎ±â
(âALPHAâ)



   LIEFMANN ON THE FRANKFURT METAL TRADE
   

Robert Liefmann, âThe International Organisation of the Frankfurt Metal Tradeâ. Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, Vol. I. Jena, 1913, p. 108 et seq.


The Merton concern grew out of the enterprises of Merton (Anglo-German family).








âProbably more than 200 million marks have been invested in the Merton concern as a whole, not counting, of course, the private property of the capitalists behind itâ (p. 121).




âThrough its enterprises, particularly those of the Merton concern, the Frankfurt metal trade which, incidentally, includes also some other firms of considerable importance, embraces, therefore, virtually the whole worldâ (p. 122).


Diagram (p. 120) (town names added): [see p. 37 âEd.]


Trading capital (of Merton) has passed here into productive capital.


âThe characteristic feature of modern wholesale trade in almost all its branches is its penetration into productionâ (p. 111).





After the electrical industry (Allgemeine ElektrizitÃ¤ts Gesellschaft in Germany, the General Electric Company in the U.S.A., etc.), probably âthe most international branch of enterprise in Germanyâ (109) is the trade in metals (especially copper, zinc, lead, and rare metalsâthe chief centre of which is Frankfurt).


The present head, Dr. Wilhelm Merton (member of the board of most of the companies), is in Frankfurt. His father, Henry R. Merton, is in London.


The chief difference between all these companies and other similar ones is that the capitalists at the head of the business still have a direct (p. 119) part in all trading and production enterprises. They âsupplementâ their capital by capital from the public.


Of course, the number of âcompaniesâ in which they have âholdingsâ is immeasurably greater than shown in the diagram.

 BOURGEOIS SCIENTISTS ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM
   

N.B.  Bourgeois scientists on the struggle against
   imperialism;


âNationalities and subject races.â


Report of the conference held in the Caxton Hall, Westminster, June 28-30, 1910. London, 1911 (xii + 178 pp.).


Review in Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, Vol. II, p. 193, signed H. J. Nieboer (Hague). The author of the review notes that the report contains brief speeches by representatives âof various peoples living under foreign rule: Egyptians, Indians, Moroccans, Georgians, Negro races of Africa, South American Indians, and also European nations such as the Irish and Polesâ (p. 194).














âWe are told that we must fight imperialism; that
the ruling states should recognise the right of subject
peoples to independence; that an international tri-
bunal should supervise the fulfilment of treaties con-
cluded between the Great Powers and weak nations.
They do not go further than expressing these pious
wishes. We see no trace of understanding of the fact
that imperialism is inseparably bound up with capi-
talism in its present form and that, therefore, an
open struggle against imperialism would be hopeless.
unless, perhaps, it is confined to protests against
certain of its especially abhorrent excessesâ (p. 195).[1]








N.B.
















N.B.

It is significant that the bourgeois âimperialistsâ in Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv keep track of the national liberation movements in the colonies (at least the non-German ones).[2]


For instance, Vol. III, 2


the ferment and protests in India (p. 230)


idem in Natal (Africa) owing to restrictions on the immigration of Indians (230-31).


Vol. IV, 1, p. 130âthe movement for self-government in the Dutch Indies.[3]

Sigmund Schilder. âWorld-Economic Background of the
   World Warâ. Weltwirtschaftliches Archly. Vol. 5 (I)

A very good outline (Germanophile, of course).


The transition of other countries to protectionism caused


Britain in the 19thâ20th century to pass to plans for war.


  Austria. Her Balkan aspirations.




Interesting to note: in Serbia(at the time of 
the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) in 1908-09 
there were voices in favour of war with Austria-Hun-
gary on the following grounds. If we win, we shall
take the Serbs away from Austria-Hungary. If we
are defeated, Serbia will be included in the customs
frontier of Austria-Hungary. That would suit us too.
We have nothing to lose (p. 11).








!!

N.B.




For Russia  > âfirst and foremostâ âthe private economic advantage of the military-bureaucratic ruling classâ (12). Exception: the drive for the Dardanelles.


In France dissatisfaction over the Morocco-Congo agreement of November 4, 1911.




Belgium can retain her Congo only with the help 
of Britain; the agreement of February 5, 1895 gave
France âfirst optionâ to the purchase of the Congo
(p. 16).










N.B.




Japan aims at domination over China.


Turkey prior to 1913 was âan object rather than a subject of world politicsâ (19).


Portugal is dependent on Britain.


Spain (by the November 27, 1912 treaty with France) obtained a northern portion of Morocco (France was against, Britain was in favour). Spain has gone a long way in the 16 years, 1898-1914.

(âALPHAâ)



 KESTNER, COMPULSORY ORGANISATION


Dr. Fritz Kestner, Compulsory Organisation.


A Study of the Struggle between Cartels and Outsiders, Berlin,
1912.


A systematic study of conflicts between cartels and âoutsidersâ and
within cartelsâand methods of âstruggleâ:


1) Stopping supply of raw materials....

 2) Stopping supply of labour by means of alliances....

 3) Stopping deliveries....

 4) Closing trade outlets....

 5) Binding purchasers by exclusive agreements.

 6) Systematic price cutting.

 7) Stopping credit....

 8) Boycott.[1]


[From Inquiry into Cartels (5 vols. 1903-06) and others.]


A host of examples. Very detailed examination of the state and
legal significance....


âThe Rhine-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, at its foundation in 1893,
concentrated 86.7 per cent of the Rhine-Westphalian coal output ... in
1910â95.4 per cent
     (p. 11)....[2]

The United States Steel Trust in 1911â45 per cent of the output of
pig-ironâ.... (Other examples: 98 per centâ85 per cent, and so on.)


âThe entry of a particular enterprise into a cartel is a business act
decided by considerations of profit. Like the operation of cartels in
general, its implications are felt mainly in periods of
depression. Conflicts between cartels and outsiders arise chiefly because
of the differing impact restriction of trade outlets, the inevitable result
of the cartel activity, has on individual enterprises. Restriction of trade
outlets has a particularly severe impact on enterprises capable of
expansion, which is why their resistance is the strongestâ
(pp. 25-26)....


...âThe difference between the two conceptsâ (cartel and trust) âis
really one of ownership: various owners in the cartel, only one in the
trustâ (p. 53 and a reference to Liefmann).


âIt has been repeatedly establishedâand this can be regarded as a
general phenomenonâthat the profitability resulting from cartelisation
attracts new entrepreneurs and new capital into the industryâ (57). For
example, the Potassium Syndicate raised prices. Result:






in 1879


there were

(p. 57)








 Provisions concerning higher prices for outsiders
sometimes take the form of lower discounts for them
(p. 73)....

 The BuchhÃ¤ndler BÃ¶rsenvereinâforbade the sale of
books âtodealers selling at bargain pricesâ (84).

 âStopping the supply of materials, along with binding
purchasers by means of exclusive agreements, which
will be dealt with below, must be regarded as one
of the most important means of compelling entry
into the cartelâ (91)....









...Export subsidies... (107).  

âdependent tradersâ organisations are set upâ
(109)... 


(coalâparaffin....)


Price cutting.... There were cases of benzine prices being reduced from
40 to 20-22 marks (118)âof alcohol in Upper Silesia to 49.5 marks (in
Breslau the price is 62.2 marks)....  

Credit refusal: Phoenix declined to join the Federation of Steel
Plants. The director of the firm was against joining. The banks bought up
its sharesâwithdrew its export subsidiesâand secured a vote in favour
of joining at a meeting of shareholders!! (pp. 124-25).  

Agreements with members within the cartel .... (penalties;
arbitration courts instead of general courts)....  

The best means of controlââjoint sales officeâ (153)....  

âJeidels (p. 87 of his book) is undoubtedly right that the foundation
of a new big independent bank in Germany would be impossibleâ (p. 168).


âEven in the purely economic sphere a certain change is taking place
from commercial activity in the old sense of the word towards
organisational-speculative activity. The greatest success no longer goes to
the merchant whose technical and commercial experience enables him best of
all to estimate the needs of the buyer, and who is able to discover and, so
to speak, âawakenâ a latent demand; it goes to the speculative genius who
knows how to estimate, or even only to sense in advance, the organisational
development and the possibilities of certain connections between individual
enterprises and the banks...â
      (p. 241).[3]








 âThe heads of the big firms are able at any time
to enlist the services of the most learned and skilful
lawyers, and if they themselves are not highly versed
in commercial matters, they can enlist the aid of
outstanding businessmen. It is common knowledge
that the central offices of big enterprises employ
a whole number of persons who have no relation to
the undertaking as such, including even a doctor of
political economy for economic propaganda on behalf
of the firmâ (p. 242).  
















!!










 The formation of cartelsâand this has been estab-
lished in the case of those formed so farâleads to an
alteration of prices, and also incomes, in favour of
heavy or raw-materials industry and to the detriment
of manufacturing industry. The prolonged raising
of prices which results from the formation of cartels
has hitherto been observed only in respect of the
most important means of production, particularly
coal, iron and potassium, but never in respect of manu-
factured goods. Similarly, the increase in profits
resulting from this raising of prices has been limited
only to the industries which produce means of produc-
tion. To this observation we must add that the indus-
tries which process raw materials (and not semi-
manufactures) not only secure advantages from the
cartel formation in the shape of high profits, to the
detriment of the finished goods industry, but have
also secured a dominating position over the latter,
which did not exist under free competitionâ (p. 254).[4]






N.B.
 
 
 
 
 
 




























Cartels, says Kestner, do not always lead to concentration (they may
ârescueâ small establishments joining the cartel), but the cartel always
leads to âintensification of capitalâ (274) ... to an enhanced role of
rich, big-capital enterprises (272 and 274).  

Regarding the importance of cartels one should not overlook, Kestner
says, the difference between an organisation, say, of consumers (this is
socialism, p. 282), and an organisation of manufacturing or raw-materials
industries.  

âThe present situation, the dependence of a much bigger section of
industry on the output of raw materials, has a certain superficial
resemblance to it [to a union of consumers,
etc.][5]

but internally it is the exact oppositeâ (p. 282). ((Liefmann, he says,
constantly overlooks this differenceânote, p. 282.))


âIt is a matter of dispute whether cartels have led to an improvement
of the workersâ position, as is asserted by some and contested by others,
and whether they embody a co-operative democratic principleâ
((Tschierschky!!  The
author rejects that view: note, p. 285)), âor whether they indicate,
precisely in the case of Germany, an anti-democratic attitude, owing to the
shift to heavy industry which is hostile to the trade unionsâ (285)....

of capital from the United States in loans

The country whose capital is invested in
a South American country is going to get
the most of the contracts for materials used in
construction enterprises, railway building, and
the like, as well as the contracts for public
improvements carried on by the governments.

Englandâs investments in Argentine railways, banks and
loans are the living evidence of this factâ (314)....

states: âAs we learn from the notice you pub-

bility that the next general meeting of your
syndicate, to be held on the 30th of this

likely to effect changes in your enterprise
which are unacceptable to us. We deeply
regret that, for these reasons, we are obliged
henceforth to withdraw the credit which
has hitherto been allowed you. Accordingly,
we ask you to cease requests for money
from our bank and at the same time we respect-
fully ask you to return not later than the end
of the current month the sums owing to us.
But if the said next general meeting does not
decide upon measures which are unacceptable
to us, and if we receive suitable guarantees on
this matter for the future, we shall he quite
willing to open negotiations with you on the
grant of a new creditâ[4] (146-47).

N.B.: p. 161:




 âIn Germany there have been a very large
number of mergers that are not (???) of a monop-
olistic nature.... A typical exampleânot to cite
numerous instances from a more remote periodâ
is the gunpowder industry. Already in the seven-
ties, 19 gunpowder factories merged in a single
joint-stock company. In 1890, this merged
with its most powerful rival to form the Verei-
nigte KÃ¶ln-Rottweiler Pulverfabriken. This big
joint-stock company then formed cartels not
only with other gunpowder factories, but also
with the dynamite trust mentioned above.

The number of industrial cartels in Germany (1905) was 3 8 5 (in reality more: p. 25).[2]


N.B.  |||| Riesser (p. 137), in quoting these statistics, adds: âabout 12,000 firms participated âdirectlyâ in these cartelsâ. Riesser, The German Big Banks and Their Concentration, 3rd edition, Jena, 1910.



The number of international cartels (with German participation) is about 100 (p. 30: in 1897 it was about 40).[3]

In 1908, the biggest firm in the German mining industry, Gelsenkirchner Bergwerksgesellschaft, had 1,705 employees + 44,343 workers (wagesâ70.5 million marks).

(173, etc.) âInterlockingâ, âholdingsâ (passim), âabolishing isolationâ (p. 155)âthese are Liefmannâs âcatch-wordsâ for avoiding (and obscuring) Marxâs concept of âsocialisationâ.[4]

Marxâs concept of âsocialisationâ, based on a scientific analysis of the objective laws of development of capitalist society, points to the necessity and inevitability of the means of production passing from private capitalist ownership to social ownership. Lenin showed that the conflict between the production relations and the productive forces under capitalism becomes very acute in the era of imperialism. In this last stage of capitalism the concentration and socialisation of production reach the highest level (see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 205, 207, 302-03). This makes it easier, after the victory of the socialist revolution, for the workersâ and peasantsâ state to take over the basic means of production and organise planned production in the interests of the people. p. 56

 âOnce the supreme management of the
German banks has been entrusted to the
hands of a dozen persons, their activity is
even today more significant for the public
good than that of the majority of Ministers
of Stateâ (145-46).[1]

âIf, however, this is so, then the national
welfare requires the development of a new
spiritual type of bank magnate whose abstract
[ha-ha!] urge for profit is permeated by
national-political and therefore national-eco-
nomic considerations....










âIf we imagine the development of those
tendencies we have noted carried to their
logical conclusions we will have: the money
capital of the nation united in the banks; the
banks themselves combined into cartels; the
investment capital of the nation cast in the
shape of securities. Then the forecast of that
genius Saint-Simon will be fulfilled: âThe
present anarchy of production, which corres-
ponds to the fact that economic relations are
developing without uniform regulation, must
make way for organisation in production.
Production will no longer be directed by iso-
lated manufacturers, independent of each
other and ignorant of manâs economic needs;
that will be done by a certain public insti-
tution. A central committee of management,
being able to survey the large field of social
economy from a more elevated point of view,
will regulate it for the benefit of the whole
of society, will put the means of production
into suitable hands, and above all will take
care that there be constant harmony between
production and consumption. Institutions al-
ready exist which have assumed as part of their
functions a certain organisation of economic
labour, the banks.â We are still a long way
from the fulfilment of Saint-Simonâs forecast,
but we are on the way towards it: Marxism,
different from what Marx imagined, but
different only in form!â (146)[2]

âOf course, investments like those made by
Britain, e.g., in the Suez Canal, on the basis
of her political powerâthe shares were bought
in 1876 for Â£4 million and today are worth
Â£30 millionâare still unattainable for Ger-
manyâ...(159-60).

p. 164 quotes J. Lewin, German Capital in Russia, St. Petersburg, 1914.







 âThe economic function of the banks is the
already much discussed management
of the national property [a refer-
ence to Lansburghâs article in the magazine
Die Bank, 1908]. Today, the greater the devel-
opment of credit operations, the greater
becomes the share of the total capital going
to entrepreneurs chosen by the bank. The
banks now provide the channels through which
flow not only annual savings but also previous-
ly accumulated (and continually renewed)
capital. One recalls, above all, the enormous
growth of âborrowed moneyâ. In our joint-
stock banks in Germany these deposits amount-
ed to about 1,280 million marks at the end
of 1891; to about 6,305 million marks at the
end of 1906; at the present time they are
estimated at approximately 10,000 mil-
lion marks.

 âAt the end of 1913, deposits of the nine big
Berlin banks alone were about 5,100 million[3]
marks. At the same time, however, the
banks act as channels for still larger move-
ments of capital in dealings in stock. In
this matter, even if there is good will, they
may make mistakes; they may direct thousands
of millions into the wrong channel and,
under certain circumstances, lose. At the
present time a few big banks can to a certain
extent determine the course of our econo-
mic development. Hence their economic
responsibility to the shareholders becomes
a national economic responsibility in relation
to the state as a whole. They do, in fact,
direct capital into industrial and commercial
channels, primarily into the giant enterprises
of heavy industry, and also into real estateâ
formerly into the estates of the nobility
but nowadays into the leasehold houses of the
big cities. Hence the rapid progress of the
German iron industry, which is second only to
America, and of the German big cities, which
are overtaking even their American proto-
typesâ (p. 12)....

âDemocratisationâ of banking!![14] Compare the one-pound shares in Great Britain and the minimum of 1,000 marks in Germany (p. 111).[4] The average size of a bill of exchange in Germany = 2,066 marks (State Bank); in France it is 683 francs (Banque de France).




âG. von Siemens declared in the Reichstag
on June 7, 1900, that the one-pound share
was the basis of British imperialismâ (p. 110).[5]






 N.B.







âThe British industrial state is based less
on credit than the German, and more on its
own capitalâ (55).









âEven today, Great Britain, as the international intermediary for payments, is said to earn about 80 million marks annually as commission on acceptances. It is said that 6,000 million marks are paid annually through Great Britain for the overseas trade of Europeâ (83).



p. 100: Â§ entitled âThe Banksâ Domination over the Stock Exchanges?ââThis is said to be an exaggeration but âtheir [the banksâ] influence is far-reachingâ....
















âWhile formerly, in the seventies, the Stock
Exchange, flushed with the exuberance of
youth, opened the era of the industrialisation
of Germany, taking advantage of the opportu-
nities offered by shares, nowadays the banks
and industry are able to âmanage it aloneâ.
The domination of our big banks over the
Stock Exchange, which is bound up with
contango businessâbut not only with thisâ
is nothing else than the expression of the
completely organised German industrial state.
If the domain of automatically functioning
economic laws is thus restricted, and if
the domain of conscious regulation by the
banks is considerably enlarged, the national
economic responsibility of the few directing
individuals is immensely increasedâ (101).[6]

 In the Â§ on âspeculation in securitiesâ
(p. 111 et seq.), instead of exposing
speculation by the banks ((cf. the magazine
Die Bank, Eschwege and others)), the scoun-
drel Schulze-Gaevernitz gets out of it by
phrases: âIf our banks were speculative compa-
nies ... it would mean ... the collapse of the
German national economyâ (112)... ((âifâ))...
saves the âproprietyâ of our âbusiness worldâ,
and our bank officials are forbidden to spec-
ulate in alien banks (of course, he says,
this can be easily circumvented!! in large
cities) ...but what about bank direc-
tors? For they are âin the knowâ (âWissen-
denâ)!! Here, he says, legislation is of no avail,
what is needed is âstrengthening of the com-
mercial sense of honour and standingâ (113)....

âAt the end of 1909, the nine big Berlin
banks, together with their affiliated banks,
controlled 11,300,000,000 marks, that is,
about 83 per cent of total German bank
capital. The Deutsche Bank, which together
with its affiliated banks controls nearly
3,000,000,000 marks, represents, par-
allel to the Prussian State Railway Admin-
istration, the biggest and also the most
decentralised accumulation of capital in the
Old Worldâ (137)....[7]

Agreements between banks: the DarmstÃ¤d-

with the city of Berlin on ârevenue-useâ of
the Tempelhof area, at a 10 per cent profit.
Later, when the Deutsche Bank made this
dealâthe DarmstÃ¤dter Bank was found to be
in its consortium!! (p. 139)....  âBank consor-
tiums of this kind tend to make price agree-
mentsâ....

âNevertheless, the âgeneral agreementsâ con-
cluded in the summer of 1913 go so far that,
after their implementation, there can hardly
be any further talk of free competition in
bankingâ... (139)...

forefront of this evolution (151).[8] In the gigan-

...âThe Frankfurter Zeitung (May 2, 1914)
greeted the fusion of the Discontogesellschaft
with the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein with
the following words:

ââThe concentration movement of the banks
is narrowing the circle of establishments
from which it is possible to obtain credits,
and is consequently increasing the dependence
of big industry upon a small number of bank-
ing groups. In view of the close connection
between industry and the financial world,
the freedom of movement of industrial com-
panies which need banking capital is res-
tricted. For this reason, big industry is
watching the growing trustification of the
banks with mixed feelings. Indeed, we have
repeatedly seen the beginnings of certain
agreements between the individual big bank-
ing concerns, which aim at restricting com-
petitionââ (p. 155).[9]

154-55: The question is: who is more
dependent on whom, the banks on industry
or vice versa?...

where capital wealth is increasing and the

Quoting facts confirming âexport stipulationsâ and the benefit accruing to industry from foreign investments, Schulze-Gaevernitz says, incidentally, that France also benefits from this:




âThe French rentier state is thus experienc-
ing a second industrial floweringââthe float-
ing of the Turkish loan in 1910 was made
conditional on Turkey not giving to any coun-
try more orders than to France... (p. 163).

âGermany today is a typical âentrepreneur
operating abroadâ, whereas France, and grad-
ually also Britain, are becoming ossified as
rentiers.... Though the world of today has an
Anglo-Saxon countenance, our banks, by
means of railways, mines, plantations, canals,
irrigation works, etc., are working to give
this countenance traits of the German spiritâ

âa) The creditorâ states: France, Great Brit-
ain, Germany. Great Britain and France,
the two big creditor powers of the world, are
political bankers. The state and the banking
community act as one and the same person.
Such is the French Government and the
CrÃ©dit Lyonnais. Such is the friendship of
Edward VII and Sir E. Cassel. Hoping to
win the main prize in the political lottery,
France staked thousands of millions of francs,
on the Russian card alone. Russia, by obtain-
ing money from France, was even able to act
as a political loan giver in the Far Eastâ
in China and in Persia. France, as a loan
giver, had a hold over Spain and Italy, and
as her clients they helped her in Algeciras.
France was prepared to extend to the Kossuth
ministry loans she refused to Count Kuehn:
âthe earnest-money would have been the
Triple Allianceâ. As a political creditor,
Great Britain cemented afresh the British
world empire, without fear of pressure on the
current value of her Consols. The guaranteed
safety afforded colonial state loans in the
metropolis enabled, for example, such a half-
opened-up new country as Natal to enjoy cheap-
er credit than long-consolidated, highly
respectable Prussia with her gigantic property
in railways and state lands. This credit
nexus is a âbond of interestsâ, stronger, per-
haps, than Chamberlainâs preferential tariffs
would ever have been. Going beyond the
imperial connections, the British creditor keeps
Japan in political vassalage, Argentina in
colonial dependence, and Portugal in uncon-
cealed debt bondage. The governors of Portu-
guese Africa, for all their gold braid, are
British puppetsâ (165)....












...âThe total [of German capital in Russia]
is estimated at 3,000,000,000. The preference
shown by our banks for this greatest of all
the debtors in world history is understandable
if one bears in mind the high bank profits
from Russian securitiesâ (166).

âThere can be no doubt, that, in their
efforts for political and economic independ-
ence, the semi-civilised countries not yet
allotted as colonies cannot receive from any
European power such unselfish support as
from Germany. China, Persia and Turkey
know that Germany has no territorial claimsâ
(167).

âThe German banks abroad everywhere
encountered the competition of the long-
established British âforeign banksâ, which
even today far surpass them in volume of
business and size of share capitalâ (173)....

...âAll the more soberly, therefore, must we
regard the fact that we have arrived late on
the scene. The activity of the German foreign
banks can be likened to the highly promising
steps of an eager youth from whom the greater
part of the world has been barred by its for-
tunate possessor. Hardly a single German
banking establishment is from be found in the
British Empire, to say nothing of the French
and Russian empires, and yet it is claimed
that the Britisher rules the world in the inter-
ests of all. The future of German foreign
banking depends largely on solving a political
problem: keeping of an open door to the still
uncolonised countries, rebirth of the Moslem
world, creation of a German colonial empire
in Africaâ... (174).

From Th. Vogelsteinâs article âFinancial Organisation of
Capitalist Industry and Formation of Monopoliesâ.




âTen years after May 9, 1873, when, in
SchÃ¶nlankâs exaggerated expression, the bells
tolled the death of the economic boom and
the birth of cartels, Fr. KleinwÃ¤chter pub-
lished his book on cartelsâ (216). 












N.B.








From the history of cartels: 



âIsolated examples of capitalist monopoly
could be cited from the period preceding 1860;
in these could be discerned the embryo of
the forms that are so common today; but all
this undoubtedly represents the prehistory
of cartels. The real beginning of modern
monopoly goes back, at the earliest, to the
sixties. The first important period of develop-
ment of monopoly commenced with the inter-
national industrial depression of the seventies
and lasted until the beginning of the ninetiesâ
(222).  










N.B.










âIf we examine the question on a European
scale, we will find that the development of
free competition reached its apex in the sixties
and seventies. It was then that Britain com-
pleted the construction of her oldâstyle
capitalist organisation. In Germany, this
organisation entered into a fierce struggle
with handicraft and domestic industry, and
began to create for itself its own forms of
existenceâ (ibidem). 












N.B.
















âThe great revolution commenced with the crash of 1873, or rather, the
depression which followed it and whichâwith hardly discernible
interruptions in the early eighties, and an unusually violent but
short-dived boom about 1889âoccupies twenty-two years of European
economic historyâ (222)....  

...âDuring the short boom of 1889-90, the system of cartels was widely resorted to in order to take advantage of favourable business conditions. An ill-considered policy sent prices soaring more rapidly and steeply than would have been the case if there had been no cartels, and nearly all these cartels ended ingloriously in the âgrave of bankruptcyâ. Another five-year period of bad trade and low prices followed, but a new spirit reigned in industry. The depression was no longer regarded as something to be taken for granted; it was regarded merely as a pause before another boom.




second
epoch
of
cartels










âThe cartel movement entered its second
epoch: from a transitory phenomenon, the
cartels became one of the foundations of econo-
mic life. They were winning one industry after
another, primarily, the industries processing
raw materials. By the early nineties the cartel
system had already acquiredâin the organi-
sation of the coke syndicate, on the model
of which the coal syndicate was later formedâ
a cartel technique which has hardly been
improved on. For the first time the great boom
at the close of the nineteenth century and
the crisis of 1900-03 occurred entirelyâin the
mining and iron industries at leastâwithin
a cartel economy. And while at that time it
appeared to be something novel, now the
general public takes it for granted that large
spheres of economic life have been, as a general
rule, removed from the realm of free compe-
titionâ (224)....[13]




























N.B.














Forms of cartels:

a) Cartels fixing sales conditions (terms, time limits,
  payment, etc....)
 b) Cartels fixing the sales areas
 c) Cartels fixing output quotas
 d) Cartels fixing prices
 e) Cartels fixing distribution of profit


Syndicateâsingle sales office (Verkaufsstelle)


Trustâownership of all enterprises

Lenin refuted the apologetic inventions about the âdemocratisationâ
of capital as far back as 1902. He conclusively showed that individual
workers acquiring small shares do not become owners of joint-stock
enterprises, âpropertiedâ people. The ones who profit from the issue of
small shares are the big shareholders of the capitalist monopolies and
joint-stock companiesâthey use for their enrichment even the very small
crumbs of the peopleâs savings

(see present edition, Vol. 6, p. 96).

p. 61



[15]
In the Notebooks and Imperialism, the Highest Stage of
Capitalism, Lenin exposes the bourgeois-apologetic nature of
âorganised capitalismâ, an unscientific theory that seeks to prove that
imperialism is a special, transformed capitalism which has abolished
competition, anarchy of production and economic crises, and has achieved
planned economic development. This theory, advanced by the ideologists of
monopoly capitalismâSombart, Liefmann, etc.âwas seized upon by Kautsky,
Hilferding and other reformist theoreticians of the Second
International. Lenin demonstrated that monopoliesâ rule, far from
abolishing, intensifies competition and anarchy of production, and does not
rid the capitalist economy of crises

(see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 208).

p. 62



[16]
In his study of imperialism, Lenin showed that political reaction in
all aspects of home and foreign policy is the political superstructure of
monopoly capitalism. Imperialism, he pointed out, is the negation of
democracy in general

(see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 43).

Monopoly capitalism curtails or nullifies even formal bourgeois democracy,
and establishes its unlimited dictatorship.  

The characteristic features of imperialist for policy are aggression,
violation of the national sovereignty of weak and dependent countries.

(Ibidem, p. 713). Note on âBanks and
the Post Officeâ. The boundary between
the banks and the savings banks âis
being increasingly obliteratedâ. Hence
complaints by the banks. The
Erfurt Chamber of Commerce speaks in
favour of the banks against the ârecent
intervention of the post office in cur-
rency circulationâ (in the form of the
âissue of postal letters of creditâ). The
editors remark that postal letters of
credit operate only within the German
Empire, whereas bank letters of credit
serve mainly persons going abroad, and
âafter all, the public exists not only
for the sake of the banksâ (714).

this ânot onlyâ
is magnificent!!!)




From the article âThoughts on the Thousand Million Loanâ, p. 932: âA subscriber to the loan possesses liquid assets, but mostly in the form not of cash, but of a bank account or a savings bank, association, etc. deposit. In Germany these institutions control, in round figures, 35,000 million marks of such liquid assets, about half of which are at the immediate disposal of their owners, while the other half are available to them after preliminary notificationâmostly after a monthâ (933).


What is involved is the transfer of ownership from private personsâ accounts to the stateâs account (and vice versa in paying suppliers, etc.).


The credit institutions as a whole dispose of ânot more than 500 million marksâ, on the basis of âtheir total cash and deposits in the State Bankâ (933).


In 1871, France paid 5,000 million in such a way that only 742.3 million was paid in gold, silver and banknotes, the remainder (4,248.3 million) being in bills. (France recovered so rapidly in 1870-71 because she did not tamper with her currency and made no excessive issue of âuncovered banknotesâ.)


p. 903 et seq.: âThe Ousting of London as the Worldâs Clearing Houseâ by Alfred Lansburgh.


A very good article, explaining the causes of Britainâs power. The chief cause: âthe absolute predominance of British trade and currency circulation over the trade of all other countriesâ (909). It exceeds German trade âby 50 per cent in round figuresâ (ibidem). In addition, there is the trade with the colonies!!




N.B.






âBritain accounts for three-quarters of
world tradeâ (910). 




âThis means that three-quarters of all international payments pass directly or indirectly through Great Britainâ (910).


âSterling accountsâ âpredominateâ also in Japan, China, Chile, Peru, South Persia, âthe greater part of Turkey (910).ââKnowledge of English is widespread in commercial circlesâ (910).


Furthermore, Britain finances this trade of the whole world (the lowest rate of interest; the most stable gold currency; one pound sterling = 7 1/3 grams of gold, etc., etc.).


Great Britainâs âvastâ monetary resources, her 60 colonial banks (911), etc., etc.


The maxim of a bank director (the Bank of Brazil), KÃ¤mmerer(a German):




(913) âThe first essential for opening an overseas
banking establishment is credit, an accepting banker
in London.â  






N.B.!
















p. 912, note: âRegarding the difficulties encountered
by German overseas banks in introducing bills of exchange
in marks in South America, cf. JaffÃ©, British Banks,
second edition, 98-101, Frankfurter Zeitung, August 29,
1914; Hamburger Nachrichten, September 15, 1914â (I omit
other quotations).










âFor every country adopting a currency based on gold and holding, as occurs almost everywhere, a large portfolio of British bills of exchange in place of gold, not only subordinates a greater part of its international payments to the London Clearing House, but thereby also immediately assists the consolidation of British world financial power. The continual holding of a large portfolio of British bills of exchange means, in practice, that the country in question puts considerable resources at Londonâs disposal, which for its part London can, and does, use to further finance the foreign trade of other countries and in this way strength en its own sterling currency and its own clearing function. Thus, owing to the gold value of the pound sterling, Great Britain is always able to put at the service of her credit system, besides her own large capital assets, also several thousand million marks of foreign moneyâ (913-14).


To deprive Britain of this role requires âhuge financial resources and a low rate of interestâ (916)... âAnd one must be in a position not only to pay out vast sums of money, but also to guarantee the absolute stability of the currency that is to replace the British, that is, one must be prepared at any time to pay in gold.â


Hence, the term âutopianâ is applied to the plan of the National City Bank (Morganâs Bank)[16] or the Swiss banks, âwhich believe that a little good will is quite sufficient to wrest from London the international clearing accounts, or a considerable part of them. That is indeed a highly desirable aim, but it cannot be achieved until some other country can put at the service of world trade the amount of credit, the complex of commercial, banking and interest advantages, and the reliable currency foundation, which, prior to the outbreak of the war at least, Britain put at the disposal of world tradeâ (920)....




(1914, November and December.) âThe Covering
   of War Costs and Its Sourcesâ, an article by Alfred
   Lansburgh.


Quotes Lloyd George as saying (in September 1914): âIn my judgement, the last few hundred millions may win this war. This is my opinion. The first hundred millions our enemies can stand just as well as we can, but the last they cannot, thank God...â (p. 998).


Says Lloyd George is mistaken. There are four sources for covering war costs: (1) âFirst degreeâ reserves = cash (France and Russia have more than Germany, but Britain less. Here Germany is weaker). (2) âSecond degreeâ reserves: short-term debt claims in world trade (Britain is much stronger: âWhereas Britain is the worldâs banker and keeps her money liquid, France is the worldâs financier and invests her moneyâ) (1001). (3) Net income from the countryâs production + (4) part of gross income devoted to depreciation (or accumulation). Here, he says, we are not weaker.


In this connection, however, Lansburgh is counting on exports which though secret (âhiddenâ), will not disappear.


Our (Germanyâs) low discount rate proves (December 1914!!!), he says, that exports are inadequate, do not correspond to âour expenditure abroadâ (1103).




N.B.






Cf. p. 1112: âOnly when exports suffice fully to
cover imports and war expenditure abroad will the
national economy be really on a war footing.â






1914, 1 (May). âThe Bank with 300 Millionâ, an article by
   A. Lansburgh.


The Discontogesellschaft swallowed up the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein and increased its share capital to 300 million marks (p. 415).[2]


âThus for the first time a really big German bank has become a victim
of the concentration processâ (415).  

The Deutsche Bank increased its capital to 250,000,000 marks. The Discontogesellschaft replied to this by a âmergerâ with the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein and increased its capital to 300,000,000.[3]


âWith a capital of 300,000,000 marks, it becomes, for the time being, the biggest bank not only in Germany, but in the worldâ (422).


The âstruggle for hegemonyâ, which had seemed decided in favour of the Deutsche Bank, now flared up afresh:








âOther banks will follow this same path ... and
the three hundred men, who today govern Germany
economically, will gradually be reduced to fifty,
twenty-five, or still fewer. It cannot be expected that
this latest move towards concentration will be con-
fined to banking. The close relations that exist between
individual banks naturally lead to the bringing
together of the industrial syndicates these banks
favour. This, and business fluctuations, will lead to
still more mergers, and one fine morning we shall
wake up in surprise to see nothing but trusts before
our eyes, and to find ourselves faced with the necessity
of substituting state monopolies for private monopolies.
However, we have nothing to reproach ourselves
with, except that we have allowed things to follow
their own course, slightly accelerated by the manipula-
tion of stocksâ (426).[4] (End of article.)

âSUBSIDIARY COMPANIESâ, an article by Ludwig Eschwege, p. 544 et seq. (May 1914).


Early in 1912, the big banks (yielding to the pressure of the State Bank) introduced a new type of balance-sheet. But thousands of joint-stock companies continue to publish brief (âknappeâ) balance-sheets, not going beyond the requirements of the lawâthe brevity of the balance-sheet being alleged to be a guarantee against speculation!!! In fact, however:






âIn reality, what is achieved by this [the âbrevity
of balance-sheetâ] is merely that a few better-informed
persons are able to enrich themselves at the expense of the
mass of shareholders, especially if brevity is combined
with a subtle system of misleading headings to make
important data invisible to the ordinary shareholder.
This gives the directors and their good friends a double
advantage: being sole possessors of all information, they
can benefit from a rise in market values in favourable
situations, and escape anticipated losses by a timely sale
of shares in unfavourable ones.
























good
example!






âThus, for example, the Spring-Steel Com-
pany of Kassel was regarded some years ago
as being one of the most profitable enterprises
in Germany. Through bad management its
dividends fell in a few years from 15 per
cent to nil. It appears that the Board, without
consulting the shareholders, had loaned six
million marks to one of its âsubsidiary com-
paniesâ, the Hassia Company, which had
a nominal capital of only some hundreds of
thousands of marks. This commitment, amount-
ing to nearly treble the capital of the âparent
companyâ, was never mentioned in its balance-
sheet; this omission was quite legal and
could be hushed up for two whole years
because it did not violate any point of com-
pany law. The chairman of the Supervisory
Board, who as the responsible head had
signed the false balance-sheets, was, and
still is, the president of the Kassel Chamber
of Commerce. The shareholders learned of
the Hassia loan only much later, after it had
been proved to be a mistake and when Spring-
Steel shares dropped nearly 100 per cent,
because those in the know were getting rid
of them. It was only then that the item in
question was made evident by a change in
the method of drawing up the balance-sheet.
This typical example of balance-sheet juggle-
ry, quite common in joint-stock companies,
explains why their Boards of Directors are
willing to undertake risky transactions with
a far lighter heart than individual business-
men. Modern methods of drawing up balance-
sheets not only make it possible to conceal
the risky deal from the ordinary shareholder,
but also allow the main interested parties
to escape the consequence of an unsuccessful
experiment, by selling their shares in time,
whereas the individual businessman risks
his own skin in everything he doesâ (545)....








!!!




















N.B.




















âThe balance-sheets of many joint-stock companies
remind us of the palimpsests of the Middle Ages from
which the visible inscription had first to be erased in
order to discover beneath it another inscription giving
the real meaning of the documentâ (545)...


â














A palimpsest is a parchment from which the original
inscription has been erased and then another inscrip-
tion imposed.




â












...âThe simplest and, therefore, most common proce-
dure for making balance-sheets indecipherable is to
divide a single business into several parts by setting up or
attaching âsubsidiary companiesâ. The advantages of
this system for various purposesâlegal and illegalâ
are so evident that today big companies which do not
employ it are quite the exceptionâ[5] (545-46).












This assures âa certain impenetrability of their operationsâ (ibidem)....


An outstanding example is the Allgemeine ElektrizitÃ¤ts Gesellschaft (with thousands of millions of marks in subsidiary companies)....

Authorâs italics: âSubsidiary companies are an ideal
means for compiling objectively false balance-sheets
without contravening the provisions of company lawâ
(549).  




âThe decisive factor is that the modern system of arranging balance-sheet items makes concealment possibleâ (ibidem)....


Another example:


The Oberschlesische Eisenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft (pp. 550-51) has in its balance-sheet âholdingsâ = 5,200,000 marks.


What holdings? The author ascertained privately: 60 per cent are shares of the Gleiwitzer Steinkohlengruben
 (and this company has debts of 20,000,000 marks!!)

for the most part these statistics (in the Frankfurter

âTransport Trustâ, a note in Die
Bank, 1914, 1, p. 89.
The formation is expected (perhaps in the
near future) of a Berlin âtransport trustâ, i.e.,
an interest-community of the three Berlin
transport companiesâthe elevated railway,
tramway, and omnibus companies. We have
been aware that this plan was contemplated
ever since it became known that the majority
of shares in the omnibus company had been
acquired by the other two transport compa-
nies.... We may fully believe those who are
pursuing this aim when they say that by
uniting the transport services they will have
economies, part of which will in time benefit
the public. But the question is complicated
by the fact that behind the transport trust
that is being formed are the banks, which,
if they desire, can subordinate the means of
transportation, which they have monopolised,
to the interests of their real estate business.
To be convinced of the reasonableness of
such a conjecture, we need only recall that
the interests of the big bank that encouraged
the formation of the Elevated Railway Com-
pany were already involved at the time the
company was formed. Indeed, the interests
of this transport undertaking were interlocked
with the real estate interests and so an essen-
tial prerequisite for the foundation of the
transport company was created. The point
is that the eastern line of this railway was
to run across land which, when it became
certain that the railway was to be construct-
ed, this bank sold at an enormous profit
for itself and some persons associated with
it in the land company at the SchÃ¶nhauser
Allee railway station.[9] For it is common
knowledge that land development, and the
resultant rise in land prices, is best achieved
by means of new transport routes.â (There
follows yet another example: no less than
eleven lines already run to the Tempelhof
area. Too many? The reason: many directors
and members of Supervisory Boards live
there!!!  p. 90.)... âA transport monopoly
involves a real estate monopoly....â

âThe Oil Comedyâ, Die Bank, 1913, No. 4 (p. 388).


Excellent note, reveals the essence of the struggle for monopoly of oil in Germany.






Before 1907. âUntil 1907 the Deutsche Bank
oil concern was engaged in a sharp conflict
with the Standard Oil Companyâ (389).
The outcome was clear: defeat of the Deutsche
Bank. In 1907, two courses were open to it:
either liquidate its âoil interestsâ and lose
millions, or submit. It chose the latter and
concluded an agreement with Standard Oil
(ânot very advantageousâ to the Deutsche
Bank). The Deutsche Bank undertook ânot
to attempt anything which might injure
American interestsâ, but... the agreement
would cease to operate with legislation estab-
lishing a German oil monopoly.
And then Herr von Gwinner (a Deutsche
Bank director), through his (private) secre-
tary (Stauss) (Die Bank, 1912, 2, p. 1034),
launched a campaign for a state oil monop-
oly!! The entire machinery of the big bank
was set in motion... but there was a snag.
The government (though it had already draft-
ed a bill and put it before the Reichstag)
feared that, without Standard Oil, Germa-
ny would not be able to obtain
oil.
See 1913, p. 736 et seq. 
The war preparations bill (July 3, 1913)
came to the rescueâthe oil bill had to be
postponed. Standard Oil won, for the
monopoly (for the time being) did not even-
tuate.[10]

âThe State and Foreign Loansâ (Alfred Lansburgh).


The German government has forbidden foreign loans? What impels the banks towards that policy? The fact that they are already âboggedâ (Mexico, China, Turkey, etc., threaten to go bankrupt).


What induced the banks to grant loans to such states in the first place? Profit!




...âThere is not a single business of
this type within the country that brings
in profits even approximately equal to
those obtained from the flotation of
foreign loansâ (630)....[12]

Russia to stop interest payments means more

With such loans âit is not clear who is
dancing and who calls the tuneâ, ibidem.

Mexico (p. 628) defaulted more than once (without complete bankruptcy), but is granted loans, for otherwise worse is threatened!!



âRivalry over Foreign Loansâ (1913, No. 10, p. 1024 et seq.  Editorial note).






âA comedy worthy of the pen of Aristophanes is
lately being played on the international capital
market. Numerous foreign countries, from Spain
to the Balkan states, from Russia to Argentina,
Brazil and China, are openly or secretly coming
into the big money markets with demands, some-
times very persistent, for loans. The money mar-
kets are not very bright at the moment and the
political outlook is not promising. But not a sin-
gle money market dares to refuse a loan for fear
that its neighbour may forestall it, consent to
grant a loan and so secure some reciprocal
service. In these international transactions the
creditor always manages to secure some extra
benefit: a favourable clause in a commercial
treaty, a coaling station, a contract to construct
a harbour, a fat concession, or an order for guns...â
(1025).[13]

1913, August, p. 811, note on âSavings Banks and the Banksâ....


...âThe keen rivalry between the savings banks and the banks, which flared up some years ago because each of these so dissimilar organisations is endeavouring to go beyond its own field of activity and penetrate that of the other, continues to occupy the attention of our Chambers of Commerce.â The Bochum Chamber of Commerce demands, for example, that measures be taken against the savings banks, including that they be prohibited from discounting bills, dealing with current accounts, etc. (but allowing them âsafesâ, cheques and endorsement).[14]



Same subject: âBanking Activity of Savings Banksâ (p. 1022 et seq.)






The savings banks are being turned into
institutions for the rich: in Prussia in
1909, out of 10,300 million marks of depos-
its, 4,780 million 46 1⁄3 per cent con-
sisted of deposits > 3,000 marks (15 per
cent of deposits >10,000 marks). Wealthy
depositors often have more than one book.
Savings banks engage in risky operations
(bills, mortgages, etc.) under the spur of
competition (4 or 4 1⁄4 per cent has to be
paid!!). There is a proposal to âbanâ this....

Eschwege) (1913, p. 952 et seq.) on the swindles of speculators in real estate (plots sold at exorbitant prices, builders going bankrupt, workers not paid and ruined, etc. etc.). Attempts by Haberland, head of the gang, to monopolise the âinformation bureausâ, i.e., monopolise all building work. The concluding words are typical:




âUnfortunately, the inevitable course of mod-
ern civilisation apparently leads to the econom-
ic productive forces falling more and more
into the hands of powerful individuals who use
them in a monopolistic way. The economic liber-
ty guaranteed by the German Constitution has
become, in many departments of economic life,
a meaningless phrase. Under such circumstances,
an incorruptible bureaucracy, conscious of its
responsibility, is the granite rock that can
save the public good from the encroaching
flood of avarice. If this rock should crumble,
even the widest political liberty cannot save
us from being converted into a nation of unfree
people,[15] in which case even the monarchy would
have merely a decorative significanceâ (p. 962).

In the Notebooks the world total of securities, 815,000 million francs, is given for 1911, and in Imperialism, for 1910. Lenin took the figure from Zimmermannâs âInternational Statistics of Securities and Stock Issuesâ, which cites as its source a survey by Alfred Neymarck, who gives the figure as referring to January 1, 1911. p. 95

  SCHILDER, FIRST VOLUME
    OF DEVELOPMENT TRENDS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY


Dr. Sigmund Schilder, Development Trends in the World Economy, Vol. I, Berlin, 1912.  (Vol. I: Planned?! Influences on the World Economy.)
























The title is too sweeping, the subtitle plainly fraudu-
lent, for the author has specialised in tariff policy =
there you have his planned influence!!






































The author is secretary of a trade museum.














p. 4âDisagrees with Sombart (with his theory of declining âexport quotaâ). Says this âquotaâ is increasing.


p. 6. An apparent weakening of protectionism (âsigns of thisâ), 1910-11.


p. 6ââUnrest caused by high pricesâ in France in August and September 1911. Dates (N.B.): Vienna, September 17, 1911.


27-28. Agriculture too, is developing (not only industry), âevenâ (âsogarâ) (p. 28, line 8 from below): âin European industrial countriesâ. (This âevenâ is a gem!)


N.B.: approach to the problem of equilibriumâis âworld agricultural purchasing powerâ sufficient? p. 27.)


28-29. The development of agricultural associations (even India has 3,498 with 231,000 members, according to The Times, July 27, 1911).


Especially rapid development of agriculture in the United States.


In the 20th century one can expect the same in Rhodesia,


30: Canada, Sudan (Egyptian), Mesopotamia.


31âGovernments develop agriculture in the colonies âto obtain buyers of industrial goodsâ. (In India (until recently), and in Egypt, with this aim in view, Britain has artificially âhamperedâ the development of industry.)


35-36âFear of a shortage of agricultural products is unfounded. Tropics and subtropics N.B.  Philippines. Only 3-5 million acres are cultivated out of 74 million. (Population is 27 per square kilometre.)




38: âThough it may sound paradoxical
to some, the growth of the urban and indus-
trial population in the more or less near
future is more likely to be hindered by
a shortage of industrial raw materials
than by a shortage of food.â 










N.B.




A shortage of timber: it becomes steadily dearer; idem leather; idem textile raw materials (39).




âAssociations of manufacturers are mak-
ing efforts to create an equilibrium between
agriculture and industry in the whole
of world economy; as an example of this
we might mention the International Feder-
ation of Cotton Spinnersâ Associations
in several of the most important industrial
countries, founded in 1904, and the Euro-
pean Federation of Flax Spinnersâ Asso-
ciations, founded on this model in
1910â (42).[1]

(43-44) âThanks alone to the agricultural

N.B.






72. Extreme protectionism resembles free trade
in that, by making sales within the country more
difficult (high prices), it stimulates foreign trade
(imports (a) of cheap raw materials, etc.) (selling (b)
abroad, for its own population grows poorer). 




87âIt is not true that âtrade agreementsâ have prayed âbankruptâ.










writing on questions of tariff policy, the author adduces
a host of unnecessary and boring details; I omit them.










98âExamples of trade agreements: an agrarian country needs cheap machinery (and its customers need cheap grain): the Bulgarian tariff of March 6-19, 1911âAustriaâs agreement with Germany (1905) (chemicals; artificial indigo, etc.).

Tariff wars are becoming rarer, giving way to
threats, negotiations, etc.




145. British free trade has been based both on her military might (the navy) and colonies.


True, an attitude of indifference to maintaining and increasing colonial possessions prevailed in Britain up to 1860s (in 1864, she even gave Greece the Ionian Islands gratis, without political or economic compensation).


146-48: Intensified acquisition of colonies by Britain began in the eighties. ((Cf. Hobson.)) About 1/3 of Britainâs total exports goes to her colonies; no small amount and N.B.: this export is âespecially profitableâ

Britainâs virtual protectorate over Portugal, and partly over Spain (1901-10) ... Norway (from 1905) ... Siam (the 1860s up to 1904; in 1904 a treaty with France; their joint protectorate)....


âMore interesting and perhaps even more significant than the examples so far mentioned [Egypt, Zanzibar...], where subtropical or tropical semi-civilised countries, after relatively short transitional stages of some few decades, have become or appear to be becoming real British colonies, are a number of other cases. These are cases where for a long time, decades or even centuries, a country with a European civilisation may virtually be a British protectorate, without, at least formally, being deprived of any external mark of full sovereignty.


âPortugal is the best known and outstanding example. Since the war of the Spanish Succession (1700-14) Great Britain has almost continuously used her navy, and on occasion her army, to defend Portugalâs European or over seas possessions from attacks or claims by Spain, France, etc. Conflicts between Britain, the protector, and Portugal, the protected, were accidental and, to a certain extent, family quarrels ... as, for example, the British ultimatum of January 11, 1890, against Portugalâs attempts to land-link her western and eastern colonies in Africa.


âAt any rate, only British support enables Portugal to maintain her possessionsâwhich, though not large, are nevertheless important for such a small countryâon the west coast of India, in South China (Macao) and on Timor, in face of the intense international political rivalry in southern and eastern Asia. In Portuguese East Africa a kind of customs union with British South Africa has even been added to Britainâs political protectorate over Portugalâ (treaty of December 18, 1901).... âAnd it has so far proved economically highly profitable for Portuguese East Africa. It is also a valuable acquisition, now and for the future, for British South Africa and, therefore, for Great Britain.


âThis virtual protectorate of Great Britain over Portugal during its more than two hundred yearsâ existence has proved extremely useful to British trade and shipping [the 1703 treaty with Portugal]....


âHowever, ever since Great Britain adopted peaceful free trade, she has been able through diplomatic action to influence the Portuguese customs tariff in a way hardly to be achieved by any other country, even by the offer of commercial privileges or the threat of a tariff war. Besides, as the dominating power, Great Britain can make especially wide use of all export and investment opportunities involving Portuguese government concessionsâ (railways in Portuguese Africa, etc.)....


âAnd indirectly, again owing to her protectorate over Portugal, Great Britain maintains not only her position in South Africa and her influence in the Congo, but also her maritime supremacy, the firm pillar of her colonial and world-wide political and economic power. For in war or peace, Portugal puts her ports and islands at the disposal of the British fleet for training purposes and as intermediate shipping stations, allows the use of telegraph cables, etc.â (159-61)....[2]




Bismarck's
saying










169âIn wartime Britain used the Euro-
pean states as âexcellent infantryâ (âaccor-
ing to Bismarckâs description, as the âsilly
strong manâ of world politicsâ).




170âBritain supported Belgiumâs separation from Holland (Holland was âcut in halfâ as a rival) so as not to permit a powerful state near London.

175-76. The struggle (of Britain it) against Russia over Persia (long-continued) until the agreement of June 9, 1908.


The struggle (of Britain) against France over Siam (long-continued) until the agreement of April 8, 1904.


178 et seq. âFour periods of British world politicsâ (their designation, p. 184):




1)


First Asiatic period (against Russia), approximately
1870-85.






{


1870âagainst Russiaâs Black Sea rights.




1885âagreement on frontiers of Afghanistan.




2)


African period (against France and in part Portugal
and Germany), approximately 1885-1902 (1898 âFa-
shodaâ).






{


1885âagreement on the Congo: âindependenceâ




(Britain wanted to devour it).




1902âend of the Boer War.




3)


Second Asiatic period (against Russia): approximately
1902-05.






{


Treaty with Japan, 1902. Russo-Japanese War,
1904-1905.




4)


âEuropeanâ period (against Germany), approximately
1903â(âanti-Germanâ)[3]
1903: friction over the Baghdad railway.




194: The British Empire (with its colonies) accounts for: â>one-quarter of international trade turnoverâ (reference to Vol. II, appendix IX)










too small: cf. Lansburgh:  3⁄4[4]










214. Bukharinâs table + Japan? + Portugal (216)â 2.18 million sq. kilometresâ13 million inhabitants.


220. The outlying regions often have a special (tariff) structure (distances too great even for modern facilities).


â Eastern Siberia in Russia


â Philippines in America, etc.


226. Six âspecial economic areasâ in Russia: (1) Poland (Poles speak of âexports to Russiaâ); (2) the South; (3) Archangel; (4) Urals; (5) Moscow; (6) the Baltic (+Finland).




237 ...A trend âemergedâ in 1911 towards a
âGreater Colombiaâ in the northern part of South
America against the United States.

237 and others. The union of the modern gigantic world states into a single economic whole is stated to be an âapproachâ to âuniversal free tradeâ.






âAs far back as the eighteenth century, after the
secession of the North American colonies from Great
Britain, it became apparent to the more far-sighted
colonial peoples that such a brutal colonial policy
[suppression of all industry in the colony] aimed
exclusively at promoting the real or apparent interests
of export of manufactures from the metropolis, could not
be maintained for long. At any rate, that applied
to regions of the temperate zone with active, intel-
ligent populations whose living conditions do not
substantially differ from those of European nations.
In the tropical and subtropical regions, however,
with populations at a lower cultural level, less ener-
getic and militarily and politically weaker, this
old colonial policy was still retained, even though to
a lesser extent. True, nowadays, in both the tropics
and subtropics, outright suppression of incipient
industrial activity is as a rule avoided. But in most
cases colonial governments devote more attention to
developing agricultural and mining raw-material out-
put than to industrial and political problems. And that
for the most part they can do this without much damage
to the economic development of the tropical or sub-
tropical areas concerned is all the more important, since
this enables them to operate this type of colonial
policy for a long time. For the present acute political
rivalry throughout the world, and the emergence of
overseas Great Powers (U.S.A., Japan), afford
the population of the tropics and subtropicsâresentful
at the forcible, ruinous retarding of its economic
developmentâmany means of creating difficulties for
its oppressors and of giving them a distaste for brutal
methods of ruleâ (240-41).

For example, Britain is more and more converting
Egypt into a country producing only cotton (in
1904, of 2,300,000 hectares of cultivated land, 600,000
were under cotton) and hampering industrial develop-
ment (for instance, two cotton textile mills founded
in Egypt in 1901 were made to pay the cotton tax,
that is, the government imposed a âconsumersâ taxâ
on cotton!!!) (244-45). 




N.B.























âPresent-day colonial policyâ.













In general, âmodernâ colonial policy is supposed
to encourage production of raw materials and react
to the development of industry âwith indifference,
if not with hostilityâ (247).












N.B.






âHowever, it is probably no longer possible to
apply that type of colonial policy to the physically
and intellectually more vigorous peoples of temperate
climates; it can be applied only to the weaker peoples
of the tropics and, in part, the subtropics. But even
here it can be carried out only by the more powerful
European metropolitan countries, Great Britain, France
and Germany. The Netherlands, Spain and Portu-
gal, on the other hand, have lost some of their colo-
nial possessions and are able to retain others only
because of the good will and mutual rivalry of the
big colonial powers. Belgium is a notable example.






N.B.








â...But even the strongest colonial power, Great
Britain, in its biggest and most important colony,
India, is compelled to depart considerably from
strict observance of the aboveâmentioned principle
in its trade and industrial policy, so as not to make
her position more difficult than it actually is in the
face of popular, hostile agitationâ (247-48)....

247, note.




âAfter many years of stubborn bloody strug-
gles against the natives in revolt, the U.S.A.,
in the end, conceded the Philippines parlia-
mentary representation (a Congress) with
wide powers. This testifies to the acumen of North
American statesmen in colonial policy. Less
flattering evidence of this acumen, however,
is the land policy of the North Americans
in the Philippines, which is leading to the
formation of latifundia.â

Methods of colonial exploitation: appointment of officials from the ruling nation;âseizure of land by ruling-nation magnates; high taxes (âtraining in labourâ).




âFor colonial peoples in subtropical areas ...
such as the Indians of North India and
the Egyptians, the educated strata of which
have already assimilated European-American
civilisation, the very fact of foreign rule
is an insult that is borne with difficulty
and thought of with extreme hatredâ (249).

In Egypt, the population is much more
homogeneous (in language, nationality, etc.)
than in India, âand the country (Egypt) is
more European than, for instance, some areas
of European Russiaâ (252). 












(similarly, the âsemi-civilisedâ population in Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, Algeria, Tunisia, etc.) (258).

Holland, like Great Britain..., in her colo-
nies follows a âfree-trade policy which, at the
same time, is mainly aimed at developing
the output of agricultural and mining raw
materialsâ (259).
















Germany waged a tariff war against Canada (from July 31, 1898 to March 1, 1910) because of the latterâs preferential tariffs in favour of Britain. It ended with the retention of these tariffs and a customs treaty with Germany.


Most British, Dutch and German colonies, âas far as can be foreseenâ, will remain under the open-door regime in relation to a all countries (271). Trescher (Preferential Tariffs, 1908) contested this, and Schilder says that he has toned down his conclusions.


As regards state contracts (269-70), the custom every where is: preference for âoneâs ownâ country.


ââOpen-doorâ areasâ (old type: Turkey (until 1908), Rumania, Bulgaria, Egypt, Morocco, Persia; new type: Congo, Afghanistan) âare almost always independent or, at least, formally independent states, and in most cases semi-civilised countriesâ... (274).


(1) They usually lack sovereignty. They usually pass into the hands of the Great Powers: separate parts of these areas split off.




N.B.






(2) âIndividual areas of the âopen-doorâ country
split themselves off from the state that previously
ruled them and, after a more or less prolonged tran-
sitional period, acquire full political and economic
sovereignty, the small and medium-sized Balkan
states being in that category. On the whole, this
phenomenon is not so frequent as that indicated
under point 1â (274).




(3) Full independence (Japan) is extremely rare.


Ad. 2. Growth of independence:


Japan in the 1890s.


Bulgaria in 1897-1909 (fully sovereign!).


Siam just now.




Heading of Â§ VI: âThe swallowing-up of âopen-doorâ
areas by the Great Powers: the world econom-
ic usefulness of this historical process is seen
from the examples of Bosnia, Algeria, ...Formosa,
the Belgian Congo, etc....â

Siam, especially since the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, has been developing towards independence (p. 318 et seq.).


Growth of the national movement in ChinaâPersiaâArabiaâEgypt (p. 329), etc., etc.


Â§ IX: âThe disappearance of âopen-doorâ areas is an irreversible but beneficial process for the world economy (337)... These areas are âsemi-barbarianâ, mostly semi civilised.... âApple of discord of the Great Powersâ (337-38)....

Customary condition: expenditure of part of the loan on products of the creditor country (âunusually frequentâ, 342).


Examples: Paris refused Bulgaria a loan in December 1909, and Hungary in September 1910.




...âthese conditions prevent extreme aggrava-
tion of competition on the world market. Inter-
national rivalry is replaced by a more restricted
form of competition, involving only the relevant
industrial enterprises of the creditor state,
in some casesâandâthis borders on cor-
ruption[5]âonly certain enterprises which I
for one or another reason are especially favour-
ably placed ... for example, Krupp in Germany,
Schneider & Co. in Creusot in France, etc.â
(346).... âAlthough it might be thought that
such a monopoly could not be abusedâ...
I for one could apply to another country, in
reality the choice is not easy... (346).

During the last two decades, France has especially often had recourse to this method.


348, note, âaccumulated capitalâ... annually
 in France > 3,000-4,000 million francs
 in Germany 5,000 million francs 


(DelbrÃ¼ckin the Reichstag, February 12, 1911).










The âtariff warâ between Austria and Serbia (from
July 7, 1906 to January 24, 1911 with a seven monthsâ
interval in 1908-09) was partly caused by competition
between Austria and France (both backward countries)
for supplying war materials to Serbia: Paul Deschanel
told the Chamber of Deputies in January 1912 that
from 1908 to 1911 French firms had supplied war
materials to Serbia to the value of 45,000,000 francs
(350).[6]




N.B.












Another method: granting a loan (or with a loan in view) to bargain for âadvantagesâ in a trade treaty:
For example, Britain (my expressions ârobbedâ, âsqueezedâ, etc.)



  Austria in this way by the trade treaty of 
 Dec. 16, 1865 


FranceâRussiaâ  â   â  â

 (until 1917) 


 â  âJapanâ  â   â  â 
 August 19, 1911 



Sometimes countries which borrow capital lend it to other countries, âtrading in capitalâ: e.g., the United States borrows from Britain and lends to South America, etc., etc. (p. 365 et seq.).


Switzerland readily lends to other countries (higher rate of interest), sets up factories in protectionist countries, and so on (p. 367).






...âThe 1909 annual report of the Austro-Hungarian
consulate in Sao Paulo (Brazil) states: âThe Brazilian
railways are being built chiefly by French, Belgian,

The author gives the table only on pp. 381-82 (without + and â), the remaining figures (capital investment) from The Statist are only in the text, moreover (curiously!), while giving annual data on imports for 1870-1911, he does not compute them in seven-year periods!


The authorâs conclusion is that, though the capital investment statistics are not fully accurate (none of private capital investments), they adequately show the correlation (between the decline in the excess of imports and the growth of capital investment) (p. 392).

[11] The petty-bourgeois American economist Henry George (1839-1897) maintained that the chief and universal cause for the division of the population into rich and poor was expropriation of the land from the people. Poverty was thus due to the land monopoly, and it could be eliminated, he declared, by the bourgeois state nationalising the land, leasing it to individuals and using the rent for social needs. In reality bourgeois land nationalisation does not undermine the foundations of capitalism, but assists its development, and does not save the working people from poverty and ruin. Of the âdeclamations of Henry Georgeâ and similar petty-bourgeois doctrines, Karl Marx wrote: âThe whole thing is thus simply a socialistically decked-out attempt to save capitalist rule and actually re-establish it on an even wider basis than its present one.â  (See Marxâs letter to Sorge, June 20, 1881, and Engelsâs preface to the American edition of his Condition of the Working Class in England.) p. 98

   HILDEBRAND, THE SHATTERING, ETC.
   

Gerhard Hildebrand, The Shattering of Industrial Domination and Industrial Socialism, 1910 (Jena).


A summary (mostly a random selection) of figures on the âincreased industrial independence of peasant countriesâ (p. 88)ââthe industrial self-development of hitherto peasant countriesâ (138)....


Â§11. âThe Chinese dangerâ.... By 1920-25 the Chinese will have gone such a long way, etc., etc.


...âThe industrial monopoly of the West-European sphere of civilisation is doomedâ... (203).




p. 207. The question amounts to this: will the
proletariat in the industrial countries be able âto
replace or retain the vanishing peasant basis of food
and clothingâ?
âThe answer to the clear-cut question must be
a downright, clear, remorseless No!â (207).  








209: It is impossible to obtain (in Europe) 200 million sheep
             15-20 million bales of cotton, etc.


âThere is no point in it (the proletariat) wanting to expropriate the capitalists, for the industrial means of production are no longer utilisableâ (210), and it will not be able to go over to agriculture (211)....




 âThe possibility is thus excluded of a democratic




socialism in the sense of a uniform, tightly-knit
regulation of production as a whole by the mass of the
people who possess nothing and rule everything.... 
Much more probable than the domination of peasant
production by an industrial democracy is the domi-
nation of industrial production by a peasant democ-
racyâ (213).






!










!




âHowever, the realisation of democratic socialism through an industrial democracy is absolutely ruled out if we accept:




â1. that peasant economy holds sway in the most
important spheres of organic production;
â2. that the peasant masses hold fast to the private
basis of production;
â3. that the peasant countries naturally endeavour
to draw into their sphere the greatest possible share
of industrial production;
â4. that, under the prevailing conditions of inter-
national competition, especially with the Chinese
quarter of mankind drawn into the nexus of world
economy, and with the conversion of other hitherto
agrarian countries into industrial states, they can
quite freely dispose of their industrial incomes which
have already been monopolised not by them (215);





?









?




â5. that, on the other hand, the industrial states are to a growing extent dependent on foreign peasant bases for their supplies of food and clothing raw materialsâ (216)....






...âThe unfortunate thing is that the industriali-
sation of the East, following the penetration of
Western technical culture, can proceed much faster
than the agrarianisation of the West, with its
industrial over-tension and, it can be safely said,
its industrial degenerationâ (219)....




!?!












âAgrarian educational coloniesâ (224)ââa peasant internal colonisationâ (225)âthose are the âmeansâ proposed by the author.




!!!






Conclusion (i.e., last chapter): âUnited
States of Western Europeâ (229)....[1]




The African peoples require âguidance and careâ âfor an indefinite time to comeâ (232)....  In 20-30 years it will be difficult even for Russia + Great Britain + France âto oppose a Chinese-Japanese coalitionâ (231)....




!!






there is the possibility of a âgreat Islamic move-
mentâ in Africa, which will be âsimultaneously
both revolutionary and reactionaryâ (233).
âTo preventâ (p. 233 in fine) such a movement
âis in the âvital interestâ of Western Europe. 
234ââConsequentlyâ âjoint action in Africa by
all the West-European statesâ is essential.
234âIt is hopeless to expect Russia
(+Japan, China and the United States) to join
in agreements (on disarmament and so forth)â
the West-European nations must unite.
235: We must âslow upâ (verlangsamen) âthe
tempo of capital formation in Western Europeâ...
âmoderateâ the âindustrial tempoâ... âstrengthen
the peasant basisâ ... a customs union ... pro-
gressive taxation, etc....
236ââan import duty on grain is needed, but
a âmoderateâ one.
238âa democratic union of workers (down with
âCommunist utopiasâ) and peasants (238).








!!!!












sic!!










sic!!!
N.B.








!




























239ââas a matter of courseâ, a âUnited States of
Western Europeâ will need a strong army and navy.














240âBritain will prefer to join rather than
remain in âimperialist isolationâ....

!








Economic conditions and forms of trusts dealt with at length.


p. 48: âThe chief rival of the Steel Trust, the Jones and Laughlin Co. of Pittsburgh, is said to have more modern equipment in its mills than the Trust.âLeather trust shareholders blamed the board for the business doing badly, because it had neglected the technical equipment of the factories. The harvester-machine trust was praised for sparing no expense to equip its factories with the most up-to-date machinery in order to reduce production costs and thereby raise competitive power. [Quoted from Kartellrundschau, 1910, pp. 53 and 902.]






âThe tobacco trust has gone the farthest, perhaps,
in this direction. An official report says: âThe trustâs
superiority over competitors is due to the magnitude
of its enterprises and their excellent technical equip-
ment. Since its inception, the tobacco trust has devot-
ed all its efforts to the universal substitution of
mechanical for manual labour. With this end in
view it has bought up all patents that have anything
to do with the manufacture of tobacco and has spent
enormous sums for this purpose. Many of these patents
at first proved to be of no use, and had to be modified
by the engineers employed by the trust. At the end
of 1906, two subsidiary companies were formed solely
to acquire patents. With the same object in view, the
trust has built its own foundries, machine shops and
repair shops. One of these establishments, that in
Brooklyn, employs on the average 300 workers; here
experiments are carried out on inventions concerning
the manufacture of cigarettes, cheroots, snuff, tinfoil
for packing, boxes, etc. Here, also, inventions are
perfected.ââ[1] (Report of the Commissioner of Corpo-
rations on the Tobacco Industry, Washington, 1909,
p. 266.) 
































N.B.














âIt is quite obvious that such a policy greatly stimulates technical progress. Other trusts also employ what are called development engineers whose business it is to devise new methods of production and to test technical improvements. The Steel Trust grants big bonuses to its workers and engineers for all inventions that raise technical efficiency, or reduce cost of production.â[2]


Besides competition, the bad financial circumstances of the majority of trusts (owing to over-capitalisation (N.B.))  are a stimulus to technical progress.






The capital of the Steel Trust = about $1,000
million (âone-seventh of the total national prop-
ertyâ). The shareholders received three new shares
for each old one. (Cf. also Glier in Conradâs
JahrbÃ¼cher, 1908, p. 594.)
 Interest has to be âearnedâ on this triple capital!!!
The capital of the railways = $13,800 million.
Of this, about 8,000 million is fictitious
capital!! (p. 52).




N.B.

In the U.S.A., only the post office is run by the government. Everything else (including railways, telegraphs, etc.) belongs to private companies.


1880â177 telegraph and parcel-post companies with a capital of 66.5 million dollars;




1907â25 companies with a capital of 155 million dollars




of which 6 â 97.7 per cent of the total receipts.
Price is uniform and for telegrams âexcessively
highâ compared with Europe (p. 60).

Railways in disorder: Michelsen (a leading authority!) calls them âanarchic, uneconomic, cumbersome, unscientific, unworthy of the genius of the American peopleâ (p. 63).

(âBETAâ)



   NOTE ON K. KAUTSKY VERSUS IMPERIALISM
   

  N.B.   Kautsky on Imperialism


Hobsonâs book on imperialism is useful in general, and especially useful because it helps to reveal the basic falsity of Kautskyism on this subject.


Imperialism continually gives rise to capitalism anew (from the barter economy of the colonies and backward countries), giving rise anew to transitions from small-scale to large-scale capitalism, from weakly developed to highly developed commodity exchange, etc., etc.


The Kautskyites (K. Kautsky, Spectator and Co.) quote these facts about âhealthyâ, âpeacefulâ capitalism, based on âpeaceful relationsâ, and counterpose them to financial robbery, banking monopolies, deals by the banks with the state, colonial oppression, etc.; they counterpose them as the normal to the abnormal, the desirable to the undesirable, the progressive to the reactionary, the fundamental to the accidental, etc.


This is the new Proudhonism.[2] The old Proudhonism on a new basis and in a new form.


Petty-bourgeois reformism: in favour of a cleanish, sleek, moderate and genteel capitalism.

[2] Proudhonismâan unscientific, anti-Marxist variety of petty-bourgeois socialism deriving its name from the French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon criticised big capitalist ownership from a petty-bourgeois standpoint and dreamed of perpetuating small private ownership. He proposed the formation of a âpeopleâsâ bank and an âexchange bankâ, through which the workers could acquire their own means of production and ensure the sale of their product at a âfairâ price. Proudhon did not understand the role and significance of the proletariat, rejected the class struggle, the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. An anarchist, he denied the necessity for the state. The Proudhonists idealised small-scale commodity production and exchange. âNot abolishing capitalism and its basisâcommodity productionâbut purging that basis of abuses, of excrescences, and so forth; not abolishing exchange and exchange value, but, on the contrary, making it âconstitutionalâ, universal, absolute, âfairâ, and free of fluctuations, crises and abusesâsuch was Proudhonâs ideaâ (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 34).


The new Proudhonism is how Lenin described the reformist theories of the Kautskyites, who depicted the dominance of the monopolies and banks, the omnipotence of the financial oligarchy, colonial plunder, annexations and other intrinsic features of imperialism as accidental excrescences on capitalism, and concocted all manner of plans for âreconstructingâ capitalism, removing monopoly âabusesâ, etc. Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of such theories, whose proponents âwant to go âbackâ to small capitalism (and not towards socialism)â (see p. 93 of this volume). p. 116

     E. AGAHD, BIG BANKS AND THE WORLD MARKET


E. Agahd—St. Petersburg.
Big Banks and the World Market.  

“The economic and political significance of the big banks in the world
market from the standpoint of their influence on Russia’s national economy
and German-Russian relations.” Berlin, 1914. Preface dated: May 1914.



[[BOX:

Reviewed by   Spectator (author is often na\"ive and
“exaggerates the importance of the big banks”, etc.)  in Die Neue
Zeit, 1915, 1 (33rd publication year), p. 61 et seq.

]]



{{

The author spent fifteen years in Russia as inspector of the Russo-Chinese
Bank. There is much of the off end ed vanity of the unrecognised financial
expert, much chatter (a host of phrases against “dilettantes” and
“amateurs”, etc.).

}}



[DITTO: {{ ]

One can and should take Agahd’s figures and facts, but not his
arguments in favour of the British banking system (separation of deposit
banks providing short-term commercial and industrial credits from
speculative banks), nor his arguments against protectionism, etc., etc. The
author wants an “honest”, moderate and genteel capitalism, without
monopolies, without speculation, without promotion of bubble companies,
without “links” between the banks and the government, etc., etc.

[DITTO: }} ]





{{

α) Société Générale, etc.

 Β) Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas (popularly called
“Paribas”)

 γ) Banque de l’Union parisienne....  

“The Paris banking trio, with assets of several thousand million
francs, and with Russia as its chief market, controls the following Russian
banks: (1) the Russo-Asiatic

    

Bank, (2) the St. Petersburg Private Bank, (3) the Union Bank, and has
introduced on the Paris stock exchange the shares of some industrial
concerns that are closely connected with these banks”
       (55)....[1]




N.B. ||

Here, too, quantity passes into quality: banking manipulation and narrow
banking specialisation become an effort to assess broad, mass,
national and world-wide mutual relationships and connections
(Zusammenh\"ange)—simply because billions of rubles (in contrast to
thousands) lead to this, depend on this.  



N.B.  ||

“In 1905–06, large sums of Russian capital were transferred to European,
especially Berlin, banks; but great as was the panic effect of the brief
rule of the masses in revolt against private ownership, the latter rapidly
recovered its calm and reaction was back in the saddle with renewed
strength.  

“In 1907–08 we already see Russian capital flowing back, bringing
with it new international capital” (59).

“The above-mentioned figures, it should be noted, illustrate only a

“If one adds the Moscow and provincial banks, and further the
Crédit Lyonnais and private bankers, and undeposited money, the
figure could well be doubled, and it would not be too high to estimate that
about

||
500 million rubles of ‘panic-struck capital’ [Agahd’s

“These figures, of course, do not allow of an absolutely certain
conclusion because current security prices varied considerably and ruble
encashment in Russia could often have been advantageous.  

“Nevertheless, it can be assumed that a considerable part of the cash
sent abroad returned in the form of Russian annuities.

||| N.B.

Even if one puts this at only 500 million rubles, the amount of
‘panic-struck capital’ rises to about a thousand million rubles”
(60).  

| N.B.

...“The danger of a fall in the value of the ruble, and a financial
crisis, which was developing at the close of 1905, were averted when the
Russian syndicate in Paris, with the participation of the British money
market, took up the 5 per cent loan in the spring of 1906.  

“The government treasury thus received almost one thousand
million rubles in cash. In the following quiet years of 1907–08

|

the banks and the state treasury were in a very favourable position, that
is to say, cash was freely available, the force of facts had powerfully
stimulated thinking, and something sensible could be created on a realistic
basis,—if desired.  
 


N.B.  “as well” N.B.  |||

“These two years had a beneficial effect on trade and industry as well,
and led to improvement and reconstruction. Private industry, i.e., industry
not dependent on government orders (oil, sugar, textiles, paper, timber),
remained thoroughly

|

healthy, and it was only the labour question that assumed quite a
different, i.e., a political, character” (61)....  

“The years of change, 1905–08, caused many Russian capitalists to
deposit their liquid money in German banks”... (see above).  

“Things went so far that one of the most conservative (and most
independent) Russian banks

sic!!  ||

bought Prussian Consols as a reserve against unforeseen developments.  

“At that time (1906) the Russian banks were not particularly rich in
cash.—The intense peasant movement had caused much damage in the
villages; the workers

N.B. ||

in the towns, however, had left trade and industry comparatively
unharmed. The fact is well known that, in spite of the numerous strikes,
there were only a few acts of sabotage against private property and
warehouses belonging to trade and industry (the sabotage in Baku should be
attributed to Armenians and Tatars) (apart from the gross disorders on the
railways, which, however, should not be ascribed to the free workers).”

The author, of course, is an arch-bourgeois and nationalist in his
political sympathies!  


“In fact, the number of bills protested at that time rose only
slightly, which caused the more surprise in financial circles of the
continent, the less the contemporary (peasant) movement was understood”

“Berlin financial circles particularly weakened their relations with
Russian private industry in 1905–06, that is, precisely when there was a
large flow of cash from all parts of Russia. Until then the Lodz weaving
and spinning mills (mostly German-owned) had depended mainly on the Berlin
financial market and had always been good clients; nevertheless the Berlin
banks deprived these firms of considerable credits, forcing many of them
not only substantially to reduce production, but even send a consortium of
very wealthy Lodz textile industrialists to the Caucasus to take part in
mining enterprises

|| !!

there and seek contacts with the London and even the New York
market. Contacts were not established chiefly due to the pogroms which took
place at that time” (67)....  

...“It should be borne in mind, that Russia’s losses in the Japanese
war, including Port Arthur, Dalny and the southern part of the
Chinese-Eastern rail way, amounted to approximately 4,500 million rubles,

|| N.B.

i.e., half of the national debt, on which, consequently, the Russian
peasants have to pay interest and amortisation, without receiving any of
the capital” (72).  

From Chapter V: “Participation of the German big banks in the
St. Petersburg banks, etc.”

|| N.B.



How does the Deutsche Bank place shares of the Siberian Commercial Bank
in Berlin?  

...“The Deutsche Bank keeps new foreign shares

    

N.B.  !!!  ||

in its portfolio for a year and then sells them on the Berlin Stock
Exchange with a 50 per cent middleman’s profit. The public pays at the rate
of 193 for 100”...
 (74)[2]


“so that a ‘German’ big bank comfortably and rapidly makes a profit
(on the market price)”...  (74).  

...“Since, however, the Deutsche Bank has placed the shares among the
Berlin public at 195 per cent,

N.B. |

and subsequently still dearer (at present the market price is 230 with a 15
per cent dividend—the rate of interest is therefore 6 1/2 per cent), the
primary concern of the bank’s board in St. Petersburg must be to ensure
that dividends remain at the same level.  This is a categorical demand
of the foreign bank.  It is the only demand it makes.—How
it is done is a matter of complete indifference to it, and the result is
wild speculation on the Stock Exchange and speculative share-promoting into
which the St. Petersburg banks are directly forced by the ‘holdings
system’” (77).  

“Statistically, from the German standpoint, the operation appears as
follows: 

“Increase of capital since 1906–07:

 16,000,000 rubles—nominal share capital at the average market
price of about 200 (when put on the Berlin Stock Exchange)

 10,000,000—from issues on reserve account

 26,000,000—in all

 32,000,000—actual capital at 200

 6,000,000 rubles—difference—middleman’s profit in favour of the
Deutsche Bank and its clients”
      (78)....[3]
 6 million rubles |||



! ||

...“The Deutsche Bank thus offered the German public about 32,000,000
rubles of shares with the sole aim that it, the Deutsche Bank, should
pocket the Judas reward of several millions in market price difference”
(78).  
 

At a general meeting of Siberian Commercial Bank shareholders on
March 23, 1913, a small group of shareholders headed by a barrister,
Bibikov, protested against the decisions of this general
meeting. (Birzheviye Vedomosti No. 14017, February 21, 1914;
S. Peterburgskaya Gazeta No. 51, February 22, 1914;
S. Peterburgskaya Gazeta No. 54, February 23, 1914.)  The
protesters proved ... “that the bank’s director-general

|| !!

(a certain
Soloveichik, connected by family ties with one of the Deutsche Bank
directors) had put to his own private account seven million rubles of
government subsidies and had used the money to buy shares of his own bank
and thus acquire the majority of votes needed for his re-election”
(79)... “If it is borne in mind that German capital operates here, and
that such business methods are encouraged by the famous Deutsche Bank,
increased importance attaches to the conclusion which I am endeavouring to
prove in this book, viz., that the ‘holdings system’ prevents even a
serious Russian side from ensuring a sound and orderly management of the
credit institutions that are so important to Russia. The Deutsche Bank is,
of course,

|| !!

in a position to procure for itself a majority of votes, but the
Russian shareholders, who also participate in the bank, will never be able
to secure a majority sufficient to put into practice their just wishes and
reasonable views” (80).  

...“Since 1906 there has been still further and greater German
participation in the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, known as the
Russian Bank, and the St. Petersburg International Commercial
Bank, known as the International;

|||

the former belongs to the Deutsche Bank concern, the latter to the
Discontogesellschaft in Berlin.

| | | N.B.

Both these Russian banks employ three—fourths German money (share
      capital).[4]

The Russian Bank and the International are the two most important Russian
banks. Both are strongly speculative”... (82).

(136 and others.) Russian Ministers of Finance appoint bank
directors (often from government officials), give the banks millions in
subsidies through the “Credit Office”, etc.  


well put!  ||

“This gives the key to the activity of those St. Petersburg
banks—‘Russian’ in their external appearance, ‘foreign’ in the sources of
their funds, ‘dilettante’ in their conduct of business, and ‘ministerial’
in the risks they take—which have grown into parasites of Russian
economic life.—And this precedent [reference is to the Siberian
Bank, etc.] has now become a principle of organisation for the
St. Petersburg banks. The Berlin and Paris directors of the big banks
believe that the following guarantee their interests  

“1) the direct Credit Office subsidies to St. Petersburg banks, 


!!  N.B.  ||

“2) the credit balance of the Russian Finance Ministry (of which about 60
per cent is in Paris and 40 per cent in Berlin)” (137)....  

“The Finance Ministry authorised the Russo-Chinese Bank [in which the
author served!!] to issue a series of state-guaranteed securities to
provide it with the necessary cash resources, without being concerned as to
how these were used. Thus, for example, it handed over to the bank the
issue of state-guaranteed railway

||

shares in European Russia, and the income went directly into the bank’s
coffers. The railways would need the money gradually, in the course of 4–5
years (during their construction), and in the meantime the bank could
freely

N.B.  !!  ||

dispose of the money and, in addition, earn

    

profit from the issue of the shares. This became an established procedure,
for it was repeated several times each year” (149).  

(The shares of four railways total £ 12,800,000 = about 120
million rubles.)  

“The director (who is also the president) of the bank is a board
member of a number

||| 20 companies!!

of big railway and industrial companies (at present about 20), which
likewise have to keep their free cash on current account in the bank,
knowing that the Finance Ministry is greatly interested in the bank and

||| N.B.!!

supports it” (149).  


[[BOX ENDS:

That is how “business” is done....

]]



This in Chapter 11: “The Merger of the Russo-Chinese Bank with the
Northern Bank (Russo-Asiatic Bank) and the Protest against This at the 1910
General Meeting” (p. 147): 

(the protest was moved by the author himself) 

“Most of those present at the general meeting of the Russo-Chinese
Bank, which was intended to

|| N.B. !!

confirm the merger, were State Bank and Credit Office officials holding
proxy votes”... (153).  

The author registered a

“dissenting opinion“, 

entered in the minutes of the meeting of March 30, 1910 (p. 154).  

“The holdings system is nonsense”—the author argued in his
protest... (p. 154).  

A “merger” was carried out by the French banks (Banque de Paris et
des Pays Bas + Société Générale) which were
“interested” in the Russo-Chinese Bank, saw its affairs were in a bad
state, wanted to “extricate” themselves and hoped 

“by the merger [of the two banks into one—the Russo-Asiatic], to
create such a big ‘Russian’

|| N.B. !!

institution that the Russian government would be compelled to ‘uphold’ the
merged bank under all circumstances” (p. 151).  

“When the merger took place, the share capital was reduced by 33
per cent and these sums were put

    

!! ||

to reserve account. This gave the bank the appearance of having created
this reserve capital as a result of good business management, while at the
same time enabling the new administration in the future to distribute the
entire profit () on a diminished capital at a higher rate of interest,
because the reserve capital had, at one stroke,

N.B.  |||

reached the legal maximum and no interest had to be paid on it. The
shareholders were helpless even against this manipulation, for they were in
France, while the general meetings took place in St. Petersburg”... (152).


...“When the Russo-Asiatic Bank states that its

||

share capital is 45 million rubles and reserve capital 23.3 million rubles,
every unprejudiced person will assume that the reserve has been derived
from earned money, i.e., is the result of good business management. In
reality, however, it comes out

!! ||

of share capital, and is the result of bad business management. Neither
bank had reserves prior to the merger” (153)....  

And, in fact, this bank, with 120 branches (), has too
little capital (a balance-sheet of 785

!! |||

million rubles with a capital of 73 1/2 million + reserves—October 1,
1913)—“the risk of this overloading has to be borne by the Credit
Office” (153).  

...“Furthermore, it is quite clear that under the ‘holdings system’,
which prevents the share-owners from passing judgement on the management of
the company, because between them and the

||

company stand the all—powerful big (foreign) banks,

N.B. ||

which can use more or less ‘masked combinations’ to rob both sides,
directors are appointed arbitrarily and according to private interests, so
that,

ha-ha! ||

in the end, any dilettante can become a bank director” (156–57).  

The board of the Russo-Asiatic Bank consists of “a former Russian
bureaucrat (as Director-General

sic!! ||

and President of the bank), a former Russian Governor, a former French
diplomat, and a former French lawyer” (158).  
 

All this criticism is stated to have been written in the autumn of 1913
and to have “become obsolete” owing to the Imperial rescript of
January 30, 1914.

The union of deposit and speculative banks is harmful because it 

(1) “ties up” the country’s productive means 

(2) leads to a rise in prices, syndicates, etc.  

“If clarity and order were established in banking conditions, I 
should indeed

| ha-ha!  that what it comes to!!

like to see whether there could be trusts, monopolies and syndicates”
(179)....  

“Let it be legally laid down that firms concluding agreements which
militate against the consumer by eliminating competition (by dishonest
competition) will not

| ha-ha!!  simple!!

be granted official bank credits and, therefore, will not be allowed to
issue securities, and then monopolies and syndicates might very soon be
dissolved” (180).  

Subsidies of the Credit Office

|| !!

(pp. 202 and 204) to the St. Petersburg banks amount to
800–1,000 million
rubles[7]

.



The Credit Office... “is the keyboard controlling all credit activity
in the Empire”. “It is a bureaucratic apparatus without a statute and
without public control” (200).  

...“In 1910 it was ... reformed and since then its task has been to
‘co-ordinate’ the activities of all the credit institutions of the
      country,[8]

and ‘it is the connecting link between these and the Stock
Exchanges’”....  The St. Petersburg banks report to it
every eight to fourteen days, and in more detail every three months (201).

 

Four “modes” of these
      subsidies[9]

Mr. Davydov (Credit Office), i.e., ...half the free working cash in the

“The clear meaning of these statistics of proportions is that the
one-third minority of capital-exporting countries dominates the two-thirds
majority of Russia as a capital-importing country (p. 213), and, moreover,
in such forms (subsidies, syndicates, cartels, etc.) that this minority can
protect neither its own interests nor those of others. In consequence of
this, last but not

least,[11]

the private interests of a few boards of big banks dominate, not officially
but secretly, and in such a way that all concerned suffer.”  


{{

In this the author sees the cause of the rise of prices, even giving
(p. 213) an approximate percentage rise of prices in 1908–13, but this
cannot be taken seriously, it is not a proof, simply an unnecessary
illustration....

“If we, the big banks, succeed in ruling over producers and
consumers (through stock issues, credit and customs duties), then the
profits will flow into our pockets and we become masters of the
situation” (Agahd’s italics) (218).  


[[TRIPLE BOX ENDS:

||| “even” to war

The consequence of this, he says, may be “excessive raising of customs
duties” and because of that “open hostility in the world market, which
could even lead to war, what may also suit the big bank monopolists,

|| one of the motives for war

because with the force majeure of war they can purge their balance-sheets
without being held personally responsible for the losses” (220)....

Here, says Agahd “the bank question, with which the author (Prokopovich)
is not familiar”, plays the biggest role.  
 

On the question of Russia’s balance of trade, the author
writes that the excess of the credit over the debit side was 



1909—
570 
 mill, rubles (p. 238) 


1910—
511


1911—
 430 





1,371[12]



—


 
 600 
—minus coupon payments abroad of 200 million rubles per annum


 
771
—“total excess in 3 years”.




“Concerning this sum, therefore, it can be said that it has in part
(I  put it at 500 million rubles) more than normally enriched the country
in cash resources thanks to especially good harvests. But this figure
proves, plainly and obviously, that the apparently gigantic upswing in
Russia was by no means due only to favourable harvests.  

“To this must be added the import of capital under guaranteed and
private stock issues of about 1,509 million rubles, of which, however, only
a negligible amount was put on the market in the form of cash (most of it
went into special undertakings).  

||

“The director of the Credit Office (Davydov) gives the following estimate
of the growth of the country’s free working capital (by which he means
private deposits in all the banks, savings-banks deposits (an increase of
576 million in cash and securities), current accounts of government
agencies in the State Bank, excluding, however, current accounts of the
Credit Office with foreign bankers and the debts of Russian banks abroad):

N.B.  ||
 1906—2,592 million rubles

 1912—5,000 million rubles” (p. 238).


 

The growth, he says = about 2,500 million rubles, and import of capital
about 1,600 + 771 (inflow due to good harvests) = 2,371 million rubles
(p. 239)—“they approximately balance”....  

“The Russian Finance Ministry utilises here” (in reference to
Russia’s excessive gold reserve) “its cash just as unscientifically, just
as unsoundly from the economic stand point, just as anti-nationally as most
of the

(247).  

||| N.B.

The national income (the “national budget agricultural production, i.e.,
the grain harvest and all other products”) in Russia (1913) was only
9,000 million rubles (249).

This is how the author criticises Witte’s financial policy: =

shifted the risk on to the Treasury, instead of properly organising
things” (275)....

(276)....

...“However, I  again stress the difference between the speculating

directing banking business along lines that rule out speculation in deposit

“I have already expressed my regret
that Russia is being involved in the ‘money market of the civilised

...“One can say: Under present circumstances

That “my” (Agahd’s) “programme” should be “un-national”??  God
forbid!! I  am not a cosmopolitan, I  am a nationalist (pp. 287
and 288), I  am for the independence of every nation, for good
banking, for successful “deals”.

...“If such a programme is not ‘national’, then please explain to me
what is really

management of lastingly profitable businesses does not come under this
concept?” (288).

“Reform of the continental big-banking business is therefore in general
the first condition for an economic-political agreement in Europe, and this
is wholly in accord with the interests of the nations” (290) 
 

and the last phrases in the book: 

“And my final propositions read as follows:

If the European (continental) Great Powers continue unswervingly their

it. Freedom of the money market and freedom of the world market—through

classes carry the entire responsibility.”

“At the end of 1910, the world total of securities quoted and negotiable in
the various financial markets was 815,000 million. Of this sum, 570,000–600,000
million are owned by nationals of various countries” (p. 223: Neymarck).


...“In fact, one must not confuse—as we always emphasise—the
total value of securities quoted on one or several markets with the total owned
by the capitalists of these countries. A security issue may be quoted and
negotiated in several markets at the same time” (p. 203).

[10]

Kautsky’s theory of ultra-imperialism
(super-imperialism)—an opportunist theory of a new phase of
imperialism—“internationally united finance capital”—that would lead
to an organised world economy, with imperialist contradictions abolished,
by agreement between the capitalist countries. Lenin exposed the real
social meaning and purpose of this “theory”, which whitewashes and seeks
to perpetuate imperialism. He described it as “a most reactionary method
of consoling the masses with hopes of permanent peace being possible under
capitalism, by distracting their attention from the sharp antagonisms and
acute problems of the present times, and directing it towards illusory
prospects of an imaginary ‘ultra-imperialism’ of the future. Deception of
the masses—that is all there is in Kautsky’s ‘Marxist’ theory”

(see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 294).



Kautsky’s theory of “ultra-imperialism” is repeated in different
versions by latter-day apologists of imperialism. It finds expression in
all manner of bourgeois and reformist projects for a world capitalist state
with a single government, and so forth.

(For Lenin’s criticism of Kautsky’s anti-Marxist theory, see present
edition, Vol. 22, pp. 288–98).

“It should be borne in mind that at first a certain resistance is to be
expected, especially from the backward section of the workers, who will
always try by persuasion to prevent piece-workers from reaching the highest
productivity” (28).  

“...the difficult period of transition from the slow pace of ordinary
work to the high speed which is the leading characteristic of good
management” (29)....  

p. 9: “The main aim of systematic go-slow practices is to keep the
shop management ignorant of the potential productivity of machines and
workers.  

“This go-slow technique is so universal that hardly a competent
workman can be found in a large establishment with conventional wage
systems who does not devote a consider able part of his time to studying
just how slowly he can work and still convince his employer that he is
going at a good pace” (9)....  
 


!! ||

“Since 1883, the author has been introducing his method in the most
diverse United States industries, and has never had to face strikes. He
believes that, under his system, strikes are inevitable only if the
majority of the workers belong to a union whose rules are so inflexible
that members are allowed to work only on terms laid down by the union”
(25)....  

Another example (p. 33 et seq.). Girls tested polished steel balls
by hand, rejecting them as spoilage if roughnesses, etc., were
found.  

Observation, control and “time studies” were introduced and the best
workers chosen, etc., etc. “It turned out that the girls spent a
considerable part of their time talking, or actually doing nothing. The
most negligent girls were set apart or, if incorrigible, dismissed”
(35)....

“System of functions” of the foremen 

 I) in the workshop

 1. Organising foremen (of the work itself) 
 2. Foremen to adjust speed of work 
 3. Testing foremen 
 4. General supervisory foremen (order). 


 II. in the office

 1. Route Clerk—sets tasks for each shop 
 2. Instruction Card Clerk—specifies how the job is to be done
  
 3. Time and Cost Clerk 
 4. Shop Disciplinarian (general supervision) 



 


N.B.  ||

It is a mistake to suppose that the factory works the better the fewer the
number of its “non-productive” workers (productive physical labour;
“non-productive = supervisors, etc., foremen, etc.). On the
contrary.  

p. 50 [§ 133 (281–83)]. The best factories have one
“non-productive” to six or seven productive workers. The worst have one
“non-productive” to eleven productive.  


[[BOX ENDS:

p. 63. In the excellent Tabor Manufacturing Co. (with about 100
workers; makers of instruments and moulding-machines), Wallichs found one
office employee to three workers!!!

]]



p. 67. Conditions for “reform” ((time required for it =2–4
years!!)) ... “that a body of workers of exceptionally high productivity
should be enlisted, who will work extra hard and receive extra high
wages”...  

...“that the number of supervisory foremen and officials should be at
least doubled” (67).  


((

Written reports at least in the form of printed index cards for
each worker!! not to speak of foremen!!

))




|||

...“however, quite a long time is still needed before they (the workers)
learn to stay steadily at their work and make every minute count.

N.B.  ||

Many of them, with the best of intentions, will fail in this and find that
they have no place in the new organisation” (69).  


N.B. ||

...“the opportunity of becoming a foreman or senior worker has become far
greater, for under the new conditions an increased number of them are
required” (75).  

(winning over and buying up workers by
turning them into foremen) 


|

Time and motion studies are very difficult. A certain engineer (Sandford
E. Thompson) (p. 81), for instance, spent six years conducting them in the
building trades!!! He took every stop-watch observation himself and worked
up and tabulated his data with the help of two assistants! ((Excavation,
masonry, carpentry, cement work, plastering, and so on and so forth)) 
 


|| !

...“the tables and descriptive matter for one of these trades alone
take up about 250 pages”....


Further, by tenths of a second (p. 84) (special watches)—the
smallest operations were studied (putting down a spade; taking up a wheel
barrow; moving a wheel barrow; placing a wheel barrow; taking up a spade,
etc., etc.), and measurement made (cubic metres) of the size of a wheel
barrow, idem of a spade, etc., etc.  

For measurement, the best (91) workers are to be chosen and
paid a higher pay (promising an increase of pay)....  

Yet another example: overhauling and cleaning of boilers. The author
told his assistant to study this. The latter was a novice and did
nothing. The author personally carried out the work, making a
careful time study. It turned out that a great part of the time was lost
owing to the “constrained position” of the workman (99). “Protective
pads” were made “to fasten to the elbows, knees and hips, and
special tools and appliances were made for the various work operations,”
etc., etc. (100).  

“The whole scheme [many pages: how to perform the work] was much
laughed at when it first went into use”.... The result: cost of
overhauling and cleaning of a set of boilers

|| 250 and 44

of 300 h.p. fell from
250 marks to 44 marks!!!


In the ten years the author worked at the Midvale Steel Works there
were no strikes. The best workers did not join the unions, for they
received the best (highest) pay.  


|

“The firm followed the policy of raising the wages of each employee on a
suitable occasion and promoting all who deserved it. A careful record was
kept of each man’s good points as well as his shortcomings, which was
especially the duty of the foremen, so that justice could be done to
each. When men throughout an establishment are paid according to their
individual worth, it cannot he in the interest of those receiving high pay
to join a union with the cheap men” (101).  

There is a lot of talk about the unity of interests of the working
class and the employers, etc. The author is for fines as the best
disciplinary measure....  Fines for the benefit of the accident insurance
fund ((from five pfennigs to 250 marks—the size of the fines both
against officials and against oneself!!))....

Very influential workers’ unions are against the Taylor system (110)....

      SEUBERT, THE TAYLOR SYSTEM IN PRACTICE


Dipl. Ing. Rudolf Seubert, The
Taylor System in Practice, Berlin, 1914.  

The author spent eight months studying the Tabor Manufacturing
Co. (Philadelphia) and promises a detailed practical description.



[HUGE LEFT MARGIN:]

p. 6: “Those well acquainted with German and American conditions will at
once concede that,

||

as regards economic use of material, German industry is far in advance of
American, but,

    

on the other hand, as regards economic use of

|| characteristic!

human labour-power, Germany has still much to learn from the U.S.A.”
(7)....  

“Time studies” are better called “productivity studies”: not only
is the time observed, but the best work methods are
studied and deduced (9–10)....  


|||| N.B.

—“The science of work” (10)


Movement is studied by the cinematograph—a slanting position
facilitates handling of the material (without looking) etc., etc.

||| N.B.

“No unnecessary or purposeless movements” (15).  

The method must be put into effect cautiously,

||| sic!!!! N.B.

in keeping with American democratic customs (p. 22) so that it
shall not be regarded as “torture” (22).  

The wage increase is usually one-third, whereby the worker receives



||||| N.B.  bour- geoisi- fying!!!

an amount that, “as regards his position, already puts him (if +
one-third) at the economic level of a fairly well-paid tradesman or
technician” (22)....  

p. 30: “On the average” the Taylor reform takes “five
years”.  The Tabor Manufacturing Co. was “in danger of
bankruptcy”

!!

because of the expense of introducing the Taylor system.  

The Tabor Manufacturing Co. was founded in the 1890s.  In 1904 there
was a strike (half-won). Things were going badly.  Taylor offered to
provide money if he were allowed to reorganise (32). Accepted.

 After five years: production increased 80%;

 costs decreased 30%;

 wages increased 25%;



in 1912



{{

45 workers (33)

 48 (!!sic!!!) officials and foremen
((usually 1 : 3)) (clerks) (office workers and foremen).



Next come copies of the “keys” (abbreviations), formulas, papers,
instructions—a mass of written material, highly complex ... office
workers call it the “talmud” (p. 35)....  
 

One employee is engaged solely in studying productivity (time
studies), which enables him to study deeply all hand movements and
operations, and to improve them.  

...“In this way, hardly a day passes in the Tabor Manufacturing
Co. without some aspect of the work

N.B. ||

being tested through productivity studies for its expediency and found
capable of improvement” (107).  


[[BOX:

N.B. |

]]

p. 153: “Time and motion studies” = the most “interesting”
and the most “sensational” feature of the Taylor system.

[[RIGHT BOX END:]]



[Hours—hours and hundredths of an hour (p. 124). More convenient.]


Difficulties in applying the system in Germany: “In Germany, the
social stratification of the working classes is a difficulty that should
not be under-estimated.

!! N.B.  |||

In Germany, an academically educated man prefers to address one not so
educated in a tone of command, and the same thing applies between the
engineer and the foreman, and between the foreman and the worker. Under the
Taylor system, where they must feel themselves co-workers, such a tone will
no longer be permissible” (152).... It will take years to become
accustomed to “workers being promoted to the posts of foremen and
officials”....

      GILBRETH, MOTION STUDY


Frank B. Gilbreth, Motion Study as an Increase of
National Wealth. (Annals of the American Academy, 1915, May,
p. 96 et seq.)  

...“The motions of every individual, no matter what his work may be,
have been studied and standardised....  

...“In laying bricks, the motions used in laying a single brick were
reduced from 18 to 5, with an increase in output from 120 bricks an hour to
350 an hour. In folding cotton cloth, 20 to 30 motions were reduced to 10
or 12, with the result that instead of

? ||

150 dozen pieces of cloth, 400 dozen were folded, with no added
fatigue. The motions of a girl putting paper on boxes of shoe polish were
studied. Her

    

methods were-changed only slightly, and where she had been doing 24 boxes
in 40 seconds, she did 24 in 20 seconds, with less effort. Similar studies
have cut down the motions not only of men and women in other trades but
also of surgeons, of nurses, of office workers; in fact, of workers in
every type of work studied”... (96-97).  

Assembly of braiding machines ... “where eighteen braiders had been
assembled by one man in a day, it now becomes possible to assemble 66
braiders per man per day, with no increase in fatigue” (97)....  

The latest method 1) micro-motion studies ... 2) use of the
“chronocyclograph” (97)....  

I. The “micro-motion clock” is placed in front of the worker and it
registers “different times of day in each picture of a motion picture
film” (98)....  

II. “The chronocyclograph method of making motion study consists of
fastening tiny electric light bulbs to the fingers of the operator, or to
any part of the operator or of the material whose motion path it is desired
to study”... (the movement of the light, its track, is photographed) (98).


These studies are in the interest of society as a whole.... “One
typical result is the gradual filling in of the gap between the school and
the plant. An intensive study of motions is proving that there are far
greater likenesses in trades, and even professions,

||| !! N.B.

on the mechanical side, than we have ever believed possible. The demand of
the industrial world will be more and more for young workers trained to be
fingerwise” (101)....  

This must be taught in the schools.  

...“fingerwise, that is, training his muscles so that they respond
easily and quickly to demands for skilled work”....  

At present an “enormous waste” (102) is occurring from scattered,
duplicated, etc., “investigations”.... “It is the work of the United
States Government to establish such a bureau of standardisation of
mechanical trades. The standards there derived and collected would be
public property, and original investigators could invent from these
standards upwards” (103)....  
 


[[BOX ENDS:

a splendid example of technical progress under capitalism towards
socialism.

Impossible to read after Riesser: repetitions, raw material, minor

 This refers only to the beginning of the book. Apparently, Riesser

p. 103: The brothers Mannesmann sold their patents for “seamless
pipes” for 16 million marks (!) (1890).  

Every crisis (1857, 1873, 1900) leads to concentration, but especially
1900: 

“Side by side with the gigantic plants in the basic industries, the
crisis of 1900 still found many plants organised on lines that today would
be considered obsolete, the ‘pure’ [non-combined] plants, which were
brought into being at the height of the industrial boom.

    

The fall in prices and the falling off in demand put these ‘pure’
enterprises in a precarious positions which did not affect the gigantic
combined enterprises at all or did so only for a very short time.  As a
consequence the crisis of 1900 resulted in a far greater concentration of
industry

|| N.B.

than the crisis of 1873; the latter crisis also produced a sort of
selection of the best-equipped enterprises, but owing to the level of
technical development at that time, this selection could not place the
firms which success fully emerged from the crisis in a position of
monopoly. Such a durable monopoly exists to a high degree in the gigantic
enterprises in the modern iron and steel and electrical industries owing to
their very complicated technique, far-reaching organisation and

|| monopoly

magnitude of capital, and, to a lesser degree, in the engineering industry,
certain branches of the metallurgical industry, transport, etc.”
      (108)....[1]


p. 111: When it was found necessary to make the firm Phoenix
join the Stahlwerksverband, the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein
bought up the majority of its shares and ensured the adoption of
the required decision.  

In the same way, the Dresdner Bank “won” two places on the
Supervisory Board of the K\"onigs- und Laurah\"utte iron and steel mills
(four years ago) and carried through what it wanted....  

The role of the Supervisory Boards is very wide (in fact it could be =
management)....  

||| sic!  (simple!)

...“Seats on Supervisory Boards are freely offered to persons of
title, also to ex-civil
servants, who are able to do a great deal to facilitate relations with the
=

  authorities”...[2]

(149).  


||| the usual story!!

“Usually, on the Supervisory Board of a big bank,
there is ... a member of parliament or of the Berlin City Council”
     (152)....[3]

 

155 (in fine)... “But the cases quoted [a number of
“names” are cited: Dernburg—director of the Darmst\"adter
Bank, Gwinner—director of the Deutsche Bank] clearly show that Industrial
leaders are mainly on the Supervisory Board of companies of the same branch
or the same region, whereas directors of the big banks, on the other hand,
are on the boards of the most diverse enterprises”....  

1. The director of the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein is on the
Supervisory Boards of 33 companies!! (p. 155).  

p. 150: an example of 35 seats on Supervisory Boards being
in the same hands... (35).  

p. 156... “Simultaneously with this widening of the sphere of activity
of certain big industrialists and with the assignment of provincial bank
managers to definite

||

industrial regions, there is a growth of specialisation among the directors
of the big banks. Generally speaking, this specialisation is only
conceivable when banking is conducted on a large scale, and particularly
when it has widespread connections with industry. This division of labour
proceeds along two lines: on the one hand, relations with industry as a
whole are entrusted to one director, as his special function; on the other,
each director

|| “supervision” of social economy

assumes the supervision of separate enterprises, or of a group of
enterprises in the same branch of industry or having similar interests. One
specialises in German industry, sometimes even in West German industry
alone, others specialise in relations

|||

with foreign states and foreign industry, in information on the characters
of industrialists, and others, in Stock Exchange questions, etc. Besides,
each bank director often assigned a special locality or a special branch of
industry; one works chiefly on Supervisory Boards of electric

N.B. |||

companies; another, on chemical, brewing, or beet sugar plants, a third, in
a few isolated

    

industrial enterprises, but at the same time works on the Supervisory
Boards of non-industrial companies, such as insurance companies. To
demonstrate this from the example of some Berlin bank directors would take
us too far into the personal sphere. In short, there can be no doubt that
the growth in the dimensions and diversity of the big banks’ operations is
accompanied by an ever greater division of labour among their directors
with the object (and result) of, so to speak, lifting them somewhat out of
pure banking and making them better experts, better judges

||| N.B.

of the general problems of industry and the special problems of each branch
of industry, thus making them more capable

|| “system”

of acting within the respective bank’s industrial sphere of influence. This
system is supplemented by the banks’ endeavours to elect to their
Supervisory Boards or those of subordinate banks, men who are experts in
industrial affairs,

||

such as industrialists, former officials, especially
those with experience in the railway service or in
       mining,[4]

from whom they want not so much connections with industrial enterprises as
expert advice—advice, based less on academic education than on many years
of technical, business and human experience”...  (157).  

...“But as member of a Supervisory Board, a bank director has not only
the advantage of being interested in conscientious performance of his
office because of his responsibility to the bank; he also is the best
informed as to the state of the

|| N.B.

market and can make his large office staff carry out the commercial and
technical

    

view of the “whole” |||

assignments of the Supervisory Board. It is his knowledge of many companies
that facilitates his judgement of a particular one and guards him against
the over estimation that is often observed when a private person sits on
the board of only one company” (157–58).  

At the end of 1903, representation of the German big banks on the
SUPERVISORY BOARDS of industrial companies was as follows

“universal nature” |||

...“The universal nature of banking operations in industry, as so far
described, the possibility and necessity for a big bank systematically to
use regular business

    

transactions, the granting of industrial credit, the issue of securities,
and representation on Supervisory Boards, as a means of close and lasting
relations with industrial enterprises—all this

||| “a tight net”

weaves such a tight net around the bank and the industrial enterprise that
a competitive struggle with the latter over a particular business operation
is often, and in the case of many companies permanently, excluded”
(163)....  

“An examination of the sum total of industrial relationships reveals
the

||| “universal character”

universal character of the financial establishments working on behalf of
industry.

|| “unlike” (the old)

Unlike other kinds of banks, and contrary to the demand sometimes expressed
in

||

the literature that banks should specialise in one kind of business or
in one branch of industry in order to prevent the ground from slipping from
under their feet—the big banks are striving to make their connections
with industrial enterprises as varied

|||

as possible in respect of the or branches of industry and are to eliminate
the unevenness in the distribution of capital among localities and branches
of industry resulting from the historical development of individual
     enterprises[6]

.

Hand in hand with this is the effort to base relations with industry on
regular, lasting business connections, to

||

give expression to them and to
afford them the possibility of becoming wider and deeper by means of a
ramified system of seats on Supervisory Boards. Compared with these two
spheres of influence, the issue of stock is of relatively less importance
for the big banks’ relations with

    

the “tendency” ||||

industry.
One tendency is to make the connections with industry general; another
tendency is to make them durable and close. In the six big banks both these

|||

tendencies are realised, not in full, but to a considerable extent and to
an equal degree”
      (180)....[7]



“new” relations of industry and the banks |||

“The connections between the banks and industrial enterprises, with their
new content, their new forms and their new organs, namely, the big banks
which are organised on both a centralised and a de-centralised basis,

“scarcely before the nineties” 1897 |||

were scarcely a characteristic economic phenomenon before the nineties; in
one sense, indeed, this initial date may be advanced to the year 1897, when
the important mergers took place, and when, for the first time, the new
form of decentralised organisation was introduced to suit the industrial
policy of the banks. This starting-point could perhaps be placed at an even
later date, for it was the

crisis (1900) |||

crisis of 1900 that enormously accelerated and intensified the process of
concentration of industry and of banking, consolidated that process, for
the first time transformed the connection with industry into an actual
monopoly of the big banks, and made this connection much closer and more
active”
(181)[8]

....




| after the crisis of 1900 (depression)

...“The sudden concentration in the Rhine-Westphalian mining industry, the
formation of the Federation of Steel Plants, the mergers of the big
electric companies, etc., have undoubtedly greatly accelerated practical
solution of the question of the connections between the banks and
industry” (182)....  
 

...“Modern industry has led the banks into entirely new fields of
economic life ... the bank is to a certain extent passing from its role, in
the main, of intermediary into the sphere of industrial production.... In
this way [through the connection with industry] the big banks are in touch
not

|||| N.B.

only with development trends in individual plants, but also with the
interrelationship between the different plants of a given industry and
between different industries” (183)....  

“Anyone who has watched, in recent years, the changes of incumbents of
directorships and seats on the Supervisory Boards of the big banks, cannot
fail to have noticed that power is gradually

||| N.B.

passing into the hands of men who consider

||

the active intervention of the
big banks
in the general development of industry to be necessary and of increasing
importance. Between these new men and the old bank directors, disagreement
on this subject of a business and often of a personal nature is
growing. The issue is whether or not the banks, as credit institutions,
will suffer from this intervention in the industrial production process,
and whether they are sacrificing tried principles and assured profit to
engage in a field of activity which has nothing in common with their role
of middlemen in providing credit and which is leading the banks into a
field where they are more than ever before exposed to the blind forces of
trade fluctuations. This is the opinion of many of the older bank
directors, while most of the young men consider active intervention in
industry to be a necessity as great as that which gave rise, simultaneously
with big modern industry,

    

transition... to what?  |||

to the big banks and modern industrial banking. The two parties are agreed
only on one point: there are neither firm principles nor a concrete aim in
the new activities of the big banks”
(184)[9]

.



“Banking business with foreign countries and abroad falls into three
divisions,

1  2  3 |||

each of which corresponds to a definite stage of development: international
payments, the taking up of foreign loans? and participation in industrial
enterprises broad ... each ... has impressed its stamp on a definite period
in the foreign policy of the German big banks.  

...“On the significance of loans for German home industry, a business
manager of the Discontogesellschaft, which specialises in foreign
operations, made the following statement ten years ago to the Stock
Exchange Enquiry Commission (Proceedings of the Stock Exchange Enquiry
Commission, p. 371, statement by Russel): ‘I should consider it a very
great disadvantage if ... the floating of foreign loans in Germany was put,
not in the hands of German capital and the German banks, but in

N.B. ||||

foreign hands. It was to avoid this that the Foreign Ministry was so
greatly—and in my opinion so rightly—interested in

N.B. ||

our having commercial offices, bank branches and contacts abroad. For only
through such contacts can the desired foreign orders for German industry be
found.  

...“‘Theuniversal complaint of our export industry is that
Germany lags greatly behind London in the big-order market.

N.B.  “orders” |||

Almost all orders are concentrated in London, in this great world market,
and it is only our closer connection with individual foreign firms that
gives rise to a business

    

relationship and regular employment for industry’” (186–87)....


...“In the dealings of the German big banks with foreign industrial
enterprises,

|| two stages

we should distinguish two stages, differing in basis and in time. The
first, taken historically, coincides approximately with the flourishing
period of foreign loans and relates, therefore, to different years in
different countries: the seventies and eighties can be regarded as the
heyday of foreign railway construction” (187).

||| railways



Two subtypes (“opposite poles”): the Rumanian railways and
participation in American railways.  

“This first stage is marked by participation in foreign industry being
closely bound up with loan activity, although German home industry, as a
supplier, can derive some benefit from this.

|||

The powerful initiative of the banks is decisive, but it only indirectly
concerns industry,

|||

their main attention being devoted to profitable investments in foreign
securities. It requires a situation in which home industry is not yet so
concentrated and,

|||| since the nineties

at the same time, so expanding as it has become since the nineties.  

|| second stage

In the second stage, on the contrary, foreign loans are of less importance,
while the interest of the big banks in foreign industry increases, for this
is less dependent on other financial connections with the country
concerned. The big banks more frequently sponsor, or co-sponsor, industrial
companies in other countries and, at the same time, collaborate closely
with German home industry in foreign business operations”



(188)....  

...“In foreign expansion these [German concerns] are much more
dependent on

    

the banks than in their domestic operations.... The bank operating abroad
[in contrast to domestic operations], however, feels itself at home, has
its branches,

|||

controls international payments, and might even be connected with the
government of the given country by helping it float a loan” (189)....



4 forms |||

“Four forms of bank participation in foreign industrial enterprises can be
distinguished:
1. The formation of branches or subsidiary enterprises for German home
industry....  

...“2. The formation ... of separate foreign enterprises which are
only loosely or not at all connected with home industry.... But the really
characteristic case is afford ed by the recent exotic railway
projects and the East Asian enterprises of the big banks jointly
participating in the German-Asiatic Bank”.... This is already

my italics |

“a link in the conquest of an economic region”
(190).  

(Baghdad—China, etc. Colonies.)  

...“3. A third form is attempts by the big banks to secure a place for
themselves in an industry abroad by founding their own enterprises, or in
many cases merely by acquiring an interest in existing ones”... (191)
holdings in South African mining companies (Deutsche Bank since
1894, etc.).  

4. ...“The German banking world has

establish “its own” industry |||

also sought to secure for itself, or for German capital behind it,
exclusive exploitation of some branch of industry abroad” (192) ... for
example, the efforts “to organise under its control a part of the
oil industry, mainly the Rumanian ....  


division of the world |||

...“The world oil market is even today still divided between two great
financial groups—Rockefeller’s American Standard

    

Oil Co., and Rothschild and Nobel, who control the Russian oilfields in
Baku. The two groups are closely connected. But for several years five
enemies have been threatening their monopoly” (193); 


(1) exhaustion of the American oil sources;

(2) the competition of the firm of Mantashev & Co. in Baku;

x (3) the Austrian oilfields;

x (4) the Rumanian oilfields;

x (5) overseas oilfields, particularly in the
Dutch colonies (the extremely rich
Samuel, and Shell Transport and
Trading
Co.).[10]




[[BOX ENDS:

x = Participation of the Deutsche Bank and other German banks.

]]



...“The driving force of the banks’ activity abroad is not national
zeal but the necessity,

||| an elementary truth

which becomes ever more imperative at a certain stage of capitalist
development, of establishing abroad a favourable field for the investment
of free German capital” (197)....  

“A similar role [aid to industrial enterprises]

| technical role of the big banks (finance capital)

is played by the banks in establishing societies for technical research,
the results of which are intended to benefit friendly industrial
enterprises. Such, for example, are the Electric Railway Research
Association, the Central Bureau of Scientific and Technical Research, set
up by the Loewe concern, and the Central Mining Bureau, Ltd., in
Frankfurt-am-Main, which is financed by leading banks as well as big
industrialists”
     (210–11).[11]

 

Sometimes the banks bring various industrial enterprises
into closer association (in some cases leading to a cartel, in
others assisting specialisation, etc.)....  


||| bank = “inner connection” between enterprises

...“The bank to a certain extent embodies here the inner connection
between a large number of enterprises which results from the development of
large-scale industry; it represents the community of interests existing
between them” (215)....  

“What a rich opportunity of giving employment to friendly industrial
enterprises is afforded the Deutsche Bank by such an undertaking
as the Baghdad Railway!” (217)....  


N.B.  growth of connections ||

“However ‘incidental’, so far, the closer association has been of various
enterprises and industries through the granting of bank-sponsored orders,
it is at any rate an important symptom that with the growth of large-scale
industry the connections become more numerous,

|| N.B.

and increasingly complicated and imperspicuous. The connections and
interdependence of various industries and enterprises find in the big banks
an organ which gives them expression and more and more makes the latent
connection into a real hand-in-hand collaboration” (219)....  

!! ))

Complaints are heard of the “terrorism” of the
banks—(219–20)—they make it compulsory (for orders and so
on) to deal with a particular firm (220).

||



In the electrical industry a special role was played by the crisis
(apparently 1900), and the banks intensified and accelerated the ruin of
the relatively small enterprises and their absorption by the big ones

banks and ruin of enterprises ||

(pp. 230–32)....  “The banks refused a helping hand to the very firms in
greatest need of capital, and brought on first a frenzied

    

||

boom and then the hopeless failure of the companies which were not
connected with them closely enough”
(232).[12]



[[MINI BOX ENDS:

The Loewe group 

The Loewe sewing-machine factory, founded in 1889, added production of
armaments, then later (in the seventies and eighties) ordnance, boilers,
etc., etc., and later still electrical industry, subsidiary companies,
etc. [not very well described by Jeidels].  

In a § on the relation of the big banks to the cartels (253–58),
the author has somewhat “spread himself” and become incoherent. He
distinguishes four forms:
(1) indifference (to unimportant cartels);
(2) “definite interest” (254) in cartels such as that of the
coal industry (in cartels which are life-and-death
questions for the industry); 


||| difference from No. 2?  not “definite interest”?

(3)
“help” for a cartel, e.g., steel industry; 

(4) a purely “banking relation”—the organisation, for example, of a
“syndicate office” at the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein
(1899)....

Neue Zeit, 1913, in the other
      notebook.[13]


265 et seq., the electrical industry (see in Die Neue
     Zeit[14]

).



“The banks’ highest principle here is primarily conscious
promotion of concentration, which they have already indirectly assisted by
financial support of successful enterprises” (268)....  

“The transformation of the big banks’

||| “transformation”

industrial policy from being the policy of a credit institution to a policy
of industrial

    

|||

concentration reveals a triple contradiction in the development of modern
banking” (268)....  

||

1) ...“The fact of progressive exclusion of competition among the big
banks” (269)....  

2) “Decentralisation” of the banks (local branches and connection
with provincial

||

banks) leads to an “increasing coalescence of capitals, uniting bank and
industry into an integral whole”....  

3) ...“increasing concentration implies a more purposeful
organisation”.... (270) 

“By expansion of industrial combination, various directions of which
can be seen in the electrical and in large-scale iron and steel industries,
the sphere of this consciously guided production can be considerably
enlarged, and in this unmistakable movement the big banks are an important
factor” (270)....  

And the tendency is special patronage of heavy industry (coal
and iron) to the detriment of any other....  


N.B. ||

“The striving of the big banks for concentration and purposeful guidance
of industry is contradictory when it is restricted to certain branches of
industry and thereby results in a still greater lack of co-ordination in
other branches”
(271).[15]

    EXTRACTS  DIE BANK [2]
   

Die Bank, 1912, 2.  

“Herr von Gwinner’s Oil Monopoly” (1032—) (Dr. Felix
Pinner).  
 

|| cf.  p. 13
 here[1]

The Reichstag, on March 15, 1911, adopted almost unanimously a request for
an oil monopoly.  The government seized upon this “popular” (1032)
idea. It turned out that the banks... “could not agree on the booty”
(1033). Only the Deutsche Bank was in favour!! The others
(headed by the Discontogesellschaft) were against,
partly because they considered the Deutsche Bank’s
booty
     excessive.[2]


The struggle between the banks is useful for

sic!  ||

business: “Only when the interested parties exposed one another—and they
did so thoroughly, in a masterly way and with intimate knowledge of their
mutual weaknesses—did clarity become possible” (1034)....  

The consumers are afraid of terrific (“colossal”, 1034) prices. The
Standard Oil Co. served the consumer excellently.  

The oil trust could be fought only by an electricity monopoly,
by converting water-power into cheap electricity. But we shall get an
electricity monopoly only when this becomes profitable to the
producers.  

“But the electricity monopoly will come

||

when the producers need it, that is to say, when the next great
crash in the electrical industry is imminent, and when the gigantic,
expensive power stations now being

N.B.

put up at great cost everywhere by private electrical ‘concerns’, which are
already

sic! |||

obtaining certain franchises from towns, from states, etc., can no longer
work at a profit. Water-power will then have to be used. But it will be
impossible to

!! ||

convert it into cheap electricity at state expense; it will also have to be
handed over to a ‘private monopoly controlled

“tribute” to finance |||

by the state’, because private industry has already concluded a number of
contracts and has stipulated for heavy compensation for its expensive
steam-power plants, which

    

will impose too great a burden on the

||| capital  !!

ground-rent of a state-controlled hydro-power monopoly. So it was with the
nitrate monopoly, so it is with the oil monopoly, so it will be with the
electric power monopoly.  It is time our state socialists, who

||||

allow themselves to be blinded by a beautiful principle, understood, at
last, that in Germany the monopolies have never pursued the aim, nor have
they had the result, of benefiting the consumer, or even of
handing over to the state part of the promoter’s profits; they
have served

||

only to facilitate, at the expense of the state, the recovery of
private industries which were on the verge of
  bankruptcy”[3]

|| N.B.  N.B.

(1036, author’s italics).  

The Deutsche Bank was defeated by the Standard Oil Co. and in 1907
concluded

[MISSING "|"] there is a table of “interconnections” in oil “concerns”

with the latter (under compulsion) a very disadvantageous agreement by
which, in 1912, the Standard Oil Co. was able to buy up cheaply the
oilfields of the Deutsche Bank.  

And so the Deutsche Bank set to work to build up a monopoly!!  

Opposing the Deutsche Bank was the Discontogesellschaft
(with its Deutsche Erd\"ol Aktiengesellschaft), which worked very
cautiously for an agreement with the Standard Oil Co.

Cinema trust!!  |||

“The Patriotism of the Trusts”, by L. Eschwege: in Germany a trust
has been formed for buying up film distributors! (The firm of Pathé
(Paris) produces 80,000 metres of film daily at one mark per
metre. The cinemas of the world put together yield an income of about one
thousand million marks per year!!) (pp. 216–17). This industry lags
behind in Germany; it is especially developed in France. In Germany

    

about forty distributing agencies buy up films and “lease” them to cinema
owners. (A trust has been formed, Deutsche Filmindustrie A.-G. = Fiag,
headed by the National-Liberal Deputy Paasche. Its capital = five million
marks, of which “no small part”, obviously, was intend ed to be used as
“founders’ profit”).... A monopoly is being launched. Will it succeed??



Die Bank, 1912, 1 (p. 223 et seq.), a short article by
A. Lansburgh:
“The Financial Transactions of the Princes’ Trust” (the name
given by the Stock Exchange to the “business affairs” of Prince
F\"urstenberg and Prince Hohenlohe, wealthy financiers). They invested
millions (of their own and of the Deutsche Bank) in the
building firm of Boswau & Knauer, It raked in as much as
100,000,000 marks (!! p. 229), embarked on a host of very risky
enterprises and went bankrupt.

|| true face of the Deutsche Bank!!!

The Deutsche Bank lost about twelve million marks,
F\"urstenberg about eight million (p. 226), the whole extent of the crash
being covered and concealed (p. 226). Extremely indignant, the
author writes: “Our whole economic development is infected by some of the
Knauer poison” (230)....

|| and sic!!  “electrical concerns”

“The principle by which they (Boswau & Knauer) have worked, is hardly
different from that, for example, to which the two biggest German
electrical concerns owe their successes”
      (228)....[4]


If Boswau & Knauer had managed to wriggle out by making others bear
the risk, everyone would have praised them, and hundreds and hundreds would
have been ruined!

question of whether the people or the bureaucracy should rule is still
being debated, but the decision has already been made in favour of a third
force, namely, the plutocracy” (12) ... “political freedom becomes an
empty phrase in a country where the economic sources of wealth have become
the monopoly of a few supermen” (12). Capitalism is being etatised:
members of Zemstvos!!  (municipality, district, etc.) are being appointed
to Supervisory Boards. For example, in the Tempelhofer Feld
Aktiengesellschaft. What a shady business!!  “Petty hypocrisy”
(15)—these delegates also receive bonuses, etc., etc. “A situation which
is intrinsically dishonourable” results (16).... Government officials make
“common cause with the plutocracy” (19)....

The National City Bank (Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Co.)
controls a capital of about $1,000 million.  The Bankers Trust
Co.  (Morgan) controls a capital of about $1,500–1,750
million.  

The author points out that nowhere are banks so strictly regulated as
in America (“deposit” banks are strictly separated from “investment”
banks; branch banks are forbidden, also the loan to any one person of more
than 10 per cent of the capital, and so on). America has 26,000
“Lilliputian” banks (438)—and all to no purpose!! In reality the
multi-millionaires rule and control. A change in the laws will
merely lead to a change in the form of their rule.

A. Lansburgh, “Germany—A Rentier State”.


Deposits in German savings banks = about 16,500
million marks.  This is a transfer of capital from a latent to a
patent state, an aid to big capital, a conversion into loan
capital (mostly in mortgages).

By refraining from disposing of their money themselves, the depositors
“strengthen the power of big capital and weaken the strength of resistance
of small-scale industry” (8).

rentiers that is observed in France. But they forget that as far as the
bourgeoisie is concerned the situation in Germany is becoming more and more

Germany, output of iron 1870: 1,346,000;
1910: 14,793,000 tons.[18] 


L. Eschwege, “Plutocracy and Officialdom” (p. 825 et
seq.). Typical of a petty-bourgeois reformist. Two examples: 

“Some years ago, owing to the rigid attitude of the Rhine-Westphalian
Coal Syndicate, a strong anti-cartel movement swept through Germany. The
Reich government appointed an Enquiry Committee to study the problem of
cartels. In the course of its proceedings,

| good example!  (finance capital and the government)[19]

Government Counsellor V\"olker distinguished himself by his brilliant
mastery of the subject and his sharp business-like speeches against the
cartel representatives. Shortly thereafter, Counsellor V\"olker accepted a
highly paid post as leader of the German Steel Association, Germany’s most
powerful and closely-knit cartel organisation. With the

    

government thus deprived of its best expert, the enquiry petered out”
(827–28). There is no need, he remarks, to point to America!  

There is an Imperial Private Insurance Supervisory Office, which has
done much to control private insurance companies. And then the insurance
companies come along and entice the “controllers” with offers of
lucrative posts (including director ships).

!! |

“In recent years, no less than
three control officials have made the leap from the Imperial Supervisory
Office to a directorship in an insurance company” (831).

Die Bank, 1910, 1, p. 288. A note: “German Concessions
Abroad.”  

The Chamber of Commerce in Barmen writes in a Memorandum to
the Minister of Trade: 


   “A considerable amount of German capital is invested in
   the Transvaal gold mines, despite which, unfortunately, supplies from
   German engineering factories for the Transvaal mines

   good example of the role, significance and policy of finance
   capital |

   are only very small, because the technical management of the mines is
   predominantly in English hands. From this point of view, it would be
   extremely regrettable if the Mannesmann concessions (in Morocco)
   were to be absorbed in the French mining syndicate. If that were to happen
   the technical management of the Moroccan mines would quite certainly fall
   wholly into French hands, and there would be no prospect of supplying
   German machinery and equipment. It would be an irreparable mistake if
   German capital, while sharing in Moroccan mining enterprises, were to leave
   the technical management in French hands, just as it has been left in
   English hands in the Transvaal. The German engineering industry would not
   benefit from such an exploitation of the Mannesmann mines, and German
   capital participation would only benefit the French engineering
   industry. On the other hand, German industry would benefit immensely if
   even only a comparatively small part of the Moroccan mines were under
   German technical management”. (Quoted from pp. 288–89.)

And the editors remark that this “apparent” national
wealth should not be identified with the national wealth in general.  


From a note on the financier Eduard Engel, who died in November 1910:

 


career of bank directors ||

“Many Berlin directors only obtained their posts because their creditors
saw no other way of saving their money except by launching the debtor on a
career. While secretly cursing him for his frivolity, in public they
praised his diligence—in their own well-understood business interests”
(1202–03).  


Die Bank, 1909, 1, p. 79. A note: “The Pull of the
Bank”—government officials become directors of banks (Waldemar Muller,
von Klitzing, Helfferich, Sch\"onfeld) and in industry (V\"olker,
Budde)....  

“How about the integrity of a state official, whose secret longing is
for a cosy niche in the Behrenstrasse [the Deutsche
       Bank]?”[9]

(79).  


p. 301 et seq. Alfred Lansburgh, “The Economic Importance of
Byzantinism”—an ardent little article (petty bourgeois sentimentality)
against the plutocracy’s connection with the Kaiser, etc.  


well put! |

“We recall the journey to Palestine and the immediate result of this
journey, the construction of the Baghdad railway, that fatal ‘great product
of German enterprise’, which is more responsible for the ‘encirclement’
than all our political blunders put
     together”[10]

(307).  


Ludwig Eschwege, “Revolutionising Tendencies in
the German Iron Industry”.  


technical revolution in the iron industry ||

The main centre in Germany for ore extraction and iron has shifted from the
Rhine-Westphalian area to Lorraine-Luxemburg (in the South-West). The rich
phosphate ore (the Minette ore of Luxemburg and Lorraine) was previously of
no value. It has become excellent owing to (1) the Thomas method; (2)
electro-steel (electro-rods: 15 years’ guarantee

    

against 9 years previously).  Ores in Luxemburg-Lorraine amount to
2,000 million tons (enough for 200 years at the present rate
of German consumption) (pp. 316–17)

||



A. Lansburgh, “How Great Is the German National
Wealth?”, p. 319 et seq.  

A criticism of the well-known book by Steinmann-B\"ucher and his
estimate: 350 thousand million marks (190–200—Lexis and

|| German national wealth (350??  thousand million)

Schmoller; Great Britain—250–300, France—200–225). The chief
component figure given by Steinmann-B\"ucher (a) = 180 thousand million of
“private property in real and personal estate”—two or three
times (p. 324) the real amount, for he (Ballad p. 322), too,
overlooked this!!) took insurance policies (162.6 thousand
million, rounded off to 180!!), whereas insurance is always at the value
replacement would cost, and not the real value. “They made the
same mistake as the second-hand dealer who in taking stock listed old
furniture and clothing at the price of new” (325). And a number of other
mistakes of Steinmann-B\"ucher!!!  


Ludwig Eschwege, “Cement”, 115 et seq. (1909, 1).  


||| how do the syndicates operate?

A strongly cartelised industry. Monopoly prices (cost of production
180 marks per carload, sale price 280 marks!!, 230 marks!!). Sale
price with delivery 400 marks per carload!! Profits yield 12–16
per cent dividend.  Every effort is made to eliminate competition: false
reports of the bad situation in the industry, anonymous notices in the
press (capitalists, beware of investing your money in cement factories!!);
buying up of “outsiders” (examples: 60,000–80,000–150,000
marks in “compensation”: p.125). Cartels by regions: South
German, Upper

Crédit Lyonnais has a “Financial Research

“research service” ||||

statisticians, etc.)—costing 0.6–0.7 million francs annually
(it studies industrial enterprises, railways, etc., of various countries,
collects information, and so on). The service is divided into eight
departments:
1) industry; 2) railway and steamship companies; 3) general statistics; 4)
information on securities; 5) financial reports, etc. Cuttings from
financial news papers and journals of the whole world, and so on and so

The author draws the conclusion: 


cf. Kautsky (and Spectator) |||

“This much is certain; it is a gross error to regard foreign capital
investment, in whatever form, as a specially effective force in favour of
German products, to regard it as the pioneer of German trade” (828).  

 __  this especially N.B.!!  ||

(The author did not sum up the results, which refute him!!)  


My addition: ||

He is refuted even more emphatically by the concrete data he
himself cites on the relationship between loans and exports (Pp. 826
and
827)[14]

:




Years of loans: ||

“In 1890–91, a Rumanian loan was floated through the German
banks, which

    

|| 1890–91

had already in previous years made advances on this loan. It was used
chiefly to purchase railway materials in Germany. In
1901,[15]

German exports to Rumania amounted to 55 million marks. The following year
they dropped to 39.4 million marks and, with fluctuations, to 25.4 million
in 1900.

|| ? ?

Only in very recent years have they regained the level of 1891, thanks to
two new loans.  

|| 1888–89

“German exports to Portugal rose, following the loans of
1888–89, to 21,100,000 (1890); then, in the two following years, they
dropped to 16,200,000 and 7,400,000 and regained their former level only in
1903.  


|||

“The figures of German trade with Argentina are still more
striking.

|| 1888 1890

Loans were floated in 1888 and 1890; German exports to Argentina reached
60,700,000 marks (1889). Two years later they amounted to only 18,600,000
marks, less than one-third of the previous figure. It was not until 1901
that they regained and surpassed the level of 1889,

|| ?

and then only as a result of new loans floated by the state and by
municipalities, with advances to build power stations, and with other
credit operations.

|| 1889



“Exports to Chile, as a consequence of the loan of 1889, rose
to 45,200,000 marks (in 1892), and a year later dropped to 22,500,000
marks. A new Chilean loan floated by the German banks in 1906

|| 1906

was followed by a rise of exports to 84,700,000 marks in 1907, only to fall
again to 52,400,000 marks in 1908.”  
 


[[BOX-ENDS:

Strange that the author should not see how these facts refute him:
the rise in exports occurs precisely after the loans
and in consequence (infolge) of them.

]]



Lansburgh’s petty-bourgeois standpoint:
“And German industry would profit [if the exported capital remained at
home] not only in amount but in distribution. Capital would be distributed
freely over many branches of industry, would flow

!! |||

along numerous channels, whereas from abroad, as experience has shown, it
flows into the order books of a few privileged firms which, in addition,
have to pay dearly

gem!!  he has “persuaded” Krupp!!!

for their privileges. Krupp could tell us a thing or two about how many
millions in expenses, known as baksheesh or by some other name, have to be
paid to support

“natural”!!  ha-ha

German credit activity abroad. Yet the distribution of capital, which has
to cover as many branches of industry as possible, is of prime importance
for the whole industrial development of Germany” (824–25)....
“Production that in this way

“harmony” |||

constantly regenerates itself by its own forces [by the investment of
capital within the country] guarantees continued harmonious
    development”[16]

(p. 825).  


[[BOLD-BOX-ENDS:

The export of capital does not produce stable trade
connections: the author tries to prove this by the examples (pp. 826–27),
cited by me above: pp. 101–02 of this
      notebook[17]

]]




A. Lansburgh, “Trends in the
Modern Enterprise” (“Two books”),
   
 


||| Levy versus Liefmann

p. 1043 et seq. A short review of Levy’s
Monopolies and Trusts and Liefmann’s Financial
and Industrial Companies. Lansburgh says, rightly, that
both are one-sided: Levy’s accent is on the technical
strength of concentration, Liefmann’s on the strength of financial
(oligarchic) oppression.  

“The growing role of stocks and securities (“Effektifizierung”) in
industry vastly in creases the scale of production, reduces the number of
independent producers and makes it easier for the few—if they are not
prepared to be bought up by some giant trust—to unite in order to
suppress all newly-arising competition. Though that

| |

point is made neither by Liefmann nor

||||

Levy, it clearly emerges from both books. This might, perhaps, prompt
someone to write a book that is urgently needed:
a book that describes how a security-manipulating oligarchy has wrested
control of the republic’s economic life” (1051–52).  

Sometimes the development is through concentration to cartels (Levy has
shown this particularly clearly). But not
always. “Substitution of securities” can lead at one stroke to a
trust, e.g., “in colonial railway construction”.... Technical
concentration is progressive as regards technique; financial concentration
can strengthen, and does strengthen, the omnipotence of monopoly
capital alongside backward technique.

The figures on German iron output, written by Lenin in the margin, are
from a table in the January 1911 issue of Die Bank (p. 95), in an
item headed: “Iron and Steel Industry after 100 Years”. Lenin quotes part
of the table on p. 184 of this volume, under the heading “Recent
Statistics on the Iron Industry”.

p. 183





[19]

The data on the relations between finance capital and the governments,
and Lenin’s comments on them, were further developed in
Imperialism, and other writings. Lenin showed that the development
of monopoly and finance capital inevitably leads to a small group of
industrial and financial magnates—a financial oligarchy—playing a
decisive part in the economy and politics of the capitalist countries, the
bourgeois state, too, being wholly subordinated to it. The monopolies
subordinate and use the state machine by putting representatives of the
government on their boards of directors and by having their own
representatives enter capitalist governments. This has become a regular
practice. In the U.S.A., for example, all the top government posts are held
by men representing the main financial groups of Morgan, Rockefeller, etc.

 REMARKS ((ON FINANCE CAPITAL IN GENERAL))
   


|

Export to colonies (and financially dependent countries) versus export to
independent countries: 


[[DITTO: | ]]

Let us assume that the latter is greater and increases at a
faster rate than the former. Does this prove the “non-necessity”
of colonies and networks of financial dependence?

    

|

(K. Kautsky.) No, for
(1) even in relation to independent countries (taking all exports) the
share of cartels, trusts, dumping, increases....  


[[DITTO: | ]]

(2) Finance capital does not abolish the lower (less developed,
backward) forms of capitalism, but grows out of them, above them....  


N.B.  on finance capital and its significance ||

[[DITTO: | ]]

(3) There is a definite ratio between “normal” and monopoly sales, ergo
between “normal” and monopoly exports. Capitalists cannot help selling
staple commodities to millions of workers. Does this mean that it is
“unnecessary” for them to acquire extra-profit through government,
railway “contracts”, etc.?  


[[DITTO: | ]]

(4) The extra-profit from privileged and monopoly sales compensates for
the low profit of “normal” sales.  


[[DITTO: | ]]

(5) Compare with the banks: extra-profit as intermediaries in floating
loans, promoting bubble companies, etc., compensates for low profit
(sometimes no profit) on “normal” credit operations.  


[[DITTO: | ]]

(6) The high technique of concentrated industry and the “high
technique” of financial swindling, and the “high technique” (in reality,
low technique) of oppression by finance capital—they are inseparably
linked under capitalism. K. Kautsky wants to destroy the link,
“whitewash” capitalism, take the good and throw away the bad: “modern
Proudhonism”, petty-bourgeois reformism “under the mask of Marxism”.



[[DITTO: | ]]

ΣΣ = finance capital (monopolies, banks, oligarchy, buying
up, etc.) is not an accidental excrescence on capitalism, but its
ineradicable continuation and product.... Not merely colonies, but also
(a) export of capital; (b) monopolies; (c) a financial network of
connections and dependencies; (d) omnipotence of the banks; (e) concessions
and bribes, etc., etc.

Lenin: 1916/ni-beta: HEYMANN, COMBINED ENTERPRISES







V. I.

NOTEBOOK “β”
(“BETA”)



    

   
  HEYMANN, COMBINED ENTERPRISES


Hans Gideon Heymann, Combined
Enterprises in the German Large-Scale Iron Industry, Stuttgart, 1904
(No. 65 of Munich Economic Studies).  

A summary of data (for the most part rather fragmentary) on the
advantages of large-scale production, especially “combined” production,
i.e., uniting various successive stages....  

| a good example!!

“The representative of the Krupp firm told the iron Enquiry Committee
(Minutes (1878), p. 82): ‘I  do not think that a plant producing
20,000–30,000 tons (annually) can stand up to one producing
100,000–150,000 tons.’  Twenty-five years later Carnegie
considered that twenty times as much as 150,000 tons was
necessary. (The Empire of Business, New York, Doubleday, Page and
Co., 1902, p. 233):
‘Concerns making one thousand tons of steel per day have little chance
against one making ten thousand’” (p. 232, note).  


a condition for cartels.... ||| 

The growth of capital and its “immobilisation” (N.B.) is one of the most
important conditions for monopoly and cartels.  

“Combined enterprises often belong to more than a dozen cartels, as
V\"olker’s interesting table shows”... (249)....  


[[BOX ENDS:

? V\"olker? Iron cartels?
 December 1903 (where?) (p. 256)....

]]

—?


 

“We see ... everywhere the same spectacle in the production of
finished goods.

|| N.B.

Pure enterprises perish, are crushed between the high price of raw material
and low price of the finished product, while the combined enterprises earn
enough profit from the high prices of materials, and they find sales thanks
to the low prices of finished goods; for the big plants avoid excessive
prices for fear of inevitable subsequent reductions,

|||

whereas the small ones in good times want to push up prices wildly. Exactly
the same policy is pursued in America by the big Steel Corporation” (256).

||| N.B.



Now competition has been done away with. There remain two or three
dozen big plants. At the head are Thyssen, Lueg and Kirdorf (261). “Two
gigantic associations”: the coal syndicate and the steel syndicate ((87.5
per cent of steel output)) “must rule over the whole”.  

———Monopoly of the means of production. The land has been
bought up (coal and ore).  

|| better than in Liefmann and earlier

“The head of the concern controls the principal company [literally: the
“mother company”]; the latter reigns over the subsidiary companies
[“daughter companies”], which in their turn control still other
subsidiaries [“grandchild companies”], etc.  In this way, it is possible
with a comparatively small capital to dominate immense spheres of
production.  Indeed, if holding 50 per cent of the capital is always
sufficient to control a company, the head of the concern needs only one
million to control eight million in the second subsidiaries.  And if this
‘interlocking’ is extended, it is possible with one million to control
sixteen million, thirty-two million,
etc.”[1]

(pp. 268–69).  

The summing up: 

|

“There remain, on the one hand, the big coal companies, producing millions
of tons yearly, strongly organised in their coal syndicate,

    

and, on the other, the big steel plants, closely allied to the coal mines,
having their own steel syndicate. These giant enterprises, producing
400,000 tons of steel per annum, with a tremendous output of ore and coal
and producing finished steel goods, employing 10,000 workers quartered in
company houses and sometimes owning their own railways and ports, are the
typical representatives of the German iron and steel industry. And
concentration goes on further and further.

N.B. ||

Individual enterprises are becoming larger and larger. An ever-increasing
number of enterprises in one, or in several different industries, join
together in giant enterprises, backed up and directed by half a dozen big
Berlin banks. In relation to the German mining industry, the truth of the
teachings of Karl Marx on concentration is definitely proved; true, this
applies to a country where industry is protected by tariffs and freight
rates. The German mining industry is ripe for
   expropriation”[2]

(278–79). (The concluding words of Chapter 5 in the book.)

Hilferding’s shortcomings:



1) Theoretical error concerning money. 

2) Ignores (almost) the division of the world. 

3) Ignores the relationship between finance capital and parasitism.

Nietzsche, Friedrich (1844–1900)—reactionary German
philosopher, one of the ideologists of agrarian-bourgeois reaction. His
works reveal him as a bitter enemy of democracy, the working class and
Marxism. Nietzsche viewed social and political problems from the standpoint
of subjective idealism and vulgar “social-Darwinism”, the theory of the
“superman”. Its anti-democratic, reactionary character made Nietzscheism
the accepted philosophy of fascism. Bourgeois ideologists widely use his
theories to present imperialism as a social system that accords with
“human nature”, to justify aggression and extol predatory wars.

[[RIGHT-BOX-END:

Amateurish. A rehash of the history of Japan versus other countries

“Since that time (the Chinese war 1894–95) the Far East has become a
centre of the ambitions chiefly of France, Great Britain, Germany, Japan,
Russia and the United States, in their efforts to satisfy the wants of
‘imperial expansion’, commercial and political” (p. 256).  

“The economic activity of the Great Powers has assumed the form of
‘imperialism’, which signifies the ambition of the Great Powers to control,
for economic or political purposes, ‘as large a portion of the earth’s
surface as their energy and opportunities may permit’” (p. 269).

 PATOUILLET, AMERICAN IMPERIALISM


Joseph Patouillet, American
Imperialism, Dijon, 1904.  (Thesis.) (388 pp.)  


[[BOX ENDS:

A thesis. The frail effort of a student. Of no scientific value,
apart from abundant quotations and a summary of certain
facts. Mostly legalistic prattle; economic coverage poor.

]]



Quotes (at the start) widely known passages from Hobson
(Imperialism).  

Speaks of the fact of British imperialism (p. 33 et seq.) and
German (p. 36 et seq.) (sections I and II of Chapter II).  

A few words about Japanese and Russian imperialism (p. 39 in fine).


p. 43: “In practice imperialism means a bid for the keys of the
world—not military keys as under the Roman Empire, but the main economic
and commercial keys. It means not the rounding off of territory,

|| ?

but the conquest and occupation of the big crossroads of world trade; it
means acquiring advantageously located rather than big colonies, so as to
cover the globe with a dense and continuous network of stations, coal
depots and cables.” (Quoted from de Lapradelle: “Imperialism and
Americanism in the United States”, Revue du droit publique, 1900,
Vol. XIII, pp. 65–66. Quoted by Patouillet, p. 43.)  

Driault (Political Problems, pp. 221–22): “The
shattering defeat of Spain was a revelation.... It had seemed to be
established that international equilibrium was a matter to be settled by
five or six of the chief European powers; now an unknown quantity was
introduced into the problem” (p. 49).  

“Thus the Cuban war was an economic war inasmuch as its aim was the
seizure of the island’s sugar market; in the same way, the purpose of
annexing Hawaii and the Philippines

||

was to gain possession of the coffee and sugar produced by these tropical
countries” (p. 51). (Idem, pp. 62–63)....  
 

“Thus, the conquest of markets, the drive for tropical produce—such
is the prime cause of the policy of colonial expansion which has come to be
known as imperialism. And the colonies serve also as excellent strategic
points, the value of which we shall indicate: ... to ensure Asian markets
...  they had to have these support points”... (p. 64).

]]



Hawaii is half-way between Panama and Hong Kong.  

The Philippines are a step towards Asia and China
(p. 118). Idem 119–120–122.  

The war with Spain over Cuba was justified by pleading the interests of
freedom, the liberation of Cuba, etc. (p. 158 et seq.).  


sic! ||

The constitution calls for equality of all taxes, etc. in all the States of
the U.S.A. This has been “interpreted” as not applying to the
colonies, for these are not part, but possessions, of the
United States (p. 175).  “Gradually”, we are told, the
rights of the colonies will be enlarged (p. 190) (but equality will
not be granted)....  

Canada. Economic subordination prepares the way for political
“integration” (p. 198).  

|||

“Germany” (sic) wants to “oppose a United States
of Europe” to the United States of America (p. 205)....

||

 

|| United States of Europe[3] (and Wilhelm II)

...“Ever since 1897, Wilhelm II has repeatedly
suggested a policy of union to combat overseas competition—a policy based
on a European customs agreement, a sort of continental blockade aimed
against the United States” (205).... “In France, a European customs union
has been advocated by Paul Leroy-Beaulieu” (206)....  


||| “happy result” ||

...“An entente between the European states
would, perhaps, be one of the happy results of American imperialism”
(206).  

In America, developments have led to a struggle of the
“anti-imperialists” against the imperialists (p. 268,
Book II, Chapter I: “Imperialists and Anti-Imperialists”)....
Imperialism, he says, contradicts freedom, etc., leads to the enslavement
of the colonies, etc. (all the democratic arguments:

|||
a number of quotations). An American anti-imperialist quoted
Lincoln’s words: 

“When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when
he governs himself and also governs others, it is no longer
self-government; it is despotism” (272).  

—Phelps, United States Intervention in Cuba (New York,
1898) and others have declared the Cuban war “criminal”, etc.


Chapter III, p. 293, is headed: “Present United States Policy: the
Combination of Imperialism and the Monroe
Doctrine”[4]: both combined, and interpreted!!!  

The South Americans reject (p. 311 et seq.) the interpretation of the
Monroe Doctrine to mean that America belongs to the North
Americans. They fear the United States and want independence. The United
States has “designs” on South America and combats
Germany’s growing influence there....  

(Cf. especially Novikov in the source
     references.[1]

)



In annexing the Philippines, the United States cheated Filipino leader
Aguinaldo by promising the country independence (p. 373): “The
annexation was described as ‘Jingo
       treachery’”.[2]

In South America there is a growing trend towards closer relations
with Spain; the (Spanish American) congress in Madrid in
1900 was attended by delegates from fifteen South American states (p. 326)
(*).  More contacts with Spain, growth of the latter’s influence and of
“Latin” sympathies, etc. (**)

[3]

The “United States of Europe” slogan, in its different variations,
gained particularly wide currency during the First World War. It was
vigorously boosted by bourgeois politicians and the Kautskyites,
Trotskyists and other opportunists. In the political manifesto of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, “The War and Russian Social-Democracy”,
published in Sotsial-Demokrat on November 4, 1914, Lenin stressed
that “without the revolutionary overthrow of the German, the Austrian and
the Russian monarchies” it was a false and meaningless slogan

(see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 33).

In his well-known article “On the Slogan for a United States of Europe”,
published August 23, 4915, Lenin wrote that “a United States of Europe,
under capitalism, is either impossible or reactionary” (ibid., p. 340),
and this was fully substantiated by his economic analysis of imperialism.

p. 211





[4]

Monroe Doctrine—a declaration of United States’ foreign
policy principles formulated by President James Monroe in a message to
Congress on December 2, 1823. Based on the “America for Americans”
slogan, the doctrine has been used by the U.S. as a cover for its
colonialist plans in Latin America, for constant interference in the
affairs of Latin American countries, the imposition of shackling treaties,
the establishment and support of anti-popular regimes subservient to the
U.S. monopolists, and aid for these regimes in their struggle against the
national liberation movement.

|| 50 persons

“For a seat on the board, one need only hold 50–200–300
shares.... Thus, about 50 persons, who need not have more than eight
million francs
between them, year after year control more than 2,500 million
francs of deposits, and more than 1,500 million francs of new
annual investments, without having to give account to anyone” (252).  

In the case of loans, the borrowing state never receives more than 90
per cent (p. 253)—the banks get the remainder.  The 1895 Chinese-Russian
loan was for 400 million francs at 4 per cent.  “The price on flotation
was 450. The first market price was 495. The highest market price was
520. The difference in one month was 45 francs, or 10 per cent.... On this
deal, the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas alone made a profit of 20 million
francs” (253), and so on.

investment in Russian loans:

LYSIS, AGAINST THE FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY
   IN
     FRANCE[1]


Lysis, Against the Financial Oligarchy in
France, 5th ed., Paris, 1908 (260 pp.). The chapters are dated
November 1, 1906; December 15, 1906; February 1, 1907; May 1, 1907;
November 15, 1907.  

In the preface, Jean Finot states that the British press has confirmed
the fact reported by Lysis (first in La Revue): A certain
person made 12 million francs (p. vii) out of the 1906 Russian
loan, besides “a hundred million” (ibidem) in commissions!!



Date?? |||

This was discussed at a sitting of the Chamber of Deputies (two days)
(when?).  

Four banks have an “absolute monopoly” (p. 11) (not a relative
one)—in all bond issues.

etc.)—p. 26.

“The French are the usurers of Europe” (29)....  

“The financial press almost always enjoys subsidies” (35).  

The Egyptian Sugar Refineries Affair: the public lost 90–100 million
francs (39). The Société Générale issued 64,000
shares of this company; the price on issue was about 150 per cent
(!!).... The company’s dividends were “fictitious”
(39)....  

“One of the Société Générale
directors was a director of Egyptian Sugar Refineries” (39).

||| !!



Fifty persons, representing eight million francs, control 2,000
million francs in these four banks (40)....  

What is to be done? “Return to competition” (42)....  

“The French Republic is a financial monarchy” (48)....  

The 1906 Russian loan: Mr. X, “an intermediary of the banks”, made
12 million (49).  

It is impossible to understand anything from the reports and
balance-sheets....  

“1,750 million in three lines” (57)....  

What is the source of bank profits? Stock issues. This is
concealed.  

“An example: without a prospectus, without publicity,
secretly, by the muffled and hidden work of its ‘cashiers’ and
‘business agents’, the Crédit Lyonnais sold 874 million francs worth
(nominal value) of Russian Nobility Land Bank bonds. At an average price of
96.80. The market price at present is 66. The loss to the public: 269
million francs!” (pp. 75–76)....  

“Alarming export of French capital” (p. 93 et seq.).  

France is the “world’s usurer” (119).  

The fall in the market price of Russian bonds (as against the price of
issue) is such that out of 14,000 million francs, 3,000–4,000
million are lost by the public: that is what the public pays the banks!!!

 

And endless wailing about the banks not supporting
French industry.... Germany is advancing, we are marking time (187
and passim)... “anti-national policy”, etc.  

Chapter V is headed: 

“Complete Domination of the Financial Oligarchy; Its Hold over the
Press and the Government”....  

The banks’ means of pressure on the government: lowering the rate of
interest... (!!)

 secret subsidies:

    1 million to a Minister

} !

    1/4 million to an ambassador (p. 212)

[DITTO:] } !

    bribes to the press...

      (Has used only newspaper articles, nothing else).  

Author’s conclusions: regulation of banking

    separation of banks of deposit from banks of issue
(d’affaires)

    control....

 ((A commonplace philistine))

      BÉRARD, BRITAIN AND IMPERIALISM


Victor Bérard, Britain and
Imperialism, Paris, 1900. (381 pp.)  

 {{ 

Cursory examination suggests a collection of newspaper articles: glib,
extremely glib, journalism, but extremely superficial. Descriptive account,
nothing more. “Joseph Chamberlain” is the heading of the first
chapter. Quotations from his speeches, his career, fame, etc.,
etc. “Imperialism” forms the second chapter (or section: they are not
called chapters nor are they numbered). This too is a “newspaper”
account: “Markets, markets”, endless examples and figures

    

(on the decline of British trade, etc.) from Blue Books, but it is all
fragmentary, superficial, and after Hobson and Schulze-Gaevernitz reads
like a schoolboy’s exercise—book.... Ditto about German competition, and
so on and so forth. Nil. Nil.

 }} 



[DITTO:]  {{ 

A couple of examples which, possibly, might be useful:

[DITTO:]  }} 


Some of the arguments against imperialism: 

“The same statistics prove further that the occupation of a territory
by His Majesty’s troops often benefits only foreigners and very little
British subjects; in Egypt only German and Belgian trade has increased
since 1881: British imports to Egypt amounted to £8,726,000 in 1870;
£3,060,000 in 1880; £3,192,000 in 1892; £4,435,000 in
1897, whereas German imports rose from £E21,000 (Egyptian £ =
25.60 francs) in 1886 to £E281,000 in 1896, and Belgian imports rose
from £86,000 to £458,000 in the same period” (p. 249).  

“Having invented the extraction of sugar from beet, France became the
world’s leading sugar producer: she still had a monopoly in 1870, when
Germany entered the field. A study of the French crops showed that, like
Northern France, she had a favourable soil and climate in areas near her
coal mines. But her soil was less fertile and her climate more severe. The
fight against the French would have to be waged on unequal
terms. Nevertheless, by 1882, French sugar manufacturers were already
complaining:
German sugar is penetrating the French market.... German beet has a 12
per cent sugar content; French growers say they cannot obtain more than 7
per cent”—the Germans had improved cultivation methods, fertilisers,
selection, etc., etc.  

“In less than twelve years of German competition, France, which
invented beet sugar, was deprived of the profit from her invention. Her
sugar law of 1884 was dictated by German science, Germany being henceforth
the empress of sugar, and, in addition, of alcohol” (pp. 311–12).

     LAIR, GERMAN IMPERIALISM


Maurice Lair, German Imperialism,
Paris, 1902 (341 pp.)  



 [    
  Begins with a brief, routine description of
    British imperialism, then
    American, Russian, Japanese, and German (“Imperialism and
    Imperialists”. Introduction).
  
 ] 
 Nil 


 Chapter I. “The Origin of German Imperialism.” 


 
 (1870.—Development and growth. Generally known data
    and figures. Much the
    same “journalistic” account as
    V. Bérard’s.)
  


 Chapter II. “The Soul of Imperialist Germany”...  


 
 and the “Herr
Doktor”—and Mommsen and Treitschke ... drawing-room gossip!—-and a
little quotation from Marx (requoted from Bourdeau).... Wretched piece of work.
 


 Chapter III. “Imperialist Policy.” 




ha-ha!! ||


 ...“The twentieth century inaugurates
the reign of the barons of the big
banks” (165)—and a quotation from Toussenel: “The Jews—the
Kings of the Era” (!!).
 


 Chapter IV. “Yesterday.” More and more
  


 
 figures on Germany’s economic growth. The Baghdad railway, etc.
 


 Chapter V. “Today.”—On the crisis of 1900,  


 
 prattle.... 


 Chapter VI. “Tomorrow.” 


 
 ...Resolution of the Paris International Socialist Congress,
  September 1900—“against imperialism” (p. 324)
and wars....


A bit of everything!...

    BRIEFS, THE ALCOHOL CARTEL


Goetz Briefs, The Alcohol
Cartel, Karlsruhe, 1912.  (Baden Higher School Studies. New
series, No. 7.)  It seems—at a glance—to be a specialised,
uninteresting work.  


[PARTIAL LEFT BOX END:]

Monopoly

[[

pp. 240–41: “Thus de facto the ring of alcohol plants [there remain three
“outsiders”, quite weak] has become a monopoly centred around the almost
completely syndicated potato distilleries; this completes the external
power structure of the cartel.”

NOTEBOOK “γ”

RUSSIER, THE PARTITION OF OCEANIA


Henri Russier, The Partition of
Oceania, Paris, 1905. (Thesis.)  

A very detailed summary of a mass of material.
Unfortunately, there are no exact statistical totals (à la
Supan). Well compiled. Many source references, maps, photographs.  

Author divides the history of the “political partition” into periods:


 1) discovery (16th–18th centuries) 
 2) missions (1797–1840) 
 3) “first conflicts” (1840–70) 
 N.B. |||

4) “international competition”, 1870–1904. 



{{

Author quotes, inter alia, the summary table (of the partition) from
Sievers and K\"ukenthal, Australia, Oceania and the Polar
Countries, Leipzig, 1902. Pp. 67–68.  To be looked
at.

}}



This is followed by detailed economic, commercial and
geographical information about each of the colonies.  

To the economic causes of colonial policy the author adds
(N.B.)—social causes: 
 

“To these [enumerated above and well-known] economic causes must be
added social causes.—Owing to the growing complexities of life, which
weigh heavily not only on the masses of the workers, but also on the middle
classes,

gem!!  ||

one sees accumulating in all countries of old civilisation ‘impatience,
rancour and hatred that are a menace to public order, declassed energies
and turbulent forces, which must be taken in hand and given employment
abroad in order to avert an explosion at
  home’”[1]

(Wahl, France in Her Colonies, Paris, p. 92)—(pp. 165–66).



N.B. |||

References to British imperialism (p. 171);—to
American (p. 175), after the Spanish-American war of
1898;—to German (p. 180).

He quotes, among others, Driault, Political and Social Problems at the
End of the Nineteenth Century, etc. (Paris, 1900), Chapter XIV, “The

     VOGELSTEIN, CAPITALIST FORMS OF ORGANISATION
    IN
 MODERN BIG INDUSTRY


Theodor Vogelstein, Capitalist Forms
of Organisation in Modern Big Industry, Vol. I: “Organisational Forms
of the Iron and Textile Industries in Great Britain and America”, Leipzig,
1910.  

pp. 54–56.  

The British firms: Vickers, Son and Maxim, Ltd.; Browns; Cammels, now
own (iron ore) mines, coal mines, iron and steel plants, shipyards, several
explosives factories, etc., etc.  
 

The Rail Cartel: 


||| Division of the world: 1884

“During the very severe depression of 1884, British, Belgian and German
rail firms agreed on a division of export business, on the understanding
that there would be no competition in their home markets. At first Great
Britain was allotted 66 per cent, Belgium 7 per cent and Germany 27
per cent of the exports; later the figures were somewhat modified in favour
of the continental countries. India was reserved entirely for Great
Britain.... The British firms divided their share among themselves and
fixed a price which enabled plants working under unfavourable conditions to
continue in operation.... Joint war was declared against a British firm
remaining outside the cartel, the cost of which was met by a levy of two
shillings on all sales.

||| 1886

But when two British firms
retired from the cartel, it
   collapsed”....[1]

(quoted from the edition of 1886).... “Twenty years elapsed
before a new international association was formed. In spite of all efforts,
it was impossible, during these decades of rapid industrial development on
the continent and in America, to reach agreement on territorial limits and
quotas....  


||| 1904

“In 1904 an agreement was at last reached with Germany, Belgium and France
on the basis of 53.50 per cent, 28.83 per cent and 17.67 per cent for the
first three countries” (sic?? Britain, Belgium, Germany??). “France took
part with 4.8 units in the first year, and 5.8 and 6.4 units in the second
and third years, in a total amount which

    

was increased by these percentages, hence in 104.8, 105.8 and 106.4 units.


“In 1905 an agreement was reached also with the United States, and in the
following year ... Austria and the

[ DOUBLE BOX:

Altos Hornos plants in Spain were brought
into the alliance. At the present time, the division of the world is complete,
and the big consumers, primarily the state railways—since the world has
been parcelled out without consideration

[ DOUBLE BOX: good example!! ]

for their interests—can now dwell like  the poet in the
heavens of
Jupiter”[2]

(pp. 99–100).


As regards the United States Steel Corporation, it is still an open question
whether Charles Schwab is right in maintaining that the iron ore mines of Lake
Superior (mostly bought up by the Steel Corporation) will soon be the
only ones left—or whether Carnegie is right in thinking that many
ore deposits will still be found in America.


The share of the Steel Corporation in American output (p. 275):

## Driault









Lenin: 1916/ni-gamma: DRIAULT, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS







V. I.  

      Lenin
NOTEBOOK “γ”
(“GAMMA”)



    

   
      DRIAULT, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS


J. E. Driault, Political and Social
Problems, Paris, 1907.  

((A general historical sketch of the “problems”: Alsace-Lorraine,
Rome and the Pope, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, the Mediterranean, Egypt, the
“Partition of Africa”, China, the United States (Chapter XI and its
subsection: “Imperialism in the United States”), the Triple Alliance; the
Franco-Russian Alliance, Chapter XIV, see my
      quotation,[1]

Chapter XVI “The Social and Moral Problem”. Mostly the remarks of a
historian and “diplomat”.))  

From “Conclusion”:



   “The present time is, in fact, marked by universal
   tension, in which the existing

    

   state of peace is merely a truce, which many find too long and which many
   do not observe. The world is seized by a strange fever of imperialism, by
   fierce cupidities arising on all sides and shamelessly allowed to take
   effect.

   ||

   Society is shaken by the struggle of classes, everywhere violently
   conducted and hardly mitigated in recent times. Even the human mind is
   upset by doubts and the need for certainty.  


   ||

   “Mankind is in the throes of revolution—a territorial revolution, a new
   delimitation of frontiers, an assault on the great markets of the world,
   armaments up to the hilt, as if people were going to hurl themselves at one
   another tomorrow, for mutual ruin and extermination—a social revolution
   based on the worst feelings, the hatred of the

   |||| cf.  K. Kautsky 1909

   poor for the rich, the contempt of the rich for the poor, as if society
   were still divided into free men and slaves, as if it had not altered since
   olden times—a moral revolution, a laborious transition from faith to
   science, painful anguish for people of sensitive conscience, the hard
   necessity for the churches to renounce controlling people’s souls in order
   to devote themselves to educating them.—A profound revolution, the
   outcome of that of the preceding century, but much more severe because of
   its incalculable consequences: for at issue is not only the political
   organisation of states, but the material and moral condition of mankind”
   (393–94).  



((And then platitudes: the nineteenth century accomplished much, it
liberated nationalities, etc., etc., but it left much to be done. “For
this (19th) century was a century of science, but it put it at the service
of force.” The next century must be a “school of justice”, etc., etc. A
liberal, nothing more. That makes his admissions all the more
characteristic: he senses the storm.))

analysis




Examination of part of the chapters (x) shows that the author cites
interesting excerpts from laws indicating growth of independence
in these British colonies, which have almost attained the
position of free countries. Nevertheless, they are dependent
countries, says the author, since they do not enjoy full freedom
(though development is obviously in that direction....)  


[BOX ENDS:]

[[

separation is spoken of freely.

 Agreement with Britain on legislation.

[BOX:]

[[

Use for comparing imperialism (economic) and political independence.

]]



Things are moving towards free federation. Britain has
granted parliamentarism, the author concludes, which she is now combining
with “the organisation of a federal state” (p. 347). The South African
parliament has authority to alter colony frontiers, unite several colonies
into one.

    

“But only at the request of the colonies concerned” (339)....  

In Australia, parliament can divide colonies into smaller units, can
merge colonies—“but only with the consent of the population concerned,
or of its parliament” (p. 335).

|| N.B.




((

there were plebiscites; the drafting of a constitution with the consent of
all the colonies—by agreement with Britain....

))



p. 330, a note, Mr. Dibbs (an Australian) spoke freely of
secession from Britain and the formation of an independent
Australian republic....

Notes
 
 



[1]

“Imperialist Economists”—an opportunist trend in the
international Social-Democratic movement which made its appearance during
the First World War. In the R.S.D.L.P. it came out in the open at the Berne
Conference of the Party’s sections abroad in the spring of 1915, when
N. I. Bukharin put forward theses defending anti-Marxist views, which Lenin
subsequently described as “imperialist Economism”. Bukharin’s theses were
later supported by G. L. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosh. Similar ideas were
expressed in the Draft Programme o? the Revolutionary-Socialist Association
and Social-Democratic Labour Party of Holland, in the American Socialist
Labour Party, and in other parties. Lenin called “imperialist Economism”
an international malady and launched a vigorous campaign against it. The
“imperialist Economists” opposed self-determination of nations and the
entire R.S.D.L.P. minimum programme, which envisaged a struggle for
democratic changes. Lenin stressed the great significance of the national
self-determination slogan in the era of imperialism. Marxists, he
emphasised, should use all democratic institutions to prepare the overthrow
of the bourgeoisie. “Through utilisation of bourgeois democracy to
socialist and consistently democratic organisation of the proletariat
against the bourgeoisie and against opportunism”

(see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 27).



Lenin’s criticism of “imperialist Economism” can be found in his
works: “The Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism”; “Reply to
P. Kievsky (Y. Pyatakov)”; “A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist
Economism” (ibid., pp. 13–21, 22–27, 28–78) and in other writings.

      NOTES FOR ARTICLES “THE ‘DISARMAMENT’ SLOGAN”
       AND “THE MILITARY PROGRAMME
   OF THE PROLETARIAN
     REVOLUTION”[1]


“Disarming is emasculation. Disarming is a reactionary-Christian
jeremiad. Disarming is not a struggle against the imperialist
reality, but a flight from it into the beautiful future
after the victorious socialist revolution!!” (cf. Victor
Fischer)....  

“Militarisation of the nation” , “an armed people”, what a
misfortune!—one hears this more and more frequently. But we say:
militarisation of the nation, an armed people, drawing children and, if you
like, women, into military training—so much the better, the
speedier will the war be turned into a civil war, into an uprising. Help?
No, we will not help the trusts.  

Disarmament instead of arming the people.  
    

    

1. The voice of the small countries. 

2. Against all war? 

3. National war. 

4. “Theses.” 

5. Civil war. 

6. Socialist war. 

7. The oppressed class? 

8. Concession to opportunism? 

9. No opportunism and Kautskyism here. 

10. Militarisation of the nation. 

11. Commune. 

12. First, the fight against opportunism and Kautskyism. 

13. Second, a concrete programme. 

14. Third, practical “demands”. 

15. Two lines of policy in Switzerland. 


To the question “Militia or disarmament?”  

I. Disarmament or disarming of the people or something
similar?  (instead of a militia).  

II. The oppressed class has not sought to study and master the art of
war?  (Engels in Anti-D\"uhring, on militarism on the way to
destruction).[2] 

III. Concession to opportunism, or the ease of slipping into
opportunism?  

Not here, not in this.  




+ attempts to avoid
revolution
 
 || 

All democratic changes facilitate this.  (The
republic. Separation of the church from the state, etc.).... Exception
(America)....
 



General struggle, all along the line, against overt and masked opportunism
(Kautskyism).
 



+ imperialism in Switzerland
(Nakhimson)
 

Press down on the enemy (opportunism)
everywhere. Changes in programme. No
to Swiss militia (especially after 1907).
 




IV. Practice. Formulas or revolutionary practice? Now, at this
moment—propaganda of disarmament or disarming? Nonsense! Help the
revolutionary struggle in neighbouring countries, turn the imperialist war
into a civil war. 20,000 x 2 pfennigs = 20,000 francs per annum. Three
newspapers, their delivery.

[2]

Engels in Anti-D\"uhring, Part II, Chapter III, “The Force
Theory (Continuation)”, writes as follows about the capitalist states: =

“The army has become the main purpose of the state, and an end in itself;
the peoples are there only to provide soldiers and feed them. Militarism
dominates and is swallowing Europe. But this militarism also bears within
itself the seed of its own destruction. Competition among the individual
states forces them, on the one hand, to spend more money each year on the
army and navy, artillery, etc., thus more and more hastening their
financial collapse; and, on the other hand, to resort to universal
compulsory military service more and more extensively, thus in the long run
making the whole people familiar with the use of arms, and therefore
enabling them at a given moment to make their will prevail against the
war-lords in command.... At this point the armies of the princes become
transformed into armies of the people; the machine refuses to work, and
militarism collapses by the dialectics of its own evolution”.

PAUL LOUIS, OUTLINE OF IMPERIALISM


Le Mercure de France, Vol. 50, April,
Paris, 1904.  

Paul Louis, Outline of Imperialism,
p. 100 et seq.  


||

“Imperialism is a general phenomenon of our age; more, a characteristic
feature of the early twentieth century, and few nations have been able to
avoid its influence.  

“The world is passing through the era of imperialism, just as it has
experienced the crises of liberalism, protectionism, colonialism,—just as
it has experienced the collective effort of nationalities, just as in the
last ten years it has witnessed the universal spread and increasing growth
of socialism.

||

All these elements, all these aspects of the life of mankind, are closely
linked, and imperialism and socialism to a very large extent form the
fundamental contradiction of our age. To show up this contradiction amounts
practically to defining the essential principles of both” (100).  

...“Imperialism is equally triumphant in Britain and the U.S.A., in
Japan and the Russian Empire, in Germany, France and Italy” (100–01)....


“It [imperialism] emerges everywhere as capitalism’s supreme effort to
preserve its wealth, political domination, social authority. This involves
territorial conquest, forcible or peaceful extension of possessions,
closure of markets, creation of a closed empire” (101).  

The wars of 1820–48 were bound up “with the formation of the great
German and Italian nationalities” (102)....  

...“Imperialism combines colonialism and protectionism” (105)....


“It [imperialism] should above all be studied in Great Britain, for
there it has found its Promised Land” (106)....  

But alongside Great Britain there has developed 

(1) the competition of France, Germany, America and Japan; 

(2) the struggle for colonial markets (of Europe and the colonial
countries themselves); 

(3) the merchant fleet of other countries.  


||

“Imperialism arose from these three established facts”

 (Chamberlain’s campaign. Imperial federation, etc.).  
 

The same applies to the United states—Russia—Germany—Japan (109).


(Hence—the aggravation of nationalism, etc.)  

“Nationalism, which merges with imperialism”...  carries the threat
of war, etc. (112).  

But these wars “will deal irreparable blows to the social institutions
of participating countries” (113).  

It will lead to the formation of gigantic empires—to growing
discontent among the workers (113), the “mob”... (113) (rising living
costs, etc., etc.).  

“The capitalist world regards imperialism, its last card, as the last
refuge against the bankruptcy and spontaneous disintegration that threatens
to engulf it with fatal certainty. But imperialism is also a remarkable,
incomparable, artisan of revolution” (114).

STEFFEN, WORLD WAR AND IMPERIALISM


Gustaf F. Steffen, World War and
Imperialism. Socio-Psychological Documents and Observations of the World
War 1914–15, Jena, 1915. (Translated from the Swedish.)  

(p. 3): “Imperialism is as old as the history of the world”....  


|| &arrow

“In its most general features, imperialism is an endeavour to
build a great world state by conquest or colonisation or the peaceful
political

    

| &downarrow !!?  ha-ha!!

union of already existing states, or by a combination of these methods; to
build a world power which embraces the whole of mankind or which divides
mankind between itself and some other world states” (4)....  The concept
of “the whole world” depends on the given people’s

||

“knowledge” of the earth, etc. “Imperialism is a purely psychical
factor” (4).  


[DITTO:] ||

“Social fantasy is the mother of imperialism” (5).  

Imperialism has its history. “There is primitive imperialism and
higher, more mature imperialism” (6).  

Caesar,—Napoleon, etc., etc.  


|||

Present-day “imperialism of partition” (partition of the
world) in contrast to ancient “mono-imperialism” (a single
monarchy)—(p. 15)....  

On p. 14 the author promises to examine the
“special” features of “present-day” “European
imperialism”....  

The world is divided among ten empires ... (p. 15) and fifty other
independent states....  



 1.  
 Russia  
 }} 
 with mono-imperialist
    “dreams of the future”.... 
 }} 
 “semi-European” states 


 2.  
 Great Britain 


 

(their characteristic feature being vast possessions
    outside Europe).
 


3.  
 France—likewise of “somewhat lower
  imperialist rank”
  (16).... 


 

(“empires with extra-European orientation”). 


4.  
 Japan.


5.  
 Turkey—a weak empire.


6.  
 China—a “dormant empire” (17) ... “Chinese
  imperialism” will still have to be reckoned with in the future
  (17)....


7.  
 Germany.



  —the war centres on her “imperialist position and power”.... 


8.  
 Austria-Hungary.


9.  
 Italy (“an imperialist newcomer”, 18).... 


10.  
 United States.




What part of the world is “imperialised”?  
 

Σ of these ten empires = 96.66 million square kilometres = 66% of
the world. South America = 18.6 million sq. kilometres = 13% of the world
(p. 18).  

The author gives (H\"ubner’s) totals (sq. km. and population) of all
these states. Σ = 96.662 million sq. km. and 1,399,689,000
population.

 The whole world (145,918,000 sq. km.) (1,657,097,000 population).


The Entente (68,031,000 sq. km.) (777,060,000 population)

 Germany

 + Austria

 + Turkey 5,921,000 ” ” 150,199,000 ”




It is all clearly a matter of “psychical” (25) factors!!  


| well said!

...“The world is now almost completely ‘divided up’. But world history
teaches us that empires tend to divide up each other after they
have more or less divided among themselves the ‘no-master’ areas in all
parts of the globe” (37).  

(a detailed paraphrase of Seeley....)  

Present-day British and French imperialism—like that of Spain,
Holland, Portugal, France and Great Britain in the 16th, 17th and 18th
centuries—is “West-European imperialism based on overseas colonisation”
(43).  

Russia is different. Russia is more an Asiatic country. It is in the
interest of all Europe to seal itself off from Asia.

| Germanophile!!

The Great Russians=a mixture with Asiatics; the frontier of Europe=the
frontier of the Great Russians (p. 50).  The alliance of France and Great
Britain with Russia is an alliance against “the general vital
interests of all Europe” (51).  

Incidentally: p. 46, remarks that

||| “Swedish” imperialism

Sweden is “a former Great Power, dethroned by Russia herself”.  


|| favours.  German imperialism

Nothing could be more legitimate than the foundation (1871) of the German
Empire. Great Britain, France and Russia consider it their “right” to
dismember and enfeeble Germany!! (56).  
 


imperialism = a law of history! ||

“Imperialism is a universal [sic!] political stage of development, through
which every [!!] great people with large internal forces and a momentous
mission must pass” (56–57).  

Percentage and per capita expenditure on the army and navy is less in
Germany than in France and Great Britain (58). The “legend” (59)
of Germany’s excessive “militarisation”!  


||

“This cause [of the 1914–15 world catastrophe], it seems to me, lies in
the relative weakness rather than the relative strength of Germany”
(60).... From the standpoint of Russia + Great Britain + France, a
“preventive war” was necessary”....




“True, modern economic imperialism and imperialist expansion are
possible to a certain extent even without the direct acquisition of
territories in other parts of the world, which we call
‘colonisation’. Capital, traders and entrepreneurs are dispatched, railways
and canals are constructed, huge regions in all parts of the world are made
accessible to modern capitalist development, and in this way, spheres of
economic influence, or spheres of domination, in other parts of the world
are acquired without direct seizure of territory or political conquest.



aha!  |

“Undoubtedly, German imperialism has hitherto, employed, to a
considerable extent, these more peaceful methods of
expansion. This could be, but might not be, merely preparation for colonial
acquisitions in the previous sense” (62).  

It has been aimed chiefly at Asia Minor and Mesopotamia—areas
not belonging to the British Empire.  

Great Britain seeks to deprive Germany of just that
development which she herself extensively enjoys + France + Russia
(62–63).  

“The world war of 1914–15 is therefore really a world war—a war to
give the new German Empire a share in ruling the world, a war in which the
leading role is played by the mistress of the world, Great Britain, while
the two next most powerful world powers—Russia and France—are
interested participants” (63).  
 

Great Britain + France + Russia = 46% of the earth and 43% of its
population; + the U.S.A. + Germany = 55% and 53% (p. 68).... “In other
words, the world is actually divided between some few states” (69)....


Seeley—1883 (The
Expansion...)....  

Charles Dilke—1890 (Problems of
Greater Britain).  

There should be three empires: Great Britain + the United States +
Russia.  

France and Germany “pygmies” (!!)  (p. 71).  

James Anthony
Froude—1885 (Oceania or England and Her Colonies).


The Empire and the Century, 1905 (a
symposium of 50 authors).  

The following is from the introductory article by W. F. Monnypenny
“The Imperial Ideal”: 

“Today the words ‘Empire’ and ‘Imperialism’ fill the place in everyday
speech that was once filled by ‘Nation’ and ‘Nationality’... the national
ideal has given place to the Imperial” (72)....  

Imperialism (Rome!) is older than “nationalism” (72–73). But
“modern” imperialism is based “to a very large extent” on
nationalism (73)....  

J. A. Cramb, Germany and
England, 1913.... (“Germany is our worst enemy”....) For a
standing army.... “All England’s wars for the past five hundred years have
been fought for empire”. (79).... Alliance with Russia is
“unnatural” (80)....  


| true!

“Bluntly stated, what it amounts to is that, in her general development,
Germany is now vastly superior to France, Russia and Japan, and she
alone can in the future present a real threat to Britain’s world
domination, and especially to her command of the seas. Hence an agreement
between Britain and the three Great Powers mentioned was incomparably
easier than one with Germany” (85).  

Endless prattle—quotations from Trubetskoi—the German Chancellor is
more moral than Lloyd George, etc., etc. Chauvinist blather!
Pithy quotations from George Bernard Shaw on British hypocrisy
(120–23), etc.

|||

But Shaw, he says,

    

!!! |||

has written a host of articles [inter alia in The New
Statesman] on the need to “smash up” Germany (p. 128).  

One of the causes is failure to “understand” one another
(136);—education in a spirit of “national prejudices” (137).

 — — — Peace requires the shedding of national “independence”
(138) (= the right to make war), etc., etc.  

Quotations from Bernhardi ... he accuses his nation of lacking
bellicosity (!!)  ... and from Rohrbach (he, too, is “moderate”!
(p. 150), Rohrbach’s “humane (!!!) guiding impulses”).

— — What a banal type, this Steffen!...  


! |||

German imperialism is “defensive rather than aggressive” (157).  


ha-ha!! ||

Germany is waging a “defensive” war (158)—it is “ludicrous”
to think that she would have chosen for an attack “such a wildly
unfavourable situation as the present one”, etc., etc. German imperialism
is “profoundly cultural, socially constructive”, etc. (163).  


[DOUBLE BOX ENDS:]

[[

This book, which promised something in the beginning, degenerates into the
most vulgar Germanophile chauvinism! N.B.

]]



The diplomatic documents are extremely confused—in all
countries there were (some) diplomats for war,—the military,
too, intervened (powerfully).... “The causes of the 1914–15 world war can
be established only by studying world history” (180)....  

And further, right to the end (p. 254), Germanophile quotations from
well-known “books”... Nil! Nil! Not worth the trouble reading this
“Dreck”!

Lenin: 1916/ni-delta: KAUTSKY, 1914 AND 1915 (ON IMPERIALISM, WAR, AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY)







V. I.  

      Lenin
NOTEBOOK “δ”
(“DELTA”)



    

   
  KAUTSKY, 1914 AND 1915
(ON IMPERIALISM, WAR, AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY)
   

K. Kautsky, “Imperialism”,
Die Neue Zeit, 1914, 2 (32nd year), p. 908 et seq. No. 21
(September 11, 1914).  

((A note to the article says it was written before the war, for the
Congress, and has been slightly altered.))  


? ||

It is not uncommon now to “identify with imperialism all the phenomena of
present-day capitalism—cartels, protection, the domination of the
financiers, and colonial policy” (908). In that case we have “the
flattest tautology”, in that case “imperialism is naturally a vital
necessity for
    capitalism”[1]

(908).  

The term, he says, must be taken “not in this generalised sense, but
in its historical determination” (909), as in Britain, i.e., “as
a special kind of political strivings”.

?  Hobson!  ||

“The British understand” (909) by imperialism the striving, on the one
hand, to unite all parts of the empire with the metropolis, and, on the
other, to extend the empire....  

“Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial
capitalism. It consists in the striving

    

| no good at all

of every industrial capitalist nation to bring under its control or to
annex ever bigger areas of agrarian [Kautsky’s italics] territory,
irrespective of what nations inhabit
them”[2]

(909)....  

Further, he discusses the “production proportion” (heading of
§ 1) between agriculture and industry, between means of production and
means of consumption.  

§ 2: “Simple commodity production” (blather, old stuff).  

§ 3: “Capitalist production”: capitalist industry requires that
“the agricultural area serving it as supplier and purchaser” should
“constantly expand” ((slipshod!)).  

§ 4: “Accumulation and imperialism.”  

The contradiction between industry and agriculture finds dual
expression (917): 

(1) over-production (in industry)....  

(2) high costs (of raw materials and staple products)....  

Imperialism was preceded by the “form” (striving for expansion) of
free trade: “half-a-century ago it, too, was considered the last word in
capitalism, as imperialism is today” (917)....  

Free trade helped develop other countries (the United States + Europe);
their protectionist policy:
in place of the division of labour between British industry and the
agriculture of all other countries, “they” (the other countries)
“divided up the still free agrarian regions of the world among the big

|||| N.B.

industrial countries, because these regions were incapable of
resistance. Britain reacted to this.  That was the beginning of
imperialism.  

|| ?

“It was especially assisted by the system, which arose simultaneously with
it, of export of capital to the agrarian regions” (918)....  

Railways in the new countries—the development of trade—their
protection by the state—the striving for annexations (+ preventing the
development of industry in them)....  

“These are the most important roots of imperialism which replaced free
trade”....  
 

“Does it constitute the last possible form of capitalist world policy,
or is some other form still possible?”  

One “aspect of imperialism”, that is “a vital necessity for
capitalism”, viz.: domination over and subjugation of agricultural
regions, the construction of railways, can be overcome “only
through socialism” (920)....  

There is, however, another aspect of imperialism: the struggle
waged by states, armaments, war, the resistance of India, Islam and Eastern
Asia, the resistance of the proletariat—all this impels “the capitalists
of all countries to unite” (920)....  

||
  ultra-imperialism[3]

“From the purely economic point of view, therefore, it is not impossible
that capitalism will yet go through a new phase, that of the

ha-ha |||
extension of the policy of the cartels to foreign policy, the phase
of ultra-imperialism, against which, of course, we would have to
fight as vigorously as against imperialism, although it will bring dangers
in another direction, not in that of an armaments race and threats to world
peace” (921)....  

This was written before the war.

!! |||

Austria’s conflict with Serbia “did not arise exclusively from imperialist
tendencies” (922)—it has “just as much (ebenso) a nationalist” “as an
imperialist root” (922).

ha-ha! [DITTO: ||| ]

True, he says, there are “contradictions”, which imperialism created
“between the other Great Powers”. Armaments might be increased and peace
(after this war) will be only a truce.  

“From the purely economic point of view, nothing any longer prevents
this huge discharge of tension from

||

finally resulting in the abolition of imperialism through a holy alliance
of the imperialists” (922).... The more prolonged the war and the
exhaustion ..., the nearer we shall be to this solution....  

 


[RIGHT BOX END:]

Ibidem, p. 981—in the article on “Effects of the
War”—internationalism “does not exclude” “national feeling” and
defence of the fatherland, but requires their recognition “for each
nation”; “in this sense” (sic!) the Germans and
French voted the war credits.

]]



p. 975—ibidem—“our comrades” voted the war credits both
to defend the fatherland and “liberate Russia from tsarism” (!!)....


|| ha—ha!

p. 974—“there should be an appeal to the statesmen of the victorious
countries to exercise moderation” (thrice).  

p. 846 (August 21, 1914)—an article “The War” (dated August 8,
1914)—ends with an appeal for “trust”, but not for
“criticism”—“discipline in the Party”....  

“Two Articles for Re-study” (1915, 2) § d:
“The concept of imperialism.”  

Opposing Cunow, he asserts that (Hilferding’s) “conclusions” about
finance capital have been “unanimously [K. Kautsky’s
italics] adopted by all socialist
   theoreticians”[4]

(p. 107) (April 23, 1915).  

Cunow equates imperialism with “modern capitalism”
(109).  

Kautsky rejects this. In Britain in the 1890s (110), imperialism meant
the striving for a great Britain (110), for empire, “a special kind of
imperial policy” (110. K. Kautsky’s italics)—colonies,
protectionist policy.  

|| ?

“It [“this new policy”] was termed imperialism by everyone” (N.B.)
(ibidem).  


|||| N.B. Die Neue Zeit, 1897–98, XVIth year, Vol. I

I was the “first” (he says) to study the “new imperialism” (Die
Neue Zeit, 1897–98 (16, 1), “Old and New Colonial Policy”) and to
point to the export of capital, to the role of the financial top
stratum. Hilferding in 1910 did not call this new phase of
capitalism “imperialism” (110–11). “He [Hilferding], too,

|||| evasion, arguing over words

uses the term ‘imperialism’ to mean a special kind of policy, and
not a ‘phase of economy’.  Imperialism for him [= Hilferding] is a policy
preferred by finance capital” (111)....  
 

We must draw this distinction: imperialism is not a “phase of
economy”, but a special policy, like
Manchesterism.[7] We must distinguish between finance capital and
imperialism—“its policy” (111).  

“Imperialism is a special kind of capitalist policy, as was also
Manchesterism,

well, that’s it! ||

which it replaced. The latter, too, did not denote a definite ‘phase of
economy’, although it was necessarily connected
with such a phase”
(111).[5]



[[DOUBLE BOX ENDS:]]

[[

Imperialism is the policy of the “economic phase” of finance capital!! Is
that what you wanted? Pettyfogger and sophist,
trickster,[8] twister—that’s what you are! You evade the essence of
the matter.

]]



§ e) “the necessity of imperialism” (112 et seq.)  

“That imperialism was inevitable and

||

therefore necessary—no one will deny.... The debatable question is
whether it is necessary in the future”... (113).  

And, further, the passages quoted by me in

Manchesterism (Free Trade)—a trend of bourgeois economic
policy which advocated freedom of trade and non-interference by the state
in private economic activity. It arose in England at the end of the
eighteenth century; in the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century
the main support of Free Trade came from the industrial bourgeoisie of
Manchester; hence the Free Traders were also called Manchesterites. The
Manchester school was headed by Cobden and Bright. Free Trade tendencies in
the era prior to monopoly capitalism also struck root in Germany, France,
Russia and other capitalist countries. Free Trade was theoretically
substantiated in the works of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

p. 288





[8]

Lenin calls Kautsky a sophist and trickster for distorting the true
nature of imperialism, evading the issue and using sophistries and spurious
theoretical arguments to gloss over the deep-seated contradictions of
imperialism and justify unity with the apologists of capitalism, the avowed
social-chauvinists.

p. 268





[9]

Kommunist—a magazine founded by Lenin and published by the
editorial board of the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat jointly with
G. L. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosh, who financed its publication.
N. I. Bukharin was also a member of the editorial board. The only (double)
issue, which appeared in September 1915, contained three articles by Lenin:
“The Collapse of the Second International”, “The Voice of an Honest
French Socialist” and “Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”

(see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 205–59, 349–56, 357–66).



Lenin drew up the plan for the magazine in the spring of 1915. He
intended to make Kommunist an international organ of the Left
Social-Democrats. However, serious disagreements soon arose between the
editors of Sotsial-Demokrat and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh, and
became more acute after the first issue was published. In view of the
anti-Party attitude of this group, the Sotsial-Demokrat
   

editorial board, on Lenin’s proposal, decided that It was impossible to
continue the magazine.

V. I.  

      Lenin
NOTEBOOK “δ”
(“DELTA”)



    

   
     PANNEKOEK, “STATE EXPENDITURE AND IMPERIALISM”
   

Ant. Pannekoek, “State Expenditure and
Imperialism” (Die Neue Zeit, 1913–14, 32, 1, No. 4, October 24,
1913, p. 110 et seq.).  

(x) “In my opinion, the contradiction between principled and reformist
tactics is that the latter

? ||

is  too  strongly determined by immediate
interests, by easily attainable and apparent results, and
sacrifices to them the inner strength of the proletariat.
Principled, Marxist tactics aim primarily at increasing the power of the
proletariat, thereby securing the highest positive results; for these
results, being concessions made by the ruling classes, depend primarily on
the power of the proletariat” (p. 111).  

   And before the above passage:
   


(**) not the right word; not so ||2

“The essence of the socialist class struggle is inseparable unity of the
struggle for socialism (**) and representation of all the
immediate interests of the proletariat. Only the Party’s fight for the
current interests of the working class makes it the party of the
proletariat,

true! ||2

the party of the masses, and enables it to win victory” (x).  


[BOX:]

[[

N.B. Pannekoek’s formulation of the question of reformism is
wrong.

]]




N.B.

[DOUBLE LEFT-TOP-RIGHT BOX END:]

Pannekoek has here posed a question of prime importance, but has
answered it badly—or, at least, inaccurately. “The unity of the struggle
for socialism and for reforms” or “and for the immediate
interests of the workers”? But what is the struggle for socialism? In
Pannekoek’s formula, the distinction between the Left and the “Centre” is
blurred, wiped out, has disappeared. Even Kautsky (who,
incidentally, made no rejoinder to this article of Pannekoek’s) would
subscribe to Pannekoek’s formula (the one given here). This formula is
wrong.

    

||

The struggle for socialism lies in the unity of
the struggle for the immediate interests of the workers (including reforms)
and the revolutionary struggle for power, for
expropriation of the bourgeoisie, for the overthrow of the bourgeois
government and the bourgeoisie.  

What have to be combined are not the struggle for reforms
+ phrases about socialism, the struggle “for socialism”, but two
forms of struggle.  

For example: 

1. Voting for reforms + revolutionary action by the masses....  

2. Parliamentarism + demonstrations....  

3. The demand for reforms + the (concrete) demand for revolution....


Economic struggle together with the unorganised, with the
masses, and not only on behalf of the organised workers....  

4. Literature for the advanced + free, mass literature for the more
backward, for the unorganised, for the “lower masses”....  

5. Legal literature + illegal....  


{cf. same volume of Die Neue Zeit, p. 591, on “unskilled”
workers in America}

Article:“The End of the War.”  

“Butthe longer the war lasts, the more prone will the peoples, as
distinct from the governments, be to cry out against the carnage which is
desolating day by day and week by week so many thousands of homes. Thus we
are brought back again to the

||

problem of



State versus Man’, and to the question

N.B.  |||
how far the rulers of the highly organised bureaucratic state will be
able to hold out against internal revolutionary forces”....

     ARGUMENTS OF THE SOCIAL-PATRIOTS
   

Arguments of the Social-Patriots


UptonSinclair’s pamphlet, with Blatchford’s
reply, sets out particularly clearly, frankly, accurately and vigorously
the new (not Plekhanov’s or Kautsky’s, etc.) argument of the
social-patriots: 

Yes,the war is in the interests of the capitalists, etc., but we are
manifestly weak, manifestly powerless to prevent

    

it. Talk of struggle against war, of “insurrection”, etc., etc., is
“piano opinion”, hopeless “exaggeration” of our strength.  


[BOXENDS:]

[[

A variant of the “utopianism” argument, which was advanced also in
Plekhanov’s lecture.

]]



Fromthis point of view, the Basle resolution is a well-meaning attempt
to frighten the governments, and not a resolute pledge to carry out
revolutionary actions or revolutionary propaganda.  

[Thisformulation, which reduces everything to a “preventive war”, is
extremely narrow—and was deliberately made so by Blatchford. The
essential thing is to utilise the crisis for revolutionary
propaganda and to prepare for revolutionary action.]

Parliament. 

...“Mr.E. Jones (Merthyr Tydfil) asked if censorship could not be
applied to the writings of Mr. Keir Hardie in his journal”....  

Later,at the end of the sitting, the same speaker said:
I  told Keir Hardie I  was going to talk about him, and it is not my fault
if he is not present.  

Heread extracts from Keir Hardie’s articles of October 31
and November 7, in which Keir Hardie accuses the British and French of
atrocities, and sneers at the loyalty of the Indian troops. Keir Hardie
said that the Kaiser was brave, soldier-like, whereas he sneered at “our
fireside-loving King”.  

Canthe government tolerate such speeches from a Member of Parliament?
“As a result in Merthyr Tydfil we have had considerable difficulty in the
past few weeks in recruiting, although it had been going on handsomely
before Mr. Keir Hardie began his tactics.”  

ThenMr. J. A. Pease said: “May I just say, in one word, that
so far as the Government are concerned, they believe all the suggestions
made by Mr. K. Hardie and referred

    

to by Mr. Jones to be entirely without foundation, and that they ought to
be treated with contempt.”

Article:“The European Deadlock”....  

...“Itis not surprising that under such, conditions [the “appalling
conditions of modern warfare”] the soldiers should, in places where mud
has made progress almost impracticable, conclude impromptu truces, such as
are described by a correspondent in The Times of yesterday. These
truces naturally occur only in the parts of the field where the trenches
are close together, but they bring home to the imagination the cruel
absurdities of the war, and suggest to some

|| N.B.

a hope that from the soldiers in the field there might come a protest
against the indefinite prolongation of its horrors” (p. 46)....

TheEconomist, December 19, 1914,
p. 1059, article: “The War and Modern Business.”  

...“Untilthe bloodiest storm in history burst at the end of July, it
was hardly possible to tell where Krupp began or Creusot ended. War loans
were inextricably mingled with peace loans, and deadweight debt with full
capital issues. Whether to destroy or to construct, whether to build canals
or forts, ocean liners or battleships, the whole world of business and
finance seemed to have centred itself in London, Paris and Berlin. The
financial houses were almost of necessity Anglo-German, Anglo-French and
Anglo-American; directorships were interlaced, branches of agents existed
in nearly all the cities of the Old World and of the New. Monster companies
and corporations welcomed share holders of all nationalities, with very
little regard for the diplomatic alliances.... It was a truism six months
ago to say that nationality was no obstacle to business
arrangements.... All this came to an end all of a sudden.... And yet the
businessmen and the working classes are admittedly innocent. The guilt of
war is everywhere traced to a few men—emperors, diplomatists, statesmen,
militarists, or ‘philosophers’.... Let us hope for a swift disillusionment,
a return of common sense, a revival of religion, and a reawakening of the
human conscience”....

Ibidem(January 2, 1915), p. 12: 

“Disgustat the utter barbarism and ferocity of modern warfare is
reported by all who have seen it.  Everywhere people are beginning to ask
how long human nature itself can endure the awful anguish of this

||

indescribable war, how soon exhaustion and the approach of starvation will
drive the peoples into

||

revolt. Some of the German newspapers look for a revolution in Russia.
They may have to count with one at home, for nothing is more likely than
that the working classes of Germany will turn savagely upon the aggressive
militarism which has been their bane.”

       COAL AND IRON
   

InternationaleMonatsschrift f\"ur
Wissenschaft, Kunst und Technik (Leipzig), 1910, January (10th year,
No. 4).  Hans Arlt, Dr., mining assessor in Munich.  “Coal
and ton and Their Significance in the Present World War.”  Statistics of
coal and iron reserves in the belligerent countries.

 (Iron ore resources of the world)

 (Coal ” ” ” ” ) 
 

(Geologicalcongresses, Stockholm 1910 and Toronto 1913).




In coal resources the order is: 
In iron:


  1. United States 
1. United States


  2. Canada        
2. Newfoundland


  3. China         
3. Germany


  4. Germany       


Coal output in 1913:


Great Britain 
–287.4 million tons


Germany 
–278.9 ” ”


(Consumption: 
250.3 Germany


 
233.8 Britain)




Theimportant invention, by Thomas (1878), of the basic or Thomas
method of obtaining iron did away with the Bessemer method.  

Thenew method gave Germany a big lead, for it frees the ore
from phosphorus, and German ore is rich in phosphorus
(N.B.).  

Thatis how Germany beat Great Britain.

|| N.B.



Thechemical industry produces coal tar (1 million tons in 1912 in
Germany).  



German-occupied French areas contain


 
about 70% 
of French coal resources


” 80% 
” ” iron ”


 (Without America, France would have
    perished long ago.)

Trade Union Leaders


TheDaily Telegraph, October 7, 1915.


“Afterhearing addresses by the Prime Minister and Earl Kitchener, and
holding lengthy conferences on the subject of recruiting, the chosen
leaders of Labour have issued a strongly-worded appeal for men, in which it
is stated that ‘if the voluntary principle is to be vindicated, at least
30,000 recruits per week must be raised’.  

“Mr.C. W. Bowerman, M.P., Secretary of the Trades Union
Congress Parliamentary Committee, handed a representative of The Daily
Telegraph a copy of the appeal yesterday afternoon. It reads as
follows: 
    

    
The Crisis


An Appeal to Free Men



N.B.||

“Fellow countrymen.... At no time in the history of our nation has it been
faced with a crisis of such gravity as the one which now
exists.... Aggression [of Germany, etc... (the aim)]: secure such a victory
as will free the world from the fear of that military tyranny which Germany
would impose upon it....” An appeal to enlist in the army. For the sake of
what?... “Not only because by so doing they will be defending their own
interests, but also because their action will preserve the vital interests
of the nation”....  

“Weknow that defeat or an inconclusive peace would mean for us not
only the loss of prestige as a nation and the certainty that the conflict
would be renewed in a few years’ time, but the loss of those personal
liberties and privileges which have taken centuries of effort to win”....

WI, 

Dr. Sigmund Schilder, Development Trends in
the World Economy, Berlin, 1912—p. 150—refers to G. Paish, whose
figures, he says, are minimised, for Paish takes issue prices (for
Latin America 556 = £ 556 million, whereas London
Stock Exchange quotations on May 31, 1909 Σ = £767
million, including Argentina—£281 million,
Brazil—£140 million).— 

The London Economist, August 26, 1911, estimates British
capital in 10 South American republics (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile,
Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Paraguay) at
£ 622 million, including Argentina—316, Brazil—162,
Uruguay—42, Chile—41 (ibidem, p. 371).  

Foreign capital in Canada (1910) = 12,687 million
francs, including British—9,765, U.S.—2,190, French—372. In
Mexico (1886–1907) =3,343 million francs, including
U.S.—1,771, British—1,334 (p. 373).  

Belgian capital abroad (Berlin Export,
November 24, 1910) in million francs: Holland—70; France—137;
Brazil—143; Italy—166; Egypt—219; Germany—244; Argentina—290; the
Congo—322; Spain—337; Russia—441; other

1) “Alaska is regarded here as a colony of the U.S.A.” 




“The characteristic feature of this period is, therefore, the
partition of Africa and Polynesia”... (p. 254).  

The plunder of the natives by the European countries is especially
clearly revealed in the account of the division of Farther
India (Siam with British “Burma” or Burmania from the West, and
French Indo-China from the East)—in Supan, p. 299 et seq. The result (in
rounded area figures) (000 sq. km.):

“It should also be borne in mind that Siam is guaranteed only 239,000
sq. km.”....  

((H\"ubner (1914) shows Siam as having
600,000 sq. km.!! Not yet completely plundered!!))  

Supan states: “There should be no doubt that this process [the
division of Farther India] is not yet completed.”  
 

Summarising the results of colonisation, Supan says that it has been
carried out mainly in the last fifty years (1850–1900)—p. 306
et seq.—He distinguishes three types of colonies: 1) native (no whites or
almost none. British India belongs in this category); 2) mixed (whites in a
minority; a mixture); 3) migrational colonies (marked preponderance of
whites).  

He gives detailed figures for America (38,331,200 sq. km.; 144.2
million inhabitants, including 88.3 million whites); Africa (26,950,900
sq. km.; 123.3 million inhabitants); Asia (24,506,200 sq. km.; 390.6
million inhabitants); South Seas colonies (8,938,300 sq. km.; 6.4 million
inhabitants). Supan sums up as follows (p. 313):

(In the first group is mainly India—with 365 million—in
Asia, and 105 million in Africa.—In the third group are mainly
North America—78.7 million, and Siberia and Central Asia—7.6 million).

V. I.

    “ENGINEERING WAR”
   

The Daily Telegraph, March 15,
1915. “Engineering War.”  “Oil in Warfare. The All-Oil
Battleship.”  

“The Chancellor of the Exchequer was right when he said: ‘This is an
engineers’ war.’ We are seeing the impress

    

of the engineer on every phase of the stupendous struggle now in progress
throughout the world. No longer is engineering a side-line. It has become
the principal feature of war, so much so ‘that Eye-Witness’ has seen fit to
call the present ‘the petrol war’ in the course of his recent description
of the part played by mechanical traction on the Continent. To call it ‘the
oil war’ would probably be more accurate since this term would also include
the Fleet, so far as many of its greatest and smallest craft—as
represented by super-dreadnoughts and submarines—are concerned.”  

The Queen Elizabeth is one of the first “all-oil”
vessels. Less cost. The chief thing is the speed in fuelling, etc., etc. A
gigantic technical advance.  

The transition to “internal-combustion-engined war ships” is
imminent. Commercial ships are already making the transition.

JUNIUS, THE CRISIS OF
SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY[1]


Junius, The Crisis of Social-Democracy. Supplement:
“Theses on the Tasks of International Social-Democracy.” Zurich,
1916, 109pp. (105–09,theses).  

“Introduction” dated January 2, 1916: the pamphlet is stated
to have been written in April 1915.  

p. 6: “The capitulation of international Social-Democracy ... the most
stupid thing would be to conceal it”....  

p. 24: “Two lines of development ... lead ... to this war.” 1) 1870,
N.B., the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, and 2)
imperialist development in the last 25 years.  


|| N.B.

p. 28: B\"ulow’s speech on December 11, 1899. A clear imperialist
programme: the British have “Greater Britain”, the French their “New
France”, the Russians—Asia, the Germans “Greater Germany”.  

pp. 31–33: excellent account of the plunder of Turkish peasants in
Asia Minor by German finance capital.  

p. 42: ...“The existence of only two countries—Belgium
and Serbia—is at stake in the present war”.  

p. 43: In Russia, imperialism is “not” so much
“economic expansion” as “the political interest of the
state”.  
 

p. 48: The break-up of Austria was accelerated “by the
emergence of independent national states in the immediate neighbourhood of
the monarchy”....  

...“The internal un-viability of Austria was shown”....


...“The Hapsburg monarchy is not the political organisation of a
bourgeois state, but only the loose syndicate of cliques of social
parasites” (49)....  


||

...“An inevitable dilemma: either the Hapsburg monarchy or the capitalist
development of the Balkan countries” (49)....

||




N.B. |||

...“Historically, the liquidation of Austria-Hungary is but the
continuation of the disintegration of Turkey, but at the same time it is a
requirement of the historical process of development” (49–50).  

“German imperialism, chained to two decomposing corpses, steered
straight into the world war” (50).  

...“For ...  an alleged attempt (at high treason)... Duala Manga Bell
of the Cameroons was hanged quietly, amidst the noise of war, without the
troublesome procedure of a court trial.... The Reichstag group shrouded the
body of Chief Duala in a discreet silence” (56).  

 p. 60: two causes of the 1905 defeat: 


? |||

(1) its “huge” political programme; “some (of the problems), such as the
agrarian question, are altogether insoluble within the framework of the
present social order”....  

(2) the aid of European reaction....  


||

71: “The dangers to the ‘free development of Germany’ do not lie in
Russia, as the Reichstag group thought, but in Germany herself”... (and,
incidentally, the expression: “the Zabern policy”, p. 71).  

74: “Does not the socialist principle of the right of nations to
self-determination imply that every people is entitled and bound to defend
its freedom and independence?”...  (75) “certainly, a people that
surrenders to an external enemy is contemptible”....  

75: A quotation from The Civil War in France: “The
highest heroic effort of which old society is still capable is national
war; and this is now proved to be a mere governmental
humbug”....[2] 
 

76: “In bourgeois society, therefore, invasion and class struggle are
not opposites, as the official legend has it, but one is the means and
expression of the other. And if for the ruling classes invasion represents
a well-tried means against the class struggle, for the ascending classes
the sharpest class struggle still proves to be the best means against
invasion”.... The history of the Italian towns in the Middle
Ages, and especially 1793.  


|||

77: The same applies to self-determination: “True, socialism recognises
the right of every nation to independence and freedom, to independent
mastery of its destinies. But it is a real mockery of socialism when the
modern capitalist states are presented as the

|

expression of this right of the nations to self-determination. In which of
these states has the nation yet determined the forms and conditions of its
(sic!)

||

national, political or social existence?” By “self-determination of the
German people”, Marx, Engels, Lassalle under stood “the united, great
German republic”. [Modern Germany has been built (N.B.) (77) “on the
ruins of the German people’s right to national (N.B.) self-determination
(N.B.)”....]


77 ...“or is it, perhaps, the Third Republic with colonial possessions
in four continents, and colonial atrocities in two of them, that is an
expression of the ‘self-determination’ of the French nation?”...  

78: “In the socialist sense of this concept, there is not a single
free nation, if its existence as a state rests on the enslavement of other
peoples,

|| N.B.

for the colonial peoples, too, are reckoned as peoples and as members of
the state. International socialism recognises the right of free,
independent and equal nations, but it is only socialism that can create
such nations, and only it can realise the right of nations to
self-determination. And this socialist slogan serves like all the other
socialist slogans not to justify the existing order of things, but to
indicate the way forward, and to stimulate the proletariat in its active,
revolutionary policy of transformation”....  
 


? |||

In the imperialist situation of today there cannot be any more “national
wars of defence” (78)...  to ignore this situation means “to build on
sand”.  

Hence “the question of defence and attack, the question of who is to
‘blame’, is quite meaningless” (78); for both France and Great Britain it
is not a matter of “self-defence”, they are defending “not their
national, but their world political position”....  


[TOP-RIGHT{DOUBLE}-BOTTOM BOX ENDS:]

[[

N.B.: ...“in order to dispel the phantom of ‘national war’ which dominates
Social—Democratic policy at present” (81).

]]



Imperialist policy is an international phenomenon, the result of “the
world-wide development of capital” (79).... “It is only from this
starting-point that the question of ’national defence’ in the present war
can be correctly posed” (80).... The system of alliances, military
interests, etc., immediately involve imperialist
interests and countries.... “Finally, the very fact that today all
capitalist states have colonial possessions which in time of war, even if
it begins as a ‘national war of defence’, are in any case drawn into the
war from military-strategic considerations” ... the “holy war” in
Turkey, the instigation of uprisings in the colonies...—“this fact, too,
today automatically converts every war into an imperialist world
conflagration” (82)....  

The example of Serbia (behind which stands Russia), Holland (her
colonies and so forth).... “In this way, it is always the
historical situation created by present-day imperialism that determines the
character of the war for the different countries, and it is because of this
situation that nowadays national wars of defence are in general no longer
possible” (84)....  

He quotes K. Kautsky: Patriotism and Social-Democracy, 1907,
p. 16 in particular, that “under these conditions a war for the defence of
national freedom can no longer be expected anywhere” (Kautsky, quoted by
Junius, p. 85).  (K. Kautsky, pp. 12–14 on “national problems”, that
they can be solved “only (N.B.) after (N.B.) the
victory of the proletariat”.) [K. Kautsky, p. 23. N.B.]  
 

What then is the task of Social-Democracy? Not to be “passive”.

|||| ?

“Instead of hypocritically dressing the imperialist war in the cloak of
national defence, we should take seriously [author’s italics] the
right of nations to self-determination and national defence and use them as
a revolutionary lever against [author’s italics] the imperialist
war (85). The most elementary requirement of national defence is that the
nation should take defence into its own hands. The first step in that
direction is a militia, i.e., not merely immediate arming of the
entire adult male population, but above all the decision by the people of
the question of war and peace;

||| ??? N.B. ||

it implies also immediate abolition of all political disfranchisement,
since the people’s defence must be based on the greatest political
freedom. And it was the prime duty of Social-Democracy to proclaim these
genuine national defence measures, and strive for their realisation”
(86). But the Social-Democrats abandoned the demand for a militia until
after the war!!! although we have said that “only a militia”
is capable of defending the fatherland!!!  

“Our teachers had a different conception of defence of the
fatherland”... (Marx in The Civil War, in support of the national
war of the Commune)... and ... Frederick Engels in 1892, in
support of a repetition of 1793....

|||| N.B.  ||

But alongside this: “When Engels wrote that, he had in mind a
situation quite different from the present one” (87)—prior to the
Russian revolution. “He [Engels] had in mind a genuine national war of
defence by a suddenly attacked Germany” (87)....  


||| ??

And further: “Yes, it is the duty of the Social-Democrats to defend their
country during a great historical crisis. And precisely therein lies the
grave guilt” of the Social-Democratic Reichstag group....

||| ??

“They did leave the fatherland unprotected in the hour of its
greatest peril. For their first duty to the fatherland in that hour was to
show the fatherland what was really behind the present imperialist

    

war;

N.B. ||||

to sweep away the web of patriotic and diplomatic lies covering up this
encroachment on the fatherland; to proclaim loudly and clearly that for the
German people both victory and defeat in the present war are equally
fatal...; to proclaim the necessity of immediately arming the people and of
allowing the people to decide the question of war and peace ... finally, to
oppose the imperialist war programme, which is to preserve Austria and
Turkey, i.e., perpetuate reaction in Europe and in Germany, with the old,
truly national programme of the patriots a nd democrats of 1848, the
programme of Marx,

??? |||||

Engels and Lassalle—the slogan of a united, great German Republic. This
is the banner that should have been unfurled before the country, which
would have been a truly national banner of liberation, and which would

||||

have been in accord with the best traditions of Germany and with the
international class policy of the proletariat” (88).  


__ 100: |

...“Hence, the grave dilemma—the interests of the fatherland or the
international solidarity of the proletariat—the tragic conflict which
prompted our parliamentarians to side, ‘with a heavy heart’, with the
imperialist war, is purely imaginary, a bourgeois-nationalist fiction. On
the contrary, there is complete harmony between the interests of the
country and the class interests of the proletarian International, both in
time of war and in time of peace: both war and peace demand the most
energetic development of the class struggle, the most determined fight for
the Social-Democratic programme” (89)....  


[DITTO: | ]

But what should the Party have done? Call a mass strike? Or call for
refusal to serve in the army? It would be absurd to try to answer. The
revolution cannot be “made”. “Prescriptions and recipes of a technical
nature” would be “ridiculous” (90); it is not a question of
such things, but of a clear political slogan. (Expatiates against
technique, etc., etc., “small conspiratorial circles”, etc.)
(N.B. 101–02).  
 


|| | __

§ VIII (93-104) deals especially with the question of “victory or
defeat”, endeavours to prove that both are equally bad (ruin, new wars,
etc.). To choose between them would be “a hopeless choice between two lots
of thrashing” (98)... “except in one single case: if by its revolutionary
intervention the international proletariat upsets all the calculations”
(of both imperialisms) (98).... There can be no status quo (99), no going
“backwards”, only forward to the victory of the proletariat. Not hare
brained schemes of disarmament, not “utopias” or “partial reforms”
(99), but the struggle against imperialism.  

p. 102—the threat of “mass collapse of

||| but America??  and Japan??

the European proletariat” (102).... “When the hour strikes, the signal
for the social revolution that will set mankind free will come only from
Europe, only from the oldest capitalist countries. Only the British,
French, Belgian, German, Russian and Italian workers together can lead the
army of the exploited and enslaved in the five continents of the world”
(103).

Hochland, Munich, No. 8, 1914–15, May
1915.  


[[BOX:

A Roman Catholic, aristocratic organ of the Austro-Munich clericalists

]]



(published by Karl Muth) 

Th. Brauer, War and Socialism.  

...“The war is more than just an episode in the development of
socialism: it leads (at least as a possibility) to a definite end of this
development” (176)....  

...(The “story” of Marx, Engels, Bebel....)  

...“Theoretical ‘annihilation’ does not prevent ‘opportunism’ from
living merrily on and winning respect. As the masses flocking to the
socialist banner grow, so also, but to a much greater degree, grows their
desire with regard to the present, and there is no preventing them, in
their aspirations, from turning their eyes to the present-day state”
(179–80)....  

...Precisely in this (revolutionary) ideology, against which Bernstein
fought—“precisely in this ideology the European war plays a great part
as the prelude to the social revolution” (180).  

(The trade unions grow wiser) 
 

...“immediately before the war there was also a formal approximation
between trade union socialism and ‘bourgeois’ social reform” (181).  

“The volte-face of German Social-Democracy at the outbreak of the war,
seen in its purely external aspect, came as a sudden sharp break. Right up
to the eve of the war, the press carried exhortations,

||| N.B.

warnings and appeals in the old agitational jargon.  Views were even
expressed which, by referring to what allegedly happened in France after
1870, sounded like eulogy of defeat. Then, however, a single day brought
about ... a turn which could not be more complete. The official
explanations do not even remotely justify it. As everyone knows—and there
is no need therefore to dwell on this—they can be easily refuted by
previous official statements” (181).  

...(The socialist masses, we are told, came into contact with the

  ARTICLES AND NOTES IN LE TEMPS


Le Temps, December 6, 1915.  

“The anniversary of the battle of Champigny” was celebrated today.


Speech by M. Albert Thomas: 

“No peace until our Alsace and our Lorraine have been definitely
returned to France”....  

...until German imperialism has been rendered harmless, etc.,
etc. (...“victory”....)... “to the finish”....  

Ibidem, December 7, 1915.  

An article (editorial) “Good Words”.  

“This demonstration is the more significant because M. Albert Thomas
represents in the government, together with M.M. Guesde and Sembat, the
United Socialist Party, certain elements of which cannot

N.B. ||

forget the dangerous tendencies which used to prevail among them before the
war and remain obsessed by the vague ideal of an internationalism from
which we almost perished”....

|


...“There is here” (in the Thomas speech) “a precise, formal claim
for the simple unconditional return of Alsace-Lorraine to France. These
words are in happy contrast to the too cautious formulas sometimes advanced
by the extreme Left and open to regrettable misunderstandings.”  

Ibidem (p. 2) “Among the Socialists”. Yesterday there was a
preparatory meeting (for the Party Congress on December 25, 1915) of the
Seine federation. Bourderon tried to speak, “but he was violently
interrupted” (there were shouts that he had no credentials) (idem
Journal des débats, December 7, 1915. When Bourderon said that
he represented the minority, “violent protests were raised”...).  

“Yesterday evening in the rue de Paris at Montreuil, M. Merrheim was
to have given a lecture on the international pacifist conference in
Zimmerwald. M. Merrheim’s lecture was forbidden.”

“AMERICAN ARMS SUPPLIERS”
   

Article in Neue Z\"urcher Zeitung, 1915, No. 485, 1st morning
edition. April 23, 1915.  
 

American Arms Suppliers.  

“For some considerable time now the American press has carried reports
on arms deliveries to the Entente powers. We take the following from a
California newspaper: 

“‘Warmaterial destined for the Allies is now shipped by
American producers to Canada, from where British ships carry it to
England. Goods for France and Russia follow the same route, via
England. Through agents or directly, the Allies have contracts with nearly
all American armaments factories. Of course, the factories keep this a
secret, for fear of having to stop their supplies, because all this
material is contraband of war.  

“‘Fifty-seven U.S. factories are engaged exclusively in
armaments production. They normally employ about 20,000 workers, but now,
working two and three shifts, the number is about 50,000. They do not make
explosives. These are produced at about 103 factories, whose output has
doubled since the outbreak of the war. Many gun-cotton factories are
working three shifts. The mass demand has, of course, resulted in higher
prices. Thus, in February the French Government ordered 24,000,000 lbs

||

of gun-cotton at 65 cents per pound, whereas in ordinary times the cost is
24–25 cents.  

“thinspace‘In addition, there are items of equipment for troops and
animals: footwear, utensils, saddles, tanned leather, etc. For America, the
European war means a vast, profitable business.’”

The Daily Telegraph, April 22, 1915.


Lloyd George’s speech in the House of Commons: 

“He astounded the House by saying that in a single fortnight of last
month the British artillery fired more shells than during the whole
continuance of the Boer War.”  
 


N.B. ||

If in September the output (of artillery shells) was 20, in
March it was 388, 19 times as much.

[ARC-ARROW DOWN TO "In March,..."]



(And in September it was more than in August, and in August more than
in July!)  

Before the war, he said, it was reckoned that there would he six
divisions on the continent. There are now 36 = 720,000 men.



[SEE ABOVE.]

In March, the Defence of the Realm Act was passed “enabling [the
government] to take over

any suitable engineering firms and turn them to producing shells.  

“Munitions without end—such is the best formula for saving life and
securing a speedy end to the war”....  

Ibidem, April 23.  

“Patriotic Pledge by Employers”: 

I declare that, in giving employment after the war, I will
give preference to those who have served in the army.  

Signature

Favours the United States of America introducing national

      ARTICLES BY HUGO B\"OTTGER IN DER TAG


Der Tag, 1915, No. 93 (edition A),
April 22, 1915.  

Article: “The Free Trade Unions and the Government” by Dr. Hugo
B\"ottger, Reichstag deputy.  

The author begins with the fact that the managing director of a mining
company (in Gelsenkirchen), Kirdorf , reproached Minister
Delbr\"uck (Minister of the Interior) for maintaining “close
contact with the trade union leaders”.  
 

This was dangerous for the workers would become more restless.  

The author replies that there is no harm in this, that workers and
employers are standing side by Bide in the trenches, that “if they (= the
free trade unions = the Social-Democrats) are enlisted for joint work on
certain labour and general national questions in the Ministry of the
Interior, that is just as much a recognition of the need,

|| N.B.

as it is an obligation, for the duration of the war, to
renounce certain provisions of the Social-Democratic
programme which belong to the sphere of the International and,
in common with all other sections of the population, to do their duty and
defend the fatherland”....  

An article by the same author in No. 82 (April 9) “The
Development of Our Policy”, in which, inter alia, it is stated: 

“It is surprising that even in Social-Democratic discussions the
opinion clearly emerges, against the back ground of Marxist thinking, that
now one has to reckon with the further development of imperialism, the
development of large world powers, externally sovereign, as far as possible
independent. Some reject this, others try to include imperialism in
socialist development,

||

and, of course, there can be no doubt as to which of these two trends is
the wiser and has the greatest prospect of success”....

“THE OBJECTS OF THE WAR”,
     ARTICLE IN THE ECONOMIST


The Economist, March 27,
1915. Saturday.  

Article: “The Objects of the War” (in connection with Grey’s speech
on Monday (March 22??) in the Bechstein Hall).  

The editors are concerned for peace and rejoice that Grey did not say
anything likely “to lengthen or embitter the war”....  

The end of the article reads: 

“Statesmanship cannot contemplate a bitter end of universal mourning
and almost universal bankruptcy.

    

A time may come before long when it will be possible to consult the
dictates of humanity and at the same time to secure the objects indicated
by Sir Edward Grey [the freedom of nationalities etc.].... If such an
opportunity is lost, the war will

N.B. |||

not go on for ever. It will end in revolutionary chaos, beginning no one
can say where and ending in no one can say what.

|||

Even if the war ceased tomorrow, there is hardly a family even in this
comparatively prosperous country which will not suffer severely for years
to come from the burdens entailed by the struggle” (p. 615). (End.)

Paris.  

On July 13, 1914 (note the date!), M. Ch. Humbert, “the reporter for
the War Committee”, anxious to demonstrate France’s unpreparedness, told
the Senate that France had practically no heavy artillery, even of
10–13–21 cm. Mortars of 28 cm. would be available ... in a year’s time!!


And next day, July 14, 1914, the War Minister, Messimy, stated in the
Senate that 

at the end of 1915 (!!) France would have 

200 long 105 mm. guns, and at the end of 1917 (!!!) 200 short

   LLOYD GEORGE ON £4,000,000,000
   

Lloyd George in the House of Commons. Tuesday, May 4,
1915 (The Daily Telegraph, May 5.)  

...“What is the income of this country? The income of this country in
times of peace is £2,400,000,000.  
 


|| N.B.

“Now it is probably higher. Why? We are spending hundreds of millions of
borrowed money here. Most of it is spent in this country. Men are working
time and overtime, their wages are higher; profits in certain trades are
higher, certainly considerably higher; and the result is that the income of
this country at the present moment is probably higher than in times of
peace.

|| N.B.

Some are probably making huge profits—(hear, hear)—and others have
raised their income far beyond their ordinary standard.  

“I have no doubt that it would be perfectly just when we come to
consider, if we can have to do it, what taxes you have to raise or what
contribution you have to levy in order to enable you to get through a war
lasting two or three years—it would

|| N.B.

be perfectly legitimate to resort to those who have made exceptional
incomes out of the war (cheers).... What are the ordinary savings of this
country in times of peace? The ordinary savings are about £300–400
(millions) per annum. The income is higher, and I do not think it is too
much to say that in every country in Europe the standard of living is
considerably lower—I am not sure to what extent.  


| _|_ | N.B.

“But the savings of this country during the period of the war when the
income is higher ought to be double.”  

And another passage from the same speech: 

“We are an enormously rich country—certainly the richest in
Europe. I  am not sure that we are not the richest country in the
world,

|| £4,000,000,000

in proportion to population. We have £4,000,000,000 invested in
foreign and colonial securities of the best”!!  

...“We have got to finance the purchases of most of our
Allies”....

 K. KAUTSKY, THE NATIONAL STATE, ETC.


The National State, the Imperialist State and the Alliance of
States, by K. Kautsky, Nuremberg, 1915 (50 pfennigs) (80 pp.).


In § 1—“Some Remarks on Democracy and the National
State”—K. Kautsky finds fault with the Right-winger (Winnig) and a
Left-winger of Halle (from the Halle Volksblatt), who say that the
principle of “the right of every nation to national self-determination”
(p. 5 in the declaration of August 4) is out-of-date. Kautsky favours the
Centrist position on this issue, and chews over all the old stuff about the
link between democracy and the national state.  

In this context, he opposes “primitive democracy” and “direct
national legislation” (8); moreover he

! ||

includes in “primitive democracy” “its most active variety, the mass
strike” (8).  
 

We are not for the status quo, he says, (14) but for a
different way of breaking out of the national framework....  

“The proletariat cannot emancipate itself by some of its sections,
engaged in definite occupations or living in definite regions, benefiting
from exploitation and oppression. That signifies rather a weakening of its
position” (16)....  

[And not a word of conclusion from this!! The sophist!]  

On p. 17 a swindling distortion of the position of the Lefts. Like the
Rights, they too (he says) agree that imperialism is inevitable,
but demand that it be countered by “the immediate realisation” (17) of
socialism....  


|| petty swindler!!

“This looks very radical, but is only (!!!) capable of driving
everyone who does not believe in the immediate practical implementation of
socialism into the camp of imperialism.”  

This is followed by the most banal prattle about society being an
organism and not a mechanism, and similar childish nonsense (with hints
about the strong “national sentiments” (18) among the workers) and the
conclusion that the inevitability of imperialism

|||

does not imply that it is foolish to fight it “within this [capitalist]
mode of production” (21).

||| N.B.



“The petty bourgeois and small peasants, and even many capitalists and
intellectuals”, are against imperialism and favour other means of
the extension of capital (apart from colonies) (21)....

V. I.

NOTEBOOK “η”

  LENSCH,
    GERMAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR


Dr. Paul Lensch, German Social-Democracy and the World
War, Berlin, 1915 (Vorw\"arts). 64 pp. (1.00 Mk).  

A model of grovelling, chauvinist blather. A comparison with Plekhanov
would be most useful!!  

The war = a “product of imperialist policy” (5). In Jena (1911) Bebel
said that instead of disarmament

|| N.B.

we had rearmament and things were moving towards “a great catastrophe”
(5)....  
 

Pointing to the early twentieth-century wars and revolutions, Lensch
exclaims: “what we are experiencing is a revolution” (6)....  

We German Social-Democrats, “the strongest group in the
International” (6), have been the most resolute in combating our
government, etc., etc., have always held up Britain as an example (as if
Britain were ruled not by a “capitalist clique”, but by a “committee for
carrying out the Ten Commandments and other laws of morality” (6-7)). He
points to the old traditions of German history and of Liebknecht, who
“never entirely got rid of a certain South-German particularism and hatred
of Prussia” (7).  

Things went so far that Kautsky maintained mastery of the seas was
“indispensable” for Britain (7: where is the quotation from?) (from the
standpoint of food supplies, in contrast to Germany)....  

! ||

“The danger of this line of reasoning, which, Incidentally, corresponded
to a view almost universally held in the Party, has become fully evident in
the present world war” (7)....  

...“this weak criticism in regard to other countries” (8) had its
roots “in the enormous strength of the Party”... “in its
internationalism”.  

“Undoubtedly, it [this world war] is an imperialist war” (9).... The
policy in the East ... the Baghdad railway ...  Britain and Egypt, etc.,
the (projected) partition of Turkey, Morocco, etc.  

“Germany was not consulted at all in this dividing

!! ||

up of the world” (10), “and it was more to protest against this insulting
disregard than to protect the not very considerable material interests of
German trade in Morocco” that the German Government protested against the
Anglo-French agreement over Morocco.  

In 1908 (the Revel meeting), the powers were already about to partition
Turkey (Russia + Great Britain + France), but were prevented by the
revolution in Turkey (11).  

In 1914, agreements were nearly completed between Great Britain and
Germany for the division of spheres in Africa (13) and in the East,
etc.—Russia is to blame for the war.  
 

In 1913 Germany threatened war over Armenia (14)....  


| !!

“For Germany, by which we mean the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, the
question of capitalist expansion has become a question of national
existence” (15).  

The question now is not merely of dividing up colonies and spheres of
influence, etc., but: “Shall the German people continue to exist as a
great and independent nation,

|| !!

or shall a large part of its national territory, in the east as well as in
the west, be torn away and forcibly subjected to foreign, rule?” (15).



|

“On which side are the interests of international socialism in general,
and of the German labour movement in particular, in this struggle, insofar
as it concerns the threat to British world domination?” (16).  

British mastery of the seas is a continuation of the wars against the
French revolution. The monopoly of Britain towards the middle of the
nineteenth century: Britain must be the “workshop” of the world.  

“The much-vaunted British ‘freedom’ was based on enslavement of the
world” (20).  

“Great Britain has in a certain sense been the ruling class of the
world” (20)....  

In Chemnitz in 1912 (p. 417 et seq. of the minutes) I, Lensch, quoted
Engels on the decline of Britain’s monopoly and said: 


| !

“International socialism, however, has not the slightest reason for
helping to perpetuate this lasting supremacy of one capitalist state over
all others. That would only make the conditions for the victory of
socialism more difficult and protracted” (22–23).  

...“the great historical advance that the shattering of British
maritime supremacy would mean for the whole world and especially for
international socialism” (23–24) would be the more certain the longer
there was peace.... The working-class movement was a threat to the British
bourgeoisie....  

...“Seen in that light, participation in the world war was for the
British bourgeoisie nothing but a flight from socialism” (24)....  
 

...“In fact, if there were a means for throwing back for decades the
proletariat’s international liberation struggle against capitalism, it
would be the collapse of Germany in this war against Britain” (25)....


“The hard core of the International”, the German Social-Democrats,
would be shattered and the working class thrown back into the camp of
capitalism, etc. (25)....  

“Germany is the centre and homeland of scientific socialism”
(26).... “The interests of the international proletariat are on the German
side” (27)....  

Russian tsarism.... Marx and En gels in 1848. But now it
is different. Engels in 1891 (quotation, p. 29). But now it is
different.  

Germany, as a complete national entity, “is being born”
“only now” “with this war” (31)....  

The German-Russian war “has grown far beyond the bounds of an
imperialist war.

||

It represents the culmination of the German people’s painful process of
development towards national unity” (33)....  

A quotation from Engels on Russian diplomacy (35): as if
written now....  

Against the dismemberment of Russia (37) (“not dismemberment” (38)),
against the formation of small states—“a certain national autonomy” is
sufficient....  

The downfall of tsarism (it should be awaited from the Russian
proletariat) will accelerate development....  

France and the war (§ V).... Revenge.  

“The interests of freedom and democracy are absolutely incompatible
with the victory of French arms” (42), for France is allied with Great
Britain and Russia.  

German Social-Democracy would “now” regard the severance of
Alsace-Lorraine “as a mutilation of Germany” (43).  

“An honourable peace” (44) with the French republic—that’s what’s
needed.  

The German past and future (§ VI): 

National culture and its significance (according to O. Bauer, quotation
p. 53). “Community of culture” (50 and others).  

Capitalism must develop “towards democracy” (55)....  

“The danger of war” (56)—the cause of delay in German
democratic progress.  
 

“Militarism” (58) in Germany?? On the contrary, universal
conscription the most and “almost the sole democratic institution”
(Engels), whereas you have “hired troops” (59)....  

“A middle-European alliance of states” (that, he says, is what Liszt
wants)—(+ the Scandinavian countries + Switzerland + Italy + the Balkans

     ARTICLE BY O. B. “EUROPEAN ALLIANCE OF STATES?”
   

Die Grenzboten, 1915, No. 9 (March 3,
1915).  

The article “European Alliance of States?” is an open letter of a
certain 0. B. to Professor G. Heymans of Groningen.  

This professor, with four other persons, form a committee calling
itself “the European alliance of states”. This committee has published
Heymans’s appeal: “To the Citizens of the Belligerent States”, to which
the open letter in Die Grenzboten is a reply.  

The open letter, inter alia, raises the question of
colonies (p. 270). “Is their ‘internal independence’ not also
desirable? And are not the Indians, Negroes and Tatars also fully ‘equal’
with Britons, Frenchmen and Russians?”... (270).  


|| quotation from the committee’s appeal

...“The British colonial empire, which is not founded ‘on the equality and
internal independence’ of the colonial peoples any more than the other
colonial empires, occupies about one-fifth of the globe.

|

Ought Great Britain to retain this colonial empire until, perhaps, the
British have died out in Britain herself, and will Germany not be allowed
to

    

malicious! |

obtain a single square metre of this empire, even if in the meantime her
population has increased to 200 million?” (271)....

Notes
 

[1]

See present edition, Vol. 22. p. 233.—Ed.

 



[2]

In the Notebooks and in Imperialism, Lenin repeatedly
refers to Hilferding’s book Finance Capital. While drawing on its
factual data in discussing particular aspects of monopoly capitalism, Lenin
criticises the author for his non-Marxist propositions and conclusions on
cardinal problems of imperialism. Lenin describes Hilferding—a prominent
German Social-Democrat and Second International leader—as a Kantian and
Kautskyite, a reformist and “persuader of the imperialist bourgeoisie”

(see p. 613 of this volume).

By divorcing politics from economics, Hilferding gives an incorrect
definition of imperialism and finance capital; he glosses over the decisive
role of the monopolies under imperialism and the sharpening of its
contradictions; he ignores such important features of imperialism as the
division of the world and the struggle for its re-division, and the
parasitism and decay of capitalism, thus taking “a step backward compared
with the frankly pacifist and reformist Englishman, Hobson”

(see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 193).

In spite of its serious errors, however, Hilferding’s book played a
positive part in the study of the latest phase of capitalism.

p. 333





[3]

Kantianism—the system of views of the eighteenth-century
philosopher Immanuel Kant, elaborated in his works The Critique of Pure
Reason (1781), The Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and
The Critique of Judgement (1790). “The principal feature of
Kant’s philosophy,” Lenin pointed out, “is the reconciliation of
materialism with idealism, a compromise between the two, the combination
within one system of heterogeneous and contrary philosophical trends”

(see present edition, Vol. 14, p. 198).

Kant tried to “reconcile” faith and knowledge, religion and
science. Kantianism has been the philosophy of all manner of opportunists,
including the Kautskyites. Marx and Engels revealed the essential nature of
Kantianism; Lenin subjected it to thoroughgoing criticism in his
Materialism and Empirio-Criticism

(see present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 17–361).



Neo-Kantianism—a reactionary trend in bourgeois philosophy
advocating subjective idealism as a revival of Kantian philosophy. It arose
in the middle of the nineteenth century in Germany. The Neo-Kantians
rejected dialectical and historical materialism. In his book, Ludwig
Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy,

   

Engels described the Neo-Kantians as “theoretical reactionaries” and
“cobweb-spinning eclectic flea-crackers”. The Neo-Kantians advanced
“ethical socialism” in opposition to scientific socialism. Their theory
was seized upon by Eduard Bernstein and other revisionists.  

Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of Neo-Kantianism and its
connection with other trends of bourgeois philosophy (Machism, pragmatism,
etc.),

p. 334





[4]

Lenin points out the falsity of Hilferding’s assertion about
Tugan-Baranovsky’s “merit” in explaining the significance of Marx’s
theory of capitalist reproduction and crises. A bourgeois economist and
prominent representative of “legal Marxism” in the nineties,
Tugan-Baranovsky distorted and sought to refute Marx’s theory. He denied
the basic contradiction of capitalism and the resulting contradiction
between the urge for continual expansion of production and restricted
consumption owing to the proletarian state of the masses, and maintained
that unlimited accumulation and unhindered expansion regardless of the
consumption and living standards of the masses was possible. Now, too,
bourgeois economists disseminate similar apologetic theories. Capitalist
reality refutes these vulgarised doctrines and completely confirms the
correctness of the Marxist theory of capitalist accumulation and crises.

    THE ELECTRIC TRUST
   

The electrical industry trust: 

“The Path of the Electric Trust” by Kurt Heinig
(Berlin). (Die Neue Zeit, 1912) (June 28, 1912), 30th year,
Vol. 2, p. 474.)  

An excellent illustration of
     imperialism[1]

:



In 1907, an agreement was concluded between
the A.E.G. (Allgemeine Elektrizit\"ats-Gesellschaft) and the
G.E.C. (General Electric Company)




A.E.G. Concern


G.E.C. Trust



on division of the world.  
 

G.E.C.—U.S.A. and Canada.  

A.E.G.—Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Holland, Denmark,
Switzerland, Turkey, the Balkans.

Special (secret) agreements on “subsidiary companies”.  “In
addition, mutual exchange of inventions and experiments!” (p. 475).

N.B. ||



The number of companies (mostly joint-stock companies) in which
the A.E.G. “has a controlling interest” is 175–200
(p. 484). Of these, the six chief companies have a capital of about
750 million marks, while the total capital of all of these
companies is probably about 1,1500 million
marks.[2]


The number of “manufacturing companies” is 16 


[[TRIPLE-BOTTOM-LEFT-TOP BOX ENDS:

signals—motor cars—typewriters—aircraft, etc.

Production of raw material, etc., by the same enterprise is characteristic
of modern industry.

“I estimate the number of bank officials in the six big
Berlin banks at 18,000 at the end of 1910” (p. 625, fourth
edition).  
 

Riesser’s book ends with a polemic against the socialists, upholds the
official view and preaches harmony (in general, Riesser is
like that): 


{{ ha-ha!! }}

Even the predicted socialisation “has not materialised” (p. 585).  


p. 582 (p. 629, fourth edition): 

“Banks and the Stock Exchange” (Riesser’s italics): 

“As regards the effect of the process of concentration on the
functions and structure of the Stock Exchange, it is a fact that,
with the influx of commissions to the big banks the latter to a certain
extent take over the functions of the Stock exchange by
counter-balancing purchase and sale commissions, handing over to
the Stock Exchange only commissions that do not counter-balance
one another. This applies equally to trade in securities, i.e., to the
capital market, and discounting operations, i.e., to the money
market.  

“As a result, the Stock Exchange, already greatly
disorganised by the Stock-Exchange laws, is increasingly deprived of the
materials indispensable for correctly fixing current prices. It is thus
further weakened, and this can have very dangerous consequences,
especially at critical times, as bad examples have proved
(note: in the recent period one can point to the day of the
outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war).  

“It follows also that the Stock Exchange is steadily losing the
feature which is absolutely essential for national economy as a whole and
for the circulation of securities in particular—that of being not only a
most exact measuring-rod, but also an ‘almost automatic
regulator of the economic movements which converge on
   it’”[3]

(Note. Quotations from Riesser: The Need for Revision of
the Stock-Exchange Law, Berlin,

    

1901), and that it is proving less and less able,

N.B. ||

to express, and control, “through price fluctuations, general public
opinion on the credit-worthiness and administration of the majority of
states, municipalities, joint-stock companies and corporations.  

||

“In this way, Stock-Exchange establishment and quotation of current
prices, which previously gave, as far as this is attainable, a
faithful picture of ‘economic processes nowhere else summed so reliably,
and nowhere else so recognisable in their totality’, consequently, a
picture of supply and demand, must now lose both in
accuracy and in stability and reliability, which is extremely regrettable
in the public interest.  

“In addition, it is to be feared that this tendency,

||

which increasingly leads to exclusion of intermediaries (brokers,
etc.), may produce an ever sharper contradiction between the banks and
the Stock Exchange, and this may be very serious. This contradiction,
moreover, would be expressed not only in a certain tension, already
noticeable between the banks and other circles interested in the Stock
Exchange, but also in the latter’s most fundamental field of activity,
namely, the establishment of current prices.  

||

“Actually, today even among experts the concepts bank and Stock Exchange,
which some consider, quite wrongly, to be completely equivalent,
[note: that is the view of Eschenbach in the
Transactions of the Union for Social Politics of September 16,
1903:

||

Schriften des Vereins f\"ur Sozialpolitik, Vol. CXIII] are in many
cases termed direct opposites, which is also quite wrong”
(note: cf. Ernst Loeb in the Nationalzeitung of April 18,
1904, No. 244) (p. 583) (p. 630, fourth edition).

Deutsche Bank, Discontogesellschaft, Dresdner Bank and Schaaffhausenscher
Bankverein,—and then the three following banks: Berliner
Handelsgesellschaft, Commerz- und Disconto-Bank, National Bank f\"ur

Here are these “groups” [common-interest associations] of the (five)
banks and their “capital strength” (p. 484 et seq.).

In Great Britain in 1899 there were 12 banks with 100 or
more branches; altogether there were 2,304 branches
(“Niederlassung”).  

In 1901 there were 21 banks with 100 or more branches;
altogether there were 6,672 branches (p. 521) (p. 558).  

||| N.B.

“At the beginning of 1905, a single bank, the London City and Midland
Bank, had 447 branches, i.e., 257 more than the big
Berlin banks and 52 provincial banks affiliated with them at
the end of 1904; on December 31, 1907 (#), according to The Economist, the British
Joint-stock banks, then numbering only 74 (exclusive of colonial and
foreign banks), of which 35 had the right to issue banknotes, had not less
than 6,809 branches and sub-branches” (522).  


Riesser continued
   

(#) Fourth edition (p. 558): “On December 31,
1908, deposit banks in Great Britain and Ireland, numbering then 63, had
not less than 6,801 branches and sub-branches. Towards the end
of 1910 the number of branches was 7,151. At this time,
four banks in England and Wales had more than 400
branches each, viz.: 



London City and Midland Bank . .   
689
(315 in 1900)


Lloyds Bank . . . . . . . . . .

Barclay & Co . . . . . . . . . .

(185 ” ” )




“Four other banks had more than 200 branches each and eleven (20,
including Scottish and Irish) had more than 100
each”[8]

(p. 559).  

 

In France, the number of agencies and branches (p. 522)
(p. 559) was:

As regards colonial banks (nearly all founded by
the Berlin big banks), Riesser’s summary is as follows (additions for 1910
from the fourth edition,
 p. 375[9]

:




N.B. ||

“At the end of the nineties there were only four German
overseas banks; in 1903 there were six with 32 branches, and at the
beginning of 1906 there were already 13, with not
less than 100,000,000 marks and more than 70 branches.  

“This, however, is relatively insignificant in comparison with the
successes of other countries in this field: already in 1904, Great
Britain, for example, had 32 (1910: 36) colonial banks
with headquarters in London and 2,104 (1910: 3,358) with
headquarters in the colonies, and also 18
(1907: 30) (1910: 36) other British banks abroad with
175 (2,091) branches. Already in 1904–05, France
had 18 colonial and foreign banks with 104 branches;
Holland had 16 overseas banks with 68 branches”
(p. 346).

total income from bank and other
operations amounted during that year to £18 million (i.e.,
about 432 million kronen)” (p. 399) (p. 431).... “‘Allegedly’

 Riesser, p. 354 (p. 384):
   

“The progress of the preceding period (1848–70),

 || N.B. 

which had not been exactly slow, compares with the rapidity with which the
whole of Germany’s national economy, and with it German banking, progressed
during this period (1870–1905) in about the same way as the speed of the
mail coach in the good old days compares with the speed of the present-day
automobile... which is whizzing past so fast that it endangers not only
innocent pedestrians in its path, but also the occupants of the
      car”....[14]


And alongside the above, in the very next sentence, Riesser,
this bourgeois vulgarian (essentially an out-and-out philistine) and lackey
of the money-bags, sees the guarantee of “public security” and “real
progress” in the “greatest virtue” of the leader:
moderation!!!  

And on the next page (355—p. 385) he admits that banks are
... “enterprises which, by their very functions and development, ‘are
not of a purely private-business character’, 1 ) but are more and more outgrowing
the sphere of purely private-business
    regulation”.[15]



 1 ) From
Riesser’s speech as president of the first all-German bankers’ congress in
Frankfurt-am-Main, September 19–20, 1902.  


But this admission does not prevent this bourgeois idiot from writing:


“The other consequence, too, predicted by the socialists, of the
process of concentration, that it is bound to lead finally to the
socialisation of the means of production, which the socialists

 ||| !!ha ha!!  “refuta-tion....”  

aim at and which is to be realised in the ‘state hail of the future’, has
not come true in Germany, and is hardly likely to come true later
on”[16]

(p. 585) (p. 633).  
 

(The Deutsche Bank alone has a turnover of 94,500
million marks (p. 361) (112,100 million in 1910, p. 391), has
connections with a group of 12 banks, controls a capital of 1,000
million marks—the capital of this group and “affiliated”
banks—has swallowed up 52 banks, has 116 branches, bank offices,
etc., in Germany—has seats on the Supervisory Boards of 120
trading and industrial companies, etc. And this is not
“socialisation”!!)  



Deutsche Bank:


Own capital 
= 
 200 million marks + 100 million reserves

= 
 94,500 million marks 


gross profit 
= 
 55 million marks 
 (1908) (p. 352) 


 
= 
 62.9 ” ” 
 (1910) (p. 382). 




The number of bank employees in the Deutsche Bank was
4,860 (1908)—p. 578 ((in 1895, there were 7,802
employees in 66 banks with 50 or more employees, ibidem)).



In discussing merchant shipping and its development in Germany on
p. 114 et seq., Riesser notes the following: 

H.-A.P.A.-G. (Hamburg-America), capital (1908) 125 million marks (+ 76
million in bonds), 162 ships (value 185.9 million marks).  

North German Lloyd, capital (1908) 125 million marks (+ 76 million in
bonds), 127 ships (value 189.1 million marks). 125 + 76 = 201.  

 || 

“In 1902–03, both these companies concluded essentially
identical agreements with the International Mercantile Marine Co.,
founded by American bankers and shipowners on January 1, 1903, with a
capital of 120 million dollars (= 480 million marks), and embracing nine
American and British lines” (p. 115). This is the so-called Morgan
trust.  

 [[DITTO: || ]] 

Content of the agreement: division of profits and division of the
world (German companies would not compete in Anglo-American freight
traffic; agreement stipulated which ports were to be used by each, etc.,
etc.). A joint control committee was set up. The agreement was for
twenty years (terminable after a year’s notice).  
 

 || 

It was to be annulled in the event of war (p. 116, end) (p. 125,
    4th edition).[17]

And this is not “socialisation”!!  


“As regards the Reichsbank, according to the information
given by the Bank Enquiry Commission (p. 179), on September 1, 1906, the
number of German firms and individuals generally solvent in their

(D\"usseldorfer) Stahlwerkverband founded March 30, 1904 (for three
years and prolonged on April 30, 1907 for a further five years). Its output
in 1904 was 7.9 million tons (p. 141) (p. 153).

On November 28, 1904, it concluded an agreement on export of

“In February 1909 there was formed also the Internationaler
Zinkh\"uttenverband (p. 159) at first until December 31, 1910, and
afterwards prolonged, evidently for three years. There are three groups
(according to the geographical location of the factories). Group A—all
German and some Belgian plants, group B—ten Belgian, French and Spanish
plants, and group C—British plants. Out of the total European output,
about 513,000 tons in 1908, Germany’s share at that time was
put at 226.9, Belgium’s—165, France’s and Spain’s together—55.8,

Great Britain’s—54.5. Member plants accounted for about 92 per cent of
the total European output.  

“Under recent arrangements member companies

can increase production at will, irrespective of fixed production quotas,
with the proviso, however, that if stocks at a definite date (March 31,
1911, is the initial date) are 50,000 tons or more, then, under definite
conditions, output must be cut by a certain percentage, in accordance with
the company’s production quota” (p. 160, 4th edition).

Bills of exchange turnover in Germany (computed from the
tax on bills) increased from 12,000 million marks in 1885 to
25,500 million marks in 1905, and to 31,500
million in 1907 (p. 228)—and to 33,400 million in
1910 (p. 246).

In the fourth edition, Riesser has this on foreign
investments (capital invested abroad) (p. 426 et seq.): 

Germany (1905), at least 24–25 thousand
million marks (this now “undoubtedly” “greatly exceeded”,
p. 436, end), including 16 thousand million marks in foreign
securities....  

“Of the total securities owned by France, estimated by Edmond
Théry (Economic Progress in France... p. 307) at
the end of 1906 at 100 thousand million francs, and
Neymarck in 1906 at 97–100 thousand million francs (with
a yield of 4 1/2 thousand million francs), at the end of 1908,
according to Théry, about 38 1/2 thousand million wore
in foreign securities.  

“The estimates vary widely, of course, but an annual increment of
at least 1,000 million francs is generally accepted. Henri
Germain, former director of the Crédit Lyonnais, estimated
this annual increase (in the years immediately preceding 1905) at
1,500 million francs; Paul Leroy-Beaulieu recently even put it
at 2,500 million francs.  

“The well-known British financial policy expert, Sir Edgar
Speyer, in a lecture at the Institute of Bankers (‘Some Aspects of
National Finance’) on June 7, 1900, estimated total British
investments abroad at £2,500 million, i.e., about
50,000 million marks, with an annual yield of £110
million (&X); his estimate for the end of

    

1910, in a lecture in the Liberal Colonial Club, is £3,500
million, or about 70,000 million marks.  

“This corresponds approximately to George Paish’s estimate
for 1907–08, about £2,700 million, i.e., about 54,000 million marks,
nearly equally divided between India and the colonies (£1,312
million), and other foreign countries (£1,381 million). The same
author gives the figure of £3,192 million, or about 64,000
million marks, for the end of 1910, and in a lecture to the Royal
Statistical Society he estimates the 1911 income from British investments
abroad, on the basis of the yearly Reports of the Commissioners of Inland
Revenue, at approximately £180 million which, however, Sir Felix
Schuster in a discussion on Speyer’s lecture of May 27,
1911, regards as too high” (p. 427).  


(&X) “Incidentally, in this lecture he validly

 N.B. || 

emphasised that intensified export, increased issues of foreign securities
and a big economic boom are only different manifestations of the same
phenomenon.

 || 

One section of the second lecture is headed: Export of British Capital,
Chief Cause of the Empire’s Prosperity” (p. 428).

metallurgical cycle, plus coal and iron mines, general engineering and
munition plants, transport and trading enterprises. In 1926, the Thyssen
family played a leading part in the formation of the Steel Trust—the
largest German war-industry combine and one of the most powerful German
monopolies. The Thyssen concern helped bring the nazis to power; it was
closely connected with a number of industrial and banking monopolies in
nazi Germany and with international monopoly capital. After the Second
World War the Steel Trust was split into two large concerns—Thyssen and
Rheinstahl. The Thyssen concern holds a leading place in the West German
iron and steel industry.  

Hugo Stinnes started a steel mill in 1893; after the First
World War it grew into a large monopoly concern with more than 1,500
enterprises in different industries. The concern went bankrupt shortly
after Stinnes’s death in 1924, but with the help of American banks his
heirs managed to keep the concern in business. One of its off shoots, the
Rhein-Elbe Union steel combine, became one of the main components of the
Steel Trust. Control of the Stinnes concern passed to the Hugo Stinnes
Corporation, a U.S. company in which the shares are held by Stinnes’s heirs
and American bankers who heavily invested in the concern.

    LIEFMANN, HOLDING AND FINANCING COMPANIES


Professor Dr. Robert Liefmann, Holding and
Financing Companies, Jena, 1909 (A Study of Modern
Capitalism and Securities) (x + 495).  

[cf. especially p. 11 of the extracts] 

((The author is a double-dyed idiot, who makes a great fuss about
definitions—very stupid ones—all revolving around the word
“substitution”. His factual data, however, mostly quite raw, are
valuable. Opponent of the labour theory of value, etc., etc.))  
 


[[TRIPLE-LEFT-BOX-END:

pp. 104–449: “Descriptive part.” The theoretical part == nonsense

]]



p. 9: Against Sombart for following “wholly in the wake” of the
Ricardo-Marx labour theory of value.  


number of shareholders || 

p. 33: “In Prussia, the number of share-holders is only 2
per cent of the population.” There are more in Britain and
America. “According to the estimate for Prussia in the 1909 Bill for
taxation of joint-stock companies, the average shareholding in Prussia is
not even 10,000 marks. These holdings are distributed among approximately
700,000 persons. All such estimates, however, are very
unreliable” (34).  

“There are no general statistical data at the present time on
the spread of stock capital.... Philippovich (Outline,
7th edition, p. 164) estimates that 40 per cent of the British national
wealth is in ‘securities’ (i.e., stocks and, mortgages). Schmoller
(statistical supplements to the Minutes of the Stock-Exchange Enquiry
Commission, 1892–93) estimated in 1892 that about one-quarter of total
Prussian capital, nearly 16,000–20,000 million marks, was invested in
securities. Sombart (The German National Economy in the
Nineteenth Century, p. 224) puts the stock capital of Germany in 1900
at 31,000–32,000 million marks” (37). “Today this figure is definitely
too low; German stock capital should be put at 45,000–50,000 million
marks, which nevertheless is only about one-fifth of the country’s national
wealth, estimated at 250,000 million marks” (37).  

In America (&X) the national wealth in 1904 was 107,000 million
dollars. About one-third was stock capital. “For Great Britain he (&X)
gives the stock capital as 26,000 million dollars, for France—19,500
million dollars. The figure for the whole of Europe is about 75,000 million
dollars” (38).

“Share capital was issued to the amount of nearly 40 million marks in 1872
and the market price rose to 170 per cent after it had paid a 12 per cent
dividend for a year.  After that, however, no dividends were paid until
1880,

 (12%–0%) 

and already in 1875 the first of the reconstructions had to be undertaken,
which since then were repeated in almost every period of unfavourable
market conditions....

 |||| N.B.  

And every time the chief sufferers were the original
   shareholders.”[2]


“Even companies founded with other aims than these
(‘speculation in stocks’) in fact

 ||| N.B.  

often go over more or less exclusively to speculation in stocks.
This may happen partly because the shareholders do not pay enough attention
to the activity of their directors,

and partly because in this respect they are deceived by the latter” (67).

predominate: 

In America—control over other companies.

” France—capital investment companies.

1,000 per cent.... On May 9, 1901, there was a crisis on the Stock
Exchange, ruining a large number of smallholders, while the chief
participants, according to Harriman’s testimony, suffered no losses through
this manipulation” (184).  
 

“With the further development of stock capitalism,

 (my italics) N.B. ||| 

the methods of fleecing the public of large sums of
money and diverting it into one’s own pockets have become more
subtle. Today the method

 Liefmann’s italics | 

is to form, and graft on one another new companies, to which one
and the same material assets are sold or leased; these assets pass from one
company to another” (180).  

The Standard Oil Company was founded in 1900.  

“It has an authorised capital of $150,000,000.

 N.B. || N.B. 

It issued $100,000,000 common and $106,000,000 preferred stock. From 1900

48, 48, 45, 44, 36, 40, 40, 40 per cent in the respective years, i.e., in

$889,000,000, $606,000,000 were distributed in dividends and the rest went
to reserve

(212).

“In 1907 the various works of the United States Steel Corporation employed
no less than 210,180 people (1908—165,211).... The largest
enterprise in the German mining industry, Gelsenkirchener
Bergwerksgesellschaft, in 1908, had a staff of 46,048 workers and

company paid a 500 per cent dividend in each of the years 1905–06
and 1906–07” (236).  
 

“In fact, experience shows that it is sufficient to own about 40
per cent of the voting shares of a company in order in normal times to
direct its
      affairs”[5]

(258). Further, there are also (especially in America) “non-voting
shares” (259), bonds, etc., and if these are shares of a company
controlling a number of

 || 

other companies, then “he [the capitalist], with his own capital of five
million dollars can control a capital 40–50 times as great” (259).

...“The Swiss Credit Institute administers it [the Zurich Electrical

eighties and early nineties prompted British capital, and also, especially,
French, as well as German, Belgian and Dutch, to acquire shares in the
mines.... Share prices

decline in mining securities was further increased by the Transvaal
war”... (414).

“The more developed an economic system is,

the more it resorts to risky enterprises, or enterprises in other
countries, to those which need a great deal of time to develop, or finally,
to those which are only of local
     importance.[6]
 N.B. || 

Hence, special financing companies have been established in these fields,
for enterprises requiring a long time for development, for example, railway
and mining enterprises”... (etc.) (434).  

 [[DITTO: || ]] 

[The more developed, the more risky... N.B.]  

 N.B. || 

Schulze-Gaevernitz repeats this almost word-for-word in an
article “Banking”, p. 21.
(Book III. Principles of Social Economics, Section V, Part II.)


“Especially if, as in the case of American controlling companies, real
activity is centred in the subordinate companies, the parent company being
no more than the owner of their stock,

 N.B. ||| 

and the share holders learn nothing of the activities of the subordinate
companies, then it is clear that all legal regulations to assure maximum
public control over the company’s enterprises can be made unworkable. That
danger can arise in all companies based on the substitution of stock,
indeed in all cases

 N.B. ||| 

when one company has considerable holdings in another” (439).  

“At the end of 1904, 3.8 per cent of all limited liability companies
had a capital of over one million marks, 9.1 per cent had a capital of over
500,000 marks each. The 3.8 per cent, however, represented 45.2 per cent of
the total capital of all limited liability companies, and the 9.1 per cent
accounted for 60.5 per cent of this capital” (459).  

(In Germany? Apparently.)  
 

460: Author’s proposal: to oblige companies to “declare” in their
accounts amounts of securities which are >1/20 “of the paid-up share
capital”.  

 ((Idiotic red-tape-ism!))
   


N.B. ||| 

“In all probability mankind will see further important technical
revolutions in the near future which will also affect the organisation of
the economic system”....  Electricity and aviation.... “As a general
rule, in such periods of radical economic change,

 ||| N.B. 
speculation develops on a large
     scale”,[7]

and judging by previous experience a considerable role will doubtlessly be
played by the principle of stock substitution and by the holding and
financing companies for carrying out necessary large-scale capital
transactions” (465–66)....  

But, he says ... joint-stock capitalism has passed its “period of
youth”. The public has become wiser.... And with big technical inventions,
“Gr\"undungsschwindel” (flotation of bubble companies) “hardly”,
etc.... (466–67)... ((“Harmonist”)) 

...“the essence of trade is in general the substitution of
demand”... (475).  

       ((Ha-ha! “Theoretician”!))
   

...“commerce is an occupation having for its object the collection,
storage and supply of goods” (476). ((In bold-face italics.
      Idiot!))[8]

DIE NEUE ZEIT, 1911 (ON WAR N.B.) AND 1912
(INTER ALIA, ON A UNITED STATES OF EUROPE)
   

Die Neue Zeit, 30th year (1912) 

[N.B. Also an article on the history of private fortunes
in America.]  

30th year, 1 (October 1911–1912) 

articles by Varga (p. 660), Hilferding (p. 773) and Kautsky (p. 837 et
seq.) on gold, commodities, money.  

|| 
Otto Bauer on the same subject in 2nd volume, 30th
year. 

N.B. also, p. 1, “Bandit Politics” (October 6, 1911)—an article by
Kautsky on the war in Tripoli, ending with the words:

 !! ||| 

“It (our electoral struggle) can overnight turn into a struggle for
power” (p. 5).

 ||




30th year, 2 (1912) 

an article by Pannekoek (“Mass Action and Revolution”)
(p. 541 et seq.)  and one by Kautsky, “New Tactics”
(August 2, 1912 et seq.) with vile passages about ministries,
etc. (a vile opportunist article).  [N.B. prior to Basle.]  Radek,
“Concerning Our Struggle Against Imperialism” (p. 233).  


[Also a polemic between Lensch and Kautsky on disarmament.
N.B. 

[Also articles by Eckstein against Pannekoek 

[Pannekoek’s article: “The Nature of Our Present-Day Demands”,
p. 810.  

Deals specially with the “feasibility” of the demands.  


||| 

“Why, in fact, does the programme contain demands for political democracy,
a militia, democratisation of the judicial system, etc., all of them
unrealisable under capitalism, but no demands for the right to work or a
ban on the introduction of labour-saving machinery, likewise unrealisable
under capitalism?” Two kinds of impossibility: “economically impossible”
and “politically precluded” (811). The present-day demands are “not in
an absolute sense” unrealisable under capitalism (812).  

  
 

Die Neue Zeit, 1911, 2 (29th year).


pp. 248 and 276. Minor “polemic” between
Karl Kautsky and Leipziger Volkszeitung (Rosa Luxemburg) over a
United States of Europe—remarks which do not touch on the
essence of the matter, but are indicative of the polemic that is being
conducted in Leipziger Volkszeitung.  

Leipziger Volkszeitung attacked also Ledebour for his
statement: 

“We put ... to capitalist society ... the demand ...  that they [the
statesmen] prepare to unite Europe in a United States of Europe in the
interests of Europe’s capitalist development, in order that later on Europe
shall not be completely ruined in world competition” (p. 276).  

This, it says, is the same argument Calwer used in urging a customs
union against America.  

Kautsky retorts: no, it is not the same. In Ledebour’s
statement there is not a word about a customs struggle,
only about a United States of Europe, “an idea which ...  is not
necessarily spearheaded against the U.S.A.” (277). ((Consequently, an idea
of peaceful competition!))  

Karl Kautsky, p. 248, says that both Parvus and Johann Philipp Becker
are (or were) in favour of a United States of Europe.  


Ibidem, pp. 943–44 (September 29, 1911), report of an article by
H. Quelch (in The Social-Democrat, 1911, August), who
says that the capitalists, too, favour peace (capital, he says, is
already international): capital can already create a “United
States of the World” (N.B.: sic! “of the world”), but this
world-wide trust would oppress the workers still more. “Capitalist world
peace... the all-powerful international police, nowhere any right of
political asylum... peace and tranquillity would prevail in this slave
state”... (p. 944).  

From the war Quelch (contrary to Karl Kautsky) expects
not revolution, but economic prosperity, deliverance from the
“pressure of production”.  

 

Die Neue Zeit, 1911, 2 (29th year,
2nd volume), No. 30, April 28, 1911 (pp. 97–107).  

Karl Kautsky, “War and Peace”.  

Karl Kautsky pronounces in favour of peace propaganda and
for United States of Europe (§ 3 of the article is
in fact headed: “A United States of Europe”).  

Karl Kautsky is against the proposal to decide beforehand to
reply to war by a strike (here there is a passage he quoted in
1915, that the people (“the population”), the “crowd”, would
itself kill opponents of the war if it considered the frontiers in danger,
if it feared invasion—p. 104, etc., etc.).  

But, in quoting such passages from this 1911 article,
Kautsky in 1915 did not quote the following
passages: 

1) In § 1: “Dynastic War and People’s War.” N.B. ((My
emphasis.))  

...“In the eighteenth century the princes regarded the states merely
as their domains....  

...“In the same way the capitalists of the various nations of
Europe (and of the U.S.A.) now regard the various nationalities outside
European civilisation as

 || 

their domains, and the antagonisms between the various capitalist
governments arise merely from the endeavour to enlarge or
round off these domains—the

 ||| 

colonies and ‘spheres of influence’. Just like the dynastic
antagonisms of the eighteenth century. And today the welfare
of the peoples of Europe is no more related to this than two
centuries ago”... (p. 99).  

2) “The conviction is growing that a European war

 || 
is bound, by natural necessity, to end in social
revolution. This is a strong, perhaps the strongest, motive for the

3) “War is followed by revolution with inevitable certainty, not as
the product of a Social-Democratic plan, but due to the iron
logic of things. The statesmen themselves now reckon with the
possibility of this outcome” (p. 106).  
 

...“Whether the revolution arises from the competition in armaments or
from war—it will in any case be an international
phenomenon” (p. 106)....  

...“Even if the revolution does not arise from reaction against the
burden of armaments or against the horrors of war, but from other causes,
and if at the outset it is not international, but restricted to a single
state, it cannot remain so for long under present
conditions. It [the revolution] is bound to spread to
other states”... (107).  And from this Karl Kautsky deduces the United
States of Europe “and its eventual expansion into the United States of the
civilised world”.  

p. 105: Karl Kautsky defines the United States of Europe
as an alliance “with a common trade policy” (++ a single
parliament, etc., a single army).

In § 1 of the article (p. 97), Karl Kautsky describes “the change
in the world situation” (“during the last two decades”)....
“Industrial capital has become finance capital, it has united with the
landowner-monopolists”.... “Social reform has come to a complete
standstill”....

“Nevertheless [despite all the difficulties of realising the United
States of Europe] the effort to peacefully unite the European states in a
federative community is by no means hopeless.  Its prospects are bound up
with those of the revolution” (K. Kautsky’s italics, p. 106).

Bauer’s article in the symposium Der Kampf (1911,

revolution leads to a European war, the inevitable result will be a
European revolution.”

“However aggressive Germany may be, her aggression concerns matters of as
little importance for the British people as the gold-mines in the
Transvaal.... But if, on the other hand, the actions of the British ruling
classes, as expressed in the policy of encirclement (etc.) directed against
Germany, are approved or permitted, then there really can come a time

 N.B.  || 

when even the proletariat will find itself compelled to take up arms and,
by defending the country, do the job of the capitalist class”... (p. 183).

Paish’s article (and its discussion in the
Statistical Society (article pp. 167–87; discussion, pp. 187–200)) shows that
the author was very cautious and careful.


He excluded conversions—taking not nominal, but issue prices of
securities—and to avoid duplication took income from
securities, etc. The value of his data is therefore
infinitely greater than that of the baseless “data”
on France and Germany.


His main work relates to 1907–08.

Themonopoly position of the farms (a region 50–100
km.  around the big towns) and the growth of
co-operatives are factors in favour of cartels in this field.


Followingthe invention of the centrifuge, co-operative dairy
associations sprang up like mushrooms after a warm spring rain:

Thegrowth of prices for concentrated fodder, etc. (++ 13–50 per cent,
1896–1906, p. 7) etc., did not result in a growth of prices,
until the strong cartel movement about 1900 (p. 7).  

Theenormous importance of large-scale production
(storage, etc.) of milk (in relation to cheapness, hygiene, etc., etc.)
favours cartels.

Deliveryis mostly by railway (50–100 km. from the town).
Virtual monopoly position of peasants in nearby areas engaged in
milk production.  

“Theco-operative movement has trained the farmer for the cartel”
(25).  

Thehistory of some milk cartels.  

TheBerlin Milk Cartel. Founded June 1900. A fierce
struggle against wholesale traders (the public supported the
traders).  
 


||
Bolle (the biggest Berlin milk firm—sells 45
million litres per annum; capital 10,000,000 marks; dividend 8 per cent,
p. 91) in 1903 made peace with the milk cartel.  (In a short time,
Bolle became a millionaire; as also Pfund in Dresden, who sells 21
million litres).  

Milksyndicates always improve hygienic conditions.  

Butthe present one was badly off financially and went
bankrupt on February 27, 1907.  

Hamburg.Founded in June 1900. During ten years it gave its
members 10.3 million marks (p. 53), raised their price (from
11.2 to 14.1 pfennigs), and concluded an agreement with the big traders.


Frankfurt-am-Main.When was it founded?? In 1911 it was
very powerful.  

Itconcluded an agreement with the traders. Afterwards it demanded that
they raise the price from 16 pfennigs to 17.  

“Overthis pfennig a three months’ bitter war broke out between the
farmers and the traders, who were supported both by the Social-Democratic
and liberal workers’ unions, and by the trade union association”
(p. 54). The traders gave way.  

“Thestruggle ended with traders, to the great astonishment of the
consumers, forming an alliance with Vereinigte Landwirte [the United
Farmers, a cartel], by which the latter were pledged not to deliver milk to
traders who did not join in the price increase” (p. 55).  


||large-scale production!! 

In Vienna there is a huge syndicate. It lowered sales costs from
7.67 hellers per litre in 1900 (turnover 0.56 million kronen) to 3.775
hollers in 1910 (turnover 6.74 million kronen) (p. 57).


Influenceof cartels on the producers?  

Pricesrose by an average of 2 pfennigs in 1900–10 (compared
with 1890–1900) (p. 61).  

Theprice rise was caused by the cartel (otherwise higher
production costs would not have increased the price).  

“Whatother explanation is there for the striking fact that prices
began to rise precisely in the years when the milk cartel appeared on the
scene?”  (63).  

“Lastly,what other explanation, save the existence of cartels, is
there for the fact that the highest price increases

    

were in the richest milk areas: Switzerland and W\"urttemberg?” (64).


Biggersales of milk worsen both food for cattle (p. 66) and
food for the population (67).  

Consumptionof milk in Switzerland 



 
 Litres per capita per day 




1903–05

Samein Germany.  

Effecton trade? Profits declined from 7–8 pfennigs per litre to 6–7
pfg. (72),—gradual squeezing out of trade.  

Onconsumers? Better quality, hygiene, etc.  

Bestof all in Basle, where the consumers’ association and
peasants’ milk association directly confront each other. The
milk trade is run by the city in an exemplary way, but
as regards prices the consumer is dependent on the
peasants!!  

“Accordingto Professor Kasdorf, the average daily milk yield of a cow
is 5 litres in Austria, 8–10 litres in Germany, and 12 litres in Denmark”
(p. 83).  

Milkproduction on Archduke Friedrich’s big farm near Vienna: 



1853—
3.00 litres per cow


1850—
4.67


1890—
6.27


1900—
6.86  (p. 84)


1910—
8.00




Small-scaletrade in milk still prevails (in Munich in 1910 there were
1,609 dairy shops, including

    


250  
selling up to 
50 litres


1,310 
(81.4%) up to 
150 litres)




conditions generally unhygienic; no safeguards against contamination when
the milk is poured, etc.  

 N.B.|| 

and “an incredible waste of time, labour and capital” (87), delivery,
unsold milk, 2–3 suppliers to a single house, etc., etc.  

“Thesocial effects of the milk cartel” (Chapter V)—the

 !!! ||| 

prospect is for an “armed peace” (95) between the town and
countryside, an outright war between consumers and sellers, as in Basle.

 

InBasle, the consumer depends a wholly (as regards price)
on the cartel of peasant milk producers.  


{{

Peasant dairy cartels are best of all organised in
Switzerland—and the price of milk is the highest of all!!  the power of
these cartels being greatest of all!!

 }}



“Thegeneral consumers’ association (in Basle)

 || 

finds its hands completely bound in face of the price policy of the
producers’ cartel” (p. 77).

 ||| N.B.  



“Evenin Switzerland, where direct relations between peasants and
workers are closer than in other countries, there have been hard-fought
battles and bitter price struggles between them” (p. 95).

    CAPITALIST ASSOCIATIONS ON THE WAR
   

Capitalist Associations on the war


N.B. 
Archiv f\"ur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik (Edgar
Jaffé) (Vol. 41, No. 1), 1915, September.  Pp. 296–97—“Employer
Organisations on the War”.  

...“Consequently [employer organisations] are thinking in terms of the
rise and development of a special German type; that is what the war is
about. That view, in fact,

 || N.B. 

fully coincides with the employers’ interests.  They are aware of a certain
danger to themselves if it were to be said after the war: vestra res agitur (the matter concerns
you), your skin and your interests are at stake!  The war
is being waged to decide who shall hold sway on the world
market!” (Deutsche Arbeitgeberzeitung, February 7, 1915).
In that event, obviously, all socio-political tendencies, all efforts to
cover war expenditure out of employer profits would find ready
acceptance. If,

    

however, the war is being waged in the interests of civilisation,
to defend a type of civilisation and not profit interests, then it falls to
Society as a whole to bear the burdens of war, and it will not be possible
to single out a class whose interests are pro-eminently promoted by the
war.  

|| 

The employers regard the effects of the war, insofar as they
extend to the internal political situation, as predominantly favourable.

 || 

This applies especially to its effect on the Socialist Party,

 || 

and in this respect they praise “fate as educator”.  For the war has led
to unity of the nation and has cut the ground from under the most
attractive socialist theories. (Ibid., August 2, 1915.)  In this war the
nation has for the first time really become a nation (to borrow
Treitschke’s expression)—and this is in itself justification for the
war.... For centuries to come, war will still be the sole form of settling
disputes between states,

 || 

and it is a form to be welcomed, for the war has halted the trend towards
democracy: “We have reached the limit of feebleness, the brink of
degeneration and debility. From the final extreme, however, from sinking
into the abyss, we have been saved by fate, which evidently has set our
German people a special goal.” (Ibid., August 16, 1914.)  

“The meaning of the war in general is thus consistently being sought
in a transformation of the soul; its serious economic and
political implications are belittled; its serious political and economic
consequences are rejected”.  

“The German Government’s further measures, it is correctly pointed
out, were likewise directed at regulating consumption, whereas the
aim of socialism is socialisation of the means of
production. (Ibid., February 28, 1915.) All these measures will
therefore be discontinued with the coming of peace. These views are, on the
whole, in the interests of the employers. And the antagonism between the
class interests of the employers and the workers probably

    

 || 

finds its most salient expression also in the contrasting way the war is
reflected in their ideologies.

 || 

But the contrast is of a manifold nature.  The socialists of the
opportunist, revisionist trend see the war as an economic
war. They take the view that the war is imperialist and even
defend the right of every nation to imperialism.  From that they deduce a
community of interests between employers and workers within the nation, and
that line,

 | 

followed consistently, leads to their becoming a radical bourgeois reform
party. On the other hand, the radical trend in the socialist workers’
movement, while regarding the war as imperialist (at any rate, with
reservations),

 || 

negates this development—it demands intensification of the class struggle
as a consequence of the war and emphasis on the proletarian standpoint,
even during the war. The employers, however, as we have seen, deny that the
war is an imperialist one. They do not want to be told: Tua res agitur (it is your concern). They
reject both the positive, affirmative imperialist view of the revisionist
socialists and the critical attitude of radical socialism.

 ||| well said! 

They seek salvation in the



“civilisation meaning” of the war, an interpretation that does not hold
any class responsible for the war, and does not accuse any class of
especially benefiting from it.

 ||| how nice! 

A grotesque picture: while the governments everywhere uphold the
imperialist theory or, at least” (how nice!!)

 [[DITTO: ||| ]] [[BOX: gem! ]] 

“contend that for the other side the economic interest is decisive, the
chief representatives of economic interests retire behind the general
civilisation meaning of the war.  As a result, they come into contact with
views to be found also in the camp of radical socialism; they regard the
war as economically only an interim phase; all war-time phenomena, all
measures taken by the state, stem from the present situation and will
disappear together with

    

the war. The employers’ views on the war, too, however much they may appear
to have a central idea, should therefore be regarded exclusively
as (class) ideology” (pp. 295–97). (End of article.)  

Note, pp. 293–94: 


N.B. || 

“A theoretical article in Deutsche Arbeitgeberzeitung (August 15,
1915) in which tendencies towards a new (democratic) orientation in home
policy are most emphatically rejected, is highly indicative....  

...“First of all, Social-Democracy has still more to
‘re-learn’:

 N.B.! | 

it will ‘above all have to show, after the war as well, whether the
process of transformation to which it refers has really become
part of its flesh and blood. Only if this has been decisively
demonstrated for a fairly lengthy period will one he able to say, with due
caution, whether some of these changes in Germany’s home policy are
possible’.” ...“In any case, so far there are no prerequisites for a
future

 || 

home policy (as urged by the Left parties).  ...On the contrary, ‘the harsh
school of war provides us with the strongest possible arguments against
further democratisation of our state system’” ...(p. 294).

“With less than a fifth the number of labourers, the product in the United

Agriculture in Japan has special features, it accounts for 60 per cent
of the population (p. 481). Out of a total number of households of
9,250,000, 3,748,000 are engaged exclusively in agriculture; 1,662,000
combine other occupations with agriculture. Other farmers =
70,000. Land-owners == 43,000. Σ == 5,523,000.  
 

The land is very heavily taxed. Agriculture is on an extremely small
scale:

The productivity of agricultural labour is extremely low, chiefly
owning to the small scale of agriculture and the absence of machines.  

In Japan, the production of rice requires 110 days’ labour per
acre.  

In Texas and Louisiana, the production of rice per acre requires one
man for two days ++ a team for 1 1/2 days.

     ARTICLE: “FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
       AND THE WAR DEBTS OF EUROPE”
   

The Economist, February 13,
1915. Article: “Financial Arrangements and the War Debts of Europe”....


...“The more one looks into the financial and political future of
Europe after the war the darker and more obscure do its problems
appear. But that is all the more reason why independent men with knowledge
and penetration and foresight should exercise their minds upon the
political economy of this war. Never has there been such a collision of
forces, never so much destruction in so short a time.  Never has it been so
difficult or so necessary to measure the calamity, to count the costs, to
foresee and provide against the consequences to human
society. Philanthropists profess to hope that the peace settlement will
bring with it a great international reduction of armies and armaments,
which will enable the nations to support their new war debt, and so to
avoid the

    

bankruptcy court. No doubt the fear of bankruptcy will count for something;
otherwise the peace settlement might be expected to breed another series of
preparations for another series of wars.

 N.B. || 

But those who know the forces which really control the diplomacy of Europe
see no Utopias. The outlook is for bloody revolutions and fierce wars
between labour and capital, or between the masses and the governing classes
of Continental Europe”. (End of article.)

emigrating to an empty uncolonised country and bringing their civilisation
to it, but the forced subjection of other peoples is already a
“debasement of this genuine nationalism” (“spurious
colonialism”); it is already a phenomenon of an imperialist order. A
model example of a real colony is seen in Canada and the self-governing
islands of Australasia.  


|| 
p. 6. “The novelty of the recent
Imperialism regarded as a policy consists chiefly in its adoption by
several nations. The notion of a number of competing empires
is essentially modern.”

 || N.B.


p. 9. “Nationalism is a plain highway to
internationalism, and if it manifests divergence we may well

 || 

suspect a perversion of its nature and its purpose.  Such a
perversion is Imperialism, in which

 || !! 

nations trespassing beyond the limits of facile assimilation transform the
wholesome stimulative rivalry of varied national types into the cut-throat
struggle of competing empires.”  

pp. 17–18. The nucleus of the British Empire is a population
of 40 million, living in an area of 120,000 square miles. During the last
generation alone, the increase in the possessions of the British
Empire = 4,754,000 sq. miles with 88,000,000 people.  
 

p. 19. The British colonies and dependencies in
1900 == 13,142,708 sq. miles with a population of 306,793,919
(*). 




[ 
N. B. Hobson includes the “protectorates” (Egypt,
Sudan, etc), which Morris does not!!
 ]




(*) Hobson here quotes Morris, II, 87 and R. Giffen: “The
Relative Growth of the Component Parts of Our Empire”, a paper read before
the Colonial Institute, January 1898.

 (Further, The Statesman’s Year-Book for 1900.) 

p. 20. Between 1884 and 1900, 3,711,957 square miles
(counting Sudan, etc.) with a population of 57,436,000 were added to
the British
       Empire.[1]


pp. 21–22. In Germany, literature on the necessity
for her to have colonial possessions arose in the seventies. The first
official aid to the German Commercial and Plantation Association of the
Southern Seas was given in 1880. The “German connection with Samoa”
belongs to the same period, but real imperialist policy in Germany began
from 1884, when the African protectorates arose and the islands of Oceania
were acquired. During the next fifteen years, a million square miles, with
a population of 14,000,000, in the colonies was brought under the influence
of Germany. Most of the territory was in the tropics, with only a few
thousand whites.  

In France, the old colonial spirit began to revive at the very
beginning of the eighties. The most influential economist conducting
colonial propaganda was Leroy-Beaulieu. In 1880, French possessions in
Senegal and Sahara were extended, a few years later Tunisia was acquired,
in 1884 France took an active part in the struggle for Africa and at the
same time strengthened her rule in Tonkin and Laos in Asia. Since 1880,
France acquired 3 1/2 million square miles with a population of 37,000,000
almost wholly in

    

tropical and subtropical countries, inhabited by lower races and unsuitable
for French colonisation.  

In 1880, Italy’s Abyssinian expedition came to grief and her
imperialist ambitions suffered defeat. Her possessions in East Africa were
limited to Eritrea and a protector ate in Somali.  

The African agreement of 1884–86 gave Portugal the extensive
region of Angola and the Congo Coast, and in 1891 a considerable part of
East Africa came under her political control.  

The Congo Free State, which became the property of the King of
Belgium in 1883 and which has been considerably enlarged since
then, must be regarded as a morsel seized by Belgium in the struggle for
Africa.  

Spain has been kept away from the arena of the struggle for
the world.  

Holland does not take part in the modern imperialist struggle;
her considerable possessions in the East and West Indies are of older
origin.  

Russia, the only one of the northern countries pursuing an
imperialist policy, directs her efforts chiefly to the seizure of Asia,
and, although her colonisation of Asia is more natural, since she proceeds
by extending her state frontiers, she will soon come into conflict with
other powers in regard to the division of Asia.  

p. 23. Altogether the European states + Turkey + China + the
United States of America, embracing an area of 15,813,201 square miles with
a population of 850,103,317, possess 136 colonies with an area of
22,273,858 square miles and a population of 521,108,791. (Taken wholly
from Morris, II, 318, as Hobson himself pointed out.)

p. 48. “The total emigration of Britons represents no large
proportion of the population; that proportion during the recent years of
imperial expansion has perceptibly diminished: of the emigrants a small
proportion settles in British possessions, and an infinitesimally small
fraction settles in the countries acquired under the new
Imperialism”.... 

Since 1884, the emigration figures have been
       falling[4]

:

 1884 ... 242,179 (including 155,280 to the United States)

p. 59. “In 1893 the British capital invested abroad

 15% ||| 

represented about 15 per cent of the total wealth of the United Kingdom:
nearly one-half of this capital (£770 mill.)  was in the form of
loans to foreign and colonial governments; of the rest a large pro portion
was invested in railways, banks, telegraphs and other public services,
owned, controlled, or vitally affected by governments, while most of the

 (*) 

remainder was placed in lands and mines, or in industries directly
dependent on land
      values.”[6]


The figure £1,698,000,000, according to Sir R. Giffen’s
calculations, should be considered less than the actual one.

N.B. 
p. 60. “It is not too much to say that the modern foreign policy
of Great Britain is primarily a struggle for profitable
markets of investment.”  

pp. 62–63. “Much, if not most, of the debts are ‘public’,
the credit is nearly always private....  

“Aggressive Imperialism, which costs the tax-payer so dear, which is
of so little value

 ||| 

to the manufacturer and trader ... is a source of great gain to the
investor....  

“The annual income Great Britain derives from commissions on her whole

explained by the income of

Investors are interested in lessening the risks connected with the
political conditions in the countries where they invest their capital.

 || N.B. 

“The investing and speculative classes in general also desire
that Great Britain should take other foreign areas under her flag in order
to secure new areas for profitable investment and speculation.”  

p. 63. “If the special interest of the investor is liable to
clash with the public interest and to induce a wrecking policy,

 ||| 

still more dangerous is the SPECIAL INTEREST OF THE FINANCIER, THE
GENERAL DEALER IN INVESTMENTS.  In large measure the rank and file of
the investors are, both for business and for politics, the cat’s-paw of the
great financial houses,

 ||| N.B. 

who use stocks and shares not so much as investments to yield them
interest, but as material for speculation in the money
market.”  

p. 68. “Such is the array of distinctively economic forces
making for Imperialism, a large loose group of trades and professions
seeking profitable business and lucrative employment from the expansion of
military and civil services, from the expenditure on military operations,
the opening up of new tracts of territory and trade with the same, and the
provision of new capital

    

 || 

which these operations require, all these finding their central guiding and
directing force in the power of the general
financier”. (Finance capital.) 

p. 72. The consequence of markets seized by France and Germany
being closed to Great Britain has been that the latter has closed her
markets to them. “Imperialism, when it has shaken off the ‘old gang’ of
politicians who had swallowed Free Trade doctrine when they were young,
will openly adopt the Protectionism required to round off this policy”
(72–73).... 

p. 78. The manufacturer and trader are satisfied by trading
with other nations; the investors of capital,

 ||| 

however, exert every effort “towards the political annexation of countries
which contain their more speculative investments”.  

Capital investment is advantageous for a country, opening new markets
for its trade “and employment for British enterprise”. To refrain from
“imperial expansion”

 || 

means to hand over the world to other nations. “Imperialism is thus seen
to be, not a choice, but a necessity” (= the view of the
imperialists).... 

pp. 80–81 (trusts). Free competition has always been
accompanied by “over-production”, which led to prices falling to such a
level as to remove weaker competitors from the arena of competition. The
first step in the formation of a trust is the closing down of the
worst-equipped and worst-situated factories, and the cutting of production
costs by using only the most up-to-date machines.  

“This concentration of industry in ‘trusts’ ... at once limits the
quantity of capital which can be effectively employed and increases the
share of profits out of which fresh savings and fresh capital will
spring.” The trust arises as an antidote to over-production, to excessive
investment of capital in the given industry; hence not all the capital
which the participants in the trust want to put into circulation can be
invested within the frame work of the trust. The trusts endeavour to invest
the

 ||| 

surplus capital so as “to establish similar combinations in other
industries, economising capital still further, and rendering it ever harder
for ordinary saving men to find investments for their savings”.  
 

pp. 82–84. America’s home market is saturated,
capital no longer finds investment.  

“It is this sudden demand for foreign markets for manufactures and for
investments which is avowedly

 || N.B. 

responsible for the adoption of Imperialism as a
political policy and practice by the Republican Party to which the great
industrial and financial chiefs belong, and which belongs to them.  The
adventurous enthusiasm of President Roosevelt and his ‘manifest destiny’
and ‘mission of civilisation’ party must not deceive us.

 || 
It is Messrs. Rockefeller, Pierpont Morgan, Hanna, Schwab, and
their associates who need Imperialism and who are fastening it
upon the shoulders of the great Republic of the West.

 ||| 

They need Imperialism because they desire to use the public resources of
their country to find profitable employment for the capital which otherwise
would be superfluous.  “It is not indeed necessary to own a country in
order to do trade with it or to invest capital in it,

 || 

and doubtless the United States can find some vent for its surplus goods
and capital in European countries.  But these countries are for the most
part able to make provision for themselves: most of them have erected
tariffs against manufacturing imports, and even Great Britain is being
urged to defend herself by reverting to Protection.  The big American
manufacturers and financiers will be compelled to look to China and the
Pacific and to South America for their most profitable
chances. Protectionists by principle and practice, they will insist upon
getting as close a monopoly of these markets as they can secure, and the
competition of Germany, England, and other trading nations will drive them
to the establishment of special political relations with the markets they
most prize.

 ||| 

Cuba, the Philippines, and Hawaii are but the hors d’oeuvre to
whet an appetite for an ampler banquet. Moreover, the powerful hold upon
politics which these industrial and financial magnates possess forms a
separate stimulus, which, as we have shown, is operative in Great

    

 N.B. || 

Britain and elsewhere; the public expenditure in pursuit of an imperial
career will be a separate immense source of profit to these men, as
financiers negotiating loans, shipbuilders and owners handling subsidies,
contractors and manufacturers of armaments and other imperialist
appliances.”  

p. 86. With the introduction of improved methods of
production, concentration of ownership and control, the capitalists find it
more and more difficult

 N.B. || 

“to dispose profitably of their economic resources, and they are tempted
more and more to use their governments in order to secure for their
particular use some distant undeveloped country by annexation and
protection”.  

At first sight it seems that the productive forces and capital have
outgrown consumption and cannot find application in their own
country. Therein, he says,

 ha-ha!!  the essence of philistine criticism of imperialism ||| 

lies the root of imperialism. But... “if the consuming public
in this country raised its standard of consumption to keep pace with every
rise of productive powers, there could be no excess of goods or capital
clamorous to use Imperialism in order to find markets”.  

p. 89. “The volume of production has been constantly rising
owing to the development of modern machinery.” Wealth can be used by the
population or by a handful of rich people. The level of wages puts a limit
on use by the population. Personal consumption by the rich, owing to their
small number, cannot absorb a very large quantity of products. “The rich
will never be so ingenious as to spend enough to prevent over-production.”
The chief part of production is devoted to “accumulation”. The stream
bearing this huge mass of products “is not only suddenly found to be
incapable of further enlargement, but actually seems to be in the process
of being dammed up”.  

p. 91. “Thus we reach the conclusion that Imperialism
is the endeavour of the great controllers of industry

 ||||| 

to broaden the channel for the flow of their surplus wealth by seeking
foreign markets and foreign
    

 ||||| 
investments to take off the goods and capital they cannot sell
or use at home.  


|| inevitability of imperialism 

“The fallacy of the supposed inevitability of
imperial expansion as a necessary outlet for progressive industry is now
manifest.

 || cf. K. Kautsky 
It is not industrial progress that demands the opening up of
new markets and areas of investment, but
MAL of consuming power which prevents the absorption
of commodities and capital within the country.”  


|| cf. K. Kautsky 
p. 94. “There is no necessity to open up new foreign markets; the
home markets are capable of indefinite expansion.”  

p. 96. “Trade unionism and socialism are thus the natural
enemies of imperialism, for they take away from the ‘imperialist’ classes
the surplus incomes which form the economic stimulus of imperialism.”


p. 100. “Imperialism, as we see, implies the use of the
machinery of government by private interests, mainly capitalist, to secure
for them economic gains outside their country.”  

“The average yearly value of our foreign trade for 1870–75,
amounting to £636,000,000, increased in the period 1895–98
to £737,000,000, the average public expenditure advanced
over the same period from £63,160,000 to £94,450,000. It is
faster than the growth of the aggregate national income,
which, according to the rough estimates of statisticians, advanced during
the same period from about £1,200,000,000 to
£1,700,000,000.”  

pp. 101–02. “This growth of naval and military expenditure
from about 25 to 60 millions in a little over a
quarter of a century is the most significant fact of
imperialist finance. The financial, industrial, and professional classes,
who, we have shown, form the economic core of Imperialism, have used their
political power to extract these sums from the nation in order

    

to improve their investments and open up new fields for capital, and to
find profitable markets for their surplus goods, while out of the public
sums expended

 || 

on these objects they reap other great private gains in the
shape of profitable contracts, and lucrative or honourable
employment.”  


|| 
p. 103. “While the directors of this definitely
parasitic policy are capitalists, the same motives
appeal to SPECIAL CLASSES OF THE WORKERS. In many towns most
important trades are dependent upon

 ||| 

government employment or contracts; the Imperialism of the metal and
shipbuilding centres is attributable in no small degree to this
       fact.”[8]


p. 114. “In other nations committed to or entering upon an
imperialist career with the same ganglia of

 ||| 
economic interests masquerading as patriotism, civilisation, and the
like, Protection has been the traditional finance, and it has only
been necessary to extend it and direct it into the necessary channels.”

 !!  1/37 || 

millions of British subjects outside these isles, not more than ten
millions, or one in thirty-seven, have any real
self-government for purposes of legislation and administration.”


p. 121. “In certain of our older Crown colonies there exists
a representative element in the government. While the
administration is entirely vested in a governor appointed by the Crown,
assisted by a council nominated by him, the colonists elect a
portion of the legislative assembly....  

“The representative element differs considerably in size

 || 

and influence, in these colonies, but nowhere does it outnumber the
non-elected element.  It thus becomes an advisory
rather than a really legislative factor. Not merely is the elected always
dominated in numbers by the non-elected element, but in all
    

 || 
cases the veto of the Colonial Office is freely exercised upon
measures passed by the assemblies. To this it should be added that in
nearly all cases a

 ||| 
fairly high property qualification is attached to the
franchise, precluding the coloured people from exercising an elective power
proportionate to their numbers and their stake in the country.”  


||| 
p. 131. “In a single word, the new Imperialism has
increased the area of British despotism, far outbalancing the
progress in population and in practical freedom attained by our few
democratic colonies.  

“It has not made for the spread of British liberty and for the
propagation of our arts of government. The

 ||| 

lands and population which we have annexed we govern, insofar as we govern
these at all, by distinctively autocratic
methods, administered chiefly from Downing Street, but partly
from centres of colonial government, in cases where self-governing colonies
have been permitted to annex.”  


||| 
p. 133. “The pax Britannica, always an impudent
falsehood, has become of recent years a grotesque monster of
hypocrisy; along our Indian frontiers, in West Africa,

 ||| 

in the Sudan, in Uganda, in Rhodesia, fighting has been
well-nigh incessant.” 

p. 134. “Our economic analysis has disclosed the fact that it
is only the interests of competing cliques of
business men—investors, contractors, export
manufacturers, and certain professional classes—that are antagonistic;
that these cliques, usurping the authority and voice of the
people, use the public resources to push their private businesses, and
spend the blood and money of the people in this vast and

 ||| 

disastrous military game, feigning national antagonisms
which have no basis in reality.”

 |||




|| 
pp. 135–36. “If we are to hold all that we have
taken since 1870 and to compete with the new industrial nations in the
further partition of empires or spheres of influence in Africa and Asia,
we must be prepared to fight. The enmity of rival empires,
openly displayed throughout the South African war,

    

 || 

is admittedly due to the policy by which we have forestalled, and are still
seeking to forestall, these

 || 

rivals in the annexation of territory and of markets
throughout the world.”

with ‘civilised’ weapons, drilled in ‘civilised’ methods, and commanded by

farthest. Most of the fighting by which we have won our Indian

would be constantly imperilled by the ‘lower

tactics now discarded by the ‘civilised races’, would overwhelm them in
barbarian incursions, even as the ruder European and Asiatic races
overwhelmed the Roman Empire.”

Professor Giddings does not seem to recognise that the entire weight of the
ethical validity of this curious doctrine
of retrospective consent is thrown upon the act of judging the degree
of probability that a free and rational consent will be given, that
his doctrine furnishes no sort of security for a competent, unbiassed
judgement, and that, in point of fact,

IT ENDOWS ANY NATION WITH THE RIGHT TO SEIZE AND ADMINISTER THE TERRITORY

equating the two groups of results?

pp. 227–28. “Jingoism is merely the lust of
the spectator, unpurged by any personal effort, risk, or sacrifice,
gloating in the perils, pains, and slaughter of fellow-men whom he does not
know, but whose destruction he desires in a blind and artificially
stimulated passion of hatred and revenge. In the Jingo all
is concentrated on the hazard and blind fury of the fray. The arduous and
weary monotony of the march, the long periods of waiting, the hard
privations, the terrible tedium of a prolonged campaign, play no part in
his imagination; the redeeming factors of war, the fine sense of
comradeship which common personal peril educates, the fruits of discipline
and self-restraint, the respect for the personality of enemies whose
courage he must admit and whom he comes to realise as

fellow-beings—all these moderating elements in actual war are
eliminated from the passion of the Jingo. It is
precisely for these reasons

undergo military service and the experience of an invasion.

no small

“Tricked out with the real or sham glories of military heroism and the
magnificent claims of empire-making,

Jingoism becomes a NUCLEUS OF A SORT OF PATRIOTISM which
can be moved to any folly or to any crime.”


pp. 232–33. “The area of danger is, of course, far wider
than Imperialism, covering the whole field of vested
interests.  But, if the analysis of previous chapters is correct,
Imperialism stands as a first defence of these interests: for the
financial and speculative classes it means a pushing of
their private businesses at the public expense, for the export
manufacturers and merchants a forcible enlargement of
foreign markets and a related policy of Protection,

for the official and professional classes large
openings of honourable and lucrative employment, for the
Church it represents the temper and practice of authority
and the assertion of spiritual control over vast multitudes of lower

diversion of the forces of democracy and the opening
of great public careers in the showy work of empire-making.”

p. 238. Mr. Kidd, Professor Giddings and the
“Fabian” (N.B.) Imperialists
ascribe the need for “a control of the tropics by ‘civilised’ nations” to
material necessity. The natural riches of tropical countries “are
of vital importance to the maintenance and progress of
Western civilisation.\dots Partly

    

from sheer growth of population in temperate zones, partly from the rising
standard of material life, this dependence of the temperate on the tropical
countries must grow”. Ever larger areas of the tropical countries have to
be cultivated. At the same time, owing to the characteristics which the hot
climate develops in the local inhabitants, the latter are incapable of
progress:
they are feckless, their wants do not grow larger. “The resources of the
tropics will not be developed voluntarily by the natives themselves”
(239).  

pp. 239–40. “We cannot, it is held, leave these lands
barren; it is our duty to see that they are developed for the good
of the world. White men cannot ‘colonise’ these lands and, thus settling,
develop the natural resources by the labour of their

own hands; they can only organise and superintend the labour
of the natives. By doing this they can educate the natives
in the arts of industry and stimulate in them a desire for material and
moral progress, implanting new ‘wants’ which form in every society the
roots of civilisation.”  

p. 251. “In a word, until some genuine international council
exists, which shall accredit a civilised nation with the duty of educating
a lower race, the

pp. 253–54. A trust of the chief European powers would mean
the exploitation of the non-European countries. The Europeans’ rule in
China “sufficiently exposes the hollowness in actual history of the claims
that considerations of a trust for civilisation animate and regulate the
foreign policy of Christendom, or of its component

that of Johannesburg and Rhodesia; for there, if anywhere, we lay our
finger on the difference between

a ‘sane’ Imperialism, devoted to the protection,

hands over these races to the economic exploitation of white colonists who
will use them as ‘live tools’, and their lands as repositories of mining or
other profitable treasure.”  

p. 262 (note). “In the British Protectorate of Zanzibar and
Pemba, however, slavery still

p. 264. “The real history of Imperialism as
distinguished from Colonialism clearly illustrates this tendency”
(the tendency to make the natives exploit their land for
our benefit). 

p. 265. “In most parts of the world a purely or distinctively
commercial motive and conduct have furnished the nucleus
out of which Imperialism has grown, the early trading
settlement becoming an industrial settlement, with land and
mineral concessions

growing round it, an industrial settlement involving
force for protection, for securing further concessions,
and for checking or punishing infringements of agreement or breaches of
order; other interests, political and

    

religious, enter in more largely, the original commercial settlement
assumes a stronger political and military character, the reins of
government are commonly taken over by the State
from the company, and a vaguely defined
protectorate passes gradually into the form of a colony.”  

p. 270. The local inhabitants are forcibly compelled to work
for industrial companies; this is

sometimes done in the guise of organising a “militia” from the local
population, ostensibly for defence of the country but in fact it has to

adventurer who has come to the country, which is thereafter regarded as the
ally (colony) of the country from which he has come, France or Great
Britain.  

p. 280. Where direct slavery has been abolished,
taxation is the means by which the natives are forced to go
to work. “These taxes are not infrequently applied so as to dispossess natives of their land, force them to work for
wages, and even to drive them into insurrections which are followed by
wholesale measures of confiscation.”  

p. 293. “But so long as the private, short-sighted business
interests of white farmers or white mine-owners are permitted, either by
action taken on their own account or through pressure on a Colonial or
Imperial Government, to invade the lands of ‘lower peoples’, and transfer
to their private profitable purposes the land or labour, the first law of
‘sane’ Imperialism is violated, and the

phrases about teaching ‘the dignity of labour’
and raising races of ‘children’ to manhood, whether used by directors of
mining companies or by statesmen in the House of Commons, are little
better

p. 295. “The stamp of ‘parasitism’ is upon every
white settlement among these lower races, that is to say,
nowhere are the relations between whites and coloured people such as to
preserve a wholesome balance of mutual services. The best services which
white civilisation might be capable of rendering, by examples of normal,
healthy, white communities practising the best arts of Western life, are
precluded by climatic and other physical conditions in almost

every case: the presence of a scattering of white officials,
missionaries, traders, mining or plantation overseers, a
dominant male caste with little knowledge of or sympathy
for the institutions of the people, is ill-calculated to give to these
lower races even such gains as Western civilisation might be capable of
giving.”  

p. 301. “The Rev. J. M. Bovill, rector of the Cathedral
Church”, is “the professional harmoniser of God and
Mammon”. In his book Natives under the Transvaal Flag, he
describes how the natives are allowed to erect tents near the mines, which
enables them to “live more or less under the same conditions as they do in
their native kraals”. All this is mere hypocritical
phrase-mongering; the life of the natives “is entirely agricultural and
pastoral”, but they are compelled to labour in the mines for a
wage.  

p. 304. “The natives upon their locations will be ascripti glebae, living in complete serfdom, with
no vote or other political means of venting their grievances, and with no
economic leverage for progress.”

advantages which certain interests suck out of empire.”  

p. 324. “The new Imperialism differs from the
older, first, in substituting for the ambition of a single growing empire
the theory and the practice of competing empires, each
motived by similar lusts of political aggrandisement and commercial gain;
secondly, in the dominance of financial or

pp. 329–30. “It is at least conceivable that China might so
turn the tables upon the Western industrial nations, and, either by
adopting their capital and organisers or, as is more probable, by
substituting her own, might flood their markets with her cheaper
manufactures, and refusing their imports in exchange might take her payment
in liens upon their capital, reversing the earlier process of investment
until she gradually obtained financial control over her quondam patrons and
civilisers. This is no idle speculation.” (China may awaken)....


pp. 332–33. “Militarism may long survive, for that, as has
been shown, is serviceable in many ways to the maintenance of a
plutocracy. Its expenditure furnishes a profitable
support to certain strong vested interests, it is a
decorative element in social life, and

 ||| 
above all it is necessary to keep down the
pressure of the forces of internal reform. Everywhere the power of capital
in its more concentrated forms is better organised than the power of
labour, and has reached a further stage in its development; while
labour

has talked of international co-operation, capital has been achieving
it. So far, therefore, as the greatest financial and commercial

    

interests are concerned, it seems quite probable that the coming generation
may witness

so powerful an international union as to render wars between the
Western nations almost impossible. Notwithstanding the selfish
jealousies and the dog-in-the-manger policies which at present weaken
European action in the Far East, the real drama will begin when
the forces of international capitalism, claiming to represent the
civilisation of united

 ||| (( “a United States of Europe” 

Christendom, are brought to bear on the peaceful opening up
of China. It is then that the real
‘yellow peril’ will begin. If it is unreasonable to expect that China can
develop a national patriotism which will
enable her to expel the Western exploiters, she must then be
subjected to a process of disintegration, which is more aptly
described as ‘the break-up’ of China than by the term ‘development’.  

 ||| 

“Not until then shall we realise the full risks and
folly of the most stupendous revolutionary
enterprise history has known. The Western nations may then awaken to the
fact that they have permitted certain

 ||| 

little cliques of private profit-mongers to engage them in a piece of
Imperialism in which every cost and peril of that hazardous policy
is multiplied a hundred-fold, and from which there
appears no possibility of safe withdrawal.”  

p. 335. ((N.B.: the prospect of parasitism.)) “The

 || 
greater part of Western Europe might
then assume the appearance and character already exhibited
by tracts of country in the South of England,
in the Riviera, and in the tourist-ridden or residential
parts of Italy and Switzerland, little
clusters of wealthy aristocrats drawing dividends
and pensions from the Far East, with a somewhat larger group of
professional retainers and tradesmen and a larger body of
personal servants and workers in the transport trade
and in the final stages of

    

production of the more perishable goods: all the main arterial

 ||| 

industries would have disappeared, the staple foods and manufactures
flowing in as tribute from Asia and
    Africa.”[13]


p. 337. “But the economic raison d’êre of
Imperialism in the opening up of China is, as we see, quite other than the
maintenance of ordinary commerce: it consists in establishing a vast new
market for Western investors, the profits of which will represent the gains
of an investing class and not the gains of whole peoples. The normal
healthy processes of assimilation of increased world-wealth by nations are
inhibited by

 essence of imperialism || 

the nature of this Imperialism, whose essence consists in
developing markets for investment, not for trade, and in using the
superior economies of cheap foreign production to supersede the industries
of their own nation, and to maintain the political and economic domination
of a class.”  

p. 346. “For Europe to rule
Asia by force for purposes of gain, and to justify that
rule by the pretence that she is civilising Asia and raising her to a
higher level of spiritual life, will be adjudged by history, perhaps,
to be the crowning wrong and folly of
Imperialism. What Asia has to give, her priceless stores of
wisdom garnered from her experience of ages, we refuse to take; the much or
little which we could give we spoil by the

brutal manner of our giving.  This is what Imperialism has
done, and is doing, for Asia.”

country and her self-governing and practically independent colonies.’ ”But federation is better, for then Ireland
would remain an integral part of Great

    

Britain, whereas with self-governing colonies the connection is only a
moral one. At the present time the development of democracy is towards

pp. 355–56. The “United Kingdom”, with the present
imperialist policy, “cannot bear the financial strain of the necessary
increase of ships without substantial colonial assistance”. This can lead
to the separation of the colonies, whose interests are not bound up with
(Great Britain’s) imperialist policy, in deciding which (policy)
they can have no voice. Each of them—as a federal country—would have
only an insignificant minority, in view of the huge number of British
colonies, which in most cases have very little in common. “Imperial
federation” is advantageous to Great Britain and disadvantageous to the
colonies.  

p. 373. “The new Imperialism kills a

ever-larger proportion of their incomes from capital invested outside the

political control is a revolutionary force in modern
politics; it means a constantly growing tendency to use their political
power as citizens of this state to interfere with the
political condition of those States where they have an industrial stake.


“The essentially illicit nature of this use of the

pp. 382–83. “Imperialism is only beginning to
realise its full resources, and to develop into a fine art the management
of nations: the broad bestowal of a franchise, wielded by a people whose

by controlling the press, the schools, and where necessary the churches,
impose Imperialism upon the masses under the attractive guise of
sensational patriotism.  

“The chief economic source of Imperialism has been
found in the inequality of industrial opportunities by
which a favoured class accumulates superfluous elements of income which, in
their search for profitable investments, press ever farther afield: the
influence on State policy of these investors and their financial managers
secures a national alliance of other vested interests which
are threatened by movements of social reform: the adoption of
Imperialism thus serves the double purpose
of securing private material benefits for favoured classes of
investors and traders at the public cost, while sustaining the
general cause of conservatism by diverting
public energy and interest from domestic agitation to external
employment.”  

p. 383. “To term Imperialism a

and social condition of districts in Southern England
today which

       

       || || || ||
 || || || ||
 || ||

     ARE ALREADY REDUCED TO THIS CONDITION, and
reflect upon the vast extension of such
a system which might be rendered feasible
by the subjection of China to
the economic control of similar groups of
financiers, investors, and political
and business officials, draining the greatest
potential reservoir of profit the world has ever
known, in order to consume it in
Europe. The situation is far too complex, the
play of world forces far too incalculable, to render
this or any other single interpretation of the future very
probable; but the influences which govern the
Imperialism of Western Europe

 true 
 |||| |||| 
     today are moving in this
direction, and, unless counteracted
or
 diverted, make towards some such
 consummation.[16]


“If the ruling classes of the Western nations could
realise their interests in such a combination (and each year sees
capitalism more obviously international), and if China were unable to
develop powers of forcible resistance, the opportunity of a
parasitic Imperialism which should reproduce upon a
vaster scale many of the main features of the later Roman Empire
visibly presents itself.”  
 

p. 389. “The new Imperialism differs in
no vital point from this old example” (the Roman Empire). It is just as
much a parasite. But the laws of nature, which doom
parasites to destruction, apply not only to individuals,
but to nations. The complexity of the process and disguising its substance
can delay but not avert final collapse. “The claim that an
imperial state forcibly subjugating other peoples and their
lands does so for the purpose of rendering services to the conquered equal
to those which she exacts is notoriously false: she neither
intends equivalent services nor is capable of rendering them.”

The extracts and accounts of various passages from Hobson’s book were
made by N. K. Krupskaya. In going though the extracts, Lenin underlined
some passages, wrote comments and made notes

   

in the margin. The pages of the notebook were numbered by Lenin. His
underlining is shown by the following type variations:

a single underlining—italics;

a double underlining—spaced italics;

three lines—small heavy italics;

a single wavy line—CAPITAL LETTERS;

a double wavy line—SPACED CAPITAL LETTERS.

All Lenin’s additions have been set in a heavy face;

where these were once underlined—heavy italics,

where twice underlined—spaced heavy italics.  

In the preface to Imperialism, the Highest Stage of
Capitalism, Lenin pointed out that he had made use of the book by
I. A. Hobson with all the care it merited. John Atkinson Hobson
(1858–1940) was a well-known British economist, whose point of view was
that of a bourgeois reformist and pacifist. The best-known of his writings
are Problems of Poverty, The Evolution of Modern Capitalism and
Imperialism. Lenin described the last-named as the “principal
English work on imperialism” and a typical example of the petty-bourgeois
criticism of imperialism. Lenin points out that Hobson’s book “gives a
very good and comprehensive description of the principal specific economic
and political features of imperialism”

(see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 195).

In the Notebooks on Imperialism, Lenin writes that “Hobson’s book
on imperialism is useful in general, and especially useful because it helps
to reveal the basic falsity of Kautskyism on this subject”

(see p. 116 of this volume).

While making use of Hobson’s rich factual data, Lenin criticised his
reformist conclusions and his attempts, albeit veiled, to defend
imperialism.

The Boer war (1899–1902)—a colonial, predatory war of Great
Britain against the South African republics, the Transvaal and Orange Free
State, as a result of which these became British colonies.

Lenin inserted here in the manuscript: “see the addition above, p. 7
of this notebook”. And at the top of p. 7 he wrote: “(see p. 41 of this
notebook)”. Following this indication, the extract from p. 7 of the
notebook has been included in the volume according to the sequence of the
extracts from Hobson’s book, and not according to the pagination of the
notebook.
