Mikhailov first put in an appearance at St. Petersburg in
1891 as a Kharkov student expelled for making trouble.  He entered a
student organisation which bore the name of
“corporation”{8} even after it fell apart. There was a rumour at the
dental courses about his behaviour during a suspicious acquaintanceship; he
was accused of spending money collect ed for the famine-stricken, but he
made good the loss. At that time, he became intimate

       with....{1}


In January 1894, a search was also carried out in the homes of many
former members of the said “corporation”, including Mikhailov himself. At
the interrogations, all heard a detailed reading on the membership of the
society, etc. The gendarmes declared that the case arose on the strength of
information supplied by a former member. Mikhailov was cleared of all
suspicion by the gendarmes saying that importance had been attached to this
trivial case only because an obvious revolutionary was involved in it. At
the same time, a strike took place at the Voronin
factory.{9} Mikhailov insinuated himself among them and started to make
collections for their benefit. In February, eight workers who had dealt
with Mikhailov and one student who had collected money on his assignment
(Talalayev) were arrested. After that Mikhailov again started to edge
closer to the
      ouvriers{2}

and managed to penetrate into circles

    

led by
Narodovoltsi.{10} The latter were arrested in the summer of 1894. The
inquiry revealed that the police had been informed of a great deal. At the
inquiry involving our Stariki there was the charge that they were
acquainted with some of these Narodovoltsi, but it
     happened....{3}

The first Mikhailov case came to an end soon after:
 ...{4}

and others were exiled, but he was let off and told everyone that he had
petitioned for clemency and that he had done so with the intention of
continuing to work on the old lines. Unfortunately, some people failed to
regard this fact as being sufficiently disgraceful and gave him their
patronage, so that he who did not command any personal respect among the
workers was given an opportunity to consolidate and extend his ties.  

There follows a description of his methods, his pressing of money on
workers, his invitations to them to visit him at home, the revelation of
Party names, etc. In this way and because he enjoyed the full confidence of
the said persons, he soon discovered the identity of many members of
various groups. They were all arrested. When a worker
...{5}

said that he had received books from Mikhailov, the latter was detained,
but at once released and is still in St. Petersburg. As one of the accused
at the inquiry, he informed on all his comrades; some of the accused
...{6}

were read his detailed report on the membership of various
groups. (Signatures.)

The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class
was organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895. It united about twenty
Marxist workers’ circles in St. Petersburg. The work of the League was
based on the principles of centralism and strict discipline. It was headed
by a Central Group, which included V. I. Lenin, A. A. Vaneyev,
P. K. Zaporozhets, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, N. K. Krupskaya, L. Martov
(Y. 0. Tsederbaum), M. A. Silvin, and V. V. Starkey. Immediate guidance on
every aspect of the work came from five members of this group led by
Lenin. The organisation was subdivided into, district groups connected with
factories and plants through forward-looking, class conscious workers (like
I. V. Babushkin and V. A. Shelgunov). At the plants there were organisers
for the collection of information and distribution of literature, and
workers’ circles were set up at the major enterprises.  

The League was the first in Russia to bring together socialism and the
working-class movement, going forward from the propaganda of Marxism among
a small number of leading workers in circles to political agitation among
broad masses of the proletariat. It guided the working-class movement,
tying in the workers’ struggle far economic demands with the political
struggle against tsarism. The influence of the League spread well beyond
St. Petersburg. On its initiative, the workers’ circles in Moscow, Kiev,
Yekaterinoslav and other cities and regions of Russia united into similar
leagues.  

In December 1895, the tsarist government dealt the League a heavy blow:
on the night of the 8th (20th), many of its leaders, including Lenin, were
arrested. In response to the arrest, a leaflet was issued, formulating
political demands and proclaiming the existence of the League.  

While in prison, Lenin continued to direct the League’s activities,
sending out coded letters and leaflets, and wrote a pamphlet On
Strikes (which is yet to be discovered) and “Draft and Explanation of
the Social-Democratic Party Programme” (see present edition, Vol. 2,
pp. 93–121).  

The importance of the League lay in the fact that, as Lenin said, it
was the first important embryo of a revolutionary party relying on the
working-class movement and directing the proletariat’s class struggle.


“Communication on Behalf of the ‘Stariki’ to the Members of the
St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working
Class” was Written by Lenin in prison in 1896 as a warning

   

to the League members at liberty against the provocateur N. Mikhailov. It
was written between the lines of page 240 of N. I. Tezyakov’s book,
Agricultural Workers and the Organisation of Sanitary Supervision over
Them in Kherson Gubernia (1896), which Lenin was reading for his work
The Development of Capitalism in Russia.  

Apparently for reasons of secrecy, the manuscript contains a great
number of abbreviations and is written in a very fine hand with a plain
lead pencil poorly visible in places, which is why some of it has not been
deciphered.

p. 33

The student organisation bearing the name of “corporation” was set up
in St. Petersburg University at the end of 1891 from students’
self-education circles. It united revolutionary-minded young people, but
had no specified political programme and broke up within a few months. Its
members were betrayed to the police by N. Mikhailov, who was one of its
organisers but was connected with the secret police.

p. 33





{9}

The strike at the Voronin factory (a cotton-weaving manufactory owned
by the merchant I. A. Voronin) was staged at the end of January 1894 and
was caused by a cut in rates which led to a drop in wages. It continued for
three days and ended in a victory for the workers: the rates were
increased. Several workers, accused of being instigators, were arrested and
deported from St. Petersburg.

p. 33





{10}

Narodovoltsi—members of the Narodnaya Volya (the People’s
Will), a secret political organisation of Narodnik terrorists which arose
in August 1879 as a result of the split within the Narodnik organisation
known as Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom). The Narodnaya Volya was headed
by an Executive Committee consisting, among others, of A. I. Zhelyabov,
A. D. Mikhailov, M. F. Frolenko, N. A. Morozov, V. N. Figner,
S. L. Perovskaya and A. A. Kvyatkovsky. The Narodovoltsi, remaining utopian
socialists, took the path of political struggle, and regarded as their main
task the overthrow of the autocracy and the gaining of political
freedom. Their programme provided for the organisation of a “permanent
people’s representation” elected on the basis of universal suffrage,
proclamation of democratic freedoms, transfer of the land to the people and
the working out of measures for the transfer of factories and plants to the
workers. Lenin wrote: “The Narodnaya Volya members made a step forward
when they took up the political struggle, but they fail ad to connect it
with socialism” (present edition, Vol. 8, p. 72).  

The Narodovoltsi waged a heroic struggle against the tsarist
autocracy. But proceeding from their erroneous theory of active “heroes”
and the passive “crowd”, they expected to achieve the reconstruction of
society without the people’s participation, through their own efforts, and
by individual acts of terrorism to intimidate and disorganise the
government. Following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II on March 1,
1881, the government crushed the

   

Narodnaya Volya by provocations, fierce reprisals and executions.  

Lenin, while criticising the erroneous and utopian programme of the
Narodovoltsi, spoke with great respect about their selfless struggle
against tsarism and put a high value on their conspiratorial techniques and
strictly centralised organisation.

The draft agreement with P. B. Struve was worked out as a result of the
talks held by V. I. Lenin, V. I. Zasulich and A. N. Potresov with Struve,
which had been started on Potresov’s initiative on December 29, 1900 (see
present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 380–82). The “legal Marxists” (mentioned in
the document as the Svoboda [Freedom] democratic opposition group) Struve
and M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky wanted the establishment of an illegal organ
abroad (suggesting the name of Sovremennoye Obozreniye
[Contemporary Review]) to be published parallel with Iskra and
Zarya, but not openly connected with the Social-Democrats. The
Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya agreed to participate
in the publication, hoping to obtain political material and reports for
Iskra through Struve, but stipulated that the new organ should
appear not more often than Zarya and as a supplement to it. The
Editorial Board was to consist, on an aqua I footing, of the Iskra
Editorial Board, and Struve and Tugan-Baranovsky.  

The talks revealed that Struve intended to use the Editorial Board of
Iskra and Zarya to cater for Sovremennoye
Obozreniye and was trying to turn it into an organ competing with
Iskra in volume, content and frequency of publication. When the
draft agreement was being worked out, Struve rejected Clause 7, which had
been proposed by the Iskra and Zarya group and which gave
the Iskra Editorial Board a completely free hand in making use of
all the political material received by Sovremennoye
Obozreniye. Lenin set out the content of the talks with Struve in a
letter to 0. V. Plekhanov on January 30, 1901, and came out strongly for
breaking off the talks (see present edition, Vol. 84, pp. 55–57). The
subsequent talks ended in a complete break.

Zarya (Dawn)—a Marxist scientific and political journal
published in Stuttgart in 1901 and 1902 by the Iskra Editorial
Board. Altogether four issues (three books) of Zarya made their
appearance: No. 1 in April 1904 (actually March 23, new style), No. 2–3 in
December 1901, and No. 4 in August 1902.  

Zarya’s tasks were defined in a draft declaration by the
Iskra and Zarya Editorial Board, written by Lenin in
Russia (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 320-30). In view of the fact that
during the discussion of the publication of these organs abroad, jointly
with the Emancipation of Labour group, it had been decided to publish
Zarya legally and Iskra illegally, the declaration of the
Iskra Editorial Board in October 1900 no longer made mention of
Zarya.  

The journal Zarya criticised international and Russian
revisionism and came out in defence of the theoretical principles of
Marxism. Some of Lenin’s works, Including “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo
and the Hannibals of Liberalism” and “The

   

Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”, were published in
Zarya.

We draw readers’ attention to Witte’s minute published by
Zarya,{1} which appeared in the hands of Dietz in Stuttgart. The minute,
aimed against the draft of the former Minister for the Interior Goremykin
on the

    

introduction of Zemstvos in non-Zemstvo

gubernias,{2} is interesting as a document giving a brazen exposé
of our rulers’ most secret yearnings. We hope to deal in detail with this
remarkable document and with Mr. R.N.S.’s introduction to it in the next
issue of our

newspaper.{3} This introduction, while showing that its author is aware
of the political importance of the Russian working-class movement, is in
all other respects marked with the usual immaturity of political thinking
so characteristic of our liberals.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

A reference to Minister of Finance S. Y. Witte’s confidential minute,
“The Autocracy and the Zemstvo” (1899), with an introduction and notes by
R.N.S. (P. B. Struve), published by the Zarya Publishers in 1901.  



{2}

The Zemstvos were introduced in the central gubernias of
Russia in 1864 and were local organs of self-government led by the
gentry. Their writ was confined to local economic matters (hospitals,
highways, statistics, insurance, etc.). Their activity was entirely under
the control of the governors and the tsarist Ministry of the Interior, who
could suspend any decisions the government did not like.

p. 36





{3}

A reference to the newspaper Iskra, the first all-Russia
illegal Marxist newspaper, founded by Lenin in 1900, which played a
decisive part in organising the revolutionary Marxist party of the working
class.  

The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra dated December 1900 appeared
in Leipzig; subsequent issues appeared in Munich; from July 1902, in
London; and from the spring of 1903, in Geneva. German Social-Democrats,
Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun and others, the Polish revolutionary Julian
Marchlewski who was living in Munich at the time, and Harry Quelch, a
leader of the British Social-Democratic Federation, rendered great
assistance in starting the newspaper (organising a secret printing-press,
buying Russian type, etc.).  

On Iskra’s Editorial Board were V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov,
L. Martov, P. B. Axelrod, A. N. Potresov and V. I. Zasulich. Its secretary
was I. G. Smidovich-Lehmann, and from the spring of 1901, N. K. Krupskaya,
who was also in charge of Iskra’s correspondence with
Social-Democratic organisations in Russia. Lenin was the virtual
editor-in-chief and head of Iskra; he wrote articles on all the
cardinal aspects of Party organisation and the class struggle of the
proletariat in Russia.  

Iskra became the centre round which the Party forces rallied
and which gathered and trained the Party cadres. R.S.D.L.P. groups and
committees, supporting the views put forward by Lenin’s Iskra,
were set up in a number of cities in Russia (St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Samara, etc.) and the Iskra organisation in Russia was set up at a
congress of Iskra followers in Samara in January 1902.  

On Lenin’s initiative and with his direct participation, the
Iskra Editorial Board worked out a draft art programme (published
in Iskra No. 21) and prepared the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. In a special resolution, the Congress noted the exceptional role
played by Iskra in the struggle for the Party and proclaimed it
the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.  

Soon after the Second Congress of the Party, the Mensheviks, wish
Plekhanov’s support, took over control of Iskra. From its No. 52
Iskra ceased to be an organ of revolutionary Marxism.

Pp.  

1.  The author regards as being of primary importance what Marx said
(about the two ways) in exceptional circumstances and in virtually
conditional
terms.{6} However, the author distorts the fact, creating the impression
that it was Marx himself who actually raised the question of the
two ways.  

7. “Laughter” at the men of the 70s (facing history) shows

n o t

“only an absolute incapacity for taking the historical standpoint”, it is
also evidence of theoretical disparagement of the men of the 70s,
as compared with those of the 40s and 60s.

Noumena and phenomena—opposite concepts in Kant’s idealistic
philosophy.  

Kant held a noumenon to be an incognisable thing in itself, which
existed independently of man’s consciousness and was beyond his grasp. A
phenomenon existed only in the mind and was an object of cognition.  

This antithesis between noumena and phenomena, which is one of the main
p repositions of Kant’s subjective idealist epistemology, is used by the
ideologists of imperialism and revisionists in their fight against
materialism.  

Dialectical materialism rejected this antithesis and proved that Kant’s
theory is wrong.

RECORD OF POINTS ONE AND TWO OF PLEKHANOV’S =
FIRST DRAFT PROGRAMME, AND OUTLINE OF POINT =
ONE OF THE PROGRAMME’S THEORETICAL SECTION =


I. The capitalist mode of production is the economic foundation of contemporary
bourgeois society, under which the most important part of the means of
production and circulation of products, made in the form of commodities, is the
private property of a relatively small class of persons, whereas the majority of
the population cannot subsist except by selling their labour-power. In consequence
of this, they find themselves in the dependent condition of wage-workers
(proletarians) by their labour creating the income of the owners of the means of
production and the circulation of commodities (capitalists and big landowners).


II. The sphere of domination of the capitalist mode of production is expanding,
as the continuous technical progress increases the economic importance of the
big enterprises and thereby decreases the role of independent small producers in
the economic life of society, depressing their living standard, displacing some
into the ranks of the proletariat, and turning others into direct or indirect
vassals and tributaries of capital.

I. Russia’s intensified
involvement in international trade and the
growth of commodity production inside the country
are leading to ever fuller
domination within her of
the capitalist mode of
production, which is distinguished by the following basic features.







II.{5}

Continuous technical progress is increasing the economic importance of the

III. The most important part of the means of production and the circulation of
commodities is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a relatively small
class of persons, whereas an ever growing majority of the population are unable
to maintain their existence otherwise than by selling their labour-power. In
consequence of this, they find themselves in the dependent condition of
wage-workers (proletarians), who by their labour create the income of the owners
of the means of production and the circulation of commodities (capitalists and
big landowners).


IV. fly increasing the productivity of labour, technical progress enables the
capitalists to intensify their exploitation of the workers, engendering a
relative reduction in the demand for labour-power (that is, the increase in

simultaneously with a relative and absolute increase in its supply. This,
together with the above-mentioned basic tendencies of capitalism, leads to a
growth of unemployment, poverty, exploitation, oppression and degradation.


V. The condition of the working class and the small producers is even further
worsened by the industrial crises, which are the inevitable outcome of the said
contradictions of capitalism, by the lack of balanced development of production, which is intrinsic to it (and which no associations of industrialists
can eliminate), and by the growth of rivalry among the capitalist countries on
the world market. Poverty and destitution of the masses exist side by side with
a waste of social wealth in consequence of the impossibility of finding markets
for the commodities produced.

VI. Thus, the gigantic
development of the productive forces of social and
increasingly socialised labour is attended






    

by the monopolisation of all the principal advantages of this development by a
negligible minority of the population, with the growth of social wealth
proceeding side by side with the growth of social inequality, with the gulf
between the propertied and propertyless, between the class of property-owners
(the bourgeoisie) and the class of the proletariat, growing.


VII. But as all these inevitable contradictions of capitalism increase ˜and
develop,






the discontent and indignation of the working class
also grow, and its solidarity increases, in virtue of
the very conditions of the capitalist mode of production,




the number and the solidarity of the proletarians, their
discontent and indignation grow,






the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class becomes sharper
and the urge to throw off the intolerable yoke of capitalism mounts.






VIII. The emancipation
of the workers must be an
act of the working class
itself. If the yoke of capitalism is to be thrown off,
there must be a social revolution, that is,




VIII. The emancipation of
the workers must be an act
of the working class itself,
because all the other classes
of present-day society stand
for the preservation of the
foundations of the existing
economic system.


The real emancipation of
the working class requires a
social revolution, naturally
flowing from the entire development of the capitalist
mode of production, that is,






the abolition of private ownership of the means of production, their conversion
into public property and the replacement of the capitalist production of
commodities by the socialist organisation of the production of commodities by
society as a whole, with the object of ensuring full well-being and free
all-round development for all its members.






IX. To effect this social revolution the proletariat must

    

win political power, which will make it master of the situation and
enable it to remove all obstacles along the road to its great goal. In this
sense the dictatorship of the proletariat is an essential
political condition of the social revolution.


X. The revolution of the proletariat will mean the emancipation of all the
now oppressed and suffering mankind, because it will put an end to all
types of oppression and exploitation of man by man.


XI. Russian Social-Democracy undertakes the task of disclosing to the
workers the irreconcilable antagonism between their interests and those of
the capitalists, of explaining, to the proletariat the historical
significance, nature and prerequisites of the social revolution it will
have to carry out, and of organising a revolutionary class party capable of
directing the struggle of the proletariat in all its forms against the
present social and political system.


XII. But the development of international exchange and of production for
the world market has established (created) such close ties among all the
nations of the civilised (?) world, that the great aim of the proletariat’s
emancipation struggle can be achieved only through the joint efforts of
proletarians in all countries. That is
why{6}

the present-day working-class
movement had to become, and has long since become, an international
movement, and Russian Social-Democracy regards itself as one of the
detachments of the world army of the proletariat, as part of
international Social-Democracy.







    B.
 

I. The immediate aims of Russian Social-Democracy are, however,
considerably modified by the fact that in our country numerous remnants of
the pre-capitalist, serf-owning, social system retard the development of
the productive forces in the highest degree, and lower the working
population’s standard of living; they are responsible for the Asiatically
barbarous way in which the many-million- strong peasantry is dying out, and
keep the entire people

    

in a state of ignorance and subjection, denying them all rights. The Russian
Social-Democrats still have to work for the free civic and political
institutions which already exist in the leading capitalist countries and which
are undoubtedly necessary for the full and all-round development of the
proletariat’s class struggle against the
bourgeoisie.{7}






II. The most outstanding of these remnants of the serf-owning system and the
most formidable bulwark of all that barbarism and all the calamities of which
the politically free countries are already rid, is the tsarist autocracy; it is
the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the proletarian emancipation
movement.




The tsarist autocracy is the most outstanding of these remnants of the
serf-owning system and the most formidable bulwark of all this barbarism. It is
the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the proletarian emancipation movement
and the cultural development of the entire people.






For these reasons Russian Social-Democracy advances as its immediate
political task the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy and its replacement
by a republic based on a democratic constitution that would
ensure:


1) the people’s sovereignty, that is....

lines—abolition of all indirect taxes and establishment of a
progressive income-tax
      

b) in the interests of eradicating all the remnants of the old
serf-owning system



    1) abolition of land redemption and quit-rent payments as well as of
    all services now imposed on the peasantry as a taxable
    social-estate;
  

    2) annulment of collective liability and of all laws restricting the
    peasant in the free disposal of his land;
  

    3) restitution to the people of all amounts taken from them in the
    form of land redemption and quit-rent payments, confiscation for
    this purpose of monasterial property and of the royal
    demesnes,{13} and imposition of a special land tax on members of
    the big landed nobility who received land redemption loans, the
    revenue thus obtained to be credited to a special public fund for
    the cultural and charitable needs of the village communes;
  

    4) establishment of peasant committees

    

    

a) for the restitution to the village communes (by expropriation
or, when the land has changed hands, by redemption, etc.) of the
land cut off from the peasants when serfdom was abolished and
now used by the landlords as a means of keeping the peasants in
bondage;
      

b) for the eradication of the remnants of the serf-owning system
which still exist in the Urals, the Altai, the Western territory
and other regions of the country;
      



    5) empowering of the courts to reduce exorbitant tents and declare
    null and void contracts entailing bondage.
  




The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
believes that the complete, consistent and lasting implementation of the
indicated political and social changes can be achieved only by overthrowing
the autocracy and convoking a constituent assembly, freely elected by the
whole people.

OUTLINES OF THE DRAFT PROGRAMME

VARIANT 1

Commodity production is ever more rapidly developing in Russia, her
participation in international trade is
increasing{8}

and the capitalist mode of
production is becoming increasingly dominant.


A growing majority of the population are unable to maintain their existence
otherwise than by selling their labour-power. In consequence of this they find
themselves in the condition of wage-workers (proletarians) dependent on a
relatively small class of capitalists and big landowners, who hold the most
important part of the means of production and circulation of
commodities.{9}

 

The most important part of the means of production is becoming
concentrated in the hands of an insignificant minority of capitalists and
big landowners as their private property. Ever greater numbers of working
men losing their means of production are forced to resort to the sale of
their labour-power. In this way they find themselves in the dependent
condition of wage-workers (proletarians), who by their labour create the
income of the property-owners.  

The development of capitalism is increasing the number, size and economic
importance of the big enterprises, and is depressing the living standard of the
independent small producers (peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen), turning some
of them into vassals and tributaries of capital and displacing others into the
ranks of the proletariat.


The higher the level of technical progress, the more the growth of the demand
for labour-power lags behind the growth of its supply, and the greater are the
opportunities for the capitalists to intensify exploitation of the workers.





The growth of poverty, unemployment, exploitation, oppression and humiliation is
the result of the basic tendencies of capitalism;




Insecurity of existence, unemployment, the yoke of exploitation and
humiliation of every kind are becoming the lot of ever wider sections of the
working population.





This process is still more aggravated by industrial crises, which are the
inevitable outcome of the said contradictions of capitalism. Poverty and
destitution of the masses exist side by side with a waste of social wealth in
consequence of the im possibility of finding markets for the commodities
produced.


Thus, the gigantic development of the productive forces of social and
increasingly socialised labour is attended by monopolisation of all the
principal advantages of this development by a negligible minority of the
population. The growth of social wealth proceeds side by side with the growth of
social inequality; the gulf between the class of property-owners (the
bourgeoisie) and the class of the proletariat is growing.


(A) § III. Small-scale production is being ousted to an ever greater degree
by large-scale production. The independent small producers (peasants, artisans
and handicraftsmen)

    

are being turned either into proletarians or vassals and tributaries of capital.


As the result of continuous technical progress small-scale production is being
ousted to an ever greater degree by large-scale production. The most important
part of the means of production (of the land and factories, tools and machinery,
railways and other means of communication) is becoming concentrated in the hands
of a relatively insignificant number of capitalists and big landowners as their
private property. The independent small producers (peasants, artisans and
handicraftsmen) are being ruined in growing numbers, losing their means of
production and thus turning into proletarians or else becoming servants and
tributaries of capital. Increasing numbers of working people are compelled to
sell their labour-power.





In this way they become wage-workers who are de pendent on the property-owners
and by their labour create the wealth of the latter.




These wage-workers (proletarians) thus find themselves in a condition of
dependence on the property-owners, and by their labour create the income of the
latter.




VARIANT 2

Commodity production is ever more rapidly developing in Russia, the capitalist
mode of production becoming increasingly dominant.


The most important part of the means of production (of the land and factories,
tools and machinery, railways and other means of communication) is becoming
concentrated in the hands of a relatively insignificant number of capitalists

Increasing numbers of working people losing their means of production are
compelled to sell their labour-power. These wage-workers (proletarians) thus
find themselves in a condition of dependence on the

    

property-owners, and by their labour create the income of the latter.




Increasing numbers of working people are compel led to sell their labour-power
and become wage-workers who are dependent on the property-owners, and by their
labour create the wealth of the latter.





The development of capitalism is increasing the number, size and economic
importance of the big enterprises, is worsening the condition of the independent
small producers (peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen), turning some of them into
vassals and tributaries of capital, and displacing others into the ranks of the
proletariat.


The higher the level of technical progress, the more the growth of the demand
for labour-power lags behind the growth of its supply, and the greater are the
opportunities for the capitalists to intensify exploitation of the
workers. Insecurity of existence and unemployment, the yoke of exploitation, and
humiliation of every kind are becoming the lot of ever wider sections of the

This process is being still more aggravated by industrial crises, which are the
inevitable outcome of the basic contradictions of capitalism. Poverty and

social inequality; the gulf between the class of property-owners (the

“But with a view to eradicating the remnants of the old serf-owning system
It will work for.”


Perhaps we should insert “and in the interests of free development of the
class struggle in the countryside”.


This is prompted by the fact that at this point, too, we must
resolutely draw a line between ourselves and bourgeois democracy,
whose every shade will, of course willingly subscribe to the former
motivation alone.

police and officials” This formulation was proposed by Lenin as an
amendment to the concluding part of the Draft Programme of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party

(see present edition, Vol. 6, p. 33).

The Party Programme adopted by the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in
1903 was worked out by the Editorial Board of Lenin’s Iskra at the
end of 1901 and the first half of 1902. Lenin played an outstanding part in
working out the draft. The preparatory material dates from January-February
1902; it is a reflection of key moments in the working out of the draft
programme by the Iskra Editorial Board: Lenin’s study of the first
draft of Plekhanov’s programme; his work on his own draft of the
theoretical section of the programme and his participation in writing the
collective draft of the practical section of the programme. All materials
are printed from the originals, with variants of para graphs or parts of
paragraphs printed side by side to facilitate comparison. For the
preparatory material for the R.S.D.L.P. Programme see present edition,
Vol. 6, pp. 17–78.

Cut-off lands—lands cut oil from peasants’ allotments in
favour of landowners during the Peasant Reform in Russia in 1861. As a
rule, the peasants were deprived of their best lands, which is why the
cut-off lands were a means used by landowners to enslave the peasants, and
slowed down the elimination of feudal relations in land tenure.

Royal demesnes are lands which belonged to the royal family.

“4. establishment of peasant committees:



      a) for the restitution to the village communes (by expropriation
      or, when the land has changed hands,by redemption, etc.) of the
      land cut off from the peasants when serfdom was abolished and now
      used by the landlords as a means of keeping the peasants in
      bondage....”{1}








    Plekhanov. NB. Please note this: expropriation
    (No. 3) does not rule out redemption; redemption
    does not rule out expropriation (proof superfluous);
    “redemption, etc.”  (No. 2) is nothing but redemption—“etc.”
    should be deleted. The words in brackets could be replaced by these
    (by redemption, if after 1861 the land [and not lands] (No. 1) has
    changed hands by sale). This will make it clear that in other cases
    restitution shall take place without compen sation for the present
    owners. Where the land has changed hands by inheritance, or
    donation, or exchange, there should be no
    redemption. I think we shall have time to alter this.
  

    Axelrod. I agree. P.A.
  



    No. 1. Once you have “lands” in the programme it is bad grammar to
    say “land” in brackets.
  

    No. 2. “etc.” includes exchange of lands, and servi tude for land,
    and redemarca tion, etc. It would therefore be quite wrong
    to delete it.
  

    No. 3. “Expropriation” nor mally implies deprivation of
    property, that is, taking away without compensation. So it is not
    all that strange to contrast it with redemp tion as it may appear to
    the author of the remarks.
  





“It is our duty to fight against all remnants of serf-owning
relationships—that is beyond doubt to a Social-Demo crat—and since
these relationships are most intricately interwoven with bourgeois
relationships, we are obliged to penetrate into the very core, if I may
use the word, of this confusion, undeterred by the complexity of the
task.”{2}






P l e k h  a n o v.

There is no
need to ask for permission to
obtain knowledge of the core.



? ?





“...the workers’ section contains demands directed against the
bourgeoisie, whereas the peasants’ section contains demands directed
against the serf-owning landlords (against the feudal lords, I would
say, if the applicability of this term to our landed nobility were not so



disputable1)).



1) Personally I am inclined to decide this question in the
affirmative, but in
the given instance, it is of course neither the place nor the time for
substantiating or even for proposing this solution, since what we are concerned
with now is defence of the draft agrarian programme prepared collectively by
the entire Editorial
Board.”{3}





 

Axelrod. NB. I do think that such hints at differences could be waived in a
programme pamphlet.








“However, to try to determine in advance, before the final outcome of the
struggle, in the course of that struggle, that we shall perhaps fail to
achieve the entire maximum, means lapsing into sheer
=

philistinism.”{4}







P l e k h a n o v.

“Try to determine” that we shall fail to achieve the
entire maximum, etc.—that is very ineptly phrased.
I
propose to substitute for it the phrase
I wrote in the
text.{5}

I request a vote on this proposal. Motive: fear of gibes from
opponents.


I also propose a vote on my proposal to delete the
author’s considerations about Russian feudalism. Motive: such
reasoning is irrelevant in a general, you might say, editorial,
article. The author’s reservations merely suggest a difference ol
opinion on the Editorial Board.


A x e l r o d.

I already spoke out in this vein above.




A bit of tact would suggest to the author of the remarks that it is highly
improper to insist on a vote of the stylistic changes he
proposes (perhaps for the worse?). It is equally ridiculous to fear that over
the minor question of “feudal ism” (the Martynovs?) will raise a cry
about a “difference of opinion”. My statement was a very general
one.






“‘Ourmovement’ is the Social-Democratic labour movement. The peasant
masses cannot just be ‘brought’ into it:
that is not problematic, but impossible, and there was never any
question of it. However, the peasant masses cannot but be brought into
the ‘movement’ against all the remnants of the serf-owning system (including the
=

autocracy).”{6}






Plekhanov. I propose that
instead of the words: “peasant masses (in the phrase about
“bringing in”) we write: the

    

peasant mass as such, i.e., as an estate, and, moreover, regard ed
as a single whole, etc.


I request a vote on this.


Axelrod. I agree. P.A.




See 28 reverse.{7}






“We must spread the idea far and wide that only in a republic can the
decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie take place; we must
create and consolidate republican traditions among all the Russian
revolutionaries and among the broadest possible masses of Russian Workers; we
should express through this “republic” slogan that we will carry to
the end the struggle to dernocratise the state system, without looking
back.”{8}






P l e k h a n o v.

I advise the deletion of the words: we must spread the idea that only
in a republic can the decisive battle between the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie take place (I request a vote on this). I am not at all sure
that in Britain, say, political development must go through a republic. The monarchy there will hardly be a hindrance to the workers, so that its removal may
turn out to be a result instead of a preliminary condition of
the triumph of socialism.


A x e l r o d.

In favour of the proposal. P.A.




The example of Britain is not very apt because of her exceptional position. To
compare Russia with Britain just now is to sow great confusion among
the public. The “necessity” of a republic is indicated by the
remarks of Marx (1875) and Engels (1891) concerning the demand for a republic in
Germany{34}—but there can always be exceptions.






“Hence, for the sake of simplicity, the entire content of Clause 4 may be
briefly expressed as ’restitution of the cut-off lands’. The question arises:
how did the idea of this demand originate? It arose as the direct outcome of the
general and fundamental proposition that we must assist the peasants and urge
them to destroy all remnants of the serf-owning system as completely as
possible. This meets with ’general approval’, doesn’t it? Well then, if
you do agree to follow this road, make an effort to proceed along it
independently; don’t make it necessary to drag you; don’t let the
’unusual’ appearance of this road frighten you;

    

don’t be put out by the fact that in many places you will find no beaten
track at all, and that you will have to crawl along the edge of precipices,
break your way through thickets, and leap across chasms. Don’t complain of
the poor road: these complaints will be futile whining, for you should have
known in advance that you would be moving, not along a highway that has been
graded and levelled by all the forces of social progress, but along paths,
through out-of-the-way places and back-alleys which do have a way out, but from
which you, we or anyone else will never find a direct, simple, and easy way
out—’never’, i.e., whilst these disappearing, but so slowly disappearing,
out-of-the-way places and back-alleys continue to exist.


“But if you do not want to stray into these back-alleys, then say so
frankly and don’t try to get away by
phrase-mongering.”{9}






P l e k h a n o v.

I put to the vote the question of crossing out this page. It lends a
somewhat feuilleton character to the reasoning, which in itself is clear and
consistent. In order to put forward the demand for restitution of the cut-off
lands, there is no need “to crawl along the edge of precipices”,
etc. This imagery suggests that the author himself has not quite tied in the
“cut-off lands” with his own orthodoxy.


A x e l r o d.

I propose we leave out this page, starting from the words: “This
meets...” to the end of the following page
(47). P.A.




I put to the vote the question of whether it is proper to use such
canaan-toned remarks in respect of a colleague. And where is it going
to get us if we

a l l

start cudgelling each other in that way??






“Direct survivals of the corvée system, recorded times without
number in
all the economic surveys of Russia, are maintained, not by any special law which
protects them, but by the actually existing land relationships. This is so to
such an extent that witnesses testifying before the well-known Valuyev
=

Commission{35} openly stated that serf-ownership would undoubtedly
have been revived had it not

    

been directly prohibited by law. Hence, one of two things:
either you refrain altogether from touching upon the land relationships between
the peasants and the landlords—in which case all the remaining questions
are solved very ’simply’, but then you will also be ignoring the main source of
all the survivals of the serf-owning economy in the country side, and will
’simply’ be avoiding a burning question bearing on the most vital interests of
the feudal landlords and the enslaved peasantry, a question which tomorrow or
the day after may easily become one of the most pressing social and political
issues in Russia. Or else you want also to touch upon the source of the
’obsolete forms of economic bondage’ represented by the land
relationships—in which case you must reckon with the fact that these
relationships are so complex and entangled that they do not actually permit of
any easy or simple solution. Then, if you are not satisfied with the concrete
solutiQn we have proposed for this complex question, you no longer have the
right to get away with a general ’complaint’ about its complexity, but
must attempt to cope with it independently, and propose some other
concrete solution.


“The importance of the cut-off lands in present-day peasant farming is a
question of
reality.”{10}






P l e k  h a n o v.

I would advise throwing out all the reasoning about
“simplicity” and “non simplicity”, and continuing the
article with the words: “The imporrtance of the cut-off lands....”
The article will gain therefrom, because this whole passage spoils it by


being terribly (??)

dragged out. I propose a vote.




The reasoning about simplicity, as a summing up of the foregoing (and as a
reply to a host of remarks made by those even who sympathise with
us), is not at all superfluous, and I suggest we leave it in.






“Labour rent makes for stagnation in cultivation techniques and for
stagnation in all social and economic relation ships in the
countryside, since this labour rent hampers the development of a money economy
and the differentiation of the peasantry, disembarrasses the landlord
(comparatively) of the stimulus of competition (instead of raising the
technical level, he reduces the share of the sharecropper; incidentally,

    

this reduction has been recorded in a number of localities for many years
of the post-Reform period), ties the peasant to the land, thereby checking
the progress of migration, outside employment,
etc."{11}






P l e k h a n o v.

I propose to delete the words: “and the differ
entiation of the peasantry”; they could


bias the reader against
a measure which in itself merits every approval. If you insist on leaving these
words in, elaborate on them, explaining (even if only in a footnote) what you
mean by them. I request a vote.




How? Whom? Why?—this baffles all understanding.






Furthermore: what means “comparatively disembarrasses”? The word
“comparatively” does not fit in here.




It’s quite plain. It means:
it disembarrasses relative to the current state in Russia (and not
as compared with, say, America).






“And in general: once it is generally acknowledged that the cut-off lands
are one of the principal roots of the labour-rent system—and this system
is a direct survival of serf-ownership which retards the development of
capitalism—how can one doubt that the restitution of the cut-off lands
will undermine the labour-rent system and accelerate social and economic
=

progress?”{12}






P l e k h a n o v.

That is just why there is no need to go to such lengths to prove this.




A hasty conclusion. See end of this (55) and beginning of the next
page.{13}






“As far as I can judge, all objections ’against the cut-off lands’
fit into one or another of these four groups; moreover, most of the objectors
(including Martynov) have answered all four questions in the negative,
considering the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands wrong in
principle, politically inexpedient, practically unattainable, and logically
=

inconsistent.”{14}





 

P l e k h a n o v.

I propose that Martynov should be deleted: there’s much too much of him
stuck in all over the place.  

A x e l r o d.

Indeed, des Gu-
ten, i.e., Martynov, mehr als
zu
viel.{15}

P.A.




See p. 28
reverse.{16}


Martynov has cited argu-
ments reiterated by very
many of our friends. It
would be highly tactless to
let these arguments go, with out replying to them, and to refrain from
mentioning Martynov, when he speaks to the point.






“And we shall not be in the least contradicting ourselves if we delete from
our programme the struggle against the remnants of the serf-owning system in the
subsequent historical period when the special features of the present social and
political ‘juncture’ will have disappeared, when the peasants, let us suppose,
will have been satisfied by insignificant concessions made to an insignificant
number of property-owners and begin definitely to ’snarl’ at the
proletariat. Then, we shall probably also have to delete from our programme the
struggle against the autocracy, for it is quite inconceivable that the peasants
will succeed in ridding themselves of the most repulsive and grievous form of
feudal oppression before political liberty has been
attained.”{17}






P l e k h a n o v.

I propose we throw out the part starting with the
words: “And we shall not be...” and ending with: ’%..has been
attained.” Instead of reinforcing, they weaken the
conviction carried by the foregoing.


A x e l r o d.

In favour. P.A.




These words should stand, for they arise out of a necessary
precaution. Other wise, we could later be very well accused of lack of
foresight.






“It may be argued: ’However slowly the labour-rent farming may be yielding
to the pressure of capitalism, still it is yielding; it is, moreover, doomed to
disappear complete ly; large-scale labour-rent farming is giving way to, and

    

will be directly replaced by, large-scale capitalist farming. What you want is
to accelerate the elimination of serf-owning by a measure which in essence
amounts to the splitting-up (partial, but nevertheless splitting-up) of
large-scale farms. Are you not thereby sacrificing the interests of the future
to the interests of the present? For the sake of the problematic possibility of
a peasant revolt against serf-owning in the immediate future, you are placing
obstacles in the way of a revolt of the agricultural proletariat against
capitalism in the more or less distant future!’


“This argument, however convincing it may seem at first glance, is very
=

one-sided....”{18}






P l e k h a n o v.

It’s pretty unconvincing even at first glance. It reeks of such wild
pedantry, that the least said of it the better: I blush for the
Social-Democrats. This sense of shame is the stronger now that thousands of
Russian
peasants are rising up to liquidate the old order. I request a vote on
the proposal to declare this argument unconvincing even at first glance.


A x e l r o d.

I believe we should throw out the compliment to our opponents à la
Martynov.
P.A.




I think it is ridiculous to see this as a “compliment to our
opponents”, when they are being refuted (this is even actually wrong,
because the argument was repeated in their letters by Iskra’s
closest friends). Besides, there’s no point at all in the abuse
heaped on them by the author of the remarks.






“....this could not fail to exert the profoundest influence on
the spirit of protest and the independent struggle of the entire rural
working
population”.{19}






P l e k h a n o v.

What does “independent struggle” mean?




See Belgium in April
1902.{36} She provides the answer to this “difficult” question.






“And in order to facilitate for our farm labourers and semi-farm labourers
the subsequent transition to socialism, it is highly important that the
socialist party begin to
‘stand up’ at once for the small peasants, and do ‘everything
possible’ for them, never refusing a hand in solving the

    

urgent and complex ‘alien’ (non-proletarian) problems, and helping the
working and exploited masses to regard the socialist party as their leader
and
representative.”{20}






P l e k h a n o v.

Why are the words “everything possible” in
inverted commas (“quotes”)? I don’t understand. Besides, the
question of “semi-farm labourers” is not at all an alien one
for the proletariat. It is now extremely bad policy to use this word,
even in quotes.




Is it so hard to understand that everyone has his own way of using quotes?
Perhaps the author of the remarks will want to

“v o t e”

on the quotes as well? I shouldn’t be at all surprised!






“It is the Russian bourgeoisie who were ‘late’ with what is really
their task of sweeping away all the remnants of the old regime, and we
must and shall rectify this omission until it has been rectified, until we have
won political liberty, as long as the position of the peasants continues to
foster dissatisfaction among practically the whole of educated bourgeois society
(as is the case in Russia), instead of fostering a feeling of conservative
self-satisfaction among it on account of the ’indestructibility’ of what is
supposed to be the strongest bulwark against socialism (as is the dase in the
West where this self-satisfaction is displayed by all the parties of Order,
ranging from the agrarians and conservatives pur sang, through the liberal and
free-thinking bourgeois, to even as far—without offence to Messrs. the
Chernovs and the Vestnik Russkoi
Revolutsii!{37}—to even
as far as the fashionable ‘critics of Marxism’ in the agrarian
=

question).”{21}






P l e k h a n o v.

I strongly advise that we throw out here the words
“Vesinik Rueskot Revolutsii”. They stand alongside
Chernov’s name, and we could be accused of carelessly bringing the two
together, giving a hint, and almost divulging a pseudonym. This should be
avoided at all costs.




I agree, but I prefer to throw out “the Chernovs”.






“Nationalisation of the land is a different matter. This demand (if it is
interpreted in the bourgeois sense, and not

    

in the socialist) does actually ’go further’ than the demand for the
restitution of the cut-off lands, and in principle we fully endorse it. It
goes without saying that, when the revolutionary moment comes, we shall not
fail to advance
it.”{22}






P l e k h a n o v.

I quite ad here to this
remark.{38} That’s the
“crux” of the matter.


A x e l r o d.

I don’t quite understand. Above you gave an excellent definition
of the social-revolutionary character of the agrarian programme; besides,
nationalisation of the land is now anti-revolutionary even as a slogan for an
uprising. I agree with Berg’s proposal.




It’s a pity the “adherent” quite forgot that the remark related to
the unedited article. Just a little attention would have spared him
this amusing mistake.






“But our present programme is being drawn up, not only for the period of
revolutionary insurrection, not even so much for that period, as for the period
of political slavery, for the period that precedes political liberty. However,
in this period the demand for the nationalisation of the land is much
less expressive of the immediate tasks of the democratic movement in the
meaning of a struggle against the serf-owning
system.”{23}






P l e k h a n o v.

The point made above was that our agrarian programme is a
social-revolutionary one.


Nationalisation of the land in a police state would mean a fresh and vast
increase of that state. That is why it is not right to say, as the author says
here, “much less expressive”, etc. One measure is
revolutionary and the other reactionary.








A x e l r o d.

Plekhanov’s proposal coincides with the meaning of
Berg’s remarks, and mine on the preceding page.




This is wrong. Nationalisation is not always “reactionary”,
regardless of time and character. That’s an absurdity.


If the authors of the remarks refuse to take the

    

trouble to give a precise formulation to the amendments, even in a
second reading (although this demand was specially accepted and
communicated to all)—there will he endless delays through votes on
“changes” in general (and then on the text of the changes??). It
would be better to worry less about the author of a signed article
expressing himself in his own manner.






“That is why we think that, on the basis of the present social system, the
maximum demand in our agrarian programme should not go beyond the democratic
revision of the Peasant Reform. The demand for nationalisation of the land,
while quite valid in principle and quite suitable at certain moments, is
politically inexpedient at the present
moment.”{24}






P l e k h a n o v.

I agree with Berg’s
remark.{39}
But I propose
this wording: in a police state, nationalisation of the land is harmful,
and in a constitutional one it will be a part of the demand for the
nationalisation of all the means of production.
I request a vote.


A x e l r o d.

I agree. P.A.




See p. 75
reverse.{25}






“Such composition of the courts would be a guarantee both of their
democratic nature and free expression of the different class interests of the
various sections of the rural
population.”{26}






P l e k h a n o v.

The style
here is terrible. I propose a vote
on improving It.


A x e l r o d.

How?




A “terrible” concept of the “voting” game! It looks as if
we have nothing better to do!





 

“...it is well known that in our countryside rent is more often of a serf-owning
than a bourgeois nature; it is much more “money” rent (i.e., a
modified form of feudal rent) than capitalist rent (i.e., the surplus over and
above the profit of the employer). Reductions of rent would therefore directly
help to replace serf-owning forms of farming by capitalist
forms.”{27}






P l e k h a n o v.

The author romisedn otto speak of Russian eudaism (see above), but
has failed to keep his promise. That’s a pity. I request a vote
on the proposal to delete here the word feudal (rent).




That’s not true. If you do take a look above, you will find that
the author “promised” nothing of the sort. Once the author has made
the specific reservation that this is not a general opinion, the
quibbling here is doubly tactless.






“Even the autocracy has therefore been obliged more and more frequently to
institute a special fund (utterly trifling, of course, and going more to line
the pockets of embezzlers of state property and bureaucrats than for the relief
of the famine-stricken) ’for the cultural and charitable needs of the village
communes’. We, too, cannot but demand, among other democratic reforms, that such
a fund be established. That can scarcely be
disputed.”{28}






P l e k h a n o v.

This passage here about the “autocracy” is
extremely inappropriate. After all, why should we look to It for
example? As if we are unable to make any proposals without looking to it for a
cue?


The restitution to the peasants should be motivated by it being a revolutionary
measure, rectifying an “injustice” which is not only still
in everyone’s mind, but which largely served to ruin the Russian peasant
(cf. Martynov).


P.S. When the French émigrés demanded their billion (at

    

the time of the
Restoration){40} they said nothing about charity. They
had a better understanding of the class struggle.


I propose a vote on the pro-
posal to
rewrite this passage.


A x e l r o d.

Cf. Plekhanov’s remark to
p. 90{41} Read that and these remarks carefully
and you will agree with them. P.A.




That

e v e n

the autocracy has been obliged to go in for charity (in
the small. est way) is

a  f a c t,

fear of reference to which is rather
strange. That this is put forward as an “example”, is a “poor
invention” by a man who wants to quibble.






“But, then—the objection
is raised—this tribute cannot
be returned in full. Quite so
(just as the cut-off lands cannot be restituted in
full).”{29}






P l e k h a n o v.

Why can’t the cut-off lands be restituted in full? The programme says
nothing about it.


I call everyone’s attention to the fact that the meaning of the paragraph
we adopted has been changed here.


A x e l r o d.

Why do you restrict and weaken a principled decision by an insertion?




That’s absolutely wrong. Lenin’s insertion in his article does not
alter the meaning of what the programme says, and

c a n n o t

do
so. The author of the remarks has forgotten the elementary truth that “it
is the law, and not the motives of the law, that is subject to application”.






“Actually, of course, the annulment of collective liability (Mr. Witte may
manage to put this particular reform through before the revolution), the
abolition of division into social-estates, freedom of movement, and the right
for each individual peasant freely to dispose of his land will rapidly and
inevitably bring about the removal of the burden of taxation and serf-bondage
that the land commune to a three-fourths extent constitutes at the present
time. But this result will only prove the correctness of our views on the
village commune, prove how incompatible it is with the entire social and
economic development of
capitalism.”{30}






P l e k h a n o v.

There is now talk of its destruction. The relevant phrase should therefore
be changed.




“Therefore” has nothing to do with it. The “talk” has been going on for
quite some

    

time, and even if it does lead to some action, still nothing need be
altered there.






I propose that instead of “capitalism” we say: “with all the social and
economic development of our time”. Motive: this will spare us any
“demagogic criticism” by the proponents of the commune.




I find this fear of “demagogy” absolutely unwarranted, because
these gentlemen will always come up with similarly “bad criticism”.






“To this we reply that it does not at all follow from our formulation that
every peasant must necessarily demand that a separate plot of land be allotted
to him. What does follow is only liberty to sell the land; moreover, the
preferential right of the commune members to purchase land that is being
sold does
not run counter to this
liberty.”{31}






P l e k h a n o v.

I quite agree with this
remark,{42} and propose that it be put to the vote.


A x e l r o d.

In favour.




“I agree” with what related to a deleted passage??!!?? A very fine
proposal for a “vote”, indeed!






“This objection would be groundless. Our demands do not destroy the
association but, on the contrary, set up in place of the archaic (de facto
semi-feudal) power of the commune over the muzhik, the power of a
modern association over its members who join of their own accord. Nor,
in particular, is our formulation at variance with the recognition, f or
instance, of fellow members’ having the pre-emptive right, on certain terms, to
buy the land put up for sale by a fellow member.”






P l e k h a n o v.

I don’t agree with this. This right would merely depreciate the peasant’s
land.


As for collective liability, it has artially already been abol iso ,and the
rest will be abolished by Mr. Witte any day now.


Contradiction. I fail to under stand: on the one hand, I
freely enter an association and freely withdraw from
it. On the other,

    

the commune has a pre-emptive right to buy my land. There’s a
contradiction in this.




The author of the remarks overdoes his hostility to the commune. On this point
great care must be taken to keep out of the embrace of Messrs. A. Skvortsov
& Co. (into which the author of the remarks falls). On certain
terms, the right of preemption may increase instead



of decreasing the value of the land. My expression is deliberately broader and
more general, whereas the author of the remarks is in too much of a hurry to cut
the Gordian knot. By carelessly “denying” the commune (as an
association) we may easily spoil all our “good will” to the
peasant. After all, the commune is also connect ed with the conventional type of
settlement, and so on, and only the A. Skvortsovs “remake”
this in their projects with the stroke of a pen.






“To clear the way for the free development of the class struggle in the
countryside, it is necessary to remove all remnants of serfdom, which now
overlie the beginnings of capitalist antagonisms among the rural
population, and keep them from
developing.”{32}






P l e k h a n o v.

This is the
first time I see the word antagonism used in the plural.




The author of the remarks should not imagine that he is past seeing
anything for the first time.





 *     *  * 




This alone is made fully clear by the remarks of the “author of the
remarks”. If he set himself the task of making it
i m p o s s i b l e for comrades who disagree with him, even on trifling
matters, to work together with him on the board, he is rapidly and very surely
moving towards that noble goal. But if he does reach it, he himself should bear
the consequences.


(1) The remarks are written in such a careless manner that no effort has even
been made to compare what there was before and what there is after the
corrections.

 

(2) In fact, the list of corrections has simply been thrown out!
“Don’t buck me.


(3) Hardly any of the alterations proposed by the author of the remarks
has been formulated by him personally—contrary to the spec if ted
con d i t i o n adopted of necessity to avoid intolerable delays.


(4) The tone of the remarks is deliberately abusive. If I adopted such a tone in
“analysing” Plekhanov’s article on the programme (i.e.,
his personal “a r t I c ˜! C and not the draft of a general
statement, a general programme, etc.) that would at once be the end of our
collaboration. And so I “put to the vote”: are members of the
board to be allowed to provoke other members into doing so?


(5) It is the summit of tactlessness to use ii o .t i n g a to
interfere in the very manner in which the members of the board express
themselves.


The author of the remarks puts me in mind of a coachman who thinks that to steer
well, the horses have to be reined in and brought up as often and as hard as
possible. Of course, I am nothing more than a horse, one of the horses
of the coachman—Plekhanov—but even the most harassed horse may throw
off the much too spirited coachman.

G. V. Plekhanov’s and P. B. Axelrod’s remarks on Lenin’s article “The
Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” were written on the back
of the original between April 20 and May 1 (May 3 and 14), 1902. Lenin’s
replies were also written on the back of the original on May 1 (14), 1902,
at the same time as his letter to Plekhanov (see present edition, Vol. 34,
p. 103); the concluding part of Lenin’s replies (pp. 68–69) was written on

   

separate sheets appended to the original of the article. Each of the
replies was preceded by an extract from the article to which the remarks
referred. Lenin used thin lines to underscore Plekhanov’s text.

A general strike in support of the demand for universal suffrage put
forward in Parliament by representatives of the Labour, and Democratic
parties. The strike involved over 300,000 workers, who staged
demonstrations throughout the country. However, when Parliament rejected
the Bill and troops fired on the demonstrators, the opportunist leadership
of the Labour Party (Vandervelde and others) capitulated and, under the
pressure of their “allies” from the cam p of the liberal bourgeoisie,
called off the general strike. The defeat of the working class in Belgium
in April 1902 was a lesson for the working-class movement of the world.

A reference to the following remark by L. Martov at the Zurich
conference of the Iskra Editorial Board on April 2 (15), 1902:

émigrés whose lands were confiscated and sold as national
property during the French bourgeois revolution at the end of the

   

eighteenth century. The law on compensation adopted on March 27, 1825,
provided for pecuniary rewards totalling 1,091,360,000 francs (the
“émigré billion”). Members of the royal retinue got the
biggest rewards. To obtain this vast sum of money, the government increased
taxes and converted the 5 per cent state rent to 3 per cent.

p. 66





{41}

A reference to Plekhanov’s remark on the following part of the article:
“But why confine oneself to this source? Why not try, in addition, to
return to the people at least part of the tribute which yesterday’s
slave-owners extracted, and are still extracting, from the peasants with
the assistance of the police state?” (See present edition, Vol. 6,
p. 144.) Plekhanov wrote: “That is the only thing that should be proposed,
and not charity. Only those who received the amounts can be expected to
return them: the gentry.”

p. 66





{42}

A reference to the following remark by L. Martov: “This proposition is
wrong. Freedom to demand a separate plot flows precisely from the
freedom to dispose of the land. It is enough to point out instead that the
transformation of the power of the commune over the individual into the
power of an association over the member who joins on his own accord is not
ruled out by our demands.”  

After the Zurich conference, Lenin crossed out both sentences in the
original and wrote instead: “This objection would be ground less” ending
with “put up for sale by a fellow member”

(p. 67).

We give in full the splendid proclamation issued by the Don
Committee of our Party. It shows that the Social-Democrats
know hoxv to appreciate the heroic behavipur of men like Balmashev, without,
however, falling into the error of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries.{2} The
Social-Democrats bring to the fore the workers’ (and peasants’) movement. They
make their demands on the government on behalf of the Working class and the
whole people, but without issuing any threats of further attempts and
assassinations. They

    

regard terrorism as one of the possible ancillary means, and not as a
special tactical method justifying separation from revolutionary
Social-Democracy.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The leaflet of the Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. “To the Citizens of
Russia”, issued on May 9 (22), 1902, was circulated among workers in a
total of 2,000 copies. It said that the blood of Balmashev, who had been
sentenced to death by a military tribunal for the assassination of Minister
Sipyagin,

“will wash the eyes of the blinded philistines and make them see the
indescribable horror of the autocracy in Russia. Let them see that our
struggle against it is growing and spreading. Masses of peasants are
already coming to the assistance of the workers and a handful of
unhypocritical intellectuals. The first signs are already in evidence: in
Tula the soldiers have refused to shoot at the strikers; a peasant uprising
has broken out in Poltava and Kharkov gubernias. For centuries the muzhik
there had been working for the benefit of his lord, for centuries he had
suffered oppression and privation, and his patience has finally come to an
end.”

The tsarist government hastened to the rescue of the landowners and started
fierce reprisals. The leaflet went on: “We have had enough of this slavish
and ignominious forbearance, we have had enough of sacrifice.... Citizens!
Stem the endless tide of this horrible blood letting! Overthrow the
autocracy!”

p. 69





{2}

Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.R.s)—a petty-bourgeois
party in Russia which originated at the end of 1901 and the beginning of
1902 from the merger of various Narodnik groups and circles (the Union of
Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries,
etc.). The views of the S.R.s were a jumble of Narodnik and revisionist
ideas; they tried, as Lenin put it,

   

to “patch up the rents in the Narodnik ideas with bits of fashionable
opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism” (see present edition, Vol. 9,
p. 310). During the First World War, most of the S.R.s took a
social-chauvinist stand.  

After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, the S.R.s
and the Mensheviks were the mainstay of the counter revolutionary bourgeois
and landowner Provisional Government, while the party’s leaders
(Avksentyev, Kerensky and Chernov) were in the government.  

At the end of November 1917, the Left wing of the S.R.s formed an
independent party of Left S.R.s. In an effort to retain their influence
among the peasants, the Left S.R.s gave nominal recognition to the Soviet
power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but soon began to
fight against the Soviets.  

During the foreign armed intervention and the Civil War, the S.R.s were
engaged in counter-revolutionary subversive activity, giving active support
to the interventionists and whiteguards, taking part in
counter-revolutionary plots and organising terroristic acts against the
leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party. After the Civil War,
the S.R.s continued their hostile activity inside the country and among the
whiteguard émigré.

The leaflet of the Don Committee, which we reprint, sums up some remarkable
events and gives them a highly correct and striking assessment, drawing
practical conclusions which Social-Democrats will never tire of repeating. It
was published in 6,500 copies and sent to various towns of Russia in December.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The leaflet “To the Citizens of All Russia” was issued by
the Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in November 1902 in connection with the
strike in Rostov from November 2 to 25 (November 15-December 8).  

It refuted the official report in Pravitelstvenny Vestnik
(Government Herald) about the Rostov events, which described the workers as
an “unruly crowd” with crude demands allegedly of an exclusively economic
character. The leaflet gave a true picture of the strike, which was
expressly political, and described the fierce reprisals of the tsarist
troops against the workers and their families. It called on the workers to
respond with revolutionary action to the violence of the tsarist
government. The leaflet ended with these words: 

“Let the fire that has flared up on the Don spread in a terrible
conflagration, let the rifle salvoes be echoed by mighty demonstrations,
let the groans of the victims be amplified by thunderous protest, let
citizens everywhere, as unanimously as in Rostov, pass the death sentence
on the autocracy, which is oppressing the country!  

“Down with the autocracy!  

“Long live the coming revolution!”  

The leaflet was published in Iskra No. 31 on January 1, 1903,
with an editorial introduction by Lenin, and was also issued in a special
reprint.  

On the copy of the leaflet received by the Iskra Editorial
Board, there is also the following in Lenin’s hand: “Set up

i n

b r e v i e r

right away and issue in a special reprint: Special impression from
No. 31 of ‘Iskra’\thinspace”, together with a calculation of
the number of letters and instructions to the type-setters.

The war is on. It is just beginning. Literary polemics.

9. Σ = total lack of principle. Anyone who wants to, can be a
Socialist-Revolutionary.


10. Complete detachment from international socialism:
“distinctive character”.




B) Middle-of-the-road and unprincipled stand between Russian Marxism
  and the
  Narodnaya Volya trend, rather: the liberal-Narodnik trend.



1.
    

The new revolutionary movement goes hand in hand with a struggle between the
old theory and the new. Relics of Russian socialism (liberal-Narodnik trend)
and Russian Marxism. What is the attitude of the Socialist-Revolutionaries?
The Eve of Revolution is typical. (Total incomprehension of the
importance of theoretical discussions.)
    

Degeneration of the old Russian socialism into a liberal-Narodnik trend.
    


2.


 “Labour economy” (S.R. theory) (from Revolutsionnaya

4.


Σ=purely eclectic combination of Narodism and Marxism with the aid
of “criticism”.





C)
Middle-of-the-road attitude to the class struggle and the
working-class movement.



1.
From the theoretical errors of their stand they pass on to practical ones. Their
attitude to the class struggle and the working-class
movement. What is their approach?


2.
Quotation from Vestrdk Russkoi Revolutsii No. 2,
p. 224. Party and class. Confusion, which means only one
thing: moving away from the proletariat’s class struggle and throwing open
the door to an intelligentsia that is absolutely uncommitted and unstable.


3.
Intelligentsia + proletariat + peasantry (No. 8, p. 6, column 2)
(against “narrow” orthodoxy). Meaning=total denial of the class
struggle. Confusion of different strata. Lumping together of
intelligentsia’s social reformism and a revolutionarism which is

    

merely democratic—and proletarian socialism—and crude peasant
demands.



4. Intelligentsia and proletariat. And the Narodnaya Volya
followers as well!!! Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii
No. 3—pp. 9–11.

S p e c i a l

s h e e t.


5. Their attitude in practice? Illustrated by
Economism.{8}
Iskra: long process of work, persuasion,
education. Iskra’s shedding of illusions about unity.
Cf.: Gloating



+ Putting spokes in revolutionary Marxism’s
wheels.


Σ =  dilettante on the sidelines.


6. How they explain their distinction from the Social-Democrats? No. 9, p. 4,
column 2.


{

The point is not that “they want to be”, but that the

w o r k i n g - c l a s s

m o v e m e n t

is there.

 Labour in general is an absurdity.


{

Failure to make a distinction between hired and independent
labour=vulgarisation of socialism by petty-bourgeois element and total
obliteration of division from the Narodniks.


“A purely ideological representative” of a principle. No
principle at all!




D) Regardless of their wilt, they are leading the working class towards
subordination to bourgeois democracy.



1. We have examined the theoreticaistand of the S.R.s and their attitude to the
working-class movement.


Σ = middle-of-the-road stand, eclecticism.


Their attitude to Russian bourgeois democracy.


2. There is none! Vestnik

Russkoi Revolutsii No. 2, Cf. “Modern Vestal
p. 132!! The S.R.s already
Virgin”.{9}
 noticed this during the war


against the Economists.


3. What about Mr. Struve? What about the liberal Narodnik trend? That’s to
whom they give in!!! It means that they give in to bourgeois democracy,
failing to explain to the workers the class antitheses, and failing to work
out an independent socialist ideology.


    

4. What means intelligentsia + proletariat + peasantry? In
practice, the intelligentsia and the peasantry
constitute nothing more than bourgeois democracy!!


5. What about their attitude to the liberals? Have



another look at the + and - of capitalism formula (No. 9, p. 4).

    



There is no class under lying the liberals (No. 9,
    p. 4).
  

    There is much more of it than you have!
  

    Our fight against the liberals is much more acute than yours
    is.
  



    Curious fact: they took the liberals at their
      word!!  No. 9, pp. 3–4.  (V. V.’s variants)
  




We are engaged in a

w a r

and not in verbose reasoning: on the one hand, on the other hand.


But we realise that the liberals represent a class,
that they are resilient, and they have a

s o c i a l,

p o p u l a r
movement, which the S.R.s have not!!



6. L.M. in Zarya (No. 2–3) was right: the S.R.s have a
twofold name because their socialism is not at all revolutionary and their
revolutionism has nothing in common with socialism. That is what leads to
their defeats by bourgeois democracy.

    


That is the end of the principled criticism of the whole
S.R. stand. Let us note that we reject the whole of their stand and
not merely their errors in the (agrarian) programme, not
merely their errors in tactics (terrorism).


Warning against
petty-bourgeois
socialism,
revolutionarism and
vacillation.







E)

A g r a r i a n

q u e s t i o n.



1.

    


Primitive vulgar socialism. Credulity. No analysis of the movement. Failure
to understand the struggle against the remnants

    

of serfdom (No. 8, p. 4: the 1861 reforms have given scope to
capitalism!!).

call by the Peasant Union, etc. Indeed you are less prepared than the
Social-Democrats!




2. The peasantry’s “equalitarian principle”, etc., is merely labouring
under a delusion of democratic demands. There is nothing socialist
in it. You must tell the truth instead of stooping to demagogy.

 
 



1) The modern countryside can support and intensify the pressure
on the government “and can probably do it more vigorously than we think,
cut off as we have absolutely been in most cases from the muzhik for
several years now because of government spying and
oppression”. Revolutsionnaya Rossiya No. 4 (February 1902), p. 2.




3. “Socialisation of the land.” Bourgeois nationalisa tion? (What about
its significance in a class state?) “Socialisation of the land” is an
empty promise (minimum!).


After all this = de facto

“t h e

of the Narodnaya Volya.


4. Co-operation (instead of the class struggle!) is a purely
(bourgeois-) petty-bourgeois demand.


5. For the commune. Against free disposal.


6. Narodnoye
Dyelo{10} No. 2, pp. 18–19. How is the peasants’ and workers’
struggle to be united? Narodnoye Dyelo No. 2, p. 51: “in the
common popular spirit”. Unprintable.

    


Narodnoge Dyelo No. 2, p. 63: “there should be duping wherever
and whenever possible"!!


Examples of duping: Revolu-
tsionnaya Rossiya No. 11, p. 6:

blood, pettifoggers and so on
and so forth.







    

F) Terrorism.



1. Polemics over Balmashev. Unexampled,


But isn’t the criticism of the Germans unexampled?


((

First you breed
dissatisfaction and then
you yourself suggest that it should be voiced!!

2. Polemics over the April 3 proclamation. Quote

it is not words we attach importance to). No. 7, p. 4: “Terrorism induces
people to think politically.”

—“will instil strength into the

The logic of terrorism:
it is brought out into the forefront, then comes the rest. Proof: back in

1902 it was not a fighting organisation that Revoluisionnaga
Rossiya (No. 4) brought out into the forefront. See reverse

Scepticism, lack of steadfastness,

Terrorism is not dangerous because there is a mass movement. “Frame

Tasks of contemporary revolutionaries:

Economism—an opportunist trend within Russian
Social-Democracy at the turn of the century, a Russian variety of inter
national opportunism. The Economists’ organs were the newspaper
Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought) (1897-1902) and the magazine
Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause) (1899-1902). The so-called Credo,
written by Y. D. Kuskova in 1899, was the programme document of the
Economists whom Lenin called Russian Bernsteinians.  

The views of the Economists were subjected to comprehensive criticism
in Lenin’s works: “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” (aimed against
their Credo and written in 1899 when Lenin was exiled in Siberia; it was
signed by seventeen exiled Marxists), “A Retrograde Trend in Russian
Social-Democracy”, “Apropos of the Profession de foi” (see present
edition, Vol. 4, pp. 167–82, 255–85, 288–96) and “A Talk with Defenders
of Economism” (see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 313–20). Lenin completed
the ideological defeat of Economism in his book What Is To Be
Done?

(see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 347–529). Lenin’s Iskra played

Notes
 
 



{1}
The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held from July 17
(30) to August 10 (23), 1903. The first 13 sittings were held in Brussels,
after which, because of police persecution, the Congress moved to London.


It was prepared by Iskra, which under Lenin’s guidance put in
a tremendous effort to unite Social-Democrats in Russia round the
principles of revolutionary Marxism. Iskra’s Editorial Board
worked out and proposed for discussion at the Congress a draft Party
programme (published in Iskra No. 21 on June 1, 1902). Several
documents for the Congress were written by Lenin: draft Rules of the
R.S.D.L.P., several draft resolutions and a plan for the report on
Iskra’s activity. Lenin also worked out in detail the agenda and
the standing orders of the Congress. The draft Rules and the draft agenda
of the Congress were communicated beforehand to the members of
Iskra’s Editorial Board and then to the delegates.  

The Congress was attended by 43 delegates with vote, representing 26
organisations. Some delegates had two votes each so that the total of votes
at the Congress came to 51. The composition of the Congress was not
homogeneous. It was attended not only by supporters of Iskra, but
also by its opponents, and by unstable and wavering elements. There were 20
items on the agenda of the Congress.  

Lenin delivered the report on the Party Rules and spoke in the debate
on most of the items of the agenda.  

Approval of the Programme and the Rules of the Party and the election
of the Party governing centres were the most important questions before the
Congress. Lenin and his supporters launched a resolute struggle against the
opportunists. The Congress gave a rebuff to the opportunists and approved
the Party Programme almost unanimously (with one abstention). It contained
a formulation of the immediate tasks of the proletariat in the coming
bourgeois-democratic revolution (minimum programme) and the tasks designed
for the victory of the socialist revolution and the establishment of the
dictatorship of the proletariat (maximum programme). For the first time in
the international labour movement since the death of Marx and Engels, a
revolutionary programme was adopted, which stated, on Lenin’s insistence,
that the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat was the principal
task of the working-class party.  

In the debate on the Party Rules there was an acute struggle over the
Party’s organisational principles. Lenin and his supporters



wanted to set up a militant revolutionary party of the working class, which
is why the wording of the first paragraph of the Rules proposed by Lenin
stated that a member must not only accept the Party’s Programme and give it
financial support, but personally participate in the work of one of its
organisations. Martov motioned his own wording of the first paragraph,
which stated that a member need only accept the Programme and give the
Party financial support, and also give regular personal assistance to the
Party under the guidance of one of its organisations. Martov’s wording,
which facilitated access to the Party for unstable elements, was adopted by
a small majority. Otherwise the Congress approved the Rules as worked out
by Lenin. The Congress also adopted a number of resolutions on tactical
questions.  

At the Congress, a split developed between those who consistently
supported Lenin’s Iskra and the “soft” Iskrists, the supporters
of Martov. The former received a majority in the election to the Party’s
central bodies and accordingly took the name of Bolsheviks, while the
latter, the opportunists, received a minority and were called Mensheviks.


The Congress was of tremendous importance for the development of the
working-class movement in Russia. Lenin wrote:

“As a current of political thought and as a political party, Bolshevism
has existed since 1903” (see present edition, Vol. 31, p. 24). The Second
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was a turning-point in the international
working-class movement, because it set up a new type of proletarian party,
which became a model for revolutionary Marxists throughout the world. For
more information about the Second Congress see present edition, Vol. 6,
pp. 467–508.

PROGRAMME OF THE R.S.D.L.P. REGULAR SECOND
CONGRESS{17}

A. Standing orders of the Congress and its constitution.


B. List and priority of questions to be discussed and decided at
the Congress.

C o n g r e s s.




1. The comrade duly
authorised by the Organis-
ing Committee{18} is to open
the Congress.


{ {

In brackets are

d e s i r a b l e

addenda, explanations, advice and other remarks of a particular
character.




2. The Congress is to elect a chairman, two assistants (and deputies) of
the chairman, and 9 secretaries.
These 9{1}

constitute the bureau and have their seats at the same table.


Organising Committee’s report.






3. Election of a committee to verify delegates’ credentials and examine any
applications, complaints and protests relating to the constitution of the
Congress.


(This committee is also to receive the Organising Committee’s statement
concerning the persons, as listed, whom it has invited to attend the
Congress with voice but no
vote.){2}




4. Decision on admitting the Polish
Social-Democrats.{19}

 !




to 3{3}
   







    

5. Order of the Congress
sittings: twice a day from
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from
3 p.m. to 7 p. m. (roughly).






6. Limitation on delegates’ speeches: rapporteurs not more than 30 minutes per
speech; the rest, not more than 10 minutes. No one is entitled to speak more
than twice on any question. On points of order, not more than two speakers
for and two against every proposal.






7. The minutes of the Con gress are to be kept by the secretaries with the
partici pation of the chairman or one of his assistants. Each sitting of the
Congress is to start with the approval of the minutes of the preceding
sitting. Every speaker is to submit to the bureau of the Congress a
summary of each of his speeches within two hours after the sitting.






8. The voting on all the questions except the elec tion of functionaries is to
be by a show of hands. On the demand of ten votes, roll-call vote’s are
to be taken with a record of all votes cast entered in the minutes.


(To accelerate roll-call voting and avoid mistakes, the bureau of the Congress
should give ballot papers on each question to every member of the Congress with
the right of vote. On each ballot paper, the delegate writes his name (see
=

§ 8{4}

)






    

and his vote (yes, no, abstain) and also the question to which his vote
applies. The questions may be designated by abbreviations or even by a figure,
letter, etc. The bureau of the Congress keeps these ballot papers separate ly
for each question until the end of the
Congress.){5}




9. Secret designation of each delegate’s name (or with out name: first and
second delegate from such and such a Party organisation,
etc.).{6}






10. The chairman’s state ment that the Congress has been finally
constituted as the Regular Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party and that, consequent ly’ the decisions of this
Congress shall invalidate all earlier contradictory de cisions adopted by
the Regular



First{20} and sectional congresses—that,
consequently, the decisions of this Congress shall be
absolutely binding on all the Russian S.D.L. Party.


(It is undesirable to touch upon the question of the


Bund{21} in
connection with this point: it is better directly to put it first in,
the list of questions before the Conress.)




11. Discussion of list and priority of questions.

NB: The reasons why this question is brought up into first place: formal
(the Bund’s statements, the composition of the Congress,
subordination to majority), and moral (complete elimination of split and
confusion on basic issue).




2. Approval of the text of

3. Creation of the Party’s Central Organ (newspaper) or confirmation
of one.

This is a detailed elaboration of the standing orders and agenda for
the Congress. Section A was taken as a basis for the standing orders
adopted by the Congress. Section B was the draft agenda
(Tagesordnung) supplied with the commentaries, which, Lenin said,
“was known

delegates at the Congress (see present edition, Vol. 7, p. 31).  

The initial text of the document was supplemented by Lenin on the
strength of remarks received from Martov and possibly other Iskra
supporters as well who had studied it. The text is here given in full with

The Organising Committee (O. C.) for the Convocation of the Second
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was set up at a conference in Pskov on
November 2–3 (15–16), 1902.  

The first attempt to set up an Organising Committee was made at the
Belostok conference of the R.S.D.L.P. committees and organisations (March
23–28 [April 5-10], 1902), which was called on the initiative of the
Economists and Bundists. The Organising Committee elected at the conference
consisted of representatives of Iskra, the Union of Southern
Committees and Organisations of the R.S.D.L.P. and the Bund Central
Committee; it was

   

unable to start work because two of its members were arrested soon after
the conference.  

A conference of Iskra supporters, led by Lenin, met in London
on August 2 (15), 1902, to set up the nucleus of the Russian O.C. It was
decided to invite representatives from the Bund and the Yuzhny
Rabochy group which at the time showed signs of moving closer to
Iskra, and also to give the O.C. the right to co-opt members.


A conference of Social-Democratic organisations at which the O.C. was
constituted was held in Pskov on November 2–3 (15–16). The conference
adopted the text of an “Announcement of the Formation of an Organising
Committee”, which was published as a leaflet in Russia in December 1902.


In early February 1903, the second O.C. conference was held in Orel. It
worked out and adopted draft regulations of the Congress and the list of
organisations entitled to attend it. The regulations were circulated among
the local committees which Were then toured by the members of the O.C. They
were adopted and approved by the local organisations, and served as the
basis for the Organising Committee’s further work in preparing for the
Party’s Second Congress.  

The O.C.’s successful activity, which culminated in the con vocation of
the Congress, was made possible only by the tremendous work in uniting
Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats carried out by Iskra’s
Editorial Board and the Iskra organisation under Lenin’s
direction. In his book, One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, Lenin
wrote: “The Organising Committee was mainly a
commission set up to convene the Congress, a commission deliberately
composed of representatives of different shades, including even the
Bundists; while the real work of creating the organised unity of
the Party was done entirely by the Iskra organisation”

(see present edition, Vol. 7, p. 279).

Polish Social-Democrats—members of the revolutionary party
of the Polish working class, which emerged in 1893, first as the
Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland, and from August 1900, following
the congress of Social-Democratic organisations of the Kingdom of Poland
and Lithuania, whore the Polish and a section of the Lithuanian
Social-Democrats were merged, it was known as the Social-Democracy of the
Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (S.D.K.P. and L.). The fact that the party
directed the Polish working-class movement towards alliance with the
Russian working-class movement and fought against nationalism was to its
credit. At the same time, it made a number of mistakes; it failed to
understand Lenin’s theory of socialist revolution, or the leading role of
the party in the democratic revolution; it underestimated the role of the
peasantry as an ally of the working class and the importance of the
national liberation movement. While criticising the party’s erroneous
views, Lenin emphasised its services to the Polish revolutionary
movement. He noted that Polish Social-Democrats had created “for the first
time a purely proletarian party in Poland and proclaimed the extremely
important

   

principle that the Polish and the Russian workers must maintain the closest
alliance in their class struggle”

(see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 434).

The Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. admitted the
S.D.K.P. and L. into the R.S.D.L.P. as a territorial organisation.  

The S.D.K.P. and L. welcomed the Great October Socialist Revolution and
launched a struggle for the victory of the proletarian revolution in
Poland. At the Unity Congress of the S.D.K.P. and L. and the P.P.S.-Lewica
in December 1918, the two parties merged to form the Communist Workers’
Party of Poland.

The First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held at Minsk from
March 1 to 3 (13–15), 1898. It was attended by nine delegates from six
organisations: the St. Petersburg, Moscow, Yekaterinoslav and Kiev
organisations of the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working
Class, from the group of the Kiev Rabochaya Gazeta and from the
Bund. The Congress elected the Party’s Central Committee, confirmed
Rabochaya Gazeta as the Party’s official organ, issued a Manifesto
and designated the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad as the Party’s
representative abroad (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh
syezdov, konferentsii i plenumov TsK (C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and
Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central
Committee), Part I, 1954, pp. 11–15).  

The importance of the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. lay in the fact
that its decisions and Manifesto proclaimed the establishment of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, thereby playing a great
revolutionary and propagandist part. But the Congress did not adopt a
Programme or work out any Party Rules; the Central Committee elected at the
Congress was arrested and the Rabochaya Gazeta printing-press was
seized, which is why the Congress failed to unite and merge together
separate Marxist circles and organisations. The local organisations were
not guided from a single centre and there was no single line in their work.

The Bund (General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland
and Russia) consisted mainly of semi-proletarian elements among Jewish
artisans in Russia’s western areas. Within the R.S.D.L.P., the Bundists
constantly supported its opportunist wing (Economists, Mensheviks and
liquidators) and waged a struggle against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism.

Borba (Struggle)—a Social-Democratic group abroad which
included D. B. Ryazanov, Y. M. Steklov (Nevzorov) and E. L. Gurevich
(V. Danevich). It was formed in Paris in the summer of 1900 and in May the
following year took the name of Borba. Its publications
(“Materials for the Working out of a Party Programme”, parts I-Ill,
“Leaflet of the Borba Group”, etc.) distorted revolutionary
Marxist theory, giving it a doctrinaire and scholastic interpretation and
taking a hostile attitude to Lenin’s principles of Party organisation. In
view of its departures from Social-Democratic ideas and tactics, its
disorganising activity and lack of connection with Social-Democratic
organisations

   

in Russia, it was not allowed to attend the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., which adopted a decision to dissolve it (see Vtoroi syezd
R.S.D.R.P. [The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.], 1959, p. 438).

{23}

Zhizn (Life)—a literary, scientific and political magazine
published in St. Petersburg from 1897 to 1901. Among its contributors were
“legal Marxists” (M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky, P. B. Struve and others) and
leading writers and critics (A. M. Gorky, A. P. Chekhov, V. V. Veresayev,
S. G. Skitalets, I. A. Bunin and Y. A. Solovyov [Andreyevich]). The
magazine published Marx’s Wages, Price and Profit and Lenin’s
articles “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr. Bulgakov’s
Article)” and “Reply to Mr. P. Nezhdanov” (see present edition, Vol. 4,
pp. 105–59, 460-65).  

Zhizn was closed down by the government in June 1901 and was
resumed abroad in April 1902 by the Zhizn Social-Democratic
group. There were six issues of the magazine, twelve issues of the
Listok Zhizni (Zhizn Handbill) and several publications
in the Biblioteka Zhizni (Zhizn Library) series. The
Zhizn group had some deviations from Social-Democratic views and
tactics, inclining towards Christian socialism and anarchism. It ceased to
exist in December 1902 and the publishing business was wound up.

{24}

Volya (Will)—a group abroad which called itself a
“revolutionary Social-Democratic organisation”. In February 1903, it
issued a leaflet, “To Revolutionaries from the Revolutionary
Social-Democratic Organisation Volya”, which put forward the task
of conducting political agitation among all strata of the population and of
uniting Social-Democrats with Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Volya
group was not a part of the R.S.D.L.P. The Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. adopted a resolution “On the Kuklin Publishers Group and the
Volya Group”, which said:

“The Congress states that neither of these organisations is within the
Party, and that they have nothing in common with organised Social-Democracy
in Russia. The question of future relations between these groups and the
Party is for the Party’s Central Committee to decide in the event these
groups apply to it” (Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 439). Soon
after the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., the group announced its
dissolution and the entry of its members into the R.S.D.L.P.; an
announcement to that effect was inserted in Iskra No. 52 on
November 7, 1903.

The Emancipation of Labour group—the first Russian Marxist
group formed by G. V. Plekhanov in Switzerland in 1883. Among its members
were P. B. Axelrod, L. G. Deutsch, V. I. Zasulich and V. N. Ignatov. It did
much to spread Marxism in Russia and dealt a serious blow at Narodism,
which was the main ideological obstacle to the spread of Marxism and to the
development of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia. Written by
Plekhanov and published by the Emancipation of Labour group, the two draft
programmes of the Russian Social-Democrats (1883 and

   

1885) were an important step in preparing and creating a Social-Democratic
party in Russia. Lenin said that the group “only laid the theoretical
foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step
towards the working-class movement” (see present edition, Vol. 20,
p. 278). Members of the group also made serious mistakes: they
overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie and underestimated the
revolutionary role of the peasantry as a reserve of the proletarian
revolution. These mistakes were the germ of the subsequent Menshevik views
held by Plekhanov and other members of the group.  

In 1894, the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was formed on the
initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group. Members of the group and
their followers left the Union in 1900 and set up a revolutionary
organisation, Sotsial-Demokrat. G. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod and
V. I. Zasulich were on the Editorial Board of Iskra and
Zarya. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., in August 1903,
the Emancipation of Labour group announced its dissolution.

Iskra’s organisation in Russia united Iskra
supporters operating inside Russia. During the preparation for publishing
Iskra and in the first year of its publication (December
1900-December 1901) a network of Iskra agents was set up in
various towns of Russia. Among them were P. N. Lepeshinsky and
0. B. Lepeshinskaya, P. A. Krasikov, A. M. Stopani, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky
and Z. P. Krzhizhanovskaya, S. I. Radchenko and L. N. Radchenko,
A. D. Tsyurupa, N. E. Bauman and I. V. Babushkin. Iskra pro motion
groups were set up in a number of cities, including St. Petersburg, Pskov,
Samara and Poltava.  

The growth of the revolutionary movement and the increasing volume of
practical work insistently urged the need to unite the Iskra
forces and place their work on a planned and organised basis, which would
help to solve the main task, that of overcoming the amateurish methods
introduced by the Economists and winning over the Social-Democratic
committees. In this connection, Lenin put forward a plan for an all-Russia
Iskra organisation, which was to prepare the unification of
Social-Democratic organisations in the country into an integrated,
centralised Marxist party. This plan was initially set out by Lenin in his
article “Where To Begin?” (May 1901) and then elaborated in the pamphlet
What Is To Be Done? (autumn of 1901-February 1902)

(see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 13–24, 347–529).



In implementing the plan for the establishment of an integrated
Iskra organisation in Russia, Lenin and his supporters had to
overcome narrow local (regional) tendencies among some Iskra
practitioners.  

A congress of Iskra workers was held in Samara in January 1902
and was attended by G. M. Krzhizhanovsky and Z. P. Krzhizhanovskaya,
F. V. Lengnik, M. A. Silvin, V. P. Artsybushev, D. I. Ulyanov,
M. I. Ulyanova and others. The congress set up a Bureau of the
Iskra organisation in Russia.  


Armed with Lenin’s book What Is To Be Done?, Iskra
workers vigorously set about spreading and realising Lenin’s plan for the
establishment of the party. The Iskra organisation in Russia
achieved a great deal in actually uniting party organisations on the
principles of revolutionary Marxism. By the end of 1902, almost all the
major Social-Democratic committees had announced their solidarity with
Iskra.  

The Organising Committee for Convening the Party’s Second Congress, to
which the Iskra organisations handed over all their connections,
was set up at a conference in Pskov on November 2–3 (15–16), 1902, with
the most active participation of Iskra workers. The Iskra
organisation in Russia operated until the Second Congress and played an
important part in preparing and convoking the Congress, which set up the
revolutionary Marxist party in Russia.

The “Yuzhny Rabochy” group—a Social-Democratic group
formed in the south of Russia by the autumn of 1900 round a newspaper of
the same name. The newspaper Yuzhny Rabochy (Southern Worker) was
published illegally from 1900 to 1903. Twelve numbers were issued, the
first in January 1900 by the Yekaterinoslav Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. At
various times, I. Kh. Lalayants, A. Vilensky, 0. A. Kogan (Yermansky),
B. S. Tseitlin, Y. Y. Levin and Y. S. Levina, V. N. Rozanov and others were
members of the group and the Editorial Board.  

In contrast to the Economists, the Yuzhny Rabochy group
believed that the main task of the proletariat was to carry on political
struggle for the overthrow of the autocracy. It opposed terrorism, upheld
the idea of launching a mass revolutionary movement and carried out
considerable revolutionary work in the south of Russia. But the group
tended to overrate the role of the liberal bourgeoisie and attached no
importance to the peasant movement. In opposition to the Iskra
plan for creating a centralised Marxist party through the unification of
the revolutionary Social-Democrats round Iskra, the Yuzhny
Rabochy group put forward a plan for restoring the R.S.D.L.P. by
setting up regional Social-Democratic associations. In his One Step
Forward, Two Steps Back, Lenin said the Yuzhny Rabochy group
was one of those organisations “which, while verbally recognising
Iskra as the leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own
and were unstable in matters of principle”

(present edition, Vol. 7, p. 211).

At the Second Congress of the Party, the Yuzhny Rabochy delegates
took a Centrist position (Lenin called them “middling opportunists”).


The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. decided to dissolve the
Yuzhny Rabochy group, like all other separate Social-Democratic
groups and organisations (see Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959,
p. 439).

{28}

P.P.S. (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna—Polish
Socialist Party)—a reformist nationalist party set up in 1892. It
had a programme based on the struggle for an independent Poland, and under
the leadership of Pilsudski and his followers it carried on separatist

   

nationalistic propaganda among the Polish workers in an effort to draw them
away from joint struggle with the Russian workers against the autocracy and
capitalism.  

In 1906 it split up into the P.P.S.-Lewica (Left-wing) and the
Right-wing, chauvinist P.P.S., known as the “revolutionary faction”.


Under the influence of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) and of the
S.D.K.P. and L. (the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and
Lithuania), the P.P.S.-Lewica gradually went over to consistent
revolutionary positions.  

During the First World War, most of its members took an
internationalist stand and in December 1918 merged with the
S.D.K.P. and L. These two parties constituted the Communist Workers’ Party
of Poland (as the Communist Party of Poland was called until 1925).  

During the First World War, the Right-wing P.P.S. continued to conduct
its national-chauvinist policy. When the bourgeois Polish state was formed,
the Right-wing P.P.S. in 1919 united with sections of the P.P.S. on the
territory of Poland earlier occupied by Germany and Austria and once again
took the name of P.P.S. With the government in its hands, it helped the
Polish bourgeoisie to take over power and then launched a systematic
anti-communist campaign, supporting the policy of aggression against the
Soviet state, and the policy of occupying and oppressing Western Ukraine
and Western Byelorussia. Some groups in the P.P.S. which disagreed with
this policy went over to the Communist Party of Poland.  

Following the fascist coup staged by Pilsudski in May 1926, the
P.P.S. was nominally in opposition in Parliament, but actually conducted no
active struggle against the fascist regime and continued its anti-communist
and anti-Soviet propaganda. In this period, Left-wing elements in the
P.P.S. co-operated with the Polish Communists and supported the
united-front tactics in a number of campaigns.  

During the Second World War, the P.P.S. split up once again. Its
reactionary and chauvinist section, which called itself
“Wolność, Równość,
Niepodleglość” (Freedom, Equality, Independence), took
part in the reactionary Polish government in exile (London). The Left-wing
section of the P.P.S., which called itself the Workers’ Part of Polish
Socialists (W.P.P.S.), under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party
(P.W.P.), set up in 1942, joined the popular front of struggle against the
nazi invaders, I ought for the liberation of Poland from the fascist
enslavement and favoured friendship with the U.S.S.R.  

In 1944, following the liberation of the eastern part of Poland from
the German occupation and the establishment of the Polish Committee of
National Liberation, the W.P.P.S. once again took the name of P.P.S. and
together with the P.W.P. set a out building up a democratic people’s
Poland. In December 1948, the P.W.P. and the P.P.S. merged into the Polish
United Workers Party (P.U.W.P.).

{29}

The Amsterdam International Socialist Congress of the Second
International was held from August 14 to 20, 1904. It dealt with the
following questions: 1) international rules of socialist tactics; 2)
colonial policy; 3) general strike; 4) social policy and workers’
insurance; 5) trusts and unemployment, and other questions.  

The attitude to bourgeois parties was expressed in a resolution called
“International Rules of Socialist Tactics”, which prohibited socialists
from taking part in bourgeois governments and censured “any urge to gloss
over existing class contradictions with a view to facilitating a
rapprochement with bourgeois parties”. The Congress decisions, while being
a step forward, went only a part of the way and wore a further concession
to opportunism. The Congress failed to raise the question of the mass
strike developing into an armed uprising or to give a rebuff to Right-wing
opportunists who were inclined to justify the colonial policy of the
imperialist powers. While saying that it condemned revisionism, the
Congress failed to declare a break with it, and said nothing about the
proletarian revolution or the dictatorship of the proletariat.

p. 83





{30}

The Party Council (1903–05) was set up under the Party Rules
adopted by the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. as the highest Party
institution designed to co-ordinate and unify the activity of the Central
Committee and the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and to restore the
C.C. and the Editorial Board of the C.O. in the event the entire membership
of either of these bodies was gone, and also to represent the Party in
relations with other parties. The Council had the task of convening Party
congresses within the period laid down by the Rules or before the due date,
upon the demand of Party organisations which together commanded one-half of
the congress votes. The Party Council consisted of five members, one of
whom was appointed by the Party congress and the others by the Central
Committee and the C.O. Editorial Board, which had two members each on the
Council. The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. elected G.V. Plekhanov as
the fifth member of the Council. Lenin was elected a member of the Council
from the C.O. Editorial Board, and from the C.C. when he left
Iskra. Following Plekhanov’s orientation towards opportunism and
the Mensheviks’ seizure of the Editorial Board, the Party Council became an
instrument of the Mensheviks’ struggle against the Bolsheviks. Lenin waged
a consistent struggle in the Council to unite the Party, exposing the
disorganising and splitting activity of the Mensheviks. Under the Rules
adopted by the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., the Council was abolished.

JULY 17 (30)
1

In the plan, the question of the programme is In the second place. The national
question is a part of the programme and is to be dealt with when the latter is
discussed. The question of regional and national organisations in general is an
organisatlonal one. But the question of attitude to the nationalities, in
particular, is a tactical question and is an application of our general
principles to practical activity.

2

The first item on the list relates specially to the Bund organisation. The sixth
relates to the Party organisation. Upon the establishment of general rules for
local, regional, national and other organisations, this special question is
raised: which organisations and on what terms shall be recruited to the Party?

Notes

The first speech is in reply to M. I. Lieber’s question: “How are we
to understand the point about the national question?  Why is it separated
out from the point about the draft programme? What is the meaning of the
national question being a question of tactics? Why is this question not
regarded as a cardinal one?”  

The second speech is in reply to another of Lieber’s questions:

   

“How are we to understand the point about national organisations? This
question appears to be raised independently of the question of the Bund’s
status in the Party” (Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, pp. 17–18).


The first point, mentioned by Lenin, in the list of questions subject
to debate at the Congress (“On the Bund’s Status in the R.S.D.L.P.”) was
second on the agenda adopted by the Congress, and point six (“Regional and
National Organisations”) was seventh.

Lenin spoke twice on the question of the Organising Committee’s actions
in calling the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.

For his first speech see present edition, Vol. 6, p. 484 and Note 136.

The Congress adopted the following resolution: 

“With the election of the committee, whose task is to determine the
composition of the Congress, the Organising Committee has lost its right as
a collegium to exert an influence on the composition of the Congress, and
its activity, as a collegium, is deemed to have ceased on this point”

I do not see any weighty arguments against an invitation. The Organising
Committee has taken the first step in bringing the Polish comrades closer to the
Russian. By inviting them to our Congress we shall take a second step in the
same direction. I do not see this producing any complications.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The question of the representatives of the S.D.K.P. and L. attending
the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was first raised on the initiative of
the Iskra Editorial Board in a letter sent by the Organising
Committee for the Convocation of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. to
the S.D.K.P. and L. Committee Abroad on February 7, 1903.  

The terms on which the Polish Social-Democrats could be united with the
R.S.D.L.P. were discussed at the Fourth Congress of the
S.D.K.P. and L. which was held from July 11 to 16 (24–29), 1903. The
Congress formulated a number of terms for a possible merger, one of them
being the demand for a change in the formulation of the R.S.D.L.P.’s
Programme clause on the right of nations to self-determination.  

When the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. opened, its delegates had no
knowledge of this decision. The committee to deter mine the composition of
the Congress end verify mandates, in its report to the Congress on July 18
(31), read out a letter from the Polish Social-Democrat A. Warski
(A. S. Warszawski), which it had at its disposal. But the letter did not
clarify the relations the Polish Social-Democrats wanted to establish with
the R.S.D.L.P. The committee decided to invite the Polish Social-Democrats
to attend the Congress with voice only. A. Warski and J. Hanecki arrived at
the Congress on July 22 (August 4) and Warski announced the decision of the
Fourth Congress of the S.D.K.P. and L. concerning the terms for unification
with the R.S.D.L.P. A special committee was elected to examine these terms.


The point on the right of nations to self-determination, raised by the
Polish Social-Democrats, was discussed in the Programme Committee. No
minutes were taken, but the notes made at the third sitting of the
committee by Lenin

(see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 7,
pp. 423–24)

show that the

   

Polish Social-Democrats objected to the point on the right of nations to
self-determination and proposed that the programme should contain a demand
for the establishment of institutions guaranteeing complete freedom of
cultural development for all nations within a state. As Lenin later pointed
out: “instead of self-determination they practically proposed the
notorious ‘cultural-national autonomy’, only under another name”

(see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 444).

The committee rejected the proposals of the Polish
Social-Democrats. Realising that they would be unable to maintain these
proposals at the Congress, they left it after making a statement setting
out their standpoint. Their statement was read out at the Congress on
July 29 (August 11). On August 6 (19), in connection with the report by the
committee, which had examined the terms for a merger of the
S.D.K.P. and L. with the R.S.D.L.P., as proposed by the Polish
Social-Democrats, the Congress adopted a resolution expressing regret over
the fact that the withdrawal of the Polish Social-Democrats from the
Congress deprived it of the possibility of completing the discussion of the
S.D.K.P. and L.’s joining the R.S.D.L.P., and instructed the Central
Committee to continue the negotiations.  

The speech reported here is Lenin’s second. The first was given in
Vol. 6 of the present edition, p. 485.

A reference to an amendment to the paragraph of the general section of
the draft programme which said: “But as all these contradictions, which
are inherent in bourgeois society, increase and develop, the discontent
among the labouring and exploited masses with the existing state of things
grows, the number and the solidarity of proletarians increase, and their
struggle against their exploiters becomes sharper.” When this paragraph
was discussed by the Programme Committee (a sitting Lenin did not attend)
the word “consciousness” was inserted after the words “the number and
the solidarity”.  

The amendment was rejected by the Congress, with a majority voting for
the original wording.

The point at issue is § I of the general political demands of the
draft Party programme, which was given the following wording by the
Programme Committee: “The sovereignty of the people, that is,
concentration of all the supreme state power in the hands of a legislative
assembly constituting a single chamber and made up of representatives of
the people” (Vtoroi speed R.S.D.R.P., 1959,
p. 179). K. M. Takhtarev (Strakhov) proposed that the words “sovereignty
of the people” should be substituted by the words “supremacy of the

Notes
 
 



{1}

The draft proposals here published were tabled by Lenin at a sitting of
the Programme Committee during the second discussion of the wording of
§ 7 of the general political demands of the Party Programme (§ 6
of the Iskra draft).  

In the Iskra draft programme this paragraph contained a demand
for the abolition of the social estates and lull equality of rights for all
citizens, regardless of sex, creed or race. During the initial discussion,
the end of the paragraph had been reworded as follows: “Creed, race,
nationality and language”, and was so tabled at the 16th sitting of the
Congress on July 30 (August 12). During its discussion at the Congress, the
Bundists demanded the inclusion in the Party Programme of a special point
on the “equality of languages”. They succeeded in winning over a section
of the vacillating Iskra supporters and there was a split when the
proposal was put to the vote.  

The wording of § 7 was again referred to the Programme
Committee. Lenin’s proposals with slight stylistic changes were adopted by
the committee and on its behalf tabled at the 21st sitting of the Congress
on August 1 (14). The Congress rejected the first point of the proposals
and adopted the second with some amendments (§ 8 in the Programme
adopted by the Congress); point three was adopted without alteration.  

Paragraph 11, of which Lenin spoke in point 3 of his proposals, had the
following wording in the Iskra draft: “Free and compulsory
general and vocational education for all children of either sex up to the
age of 16. Provision of poor children with food, clothing and study aids at
the expense of the state.” The Programme Committee initially adopted this
paragraph without amendment (§ 14), but during its discussion at the
18th sitting of the Congress on July 31 (August 13) the following addendum
was adopted: “Instruction in the native language, on the demand of the
population” (Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 198). This
addendum became superfluous with the adoption of a separate point on the
question of language.

does not object to a 42-hour rest but, addressing Lieber, remarks that
the programme speaks of supervision over all industries. An indication of the
actual size will merely restrict the sense. When our programme is a bill we
shall write in the
details.{1}

I object to Comrade Lyadov’s =
amendment.{2} His first two
amendments are superfluous, because in our programme we demand labour protection
for all the branches of the economy and, consequently, for agriculture
as well. As for the third, it applies entirely to the agrarian section and we
shall return to it when debating our draft agrarian programme.

{1}

The point at issue is § 2 of the section of the draft programme
dealing with labour protection, which contained a demand for a statutory
weekly period of rest running continuously for at least 36 hours, for
wage-workers of either sex in all branches of

   

the national economy. Lyadov proposed that the period should run for
42 hours; Lieber remarked that the programme said nothing about supervision
in small-scale production. Lyadov’s proposal was adopted by the Congress,
and Lieber’s amendment was rejected.

p. 88





{2}

The point at issue is § 12 of the section of the draft programme
dealing with labour protection (511 of the Iskra draft), which
contained a demand for “supervision by the organs of local
self-government, with the participation of workers’ delegates, over the
sanitary state of the living quarters provided for workers by their
employers, and also over the internal regulations on these premises and the
terms of their lease, to safeguard wage workers against intervention by
employers in their life and activity as private persons and
citizens”. Lyadov motioned the following addenda to this paragraph: 

1) agrarian Inspection to be established for supervision over all
agricultural enterprises employing wage labour; 2) points 1–13 of the
section of the programme dealing with labour protection to be extended to
all agriculture with wage labour; 3) tenants holding land as sharecroppers,
or indentured to cultivate the landowner’s land, to be regarded as
wage-workers falling within the province of the agrarian inspection. The
Congress rejected the first two addenda and Lyadov withdrew the third.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE AGRARIAN
PROGRAMME 
 AUGUST 1 (14) 
1

L e n i n

tables this amendment: instead of “will work for”
insert “demands above
all”.{1} The reports during
the debates pointed out that the draft deliberately says “will work
for” in order to emphasise that we do net intend to do this now but in the
future. I motion this amendment to avoid giving ground for such
misunderstandings. By the words “above all” I mean that we have
other demands, apart from the agrarian programme.

    

2

I object to Comrade Lyadov’s
proposal.{2} We are not drafting a
law, but are merely giving general indications. There are those among the
townsfolk who also belong to the poll-tax paying estates; in addition, there are
the small tradesmen in the suburbs and others, and if we were to write all this
into our programme we should have to use the idiom of Volume IX of the Code of
Laws.

3

I find Martynov’s question
superfluous.{3} Instead of putting
forward general principles we are being forced into particulars. If we were to
do so, we should never come to the end of the Congress. The principle is quite
definite:
every peasant has the right to dispose of his land, whether belonging to the
commune or held as private property. That is nothing but the
demand of the peasant’s right to dispose of his land. We insist that there
should be no special laws for the peasant; we want more than the right of
withdrawing from the commune. We are unable just now to decide on all the
particulars that may crop up in implementing this. I am against Comrade
Lange’s addendum; we cannot demand the abolition of all the laws governing
tenure. That is going too far.

4

Martynov must be labouring under a misunderstanding. What we want is uniform
application of general legislation, the one now accepted in all the bourgeois
states, namely, that which is based on the principles of Roman law and which
recognises both personal and common property. We should like to regard communal
land-holdings as common property.

5

We are engaged in the drafting of addenda to § 4 in respect of the
Caucasus. These addenda should be inserted after point a). There are two draft
resolutions. If we adopt Comrade Karsky’s amendment, the point will lose
heavily in concreteness. In the Urals, for instance, there is a host

    

of survivals; over there, there is a veritable reservation of
serfdom. Concerning the Latvians we could say that they fit the formula:
“and in other regions of the state”. I support Comrade
Kostrov’s proposal, namely: we must insert a demand for the transfer of
land titles to the khizani, the temporarily bound and
others.{4}

6

Paragraph 5 is connected with paragraph 16 of the labour programme: this does
imply courts consisting equally of workers and employers; we must demand special
representation for the farm labourers and the poor

peasantry.{5}

7

I believe this to be unnecessary, since it would extend the competence of the
courts out of all
proportion.{6} Our aim is to secure a reduction of
rents, but the establishment of tariffs would enable the landowners to argue
their case by referring to definite facts. The reduction of rent-prices rules
out any idea of their increase. Kautsky, speaking of Ireland, said that some
results were obtained there by the introduction of industrial courts.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The amendment was motioned by Lenin during the discussion of the
preamble of the draft programme on the agrarian question, which said: “For
the purpose, however, of eliminating the survivals of the serf system,
which are a heavy burden on the peasants, and in the interests of the free
development of the class struggle in the countryside, the Party will work
for....” The Congress adopted the amendment.

p. 88





{2}

The point at issue is § 1 of the draft programme on the agrarian
question, which contained a demand for the “abolition of land redemption
and quit-rent payments and all other services now borne by the peasants as
a poll-tax paying estate”. Lyadov proposed the addition: “or other rural
inhabitants, as poll-tax paying estates”. The amendment was rejected by
the Congress.

p. 89





{3}

During the debate on § 2 of the draft programme on the agrarian
question, which spoke of the need to abolish collective liability and all
other laws hampering the peasant in his disposal of the land, Martynov
asked this question: “How are we to under stand the words: ‘his land’?”
He believed that two interpretations of this point were possible: “1)
every peasant has the right of redemption; in that case the interests of
the commune are not infringed; 2) every peasant has the right to
appropriate the land without redemption.” Following Lenin’s explanation,
Martynov spoke again and said that he was not thinking about particulars
but about the general principle: who was the owner of the land—the
commune or the peasant? He went on: “If it is the commune, then regarding
it as a constraint on economic development, we

   

stand for the right of redemption. If it is the peasant, there is no need
for redemption” (Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 235).

p. 89





{4}

Paragraph 4 of the draft programme on the agrarian question contained a
demand for the “establishment of peasants’ committees:

a) for the restitution to the village communes (by expropriation or, when
the land has changed hands, by redemption by the state at the expense of
gentry-owned large landed estates) of the land cut off from the peasants
when serfdom was abolished and now used by the land lords as a means of
keeping the peasants in bondage; b) for the elimination of the survivals of
serf relations, which have been preserved in the Urals, in the Altai, in
the Western territory and in other regions of the state...”.  

N. N. Jordania (Kostrov) motioned the following addendum to this point:
“for the transfer into the ownership of the peasants in the Caucasus of
the lands of which they have the use as temporarily bound, khizani, etc.”
(Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 243). The second proposal was
motioned by B. M. Knunyants (Rusov) and M. N. Lyadov, who believed that it
was possible for the programme to confine itself to a general statement of
the need for eliminating the survivals of serf relations all over Russia.


The amendment of D. A. Topuridze (Karsky), mentioned by Lenin in his
speech, was not entered in the minutes of the Congress.  

The Congress adopted Jordania’s addendum.  

Khizani—the name given to the peasants of Georgia who
settled on the lands of the landowners on specially agreed terms. The
khizani were not officially regarded as serfs, and enjoyed personal
freedom, but remained perpetual tenants without any rights. The 1861
Peasant Reform did not apply to them and they continued to be completely
dependent on the landowners, who began to increase khizani services and
confiscate the land they held. The khizani system was abolished after the
Great October Socialist Revolution.  

Temporarily bound peasants—the name given to those former
serf peasants who were compelled to perform certain services (quit-rent or
corvée) for the use of their land even after the abolition of
serfdom in 1861 and until they started paying redemption money to the
landowner for their allotments. From the moment the redemption contract was
concluded, the peasants ceased to be “temporarily bound” and became
“peasant property-owners”.

p. 90





{5}

Paragraph 5 of the draft programme on the agrarian question spoke of
the need to empower the courts to reduce excessive rents and declare
invalid transactions of an enslaving character. § 16 of the section of
the draft programme dealing with labour protection contained the demand for
the establishment of industrial courts consisting of an equal number of
workers’ and employers’ representatives in every branch of the national
economy.

p. 90





{6}

Lenin’s objection is against Lieber’s proposal to introduce into
§ 5 of the draft programme on the agrarian question the demand to
empower the courts to establish land-lease prices.

finds the first formulation unsuitable because it lends the Council an
arbitral
character.{1} The Council, however, must be not only an
arbitral institution, but also one co-ordinating the activity of the C.C. and
the Central Organ. He also speaks out in favour of the Congress appointing a
fifth member. It may well happen that the four members of the Council will be
unable to elect a fifth; we shall then find ourselves without a necessary
institution.

2

L e n i n

finds Comrade Zasulich’s arguments
unsatisfactory.{2}

The case she described already implies struggle; in that case the Rules
will be of no help. By leaving the election of the fifth member to the four
members of the Council, we introduce struggle into the Rules. He considers it
necessary to note that the Council is more than a reconciliation body. Thus,
for instance, under the Rules, two members of the Council have the right to
convene it.

3

L e n i n

favours the retention of this phrase; no one should be barred from
taking his appeal to the centre. That is a necessary condition of
=

centralisation.{3}

4{4}

There are two questions here. The first is about the qualified majority, and I
object to the proposal to reduce it from four-fifths down to
two-thirds. Introduction of a motivated protest would show lack of foresight and
I object to
it.{5} The second question is immensely more
important—the right of mutual control over co-optation by the C.C. and the
Central Organ. The mutual accord of the two centres is a necessary condition of
harmony. This is a question of a break between the two centres. Those who do not
want a split must see to it that there is harmony. We know from the life of the
Party

    

that there have been people who introduced splits. This is a question of
principle; it is an important question and the whole of the Party’s future
may depend on it.  
5

The Rules may have been lame in one leg, now Comrade
Yegorov makes them lame in
both.{6} The Council is to co-opt only in exceptional cases. Complete
confidence is necessary for both sides, for both centres, just because this
is a complex mechanism. There can be no successful work together without
full mutual trust. And the entire question of correct functioning together
is closely bound up with the right of co-optation. Comrade Deutsch is wrong
in exaggerating the technical difficulties.

{1}

During the debate on the first clause of § 4 of the draft
Rules—the order governing the appointment of members of the Party Council
and the replacement of outgoing Council members—the Rules Committee
failed to reach agreement and three formulations were put before the
Congress.  

The first, motioned by L. Martov and V. A. Noskov (Glebov), said: “The
Party Council shall be appointed by the Editorial Board of the Central
Organ and the Central Committee, each of whom shall delegate two members to
the Council; these four members of the Council shall invite the fifth;
outgoing members of the Council shall be replaced by the institutions
appointing them.”  

The second, tabled by V. I. Lenin and V. N. Rozanov (Popov), said:
“The Party Council shall be appointed by the Congress from among the
members of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and the Central
Committee and shall consist of five persons, with at least two of them from
each of these collegiums. The Council itself shall replace the outgoing
members of the Council.”  

The third, motioned by Y. Y. Levin (Yegorov), said: “The Congress
shall elect two members of the C.C. and two of the Editorial Board of the
Central Organ to the Council of the Party. These four elected members shall
unanimously elect the fifth; outgoing members of the Council shall be
replaced by the organisations to which they belong, with the exception of
the fifth, who shall be replaced in the manner specified above.”  

As a result of the discussion of this question, the Congress adopted
the following formulations: 

“4. The Congress shall appoint the fifth member of the Council, the
Central Committee and the Editorial Board of the Central Organ.  

“5. The Council of the Party shall be appointed by tile Editorial
Board of the Central Organ and the C.C., each of whom shall delegate two
members to the Council; outgoing members of the council shall be replaced
by the institutions appointing them, the fifth shall be replaced by the
Council itself” (Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 426).

p. 91





{2}

In the discussion of the first clause of § 4 of the draft Rules,
Vera Zasulich said: “The objection that the four members of the Council
will be unable to elect the fifth is groundless: if an institution like the
Council is unable to elect a fifth member, it means that it is altogether
incapable of operating” (Vtoroi spent R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 296).

p. 91





{3}

The point at issue is § 10 of the draft Rules, which says: “Every
member of the Party and every person having any dealings with the Party
shall have the right to demand that his statement, in its original form, is
communicated to the Central Committee or to the Editorial Board of the
Central Organ, or to the Party congress” (Vtoroi syezd
R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 426). Lenin spoke against Martov’s proposal to
remove the words “and every person having any dealings with the
Party”. Martov’s proposal was rejected.

p. 91





{4}

The speech relates to § 12 of the draft Party Rules dealing with
the co-optation to the Party’s collegiate institutions, including the
C.C. and the C.O. In his book One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
Lenin wrote: “Greater strictness as regards the majority required f or
adoption of members (four-fifths instead of two-thirds), the requirement of
unanimity for co-optation, mutual control over co-optation to the centre
bodies—all this we began to advocate when we found ourselves in the
minority on the question of the personal composition of the central
bodies” (see present edition, Vol. 7, p. 298). Martov came out
against the proposal that the demand for the unanimity and mutual control
of the C.C. and the C.O. in matters of co-optation should be written into
the Rules.

p. 91





{5}

Y. Y. Levin (Yegorov) objected to any qualification (two-thirds or
four-fifths) of the majority necessary for co-optation to th Party’s
collegiate institutions, believing that in the absence of any motivated
protest the question could be decided by a simple majority.

p. 91





{6}

Y. Y. Levin (Yegorov) said in his speech that the draft Rules were
“lame” because they contained no point empowering the Party Council to
decide on the question of co-optation to the Party central bodies.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE PARTY RULES

 AUGUST 5 (18) 
1

Let me reply briefly to both
objections.{1} Comrade Martov says that I propose the unanimity of the
two collegiums in co-opting members; that is not right. The Congress has
decided not to give the right of veto to each member of two, possibly
rather extensive, collegiums, but that does not

    

mean that we cannot vest this authority in the institution co-ordinating
all the joint work of the two centres. The joint work of the two centres
demands complete unanimity and even personal unity, and that is possible
only if co-optation is unanimous. After all, if two members find
co-optation necessary, they are entitled to convene the Council.  
2

Martov’s amendment contradicts the already adopted point on
the unanimous co-optation to the C.C. and the
C.O.{2} 
3

Comrade Martov’s interpretation is wrong, because the
exemption contradicts
unanimity.{3} I appeal to the Congress and request it to decide whether
Comrade Martov’s amendment should be put to the vote.  
4

I should not argue with Comrades Glebov and Deutsch in
substance, but I considered it necessary to mention the
League{4} in the Rules, first, because everyone knew of the League’s
existence, second, to make note of the League’s representation in the Party
under the old rules, and third, because all other organisations have the
status of commit tees, whereas the League is introduced to bring out its
special
status.{5}

A reference to the speeches of Trotsky and Martov objecting to Lenin’s

A reference to Martov’s proposal during the debate on § 12 of the
draft Rules: “In the event no unanimity is reached in co-opting new
members to the C.C. or to the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, the
question of the member’s admission may be referred to the Council, and in
the event it annuls the decision of the collegium in question, the latter
shall take a final decision by a simple majority” (Vtoroi syezd
R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 311).

A reference to Martov’s words: “I propose that a majority dissatisfied
with a minority decision should be entitled to appeal to the Council for a
decision” (Vtoroi spent R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 311). Martov’s
amendment was adopted by the Congress by 24 votes to 23.

{4}

The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad
was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative. Affiliated to the League
were the Iskra organisation abroad and the
Sotsial-Demokrat.  revolutionary organisation which included the
Emancipation of Labour group. The task of the League was to spread the
ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and to help create a militant
Social-Democratic organisation. Under its Rules, the League was the
Iskra organisation abroad. It recruited Iskra supporters
from among Russian Social-Democrats abroad, gave Iskra material
assistance, organised the delivery of the newspaper to Russia and published
popular Marxist literature. The Second Congress

   

of the R.S.D.L.P. confirmed the League as the only Party organisation
abroad with the status of a committee, authorising it to work under the
guidance and control of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.  

After the Second Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched themselves in the
League and launched a struggle against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. At the
League’s Second Congress in October 1903, the Mensheviks secured the
adoption of new Rules aimed against the Party Rules, as approved by the
Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. From then on the League became a
Menshevik strong hold. It operated until 1905.

In his speech Lenin replies to V. A. Noskov (Glebov) and L. G. Deutsch,
who proposed that § 13 (on the recognition of the League of Russian
Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as the only R.S.D.L.P. organisation
abroad, and on its tasks) should not be included in the Rules, but referred
for discussion to the Central Committee (Glebov) or to the Party Council
(Deutsch). § 13 of the Rules was adopted by 31 votes to 12, with 6
abstentions.

DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE STATEMENT BY MARTYNOV AND
AKIMOV{1} 

Recognising the statement made by Comrades Martynov and
Akimov as contradicting our concept of members of the Congress and even
members of the Party, the Congress invites Comrades Akimov and Martynov
either to withdraw their statement or to make a definite statement of their

    

withdrawal from the Party. As for the minutes, the Congress in any case
offers them the opportunity to attend the special sitting to approve the
minutes.

Following the approval by the Congress of § 13 of the Rules,
recognising the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as
the R.S.D.L.P. only organisation abroad, delegates of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad, Martynov and Akimov, informed the Bureau of the
Congress that they would not take part in the voting and would attend the
Congress only to hear the minutes of earlier sittings and to discuss the
manner of their publication. Their statement was read out at the 27th
sitting of the Congress on August 5 (18). The Congress invited Akimov and
Martynov to withdraw their statement, but they rejected the proposal and
walked out.  

Lenin did not move the draft resolution at the Congress. In the
original the draft is crossed out. The reason may have been that the Bureau
of the Congress had decided to refer the question for discussion at the
Congress.

 SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE STATEMENT BY MARTYNOV AND AKIMOV 
AUGUST 5 (15)
1

The bureau has discussed the statement by Comrades Martynov
and Akimov which they filed at the morning sitting. I shall not go into the
motivation, although it is wrong and extremely strange. No one has ever
declared the
Union{1} closed and Comrades Martynov and Akimov made an incorrect
inference from the Congress decision on the League. But even the closure of
the Union could not deprive delegates of the right to participate in the
work of the Congress. Similarly, the Congress cannot allow any refusal to
take part in the voting. A member of the Congress is not free merely to
approve the minutes without taking part in the rest of its work. For the
time being, the bureau does not propose any resolution and refers this
question for debate at the Congress. The statement by Martynov and Akimov
is extremely abnormal and contradicts the status of member of the Congress.

2

What an absurd and abnormal situation we now have. On the
one hand, we are told that the decisions of the Congress are being
accepted, and on the other, there is the intention to withdraw over a
decision on the Rules. By arriving here as a delegate of an organisation
recognised by the Organising Committee, each one of us has become a member
of the Congress. This title is not abolished by the dissolution of an
organisation. What are we, the bureau, to do during the voting? We cannot
simply omit those who

    

have left, because the Congress has already approved its
constitution. There is one logical conclusion that suggests itself:
withdrawal from the ranks of the Party altogether. The minutes may be
approved with comrades of the Union being specially invited to attend,
although the Congress is entitled to approve its minutes even without them.

{1}

The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in
1894 on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group, on the
understanding that all its members accept the programme of the group.  

The First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. recognised the Union as the
Party’s representative abroad. Subsequently opportunist
elements—Economists (the so-called “young”)—gained the upper hand in
the Union. The opportunist majority of the First Congress of the Union of
Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, held at Zurich in November 1898, refused
to voice solidarity with the Manifesto of the First Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. In view of this, the Emancipation of Labour group announced at
the Congress its refusal to edit publications of the Union, with the
exception of No. 5–6 of Rabotnik which bad been prepared for the
press, and Lenin’s pamphlets, The Tasks of Russian
Social-Democrats and The New
   

Factory Law. In April 1899, the Union started to publish the
magazine Rabocheye Dyelo on whose Editorial Board were the
Economists B. N. Krichevsky, V. P. Ivanshin and P. F. Teplov. The Union
voiced its sympathy with E. Bernstein, the Millerandists, etc.  

The struggle within the Union continued until its Second Congress in
April 1900 and at the Congress. The Emancipation of Labour group and its
followers walked out from the Congress and formed an independent
organisation called Sotsial-Demokrat.  

At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., representatives of the Union
(Rabocheye Dyelo supporters) adopted an extremely opportunist
stand and walked out when the Congress recognised the League of Russian
Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as the Party’s only organisation
abroad. The Union was dissolved by a decision of the Second Congress (see
Vtoroi syezd R.S.D.R.P., 1959, p. 438).

We were reproached for the existence of a compact
majority. That is not a bad thing in itself. Since a compact
majority{1} has been formed here, the question of whether the elected
Central Committee will prove to be capable of functioning has already been
weighed. There is no question of chance. There is a full guarantee. The
election cannot be postponed. Very little time remains. Comrade Martov’s
proposal to postpone the election is groundless. I support Comrade Rusov’s

proposal.{2}

Osvobozhdeniye{2} are not the same thing at all. It would be
harmful to take the same attitude to both. Struve’s name is too Well known
and the Workers also know him. Comrade Starover thinks that a definite

tactical attitude.

{1}

The Congress adopted two resolutions on the question of the attitude to
the liberals: the first was motioned by Potresov (Starover), the second, by
Lenin, Plekhanov and 13 other delegates (for Plekhanov’s draft with Lenin’s
amendment see Lenin Miscellany VI, pp. 177–78).  

Lenin subsequently wrote: “The views of the old Iskra were
much better expressed in Plekhanov’s resolution, which emphasised the
anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian character of the liberal
Osvobozhdeniye, than in the confused resolution tabled by
Starover, which, on the one hand, aimed (quite inopportunely) at an
‘agreement’ with the liberals, and, on the other, stipulated for it
conditions that were manifestly unreal, being altogether impossible for the
liberals to fulfil” (see present edition, Vol. 7, p. 500).

{2}

Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation)—a fortnightly journal
published abroad from June 18 (July 1), 1902 to October 5 (18), 1905, under
the editorship of P. B. Struve. It was the organ of the Russian liberal
bourgeoisie and expounded the ideas of moderate-monarchist liberalism. In
1903 the Osvobozhdeniye League formed round the journal
(officially it came into existence in January 1904). The League existed
until October 1905. The followers of Osvobozhdeniye and the
Zemstvo constitutionalists made up the core of the
Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet) Party—the principal bourgeois party in
Russia, which was formed in October 1905.

The recent new law, the substance of which is stated in the
title of the article, and the law on shop-stewards, which we analysed in
the previous
issue,{1}

are rather typical specimens of the two trends in our labour legislation
expressive of this or that concession to the spirit of the times. Apart
from the aggressive reactionary laws of which we have a great abundance and
which manage to pass through all the bureaucratic ordeals with especial
rapidity, and which are moreover drawn up with especial thoroughness and
applied with especial vigour, all the other laws in Russia relating to the
working class may be classified under two heads, depending on their
political character. These are either laws which in any way, even by a
hair’s breadth, extend the workers’ independence, initiative and rights, in
which case the laws are hedged with hundreds and thousands of exemptions,
reservations, circular-letter explanations

    

and restrictions, all of which lead—as our draft programme puts it—to
the “extension or consolidation of tutelage of the working classes by the
police and officials”. Such are the laws on shop-stewards, factory
inspection in general, etc. Or these are laws expressing a concession which
has no bearing on citizens’ independence and initiative—in which case the
autocratic government comes forward with incomparably greater
generosity. And that is how it should be, of course, from the standpoint of
the autocracy’s general tactics, from the standpoint of police interests,
“correctly construed”. The policy of the police state has long been
called that of the whip and carrot by West-European democrats, who have had
all sorts of experience in fighting it. The carrot is the sops to the
revolutionary classes, the economic concessions designed to sow discord
within these classes, to win over a section of them and make it believe in
the bourgeois government’s sincerity and friendly attitude to the
proletariat. The whip is the police harassment of all those who have no
trust in the government and sow mistrust among others; the whip is keeping
in check all those who want complete freedom and independence for the
working class, for its unions, for its meetings, for its newspapers, and
for its political institutions and organs.  

The law on shop-stewards gives the workers representation which
could serve them against the bourgeoisie and the
government. Accordingly, the representation is so distorted and restricted
as to enable only, or at any rate mainly, spies to benefit from
it. Accordingly, in actual fact, what remains of workers’ representation,
as proclaimed by the law, is the collar, as in the case of Trishka’s
caftan. And that is needed to collar the ill-starred shop-steward and drag
him off to the police station. On the other hand, the law on compensation
for workers does not affect their political initiative in any way and,
consequently, on that score there can be greater generosity. There it is
less dangerous to act the “reformer”—and the need to act is
imperative, because the growing labour movement is looming in an
ever more formidable manner. The bureaucratic machine started its work on a
bill on employers’ responsibility twenty years ago. It took ten
years to draw up the bill; finally, it was approved by a special commission
and in

    

1893 it was promulgated and placed before the State
Council{2}... only to be pigeon-holed once again for another ten years!
It seemed quite impossible to make haste any slower than that, and the bill
would possibly have roamed the ministries and the chancellories for another
decade or so had not the onslaught by the working class of Russia shaken up
the whole of the autocracy.  

Finally, and at long last, the bill, repeatedly worsened in many
respects, has become law. For an assessment, let us compare it with the
demand in our draft Party programme:
in fact its “labour section” should be a guide in our work of agitation
and propaganda. Nothing but a comparison of the separate points and demands
of our programme with present-day reality and the attempts on the part of
the ruling classes to reform it without giving anyone offence, will enable
us, on the one hand, to give ourselves and the masses a fuller and more
concrete understanding of the meaning and significance of our programme;
and on the other, to see the defects of the laws in force; it will also
help us to see in practice, from the facts, to what extent any reform is
doomed to produce paltry results if the basis of the bourgeois system is
retained.  

Our draft programme (§ 7 of the “labour section”) demands that
the law should establish the employers’ civil liability in general
(for workers’ injuries and disease), which means anyone who employs
workers, anyone who derives profit from the unpaid labour of others, making
use of their labour-power, but not being held liable for the destruction or
damage of this commodity (labour-power) when in
operation. However, the new law relates exclusively to workers and
employees “in enterprises of the factory and works, mining and
metallurgical industries”. Consequently, all agricultural workers,
handicraftsmen, builders, artisans and so on and so forth are
excluded. This means the exclusion of the vast majority of wage-labourers,
who often work in even worse and more dangerous conditions; for example,
building and agricultural workers operating machines suffer from injuries
as much as, if not more than, factory workers. How is this exemption to be
explained? The answer is that outside factories and works the shoe does not
yet pinch so badly: so far the labour movement has made a formidable

    

showing only among the leading sections of the proletariat, and it is only
in this sphere that the government has shown “concern” (not for the
workers, of course, but for their suppression). But the proletariat, that
part of it which participates in the movement, that is, the class-conscious
proletariat, does not struggle for the benefit and advantages of some
single section of the workers, but for the whole class, for all
the classes oppressed by the capitalist system. This brings out very well
the difference between the reforms which the proletariat seeks, and the
reforms which the government hands out as sops.  

Furthermore, the new law binds the owners of enterprises to pay
compensation to workers only for the loss of capacity for work, “due
to bodily injury caused by operations in the production of the
enterprise or arising in consequence of such operations”. Our programme
demands the establishment of liability not only for disability caused by
accidents, but also by hazardous working conditions. Consequently,
once again the new law narrows down the employers’ liability. Everyone
knows that masses of workers are disabled not by accidents alone, not by
bodily injury, but by the diseases caused by the hazardous working
conditions. Unless the employers are held liable for the workers’
disability through disease, no amount of rules or instructions will do any
good in the struggle against these hazardous conditions. Indeed let us
consider what difference there is in substance between the accident in
which a machine cuts off a worker’s leg and the case of a worker who is
poisoned by phosphorus, lead, dyes, etc. Has not medical science already
created a whole department of occupational diseases whose origins have been
traced to hazardous working conditions and proved as surely as twice two is
four? However the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois government are not guided
by logic or common sense, but by gross self-interest: accidents will cost
them less than bodily injuries plus disease arising from hazardous
conditions. And the whole point, for them, is not to “provide security”
for the workers but to pay less.  

The new law releases the worker from the onus of proving that the
disability has occurred through the fault of the capitalist. That is
undoubtedly a step forward from the

    

past. But—the Russian Government is unable to take a step forward
anywhere without a “but”!—but to make up for that, employers may prove
not only ill intent on the part of the victim himself, but also “gross
carelessness on his (victim’s) part, unwarranted by the dispatch of
operations”. This addition largely paralyses the establishment of
real liability and—given the packing of our courts by officials,
careerists and bourgeois pedants—can paralyse the application of the law
altogether. “Gross carelessness” is something quite vague and
indefinable. It is entirely up to the officials to decide in what
conditions and to what extent gross carelessness is or is not
warranted. The capitalists have always regarded and will always regard any
“carelessness” on the worker’s part as gross and unwarranted, and will
always be able to muster ten times more witnesses and “learned counsel”
than the workers to prove their point (legal counsel are already being paid
annual fees by the factories!). The writing of this whole point on gross
carelessness into the law is a crass concession to the manufacturer’s
profit urge: the workers never get caught in the machine by preference, but
always by mishap, but the fact is that you can’t be careful when
working ten or eleven hours a day among badly screened machines, in poorly
lit shops, amid the din and roar, with your wits dulled by the work, and
with your nerves on edge because of excessive tension. That being so, to
deprive a disabled worker of compensation because of gross carelessness is
to penalise him additionally for permitting the capitalists their
unscrupulous exploitation.  

These points provide the basic and most important definitions of the
new law, fully delineating its essence. We cannot, of course, deal here
with all the particulars, but let us look only at the most characteristic
ones. The amount of the compensation is determined in proportion to the
victim’s annual earnings, namely, the pension must not be in excess of
two-thirds of his annual earnings (in the event of death or total
disability). The annual earnings are determined on the basis of the average
daily wage (or the average daily wage of an unskilled worker)
multiplied by 260. This provision contains another three
reductions in the size of compensation, three endorsements of the

    

employers’ profit urge. First, even if the worker has worked 300 days in
the year, his annual earnings are cut down to 260 days—without any
grounds, simply because the law commands that they should be cut! Second,
even if the worker has been earning more than an unskilled worker, the
calculation—involving work, say, at enterprises running part of the
year—is still based on the earnings of an unskilled worker. The
government would very much like to reduce all workers to the status of
unskilled workers—hence the lesson for the class-conscious proletariat,
that only the close unity of all workers and all unskilled workers together
can create a force capable of overcoming capital’s profit urge. Third, the
unskilled worker’s average daily wage is determined once in three years
(sic!) by the offices for factory, mining and metallurgical affairs,
without, need we say, any of the workers participating. That is not their
business, for who can doubt that the chancellories of the governor and the
chief of gendarmes have an excellent knowledge of how the workers live and
what they earn.  

Let us note, too, that the law binds the owners of enterprises to
notify the police immediately only about accidents which fall within the
compass of the law. Which are they? They are those involving disability for
more than three days. But who can tell just after an accident for
how many days the worker has been disabled? This rule is ridiculously
absurd and in many cases merely provides the manufacturers with a loophole
for divesting themselves (and being divested by the courts) of the duty of
informing the authorities of every accident. It is true that the law
decrees that the victim may demand notification of the police of all
cases of bodily injury without exception, even where they do
not fall under the law: that is said in so many words in § 20 of
the “rules on compensation payable to injured workers”, and we strongly
advise all workers to campaign in every way for the constant application of
this paragraph without fail. Let the workers insist that everyone injured
should always demand unconditionally, on the strength of § 20, that
the factory inspector be notified of every accident; only then
will it be possible to determine to any precise extent the number of
accidents occurring and to study their causes. We are sure that the
class-conscious

    

workers will make use of this right, but then great masses will not even be
aware that such a right is open to them!  

For failure to notify the police of accidents and in general for any
failure to observe the rules of the new law the owners of enterprises are
subject only to a cash fine of from 25 to 100 rubles. That is, of course,
an absolutely negligible fine, which is not at all a dreadful one for the
large factories (which employ the vast majority of factory workers). This
case makes especially clear the necessity of implementing §14 of our
draft programme, which demands “the establishment of criminal
responsibility for employers for breaches of labour protection laws”. It
is a mockery of the worker to threaten millionaires with 100-ruble fines
for non-observance of a law on which depends the Security of a worker
disabled for life.  

Par. 31, which entitles injured workers and their families to enter
into agreement with the owners of enterprises concerning the type and
amount of compensation payable to them, is one of the most pernicious and
Jesuitical points of the new law. Need we say that the vast majority of
these agreements will amount to systematic fraud and intimidation of the
least developed workers who are sure of only one thing, namely, that
Russian courts are biased, bureaucratic and expensive. Factory inspectors,
who are to witness these agreements (equivalent to settlements out of
court), will safeguard anyone’s interests but those of the workers.  

The factory inspectors, who are now being increasingly turned into mere
assistants of the police, play the part of “reconcilers”. What is more,
it is the intention of the law to turn them into a peculiar category of
magistrates. The law encourages employers and workers to apply to factory
inspectors in clearing up the rights and duties of the parties, with the
factory inspectors being empowered both to collect “all the necessary
information” and to demand its submission to the parties, and to invite
doctors for certification. This is already purely judicial business and it
is assigned to officials under the governor! What is more, no procedure, no
rules governing this court have been laid down: how the inspector is to
collect the information, how he is—and is he at all—to submit this
information to both parties, how he is to conduct the examination—all
that is left entirely

    

up to him. This is something positively like the police courts of the
pre-Reform period. The law even holds out the threat of a deprivation for
failure to apply to the factory constable (in his capacity as magistrate):
those who fail to apply to the factory inspector before going to court,
lose their right to receive court and legal costs from the defendant.  

It remains for us only to give another reminder at this point that the
Social-Democratic Labour Party does not demand courts of that kind, not
mediation by officials, but the establishment of industrial courts on which
employers and workers are equally represented. That is the only kind of
court, given a free political system in the state, that can assure the
workers of anything like satisfactory mediation in the business of
elucidating the rights and duties of the parties, and in the preliminary
examination of claims involving disability compensation. There are such
courts in all civilised states, and as long as 40 years ago even
Russian officials used to propose their introduction in Russia. Forty years
ago, a commission was appointed to revise the factory and handicraft
regulations. The commission has published its “transactions”, five
volumes of them; the commission has written the drafts of new regulations;
the commission has come out in favour of setting up industrial courts
consisting of elected representatives—and... and the whole thing has been
shelved! Heaps of good intentions are stacked up in the archives of
innumerable offices in Russia, and will continue to be there until the
working class gives all this rubbish a shake-up.

The State Council—one of the higher state bodies in
pre-revolutionary Russia. Set up in 1810 on a proposal by M. M. Speransky
as a consultative and legislative institution whose members were

   

appointed and confirmed by the tsar. It was reorganised by the law of
February 20 (March 5), 1906, and was given the right to approve or reject
bills after the debate in the Duma, but the tsar retained the power to
amend the fundamental laws and issue some of the more important ones.  

From 1906, one half of the State Council consisted of elected
representatives of the gentry, the clergy and the big bourgeoisie, and the
other from the senior civil servants appointed by the tsar. This made it a
highly reactionary institution which rejected even the moderate bills
adopted by the Duma.

1
 REMARKS ON THE AGENDA 
 OCTOBER 13 (26) 
1

There is no point in limiting the deliberations on the
Rules beforehand. This is to be a new set of rules and, consequently, the
words “working out the Rules” may be left
in.{3} 
    

2

I need more than an hour for my report. I can, of course, fold it up,
but I believe that that is not in the interests of the assembly. I request
the chairman to ask the Congress for its opinion. Will it give me more time
or must I cut down my report?  
3

The League has elected two delegates. Comrade Martov has
resigned, and I am now the only authorised delegate. Since there is no
longer any time limitation on speeches, I do not understand the meaning of
Martov’s
proposal.{4} There are many here who attended the Congress, and I think
we may have not one co-report, but a whole series of them.

PREFATORY REMARK TO THE REPORT ON THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R.S.D.L.P.


OCTOBER 13 (26) 

I did indeed ask the assembly myself, and no one stopped
me. I think that it is quite all right to talk freely about
everything. There is a tremendous difference between private conversations
and the meetings of the Iskra organisation. At any rate, let the
meeting express its views. I shall not speak of the private meetings of the
Iskra organisation until the League finds it necessary for me to
do so.

3
 STATEMENT CONCERNING MARTOV’S REPORT 
 OCTOBER 16 (29) 

I declare that now that Martov’s so-called co-report
yesterday has given an undignified turn to the debate I consider it
unnecessary and impossible to take part in any debates on this point of the
=

     Tagesordnung{1}

and, consequently, also waive my summing-up speech, especially in view of
the fact that if Martov has the courage to make definite and open charges,
he must do so before the whole Party in a pamphlet which in my formal
challenge yesterday I suggested he should
write.{5}

4
 SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE LEAGUE RULES 
 OCTOBER 17 (30) 
1

There is no need to object at length to these
arguments.{6} § 6 gives the right to organise and consequently to
reorganise as
well,{7} and a reorganised League will still be the same League, the
only Party organisation abroad.  
2

To Comrade Martov’s question about whether or not functionaries should
be confirmed by the Central Committee, I reply that I see no obstacles to
the elected administrative officers being approved by the Central
Committee.

5
 SPEECH ON THE RESULT OF THE VOTING OF THE RESOLUTIONS ON THE LEAGUE
RULES 
OCTOBER 17 (30)

...Lenin declares on his own behalf and on behalf of the
comrades who voted with him that he regards the rejection of Comrade
Konyagin’s resolution and the adoption of Comrade Martov’s resolution as a
crying violation of the Party
Rules.{8} (“Which paragraph of the Rules specifically does the vote
contradict?”) I refuse to answer such questions, because this has been
sufficiently well clarified in the course of the debate. (“State the
paragraph of the Rules which the resolution we have adopted contradicts.”)
It is up to the Party’s central institutions to interpret the Rules; and
that is what they will do.

Agenda.—Ed.  
 



{2}

The Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
Social-Democracy Abroad was held at Geneva from October 13 to 18
(26–31), 1903. It was called at the insistence of the Mensheviks who
wanted to oppose it to the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin objected
to its convocation and wrote: “A League Congress now will
generate more heat than light, i.e., it will contribute nothing to the work
abroad”

(see present edition, Vol. 34, p. 176).



The congress of the League was attended by 15 supporters of the
majority led by Lenin (14 from the second sitting), who had 18 votes, and
by 18 Mensheviks (19 from the second sitting) with 22 votes. The congress
discussed the following questions: 1) report by the administration of the
League Abroad; 2) report by the League’s delegate at the Second Party
Congress; 3) the League’s Rules; 4) elections of the administration.  

The central question of the agenda was a report by Lenin, who had been
the League’s delegate at the Party Congress. He described the work of the
Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and exposed the opportunism of the
Mensheviks, showing their unprincipled behaviour at the Congress. (For
Lenin’s report and speeches see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 69–85.)
Taking advantage of their majority at the League congress, the opposition
decided to have Martov as a co-rapporteur. Martov spoke out in defence of
the Mensheviks’ behaviour at the R.S.D.L.P. Second Congress and made
slanderous accusations against the Bolsheviks. Realising that it was futile
and impossible to continue the polemic the opposition, Lenin and the
supporters of the majority congress and refused to take part in any further
debates on this question. The Menshevik majority at the congress, in an
effort to secure the Party’s central bodice, adopted three resolutions on
the second item of the agenda, in which it opposed Lenin’s approach to
organisational questions and called for sustained struggle against the
Bolsheviks.  

The congress also adopted the League’s Rules, some of which were aimed
against the Party Rules (such as publication of general Party literature
under the League’s auspices, relations between the League’s administration
and other organisations, bypassing the C.C. and the C.O.); the Mensheviks
also contested the right of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee to approve the
League’s Rules.  F. V. Lengnik, the representative of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee who attended the congress, demanded on behalf
of the Central Committee that the League’s Rules should be brought

   

into line with the Party Rules, and when the opposition refused to do so,
declared the assembly invalid and walked out. The Party Council approved of
his action

(see p. 107 of this volume).



Lenin said that the congress of the League was the “climax of the
opposition’s campaign against the central bodies” (see present edition,
Vol. 7, p. 123). After the League’s Second Congress, the Mensheviks turned
it into a stronghold in their fight against the Party.  

The “Preparatory Material” section in Vol. 41 of the Fifth Russian
edition of Lenin’s Collected Works contains two relevant
documents: an outline-plan of Lenin’s report on the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. at the League congress, and Lenin’s notes at the first sitting
of the League congress.

p. 104





{3}

This is in reply to L. G. Deutsch’s proposal on item 3 of the agenda:

substitute “amendment of the Rules” for “working out the Rules”. The
working out of a new set of rules for the League was a question of
principle. The League’s old Rules (1901), drawn up at a time when the Party
was not yet a single whole, no longer met the new demands. The Party Rules
adopted at the Second R.S.D.L.P. Congress gave the League the same rights
as the Party committees, with the exception, however, that it could support
the Russian revolutionary movement only through persons and groups
specially appointed by the Central Committee (see K.P.S.S. v
rezolutsiyakh resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsii i plenumov TsK,
Part I, 1954, p. 47). In his consistent efforts to have the decisions of
the Second R.S.D.L.P. Congress implemented, Lenin demanded the working put
of a new set of rules for the League in accordance with the Party Rules.

A reference to Trotsky’s efforts, with the aid of various sophisms and
arbitrary interpretations of the Party Rules, to show that the League
Abroad was empowered to approve the draft of the League’s Rules the
congress was debating, independently of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.

p. 106





{7}

A reference to § 6 of the R.S.D.L.P. Rules adopted by the Party’s
Second Congress (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov,

p. 106





{8}

The resolution motioned by L.Y. Galperin (Konyagin), which the
Bolsheviks supported, said that the League Rules would enter into force
upon their approval by the Central Committee. This resolution was drawn up
in accordance with the R.S.D.L.P. Rules and safeguarded the principles of
democratic centralism in the Party.  


Martov’s resolution, adopted by the opportunist majority of the League
congress, was based on the assumption that the League had the right to
adopt its own Rules without preliminary approval by the Party Central
Committee.

the question of the measures which could help to restore peace in the Party
and normal relations between members of the Party who do not see eye to
eye.

insists that his resolution should be put to the vote
first{2} and refers to the existing custom giving voting priority to the
resolution which was motioned earlier.  
2

The right of introducing minority opinions has always been
recognised as a part of the order of business. Comrade Martov made an
attempt to separate the general from the
particular.{3} I quite agree with this, but I merely give a somewhat
different wording to his proposal.

 SPEECH CONCERNING THE MINORITY OPINION ENTERED BY THE
C. C. REPRESENTATIVES 
 JANUARY 17 (30) 

A rule has been established in the practice of all
congresses in virtue of which those voting have the right to record their
minority opinions. Of course, every minority opinion is essentially a kind
of criticism. But this circumstance did not, after all, prevent the entry
at the Second Congress of a minority opinion issued by the Bund
representatives, an opinion which was the sharpest kind of criticism
levelled at the decision adopted by the Congress. Our minority opinion sets
out the motives for which we opposed Comrade Plekhanov’s proposal and in
general our attitude to this proposal. It is the more necessary to read out
this minority opinion because at the end of it there is a motivated
statement to the effect that we withdraw our resolution.

JANUARY 17 (30)

I resolutely protest against the idea that our minority
opinion contained any accusations levelled at the Council. Such an
interpretation is entirely wrong and Comrade Martov’s attempt is an
encroachment on our freedom of expression; his resolution is therefore
unwarranted.{4}

 REMARK ON THE AGENDA 
 JANUARY 17 (30) 

The representatives of the C.C. would like to move several other small
points for discussion, but I request that the question of convening a Party
congress should be placed on the order paper beforehand.

 DRAFT RESOLUTION MOVED ON JANUARY 17 (30) 

The Party Council considers it improper for the
representatives of the C.O. Editorial Board to communicate to the Secretary
of the C.O. Comrade Vasilyev’s opinion of him, because this opinion was
submitted to the members of the Council only, being a part of the meetings
within the Party’s supreme body.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The R.S.D.L.P. Council, which met at Geneva from January 15
(28) to 17 (30), 1904, was “called on the initiative of the
C.O. representatives for the purpose of discussing measures to co-ordinate
the activity of the C.C. and the C.O. in the publication of Party
literature” (Lenin Miscellany X, p. 181—minutes of the
Council’s sittings). The Council’s sittings were attended by V. I. Lenin,
F. V. Lengnik, 0. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod and L. Martov.  

On a motion by Lenin, the Party Council decided to include in the
agenda and to discuss first the question of measures to restore peace in
the Party. On behalf of the Central Committee, Lenin motioned a draft
resolution on the question on January 15 (28) (see present edition, Vol. 7,
pp. 147–49). When the debate showed the Mensheviks’ negative attitude to
the resolution, Lenin and Lengnik motioned another draft resolution on
restoring peace in the Party on January 16 (29) (see p. 109), which was
adopted by the Council by three votes (Lenin, Lengnik and Plekhanov) to two
(Martov and Axelrod). But instead of proceeding to a concrete discussion of
the question of restoring peace in the Party, the Council, over Lenin’s
protest, went to vote Plekhanov’s resolution demanding the co-optation of
the Mensheviks to the Central Committee. The resolution was adopted by the
votes of Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod. Accordingly, the
C.C. representatives (Lenin and Lengnik) entered a minority opinion on
January 17 (30) censuring Plekhanov’s resolution which ignored the will of
the majority at the Party’s Second Congress. The minority opinion was
written by Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 150–53).  

When the Mensheviks had frustrated every effort to establish peace in
the Party, Lenin motioned a draft resolution on the convocation of the
Party’s Third Congress as the only way out of the situation (see present
edition, Vol. 7, p. 154). By the votes of Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod,
this resolution was rejected and one by Martov against the convocation of
the Party congress adopted.  

Nor was any agreement reached between the representatives of the
C.C. and the Mensheviks on the publication of Party literature. The Party
Council rejected the resolutions on this question motioned by Lenin and
adopted the resolutions approving of the factional and disorganising
activity of the Editorial Board of the Menshevik Iskra.  

The Council’s January sittings showed that with Plekhanov’s switch to
the Mensheviks’ side, the R.S.D.L.P. Council became an instrument in the
Menshevik fight against the Party.

p. 108





{2}

A reference to the draft resolution on measures to restore peace in the
Party. Lenin insisted that his resolution should be put

   

to the vote before Plekhanov’s, who was proposing the co-optation of
Mensheviks to the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.

p. 108





{3}

A reference to Martov’s speech on the voting of the resolutions
motioned by Lenin and by Plekhanov. While admitting that Lenin had the
legitimate right to demand that his resolution should be voted on first,
Martov nevertheless proposed the following change in the approach to the
question: 1) Is it necessary to issue a call to all the members of the
Party? 2) Plekhanov’s concrete proposal.

p. 108





{4}

Martov’s resolution was aimed against the minority opinion entered on
January 17 (30), 1904, by the C.C. representatives Lenin and Lengnik over
the Party Council’s resolution motioned by Plekhanov on the co-optation of
Mensheviks to the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee

(see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 150–53).

In his resolution Martov proposed that Lenin and Lengnik should be censured
for entering their minority opinion. In the course of the debate that
followed, Martov was forced to withdraw his resolution and to adhere to
Plekhanov’s resolution, which was somewhat different in form, and which was
adopted by the Menshevik votes.

We whole-heartedly welcome the excellent idea of the
“Group of Founders” to set up a library and archives of the Central
Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, and earnestly
request all comrades and all those sympathising with this long overdue
measure to give every possible assistance to our comrades who have under
taken the effort in organising this complex and important business.

Notes
 
 



{1}

This was written by Lenin in connection with the decision by the
“Group of Founders” to set up a library and archives of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee at Geneva. Together with the appeal of the
“Group of Founders” for assistance in organising the Party library and
archives, it was published in p leaflet “To One and All” (put out by the
Party printing-press in Geneva).  

On February 7 (20), 1904, Lenin, as a member of the R.S.D.L.P. Central
Committee, signed the “Regulations of the Library and Archives of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee” (the document is written in
V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich’s hand).  

Later Lenin wrote the “Statement by the Group of Founders of the
R.S.D.L.P. Library at Geneva” on the transfer of the R.S.D.L.P. library to
the Majority Committees’ Bureau (see p. 136). The next sitting of the
M.C.B., on Lenin’s motion, confirmed the members of the earlier “Group of
Founders” as the supervisory committee of the library and archives of the
R.S.D.L.P. A report on this committee’s activity was submitted to the Party
Congress (see Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P. Protokoly, Moscow, 1959,
pp. 533–37). The library was in existence for 13 years, until the February
1917 revolution. At present, the collections of the library and the
archives of the R.S.D.L.P. are at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee.

The war is on. The Japanese have already inflicted a series
of defeats on the Russian troops, and the tsarist government is now
straining every nerve to avenge itself for these defeats. Military
districts are being mobilised one after another, and tens of thousands of
soldiers are being hastily dispatched to the Far East; desperate efforts
are being made abroad to secure another loan, and contractors have been
promised bonuses running to thousands of rubles a day for accelerating the
works required by the war department. The people’s every fibre is put to
the greatest strain because the struggle that has been started is no
trifling matter; it is a struggle against a 50-million-strong people who
are splendidly armed, splendidly prepared for the war, and who are fighting
for the conditions which they believe to be urgently necessary for free
national development. This is going to be a struggle by a despotic and back
ward government against a people that is politically free and is rapidly
progressing in culture. The war against the sickly Turkey in 1877 and 1878,
which exacted such a high

    

price from the Russian people, was negligible when compared to the war now
started.


What in that case is at issue in the life-and-death struggle now being waged by
the Russian workers and peasants against the Japanese? The issue is
“Yellow Russia”, the issue is Manchuria and Korea, the new lands
seized by the Russian Government. It had promised all the other powers to
preserve the inviolability of China, it had promised to return Manchuria to
China not later than October 8, 1903, and it had failed to honour its
promise. The tsarist government had so run away with itself in its policy of
military adventures and plunder of its neighbours that it found no strength to
go back. In “Yellow Russia” it has built fortifications and ports,
it has laid a railway line and has concentrated tens of thousands of troops.


But how do the Russian people benefit from these new lands whose acquisition has
cost so much blood and sacrifice and is bound to cost even more? For the Russian
worker and peasant the war holds out the prospect of fresh calamities, the loss
of a host of human lives, the ruin of a mass of families, and more burdens and
taxes. The Russian army leadership and the tsarist government believe that the
war holds out the promise of military glory. The Russian merchant and the
millionaire-industrialist think the war is necessary to secure new marketing
outlets for their goods and new ports in an unrestricted ice-free sea for the
development of Russian trade. You can’t sell much at home to the starving
muzhik and the unemployed worker, you must look for marketing outlets in foreign
lands! The riches of the Russian bourgeoisie have been created by the
impoverishment and the ruin of the Russian workers—and so now, in order
to multiply
these riches, the workers must shed their blood to give the Russian bourgeoisie
a free hand in conquering and enslaving the Chinese and the Korean
working man.


This criminal war, which holds in store immense calamities for the working
people, has been engendered by the interests of the greedy bourgeoisie, the
interests of capital, which is prepared to sell and ruin its own country in its
drive for profit. This hazardous gamble involving the blood and property of
Russian citizens is the result of the policy

    

of a despotic government which tramples all human rights and keeps its people in
servitude. In response to the wild war-cries, in response to the
“patriotic” flag-waving by the flunkeys of the money-bag and the
lackeys of the police-whip, the class-conscious Social-Democratic proletariat
must come forward and demand with tenfold energy: “Down with the
autocracy!”, “Let a people’s constituent assembly be convened!”


The tsarist government has plunged so deep into this reckless military gamble
that it has at stake a great deal too much. Even in the event of success, the
war against Japan threatens total exhaustion of the people’s forces—with
the results of the victory being absolutely negligible, for the other
powers will prevent Russia from enjoying the fruits of victory as they prevented
Japan from doing so in
1895.{2} In the event of defeat, the war will lead above
all to the collapse of the entire government system based on popular
ignorance and deprivation, on oppression and violence.


They who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind!


Long live the fraternal union of the proletarians of all countries fighting for
complete liberation from the yoke of international capital! Long live Japanese
Social-Democracy protesting against the war! Down with the ignominious and
predatory tsarist autocracy!


Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

This was written by Lenin a week after the outbreak of the Russo
Japanese War and was circulated to the Party committees in a number of
cities in Russia with instructions to have it immediately reprinted and
spread. N. K. Krupskaya informed I. Kh. Lalayants, L. B. Krasin and
L. M. Knipovich about the dispatch of the leaflet in her letters on
February 3 (18) and 4 (17), 1904 (Archives of the

   

Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee and
Lenin Miscellany X, pp. 323, 324). On February 16 (29), 1904, she
wrote to R. S. Zemlyachka and L. Y. Galperin: “Stank
(V.I. Lenin.—Ed.) has written a leaflet about the war; it was
not distributed here, and was sent for reprinting in Tomsk, Moscow, Odessa,
St. Petersburg, Samara, Saratov, Nizhny Novgorod and Yekaterinoslav”
(Central State Historical Archives in Moscow). At the library of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism there are many copies of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee’s leaflet “To the Russian Proletariat”:
there are copies bearing the seal of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, the
seals of the Moscow and Yekaterinoslav committees of the R.S.D.L.P.; the
leaflet was reprinted and distributed by the Nizhny Novgorod (7,700
copies), Tver and Saratov committees, and by students in Kiev. In addition,
it was reprinted in Iskra No. 61 on March 5 (18), 1904.

Following the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the 1895 Treaty of
Shimonoseki forced China to cede the Liaotung Peninsula and the islands of
Penghuletao (Pescadores) and Taiwan to Japan, to undertake to pay an
indemnity of 200 million hang (subsequently increased to 230 million hang)
and to grant Japan a number of economic privileges. Fearful of Japan’s
growing strength, Russia, France and Germany issued a protest over the
Treaty of Shimonoseki and this forced Japan to abandon the idea of annexing
the Liaotung Peninsula.

These outlines were the basis of a report on the Paris Commune given by
Lenin at Geneva on March 9 (22), 1904. They were written after a thorough
study of Karl Marx’s The Civil War in France (see Marx and Engels,
Selected Works, Vol. I, Moscow, 1962, pp. 473–545). All of
Lenin’s references are to the Berlin edition of 1891. He also makes use of
Lissagaray’s History of the Commune of 1871 and Weill’s
History of the Social Movement in France (1852–1902).


On the basis of these outlines Lenin wrote a “Plan of a Lecture on the
Commune” in 1905 (see p resent edition, Vol. 5, pp. 206–08). He returned
again and again to the Paris Commune (see, for instance, the articles
“Lessons of the Commune” and “In Memory of the Commune”, and
Chapter III of the book The State and Revolution—present
edition, Vol. 13, pp. 475–78, Vol. 17, pp. 139–43, Vol. 25, pp. 413–32).

I.A.A. (Internationale Arbeiter Association)—the
International Working Men’s Association (First International)—the first
inter national mass organisation of the proletariat set up at an
international workers’ meeting in London called by British and French
workers in 1864. Karl Marx was the organiser and leader of the First
International, and wrote its Inaugural Address, Rules and other programme
and tactical documents. The establishment of the First International was
the result of long and persistent efforts

   

by Marx and Engels to organise a working-class revolutionary party. Lenin
said that the First International “laid the foundation of an international
organisation of the workers for the preparation of their revolutionary
attack on capital” and “laid the foundation of the proletarian
international struggle for socialism” (see present edition, Vol. 29,
pp. 306, 307).  

The central governing body of the First International was its General
Council, of which Karl Marx was a member throughout. He did a great deal to
overcome the petty-bourgeois influences and sectarian tendencies which then
prevailed in the labour movement (trade unionism in Britain, Proudhonism
and anarchism in Romance countries and Lassalleanism in Germany) and
rallied the advanced workers in Europe and America round the principles of
scientific socialism. The First International directed the economic and
political struggle of workers in various countries and strengthened their
international solidarity. It also played a great part in spreading Marxism
and introducing socialism into the working-class movement.  

After the defeat of the Paris Commune, the working class was faced with
the task of setting up mass national parties on the basis of the principles
put forward by the First International. In 1873 Marx wrote: “As I view
European conditions it is quite useful to let the formal organisation of
the International recede into the background for the time being” (see
Marx’s letter to F. A. Sorge, September 27, 1873) (Marx and Engels,
Selected Correspondence, Moscow, 1965, p. 286). The First
International was officially dissolved at the Philadelphia Conference in
1876.

Proudhonism—an unscientific, anti-Marxist trend of
petty-bourgeois socialism named after the French anarchist Proudhon. Marx
and Engels waged a consistent struggle against Proudhon’s attempts to
impose his views on the First International. Proudhonism was subjected to
withering criticism by Marx in The Poverty of Philosophy. The
resolute struggle conducted by Marx, Engels and their supporters against
Proudhonism within the First International ended in the full triumph of
Marxism over Proudhonism.  

Lenin said Proudhonism was the “stupidity of the petty bourgeois and
the philistine”, incapable of accepting the working-class
standpoint. Proudhonist ideas have been widely used by bourgeois
“theorists” to advocate class collaboration.

p. 114





{9}

Blanquism—a trend in the French socialist movement led by
the outstanding revolutionary and prominent French utopian Communist, Louis
Auguste Blanqui (1805–1881).  

Lenin wrote that the Blanquists hoped “that mankind will be
emancipated from wage slavery, not by the proletarian class struggle, but
through a conspiracy hatched by a small minority of intellectuals” (see
present edition, Vol. 10, p. 392). They substituted action by a secret
group of plotters for the activity of a revolutionary party, failed to take
account of the concrete situation

   

in which an uprising could be victorious, and neglected to maintain ties
with the masses.

artillery division General Susane that he could take his

of firing off the guns. This letter, published by the Commune in No. 115 of
Journal Officiel de la République FranÃ§aise (Official
Journal of the French Republic) on April 25, 1871, showed that the
“government of national defence” merely pretended that it was defending

The expression “ticket-of-leave men” was used by Marx in The
Civil War in France where he says the following about Thiers’
ministers: “These men, then, could find, in the ruins of Paris only, their
tickets-of-leave: they were the very men Bismarck wanted.... In England
common criminals are often discharged on parole after serving the greater
part of their term, and are placed under police surveillance. On such
discharge they receive a certificate called ticket-of-leave, their
possessors being referred to as ticket-of-leave men” (see Marx and Engels,

REMARK ON THE AGENDA 

MAY 31 (JUNE 13) 

L e n i n

motions the addition to the list of items on the agenda of the question
raised by the Polish Socialist Party (P.P.S.) concerning the desirability
of calling a conference of R.S.D.L.P. and P.P.S. representatives to discuss
the basis and terms of joint struggle by the two parties.

SPEECHES ON AN INTER-PARTY
CONFERENCE{2}

 MAY 31 (JUNE 13) 
1

I second the proposal to invite both Latvian
organisations.{3} As for the Armenian federalist
organisation,{4} there can be no question of inviting it to the
conference after what Comrade Martov has said about its intimacy with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Furthermore, I don’t quite see the point of
Comrade Plekhanov’s insistent proposal of the need for an immediate reply
to the Finns.  
2

I think it would be too much to demand unanimity in decisions on
questions of
principle.{5} I can’t see any of the Social-Democrats staying on if the
conference adopted some monstrous decision.

SPEECHES ON R.S.D.L.P. REPRESENTATION
AT THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONGRESS 
MAY 31 (JUNE 13)
1

I should like to have an explanation as to whether it is convenient to
send delegates both from the Council and from the individual
organisations. Are there any similar examples in the practice of other
countries at earlier congresses?  I think this mode of representation is
somewhat inconvenient in terms of both principle and practice (from the
financial, technical and other standpoints). Would it not be better for the
Council to be represented there in corpore? I don’t see hew we could be
victimised. After all, our Party can’t be deprived of its vote!  
2

Since Comrade Plekhanov says that we shall not be able to secure the
Party’s separate representation at the Congress, while the dispatch of a
large number of delegates to the Congress would cost a great deal, and
anyhow we shall not be able to match the Bundists in this respect, it would
be more dignified if the Council alone represented the Party at the
Congress.  
3

Moreover, we shall hardly have time to contact all the organisations to
obtain their
mandates.{6} In view of this, I motion that in case of necessity the
Council should, with out contacting the individual organisations, be
empowered to represent each of them separately....

 MOTION OF AMENDMENT TO MARTOV’S RESOLUTION ON THE RIGHT OF THE
C.O. AND THE C.C. TO RECALL THEIR REPRESENTATIVES  THE PARTY COUNCIL

 JUNE 5 (18) 

Comrade Martov remarked that he put forward his proposal regardless of
the concrete cases and merely to avoid conflicts in the future. That is why
I shall not refer to any concrete cases either and if the resolution is
designed exclusively to lay down a definite rule for the future, I shall
not argue against it. Perhaps it would be better to cut it down and reduce
it to the right of the collegium to recall its representatives, deleting
the sentence on non-responsibility to the Congress.

 SPEECH ON CO-OPTATION TO THE COMMITTEES AND ON THE C. C.’S RIGHT TO
APPOINT NEW MEMBERS 
 JUNE 5 (18) 

What Martov said was news to
me.{8} We have quite definite indications that the minority of the
Moscow Committee proposed the co-optation of one of its candidates,
without, however, connecting this question with factional

    

differences. Furthermore, speaking on the substance of the matter, I would
consider it more correct and more in the spirit of the Rules to regard
every fraction as a unit; nevertheless, this question is so insignificant
that I agree to vote for Comrade Martov’s resolution.

 SPEECHES ON THE VOTING PROCEDURE IN DECIDING THE QUESTION OF CONVENING
THE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE R.S.D.L.P. 
 JUNE 5 (18)
1

L e n i n

joins Glebov in regarding the votes of the Tver and the Riga committees as
invalid,{9} and proposes that the organisations should be regarded as
existing not since the issue of their proclamations but since their
confirmation by the C.C. In addition, he says, the reference to the date of
the Congress should be deleted from Martov’s resolution. The rules of the
leagues will determine how many votes they are to have at the
Congress. Until their rules are approved, everything should remain as it
was at the Second Congress. For example, the Caucasian
League{10} should have six votes.  
2

Comrade Martov and I essentially agree on the right of 9 committees in
voting on the Congress. The Baku Committee, I believe, should not have a
separate vote because it is a part of the Caucasian League. Inquiries
should be made about all the five leagues and then the relevant decisions
adopted.  
3

In substance I would have nothing against Comrade Martov’s proposal,
but it would be formally
wrong.{11} The Congress has not confirmed them and, consequently, they
should be subject to the rule that they may vote for or

    

against the Congress only after one year. There is the less reason to
discuss this, since the period has almost run out. But we should be very
careful about the Caucasian League:
they would be deeply mortified if we gave them only two votes instead of
the six they had. Moreover, I think that Comrade Martov tends to confuse
two points (e and f) of § 3 of the Rules, when he
proposes that leagues should be given the same status as committees. Thus,
I motion that we postpone the question of the Caucasian League and make
inquiries through the C.C.  
4

I join in Comrade Martov’s opinion concerning the Caucasian
League.{12} Then there is another juridical question of how the votes of
the Council are to be counted in a general count of the votes required for
the convocation of a congress. I think two interpretations would be
correct: either, in determining the required number of organisations, to
make the count without including the five votes of the Council in the
overall total of votes belonging to all the organisations, and then to
count each vote of the Council separately; or simply to take one-half of
the existing number of organisations, without the Council, and to reckon
this half as the number required in this case. I believe that it would be
most correct to count each of the Council’s votes separately.

 SPEECHES ON THE QUESTION OF PUBLISHING THE MINUTES OF THE PARTY
COUNCIL SITTINGS 
 JUNE 5 (18) 
1

I absolutely disagree with Comrade Martov. It is desirable to establish
for all the sittings of the Council the rule adopted on the minutes of the
last
sitting.{13} This publication will hardly be impeded by the requirements
of secrecy and it would be highly important for Party members to

    

know what is going on in the Party’s supreme body and the opinions which
are held there by both sides.  
2

I am very much surprised by Comrade Glebov’s raising the question of
the decision taken at the last sitting and his proposal to review it now. I
believe such a review is inadmissible, either formally or morally.  
3

No decision on their publication has yet been taken by the C.C. and I
merely insist on the C.C.’s right to take such a decision,
whenever it deems it necessary to do
so.{14}

Notes
 
 



{1}

The R.S.D.L.P Council met at Geneva on May 31 and June 5
(June 13 and 18), 1904, with V. I. Lenin, 0. V. Plekhanov (Chairman),
V. A. Noskov, P. B. Axelrod and L. Martov present. At its first sitting it
discussed the questions of calling an inter-party conference of
revolutionary and opposition organisations of Russia, and of the
forthcoming international congress at Amsterdam. The second sitting was
devoted to a discussion of internal Party questions: 1) the right of the
Party’s central bodies (C.C. and C.O.) to recall their representatives from
the Party Council; 2) co-optation to the committees and the Central
Committee’s right to seat new members on them; 3) procedure governing the
voting by Party organisations on the convocation of the Party’s Third
Congress; 4) publication of the minutes of Council sittings, etc.  

In view of the fact that three of the five Council members (Plekhanov,
Axelrod and Martov) represented the Menshevik opposition, while Noskov took
a conciliatory stand, the Party Council adopted Menshevik decisions on the
most important internal Party matters (for Lenin’s speeches at the
R.S.D.L.P. Council see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 435–44).

p. 122





{2}

The Inter-Party Conference of Opposition and Revolutionary
Organisations of Russia, called on the initiative of the Finnish Party
of Active Resistance, was held at the end of 1904. The representatives of
the R.S.D.L.P. and several other Social-Democratic parties and
organisations of Russia met at Amsterdam in August 1904, before the
International Socialist Congress opened, and decided not to attend the
inter-Party conference. For the R.S.D.L.P., this decision was approved by
the Party Council sitting on August 21 (September 3), 1904.

p. 122





{3}

The Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Organisation of the Baltic
Area was set up in April 1902 through the merger of several
Social-Democratic organisations. On its basis, the First Congress of
Latvian Social-Democratic Organisations, held from June 7 to 9 (20–22),
1904, set up the Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Party which joined the
R.S.D.L.P. at the Fourth (Unity) Congress in 1906.  

The Latvian Social-Democratic Union, set up in the autumn of
1900 abroad, was akin in its demands to the Russian
Socialist-Revolutionaries and was largely permeated with nationalistic
tendencies. In 1905, the Union gained some temporary influence among a
section of the peasants, but was soon ousted by the Latvian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Union subsequently played no noticeable
role of any kind.

p. 122





{4}

A reference to the Armenian Social-Democratic Labour
Organisation (Specifics), which was set up by Armenian
national-federalist elements soon after the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. Like the Bundists, the Specifics wanted the Party organised on
the

   

federal principle, which implied a division of the proletariat on national
lines, and declared themselves to be the sole representatives of the
Armenian proletariat. They tried to justify their nationalism by referring
to the “specific conditions of each nation”. In a letter to the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee over the conference of Social-Democratic
organisations in Russia called for September 1905, Lenin wrote: “I
strongly warn you against the Armenian Social-Democratic Federation. If you
have agreed to its participation in the conference, you have made a
fatal mistake, which must be rectified at all costs. It
is represented in Geneva by a couple of disrupters who publish sheer trivia
here and have no serious connections with the Caucasus. It is a
Bund creatura, nothing more, specially Invented to cultivate
Caucasian Bundism.... All the Caucasian comrades are against this gang of
disruptive writers...” (see present edition, Vol. 34, p. 337).

p. 122





{5}

A reference to Martov’s proposal at the first sitting of the Party
Council calling for the adoption of a resolution to have all decisions
involving principle, at the inter-party conference, adopted only
unanimously.

p. 122





{6}

A remark Lenin made in connection with Martov’s resolution inviting all
Party organisations to send to the Party Council their mandates for the
Amsterdam Congress of the Second International, and also to submit reports
on local activity for the drawing up of a general report. Martov was
followed by Plekhanov who said there was no time to wait for local reports
and proposed that someone should be asked to draw up a report right away.

p. 123





{7}

A reference to the newspaper Veratsnutyun (Renascence), organ
of the Gnchak, the Armenian petty-bourgeois nationalist party. It was
published in Rus&ccaronuk, Bulgaria, in 1903 and 1904.

p. 124





{8}

A reference to Martov’s assertion that the minority of the Moscow
Committee had proposed the co-optation not of one but of two of their
members.

p. 124





{9}

Under the Party Rules adopted by the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
only those organisations which had been confirmed not less than a year
before the congress enjoyed the right of representation on it. On the
strength of this, V. A. Noskov (Glebov) said at the second sitting of the
Party Council that the votes of the Tver and Riga committees were invalid
in deciding on the convocation of the Party’s Third Congress.

p. 125





{10}

The Caucasian League of the R.S.D.L.P. was set up at the First
Congress of Caucasian Social-Democratic Organisations at Tiflis in March
1903, on the initiative of the Tiflis and the Baku commit tees of the
R.S.D.L.P. It was attended by 15 delegates from the Tiflis, Baku, Batum,
Kutais and other Social-Democratic organisations in Transcaucasia. It
elected the League’s 9-man governing body, the Caucasian Union Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P., and approved the political line of the Leninist
Iskra; it adopted as

   

a basis for activity by Social-Democratic organisations in Trancaucasia the
draft Party programme worked out by Iskra and Zarya.


At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., there were three delegates
from the Caucasian League, who had been instructed to defend the programme,
organisational and tactical principles of the Leninist Iskra. From
the outset, the Caucasian Union Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. established
close ties with Lenin and provided firm support for the Bolsheviks in their
struggle against the Menshevik opposition. The League took an active part
in preparing the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., and its representatives
were on the Majority Committees’ Bureau, which made the practical
preparations for the Third Congress. The League played an important part in
organising the labour movement in Transcaucasia before and during the first
revolution in Russia. It did a great service in educating the workers of
the multi-national Caucasus in the spirit of proletarian
internationalism. In February 1906, the League was dissolved in view of the
establishment of united committees of the Bolshevik and the Menshevik
factions.

p. 125





{11}

A reference to Martov’s proposal at the second sitting of the Party
Council to give the Samara, Smolensk, Bryansk and Astrakhan committees the
same status as that accorded to those which had at tended the Congress,
that is, the right to vote in deciding on the convocation of a Party
congress.

p. 125





{12}

Martov proposed that the Caucasian League should be given the right to
vote for a congress, as of September 1903, when its Rules had been
approved.

p. 126





{13}

A reference to the decision taken by the January 1904 sitting of the
Party Council to publish the Council’s minutes.

p. 126





{14}

On June 5 (18), 1904, the Party Council—by the votes of the
Mensheviks G. V. Plekhanov, L. Martov and P. B. Axelrod, and the
conciliator V. A. Noskov (Glebov)—decided against publishing the
Council’s minutes.

Brunnen, July 28, 1904 

In view of my departure from Geneva and in view of Comrade
Glebov’s sudden departure, I think it is natural that all the business of
both C.C. representatives abroad should be handled by a commission of its
agents, that is, Comrades Olin, Bonch-Bruyevich and Lyadov.  

C.C. Representative abroad, N. Lenin

While by and large subscribing to the Riga
Declaration{1} as being a quite correct and principled expression of
the views and policy of the Party majority of the Second

    

Congress, the meeting deems it necessary to take a definite stand on the new
step taken by the C.C.


The meeting voices its deep conviction that the C.C.
declaration{2}
(see Iskra
No. 72{3}) strikes a major blow for clanishness as
against the Party principle, and is another betrayal of the interests of the
Party as a whole, a fresh attempt to corrupt the Party by introducing hypocrisy
into Party relations. The meeting brands the opposition by an accountable Party
organ to the convocation of a Party congress and its statement that any
agitation for the congress is harmful as a disgraceful fact not to be found in
the records of any dignified workers’ party. To receive one’s powers at a
Party congress from the Party majority and to proclaim this majority’s
policy to be a group policy; to speak of peace between the two contending sides
and to make a behind-the-scenes deal with the self-styled representatives
abroad of one of the sides; hypocritically to extol the “lofty”
stand of one’s opponents of yesterday and to begin reconciliation by
dismissing the members and agents of the C.C. who dared commit the crime of
agitating for a congress—all this is clear evidence that the new C.C. in
its new policy has decided to join the C.O. in treating the Party as a
nonentity. The meeting vigorously condemns this policy of Bonapartism, urges all
Party members to fight resolutely against usurpation and hypocrisy, and demands
the full publication of the Council’s minutes and all data on the activity
of the central bodies which do not have to be withheld for reasons of secrecy.


The meeting calls on all members of the Party sharing the principled views of
the majority to support the publishing house set up by Comrade
=

Bonch-Bruyevich{4} and to agitate vigorously for the convocation of
the Third Congress.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

A reference to the appeal “To the Party”, adopted by a conference of
22 Bolsheviks and published as a separate leaflet by the Riga Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P. in August 1904

(see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 454–61).

p. 127





{2}

A reference to the Central Committee’s “July
Declaration”, a resolution adopted by the conciliator members of the
Central Commit tee—L. B. Krasin, V. A. Noskov and L. Y. Galperin—in
July 1904. It consisted of 26 points, nine of which were published in
Iskra No. 72 of August 25 (September 7), 1904, under the title
“Declaration of the Central Committee”. The resolution was adopted
illegally, without the knowledge of two C.C. members: =

V. I. Lenin, who was in Switzerland, and R. S. Zemlyachka. They were
thereby deprived of the possibility of standing up for the Party majority’s
view in the Central Committee. In this resolution,

   

the conciliators voiced their recognition of the Menshevik Editorial Board
of the new Iskra, whom Plekhanov had co-opted. Three more
conciliators were co-opted to the Central Committee: =

A. I. Lyubimov, L. Y. Karpov, and I. F. Dubrovinsky. The conciliators came
out against convening the Third Party Congress and dissolved the Central
Committee’s Southern Bureau, which had been campaigning for the
Congress. They stripped Lenin of his rights as the Party Central Committee
representative abroad, and prohibited the publication of his works without
the permission of the C.C. collegium. The adoption of the “July
Declaration” marked a complete betrayal of the decisions of the Second
R.S.D.L.P. Congress by the conciliator members of the Central Committee and
their open switch to the Menshevik side.  

Lenin issued a sharp protest against the “July Declaration”. In his
letter “To Five Members of the Central Committee” and his pamphlet
Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with
the Party, Lenin exposed the illegal acts of the three members of the
Central Committee (see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 462–63, 529-35). Lenin
was supported by the Party’s local committees—St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Riga, Baku, Tiflis, Imeretia and Mingrelia, Nikolayev, Odessa, and
Yekaterinoslav—which resolutely condemned the “July Declaration”.

p. 128





{3}

A reference to the Menshevik Iskra. The Editorial Board of the
Party’s Central Organ, consisting of V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov and
L. Martov, was approved at the Second Party Congress. But contrary to the
Congress decision, the Menshevik Martov refused to sit on the Board without
the old Menshevik editors (P. B. Axelrod, A. N. Potresov and
V. I. Zasulich), who had not been elected by the Second Congress; so
Iskra’s Nos. 46 to 51 came out under the editorship of Lenin and
Plekhanov. The latter subsequently switched to the Menshevik stand and
demanded the inclusion on the Board of the old Menshevik editors who had
been rejected by the Congress. Lenin could not accept this and withdrew
from the Iskra Editorial Board on October 19 (November 1), 1903;
he was co-opted to the Central Committee and from there started a struggle
against the Menshevik opportunists. Iskra’s No. 52 was issued
under the editorship of Plekhanov ale no, and on November 13 (26), 1903,
Plekhanov rode roughshod over the will of the Second Congress by co-opting
Axelrod, Potresov and Zasulich. From its No. 52, Iskra ceased to
be a militant organ of the revolutionary Marxists. The Mensheviks turned it
into an organ for fighting Marxism and the Party, and a mouthpiece of
opportunism.

p. 128





{4}

The Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin Publishing House of Social-Democratic
Party Literature was set up by the Bolsheviks at the end of the summer
of 1904, when Iskra’s Menshevik Board refused to publish
statements by Party organisations and members in support of the decisions
of the Second Party Congress and in favour of convening the Third Party
Congress. The Publishers were given assistance by local Majority
Committees.

Notes

See present edition, Vol. 3.—Ed.

 



{2}

There is no information about Lenin’s having either written the work or
given a lecture on the subject. The date has been approximated from the
fact that the MS. is on the reverse of the MS. of Lenin’s remarks to Rosa
Luxemburg’s article “The Organisational Questions of Russian
Social-Democracy”, which was published in No. 69 of Iskra on
July 10, 1904.  

The material on the study of the works by authors whom Lenin mentions
in-the two plans is published in Lenin Miscellany XXXII. This
material was also used by Lenin for his lectures on “Marxist Views of the
Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia”, which he gave at the Russian
Higher School of Social Sciences in Paris from February 10 to 13 (23 to
26), 1903 (see Lenin Miscellany XIX, pp. 225–48).

Engels criticised the agrarian programmes of the French and German
Social-Democratic parties in his work The Peasant Question in France
and Germany (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. II,

In the autumn of 1904, the Geneva group of Bolsheviks set up, on
Lenin’s initiative, a propagandists’ circle which was largely made up of
grass-root Party workers—working-men and young people without theoretical
knowledge. The aim was to train men for work in Russia, and the studies
were in the form of retorts and lectures. Lenin was the head of the circle,
and conducted the studies on the Party Programme. Classes were soon stopped
when some of the comrades went back to Russia in view of the outbreak of
the revolution. A number of documents characterising the work of the circle
are at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism. Lenin’s notes, plans of talks and records of the debates
on the lectures are published in Lenin Miscellany XV, pp. 283–85,
287.

The meeting was held in the port of London on August 14, 1889, in
connection with the start of the dock-workers’ strike for higher per-hour
wages and at least four hours of work a day. Ten thousand workers
(including some unemployed) were involved in the strike. They set up a
strike committee, whose secretary was Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Karl Marx’s
daughter. The strikers had the support of workers in Britain, Australia and
a number of European ports. During the strike, the first dock-workers’
union was set up, with branches in all the major British ports. The strike
continued for five weeks and ended when all the workers’ demands were
met. It gave an impetus to the development of trade unions and was a
turning-point in the British labour movement.

no other means of fighting them except a break. The earlier and more

From the Editorial Board. The conclusion of our St. Petersburg comrade
fully bears out the correctness of our own conclusion (Vperyod

of the majority to exercise firmness in removing the disorganisers as soon as
possible so as to have a chance to work, instead of engaging in squabbles.

This is the initial variant and the final text of the “Note by the
Vperyod Editorial Board to the Letter of Their St. Petersburg
Correspondent”, which has not been found. It was apparently to have gone
into the newspaper’s issue No. 4 or No. 5, but the January 9, 1905 events
must have crowded out the other reports, and then the letter was too old to
print.  


Vperyod—an illegal Bolshevik weekly, published in Geneva
from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5 (18), 1905. Eighteen
issues appeared, with the printing of 7,000 to 10,000 copies. It was
organised and run by Lenin, who had also proposed the newspaper’s name. On
its Editorial Board were V. V. Vorovsky, M. S. Olminsky and
A. V. Lunacharsky. The paper’s correspondence with local committees in
Russia and its reporters was handled by N. K. Krupskaya. Lenin defined the
content of the paper as follows: “The line of Vperyod is the
line of the old ‘Iskra’. In the name of the old Iskra,
Vperyod resolutely combats the new Iskra”

(see present edition, Vol. 8, p. 130).

Lenin not only wrote the leading articles but also a great number of notes,
and edited many reports. He wrote some of the articles together with other
members of the Board (Vorovsky, Olminsky and others). The MS.s of various
authors which have been preserved show the heavy editing and extensive
insertions made by Lenin, who always read the page proofs. Even when he was
engrossed in the work of the Third Congress in London, he found the time to
read the page proofs of No. 17. Issue No. 18 appears not to have been read
by him in view of his departure from London to Geneva. More than 60
articles and notes by Lenin were carried in Vperyod, and some of
its issues—such as Nos. 4 and 5, dealing with the January 9 events and
the start of the revolution in Russia—were almost entirely done up by
Lenin.  

The Third Congress passed a special resolution with a vote of thanks,
noting the outstanding p art played by Vperyod in the struggle
against the Mensheviks, for the restoration of the Party principle, in the
raising and elucidating of the tactical questions brought out by the
revolutionary movement, and in the struggle for the convocation of the
Congress. Under a decision of the Third Congress, Proletary was
published as the Central Organ of the Party and a direct successor of
Vperyod.

How They Defend Themselves 


)

Two replies to Lenin’s pamphlet on The Zemstvo Campaign and
âIskraâ’s
Plan{1}

–the

Editorial Board’s and
Plekhanov’s. This and is also curious (Plekhanov is
nominally on
the Board), but the distinction between their replies is extremely
interesting.



Plekhanov defends an incorrect stand very cleverly and cautiously. The Editorial
Board, not cleverly.


Plekhanov says nothing at all about either 1) Starover’s
resolution and its connection with the Iskra plan, or 2) the
âhigher type of mobilisationâ. Ergo, what Plekhanov passes over in
silence is the

 e s s e n c e

of Iskra’s mistake
(Starover’s resolution is the beginning of the mistake, its

Printed from the original

    

starting-point. The final point—the consideration of the âhigherâ type).


The Editorial Board emphasises the connection of its stand with

typeâ.


Both the Editorial Board and Plekhanov make a very weak stand for
the talk on panic (clearly retreating and backtracking).


Plekhanov keeps harping on the contradiction between the old and the new

Lenin{5} in an effort to prove that the Iskra Editorial
Board was acting according to the old Lenin.


Plekhanov tries to create the impression that Lenin is now opposed
to demonstrations before the Zemstvo men and is against dictating to them a
âpositive programme of actionâ. This is an absurdity and a distortion.



What were my theses against Iskra?



 1) 

The talk of panic is vulgar and irrelevant.

This was written some time in January 1905 as a proposed reply to
Plekhanov’s article âOn Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal

In his article âOn Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal

Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarismâ
says: âBy the way, about the panic. The recent Tambov events may perhaps

The group which initiated the establishment of the R.S.D.L.P. library at Geneva
has unanimously decided to hand it over to the Majority Committees’
=

Bureau{1} for the general management of the library pending a
decision by the Third Party Congress.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Majority Committees’ Bureau (M.C.B.)—the
Bolsheviks’ organisational centre for preparing the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., set up on Lenin’s initiative at the end of 1904. In that
period, the Party was in a profound crisis. The Mensheviks had seized the
Party centres and were engaged in disorganising and splitting the Party
organisations in the localities, and disrupting the unity of working-class
action. Meanwhile, the revolutionary situation in the country demanded
cohesion of the Party’s forces and militant unity of the proletariat. This
dictated the need for an early convocation of the Third Party Congress,
which was frustrated in every possible way by the central bodies, which
were in the hands of the Mensheviks. Under Lenin’s leadership, the
Bolsheviks launched a campaign for convening the Congress. A great part was
played by the conference of 22 Bolsheviks called on Lenin’s initiative in
Geneva in August 1904. It adopted an appeal âTo the Partyâ, written by
Lenin, which became a programme for Bolshevik struggle for the convocation
of the Third Congress. Three regional conferences of Bolshevik
committees—Southern, Caucasian and Northern—were held in Russia from
September to December 1904. They set up the Majority Committees’ Bureau,
which included V. I. Lenin, R. S. Zemlyachka, S. I. Gusev, M. N. Lyadov and
M. M. Litvinov. Guided by Lenin, the M.C.B. carried out the practical work
in preparing the Third R.S.D.L.P. Congress.

1895 and 1905
 [SQUIGLY.]


(Short Parallel) 

There are here
eigentlich{1}

two topics:


1) the parallel of growing work; 2) present day organisational tasks. They
should be dealt with in two separate articles.



1. Compare the scope, proportions and forms of Social-Democratic work then
   and now.


2. Scope: only circles then. Scarcely the first beginnings
 of mass agitation. Propaganda very heavy and academic.
 The Social-Democrats making their way among the
 Narodnaya Volya movement, the Narodnoye
Pravo{5} movement, etc.


3. Today. The Party. Ordinary mass agitation. Open political action in the
   street. Revolutionary epoch.


4. Forms. 10–16 persons (committee). 20–30 workers’ circles. Maximum, 100–150
   ties. âReadings.â Self-education—the crux.


5. Today. The organisation has grown to many âstoreysâ
   St. Petersburg and Odessa
[committee—districts—organisers’
   meetings (central circles)—groups, and then âthe centreâ
   and the bureau. Something like five new storeys.]


6. âA Letter to a
Comradeâ{2}

was written at a time when the new storeys
were being put together and the Economists slowed down their growth. The
ideas advocated in âA Letter to a Comradeâ have now virtually
been translated into life.


    

      
7. New tasks: γ) Abundance of storeys has brought up a new section of Party
workers, Party members. Their participation should be formalised. (1)
Information—resolutions—polls—direct ties with the Central
   Organ.
(2) Elective principle? (3) Indication or selection of candidates for
    co-optation?


8. Another and perhaps even more important task: the work of adding new
horizontal storeys should be supplemented by the work of new
âverticalâ, you might say, ways of influence. That is: the growth
   of the movement makes it necessary and possible to supplement this current
   work on the storeys by the upper storeys addressing the mass in new
   forms of massive meetings. âShort meetingsâ and âmass
   ralliesâ, as a natural product of work on many âstoreysâ,
   of themselves lead up to that higher form which prevails abroad and will
   triumph here le lendemain de la
révolution,{3}

namely: to the âmass
ralliesâ as the principal means of political influence on the
proletariat and its Social-Democratic education.


9. Of course, this makes the âstoreysâ equally
necessary. They will (always?) be necessary. The thing is to âsupplementâ
and not to âsubstituteâ....

Narodnoye Pravo (People’s Right)—an illegal party of Russian
democratic-minded intellectuals, founded in the summer of 1893 with the
participation of former members of the Narodnaya Volya, 0. V. Aptekman,
A. I. Bogdanovich, A. V. Gedeonovsky, M. A. Natanson, N. S. Tyutchev and
others. Members of the Narodnoye Pravo Party set themselves the task of
uniting all opposition forces to fight for political reform. The party put
out two programme documents: âManifestoâ and âVital Questionâ. In the
spring of 1894 it was broken up by the tsarist government. Lenin gave an
assessment of the Narodnoye Pravo Party as a political organisation in his
What the âFriends of the Peopleâ Are and How They Fight the
Social-Democrats and The Tasks of the Russian
Social-Democrats

(see present edition, Vol. 1, pp. 129–332 and Vol. 2, pp. 323–51).

Most of the members of the Narodnoye Pravo Party subsequently joined the
Socialist-Revolutionaries.

Notes
 
 



{1}

This plan is close in content to Lenin’s article “A Militant Agreement
for the Uprising”

(see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 158–66)

and was apparently written after the article, because it raises the
question of a combat committee, which the article does not.

I

L e n i n.

Proposes that all the results of the section’s work should be
made public—above all that Stepanov should submit his report in writing,
and also the minutes. A general summary of these minutes should be handed over
to the Congress; they could provide many practical indications during the work
of the Congress. Stepanov’s report is regrettably much too abstract in
character. If exact conclusions in the form of resolutions are to be made from
the reports, they must be more concrete. With that end in view I propose a poll
among comrades in Russia

    

and abroad, specifying that they should give precise answers to the
questions stated (yes, no, so many). A picture of their work, e.g., the
town in which one worked, the questions one decided at meetings, etc. While
the summarised conclusions could yield something, I repeat that no precise
conclusions could be drawn from them. That is why I propose that the circle
should set about working out a questionnaire to be circulated among
comrades in Russia and abroad, for concise replies to all questions. If we
have at our disposal raw material of this kind (if 100–200 comrades
reply), the Congress could use it for precise conclusions.  

I reiterate my proposals: first, a summary of all the minutes and also
the minutes themselves should be submitted to the Congress; second, a start
should be made on drawing up a questionnaire. This should be done right
away, without any delay, and I propose that all work in the section should
be dropped in favour of putting the minutes in order and writing a report
on them for the Congress.  
II

L e n i n.

Now that the announcement of the convocation of the Third Congress is out,
the work of the sections has taken on a different character. The sections
have now been working for two months, but very little has been done, all
things considered: the minutes are not all there, and there are no reports;
we should make haste with this, so that all these efforts should be of
practical importance and not go to waste, i.e., all this should be placed
before the Congress. In order to submit the minutes as soon as possible, I
propose that the whole circle should set about helping the secretaries. I
repeat that unless the circle completes this work, all its efforts threaten
to remain within the circle itself, whereas they could help to work out
organisational plans. Furthermore, I propose that we should start right
away on working out a questionnaire—we must make haste with all this,
time does not wait. The Congress may take place very soon. The best thing
is to entrust the working out of a questionnaire to a special committee.

    

III

L e n i n.

I have no objections to Comrade Olga’s proposal. As for my experience, I do
not believe I have any, in view of the rapid change of events and
conditions of work. I did draw up a questionnaire, but it was much too
general. I propose that experienced comrades should be elected to a
committee for drawing up the questionnaire, and that this business should
be accelerated to the utmost.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Geneva Party Majority Club was formed at a conference of
R.S.D.L.P. promotion groups abroad on January 13, 1905, and had four
sections for elaborating questions of Party life: 1) organisation, 2)
propaganda, 3) agitation, and 4) technical matters.  

A sitting of the organisation section on March 5, 1905, discussed a
report by A. M. Essen (Stepanov) on how to organise work mainly among the
non-proletarian sections of the population (students, soldiers and
peasants). Lenin spoke thrice: first, after the report, then after a speech
by Robert (unidentified), and again in connection with a speech by Olga
(S. N. Ravich), who proposed that Lenin should be invited to take part in
drawing up a “questionnaire in view of his wide experience of practical
work in Russia.  

When Lenin says: “I did draw up a questionnaire, but it was much too
general”, he means his “Questionnaire”

(see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 200–01).

 From the Editors. We publish this resolution by
the worker-comrades as a characteristic manifestation of the mood that in
certain circumstances may sway a considerable section of the fighting
     proletariat.{1}


A Party split—especially a secret split—undoubtedly inflicts countless
calamities on the labour movement. The above-mentioned Kharkov
resolution{3} shows that there are Mensheviks in Russia who are much
more conscientious about their Party duty than the comrades abroad. This is
also shown by the new declaration issued by the C.C. together with the
Majority Committees’
Bureau.{4} Let us once again wish success to this latest attempt at
unification.

In a resolution earned by No. 14 of Vperyod on April 12

immediate unity.

{3}

A reference to the resolutions of the Menshevik Kharkov Commit tee, on
the election of a delegate to the Third R.S.D.L.P. Congress, and of the
Kharkov Bolshevik group, on the need to unite the Party “on the basis of a
common, strictly principled tactics and centralised organisation”. Both
were published in No. 14 of Vperyod.

p. 141





{4}

A reference to the agreement between the M.C.B. and the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee on the convocation of the Third Party
Congress. The principles of the agreement were set out in the appeal “To
the Party” on behalf of the Central Committee and the M.C.B. on March 12
(25), 1905, which was published in No. 13 of Vperyod on April 5
(March 23), 1905, in Lenin’s article “The Second Step”. The agreement
said that “further work in connection with convening the Congress is to be
carried jointly by the M.C.B. and the C.C., which form an Organising
Committee”. Lenin gave an assessment of the agreement in his articles
“The Second Step” and “The Council Is Caught Out”

(see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 262–66, 330–34).

{1}
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in London from
April 12 to 27 (April 25 to May 10), 1905. It had been prepared by the
Bolsheviks and was directed by Lenin. The Mensheviks refused to attend it
and met for a conference at Geneva.  

The Congress was attended by 38 delegates: 24 with vote, and 14 with
voice only. Delegates from twenty-one R.S.D.L.P. committees had
Votes. Lenin was a delegate from the Odessa Committee. Among the delegates
were V. V. Vorovsky, B. S. Zemlyachka, N. K. Krupskaya, A. A. Bogdanov,
A. V. Lunacharsky, M. M. Litvinov and M. G. Tskhakaya. Lenin was elected
chairman of the Congress.  

The Congress examined the basic questions of the unfolding revolution
in Russia and determined the tasks of the proletariat



and its party. Lenin wrote the draft resolutions on all the main questions
debated by the Congress. He gave reports on Social-Democratic participation
in a provisional revolutionary government and on the resolution concerning
support for the peasant movement; ho spoke on the armed uprising, the
attitude to the government’s tactics on the eve of the revolution, the
relations between the workers and intellectuals in Social-Democratic
organisations, the Party Rules, the report on the Central Committee’s
activity and other questions

(see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 359–424).

The Congress laid out the Party’s strategic plan for the
bourgeois-democratic revolution and defined the Party’s tactical line. The
Congress set out the organisation of an armed uprising as the Party’s most
important and pressing task. The Congress said that the victory of the
armed popular uprising should lead to the establishment of a provisional
revolutionary government, whose task would be to suppress the resistance of
the counter revolution, carry out the R.S.D.L.P. minimum programme, and
prepare the conditions for the transition to a socialist revolution.  

The Congress reviewed the Party Rules: it adopted Lenin’s formulation
of Paragraph One, which deals with Party member ship; eliminated the
duocentric system (the C.C. and the C.O.) in the Party, and set up a
single, governing Party centre—the Central Committee; it gave a precise
definition to the C.C.’s powers and its relations with the local
committees.  

The Congress condemned the acts of the Mensheviks and their opportunism
in organisational and tactical questions. In view of the fact that
Iskra had fallen into Menshevik hands and was conducting an
opportunist line, the Congress authorised the Central Committee to set up a
new Central Organ, Proletary. A Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee on April 27 (May 10), 1905, appointed Lenin editor of the
newspaper.  

The Third Congress was of tremendous historical importance. It was the
first Bolshevik congress, which gave the Party and the working class a
militant programme of struggle for the victory of the democratic
revolution. For the work and importance of the Congress see Lenin’s article
“The Third Congress” (present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 442–49). The Congress
decisions were substantiated in Lenin’s book Two Tactics of
Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution

(see present edition, Vol. 9, pp. 15–140).

## Representation of Certain Organisations









Lenin: 1905/3rdcong2: DRAFT RESOLUTIONS OF THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THE THIRD CONGRESS ON THE REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN ORGANISATIONS






V. I. Lenin
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
APRIL 12–27 (APRIL 25–MAY 10), 1905

DRAFT RESOLUTIONS OF THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THE THIRD
CONGRESS ON THE REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN
ORGANISATIONS{1} 

Caucasus 

The Organising Committee, having examined the question of the Caucasian
delegation on the basis of the facts published in various writings and the
testimony of witnesses, comrades from the Caucasus, has arrived at this
unanimous decision: 

1. Among the votes at the Congress, it is necessary and solely correct
to reckon the 8 votes of the Caucasian delegation, because back in the
autumn of 1903, the C.C. approved the Rules of the Caucasian Union
Committee, and under these Rules, the Caucasian Union Committee, as a Union
Committee, was allowed 8 votes at the Congress.  

2. As for the contradictory statements by Comrade Glebov in the Council
and the Council’s decision in May 1904 to regard temporarily, pending
clarification of the question, as votes those of the four separate
Caucasian committees (Baku, Batum, Tiflis and Imeretia and Mingrelia), the
Organising Committee cannot consider this statement of Glebov’s and the
Council’s decision an obstacle to the adoption of the conclusion stated in
§ 1, since Comrade Glebov has clearly shown himself to be uninformed,
which is why he unwittingly misled the Council.  

3. Considering it unquestionable that there are now three delegates
from the Caucasus with six votes, the O.C. states that Comrade Leonov,
member of the Caucasian Union Committee, declares the following concerning
the fourth delegate with two votes: the Caucasian Union Committee intended
to allow the Batum Committee to approve this fourth delegate. When the
Batum Committee gave a vague and evasive reply on this matter, the
Caucasian Union Committee, at a sitting attended by Leonov, expressed the
wish that in the absence of a special delegate from

    

Batum at the Congress the votes of the fourth delegate should be
transferred to Comrade Kamenev (Yuri).  

4. Stating this, the O.C. leaves it to the Congress itself to decide on
the question of a fourth delegate from the Caucasian Union Committee.  

Kremenchug 

Concerning the powers of the Kremenchug Committee the Organising
Committee declares: 

1) The Kremenchug Committee was approved by the Central Committee only
in August 1904, according to Comrade Mark, a member of the C.C., who
attended the meeting of the C.C. at which the approval took place.  

2) The Kremenchug Committee does not appear on the Party Council’s list
of 33 empowered organisations, which was published in Iskra
No. 89.  

On the strength of the above stated, the O.C. decides:
not to regard the Kremenchug Committee among the full-fledged organisations
with the right of vote at the present Congress.  

Yekaterinoslav 

The Organising Committee, having heard the report of Comrade Morozov,
delegate of the Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee, and the written
communication of Comrade Yevgeny, member of the old committee in
Yekaterinoslav, reached the following unanimous decision: 

The Organising Committee does not see any grounds to consider the
present Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee less legitimate than the Minority
Committee either in formal terms or in terms of succession and ties with
local workers.  

However, in view of the fact that the O.C. has no opportunity of
hearing the explanations of the other side, it does not adopt a decision on
the vote of the delegate from the Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee,
leaving it to the Congress itself to decide on the matter.  
 

Concerning the powers of the Kazan and Kuban commit tees, the O.C. has
failed to reach any decision, as the votes of the C.C. and the M.C.B. were
split.  
 

The M.C.B. believes that these committees cannot be recognised as
having the necessary powers because these committees did not appear on the
list of committees approved until April 1, 1905, at the Council’s sitting
in May 1904 (delegates Lenin and Glebov from the C.C.). Even if the Kazan
and Kuban committees were approved by the Central Committee after May 1904,
they will at any rate be entitled to representation only after one
year. Besides, these committees could not have been approved at the general
meeting of the C.C. in July 1904, because the minutes of this meeting were
in their entirety delivered by Glebov to Lenin abroad, and they contained
no information concerning, the approval of the Kazan and Kuban
committees. Finally, nothing was said about it either at the August or
September sitting of the C.C., which was attended by C.C. member Comrade
Mark.  

The C.C. believes that since these committees were inserted in the
Iskra list, apparently on behalf of the Party Council, we have no
ground for recognising these committees as lacking the required powers.

APRIL 12–27 (APRIL 25–MAY 10), 1905

O.C. DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
CONGRESS{1} 

Concerning the point of the agreement between the C.C. and
the M.C.B. under which the Congress shall open in the presence of
three-quarters of the delegates of the Russian committees, the
O.C. resolves: 

Both sides, making up the O.C., see this point as meaning that both the
C.C. and the M.C.B. should have taken the most vigorous measures to achieve
full representation at the Congress and also to guarantee to the Party that
the C.C. and the M.C.B. have set themselves the aim of organising an
all-Party and not a factional congress. This point

    

of the agreement was not at all meant to offset the effect of the paragraph
of the Party’s Rules under which a congress is valid in the presence of
one-half of the total number of votes. As for the plenitude of
representation at the Congress, all measures have been taken on that
score. There is no news only from the Astrakhan and the Crimean
committees. The selection of delegates and their dispatch abroad (in two
instances, transfer of mandates from the Kuban Committee to comrades
abroad, Parvus and a person to be appointed by the Iskra Editorial
Board) have been carried out by the Don, Gornozavodsk, Kiev, Kuban, Tver,
Kharkov, Smolensk, Siberian and Yekaterinoslav committees. Together with
the delegates available from 19 committees, we would have, with these
9 committees, a total of 28 committees, that is, more than three-quarters
Out of 34 committees (the figure of 34 is the maximum number of empowered
organisations initially on the O.C. list).  

If 9 delegates from the said committees have failed to turn up at the
Congress, despite the fact that they were given the corresponding mandates
from the committees and arrived abroad, their absence is due to no fault of
the O.C., but to the fact that all the efforts of the O.C. to achieve full
representation at the Congress were frustrated by the illegal resistance of
the three members of the Party Council.

No Kazan Committee delegate attended the Congress until the eighteenth
sitting, in view of the fact that the Organising Committee had been unable
to contact the Kazan Committee in good time. V. V. Adoratsky, a member of
the Kazan Committee, was abroad at the time. To ensure the attendance of
the Kazan organisation, Lenin wrote to the Credentials Committee,
suggesting that Adoratsky should be invited to attend the Congress with
voice but no vote as a member of the Kazan Committee. The Credentials
Committee proposed that Adoratsky should be invited “simply as a member of
the Party”, and it is this formula that Lenin found strange.  

The Congress, by a majority, with two against, decided to invite
Adoratsky “as a member of the committee”. It proved to be impossible to
inform Adoratsky of this decision, and he did not attend the Congress. Only
by the eighteenth sitting did a delegate from the Kazan Committee
arrive. He was I. A. Sammer (Savich), who was allowed voice but no vote.

SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF A DEBATE ON THE O.C. REPORT 
APRIL 13 (26)

I propose that we should take into consideration the statement by
Comrade Sosnovsky and others on the desirability of limiting the debate on
the O.C. report to the formal aspect only. Comrade Andreyev’s resolution
fails to achieve its
aim.{1} The comrades wanted to have a discussion only on the legality
of convening the Congress and not in substance. To discuss the report in
substance is equivalent to discussing the Party crisis. The bureau will
keep speakers within the limits of a discussion on the legality of
convening the Congress.

N. A. Alexeyev (Andreyev) motioned this resolution: “The O.C. report

morality”. In the debate on this question, Andreyev adhered to the
resolution motioned by Lenin (see p. 147), which was adopted by the
Congress.

I would have no objection to the proposal of Comrades Mikhailov, Voinov
and
Zimin.{1} But there is a danger that the Congress will overdo the
agenda debate. The agenda at German Social-Democratic congresses runs to 5
or 6 items; we had up to 25 at the Second Congress. There is already a
danger of our debate getting out of hand. I propose that we adopt as a
basis the agenda with a better breakdown.

The proposal put forward by D. S. Postolovsky (Mikhailov),
A. V. Lunacharsky (Voinov) and L. B. Krasin (Zimin) was that the Congress
agenda should be drawn up under four heads: organisational questions,
tactical questions, attitude to other parties and delegates’ reports. This
proposal was adopted. In the subsequent discussion and amendment, the
agenda was adopted with these main heads: 1) tactical questions; 2)
organisational questions; 3) attitude to other parties; 4) work within the
Party; 5) delegates’ reports; 6) elections.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE CONGRESS STANDING ORDERS 
 APRIL 13 (26) 

It is dangerous to substitute committees for Congress sittings. The
committees discuss many interesting questions

    

which are then lost and do not get into the minutes. The committees do not
have enough time for serious work, and it is not desirable to extend it to
the detriment of the Congress work. It would be well to elect a resolutions
committee right away, so as to give our work some direction at least. We
also need a committee for examining the reports. I doubt whether we need
organisational, agrarian and armed uprising committees. We have the old
Rules, there is Ivanov’s draft, there is Comrade N. F.’s
opinion,{1} there is quite enough material.

The draft motioned by Ivanov (A. A. Bogdanov), which Lenin mentions,
was the new draft Rules of the R.S.D.L.P. submitted to the Congress by the
Majority Committees’ Bureau. It was published in No. 13 of Vperyod
on April 5 (March 23), 1905, under the

   

title “Organisational Question”. The draft, with some amendments outlined
at preliminary meetings of delegates, was read out by Bogdanov (Maximov) at
the fifteenth, afternoon, sitting of the Congress on April 20
(May 3). Following a discussion and the introduction of a number of
amendments, the Rules were adopted at the seventeenth, afternoon, sitting
on April 21 (May 4).  

The remarks of N. F. (B. B. Essen) on Ivanov’s draft were published
under the title “Concerning the Draft Party Rules” in the Supplement to

SPEECH MOTIONING A DRAFT RESOLUTION ON ELECTION OF COMMITTEES TO EXAMINE

I motion this resolution: “The Congress shall elect:
1) a committee for examining the delegates’ reports and preparing them for
communication to the Congress; 2) a committee for appointing rapporteurs
and drafting resolutions on the principal items of the agenda.”  

The speeches of delegates have convinced me that it is the only way we
can work fruitfully. If we adopt the system of a general debate and
subsequent discussion in committee, the result will be similar to that at
the Second Congress. Care must be taken to have the fullest possible
publication of the Congress deliberations for the purpose of giving the
Party the best information. In view of the atmosphere of suspicion
surrounding the Congress, it is especially necessary to give our debates
the greatest possible publicity and the fullest record in the minutes.

proposal to invite Comrade Arnatsky
(r e a l  [NB] name), a member of the Kazan Committee, to attend
the Congress with voice but no
vote.{1} I request the Credentials Committee to examine this proposal.


Comrade Arnatsky is abroad, in France, and told me he was ready to
attend the Congress at his own expense. He will soon be going to Russia and
could swiftly report to his committee on the Congress. Despite all its
efforts, the Organising Committee was unable to contact the Kazan Committee
or obtain a reply from Kazan. There is therefore almost no hope of the
Kazan Committee taking part in the Congress. Our efforts abroad to contact
Kazan from over here have likewise failed, and there has been no reply to
our letters. Arnatsky has also failed to get in touch with Kazan from over
here. In view of the impossibility of having a delegate from the
Kazan Committee to attend the Congress, should we not invite Comrade
Arnatsky, as a member of the committee, to attend with voice
but no vote?  

Lenin.

At the O.C. sitting I reported on the written request from Comrade
Filatov (real name) for admission to the Congress with voice but no
vote. Comrade Filatov is the author of the articles on the uprising in
Vperyod, signed V.S. For the Congress he has prepared a
letter and a pamphlet-report: “Application of Tactics and Fortifications
to a Popular Uprising” (in a suitcase left in Boulogne). I request

    

that Comrades Belsky and Voinov who had worked with Comrade Filatov in
Paris{2} should be asked to give him a reference.

During the discussion of this question at the fourth sitting of the
Congress on April 14 (27), 1905, Lenin said that he had not proposed an
invitation for V. V. Filatov (NN), but had merely handed his written
request to the Congress (see Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 80).  

The proposal to invite Filatov to the Congress with voice was rejected.

REPORT{1}

I think it would be wrong to have the Congress confirm the
organisations immediately. I am opposed to the giving of a vote. I do not
agree with Comrade Kamsky about a coup d’état.

Notes
 
 



{1}

At the fourth sitting of the Congress (on the morning of April 14
[27]), Lenin spoke twice (for the second speech, see present edition,
Vol. 8, pp. 365–67). After the report of the Credentials Committee, there
was a debate on the granting of votes to the Bolshevik organisations which
had existed and worked parallel to the Menshevik committees (the Kharkov
and Yekaterinoslav groups and the Committee of the Organisation Abroad) and
also to the Archangel Committee, which had not been confirmed.  

V. M. Obukhov (Kamsky) said that the granting of votes to the
“C.O.A. and the parallel groups is a coup d’état in form and in
substance”.  

Under a Congress decision, all these organisations were given voice but
no vote.

Under the Party Rules adopted by the Second R.S.D.L.P. Congress, only
organisations confirmed not less than one year before the Con a the right
of representation at the Congress. Under the Rules, the Kazan and Kuban
committees were not regarded as fully empowered at the Third Congress,
because they were not on the list of full-fledged committees in the minutes
of the Party Council prior to September 1, 1904. At the fifth sitting of
the Third Party Congress on April 14 (27), V. V. Vorovsky (Orlovsky)
motioned a draft resolution written by Lenin on coning these committees as
full-fledged forthwith. The resolution was adopted at the same sitting.

At the fifth sitting of the Congress on April 14 (27), as it was con
firming the Kazan and Kuban committees as being full-fledged forthwith,
some delegates said that it was undesirable for delegates with voice only
to take part in the voting, as this could have an effect on the results of
this crucial decision.  

In this connection, Lenin wrote the draft resolution on the procedure
governing the voting of questions at the Congress which was adopted at the
same sitting.

V. I. Lenin
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
APRIL 12–27 (APRIL 25–MAY 10), 1905


   

15

REMARKS ON RUMYANTSEV’S DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE QUESTION OF OPEN POLITICAL
ACTION BY THE R.S.D.L.P. 

I think the resolution should be reworded as follows:

 Motives: 

(1) stating that under the pressure of the revolutionary movement,
there is an actual beginning of open action by the political parties, etc.


(2) that in this the liberals have gone especially far, their
actual privilege (Schmidt’s point 1).  

(3) that there is a tremendous urge among the workers for the
same thing (Schmidt’s point 2).

 —c o n c l u s i o n s:

 (1) no occasion should be missed for open action, the workers to
   be organised into an independent force in the course of the action
   itself; 
 (2) even the slightest legal forms should be used in an effort
   to get the legal labour organisations under Social-Democratic influence;
   
 (3) the idea should be spread in all labour organisations and
   among the broadest possible masses of the need of taking practical measures
   to set up, alongside our secret apparatus, an apparatus for open Political
   action.

    [+0) The b e g i n n i n g of the actual winning of freedom
   of action.





[BOX:]

Better 2)

    1)

 1) The working masses strive for open action.  
 2) The liberals are making intensive use and are
   gaining a preponderance.  
 3) The need to prepare for a possible transition in the near
   future from the usual, exclusively secret forms of activity to open forms.
   



Resolves:

 1) no occasion should be missed ... open action to be worked out
   by separate organisations on the spot 
 2) the use of even partial legal forms of organisation
   in an effort to subject them to Social-Democratic
     influence.]{1}

THESES FOR A RESOLUTION ON THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS’ PARTICIPATION IN A
PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT 

M o t i v e s  o f  t h e  R e s o l u t i o n: 

 1) The necessity of political freedom and a democratic republic.
   
  [2) The existence of a revolutionary bourgeois
   and petty-bourgeois democracy able and beginning to fight for it.

  3) The necessity of the proletariat’s support
   for revolutionary
democracy....]{1}

 4) The necessity of a provisional revolutionary government for
   the complete overthrow of the autocracy and actual guarantees of
   freedom for a constituent assembly.  
  [5) Recognition by revolutionary
   Social-Democracy of revolutionary action not only, from below, but also
   from above. 
  6) The necessity of Social-Democracy’s
   participation in a provisional revolutionary government in the event of a
   complete victory for the revolution, where it directs the
  uprising.]{2}

 7) The bourgeois-democratic character of the revolution and the
   necessity of the proletariat’s taking an independent position as distinct
   from bourgeois democracy.  
  [8) The existence of an organised
   Social-Democratic Labour Party capable of open organisation (with broad
   participation of the workers) and control over the Party’s authorised
  agents.]{3}



R e s o l u t i v e  S e c t i o n  o f  t h e  R e s o l u t i o
n 
 on Social-Democratic Participation in a Provisional
Revolutionary Government 


 1)


 The propaganda and agitation for the idea of a provisional
   revolutionary government as a necessary component part of a victorious
   revolution.



 2)


Discussion of the whole of our minimum programme at workers’ meetings
   not only from a general standpoint, as

    

we all have discussed and should discuss the maximum programme, but from the
standpoint of the possibility of its full and immediate implementation.



 3)


Recognition that in the event of a victorious popular uprising the
Social-Democrats may take part in a provisional revolutionary government
   together with the revolutionary bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois democrats
for the purpose of conducting a relentless struggle against all
counter-revolutionary attempts, for the purpose of completely clearing the
democratic soil in Russia, for the purpose of using all the means ensured by the
government for the broadest possible organisation of the working class.




These are subjective conditions. What about the objective ones? for the purpose
of carrying on a relentless struggle against the counter-revolution. P. 3.


4) Necessary condition of such participation—control by the
Social-Democratic Labour Party over its authorised representatives in the
government
   and undeviating protection of the independent working-class party, hostile to
   all manner of bourgeois democracy in its striving for a full socialist
   revolution.





{{ NB  A r m e d  proletariat }}


5) At any rate, regardless of whether or not the Social-Democrats succeed in
   taking part in a provisional revolutionary government, the idea must
   be spread in the working class of the necessity of independent workers’
    r e v o l u t i o n a r y organisations to exercise control
   over
    e v e r y  revolutionary government and to exert pressure on it.

A reference to the speech by A. I. Rykov (Sergeyev) at the thirteenth
sitting of the Congress against the draft resolution motioned by
V. I. Lenin and P. P. Rumyantsev (Filippov). Rykov said that “the
resolution does not apply to the agenda” and that its points “could be
referred to the question of the liberals and agitation”; he proposed that
they should be examined during the discussion of the corresponding items on
the agenda. The Congress rejected Rykov’s proposal, and adopted the draft
resolution.

1

I agree with Comrade Belsky’s
opinion.{1} We tend to minimise the concept of revolution when using
this word in relation to the mere wresting of a few paltry rights.  
2

I agree that “revolutionary way” is an expression for a more vigorous
conduct of struggle, but this tends to minimise the concept of
revolution. I propose either that we replace it by the words “regardless
of the law”, or that after “revolutionary way” we delete the words
“minimal programme”, as it could be taken to mean that we want to carry
through the whole revolution in this way.

{1}

When the thirteenth sitting of the Congress discussed the draft
resolution on the attitude towards the government’s tactics on the eve of a
revolution, there was a great debate on point “c” of the resolutive
section, which read: “To organise the proletariat for the immediate
introduction, in a revolutionary way, of an 8–hour working day and for the
implementation of all the main demands of our minimum programme.”
P. A. Krasikov (Belsky) objected to the words “revolutionary way”, and
proposed their substitution by the words “actual gain”.  

As a result of the debate, the point was adopted in the following
wording: “To organise the proletariat for the immediate implementation, in
a revolutionary way, of an 8-hour working day and the impending demands of
the working class” (see Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 222).

APRIL 12–27 (APRIL 25–MAY 10), 1905



    

19

RESOLUTION ON THE ATTITUDE
TO THE PEASANT MOVEMENT 

1) Whereas the currently growing peasant movement, though spontaneous and
politically unconscious, is nonetheless inevitably directed against the
   existing political order and against all the remnants of the serf-owning
   system in general;


2) Whereas it is one of the tasks of Social-Democracy to support every
revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order;


3) Whereas, in view of the aforesaid, the Social-Democrats must strive to purge
   the revolutionary-democratic content of the peasant movement of all manner of
   reactionary admixtures, developing the peasants’ revolutionary class-consciousness, and consistently putting through their democratic demands;


4) Whereas the Social-Democratic Party, as the party of the proletariat, must in
   all cases and under all circumstances work steadfastly for the independent
   organisation of the rural proletariat and clarify for this class the
   irreconcilable antagonisms between its interests and those of the peasant
   bourgeoisie;


—The Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
instructs all Party organisations


a) to carry on propaganda among broad sections of the people explaining that
Social-Democracy sets itself the task of giving the most vigorous support to all
revolutionary measures of the peasantry capable of improving its condition,
including the confiscation of landlord, government, church, monastery and crown
lands;


b) as a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry and as a means of
instilling the utmost political consciousness into the peasant movement, to urge
the necessity for the immediate organisation of revolutionary peasant
committees, with the aim of carrying through all revolutionary-democratic
reforms in order to release the peasantry from the tyranny of the police, the
officials and the landlords;

 

c) with the aim of disorganising the autocracy and maintaining the revolutionary
onslaught against it, to urge the peasantry and the rural proletariat to engage
in all possible political demonstrations, collectively refuse to pay duties and
taxes, to perform military service or obey the decrees and orders of the
government and its agents;


d) to strive for the independent organisation of the rural proletariat, for its
integration with the urban proletariat under the banner of the
Social-Democratic Party, and for the election of its representatives to the
peasant committees.

{1}

During the discussion at the fifteenth sitting an April 20 (May 3) of
the report and draft resolution of A. A. Bogdanov (Maximov) on the
relations between workers and intellectuals in Social-Democratic
organisations, some delegates asserted that there was no such problem in
the Party, and that there was no need to adopt any resolution on it.  

The Congress resolved to defer the matter until the adoption of the
Party Rules.  

At the nineteenth sitting on April 22 (May 5), the Congress resumed its
discussion of the question. A number of resolutions were motioned. Lenin’s
draft (see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 407–08), which he motioned jointly
with A. A. Bogdanov, was adopted as a basis for the discussion. Lenin spoke
several times (see ibid., pp. 411, 412). By a roll-call vote the Congress
decide d not to a d opt any special resolution on the question. Lenin’s
proposals were taken into account in the resolution on propaganda and
agitation.

Social-Democratic ideas.


II. It is not right to say (as Vlasov did) that the elective principle will not
make for better information of the outlying districts, etc.

    

      
III. Vlasov said that it is the intellectuals that are at the head (of
splits and oppositions). This is confirmed by Latyshev, Lyadov,
Kramolnikov, etc.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE PARTY
RULES{1} 
 APRIL 21 (MAY 4) 
1

Comrade Kitayev’s proposal is more practical, for under it the
convocation of an emergency congress demands a quorum equal to one-half of
the number of votes at the preceding congress.  
2

On the contrary, things are facilitated by the establishment of the
specified number required to convene a congress. The required number of
votes is established after each congress. One addition only is necessary,
and that is a note under which the list of committees confirmed by the
C.C. shall be published in the C.O.  
3

The list of newly confirmed organisations shall be published
immediately in the Party C.O., with a statement of the time of their
confirmation by the C.C.  
4

I am in favour of the initial wording of § 6 carried
Vperyod,{2} as otherwise there is an irregularity.  
    

5

I agree with the opinion of Comrade Petrov and the others. Comrade
Belsky’s proposal should be inserted in the
note.{3} 
6

In the interests of the C.O. I must come out in favour of Comrade
Kitayev’s amendment. With the newspaper issued weekly, there is need to be
informed of developments and have sufficient quantities of
material.{4} 
7

I favour unanimous
co-optation.{5} The C.C. is not big, and for the sake of positive
effort and political direction, we must ensure that its members are
like-minded.

I agree with Comrade Kuznetsov: § 13 should be deleted from the
Rules and the corresponding resolution tabled by Comrade Belsky in the
Bureau
adopted.{6}

Notes
 
 



{1}

During the debate, on the draft Party Rules, the Congress substantially
reworked the Party’s organisational principles, chiefly on three main
questions: 1) amendment of § 1 of the Rules; 2) precise definition of
the powers of the Central Committee and an extension of the autonomy of
local committees; 3) establishment of a single centre. The Congress adopted
§ 1 as worded by Lenin. By a

   

majority, the Congress abandoned the dual centre arrangement, in the form
of the C.C. and the C.O., which the Second Congress had set up. One
centre—the Central Committee—was retained. The Third Congress devoted a
great deal of attention to the demarcation of the powers of the Central
Committee and those of the local committees, and to the relations between
the committees and the periphery, which was granted more powers. By a
majority, the Congress decided to expunge § 8 from the draft Rules and
adopt a special resolution on the question. Lenin voted for retaining
§ 8 in the Rules. The nineteenth sitting on April 22 (May 5) adopted a
resolution motioned by V. V. Vorovsky (Orlovsky) on the duty of the centres
to inform the periphery about Party affairs and to reckon with their voice,
the resolution which replaced § 8 of the Rules (see Trety syezd
R.S.D.R.P., pp. 325, 327–28).  

To prevent the committees from abusing their autonomy, and to make it
possible to replace the committees which do not justify themselves,
§ 9 of the new Rules said: “A local committee. must be dissolved by
the C.C. if two-thirds of the C.C. and two-thirds of the local workers
belonging to the Party organisations declare for such dissolution”.

For two of Lenin’s speeches during the debate on the Party Rules on
April 21 (May 4) see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 413–15.

p. 158

§ 6 of the draft Rules published in No. 13 of Vperyod on
April 5 (March 23), 1905, said: “All organisations within the Party shall
autonomously manage all matters relating specially and exclusively to that
sphere of Party activity for the dealing with which they have been set
up.” The Third Congress adopted § 6 in a different wording (see
Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 461).

p. 158





{3}

Under § 7 of the draft Party Rules, every Party organisation with
the right of vote at the Congress had the right to publish Party literature
at its own expense and on its own behalf.  O. A. Kvitkin (Petrov) came out
for § 7 with the amendment of A. A. Bogdanov (Maximov) to the effect
that “all periodical Party publications shall publish all the
C.C. statements at its request”.  

P. A. Krasikov (Belsky) proposed that permission to publish Party
literature should be given only when the practical slogans contained in it
were in complete accord with the decisions of inter national
Social-Democratic congresses and Party congresses. § 7 of the Party
Rules was adopted in the wording proposed by D. S. Postolovsky (Mikhailov)
with the amendment by A. A. Bogdanov (see Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P.,
p. 461). P. A. Krasikov’s amendment was rejected.

p. 159





{4}

During the debate on § 11 of the draft Party Rules, which said
that “Every Party organisation shall place before both the C.C. and the
C.O. Editorial Board all the means for making a study of all its activity
and all its members”, A. M. Essen (Kitayev) motioned the following
addendum: “submitting detailed reports to the C.C. on its activity, at
least twice a month”. After Lenin’s speech, this addendum was adopted.

p. 159





{5}

A reference to § 12 of the draft Rules, which said that
“Co-optation of members to the C.C. shall be unanimous”. The unanimity
proposal was adopted.

p. 159





{6}

§ 13 of the draft Rules said: “The Committee of Party
Organisations Abroad has the aim of conducting propaganda and agitation
abroad and also of promoting the movement in Russia. It shall provide
support to the movement in Russia only through persons and groups specially
designated by the C.C.”  

The resolution of P.A. Krasikov (Belsky) said: “The Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. authorises the C.C. to examine and approve the Rules of the
Organisation Abroad with the rights of a full-fledged Party committee
conducting propaganda and agitation abroad, with the proviso that the
Committee of Organisations Abroad shall give assistance and support to the
movement in Russia only through persons and groups specially designated by
the C.C.”  

The Congress deleted § 13 from the Rules and adopted
P. A. Krasikov’s resolution.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ON GENERAL MEETINGS OF THE
C. C.{1} 
 APRIL 21 (MAY 4) 

I favour Maximov’s resolution. If it is difficult to get together once
in three months, the period could be extended to four months. The
C.C. member abroad must know everything and take part in deciding on the
most important matters. If there is difficulty for all to get together, a
meeting does not have to be full.

The draft resolution of A.A. Bogdanov (Maximov) on general meetings of
the C.C. said: “The Congress makes it binding on the C.C. to have
periodical meetings—at least once in three months—of both its parts”,
i.e., of the C.C. sections in Russia and abroad.  

The resolution was adopted with an amendment stating that these
meetings were to be held “at least once in four months” (Trety syezd
R.S.D.R.P., p. 466).

REPRESENTATION{1}

L e n i n

makes a reference to the minutes of the Second Congress showing that the
Kazan Committee was listed as one of the organisations whose powers
required formal confirmation. Since no formal confirmation has been forth
coming, there is no ground to rescind the resolution already taken by the
Congress. The Kazan representative must remain at the Congress with voice
only, while the committee; according to the Credentials Committee’s
proposal, should seek formal confirmation right away.

Notes

At the eighteenth sitting of the Congress on April 22 (May 5), the
question of the Kazan Committee’s representation came up once again with
the arrival of its delegate I. A. Sammer (Savich). The Credentials
Committee proposed that the Congress “should abide by its earlier decision
and admit the Kazan Committee delegate with voice but no vote” (see
Tray syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 314).  

Sammer asked the Congress to allow his committee a vote. After a
debate, the Congress rejected a resolution motioned by B. V. Avilov
(Tigrov) on granting a vote to the Kazan Committee and confirmed the
Credentials Committee’s resolution.

I object to any examination of the resolutions one by one to avoid
fragmentation and propose that they should be referred to committee for
consolidation. In particular, concerning Comrade Kitayev’s opinion that the
Party committees should consist of organisers only, let me say that they
alone would be insufficient for the functioning of the committees.

I should have no objection to this, but isn’t the C.C. being burdened
with too much work by being asked to organise these conferences?  

I propose that instead of “the C.C. should organise” we say:
“both the Central and the local committees should organise”, and instead
of “conferences of representatives of local committees”, say:
“conferences of representatives of various organisations of our Party”.

2

That is right. I am against any additions which introduce nothing but
formalism and red tape.

The draft resolution said: “Recognising the unification of Party work
to be an urgent demand of Party life, recognising that such unification is
best achieved in the process of work and in joint discussion of general
Party slogans by as many Party workers as possible—the Third Party
Congress recognises it as desirable that the C.C. should, for these
purposes, organise conferences of representatives of local committees.”


Lenin motioned amendments to the resolution and supported L. B. Krasin
(Zimin) and D. S. Postolovsky (Mikhailov), who opposed the addenda motioned
by G. L. Shklovsky (Dedushkin) and A. I. Rykov (Sergeyev) (see Trety
syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 342). Lenin’s amendments were adopted.

A draft resolution motioned by P. P. Rumyantsev (Filippov) said that
there should be no agitation on the periphery and in the workers’ masses
against whole Menshevik organisations or against individuals refusing to
accept the Congress decisions, and that dissolution of Menshevik committees
and establishment of Bolshevik committees where parallel organisations
exist should be carried out in a most cautious manner, only when it was
quite clear that a majority of the local committee members had refused to
accept the decisions of the Third R.S.D.L.P. Congress. After a debate, the
first part of the resolution was rejected, and the second adopted in the
wording of Lenin and Bogdanov (Maximov) as not subject to publication (see

 APRIL 23 (MAY 8) 

We are being offered something unacceptable. What, after all, does
Comrade Mikhailov want? Does he want the agreements to be concluded only by
the C.C. and local committees jointly? But the C.C.’s general resolutions
are binding on local committees. It is unreasonable to consider the special
case in which the Menshevik C.C. got something wrong. The local committees
should also be allowed to display initiative. We should authorise the local
commit tees as well to co-ordinate the activity with Social-Democratic
organisations locally. If the C.C. does not happen to find itself in
conditions where it cannot be located, it will, of course, always be
consulted.

The twenty-first sitting on April 23 (May 6) discussed a draft
resolution on the attitude towards non-Russian Social-Democratic
organisations motioned by V. V. Vorovsky (Orlovsky). It said: =

“...The Third R.S.D.L.P. Congress, reaffirming the attitude of the Second
Congress on the question of federalism, authorises both the C.C. and the
local committees to do their utmost to reach agreement with the national
Social-Democratic organisations for the purpose of co-ordinating local
work, thereby paving the way for a possible unification of all
Social-Democratic parties into a single R.S.D.L.P.” (Trety syezd
R.S.D.R.P., p. 365).  

D. S. Postolovsky (Mikhailov) proposed the following text: =

“authorises the C.C., as well as the local organisations, to make
joint efforts” (ibid.). He argued that agreement could be reached
only “when it was arranged not only by the C.C. but by the local
committees as well” (ibid., p. 371). This amendment was opposed by Lenin
and rejected by the Congress.

## Question of the Attitude to the Liberals

 SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF THE ATTITUDE TO THE
LIBERALS 
 APRIL 23 (MAY 6) 

It is inappropriate to raise the question of agreements with the
liberals. Things in Russia have reached the point of an uprising, and in
such conditions an agreement is highly unlikely. Even if some
Osvobozhdeniye groups or liberal-minded students willing to act
arms in hand are to be found, we really cannot conclude an agreement with a
man like Struve.  

Adds to Comrade Voinov’s report on the Zemstvo congress
in Moscow (quotes The
Times).{1}

In addition to what A. V. Lunacharsky (Voinov) said, Lenin quoted a
Moscow report which appeared in The Times No. 37700 on May 6,
1905, under the title “Zemstvo Congress at Moscow. Purposes and
Prospects”.  

On the Zemstvo congress in Moscow see Lenin’s article “The Advice of

 APRIL 25 (MAY 8) 

I am being accused of contradicting myself in the matter of the
trial. If the Congress were a general one, the question of the trial would
have been raised even earlier, but every thing that has gone before clearly
shows what the matter was. The C.C. is unable to make a report, because it
is confused. The way out for the C.C. was found in the same thing:
the Congress, which met later than it should have done. When the “accused
pleads guilty”, there is no need for any judicial proceedings.

The twenty-third sitting heard and discussed the C.C. report given by
L. B. Krasin (Zimin). Some speakers noted that the report failed to
describe the political activity of the Central Committee and demanded that
the C.C. representative tell the Congress why the C.C. had not succeeded in
guiding the Party as its political leader. Those were the statements Lenin
had in mind when he spoke of the “trial” in his second speech on the
C.C. report.

amendments and addenda were adopted and written into the resolution (see
Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P., p. 457).

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE RESOLUTION ON THE EVENTS IN THE CAUCASUS

APRIL 28 (MAY 9)
1

It is wrong to say that the Party undertakes to appoint an uprising
when the Caucasus starts a revolution. We merely authorise the C.C. to
support the
      movement.{1}

    

2

On the whole I agree with Comrade Petrov’s
amendment,{3} although it does not contain any revolutionary
call.{2}

Notes
 

{1}

The records of the Minutes Committee give the end of the speech as
follows: 

“We merely authorise the C.C. to support the movement but the
conclusion does not follow that we should only agitate and propagandise,
taking account of the situation in the Caucasus. I call everyone’s
attention to this paragraph.  

“No one has requested the floor. The debate is
closed.”—Ed.  

{2}

The records of the Minutes Committee give the speech as follows:


“L e n i n.

Shouldn’t we add ‘to the proletariat and the peasantry of
Russia’? Rybkin has just said the resolution could state that the Caucasus
should not start an uprising until Russia is capable of sup porting it. But this
would require a change in the whole resolution. The important thins is the
testimonials of local men. On the whole, I agree with Comrade Petrov’s
amendment, although it does not contain any revolutionary
call.”–Ed.

 



{3}

O. A. Kvitkin (Petrov) proposed the words “armed force” at the end of
the draft resolution on the events in the Caucasus to be replaced by the
words “all the means at their disposal” (Trety syezd R.S.D.R.P.,
p. 442). Kvitkin’s amendment was adopted.

Notes
 
 



{1}

Lenin gave the lecture on the subject in Geneva on May 19 or 20 (June 1
or 2), and soon after that in Paris. In a letter to L. A. Fotieva, who was
in Paris, Lenin wrote on June 1 or 2 that he intended to go to Paris and
asked her to organise his report on “The Third Congress and its
Decisions”. The content of the report was, Lenin wrote, “a parallel
analysis of our decisions and those of the Mensheviks. They have just
issued an announcement about their conference, and I will analyse it”

(see present edition, Vol. 36, p. 148).

By announcement he meant the Menshevik pamphlet First All-Russia
Conference of Party Workers, issued as a supplement to No. 100 of
Iskra on May 15, 1905. In his plan Lenin refers to pages in this
pamphlet.  

Lenin elaborated on some points of his plan in the article “A Third
Step Back”, which was published later

(see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 544–54).

1. Does it follow from Marx’s “Address” to the Communists in March
1850{3} that Marx regarded it as inconceivable for Communists
to take part in a provisional revolutionary government together with the
bourgeoisie in the epoch of a democratic revolution?  

2. Is it true that in this “Address” Marx did not even raise the
question of Social-Democratic participation in a provisional
revolutionary government?  

3. Is there any difference between: “regard participation as
inconceivable” and “not to raise the question of participation”?  

4. Is it true that in this “Address” Marx himself noted a
strengthening of the petty-bourgeois democratic party and a weakening of
the Communist workers’ party in the recent period?

Notes
 
 



{1}

This sets out the milestones in the struggle between the revolutionary
and the opportunist trends in Russian Social-Democracy. There is no article
written to this plan.  

Lenin characterised the stages of the internal Party struggle prior to
the Third R.S.D.L.P. Congress in his “A Brief Outline of the Split in the
R.S.D.L.P. A Letter to Greulich”, which he wrote in February 1905 (see
present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 125–31). Roughly the same stages as in the
present article are given in his plan written in August 1905 and entitled
“Plekhanov and the new Iskra” (see Lenin Miscellany V,
1926, pp. 360–66).

p. 168





{2}

A reference to the resolutions of the “Unity” Congress of
R.S.D.L.P. Organisations Abroad, held in September 1901. It was attended by
six members of the Iskra and Zarya organisation abroad
(among them V. I. Lenin, N. K. Krupskaya and L. Martov), eight members of
the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (including three members of the
Emancipation of Labour group: G. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod and
V. I. Zasulich), 16 members of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
(including five members of the Bund Committee Abroad) and three members of
the Borba group. At the Congress Lenin, who attended under the
name of Frey, spoke about the Union’s opportunist actions. When the Union
tabled its opportunist amendments and addenda to a resolution condemning
opportunism and recognising the need for the unity of all Social-Democratic
forces in Russia on the basis of Iskra’s revolutionary principles,
the revolutionary section of the Congress (members of the Iskra
and Zarya and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisations) issued
a statement on the impossibility of unification and left the Congress. On
Lenin’s initiative, these organisations in October 1901 united into the
League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

p. 168





{3}

A reference to the grouping of votes at the Second R.S.D.L.P. Congress,
which was held from July 17 (30) to August 10 (23), 1903. The Congress was
attended by 43 delegates with 51 votes. Of them 24 votes belonged to the
Iskra majority, 9 to the Iskra minority, 10 to the
“Marsh”, and 8 to the anti-Iskra group (3 Rabocheye
Dyelo members and 5 Bundists).

For details of the struggle at the Congress see present edition, Vol. 7,
pp. 335–49.

p. 168





{4}

The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. ended on August 10 (23), 1903,
and on August 15 (28) Iskra’s No. 46, in the editing of which
Lenin and Plekhanov took part, was issued. The exact meaning of Lenin’s
reference to August 13 (26) has not been established.  On November 13 (26)
Plekhanov co-opted the Mensheviks Axelrod, Martov, Zasulich and Potresov to
the Iskra Editorial Board

p. 168





{5}

A reference to Martov’s words at the Second Congress of the League of
Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, which took place from
October 13 (26) to 15 (31), 1903, to the effect that he, Martov, would
refuse to work with Martynov on the same Editorial Board.

p. 168





{6}

A possible reference to the letter sent on September 25–26 (October
8–9), 1903, by Iskra’s former editors to Lenin and Plekhanov, in
which they refused to collaborate on Iskra

(see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 354–55).

p. 168





{7}

A reference to the conference of 22 Bolsheviks and the Declaration of
19 Bolsheviks. The conference was held in the first half of August 1904.



Declaration of the Twenty-Two—an appeal “To the Party”
written by Lenin and adopted at the Bolshevik conference in Geneva, in the
first half of August 1904 (see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 454–61). The
conference was attended by 19 persons, among them V. I. Lenin,
N. K. Krupskaya, M. S. Olminsky, M. N. Lyadov and P. N. Lepeshinsky. Three
other Bolsheviks soon adhered to their decisions and the appeal “To the
Party” was issued on behalf of the 22. This was published in a special
leaflet in August 1904 and became the Bolshevik programme in the struggle
for convening the Third Party Congress.  

The Declaration of the nineteen was issued by the Moscow Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P. in October 1904 under the title “Appeal to Members of the
R.S.D.L.P.” (see Sbornik dokumentov i materialov “Trety syezd
R.S.D.R.P.” [Collection of Documents and Material “Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P.”], Moscow, 1955, pp. 99–106).

p. 169





{8}

These dates denote the period from the conference of 22 Bolsheviks
(first half of August 1904) to the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., which
was held from April 12 (25) to April 27 (May 10), 1905.

The Potemkin has appeared off
Feodosia.{1} It has restocked its food supply and has sailed for an
unknown destination having seized a Russian merchant ship with a cargo of

    

cattle. It is reported that it has also obtained some coal from a British
merchant ship. There is no question at all of surrender. The Potemkin
has set itself the task of sparking off an uprising in all the coastal
cities. Here is the text of a manifesto which the Potemkin is
circulating (according to a report by a German newspaper from Bucharest).


“To all civilised citizens and to the working people! The crimes of the
autocratic government have exhausted all patience. The whole of Russia, burning
with indignation, exclaims: Down with the chains of bondage! The government
wants to drown the country in blood, forgetting that the troops consist of sons
of the oppressed people. The crew of the Potemkin has
taken the first decisive step. We refuse to go on acting as the people’s
hangman. Our slogan is:
freedom for the whole Russian people or death! We demand an end to the war and
the immediate convocation of a constituent assembly on the basis of universal
suffrage. That is the aim for which we shall fight to the end: victory or death!
All free men, all workers will be on our side in the struggle for liberty and
peace. Down with the autocracy! Long live the constituent assembly!”

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

A reference to the mutiny on the battleship Potemkin, which
broke out on June 14 (27), 1905. The ship entered Odessa, just then in the
grip of a general strike, but no use was made of the favourable conditions
for joint action by the workers and sailors. The Bolshevik organisation in
Odessa had been weakened by arrests, and was not united. The Mensheviks
were opposed to an armed uprising and tried to restrain the workers and
sailors from offensive operations. The tsarist government sent the whole of
its Black Sea Fleet to crush the Potemkin mutiny, but the sailors
refused to fire at the insurgent ship, and their commanders were forced to
withdraw the fleet. After sailing the seas for eleven days, the
Potemkin, short of food and coal, made for Rumania and there
surrendered to the Rumanian authorities. Most of its sailors remained
abroad. Those of them who returned were arrested and committed for trial.


The Potemkin mutiny failed but the fact that the crew of a
major warship had gone over to the revolution was an important advance in
the struggle against the autocracy. Lenin said the uprising was an
“attempt to form the nucleus of a revolutionary army”

(see present edition, Vol. 8, p. 562).

Concerning the number of votes at the Congress, the Minutes Committee requests
readers to bear the following in mind. At the Congress, there were 46 votes
represented by 23 delegates, of whom one had one vote, one had three and the
rest, two each. (With the arrival of Comrade Golubin, i.e., from the 18th
sitting on, there were 24 delegates.) Almost all the voting at the Congress was
counted according to the number of delegates, i.e., for the sake of simplicity,
it was assumed that all the delegates had one vote each.

    

That is why the number of votes for and against adds up to 23 and not to 46. It
goes without saying that this simplification of the count could not have any
effect on the results, because both the number of votes for and the number of
votes against were equally halved. There was not a single instance of a division
of votes where a decision depended on a single comrade with three votes.

Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder)—one of the oldest
Russian newspapers published by Moscow University from 1756 (initially as a
small bulletin). From 1863 to 1887, the ultra-reactionary and chauvinist
M. N. Katkov was its publisher and editor, turning it into a monarchist and
nationalist mouthpiece for the most reactionary sections of the landowners
and the clergy; from

   

1905, the paper was one of the main organs of the Black Hundreds. It was
published until the October Socialist Revolution.

p. 173





{3}

Vestnik Yevropy (European Messenger)—a historical, political
and literary monthly of a liberal bourgeois trend published in
St. Petersburg from 1866 to 1918. It carried articles against the
revolutionary Marxists.

p. 173





{4}

Rus (Russia)—a liberal bourgeois daily published in
St. Petersburg from December 1903. Its publisher and editor was
A. A. Suvorin. During the 1905 revolution, the paper was close to the
Cadets, but took a more moderate stand. It was closed down on December 2
(15), 1905, and subsequently appeared at intervals under various names:
Rus, Molva (Tidings), XX vek (Twentieth
Century), Oko (Eye) and Novaya Bus (New Russia).

p. 173





{5}

Proletary (Proletarian)—an illegal Bolshevik weekly, the
Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., set up under a resolution of the Third
Party Congress. Lenin was appointed its editor-in-chief by a decision of
the Central Committee’s Plenary Meeting on April 27 (May 10), 1905. It was
published in Geneva from May 14 (4) to November 12 (25), 1905. There were
26 issues. The paper continued the line of the old, Leninist Iskra
and retained full continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod.


Lenin wrote about 90 articles and notes for the newspaper. Among those
who constantly took part in the work of its Editorial Board were
V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and M. S. Olminsky.  N. K. Krupskaya,
V. M. Velichkina and V. A. Karpinsky did a great deal of work for the
Editorial Board. The paper was closely allied with the working-class
movement in Russia and carried articles and notes from workers taking a
direct part in the revolutionary movement. Local reports were collected and
sent on to Geneva by V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich, S. I. Gusev and
A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova. N. K. Krupskaya and L. A. Fotieva carried on the
correspondence with local Party organisations and readers.  

Proletary instantly responded to all the important events in
the Russian and international labour movement and waged a relentless
struggle against the Mensheviks and other opportunist and revisionist
elements. The paper carried out a great deal of work for the propaganda of
the Third Party Congress decisions and played an important part in the
Bolsheviks’ organisational and ideological unity.  

Soon after Lenin’s departure for Russia in early November 1905, the
paper ceased publication. The last two issues (Nos. 25 and 26) wore edited
by V. V. Vorovsky, but they also contained several articles by Lenin, which
were published after his departure from Geneva.

The Principal Task of Socialist Policy 

An independent political party of the proletariat with a clear-cut
socialist programme.


First application in practice.


“C.D.”{5} Its (objective) tasks. Cf. Nasha
Zhizn,{6} September 18: win over the people, increase the
people’s confidence, etc., etc.


Cf. ibid. concerning the formation of the C.D. Party and the denial in
Birzheviye
Vedomosti.{7}


Is this confidence to be destroyed or maintained on certain
“conditions”?


Vacillation by the new-Iskra men (Parvus, Cherevanin, Martov:
“election of resolute men”).


Unconditional struggle against the C.D.s. “Conciliators.” Beginning
of betrayal.


Objections: 1) “absenteeism”. Slander. On the contrary, the most
active
agitation.{1}


2) support for revolutionary bourgeoisie. &Ctaila
dépend.{2}

In parliament? Yes. If we
are to choose between the conservatives and the C.D.s? Yes. But just now
   there is neither the one, nor the other, because there is
  n o

parliamentarism
a s  y e t.

Struggle for it. Betrayal in struggle. A
real[3]

support for the C.D.s at the present time means revolutionary
struggle and uprising. In the street or in parliament? (Cf. Marx \"uber
Ledru Rollin.
1849.{8})


The use of legal and semi-legal means? Unquestionably, yes. Labour
congress?—Yes. Meetings? Yes. But to make use of something which is close
does not signify merger or diffusion. To make use of it, one must be
independent, whole and united.

 

The absurdity of the new-Iskra tactics: “agreement and
support” plus “mock elections as a possible motive for an
uprising”. There can be 1,000 and 1 pretexts.


No. The tactic is now different: 1) Ruthless struggle against the
C.D. conciliators. 2) Badgering them for having gone into the Duma. 3)
Development of an independent Social-Democratic party in the struggle against
the C.D.s and while agitating over the State Duma. 4) Preparation for an
uprising which is coming and which—and not “parliamentarism”–is

  n o w

the crux of the situation. 5) The use for this
preparation, this agitation of all semi-legal and legal means.
6) Concentration on these slogans: armed uprising, revolutionary army,
   provisional revolutionary government.

pretext, nothing more. The danger of Petrunkevich & Co. in power.

The Cadets—members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party,
the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia. It was
set up in October 1905 and consisted of members of the bourgeoisie, Zemstvo
leaders from among the landowners, and bourgeois intellectuals. Among its
prominent leaders were P. N. Milyukov, S. A. Muromtsev, V. A. Maklakov,
A. I. Shingaryov, P. B. Struve and F. I. Rodichev. To deceive the working
people, the Cadets called themselves “the party of people’s freedom”, but
actually went no further in their demands than a constitutional
monarchy. After the October Socialist Revolution the Cadets operated as
bitter enemies of the Soviet power and took part in all the armed
counter-revolutionary action and campaigns of the interventionists. After
the defeat of the interventionists and the whiteguards, the Cadets
emigrated and continued their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activity.

Birzheviye Vedomosti (Stock-Exchange Recorder)—a bourgeois
newspaper founded in 1880. It was published in St. Petersburg, first thrice
a week, then four times a week, and then daily. From November 1902 it had
two editions: morning and afternoon. Its name became a byword for
adaptation, corruption and lack of principle. It was closed down by the
Revolutionary Military Committee at the end of October 1917.

Dialogue Between an Osvobozhdeniye Man


[DOUBLE SQUIGLY.]

and a Social-Democrat


[DOUBLE SQUIGLY.]



Pp.




1) impossibility of an up rising after the Potemkin.


—The impossible becomes (werden) possible.




2) reappraisal of the forces.


—“you are
wretched,[1]

and you are rich.”{3}




3) K. Kautsky on a provisional revolutionary government.


—the uprising is connected with a provisional revolutionary
government. Recognition of the uprising by the government=martial law.




4) unwisdom of the idea of boycott: failure to use the instruments.


—Once again learn from your enemies, if you don’t believe sour
friends. The government’s fear of a boycott.


    

      

5) the uprising and “elderly” workers. Trade unionism. “A
class party.”


—“non-combatants.” Indeed, it is correct to use them for trade
unionism, but they will provide a rear guard.




6) parliamentary rule: support neighbours, other wise you will help
Moskovskiye Vedomosti.


—indeed, in parliament we shall support you against Moskovskiye
Vedomosti, when such is the choice, but that is not the point just now. The
struggle is not in parliament, but over a parliament. You are
not fighters.



 

Notes
 

[1]

Total “wretchedness” from the standpoint of military technique, etc. But
have a look at the movement and its spontaneous growth:
January 9—Riga—Poland—1.5-million-strong
strike—Odessa—Caucasus—Moscow. September 1905.
—Lenin
 



{2}

This is a critique of the tactical line followed by the bourgeois
liberals who, in the magazine Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation) and
other periodicals, sharply opposed the idea of an armed uprising, rejected
the idea of boycotting the Bulygin Duma and called for participation in it.


Lenin criticised Kautsky’s stand on the provisional revolutionary
government (point 3 of the “Note”) in his article “Two Tactics of
Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution”

(see present edition, Vol. 9, pp. 108–09).



The question of making use of “elderly” workers (point 5 of the
“Note”) was elaborated in Lenin’s letter to S. I. Gusev of September 30
(October 13), 1905

(see present edition, Vol. 34, pp. 358–59).



Lenin elaborated the question of the Social-Democratic attitude to
parliament (point 6 of the “Note”) in his letter to A. V. Lunacharsky of
September 28 (October 11), 1905

(see present edition, Vol. 34, pp. 352–53).

We have repeatedly pointed out that the autocratic government is more
and more confused over its financial affairs (tricks would be an apter
word, I think). It is increasingly obvious that a financial collapse is
inevitable. Here is an interesting confirmation of this. The Berlin
correspondent of the London
Economist,{1} one of the most influential organs of the
European financial barons, reported on October 11 as follows: 


   “A representative of the Mendelssohn Bank has been in
   St. Peters burg this week to take part in the negotiations between the
   Russian Government and French bankers for the much-heralded new Russian
   loan. According to apparently authentic statements given out here, the
   amount to be raised will be about £75,000,000 [about 700 million
   rubles], of which France is to take about half, while the rest is to be
   offered in Germany, Holland, England, and the United States. It is also
   stated that a large part of the issue is to be devoted to taking up the
   Treasury notes placed in France and Germany during the war.  

   That Russia should appeal to the money markets at just
   this juncture, when all the great centres are under unusual pressure, is
   taken as striking evidence of its financial straits. One version of the
   story, however, has it that only a small part of the sum above mentioned is
   to be offered for subscription now, while the rest will be raised later,
   presumably early next year. But this only increases the unfavourable

    

   impression as to the urgency of Russia’s needs. That there is no enthusiasm
   in Germany for a Russian loan just at this moment goes without saying. Not
   only the condition of the money market here, but, more than all, the
   continuance of political turmoil in Russia, and the visible weakening, not
   to say breakdown, of Governmental authority there, are facts that are being
   weighed in Germany in a manner that augurs ill for the forthcoming
   subscription.”

We see, consequently, that class-conscious socialists must
unconditionally support the revolutionary struggle of all, even the
prosperous, peasants against the officials and landowners, but
class-conscious socialists must make the clear and straightforward
statement that the “general
redistribution”{2} the peasants want falls very far short of
socialism. Socialism demands the abolition of the power of money, the power
of capital, the abolition of all private ownership of the means of
production, the abolition of the commodity economy. Socialism demands that
the land and the factories should be handed over to the working people
organising large-scale (instead of scattered small-scale) production under
a general plan.  

The peasant struggle for land and liberty is a great step towards
socialism, but it is still a very far cry from socialism itself.  
2


   The tactical resolution adopted by the Congress is truly
   astounding by its meagreness. We are inclined to think that there some of
   the peasant well-wishers (liberals) must have done some more
   “explaining”.  

   Here is the resolution: 

   “The activity of the Peasant Union, depending on local
   conditions, may be either open or secret (conspiratorial). All members of
   the

    

   Union must spread their views and seek to realise their demands in every
   possible way, being undeterred by the resistance on the part of the Zemstvo
   chiefs, the police and other authorities. Among other things, they are
   insistently advised to make use of their right to draw up public decisions
   at village and volost meetings and private gatherings concerning
   improvements in state amenities and improvement of the people’s welfare.”
   


That kind of resolution is extremely unsatisfactory. Instead of a
revolutionary call for an uprising, it merely gives liberal advice of a
general sort. Instead of organising a revolutionary party, the resolution
only organises an annex to the liberal party. The progress of the movement
itself will inevitably and inescapably split up the liberal landowners and
the revolutionary peasants, and we Social-Democrats will try to accelerate
this split.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

No. 25 of Proletary on November 16 (3), 1905, carried
V. A. Karpinsky’s article “The Peasant Congress”, signed
V. Kalinin. Lenin edited the article and made two insertions.

p. 177





{2}

General redistribution—a slogan expressing the peasants’
striving for a general redistribution of the land and the elimination of
landed estates.  

In his article “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”,
Lenin said that the demand for a general redistribution, together with the
reactionary utopian idea of perpetuating small-scale peasant production,
also had its revolutionary side, namely, “the desire to sweep away by
means of a peasant revolt all the remnants of the serf-owning system”

(present edition, Vol. 6, p. 139).



Later, at the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., Lenin said: =

“We are told that the peasants will not be satisfied with our programme
and will go further. But we are not afraid of that; we have our socialist
programme for that eventuality, and consequently are not afraid even of a
redistribution of the land”

(present edition, Vol. 6, p. 497).

Comrade Dan has no knowledge of parliamentary tactics. In all the
countries of Western Europe a member of the bureau is not deprived of the
right to motion proposals.  
2

There are two proposals: a decision on the question of the 56 votes,
and exclusion of the whole district organisation from the conference. I
request a vote.  
    

3

I request a vote on the following question: can a section of the
St. Petersburg organisation here be deprived of representation?  
4

I request my proposal to be put to the vote first: does the assembly
agree to vote on Comrade Martov’s proposal?  
5

Comrade Nikolai motioned a proposal which he very correctly called
radical{2}; when a motioned proposal supersedes all the others, it is
voted on first.

called by the St. Petersburg Committee on February 11 (24), 1906, to decide
on the attitude to the Duma. The conference was guided by Lenin and was
attended by 65 delegates with vote. Elections to the conference were held
after discussion and voting on the tactical platforms of the Bolsheviks and
the Mensheviks with one delegate from thirty voting Party members. The
Bolsheviks won a substantial majority. The Mensheviks demanded the
invalidation of the votes of the district R.S.D.L.P. organisation, which
was almost entirely Bolshevik. Lenin made speeches and remarks during the
debate on the question of the district R.S.D.L.P. organisation

(see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 123–25).

The conference confirmed the representation of the district
organisation. It heard a report from the St. Petersburg Committee and
adopted Lenin’s resolution recognising the representation at the conference
valid, the conference effective and its decisions binding. Lenin gave the
report on the attitude to the Duma (there is no record of it in the
minutes). At the end of his report Lenin read out a resolution on the
tactics of active boycott. The Menshevik

   

resolution was read out by Martov. By 36 votes to 29, the conference came
out in favour of the active boycott, but had no time to adopt a resolution
giving detailed motivation of the tactic.  

To discuss this and give it final approval, a second city conference of
the St. Petersburg organisation was called at the end of February and the
beginning of March. It was attended by 62 delegates and discussed draft
resolutions tabled by Lenin, Martov and an additional one by the Mensheviks
of Okhta District. After a long and bitter struggle, the conference adopted
Lenin’s resolution by 35 to 24 with one abstention. It set up a committee,
which included Lenin, to give the final wording to the resolution. The
Mensheviks refused to take part in the committee and walked out.

SPEECHES AT THE SECOND SITTING OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING THE ROLL-CALL
VOTE ON THE WRITTEN STATEMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE CONGRESS
BUREAU{2} 
1

I second Comrade Schmidt’s proposal and invite all those wishing to
support this proposal to give their signatures.  
    

2

Comrade Larin’s proposal is nothing but the grossest kind of mockery of
the Congress minority by the majority....  

I repeat: this is gross mockery of the rights of the minority at the
Congress, it is an attempt to destroy the guarantees of the rights of the
minority held out by the standing orders.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held at
Stockholm from April 10 to 25 (April 23 to May 8), 1906.  

It was attended by 112 delegates with vote, representing 57 local
organisations of the R.S.D.L.P., and 22 delegates with voice only. National
organisations were also represented: the Social-Democracy of Poland and
Lithuania, the Bund, the Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Party, the
Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party and the Finnish Labour
Party. There was also a representative of the Bulgarian Social-Democratic
Labour Party.  

Among the Bolshevik delegates wore V. I. Lenin, M. V. Frunze,
M. I. Kalinin, N. K. Krupskaya, A. V. Lunacharsky, F. A. Sergeyev (Artyom),
S. G. Shahumyan, I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, J. V. Stalin, V. V. Vorovsky,
K. Y. Voroshilov and Y. M. Yaroslavsky.  

The Mensheviks had a majority at the Congress because many Bolshevik
Party organisations, which had led the armed action by the masses, were
broken up and could not send their delegates. The Central Area, the Urals,
Siberia and the North—Bolshevik bulwarks—were represented by a small
number of delegates. By contrast, the Mensheviks, who had the more numerous
organisations in the country’s non-industrial areas, where there had been
no mass revolutionary action, were in a position to send more delegates.


There was a bitter struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks
on every point of the Congress agenda. Lenin gave reports on the agrarian
question, the assessment of the current situation and the class tasks of
the proletariat, on the attitude to the Duma, the armed uprising and other
questions, and took part in the committee drafting the Party Rules (see
present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 277–309). The character of the decisions was
deter mined by the numerical superiority of the Mensheviks. After

   

a stubborn struggle, the Congress approved the Menshevik resolutions on the
Duma and the armed uprising, and adopted their agrarian programme.  

On the attitude to bourgeois parties, the Congress confined itself to
endorsing the resolution of the International Congress at
Amsterdam. Without debate, it adopted the compromise resolution on the
trade unions and the resolution on the attitude to the peasant movement.


At the same time, on the demand of the Party masses, the Congress
adopted Paragraph One of the Rules in Lenin’s wording, rejecting Martov’s
opportunist formula. The Bolshevik proposition on democratic centralism was
included in the Rules for the first time.  

The Congress decided on the question of uniting with the
Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and the Latvian
Social-Democratic Labour Party, which joined the R.S.D.L.P. as territorial
organisations working among proletarians of all nationalities in their
territories.  

The Central Committee elected by the Congress included three Bolsheviks
and seven Mensheviks. The Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat, the
Central Organ, consisted of Mensheviks only.  

The Congress is known as the “Unity” Congress, but it marked only the
formal unification of the R.S.D.L.P. Actually, the Mensheviks and the
Bolsheviks had their own views, their own platforms on the key
revolutionary questions, and in fact remained two distinct parties. Lenin
analysed the work of the Congress in his pamphlet Report on the Unity
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (A Letter to the St. Petersburg Workers)

(see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 317–82).

p. 179





{2}

At the second sitting of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
there was a discussion of the Congress standing orders under a draft put
forward by the United Central Committee. A debate ensued on the question of
the roll-call vote on the written statements submitted to the Congress
Bureau. Two proposals were motioned: one by the Bolshevik P.P. Rumyantsev
(Schmidt) and the other by the Menshevik M. A. Lurye (Larin). The former’s
was adopted. See Chetvyorty (Obyedinitelny) syezd

Rech{1} is resentful over the fact that in view of the
rumours of a semi-Cadet, semi-bureaucratic ministry, the Left-wing press
has begun to talk of a horse-trading deal between the Cadets and the
camarilla, of a betrayal which is inevitable in any such deals.  

“Is it necessary to prove that these assertions are false and
absurd?” writes the indignant Rech.  

It appears, Messrs. Cadets, that it is, and even highly, necessary to
do so, because in the same article (“Famine and Politics”) we read: 


   “This struggle (between the Duma and the present
   ministry), a slow and hard struggle, has resulted, however, in the question
   concerning a responsible cabinet being brought down from the sphere of
   abstract considerations to the soil of concrete reality, and in it being
   discussed as one of the real possibilities.”  

 

That is very good. But what about the question of dissolving the State
Council, the question of amnesty, the question of universal, etc.,
suffrage? Have all these questions likewise become “real
possibilities” already? Surely, they have not, have they? After
all, there is so far not even a rumour about them.  

That being so, what is one to do? “It is necessary to prove.”

On second thoughts, Rech finds that the general has asked much
too much for his patronage of the Cadet minis try and it declares that the
Cadets will not give up the principle of compulsory alienation of the land
in favour of the peasants and total amnesty, whatever portfolios they may
be offered. We think that the general, being the practical statesman that
he is, will see no reason for spoiling the deal over a matter of
principle. After all, under the Cadet plan not the whole of the land is
subject to compulsory alienation, but only as much as has to be allocated
to the peasants to enable them to pay the state taxes; further more, the
owners of the alienated land are to be paid in cash “on a fair valuation”
and these days money is ever so much easier to manage than land, which no
longer brings in as much income as before, in view of the stubborn refusal
of the peasants to cultivate it for others. As for the amnesty, the Cadets
have already done their duty to the country by informing the supreme
authorities of the people’s unanimous desire to see prisoners and exiles at
liberty, and, to refrain from encroaching on the inalienable prerogative of
the crown in this business, have decided to kill the amnesty bill which the
Trudovik group intends to table in the
Duma.{1} What the devil does General Trepov still want? Let’s have done
with the bargaining, General, and hand over the reins to the new driver,
“without any pangs,

    

without any fatal brooding, and without futile and empty doubts”: after
all, in ease of failure the “extreme measures” will still be at your
disposal....  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

First Duma (the so-called Witte Duma) was convened on April 27
(May 10), 1906, under an ordinance worked out by Chairman of the Council of
Ministers S. Y. Witte.  

Elected to the Duma were 478 deputies, over one-third of whom belonged
to the Cadet Party. It was dissolved on July 8 (21), 1906.  

Trudoviks—a group of petty-bourgeois democrats in Russian
Dumas consisting of peasants and Narodnik-minded intellectuals. The
Trudovik group was formed in April 1906 from the peasant deputies of the
First Duma.  

In the Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the
Social-Democrats, which was due to the class character of the peasant petty
proprietors. In view of the fact that the Trudoviks represented the peasant
masses, the Bolsheviks in the Duma pursued the tactic of reaching agreement
with them on various questions for conducting a common struggle against the
tsarist autocracy and the Cadets. In 1917, the Trudovik group merged with
the Popular Socialist Party and gave active support to the bourgeois
Provisional Government. After the October Revolution the Trudoviks sided
with the bourgeois counter-revolution.

Following the unsuccessful affair of the
Cadet-Octobrist-official ministry, the government has tried to scare the
Cadets with the prospect of a dictatorship. Now the Cadets are trying to
scare the government with the prospect of a revolution. Rech
writes: 


   “The conflagration is spreading—such is the impression
   of the news coming by cable from every corner of Russia.... It is no longer
   the revolutionary intelligentsia or even the working class that is aflame;
   the peasantry, the troops are aflame too. That is, it is more correct to
   say that the whole of Russia is in flames.... At the slightest pretext, the
   peasants flock in their thousands to deal summarily with the authorities,
   the landowners, the estates and the manors.”  


On the subject of this “conflagration”, Prof. Gredeskul hastens to
show the depth of his understanding of the historical events: 


   “We are undoubtedly on the eve of crucial
   events. Either the government will come to its senses within the next
   few days and hand the power over to a Duma ministry, or it will bring us to
   the greatest disasters.”  


And so, it is either a revolution or a Cadet ministry. It is not
surprising at all that a Cadet tries to use everything, the people’s
spontaneous revolutionary activity above all, to demonstrate the need for a
Cadet ministry. However, he is labouring under a delusion: the antidote—a
Cadet ministry—which the Cadet quacks are now prescribing for the
revolution will not work against the poison of spontaneous revolutionary
action by the mass, against its urge, to which Rech itself
testifies, to realise its right to freedom of assembly (not the Cadet
freedom of assembly, but full freedom) and to all the land.  
 

You can go on trying hard, gentlemen, but the revolution has coped with
the Witte-Durnovo system, and it will also cope with the Cadet antidotes.

 *     *  * 

It is either a revolution or a Cadet ministry, says Rech and
adds: we beg to inform you that we, for our part, are net afraid of the
revolution, whereas you are going to get hurt. But those who know how to
take a militant stand at a fighting moment are well aware of the worth of
such talk. Novoye
Vremya,{1} an organ of the pogromites and sergeant-majors, is also
well aware that Messrs. Gredeskuls give a reminder of the revolution only
because they fear it like the plague. That is why Novoye Vremya,
we believe, gives a much better exposé of the psychology and
political substance of the deal which is being prepared, when it says:
“Messrs. Cadets, we both have the same fear of the revolution, but we have
almost exhausted our resources in the struggle against it, and you still
have a thing or two left, which is why you should get on with it and not
drag things out for too long.” That is just what they are saying. The
Cadets say: we for our part can afford to wait. But the Novoye
Vremya gentlemen urge: come, make haste, the revolution is pressing.


The latest issue of Novoye Vremya says as much: 


   “...there will be an explosion the responsibility for
   which will fall not only on the present ministry, but also on the Cadet
   Party, which is guilty of the fact that being reluctant, for want of
   courage, to lose a part of its popularity among the extreme Left-wingers,
   it has led the Duma into a fatally drawn-out conflict and has committed a
   crime against the law of peaceful evolution, insisting on an immediate
   militant implementation of a political programme, a process which requires
   a very, very long time.”  


That’s how things are: there is a bit of bargaining, a bit of scaring,
and then a deal is done, for they have a common cause and a common aim.

Novoye Vremya (New Times)—a daily published in
St. Petersburg from 1868 to 1917 by various publishers, repeatedly changing
its political orientation. Moderately liberal at first, it became an organ
of reactionary landowner and official bureaucratic circles in 1876, when
A. S. Suvorin took over as publisher. From 1905—an organ of the Black
Hundreds. After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, the
paper gave total support to the counter-revolutionary policy of the
bourgeois Provisional Government and fiercely attacked the Bolsheviks. It
was closed down by the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd
Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917.

The newspaper
Mysl{1} carries an interesting “proscription list” of the
Yaroslavl Administration. Dozens of per sons (56 in the town of Yaroslavl
and 17 in the town of Rybinsk) are marked off in it as “suspects”, and a
secret report requests the police department for “appropriate
instructions”. In this connection, Mysl says: 


   “Let everyone pass judgement. He that hath ears to hear,
   let him hear. He that bath reason to understand, let him understand. The
   police department has now conceived a grandiose operation for the
   simultaneous radical and “final liquidation” of a number of organisations
   over the entire Russian land through a massive “seizure”, unprecedented
   in scale, of persons suspected of adherence to the Socialist-Revolutionary
   and Social-Democratic parties, and the peasant and the railway unions. For
   that purpose, the department has demanded full lists of suspected persons
   from the local authorities. These “proscription lists”, concentrated in
   one place, by now contain almost ten thousand names of persons over whom
   arrest hangs like the sword of Damocles.”  


And so, the government is hatching another plot. Military preparations
against the people, “measures” to dissolve the Duma, and lists containing
10,000 names for arrest! As in October-December, the government has made a
“dead set” at the revolution, utilising the relative freedom to lure out
and destroy thousands of more fighters for freedom.  

Let one and all, therefore, be at their post. The government is
prepared—the revolutionary people must also be prepared.

REPORT ON THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOR THE SECOND DUMA 
 NOVEMBER 4 (17) 

Resolution

 of the St. Petersburg and Moscow Committees, Polish Social-Democrats
and the
Latvians{5} 

1. We have had to accept a struggle on the Duma basis only through the
fault of the treacherous bourgeoisie.  

2. We must base the election campaign on opposition between
revolutionary and “peaceful” struggle, showing the great danger of Cadet
hegemony in the emancipation movement. Hence the question: is a bloc with
the Cadets (agreement at the first stage) admissible?  

3. At the first stage, Social-Democracy must, as a general rule, act
independently; by way of exception—agreements at the first stage with the
parties recognising the constituent assembly, armed uprising, etc.; at the
second stage—agreements of a technical character, only for the
proportional distribution of mandates. There is nothing more dangerous than
to tell the masses: vote with us for the conciliators. Krushevan is
dangerous not because he has a seat in the Duma, but because he is a
particle of the Black-Hundred organisation supporting the government. For
the sake of small separate exceptions you support Cadet hegemony, thereby
upsetting the whole of our principled position (the Caucasus, Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Poland refuse to have agreements). If the Black-Hundred men
are returned, the Duma will simply be more violent. Why do you believe that
it is not the Cadets but the Social-Democrats who are to blame for a return
of the Black-Hundred men—in the event of a split in the vote?

SUMMING-UP SPEECH ON THE REPORT ON THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOR THE SECOND
DUMA 
 NOVEMBER 4 (17) 

Agreement at elections is a bloc (you tell the masses:
do ut
 des{1}

).

We say: we sometimes go along with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, but never
with the opportunist and treacherous bourgeoisie. The election campaign
will proceed between two extremes: 400 Cadets + 100 Social-Democrats
(through agreement) and 200 Black-Hundred men + 250 Cadets + 20 or 50
Social-Democrats (without agreement). To put forward both an agent and a
fighter is to hit out at one’s own positions. The Black-Hundred men will be
defeat ed through agreements, but then the Social-Democrats will also be
defeated (morally).

 SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE MENSHEVIK ELECTORAL PLATFORM 
NOVEMBER 6 (19)

I have merely said that the platform contrasts
revolutionary and peaceful methods and nothing more, the rest being
unsatisfactory. Nothing is said about how the Social-Democrats differ from
other groups of “working people” (Socialist-Revolutionaries), as the
Social-Democratic group in the Duma does in its
declaration.{6} No distinction is made between scientific and vulgar
socialism.  

Nothing is said about the need to distinguish between the proletariat’s
stand and that of the petty proprietor. The platform does not come out for
a bloc, but it is a bloc, because any petty bourgeois will subscribe to
it. In a platform

    

we cannot remain silent about the other parties, and this one says nothing
about them, apart from a vague indication: “more resolute”, etc.

SPEECHES ON THE QUESTION OF CONVENING A “LABOUR CONGRESS” 
 NOVEMBER 7 (20) 
1

Lenin insists that the question of a “labour congress” is a burning
one and should be discussed.  
2

Lenin points to the publication of letters by Plekhanov, Martov and
others in the bourgeois press, and to the fact that Kostrov, for instance,
failed to table in the Duma group the proposal on the demand for a Cadet
ministry (which came front the C.C.), thereby Committing a breach of Party
discipline, and a good thing too. The agitation for a “labour congress”
is used to put spokes in the wheels of our Party’s activity. We have the
C.C. organ, but no Central Organ, and why not? There is enough money, the
C.C. organ is published regularly, but there is no organisation, and that
is why there is no C.O.

MINORITY OPINION ENTERED AT THE ALL-RUSSIA CONFERENCE OF THE R.S.D.L.P. ON
BEHALF OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES OF POLAND, THE LATVIAN TERRITORY,
ST. PETERSBURG, MOSCOW, THE CENTRAL INDUSTRIAL REGION AND THE VOLGA AREA


The Bund delegates have tabled a resolution at the conference which
almost entirely repeats the resolution of the Bund’s Seventh Congress, and
which gives a historical

    

assessment of the Duma
boycott.{7} The undersigned delegates to the conference have abstained
in the voting on this resolution for the following reasons. It is wrong and
impossible to separate the question of why we go into the
Duma{8} from the question of how we get there. Recognition
that the boycott is correct means that the basic character of all our
tactics remains absolutely the same under the present participation in the
election as it was during the boycott of the First Duma. To recognise that
the Cadet majority of the First Duma was a hindrance to the activity of the
revolutionary elements, while endorsing agreements between the Cadets and
the Social-Democrats at the first stage of the elections is to have our
general premises beaten by our practical policies. To recognise and support
Cadet hegemony in agitation before the masses by putting up common
electoral rolls only to condemn this hegemony later in a special additional
resolution, is to compromise in the strongest possible way all the tactics
and all the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy. Those are the
grounds on which we place before the entire R.S.D.L. Party the following
minority opinion.  

“The tactics of boycotting the State Duma, which helped the mass of
the people to form a correct opinion of the impotence and lack of
independence of that institution, found complete justification in the
farcical legislative activities of the State Duma and in its dissolution.


“But the counter-revolutionary behaviour of the bourgeoisie and the
compromising tactics of the Russian liberals prevented the immediate
success of the boycott and compelled the proletariat to take up the
struggle against the landlord and bourgeois counter-revolution also on the
basis of the Duma campaign.  

“The Social-Democrats must wage this struggle outside the Duma and in
the Duma itself in order to develop the class-consciousness of the
proletariat, to further expose to the whole people the harmfulness of
constitutional illusions, and to develop the revolution.  

“In view of this state of affairs, and for the purposes mentioned
above, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party must take a most
energetic part in the present Duma campaign.  
 

“The principal objects of the Social-Democratic election and Duma
campaigns are: firstly, to explain to the people the uselessness of the
Duma as a means of satisfying the demands of the proletariat and the
revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, especially the peasantry. Secondly, to
explain to the people the impossibility of achieving political liberty by
parliamentary methods as long as the real power remains in the hinds of the
tsar’s government, and to explain the necessity of an armed uprising, of a
provisional revolutionary government and of a constituent assembly elected
by universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot. Thirdly, to
criticise the First Duma and reveal the bankruptcy of Russian liberalism,
and especially to show how dangerous and fatal it would be for the cause of
the revolution if the liberal-monarchist Cadet Party were to play the
predominant and leading role in the liberation movement.  

“As the class party of the proletariat, the Social-Democratic Party
must remain absolutely independent through out the election and Duma
campaigns, and here, too, must under no circumstances merge its slogans or
tactics with those of any other opposition or revolutionary party.  

“Therefore, at the first stage of the election campaign, i.e., before
the masses, it must as a general rule come out absolutely independently and
put forward only its own Party candidates.  

“Exceptions to this rule are permissible only in cases of extreme
necessity and only in relation to parties that fully accept the main
slogans of our immediate political struggle, i.e., those which recognise
the necessity of an armed uprising and are fighting for a democratic
republic. Such agreements, however, may only extend to the nomination of a
joint list of candidates, without in any way restricting the independence
of the political agitation carried on by the Social-Democrats.  

“In the workers’ curia the Social-Democratic Party must come out
absolutely independently and refrain from entering into agreements with any
other party.  

“At the higher stages of the election, i.e., at the assemblies of
electors in the towns and of delegates and electors in the countryside,
partial agreements may be entered into exclusively for the purpose of
distributing seats proportionately

    

to the number of votes cast for the parties entering the agreement. In this
connection, the Social-Democratic Party distinguishes the following main
types of bourgeois parties according to the consistency and determination
of their democratic views: (a) the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Polish
Socialist Party and similar republican
       parties[2]

;

(b) the Popular
Socialists{9} and the Trudoviks of a similar
type[3]

;

(c) the Cadets.”

The Second (First All-Russia) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. was held at Tammerfors from November 3 to 7 (16–20),
1906. It was attended by 32 delegates with vote: 11 from the Mensheviks, 7
from the Bund, 6 from the Bolsheviks, 5 from the Social-Democracy of the
Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, and 3 from the Social-Democracy of the
Latvian Territory. Members of the Central Committee and the Central Organ
Editorial Board at tended with voice only.  

The Conference adopted the following agenda: 1. Electoral
campaign. 2. Party Congress. 3. Labour Congress. 4. Struggle against the
Black Hundreds and the pogroms. 5. Partisan activity.  

The Menshevik C.C. secured a majority for the Mensheviks by bringing in
a number of fictitious organisations, which enabled them to impose
Menshevik resolutions on some questions. By 18 votes (Mensheviks and
Bundists) to 14, the Conference adopted the Menshevik resolution “On the
R.S.D.L.P.’s Tactics in the Electoral Campaign”, which allowed blocs with
the Cadets. To counter this opportunist resolution, Lenin motioned, on
behalf of 14 delegates, a “Minority Opinion”, the Bolshevik platform for
the electoral campaign, which emphasised the need for the working-class
party to be organisationally and ideologically independent. It allowed for
the possibility of temporary agreements only with the Trudoviks and the
S.R.s as representing petty-bourgeois democracy (pp. 188–91). Lenin
criticised the Menshevik draft electoral platform, which the C.C. submitted
for approval by the Conference, and motioned a number of amendments. Under
Bolshevik pressure, the Conference adopted a resolution introducing the
amendments.  

The Conference adopted a resolution “On Unity in the Electoral
Campaign in the Localities” with Lenin’s amendment, which put a curb on
the Menshevik C.C. in practising the tactics of setting up bloc with the
Cadets in the localities

(see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 322–23).



Lenin insisted on the need for an emergency Party congress. The
Conference decided to call the next congress not later than March 15 (28),
1907. Although the Bolsheviks demanded a discussion of the question of a
“labour congress”, believing agitation for it to be a violation of Party
discipline, the Conference did not discuss the question, confining itself
to a compromise resolution, “On the Limits of the Agitation for a Labour
Congress”.  

There was no time to discuss the questions of fighting the Black
Hundreds and the pogroms, or the partisan activity. The Conference
authorised the C.C. to issue a brief report on the Conference, containing
all the draft resolutions and minority opinions. But the Menshevik C.C., in
its organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, published only the Conference
resolutions, without the Bolsheviks’ “Minority Opinions”.  

Lenin analysed and criticised the work of the Conference in his “Blocs
With the Cadets” and “Party Discipline and the Fight Against the
Pro-Cadet Social-Democrats”

(see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 307–19 and 320–23).

p. 186





{5}

Lenin’s report was based on the Bolshevik resolution, later presented
at the Conference as a “Minority Opinion” on behalf of the delegates of
the Social-Democracy of Poland, the Latvian Territory, St. Petersburg,
Moscow, the Central Industrial Region and the Volga area (pp. 188–91).


The Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory—until 1906,
the Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Party—was set up in June 1904 at the
party’s First Congress. At the Second L.S.D.L.P. Congress in June 1905, the
party adopted its programme. From 1905 to 1907, the L.S.D.L.P. guided the
revolutionary action by the workers. Lenin said that “during the
revolution the Lettish proletariat and the Lettish Social-Democratic Party
occupied one of the first and most important places in the struggle against
the autocracy and all the forces of the old order”

(see present edition, Vol. 16, p. 260).



At the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1906, the
L.S.D.L.P. entered the R.S.D.L.P. as a territorial organisation, and after
the Congress was called the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory.

The Second Duma met on February 20 (March 5), 1907. The
elections to the Duma were indirect and unequal, and were held in an
atmosphere of reprisals and trials by military tribunals. Still, the Second
Duma turned out to be more Leftist than the First, the reason being the
more distinct demarcation between the parties than in the First Duma
period, the growing class consciousness of the masses and the participation
of the Bolsheviks in the elections.  

The Bolsheviks used the Duma as a rostrum for exposing tsarism and the
treacherous role of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, for proclaiming
and propagandising the Party’s revolutionary programme, for releasing the
peasantry from the influence of the liberals and creating a revolutionary
bloc in the Duma of representatives of the working class and the
peasantry. This was an entirely new, revolutionary Marxist line of
behaviour for proletarian delegates to take in a parliamentary
institution. Mean while, the Mensheviks pursued the opportunist line of
supporting the Cadets.  

By mid-1907, when it became obvious that the workers and peasants
lacked the strength to defeat tsarism, the tsarist government decided to
disperse the Duma. On the night of June 2 (15), 1907, the Social-Democratic
group, in the Duma was arrested, and the Duma itself dissolved by the
tsar’s decree the following day.

Zionist socialists—members of the Zionist Socialist Labour
Party, a petty-bourgeois Jewish nationalist organisation formed in
1904. They believed the main task of the Jewish proletariat to be a
struggle for obtaining their own territory and establishing a national
state. They preached class co-operation with the Jewish bourgeoisie, strove
to isolate Jewish workers from the revolutionary movement of the Russian
and international proletariat, and tried to sow hostile feelings among the
workers of different nationalities. The nationalistic activity of the
Zionist socialists served to obscure the class consciousness of the Jewish
workers and did great harm to the working-class movement.  

After the February 1917 bourgeois-democratic revolution, the Zionist
Socialist Labour Party merged with the Socialist Jewish Labour Party
(S.J.L.P.) to form the United Jewish Socialist Labour Party.

Popular Socialists (P.S.)—members of the petty-bourgeois
Trudovik Popular Socialist Party which in 1906 split away from the Right
wing of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (S.R.s). The Popular Socialists
favoured a bloc with the Cadets. Lenin used to call them “Social-Cadets”,
“philistine opportunists”, “S.R. Mensheviks”, vacillating between the
Cadets and the S.R.s, and emphasised that the party “differs very little
from the Cadets, for it deletes from its programme both republicanism and
the demand for all the land”

(see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 228).

It was headed by A. V. Peshekhonov, N. F. Annensky, V. A. Myakotin and
others.

As our readers will know from No. 9 of
Proletary{1}, the Menshevik Y. Larin has come out in his
pamphlet in favour of a non-Party labour congress and for a merger of the
Social-Democratic Party with the S.R.s, the P.P.S. and in general with all
“socialist” parties. Larin himself says that the number of members in the
S.R. Party is unknown. He adds that the Socialist-Revolutionaries estimate
their membership at 50,000–60,000. Saying that this could be an
exaggeration, Larin believes that the S.R.s must number at least 30,000.


We do not know where Larin got his figures of 50,000–60,000, for he
mentions no source. We have never come across such data in any
S.R. writings. The only fully published minutes of the First Congress of
the S.R. Party (December 1905) do not contain any data on the
S.R. Party’s membership. The fact is that no such data could have been
available, because elections to a party congress by all the members of the
party, proportional to a definite number of party members, have never been
held by any party in Russia except the Social-Democrats. The
Social-Democratic Party alone proclaimed this principle in November 1905 in
the newspaper Novaya Zhizn on behalf of the Bolshevik

    

C.C.,{2} and the All-Russia Conference of the Bolshevik Organisations
in December
1905{3} already consisted of representatives elected on the basis of
one for 300 Party members. Representation on this principle was first
applied to the whole Party at the Unity (Stockholm) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., with the controlling element in this case being the composition
of the Organising Committee for convoking the Congress: it was made up of
equal numbers of representatives from the two contending factions, the
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.  

So, where Larin got his maximum of 50,000–60,000 remains an absolute
mystery. However he used this figure (which is about one-third of the
membership of the R.S.D.L.P.) to suggest to readers that ma merger of the
two parties the Social-Democrats were fully assured of a preponderance over
the S.R.s. Larin’s mistake was already pointed out in a feuilleton in No. 9
of Proletary, which said that instead of “peace and positive
work” such a merger would actually result in growing dissension, to say
nothing of its being unacceptable for reasons of principle. Interesting
confirmation of what we then said came from an article by Léon Remy
in the French Socialist newspaper L’Humanité{4} on
December 17, 1906. Tribune
Russe,{5} the S.R. Party’s official organ abroad, quoted
Remy as saying that the “Council” of the S.R. Party “reckons the party
to have about 150,000 organised members, and if the concept of membership
is given a somewhat broader interpretation, such as that given to the Rules
by some regional committees, the figure is 200,000”.  

To enable readers to judge for themselves-how this curious figure was
obtained, we cite all the district data given in Remy’s
article. North-west—21,000; Volga area—14,000 (“almost double the
figure if all those accepting the party’s programme are included”);
Northern Caucasus—21,000; Transcaucasus—17,900; Centre—26,000
(including 5,000 in Moscow. It is odd that our Moscow comrades have been
unable to discern these 5,000 even through a magnifying glass);
North—20,000.  

Here is a problem for the reader to solve: who has displayed more
thoughtlessness—1) S.R.s, 2) Larin, or 3) Plekhanov and Axelrod?  
 

The picture is hardly improved if in this matter of a merger with the
S.R.s, the latter two disavow their ardent admirer Y. Larin. One need only
give thought to drawing a line of distinction between the “all-Russia
representatives” and the industrial workers and agricultural labourers,
farm hands or journeymen and peasants, artisans or craftsmen and working
men, etc.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

A reference to Lenin’s article “The Crisis of Menshevism” published
in No. 9 of Proletary on December 7 (20), 1906

(see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 341–64).



Proletary (Proletarian)—an illegal Bolshevik newspaper
published from August 21 (September 3), 1906, to November 28 (December 11),
1909, under the editorship of Lenin. Fifty issues appeared. Among those who
took an active part in the editorial work were M. F. Vladimirsky,
V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and I. F. Dubrovinsky; technical matters
were handled by A. G. Shlikhter and Y. S. Shlikhter, among others. The
first twenty issues were prepared for the press and set in Vyborg. In view
of the sharp worsening of conditions for the publication of an illegal
organ in Russia, the Proletary Editorial Board transferred the
paper’s publication abroad, in accordance with a decision of the
St. Petersburg and Moscow committees of the R.S.D.L.P. (Nos. 21–40 were
published in Geneva, and Nos. 41–50, in Paris).  

Proletary was in fact the Central Organ of the
Bolsheviks. Lenin carried out all the main work on its Board. More than 100
articles and notes by Lenin on the most important questions of the
working-class revolutionary struggle were published in the paper, which had
close contact with local Party organisations.  

During the years of the Stolypin reaction, Proletary played an
outstanding role in preserving and strengthening the Bolshevik

   

organisations and in fighting the liquidators, the otzovists-ultimatumists
and the god-builders.  

The paper ceased publication in accordance with the decisions of the
January 1910 Plenary Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.

p. 191





{2}

A reference to the C.C. appeal “To All Party Organisations and All
Social-Democratic Workers” on the convocation of the Fourth
R.S.D.L.P. Congress. It was adopted on Lenin’s proposal and published in
No. 9 of the newspaper Novaya Zhizn on November 19 (23), 1905 (see
K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh..., Part I, 1954,
pp. 96–98).  

Novaya Zhizn (New Life)—the first legal Bolshevik newspaper
published daily in St. Petersburg from October 27 (November 9) to
December 3 (16), 1905. Its official publisher and editor was the poet
N. M. Minsky, and the publisher, M. F. Andreyeva. When Lenin returned to
St. Petersburg from abroad in early November, the paper was edited by
him. There was a change in the Editorial Board and contributors. Novaya
Zhizn was in fact the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. Among those who
were most closely connected with the newspaper were M. S. Olminsky,
V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich. Maxim Gorky
took an active part in the paper and also gave it large financial
assistance. Among its foreign contributors were Rosa Luxemburg, Karl
Liebknecht, Marcel Cachin and Paul Lafargue. Fourteen of Lenin’s articles
appeared in the paper. In these articles, he defined the Party’s tasks and
tactics in the first Russian revolution.  

Novaya Zhizn was a champion of all the decisions and measures
of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee and played a great part in the
political enlightenment and organisation of the masses, mobilising them for
the armed uprising.  

In October 1905, Lenin wrote about Novaya Zhizn:
“Today the broadest tribune for our influence on the proletariat
is a daily newspaper in St. Petersburg”

(see present edition, Vol. 34, p. 365).



Novaya Zhizn was subjected to numerous reprisals. It was
closed down by the tsarist government after its No. 27 on December 2. The
last issue, No. 28, was published illegally.

A reference to the First Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. held at
Tammerfors (Finland) from December 12 to 17 (25–30), 1905. It was attended
by representatives of 26 organisations. Lenin was elected chairman of the
Conference. Among the participants were V. Y. Fridolin, L. M. Knipovich,
L. B. Krasin, N. K. Krupskaya, P. F. Kudelli, S. A. Lozovsky,
P. N. Mostovenko, V. I. Nevsky, V. A. Radus-Zenkovich, J. V. Stalin and
Y. M. Yaroslavsky. The Mensheviks were represented by E. L. Gurevich
(V. Danevich).  

The Conference had the following agenda: 1) Reports from the
localities. 2) Report on the current situation. 3) Organisational report of
the C.C. 4) On the merger of both parts of the R.S.D.L.P.  5) On
Reorganising the Party. 6) The agrarian question. 7) On the Duma.  


Lenin gave reports on the current situation and the agrarian
question. The Conference came out for restoring Party unity and merging the
practical centres of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks and their Central
Organs on a basis of equality, and also for mergers of parallel
organisations in the localities, authorising the united C.C. to call a
unity congress. In its resolution on “Party Reorganisation”, the
Conference recommended the practice of a broad electoral principle and the
principle of democratic centralism. Departures from the latter were
recognised as admissible only in the event of insuperable practical
obstacles. In the “Agrarian Resolution” (on Lenin’s report) the
Conference, elaborating the decisions of the Third Congress, proposed that
the point in the Party’s agrarian programme dealing with “cut-off lands”
should be replace d by the demand for the confiscation of all landed
estates and state and church lands. The Conference adopted a resolution on
an active boycott of the First Duma. In view of the fact that an armed
uprising had already started in Moscow, the Conference, on Lenin’s
proposal, hastily wound up its work, and the delegates went home to take
part in the uprising.

p. 192





{4}

L’Humanité—a daily founded in 1904 by Jaurès
as the organ of the French Socialist Party. In 1905, the paper welcomed the
revolution which had started in Russia, voicing the French people’s
solidarity with “the Russian nation creating its own 1789”. The newspaper
organised a collection of funds in aid of the Russian revolution. During
the First World War (1914–18) the paper was in the hands of the extreme
Right wing of the French Socialist Party and took a chauvinist stand.  

In 1918, Marcel Cachin, the outstanding leader of the French and
international working-class movement, became the paper’s political
director. From 1918 to 1920, the paper opposed the imperialist policy of
the French Government, which had sent its troops to fight against the
Soviet Republic. From December 1920, following the split in the French
Socialist Party and the formation of the Communist Party of France, the
paper became the latter’s Central Organ.

La Tribune Rune—a bulletin of the S.R. Party published in
Paris in French from January 1904 to December 1909 and from October 1912 to
July 1913; in 1904 it was published fortnightly and then monthly.

The rapporteur notes the absence in St. Petersburg of any Black-Hundred
danger tales of which are being spread about by the Cadets in order to
induce the electorate to vote for them. The local Social-Democrats are
faced with the question of how to release the masses of the population in
the capital from the ideological hegemony of the Cadets. Considerable
sections of the urban poor who are semi-proletarians keep wavering between
the Cadets and the Social-Democrats. The Cadets have been trying to bribe
them by promising seats in the Duma in order to reinforce their influence
on them. That is why it would, perhaps, be advisable to enter an agreement
with the revolutionary-democratic parties and groups so as to work together
to under mine the influence of the Cadets. The rapporteur believes that it
is up to the practical workers in the local organisation to decide on the
actual need and possibility of an agreement and also on its forms.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The City and Gubernia Conference of the St. Petersburg Organisation
of the R.S.D.L.P. met at Terioki on January 6 (19), 1907. It was
attended by 70 delegates with vote (42 Bolsheviks and 28 Mensheviks). Four
representatives of the Menshevik C.C. and C.O., one representative each
from the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. and from the Editorial
Board of the Bolshevik newspaper Proletary, and others attended
with voice only. When the credentials were verified, it turned out that in
some sub-districts, mainly represented by the Mensheviks, there had been
breaches of the resolution of the St. Petersburg Committee requiring

   

that elections of delegates to the Conference should be held only after
discussions by Party members of the question of whether agreements with the
Cadets ought to be concluded. The Conference regarded such credentials as
invalid. It rejected the proposal motioned by the representative of the
C.C. that the Conference should be divided into two sections (the city and
the gubernia) in accordance with the existing electoral districts, for the
proposal was aimed at giving the Mensheviks an artificial superiority at
the Conference. The Mensheviks used this decision as a pretext for breaking
with the revolutionary Social-Democrats and making a deal with the Cadets;
they walked out, splitting the St. Petersburg organisation on the eve of
the election.  

The other delegates decided to continue the Conference. Lenin gave the
report on Duma-electoral agreements, and after a debate the Conference
affirmed the “Minority Opinion” entered by the Bolsheviks at the Second
(First All-Russia) Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (pp. 188–91). The
Conference rejected the idea of forming a bloc with the Cadets and decided
to propose to the S.R.s and the Trudoviks an agreement for the election
period, provided they repudiated the idea of any alliance with the Cadets.


The Conference was described in detail in Lenin’s “The
Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections”, “\thinspace‘When You Hear the
Judgement of a Fool’ ...(From the Notes of a Social-Democratic
Publicist)”, “The Workers’ Party Election Campaign in St. Petersburg”,
“The Social-Democratic Election Campaign in St. Petersburg”, “The
Protest of the Thirty-One Mensheviks” et al.

(see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 431–55, 456–74, 426–30; Vol. 12,
pp. 15–23, 29–32).

What determines Social-Democratic policy?  

Essentially the class interests of the proletariat. Formally, the
decisions of Party congresses.  

Which are these decisions? First, the decisions of the Unity
(Stockholm) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. Second, the decisions of the
November All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., approved by the C.C.


What does the resolution of the Stockholm Congress instruct us
to do about the Duma?  

...(point 1, a) “strive to extend and sharpen these conflicts
(meaning the conflicts both between the government and the Duma, and
inside the Duma itself) to limits making it possible to use them as
starting-points for broad mass movements aimed at...” etc.  

Have the Mensheviks abided by this direction of the Congress? In the
matter of the presidium have they extended and sharpened the conflict
between the Duma Left wing and the Cadets?  

No, the Mensheviks have been committing a breach of the Congress’s
decision.  

Furthermore, in the same resolution the Congress directed:
“...that this intervention should be conducted in such a way as to make
these sharpening clashes: (a) reveal to the mass the inconsistency
of all the bourgeois parties which under take to act as spokesmen for the
people’s will in the Duma, and (b) bring the broad mass (the
proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie) to an
awareness that the Duma is totally useless”, etc.  

Consequently, the Mensheviks could, without risking anything at all, or
abandoning absolutely legal ground—the Mensheviks were duty-bound
to—show the mass, i.e., openly in the Duma, that the
Cadet presidium is a presidium of a party which has turned its
back on the revolution.  

What was the instruction to the Party contained in the resolution of
the November All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., which was approved by
the Central Committee and adopted by the 18 Menshevik delegates?  
 

“In its election campaign, the R.S.D.L.P., acting as an independent
class party of the proletariat, sets itself the aim... 2) to
explain to the masses that all hopes for a peaceful
outcome of the struggle for power are illusory.  

“...4) to stimulate the political activity of the masses and,
organising the forces of the revolution outside and
inside the Duma, to create conditions for transforming the latter into
a strongpoint of the revolution....”  

Starting from November 1906, the Mensheviks have moved so far over to
the right that they at once broke their own resolution. Their first step
tends to disorganise the “forces of the revolution” inside the
Duma, fortifying the masses in the hope of a peaceful outcome, for
a Cadet presidium elected by the entire Duma, without a protest from the
Left, would be an official nation-wide confirmation by the
Social-Democrats of the very hopes which they recognise as being
“illusory”.  

The Cadets have openly and totally turned away from the revolution. The
“forces of the revolution” are the Left, the Trudoviks, the S.R.s (the
revolutionary bourgeoisie) and the Social-Democrats. To help organise,
instead of disorganising, the “forces of the revolution” we are
duty-bound to tell the masses: the Social-Democrats support a
Left-wing, Trudovik presidium against the Cadets. In the event a Trudovik
presidium were elected and failed to live up to democratic hopes, we should
then use this to expose the democratic petty bourgeoisie before the mass,
thereby strengthening the conviction that the proletariat is the only
consistently democratic class.  

What did the C.C. tell the Party and the people when starting the
election campaign? We find that the official electoral platform of
the R.S.D.L.P. says: 

“...Citizens, the only men to elect to the Duma should be those who
not only want Russia to be free, but strive to help the
people’s revolution to win this freedom.... The First Duma failed to
do this. Its majority, led by the ‘people’s freedom’ party, had hoped to
secure freedom and land through peaceful negotiations with the
government.... That is why it is not meek petitioners that should be
elected to the Duma.... Citizens, elect revolutionary fighters who

    

will join you in carrying forward the great cause started in January,
October and December of last year.”  

What fine, grand words, fitting for the proletariat! What a pity that
for the Mensheviks they have turned out to be empty words.  

In their party electoral platform they condemned the
Cadet majority in the First Puma and its Cadet policies, but are now
helping artificially to restore Cadet hegemony in the Left-wing
Duma.

That same issue of Russkaya
Zhizn{3} carries Comrade L. Martov’s feuilleton in which he
returns to our editorial in
No. 2{1}

and, ignoring the explanation given by the group’s committee on this
matter, administers justice and metes out punishment.  

What does Comrade Martov wish to achieve by this strange step? If he
wants to challenge us to fight in this plane—in the plane of
personal attacks and suspicions—he is making a big mistake. We are not
going to follow him. We have a great deal too many essential
differences over which we shall have to conduct a principled
struggle in the group, in the press and in the Party, to allow ourselves to
be pushed into the dirt road of petty scores and squabbles. Good luck,
comrade, you can travel that road alone; we are not coming. We are glad to
let you have the honour of putting in the last word which is, in fact, the
very limit.

SPEECH AGAINST THE PROPOSAL TO CLOSE THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE
CONGRESS AGENDA{2} 
MAY 1 (14)

I object most strongly against the closure of the debate. You cannot
decide questions of principle mechanically by a simple vote.

SPEECH IN DEFENCE OF THE NAME-TICKET VOTE
METHOD{3}

MAY 2 (15)

Together with the representative of the Latvian delegation,
we insist on the preservation of the name-ticket voting procedure used
until today. It is the most democratic, saves time and ensures
clarity. There can be no question at all of rigging. Those who propose a
roll-call vote merely wish to drag things out, thereby making name-ticket
voting impossible.

SPEECHES  THE CHAIR AT THE SIXTH SITTING OF THE CONGRESS 
 MAY 3 (16)

I propose a vote of thanks to the representatives of the
British Social-Democratic Federation for their help in arranging the
Congress. (Applause.)  
2

I propose that we discuss the order of the items:
C.C. report, report by the Duma group, and attitude to bourgeois parties
and the Duma.  

A unanimous decision has been taken by the representatives of all
groups to arrange the other items in the following order: 

5) labour congress, 6) trade unions and the Party, 7) unorganised
action, 8) unemployment, the crisis and the lock-outs, 9) organisational
questions, 10) Stuttgart Congress, 11) work in the army, 12) miscellanea.

OBJECTION TO LIEBER’S AMENDMENT TO THE BOLSHEVIK RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE
CONGRESS ON THE ATTITUDE TO BOURGEOIS
PARTIES{4} 
 MAY 15 (28) 

Lieber is wrong. This shows up the worth of Lieber’s amendments. His is
a schoolboy statement, and it is characteristic of his lack of principle.

SPEECH ON DESIGNATING THE
CONGRESS{5} 
 MAY 19 (JUNE 1) 

I am surprised that the Mensheviks are afraid to call this the Fifth
Congress. Do they think that our history is any sort of secret?

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Fifth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in London from
April 30 to May 19 (May 13 to June 1), 1907. It was attended by 336
delegates representing more than 147,000 members: 105 Bolsheviks,
97 Mensheviks, 57 Bundists, 44 Polish Social-Democrats, 29 members of the
Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory, and 4 “non-faction”
delegates. The large industrial centres were represented by Bolsheviks. The
St. Petersburg Party organisation sent 12 Bolsheviks of its 17 delegates;
the Moscow City and Moscow District, 16 out of 19; the Urals, 19;
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Vladimir, Kostroma District, Bryansk, Kazan and
Krasnoyarsk, Bolsheviks only. Lenin was a delegate to the Congress from the
Upper

   

Kama organisation. At the Congress there was a well-knit group of
Bolsheviks led by Lenin, among them A. S. Bubnov, I. F. Dubrovinsky,
M. N. Lyadov, V. P. Nogin, M. N. Pokrovsky, K. N. Samoilova,
S. G. Shahumyan, J. V. Stalin, A. M. Stopani, I. A. Teodorovich,
M. G. Tskhakaya, K. Y. Voroshilov, and Y. M. Yaroslavsky. Maxim Gorky
attended the Congress with voice only. Following a long and sharp debate
the Congress adopt ed this agenda: 1) Report of the Central Committee. 2)
Report of the Duma group and its set-up. 3) Attitude to the bourgeois
parties. 4) The Duma. 5) “Labour congress” and non-Party labour
organisations. 6) Trade unions and the Party. 7) Partisan action. 8)
Unemployment, economic crisis and lockouts. 9) Organisational
questions. 10) International Congress at Stuttgart (May Day,
militarism). 11) Work in the army. 12) Miscellaneous. In view of the work
of the Congress being protracted, the questions of unemployment, of the
economic crisis and the lockouts, and the International Congress at
Stuttgart were taken off the agenda.  

Lenin was elected to the presidium of the Congress and chaired the 6th,
7th, 14th, 15th, 27th, 34th and 35th sittings; he gave the report and
delivered the summing-up speech on the key item of the agenda—the
attitude to the bourgeois parties; he also spoke on the C.C. report on its
work, the report on the Duma group activity, for inclusion in the agenda of
the general theoretical questions of the principles underlying the Party’s
tactics in the bourgeois revolution, against the Mensheviks, the Bundists
and Trotsky

(see present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 437–88).



At the Congress the Bolsheviks were supported by the delegates of the
Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and the
Social-Democrats of the Latvian Territory. Having rallied them on a
revolutionary platform, the Bolsheviks secured a majority and a victory for
the revolutionary Marxist line. The Congress adopted Bolshevik resolutions
on all major questions. It amended the Party Rules, eliminating the
two-centre arrangement (election of the C.C. and the C.O. by the
congress). Under the amended Rules, only the C.C. was elected, while the
C.O. was to be appointed by the C.C. and was to work under its control. The
Rules provided for periodical Party conferences to discuss the most
important aspects of Party life.  

To the Central Committee were elected five Bolsheviks, four Mensheviks,
two Polish Social-Democrats and one Latvian Social-Democrat; ten
Bolsheviks, seven Mensheviks, three Polish and two Latvian Social-Democrats
were elected alternate members. Among the Bolsheviks elected to the C.C. as
full and alternate members were V. I. Lenin, I. F. Dubrovinsky,
F. E. Dzerzhinsky, L. B. Krasin, J. Marchlewski, V. P. Nogin and
L. Tyszka. Three more persons were subsequently nominated for the C.C.: two
from the Bund and one from the Latvian Social-Democrats.  

As the C.C. leadership could not be reliable, for it consisted of
representatives of different trends (those of the non-Russian
Social-Democratic organisations frequently vacillated between the
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks), a Bolshevik Centre headed

   

by Lenin was elected at a sitting of the Bolshevik group towards the end of
the Congress. It included the Editorial Board of the newspaper
Proletary.  

The Fifth Congress marked a triumph for Bolshevism in the working-class
movement of Russia. Its decisions summed up the victory of Bolshevism over
the opportunist, Menshevik wing of the Party during the
bourgeois-democratic revolution. The Bolshevik tactics was approved as the
common one for the whole Party.

p. 197





{2}

Lenin spoke at the third sitting. Following the adoption of the first
two items of the agenda, 1. Report of the Central Committee, and 2. Report
of the Duma group and its set-up, the Bundist Zeltser (B. N. Grosser)
joined Lieber in motioning that there should be no debate on the general
theoretical questions of principle, motioned for inclusion in the agenda
(items 3, 4 and 5 of the Bolshevik draft agenda—the aggravation of the
economic struggle and the current situation, the class tasks of the
proletariat at the present stage, and the attitude to the bourgeois
parties). The Bundist Vinitsky (V. D. Medem) who was in the chair motioned
a closure of the debate.  

After Lenin’s speech at the following, fourth, sitting, the debate on
the inclusion of the general theoretical questions in the agenda was
continued. At the fifth sitting on May 2 (15), the item “On the Attitude
to the Bourgeois Parties” was included in the agenda.

p. 197





{3}

Point 4 of the regulations adopted by the Congress provided for a
name-ticket vote only when at least 20 delegates demanded one. Lenin spoke
in connection with the fact that a proposal had been made to the presidium
of the Congress to have the roll-call vote without tickets. By 3 votes to 2
the presidium came out against the tickets, but in view of the differences
that arose, the question was referred to the Congress. A majority (144)
were in favour of the name-ticket vote.

p. 197





{4}

Lieber’s amendment opened the attack by the Menshevik Bundist
opportunist section of the Congress against the Bolshevik resolution on the
attitude to the bourgeois parties, which had been adopted as a
basis. Lieber motioned the deletion of the first part of the theoretical
resolution: “At present, Social-Democracy is most insistently faced with
the task of determining the class content of the various non-proletarian
parties, of taking account of the present interrelation of classes and
accordingly of defining its attitude to the other parties”. Lieber’s
amendment was reject ed by the Congress. For the amendments to the
resolution on “The Attitude Towards Bourgeois Patties”, see present
edition, Vol. 12, pp. 500–05.

p. 198





{5}

Lenin is replying to F. I. Dan, who objected to designating the
Congress as the Fifth, as the Bolsheviks had proposed, on the plea that it
was an effort to fix the factional dissentions. Actually, however, the
Mensheviks and the Bundists had ignored the Third,

   

Bolshevik, Congress. The Congress adopted the proposal of the Bundist
Shanin (L. G. Shapiro) to designate it as the “London Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P.”

Considering: 

1) that because of the drawn-out economic crisis through which Russia
is now going, and in connection with the extreme intensification of
government reaction, there is a marked sharpening of class struggle between
the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and also a deepening and extension of
the peasants’ struggle against the old system; 

2) that this last year of the revolution has been marked by a rapid
growth of the political awareness of all classes, a strengthening of the
wing parties, a decline of constitutional illusions, a weakening of the
“centre”, i.e., the liberal parties, striving to stop the revolution by
means of concessions acceptable to the Black-Hundred landowners and the
autocracy; 

3) that the class interests of the proletariat in the bourgeois
revolution demand the creation of conditions which would open up the
possibility for the broadest struggle against the propertied classes, for
socialism; 

4) that the only way to create these conditions is to win a democratic
republic, full popular power and the minimum of social and economic demands
necessary for the proletariat (8–hour working day and other demands of the
Social-Democratic minimum programme); 
 

5) that the proletariat alone is capable of carrying the democratic
revolution to the end, provided that, as the only consistently
revolutionary class in contemporary society, it leads the mass of peasants
in a relentless struggle against the landowners’ estates and the
serf-owning state, 

the Congress recognises: 

a) that the main task of the proletariat at the current historical
moment is to carry the democratic revolution in Russia forward to the end;


b) that any minimisation of this task inevitably results in the working
class being transformed from the leader of the people’s revolution carrying
with it the mass of the democratic peasantry, into a passive participant in
the revolution tailing behind the liberal bourgeoisie; 

c) that while supporting the implementation of this task with all its
strength, the Social-Democratic Party should never lose sight of the
proletariat’s independent, socialist aims.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The draft resolution of the Second Congress of the Social-Democracy of
the Latvian Territory, “On the Tasks of the Proletariat at the Current
Stage of the Bourgeois-Democratic Revolution”, written by Lenin, was
annexed, without debate, to the minutes of the Congress and published in
No. 78 of the newspaper Zihna on July 7, 1907. The minutes of the
Congress have not been preserved.  

The Second Congress of the Social-Democracy of the Latvian
Territory was held in London from May 21 to 25 (June 3 to 7), 1907,
just after the Fifth (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. By then there were
almost 13,000 organised Party members. The Congress was attended by 26
delegates with vote and 10 with voice only. The agenda was: 1) Reports of
the Central Committee, of the Auditing Committee and local
organisations. 2) Crises, lockouts and unemployment. 3) On the tasks of the
proletariat at the present moment of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution. 4) On agitation in the army. 5) On the trade unions. 6) On
propaganda and agitation. 7) Organisational questions, etc. The agrarian
question had been removed from the agenda, evidence of the erroneous
attitude of the Latvian Social-Democrats.  

At the Congress there was a sharp struggle between the revolutionary
Social-Democrats and the opportunists, especially on the C.C. report.  

Lenin took an active part in the work of the Congress. At the afternoon
sitting on May 24 (June 6), 1007, he gave a report on the tasks of the
proletariat at the present moment of the bourgeois-democratic revolution
(there is a very bad record of the report—a retranslation from the
Latvian into Russian made at the Police Department). The Congress showed
that Bolshevism had won strong positions in Latvia: it adopted Bolshevik
decisions on the question of the trade unions, unemployment, and democratic
and military organisations.  

The Congress elected a new Central Committee, consisting in the main of
revolutionary Social-Democrats, and authorised the C.C. to publish a
manifesto “To the Latvian Proletariat”, drawn up in the Bolshevik spirit.


Zihna (Cina) (Struggle)—the Central Organ of the
Latvian Social-Democrats, founded in March 1904. It was published illegally
in Riga at big intervals until August 1909, and then abroad. On the
occasion of its hundredth issue in 1910, it carried an article by Lenin,
“The Jubilee Number of Zihna”, giving a high appraisal of the
revolutionary activity of the Latvian Social-Democrats

(see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 260–64).

The paper also carried a number of Party documents written by Lenin. Among
its constant and active contributors were P. I. Stu&chatka, one of the
organisers of the Communist Party of Latvia, and the popular poet
J. Rainis.  

From April 1917, the newspaper was published legally in Petrograd, Riga
and elsewhere, and from August 1919, when the

   

counter-revolution temporarily won out in Latvia, it was again published
illegally in Riga. After the establishment of the Soviet power in June
1940, the paper became the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of Latvia and the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Republic.

Accordingly, the Congress considers it to
be the duty of the working class and especially of its representatives in
the parliaments, in View of the class character of bourgeois society, to
use every means to struggle against and to deny appropriations for the
aggressive policy of states, and to act in such a way as to educate
working-class youth in the spirit of socialism and an awareness of the
brotherhood of nations.*)
 . . .  

*) The Russian amendment also had this provision:
“in such a way that the ruling classes would not dare to use it (youth) as
an instrument to consolidate their class domination against the fighting
proletariat”. These words were deleted by the commission not because
anyone disagreed

    

with them in principle, but because they were regarded by the Germans as
being illegal and capable of providing a pretext for the dissolution of
German Social-Democratic organisations. This abridgement did not alter the
essential meaning of the corresponding passage of the resolution.

 . . .  

In the event of a danger of war, the working class and
its parliamentary representatives in the countries concerned must, relying
on the support of the international Bureau, do everything they can to
prevent a declaration of war, by every means which they consider
reasonable, and the choice of which depends on the degree of
aggravation of the class struggle and the general political
situation.*)
 . . .  

*) The Russian amendment said that these means (to prevent war) are
changed and intensified (sich \"andern und steigern)
depending on the aggravation of the class struggle, etc. The commission
deleted “intensified”, leaving only “changed”.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart (the Seventh
Congress of the Second International) was held from August 18 to 24, 1907.


The Congress was attended by 886 delegates representing socialist
parties and trade unions. The German delegation was especially numerous
(289 persons), most of them trade union officials, a fact which had a
strong effect on the stand of the German Social-Democratic Party in the
discussion and adoption of the Congress resolutions.  

The delegation from Russia consisted of 37 Social-Democrats, 24 S.R.s
and 7 trade unionists. On the Bolshevik delegation were V. I. Lenin,
A. A. Bogdanov, I. P. Goldenberg (Meshkovsky), B. A. Knunyants,
M. M. Litvinov, A. V. Lunacharsky, N. A. Semashko and M. Tskhakaya.  

The Congress examined the following questions: 1) Militarism and
international conflicts. 2) Relations between political parties and trade
unions. 3) Colonial question. 4) Immigration and emigration of workers. 5)
Women’s suffrage.  

Lenin held several conferences of Bolshevik delegates to define their
line in the Social-Democratic section, in the Russia delegation and at the
Congress; he took part in the meetings of the Social-Democratic section,
where he fought the opportunist line of the Mensheviks, and in the meetings
of the Russia delegation, where he defended the R.S.D.L.P. stand against
the S.R.s.  

During the Congress, Lenin carried out a great deal of work in uniting
the Left-wing forces in international Social-Democracy, resolutely fighting
the opportunists and revisionists. The conferences he organised with
Left-wingers (Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Tyszka, Georg Ledebour and
others) were the first step in rallying the revolutionary Marxists.  

The work of the Congress was concentrated in the committees, which
drafted the resolutions for the Plenary Meetings. Lenin took part in the
work of the committee on “Militarism and International Conflicts”. In the
discussion of the draft resolution motioned by August Bebel, Lenin proposed
amendments, which were supported by the Polish Social-Democrats, and
secured a basic change in the draft in the spirit of revolutionary Marxism.


There was an acute struggle on the colonial question. The opportunist
majority of the committee, headed by die Dutch “socialist” Van Kol,
motioned an opportunist draft resolution which was supported by a majority
of the German delegation. The resolution on the colonial question adopted
by the Congress denounced all colonial policy straightforwardly and without
reservations.  

The Congress adopted a resolution on the immigration and emigration of
workers, which met the demands of the revolutionary

   

Social-Democrats, and of the internationalist education of workers in all
countries.  

Lenin attached great importance to the adoption by the Congress of a
resolution on the relations between the trade unions and the political
party of the working class. In the committee Lenin’s line on the
partisanship of the trade unions was supported by A. V. Lunacharsky. On
this, question, contrary to the efforts of the Right wing, the Congress
adopted a resolution confirming the principle of partisanship of the trade
unions.  

For Lenin’s articles on the Stuttgart Congress see present edition,
Vol. 13, pp. 75–93.

. . .  

*) This article is a translation of an editorial in the German
Social-Democratic fortnightly Die Gleichheit
(Equality),{2} which is edited by Clara Zetkin and is the organ of the
women’s labour movement in Germany. The assessment of the Stuttgart
Congress is here given with remarkable correctness and talent: clear,
concise and bold propositions sum up the tremendous ideological context of
the Congress debates and resolutions. For our part, we add several notes to
this article to indicate to the Russian reader some facts coming from the
West-European socialist press, facts largely distorted by our Cadet and
semi-Cadet newspapers

    

(like
Tovarishch{3}), which have told many lies about the Stuttgart
Congress.

 . . .  

The question of relations between the Social-Democrats
and the trade unions went best to show the unanimity of class-conscious
proletarians of all countries. No one any longer objected in principle
against the basic historical tendency of the proletarian class
struggle—to connect as closely as possible the political and the economic
struggle, and also organisations in both, into a single force of the
socialist working class. Only the representative of the Russian
Social-Democrats, Plekhanov, and the majority of the French delegation fell
back on rather unsatisfactory arguments *) in an effort to justify some
restrictions on this principle by referring to the special conditions
prevailing in their countries.
 . . .  

*) The Russian Social-Democratic delegation in Stuttgart had a
preliminary discussion of the questions in sub stance with a view to
appointing its representatives to the commission. In the commission on
relations between the trade unions and the socialist parties, Plekhanov did
not represent all the Russian Social-Democrats, but only the
Mensheviks. Plekhanov went into the commission to stand up for the
principle of “neutrality”. The Bolsheviks sent Voinov to the
commission and he stood up for the Party’s view, i.e., the
decision in the spirit of the London Congress against neutrality, and for
the closest contacts between the trade unions and the Party. Consequently,
Clara Zetkin regarded as “unsatisfactory” the arguments not of
the R.S.D.L.P. representative, but of the representative of the Menshevik
opposition in the R.S.D.L.P.

 . . .  

And here, ultimately, the revolutionary energy and
indomitable faith of the working class in its own fighting capacity won
out, on the one hand, over the pessimistic credo of its own impotence and
hidebound stand for the old and exclusively parliamentary methods of
struggle, and on the other, oversimplified anti-militarist sport of the
French semi-anarchists à la Hervé.*)
 . . .  

*) The author of the article, while contrasting the two deviations from
socialism rejected by the Congress: Hervé’s semi-anarchism, and
opportunism, included in the “exclusively parliamentary” forms of
struggle, fails to name any spokesmen of this opportunism. In the
commission of the

    

Stuttgart Congress, on the question of militarism, the same antithesis was
made by Vandervelde when he objected to the opportunist speech of
Vollmar. Vollmar hints at Hervé’s expulsion, said Vandervelde, but I
protest, against this and warn Vollmar, because the expulsion of the
extreme Left wingers would suggest the idea of expelling the extreme
Right-wingers (Vollmar is one of the most “Rightist” German
opportunists).

 . . .  

Finally, on the question of women’s suffrage as well,
the sharply principled class standpoint, which regards women’s suffrage as
nothing but an organic part of the proletariat’s class right and class
cause, won out over the opportunist bourgeois view which hopes to wheedle
out of the ruling classes a mutilated and curtailed suffrage for
women.*)
 . . .  

*) At the Congress in Stuttgart, this bourgeois stand point was backed
only by an Englishwoman from the Fabian Society (a quasi-socialist
organisation of British intellectuals taking an extremely opportunist
stand).

 . . .  

At the same time, the Congress—confirming the
resolution of the International Women’s Conference on this point—stated
unequivocally that in their struggle for suffrage the socialist parties
must put forward and uphold the principled demand for women’s suffrage,
regardless of any “considerations of convenience”.*)
 . . .  

*) A hint at the Austrian Social-Democrats. Both at the International
Socialist Women’s Conference and in the Congress committee dealing with the
women’s question, there was a polemic between the German and the Austrian
Social-Democratic women. Clara Zetkin had earlier reproached the Austrian
Social-Democrats in the press for pushing into the background the demand
for women’s suffrage in their agitation for electoral rights. The
Austrians put up a very lame defence, and Victor Adler’s amendment, which
very cautiously conducted “Austrian opportunism” in this question, was
rejected in the commission by 12 votes to 9.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

At the Stuttgart Congress, Lenin first met and got to know Clara
Zetkin, who, together with other Left-wing German Social-Democrats, stood
up for the tactics of revolutionary Marxism, and opposed the opportunists
and revisionists.  

A translation of Clara Zetkin’s article “International Socialist
Congress in Stuttgart” was edited by Lenin, who also supplied the notes,
explaining the questions on which there had been a struggle against the
opportunist section of the Congress delegates.  

Clara Zetkin’s article was published in the Bolshevik miscellany
Zarnitsy (Summer Lightning).

It will be recalled that the International Socialist
Congress in Stuttgart discussed the question of militarism and in
connection with it the question of anti-militarist propaganda. The
resolution adopted on the point says, in part, that the Congress regards it
as a duty of the working classes to “help to have working class youth
brought up in a spirit of international brotherhood and socialism and
imbued with class consciousness”. The Congress regards this as aft earnest
of the army ceasing to be a blind instrument in the hands of the ruling
classes, which they use as they see fit and which they can direct against
the people at any time.  

It is very hard, sometimes almost impossible, to conduct propaganda
among soldiers on active service. Life in the barracks, strict supervision
and rare leave make contact with the outer world extremely difficult;
military discipline and the absurd spit arid polish cow the soldier. Army
commanders do everything they can to knock the “nonsense” out of the
“brutes”, to purge them of every unconventional thought and every human
emotion and to instil in them a sense of blind obedience and an unthinking
wild hatred for “internal” and “external” enemies.... It is much harder
to make an approach to the lone, ignorant and cowed soldier who is isolated
from his fellow-men and whose head has been stuffed with the wildest views
on every possible subject, than to draft-age young men living with their
families and friends and closely bound up with them by common
interest. Everywhere anti-militarist propaganda among young workers has
yielded excellent results. That is of tremendous importance. The worker who
goes into the army a class-conscious Social-Democrat is a poor support for
the powers that be.  

There are young socialist workers’ leagues in all European
countries. In some, for instance, Belgium, Austria and Sweden, these
leagues are large-scale organisations carrying on responsible party
work. Of course, the main aim of the youth leagues is self-education and
the working out of

    

a distinct and integrated socialist outlook. But the youth leagues also
carry on practical work. They struggle for an improvement in the condition
of apprentices and try to protect them from unlimited exploitation by their
employers. The young socialist workers’ leagues devote even more time and
attention to anti-militarist propaganda.  

For that purpose, they try to establish close ties with young
soldiers. This is done in the following way. Before the young worker has
joined the army, he is a member of a league and pays membership dues. When
he becomes a soldier, the league continues to maintain constant contacts
with him, regularly sending him small cash aids (“soldier’s sous” as they
call them in France), which, however small, are of substantial importance
to the soldier. For his part, he undertakes to provide the league with
regular information about everything that goes On in his barracks and to
write about his impressions. Thus, even after he joins the army, the
soldier dots not break off his ties with the organisation of which he was a
member.  

An effort is always made to drive the soldier as far away from home as
possible for his service. This is done with the intention of preventing the
soldier from being tied with the local population by any interest, and to
make him feel alien to it. It is theft easier to make him carry out orders:
to shoot at a crowd. Young workers’ leagues try to bridge this alienation
between the soldier and the local population. Youth leagues are connected
with each other. When he arrives in a new town, the soldiers a former
member of a youth league at home, is met by the local league as a welcome
visitor, and he is at once brought into the circle of local interests and
helped in every possible way. He ceases to be a new-coiner and a
stranger. He is also aware that if any misfortune befalls him he will
receive help and support. This awareness adds to his courage, he gains
assurance in his behaviour in the barracks, and is bolder in standing up
for his rights and his human dignity.  

Their close ties with young soldiers enable the youth leagues to carry
on extensive anti-militarist propaganda among the soldiers. This is done
mainly with the aid of anti-militarist literature, which the youth leagues
publish and circulate in great quantities, especially in France,

    

Belgium and also in Switzerland, Sweden, etc. This literature is highly
diverse: postcards with anti-militarist pictures, anti-militarist army
songs (many of these songs are very popular among the soldiers),
“soldier’s catechism” (in France it was circulated in more than 100,000
copies), all sorts of pamphlets, leaflets, appeals; weekly, fortnightly and
monthly newspapers and magazines for soldiers, some of them
illustrated. Barracks, Recruit, Young Soldier, Pju pju (a pet name
for the young recruit), and Forward are very widely
circulated. For example, in Belgium the newspapers Recruit and
Barracks have a printing of 60,000 copies each. Especially many
magazines are published at the time of the draft. Special issues of
soldiers’ newspapers are mailed to the homes of all
recruits. Anti-militarist literature is delivered to soldiers in the
barracks and handed out to them in the streets; soldiers find it in
coffee-houses and pubs, and everywhere else they go.  

Recruits receive special attention. They are given a ceremonial
send-off. During the recruitment, processions are staged in the towns. In
Austria, for instance, recruits walk through the town dressed in mourning
and to the strains of funeral marches. In front of them rolls a decorated
red carriage. All the walls are plastered with red posters which say in
large letters: “You will not shoot at the people!” Evening parties with
ardent anti-militarist speeches are held in honour of the recruits. In
short, everything is done to awaken the recruit’s consciousness, to ensure
him against the evil influence of the ideas and emotions which will be
instilled into him in the barracks by fair means and foul.  

The work of the socialist youth is not in vain. In Belgium, there are
almost 15 soldiers’ unions in the army, which are mostly affiliated with
the Social-Democratic Labour Party and are closely allied with each
other. In some regiments, two-thirds of the soldiers are organised. In
France, the anti-militarist mood has become massive. During the strikes at
D\"unkirchen, Creusot, Loguivi, Monso-le-Min the soldiers ordered against
the strikers declared their solidarity with the workers....  

As time goes on, there are more and more Social-Democrats in the army
and the troops become increasingly less reliable. When the bourgeoisie has
to confront the organised

    

working class, whom will the army back? The young socialist workers are
working with all the enthusiasm and energy of the young to have the army
side with the people.

In No. 5 of Znamya
Truda,{1} the Central Organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, we
find an editorial on the Stuttgart Congress, which is Written in a torrent
of words and immoderate boasting, the habitual style of the S.R.s. There is
a reprint of the telegram in which the C.C. of the S.R. Party informed
Europe that “the revolutionary struggle commands it to remain at its
post”. The selfsame C.C. voices its complete satisfaction over the “usual
energy” displayed by the Socialist-Revolutionary representative in the
Bureau.{2} “By its resolution, the Socialist International endorsed
the view of the trade union movement which we have always supported,”
Znamya Truda assures us. Despite the dogmatist Kautsky, the
Congress “turned out to be on our side” on the question of a legislative
introduction of a minimum wage. Within three years, “we Russian socialists
have grown into a great mass party, a fact the International has openly and
respectfully (!!!) recognised”.  

In short, thirty thousand couriers were dispatched from Europe to pay
their respects to the Socialist-Revolutionaries.  

Meanwhile, the malignant Social-Democrats carried on with their “petty
intrigues” in the Russian section, namely, they fought against the
equality of votes for the S.D.s and the S.R.s which the
Socialist-Revolutionaries demanded. The Social-Democrats demanded 11 votes
for themselves, 6 for the Socialist-Revolutionaries and 3 for the trade
unions. The Bureau resolved: 10 for the S.D.s, 7 for the S.R.s and 3 for
the trade unions. “Adler and Bebel, who voted against our demand, declared
that they had no wish at all to minimise

    

the importance of the S.R. Party, which they recognised as an important
factor of Russian socialism and the revolution. But they wanted to be fair
and to state the approximate balance of forces” (Znamya Truda).


Our
Khlestakovs{3} are imprudent, oh so imprudent! There was not and
could not have been any question in the Bureau either of the
significance of the S.R.s, or of the “important factor”. Once a party has
been admitted to the Congress and the Bureau, the Bureau and its members
will not bother to assess its significance and importance. The only thing
the Bureau can assess is the strength of the par ties for
apportioning the votes. Bebel and Adler agreed with the arguments of our
Social-Democratic representative in the Bureau that the S.D.s and the S.R.s
are not equal in strength. Having agreed with these arguments,
they naturally noted that they were not passing judgement either on
principles or trends, that they were not deciding on the dispute between
the S.D. and the S.R. programmes, but were merely weighing their strength
for apportioning the votes. It is entirely in the Khlestahov Spirit to
interpret this self-evident reservation to mean recognition of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries as “an important factor”.  

The S.R.s are being doubly imprudent when, in reporting from memory and
distorting the meaning of Bebel and Adler’s reservation, they say nothing
at all about the arguments on the substance of the case. They give
us Bebel’s reservations with embellishments, but are silent on the
substance of our dispute. Why is that so?  

In substance, our representatives in the Bureau had the following
argument. The Social-Democrat referred to the number of deputies in the
Second Duma as the most precise criterion of party strength, adding that
the electoral law favoured the peasants over the workers. The S.R. replied
that apart from the S.R. group there were some near-S.R.s in the Duma—the
Trudoviks and the Popular Socialists. A portion of them, he implied, should
be added to the S.R.s! Besides, the Popular Socialists have some
“first-class writers” (“écrivains de premier ordre”, said
Rubanovich). Those were the Socialist-Revolutionary’s very words.  

To this the S.D. representative replied: indeed, the Popular Socialists
do have some “first-class writers” as do the

    

French Radical-Socialists and the
Radicals,{4} say, a man like Clemenceau (also a “first-class
writer”). But is it proper for an independent party to refer to
another party as evidence of its own strength? Is it proper, when
the “first-class writers” among the Popular Socialists have not the
slightest intention of requesting admission to the Congress?  

Is it proper, let us add, to present oneself as an ultra-revolutionary
in Russia and to drag along the Popular Socialists for help in Europe?

The Third
Duma,{1} convened on the basis of the electoral law which was
promulgated by the tsar after the dissolution of the Second Duma on June 3,
1907, opened on November 1, 1907. The old electoral law, issued en
December 11,
1905,{2} was a far cry from universal, direct, and equal suffrage by
secret ballot, and distorted the will of the people, turning the Duma into
an ugly expression of that will—especially after the “interpretation”
of the law given in the second Duma by the Senate, consisting of old civil
servants and justices entirely subservient to the tsarist autocracy. On
June 3, the tsar deprived the workers, peasants and urban poor of the
trifling electoral rights they had enjoyed. In this way, the autocracy
committed another heinous crime against the people by forging popular
representation and handing the Duma over to the landowners and capitalists,
the mainstay of the tsarist autocracy and the age-old oppressors of the
people. That they would dominate the Duma could have been predicted. That
is exactly what happened.  

At present, returns are in on the election of 439 members of the
Duma. The eight non-party members aside, the other 431 belong to
four main groups: 1) the largest—the Right wingers,
Black-Hundred deputies, numbering 187; 2) then the
Octobrists{3} and parties close to them, numbering 119;

    

3) the Cadets and like-minded men, 93; 4) the Left-wingers, 32 (of them, 16
to 18 Social-Democrats).  

Everyone knows who the Black-Hundred men are. It is true that among
their adherents there is a section of ignorant, unclass-conscious workers,
peasants and urban poor, but their governing core consists of feudal-minded
landowners, for whom the preservation of the autocracy is the only
salvation, because it alone can help them to plunder the public till,
receiving grants, loans, good salaries and handouts of every sort; the
autocracy with its police and army alone gives them the possibility of
keeping in bondage the peasantry, which suffers from lack of land and is
fettered with labour services and irredeemable debts and arrears.  

The Octobrists also include landowners, mainly those who engage in
large-scale sales of grain from their estates and require the patronage of
the autocracy to secure lower customs tariffs on their grain abroad, to
keep down the costs of transporting the grain abroad by Russian railroad
and to secure the best possible prices from the treasury when it purchases
the alcohol, which many landowners produce from potatoes and grain at their
distilleries, for the vodka monopoly. But apart from these predatory and
greedy land owners, many of the Octobrists are equally predatory and greedy
capitalist manufacturers, factory-owners and bankers. They, too, are in
need of the government’s patron age to secure high tariffs on foreign
goods, so that Russian goods could be sold at three times their price, to
secure fat contracts from the treasury for the capitalist factories,
etc. They want the police and the army to turn the workers into the same
sort of slaves that the peasants are under the feudal-minded landowners.


Naturally, the Octobrists are very close to the Black Hundred
men. Should the Duma examine government revenue and expenditure—they will
put their heads together to see that the full burden of the taxes falls on
the peasants, the workers and the urban poor, while the revenues go into
the pockets of the capitalists, the landowners and senior civil
servants. Should the question arise of allocating land to the peasants or
improving the condition of the workers—the Black-Hundred men and the
Octobrists will pull together to sell, at a threefold price, only those
lands which they

    

do not need, stripping the peasants, impoverished as they are, of
everything they have; they will try very hard to fetter the hands and feet
of the workers, who are already hard pressed by the burden of capitalist
exploitation. And, of course, both the Black-Hundred men and the Octobrists
will strain very hard to have the largest possible police and army to
provide protection for their “precious” life and their “sacrosanct”
property: after all, they fear the revolution like the plague, they are
terrified by the prospect of a mighty drive by the workers and peasants
rising to the great struggle for liberty and land. Together the
Octobrists and the Black-Hundred men will constitute a vast majority in the
Third Duma: 306 out of 439 members. This majority can do just what it
wants. It is against the revolution, or, as the more common saying is, it
is counter-revolutionary.  

But there may be questions on which the Octobrists will differ with the
majority of the Black Hundreds. The latter’s effrontery knows no
bounds. They are sure that the police truncheon, the whip, the machine-gun
and the bayonet alone will put down any revolution, any popular urge for
light and freedom. They would like to rely on the autocracy and do as they
wish with the public revenue, using it for their own benefit, taking over
all the lucrative posts and treating the country as their own estate. The
Octobrists remember that up to now the landowners and the civil servants
have run things in a way that gave them every thing and left hardly enough
for the capitalists. Two plunderers—a Black-Hundred man and an
Octobrist—quarrel over a succulent titbit, over who is to get more. The
Octobrists refuse to let the Black Hundreds have everything or even the
greater share: just recently, the Japanese war gave them an object lesson,
making them realise that the Black Hundreds bungled things in such a way
that they inflicted losses even on themselves, to say nothing of the
capitalists and the merchants. That is why the Octobrists want to take over
some of the power in the state and wish to frame the constitution for their
own benefit and, naturally, not for the benefit of the people. In so doing
the Octobrists want to deceive the people by diverse laws which have the
appearance of introducing reforms and improving things for the state and
the people, but actually serve the

    

interests of the rich. Like the Black Hundreds, they are of course prepared
to rely on the machine-gun, the bayonet and the whip against the
revolution, but to be on the safe side they want to seal the ayes of the
masses with the aid of fraudulent reforms.  

To do all this, the Octobrists need allies other than the Black
Hundreds. It is true that in these matters as well they hope to detach a
section of the Right Wing from the ultra-Black hundreds of the Union of the
Russian
People,{4} but that is not enough. That is why they have to seek for
other allies who are also hostile to the revolution, but who are enemies of
the Black Hundreds, favour fraudulent or petty reforms, and support the
constitution in the interests of the big and possibly a section of the
middle bourgeoisie.  

It is easy for the Octobrists to find such allies in the Duma:
they are the Cadets, a party of that section of the landowners, the big and
middle bourgeoisie which has quite adapted itself to conducting a really
good Capitalist economy, like that in the West-European countries, and
based likewise on the exploitation and oppression of the workers, the
peasants and the urban poor, but an exploitation which is clever, subtle
and artful, an exploitation you do not see right through all at once. There
are many landowners in the Cadet Party engaged in real capitalist
operations, and similar factory-owners and bankers, many lawyers?
professors and doctors with good incomes, derived from the rich. It is true
that in their programme the Cadets promised the people a great many things:
there was universal suffrage and all the freedoms, an 8–hour working day,
and land for the peasants. But all that was said merely to attract the
masses of people, for they never actually made any straightforward proposal
for universal suffrage even in the first two Dumas; their bills on the
freedoms were in fact aimed at giving the people as little freedom as
possible; in the Second Duma they proposed a 10–hour day instead of the
8–hour day, and they were prepared to let the peasants have land which was
of no use to the capitalist economy, and which carried redemption payments,
and let them have so little of it that even if the peasants got it, they
would still have to work for a wage on the neighbouring

    

landowners? estates. That was a clever trick to which the workers did not
rise at all, very few peasants did and only some of the urban poor actually
took the Cadets at their word. Today, after the dissolution of the two
Dumas, the Cadets have grown very quiet and are making up to the
Octobrists: they declared that they regard the revolutionaries and
especially the Social-Democrats as their enemies, and, believing the
Octobrists to be constitutional-minded, voted for an Octobrist to fill the
post of Duma Chairman. The deal is ready. It is true that Minister Stolypin
does not apparently want a permanent deal and wants to keep the Cadets in
submission, thereby exerting an influence on the Octobrists, but in
practice there will still be constituted another majority in the Duma—the
Octobrists and the Cadets. Together they number 212, slightly less
than half, but they will also have the non-party men behind them, and these
number 8, so that the majority will be there; and even among the Rightists
some might vote with the Octobrists and the Cadets on some questions. Of
course, this other majority will also be counter-revolutionary and
will fight against the revolution; it will merely covet up with trifling
reforms which are of no use to the people.  

Can these two majorities in the Third Duma defeat the revolution?  

The great Russian revolution cannot stop until the peasants receive
land in any appreciable quantity and until the masses of people secure the
main influence on the administration of the state. Can we expect the two
Duma majorities to produce all that? The question is in itself ridiculous:
=

can the feudal-minded landowners and plunderous capitalists be expected to
give land to the peasants and give up the supreme power to the people? No!
They will throw a starving peasant a crust, after stripping him of
everything he has, and they will help only the kulaks and the sharks to
make themselves comfortable, taking all the power for themselves and
leaving the people oppressed and subjugated.  

The Social-Democrats must naturally do everything they can to continue
the people’s great cause—-the revolution, the struggle for liberty and
land.  

In the Duma, the government behind the Octobrists, and the Cadets want
to play a double game. The government,

    

while stepping up its persecutions and putting down Russia with the aid of
bayonet, noose, prison cell and prison camp, pretends to be an advocate of
reform. The Cadets, who have actually embraced the Octobrists, pretend that
they are real champions of liberty. Both want to cheat the people and stamp
out the revolution.  

Let us see that this does not happen! The Social-Democrats, consistent
and loyal fighters for nation-wide emancipation, will unmask the hypocrites
and the cheats. Inside and outside the Duma they will expose the tyrannies
of the Black-Hundred landowners and the government, and the Cadet
tricks. They will—they must—understand that there is now need for more
than a relentless struggle against the government; the Cadets must not be
given either direct or indirect support.  

The Social-Democrats must above all raise their voice to expose most
sternly and relentlessly the foul tsarist crime perpetrated on June 3,
1907. Let the proletariat’s spokesmen in the Duma explain to the people
that the Third Duma cannot serve their interests, that it cannot meet their
demands and that this can be done only by a sovereign constituent assembly
elected through universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot.


The government will propose new laws. The Octobrists, the Cadets and
the Black Hundreds will do the same. All these laws will be a brazen
swindle of the people, a gross violation of their rights and interests, a
mockery of their demands, a mockery of the blood shed by the people in the
struggle for liberty. All these laws will provide protection for the
interests of the landowners and the capitalists. Each of these laws will be
a fresh link in the chains of bondage which the oppressors and the
parasites want to clamp on the workers, the peasants and the urban
poor. Not everyone will understand this right away. But the
Social-Democrats know and understand this, and that is why they will expose
this boldly before the cheated people. In so doing, they must devote
special attention to the laws which relate to the people’s most vital
needs: the laws on land, the laws on labour, on state revenue and
expenditure. In branding the violence and fraud of the feudal-minded land
owners and the capitalists, the Social-Democrats must

    

explain their demands to the entire people: full powers for the people (a
democratic republic), unrestricted liberty and equality, the 8-hour working
day and the easing of working conditions for labour, confiscation of large
estates and the handing of land over to the peasants. They must also point
to the great goal which the proletariat of all countries sets
itself—socialism, complete abolition of wage slavery.  

Alongside the Social-Democrats in the Duma there is a small group of
Left-wingers, mainly the Trudoviks. The Social-Democrats should urge these
men to go along with them. This is especially necessary when there is
occasion to direct questions to the government which is running rampant all
over Russia like a wild beast. Every day, the watch dogs of tsarism—the
police, the gendarmes—and the higher authorities—ministers and
governors—permit themselves gross acts of violence and lawlessness. They
must be ex posed and branded. And it is up to the Social-Democrats to do
this. But a question to the government requires the signatures of 30
members of the Duma, and the Social-Democrats will hardly number more than
18. Together with the other Left-wingers they are 32. The Social-Democrats
must draw up the questions and urge the Left-wingers to join them. If the
Leftists really cherish the great cause of liberty, they must do so. A
heavy blow will then be inflicted on the government, like those the
Social-Democrats inflicted on it with their questions in the Second Duma.


Such are the main tasks of the Social-Democrats in the Third Duma. Our
comrades have some hard work to do. They will be there among enemies,
malicious and ruthless. Efforts will be made to stop their mouths, and they
will be showered with abuse, they will perhaps be expelled from the Duma,
brought to trial, thrown into prison and exiled. They must be firm, in
spite of all persecutions, they must hold high the proletariat’s red banner
and remain loyal to the end to the great cause of struggle for the people’s
emancipation. And all of us, comrades workers, must join forces in
supporting them; we must lend a sensitive ear to their every word, respond
to it, discuss their acts at meetings and rallies, reinforcing by our
sympathies and approval their every correct step, helping them with all our
strength

    

and resources in the struggle for the cause of the revolution. Let the
working class be united in supporting its spokesmen, and in so doing may it
strengthen its unity which it needs in the great struggler—the time when
the “last decisive battle” is fought.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Third Duma held five sessions from November 1 (14), 1907,
to June 9 (22), 1912. Elected on the basis of the June 3 electoral law the
Third Duma was dominated by the Black Hundreds and the Octobrists, and was
a pliant tool of the tsarist government in its counter-revolutionary policy
of violence and repression against the revolutionary forces of Russia.


At the opening of the first session there were 11 parties and groups,
including: Right-wing (extreme Right-wing, nationalist and moderate
Right-wing)—147 deputies; Octobrists—154;
Polish-Lithuanian-Byelorussian group—7; Polish kolo—11; Progressive
group—28; Moslem group—8; Cadets—54; Trudovik group—14; and
Social-Democrats—19.  

The Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma, despite the very
difficult conditions, the small size of the group and some initial
mistakes, did a great deal, thanks to the presence of the Bolshevik
deputies, in exposing the anti-popular policy of the Third Duma, and in the
political education of the proletariat and peasantry of Russia, through
speeches in the Duma and work outside it.

The Electoral Law of December 11 (24), 1906, on the
convocation of a “legislative” Duma was issued by the tsarist government
at the height of the Moscow armed uprising. It assured the landowners and
capitalists of overriding domination in the Duma. The First Duma, elected
under the law, was a Cadet one.

Octobrists—members of the Octobrist Party (or the Union of
October Seventeen) formed in Russia after the issue of the tsar’s manifesto
of October 17 (30), 1905. It was a counter-revolutionary party representing
and fighting for the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landowners
engaged in capitalist operations; it was headed by the well-known Moscow
industrialist and real-estate man A. I. Guchkov and the big landowner
M. V. Rodzyanko. The Octobrists gave full support to the tsarist
government’s domestic and foreign policy.

p. 209





{4}

Union of the Russian People—an ultra-reactionary, diehard
organisation of monarchists, formed in St. Petersburg in October 1905 to
fight the revolutionary movement. It had branches in many towns of Russia.


The Union wanted to preserve the autocracy, semi-feudal landed estates
and privileges for the gentry. “Orthodoxy, Autocracy, National
Character”, the nationalistic slogan of the serf period, was its programme
slogan. Its chief methods of fighting the revolution were pogroms and
assassinations.  

After the dispersal of the Second Duma, the Union broke up into two
organisations: the Chamber of St. Michael the Archangel,

   

led by Purishkevich, which called for the use of the Third Duma for
counter-revolutionary ends, and the Union of the Russian People itself, led
by Dubrovin, which continued the tactics of open terrorism. Both outfits
were liquidated during the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February
1917. After the October Socialist Revolution, former members of these
outfits took an active part in counter-revolutionary revolts and plots
against the Soviet power.

1
 STATEMENT ON THE CONVOCATION OF THE C.C. PLENARY MEETING

Statement: 

In view of the fact that attempts are being made to obscure the initial
point of the incident under discussion, I categorically declare that at the
outset I made a very definite statement of the following: 

According to Grigory’s communication Ezra wrote to him that
t h e  m i n o r  b r o t h e r  d e n i e s  t h e  E x i s t e n
     z r e c h t{1}

  o f  t h e  p l e n a r y  C. C.

It is this communication which has been entirely confirmed by Grigory, and
not clearly refuted by Ezra, that constitutes the
i l l e g a l i t y

of the act by the Mensheviks and the illegality of discussing  s u c
h  questions by the Bund Central Committee. I insist, therefore, on a
search for the text of the letter itself.

A Plenary Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee was held
at Geneva from August 11 to 13 (24 to 26), 1908, and was attended by
12 persons, live Bolsheviks (V. I. Lenin, I. F. Dubrovinsky and
V. K. Taratuta among them), three Mensheviks, one Latvian Social-Democrat,
one Polish Social-Democrat and two Bundists. On the agenda were these
questions: 1) report on the convocation of the Plenary Meeting; 2)
all-Russia conference; 3) Central Bureau Abroad and promotion groups; 4)
organisation of the Central Committee; 5) financial matters; 6) report of
the C.C. to the Stuttgart Congress; and 7) current business.  

At the Plenary Meeting the Bolsheviks administered a resolute rebuff to
the Menshevik efforts to do away with the Party’s Central Committee and to
frustrate the convocation of a Party conference. The Plenary Meeting
adopted decisions on the main items of the agenda as motioned by the
Bolsheviks. On Lenin’s proposal, it was decided to start work right away on
the convocation of a conference, whose agenda was outlined. The Plenary
Meeting adopted Bolshevik resolutions on the organisation of the Central
Commit tee and on the establishment of a Central Bureau Abroad, the latter
being based on Lenin’s “Draft Resolution on the Organisation of the
Central Bureau Abroad” (pp. 217–18). Lenin was elected to the
C.O. Editorial Board from the Bolsheviks.  

The report on the convocation of the Plenary Meeting was discussed
together with the question of organising the Central Committee, for it was
learned during the debate that the Mensheviks had been in correspondence
with the Bund and that they had actually proposed to liquidate the C.C. as
the Party’s governing body under the pretext of “reorganising” it. At the
Plenary Meeting itself, the Mensheviks and the Bundists tried hard to cover
up the fact. It was in this connection that Lenin handed in his special
“Statement on the Convocation of the C.C. Plenary Meeting” and motioned
the “Draft Resolution on the Incident over the Convocation of the
C.C. Plenary Meeting” which the Plenary Meeting adopted (pp. 216, 217).


After the Plenary Meeting, the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, started a
broad campaign in preparation for an all-Russia Party conference.

The R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee Bureau Abroad
(C.C.B.A.) was set up by the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee Plenary
Meeting in August 1908 as a three-man body representing the Party abroad
under the Central Committee’s Bureau in Russia. Its duty was to maintain
contacts with the Central Committee in Russia

   

and its members working abroad, supervise the activity of
R.S.D.L.P. promotion groups abroad and their Central Bureau, collect dues
or the C.C. fund from organisations abroad and organise the collection of
money for the Central Committee. In order to unite all the promotion groups
abroad and to subordinate them to a single general Party leadership the
August 1908 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee authorised the
C.C.B.A. to hold a special congress of these groups, which it failed to do
in 1900 because of stubborn resistance from the Central Bureau of the
promotion groups abroad, where the Menshevik liquidators were in
control. The January 1910 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee
reorganised the C.C.B.A. and limited its role in directing the Party’s
general affairs, correspondingly increasing that of the Central Committee
Bureau in Russia. The C.C.B.A. was to have five members, three of them
representing the Central Committees of hon-Russian national
organisations. A stable liquidationist majority war formed in the Central
Committee Bureau Abroad and it did everything to disrupt the work of the
central Party bodies, Its anti-Party stand was most clearly revealed in the
systematic obstruction to the calling of a C.C. Plenary Meeting, which the
Bolsheviks were trying to secure in view of the liquidators’ failure to
fulfill the decisions of the C.C.’s January Plenary Meeting. The C.C.B.A.’s
liquidationist tactics made the Bolshevik representative Semashko resign
from the C.C.B.A. in May 1911.  

The meeting of R.S.D.L.P. C.C. members called in Paris in June 1911
adopted a decision condemning the C.C.B.A.’s political line and referred
the question of its continued existence to the next Plenary Meeting of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.  

In November 1911, the Polish Social-Democratic representative was
recalled from the C.C.B.A., and he was followed by the Latvian
Social-Democrat. The C.C.B.A. dissolved itself in January 1912.

 EXPLANATION TO SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF ORGANISATION{4} 
 Statement of Fact 

I declare that in my speech on the organisational question,
which alone was discussed today, I did n a t say nor did I intend
to say a single word either about the attitude of the Caucasians

Sotsial-Demokrata{5} or about “Golos Sotsial-Demokrata” in
general. That is why by starting his speech with a statement that on
this question there were now no differences between the Caucasians
and Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, Comrade Pyotr of Tiflis had no reason
at all to mention my name. As for the earlier debates, I merely spoke of
the differences between some members of the Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board and the Caucasians, which were
revealed at the August Plenary Meeting of the C.C. in 1908.

STATEMENT CONCERNING THE MENSHEVIK DRAFT
ON LIQUIDATING THE C.C. {7} 

Statement of Fact 

The letter of Comrades Martynov and Igorev, which they had promised to place
before the C.C. but heve failed to do over a period of four months, did not deal
with the way the C.C. was to function but with its “right to exist”
(Existenzrecht), i.e., it dealt specifiqaily with the liquidationist plans.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Fifth All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in
Paris from December 21 to 27, 1908 (January 3 to 9, 1909). It was attended
by 16 delegates with vote, among them five Bolsheviks, three Mensheviks,
five Polish Social-Democrats and three Bundists. On the agenda were the
following questions: 1) Reports of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, the
Central Committee of the Polish Social-Democrats, the Bund Central
Committee, the St. Petersburg organisation, the Moscow, Central Industrial
Region, Urals and Caucasian organisations. 2) The present political
situation and the Party’s tasks. 3) The Social-Democratic Duma group. 4)
Organisational questions in connection with the changed political
conditions. 5) Local mergers with non-Russian organisations. 6) Affairs
abroad. On every question, the Bolsheviks conducted a relentless struggle
against the Menshevik liquidators and their supporters. The Conference
resolution “On the Reports” sharply condemned liquidationism as an
opportunist trend and called for the most resolute ideological and
organisational struggle against any attempts to liquidate the Party.  

The work of the Conference was centred on Lenin’s report “On the
Present Moment and the Tasks of the Party”. The Mensheviks

   

tried in vain to get the item off the agenda. The Conference adopted the
resolution motioned by Lenin with slight amendments

(see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 321–24).



The resolution “On the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma”, motioned
by the Bolsheviks, criticised the activity of the group and stated its
concrete tasks. The Mensheviks objected to any indication of the Duma
group’s mistakes in the Conference decisions and opposed the Central
Committee’s right of veto in respect of the group. The otzovists also came
out against the Leninist line in respect of the Duma group. The Conference
adopted the Bolshevik resolution, whose text included a part of Lenin’s
second variant of “Practical Instructions on Voting for the Budget by the
Social-Democratic Group in the Duma” and all of his “Addendum to the
Resolution on ‘The Social-Democratic Group in the Duma’\thinspace”

(see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 326–27, 328).

During the discussion of the organisational question, the Bolshevik
proposed a draft resolution stating that the Party should devote special
attention to the establishment and strengthening of illegal Party
organisations, making use of an extensive network of diverse legal
societies for work among the masses. The Mensheviks were actually trying to
liquidate the illegal Party and stop all revolutionary work. In his speech
on the organisational question, Lenin sharply criticised the resolution of
the Menshevik liquidators and their attempts to justify those who had
deserted from the Party in the years of reaction. The Conference adopted
Lenin’s “Directives for the Committee on Questions of Organisation”

(see present edition, Vol. 15, p. 325)

and set up a committee to draft a resolution. The committee, and then the
Conference itself, adopted the Bolshevik draft resolution. The Conference’s
resolution on the local merger of national organisations resolutely
rejected the principle of federalism, which the Bundists supported, as they
wanted workers in the Party to be compartmentalised on national
lines. During the discussion of the Central Committee’s work, the
Mensheviks proposed that its seat should be transferred to Russia and that
the C.C. Bureau Abroad should be eliminated. The liquidationist draft
resolutions were rejected. The Conference adopted a resolution recognising
“the existence abroad of a general Party representative body in the form
of the Central Committee Bureau A road as being useful and necessary”. A
Bolshevik resolution was adopted on the Central Organ; the Conference
rejected the Menshevik proposal to have the publication of the
C.O. transferred to Russia.  

The Bolsheviks won a great victory at the Conference in their struggle
against the Menshevik liquidators. The Conference decisions also dealt a
blow at the otzovists. In the years of reaction, the Party was guided by
the decisions of this Conference. Lenin said that the Fifth All-Russia
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. “has led the Party out on to the road, and
evidently marks a turning-point in the development of the Russian
working-class movement after the victory of the counter-revolution”

(see present edition, Vol. 15, p. 345).

p. 218





{2}

On the strength of the short record of Lenin’s speech, it is impossible
to say how fully his speech on the organisational question on December 24,
1908 (January 6, 1909) reflected all the questions listed in the outline,
but these suggest that it may have been written during the debate on the
organisational question.

p. 218





{3}

A reference to the Party’s twelve-man Central Committee elected at the
Fifth (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., the five meaning its narrow
group working in Russia. Lenin’s ironical quip about the “angelic order”
of the five seems to refer to the draft resolution of the Menshevik
liquidators proposing to eliminate the C.C. Bureau Abroad and concentrate
all Party guidance in the hands of the five in Russia.

p. 218





{4}

Lenin made the statement at the Conference on December 24, 1908
(January 6, 1939), after the slanderous statement by a member of the
Caucasian delegation, the Menshevik N. Ramishvili (Pyotr). It became known
at the Central Committee Plenary Meeting in August 1908 that the Menshevik
liquidators had tried, even before the Plenary Meeting, to have the
C.C. eliminated as the governing body of the Party and its activity
confined to the functions of information. The plan to eliminate the
C.C. was set out in a letter addressed in June 1908 by B. Gorev, a member
of the C.C., and A. Martynov, a member of the Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board, “To All Menshevik
Organisations”. At the Plenary Meeting itself the Mensheviks tried hard to
cover up their intention to liquidate the C.C. (pp. 216–17). The
Bolsheviks exposed the disorganising, anti-Party activity of the
liquidators. The C.C. Plenary Meeting adopted Bolshevik draft resolutions
on all the main items of the agenda. At the Fifth All-Russia Conference
members of the Golos Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board Dan and
Axelrod and C.C. member N. Ramishvili, who had credentials from the
Caucasian organisation, took a common, extreme liquidationist stand.

p. 219





{5}

Golos Sotsial-Demokrata (The Voice of the
Social-Democrat)—the Menshevik organ abroad, first published in Geneva
and then in Paris from February 1908 to December 1911. Its editors were
P. B. Axelrod, F. I. Dan, L. Martov, A. Martynov and G. V. Plekhanov. From
its first issue, the paper stood up for the liquidators, justifying their
anti-Party activity. Following Plekhanov’s withdrawal from the Editorial
Board over the paper’s liquidationist stand, it crystallised as the
ideological centre of liquidationism.

p. 219





{6}

Lenin entered his statement of fact at the last, ninth, sitting of the
Conference on December 26, 1908 (January 8, 1909). The minutes show that
the sitting continued its discussion of the resolution on the
Social-Democratic Duma group. During the discussion of the point on budget
voting, Lenin motioned his wording of this part of the resolution

(see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 326–27).

In the minutes there is an amendment by M. N. Lyadov proposing that the end
of the resolution “and trade union organisations”

   

should be worded as “after exchange of opinion with representatives of the
trade unions”. Lyadov said this was necessary because the draft resolution
under discussion tended to narrow down the Central Committee’s
powers. Lenin opposed Lyadov’s amendment, saying that the C.C. had the
right of veto in respect of the Social-Democratic Duma group. Lyadov’s
amendment was rejected. The decision on the C.C.’s right of veto in respect
of the Duma group was adopted at tie same sitting. It said that in view of
its responsibility for the work of the group the C.C. must use its right of
veto unhesitatingly “where the group’s decisions threaten to harm the
Party”.

p. 220





{7}

Lenin motioned the statement at the Conference on December 26, 1908
(January 8, 1909) during the discussion of the resolution on the Central
Committee’s work. The Menshevik liquidators had tried to liquidate the
Central Committee’s the Party’s governing body even before the Central
Committee’s Plenary Meeting in August 1908. Accordingly, Lenin motioned his
“Statement on the Convocation of the C.C. Plenary Meeting” at the Plenary
Meeting on August 12 (25), 1908 (p. 216). The resolution “On the Incident
over the Convocation of the C.C. Plenary Meeting” was adopted the
following day on Lenin’s motion (p. 217).

Notes
 
 



{1}

The plan was written in 1938 or 1909, but the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism has no direct information on these lectures. Those who
were there recall that Lenin read some lectures on philosophy in the
Bolshevik circle in Paris in early 1909. Mention of industry in 1907 is an
indication that the plan was written later than 1907, since the statistical
data for that year could not have been available before the beginning of
the following one.  

The reference to “present-day opportunists (Bogdanov)” in point 6 of
the section “Philosophical Materialism” implies that the plan was written
not earlier than the second half of March 1908, just when (not later than
April 3 [16]) Lenin had sent to the press his article “Marxism and
Revisionism”, in which he made is first press attack on Bogdanov for his
opportunist, revisionist views in philosophy. Almost all the points of the
section “Philosophical Materialism” are reflected in his book
“Materialism and Empirio-Criticism”; some points of the section
“The Agrarian Question” are dealt with in his works on the agrarian
question written in 1908.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE RESOLUTION ON AGITATION FOR A BOLSHEVIK
CONGRESS OR A BOLSHEVIK CONFERENCE SEPARATE  THE PARTY 
 JUNE 8 (21) 
1

It is said, on the one hand, that there are no differences
of principle, and there is a refusal to make open statements, and on the
other, there is talk of basic differences in the Bolshevik faction. Isn’t
that duplicity? At the general Party conference Dan said: Doesn’t everyone
know that Lenin is being accused of Menshevism? I replied: Read
Proletary and judge on that basis, instead of collecting
gossip. At the time, Maximov was silent. Nothing is worse than the absence
of open struggle. I say: Our unity based on principle has been disrupted,
you say something else, and yet you call Lenin Martov.... Why is the
present meeting illegal in Party terms? Members of the Bolshevik Centre
elected at the Congress are talking about how best to conduct Bolshevik
views. What is so inadmissible about that? In agitating for a special
Bolshevik congress you show that you have lost all faith in the Party
principle. We have

    

always stood for the Party principle, ever since the Second Congress, and
are now continuing the same line, while you are preaching a split at the
grass roots. There is also a pro-Party trend among the Mensheviks. We
believe in the Party principle and stand up for it.

Maximov says that there has been no agitation for a
congress. Lyadov, Stanislav, and Vsevolod have spoken out with sufficient
clarity. Since May 1908, Lyadov and Stanislav have been agitating in
Russia. We have Stanislav’s resolution, which says clearly enough what he
wants.{2} This is a mockery of our faction. The Mensheviks have an
orthodox-Marxist, Plekhanovite, trend and the Bolsheviks also have an
orthodox-Marxist trend. Both the Mensheviks and we have the
Valentinov-Maximov liquidationist trend, etc. Concerning Comrade Maximov’s
statement, I repeat that what I said was in reply to Maximov’s
words: “a fully Leninist-Plekhanovite faction is crystallising”.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF OTZOVISM AND ULTIMATUMISM{3}

 JUNE 9 (22) 

I want to deal with the “idea of the centre”. Maximov has
mixed things up over the Kotka
conference{4}; this is how it was: if the Poles were in favour of a
boycott and my vote were decisive, I declared that in that case I preferred
to vote with the Bolsheviks. That was the condition I put in respect of the
Poles. At that time, the whole Bolshevik Centre was against the
boycott. The faction, how ever, was for the boycott, but there was no
split, because

    

there was no group which wanted one. A year later, the faction turned out
to be on our side. There are some “Bolsheviks” who are afraid of hitting
out at the otzovists and of siding with the Mensheviks. At the conference I
joined with the Mensheviks against the otzovists. That is what you think
about the centre.  

The story of the split as related by Maximov is a curious
one. Maximov’s papers say nothing about the centre but Mikha’s letter has
now been authenticated. The letter said that Lenin was conducting a
Right-wing Bundist line. That is in the documents. Mikha wrote what Maximov
is now saying. There is your idea of the centre. We got this letter from
our Caucasian friends, who handed their mandate over to the Rightist
Ilyich. Mikha conducted this policy in July 1908 with the participation of
the group. Maximov says that we shall confer with Plekhanov. Of course, we
shall, as we shall with Dan, and Martov in the
C.O.{5} It took a fierce struggle at the conference to get the
otzovists to be loyal. We confronted them with ultimatums. When Axelrod
read the point about military-combat tasks, he said:
“It is not hard to work with such ‘Bolsheviks’.” We shall not let the
otzovists into the Duma commissions, Where we were with Dan. Indeed! We
shall confer with Plekhanov, as we shall with Dan and Martov. You can say
as much in the press.  

In the C.C. I confer with Marat. You, Marat, are a member of the
faction of divine otzovists. I am not talking about good intentions but
about the political line. I ask you, comrades, to give thought to what is
being said about Plekhanov. When Plekhanov speaks of his mistake in respect
of the trade unions, we are reproached for failing to repulse him. When he
is prepared to sacrifice his mistake, the question is whether we are
attracting him by the article against Lunacharsky or whether you are
repulsing the minority of the pro-Party
Mensheviks{6} and the orthodox-Marxist Mensheviks for the sake of
Bogdanov-Lunacharsky anti-Marxist propaganda. We have not made a deal with
Plekhanov against Lunacharsky, but we can tell you who is flirting with
whom. When Plekhanov kicks out Potresov, I am prepared to give him my
hand. This is not a new centre, but a new caricatured Bolshevism. We are
having

    

a replay of the old Rosa Luxemburg
story.{7} But the replay here is caricatured, and “Bolshevism” must
be safeguarded from it.  

“Bolshevism” must now become strictly Marxist.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE PARTY SCHOOL ON
CAPRI{8} 
 JUNE 10 (23) 

I am surprised that we are not yet bored with all
this. Comrade Maximov has no reason to be excited, because there has never
been a single split without extreme accusations, and split incidents have
always been confused with matters of honour. I remember the scenes with
Krichevsky in 1901, with Martov in 1905, and with Plekhanov in 1907—and
all of them attacked me with cries about honour. It is not a question of
honour, but of the fact that in the process of struggle men tend to
disorganise their faction and organise a new one. Take Lyadov as an
example. He has not become a bad comrade, but he is disorganising our
faction and trying to set up a new one. I think that Maximov is
disorganising those whom he believes to be Mensheviks. He has a perfect
right to do that, but he keeps telling us about Lenin’s being invited to
the school. The question of control is a ridiculous one too. We can’t have
that. It is clear that the school is a new centre, a new trend. Marat says
that he will not abandon his posts. You, Comrade Marat, have succumbed to
the factional fervour which is determined by the political struggle of the
“divine” Otzovists.  

What is a faction? It is an alliance of like-minded persons within a
party. In the Duma, the party is an alliance of like-minded men inside the
Duma. After all, when a member of the Duma, like Khomyakov, goes over to
another party he does not cease to be its chairman. The same applies

    

to a faction in the party. The party alone can relieve you of the post
which you have taken up on behalf of the party. We are now quarrelling—it
is because we have no alliance of like-minded men. No one is encroaching on
your Party post and there is no point in bringing it in. We do not have a
split in the Party, but in the faction. The writ of our conference does not
run to Party posts. And honour has nothing to do with all this. For my
part, I am used to that sort of thing: this is the fourth time I am being
abused. We must recognise what there is: two centres, two trends and the
school as a fact. And when we group out, everything will be much clearer.

 SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE FACTION’S UNITY 
 JUNE 12 (25) 

I am not going to reply to Maximov; everyone is arriving at
the conclusion that this is our last joint sitting with him. We should,
therefore refrain from exchanging abuse at the last moment. That is
undignified. Marat says that he is being invited to kick himself out. When
Marat declared that he preferred to work with the anti-otzovists rather
than with the otzovists, his declaration was met with cries of “Bravo!”
No one accused him of setting up the break-away centre at Capri, his
statement on god-building was quite definite. He is wrong in formal
terms. For our part we did not take the division beyond the point where the
separate centres of like-minded partisans had already taken shape.

 FIRST SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF BOLSHEVIK TASKS RELATING
TO DUMA ACTIVITY 
 JUNE 12 (25) 

Vishnevsky’s report is the first positive contribution we
have heard here.  

As for the failure to send a delegate to the general Party conference,
Vishnevsky seems to be making a mistake. Poletayev said that the deputies
would arrive if Dan sent a telegram. Dan refused to do so. The conference
has suffered greatly because of the absence of the
delegate.{9} 

You say that the well-informed
persons{10} should not be expelled. The way to fight them is through
publicity. More information should be given about them. They should be
grouped and characterised.  

The question of the Proletary Editorial Board’s secretary
attached to the Duma group. The secretary was not equal to his task and
wrote in a highly formal manner; Steklov is not the man for this job; there
is need for a man to do the spade-work. The information should be as
circumstantial as possible, otherwise all the promotion groups will be
quite useless.  

The Paris promotion group{11} is a delicate matter. We shall support
Plekhanov’s line; the other Mensheviks take a very nervous attitude to
this. A rapprochement with the Mensheviks of the Dan type is hard. How is a
group to be formed? The Mensheviks will get a crowd in. Nothing except a
fight can be the result. Perhaps, in order to avoid a squabble the group
should be set up under the C.O.  

Nothing can be done in the Duma group without well-informed persons
from the Bolsheviks. For this we should legalise two or three men. One
suggestion is Vadim, and perhaps Kamenev.  

Concerning the participation of local organisations in the activity of
the Duma group. Broad leaflet agitation should be started. Definite
specimen leaflets about Duma activity should be issued. The revolutionary
Social-Democratic use of the Duma will be neither revolutionary nor
Social-Democratic without the influence of the organisations.

    

There is need of leaflets on the subjects of the Duma
speeches. This kind of thing will involve the organisations in the
work and give them an impetus. Up to now, insufficient use has been made of
deputies’ meetings. They wasted most of their time on debates with the
otzovists. There is also need for leaflets on the party grouping in the
Duma and, finally, leaflets on the work of the Duma in
general. It is not only the C.C. representatives, but also the
organisations that should direct the Duma group. We must have leaflets
on the meaning of this or that speech in the Duma. Take the question
of foreign policy. Our deputies were the only ones to speak. This was not
properly assessed. There is need for leaflets with extracts from
speeches. I see no other way for the organisations’ participation
except in the form of leaflets. The disorganisation is desperate, the
leaflet activity should be pressed forward vigorously. Criticism in foreign
newspapers is late. Parliamentary speeches will always say less than
everything. The i’s will be dotted by the leaflets.  

It is sometimes very hard for the organisations to send their
representatives.  

As for the newspaper, there is only one condition: a majority secured
for us, but I do not believe it is possible to realise such a
paper.{12}

ADDENDUM TO THE RESOLUTION “ON THE ATTITUDE TO DUMA ACTIVITY AMONG THE
OTHER BRANCHES OF PARTY
WORK”{13} 

Considerably more attention, initiative and effort should
be devoted to the use of legal possibilities (a sphere in which some
successes have already been scored) than has been done until now.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE PARTY PRESS

It is, of course, impossible to destroy
Proletary. There is need for a popular organ, but the question
depends on various other combinations, for instance, finance. It is not
right to prohibit assistance for the legal press in such resolute terms as
Vlasov has done. I think it would be useful to publish a small magazine,
about the size of, say,
Dal,{14} which the Menshevik liquidators are publishing.

SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF PUBLISHING PHILOSOPHICAL ARTICLES
IN THE CENTRAL ORGAN 
 JUNE 15 (28) 

Since we cannot foresee how the debate on philosophy will
develop, the question should not be posed as Comrade Marat has
done. Therefore all restrictions on the C.O. in this respect should be
lifted. I welcome Comrade Marat’s statement on the need of philosophical
articles in the legal miscellanies.

PROPOSAL ON THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR A NEWSPAPER OF THE DUMA
GROUP{15} 
 JUNE 16 (29) 

In view of the importance of Comrade Meshkovsky’s
statement, I propose that of the 1,500 rubles earmarked for legal
publishing, 1,000 should be used for the Duma newspaper.

SPEECHES AND PROPOSALS IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF REORGANISING THE
BOLSHEVIK CENTRE 
 JUNE 17 (30) 
1

I agree with Meshkovsky. A referendum concerns all Party members, and
that is impossible to put through. Conferences are desirable, but they
should not be made statutory. I believe that the idea of periodical
conferences should alone be adopted.  
2

It should be written that the Russian members of the Bolshevik Centre
constitute a collegium in general, without limiting their number to three.

3

In the absence of a Plenary Meeting, the Executive Commission may
replace the Proletary editors and members of the Economic
Commission in the event of their leaving.  

The Bolshevik Centre Secretariat Abroad, consisting of two persons,
shall be appointed by a Plenary Meeting.

{1}

The Conference was called on Lenin’s initiative, and was held in Paris
from June 8 to 17 (21 to 30), 1909. It was attended by nine members of the
Bolshevik Centre, the supreme body of the Bolshevik group, elected by the
Bolshevik delegates at the Fifth (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.;
representatives of the St. Petersburg, Moscow Region and Urals
organisations were also there. It was held under Lenin’s guidance, and his
speeches on all the main items of the agenda determined the character of
its work. The otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders ware represented by
A. Bogdanov (Maximov) and

   

V. L. Shantser (Marat), who were supported by V. M. Shulyatikov (Donat),
representing the Moscow Region organisation. On several questions
G. Y. Zinoviev, L. B. Kamenev, A. I. Rykov and M. P. Tomsky took a
conciliatory stand.  

The Conference discussed the following questions: otzovism and
ultimatumism; god-building tendencies among Social-Democrats; attitude to
the activity in the Duma among the other branches of Party work; the tasks
of the Bolsheviks in the Party; the Party school being set up on Capri;
unity of the group; the agitation for a Bolshevik Congress or a Bolshevik
conference separate from the Party; the split-away of A. Bogdanov, and
other questions. Lenin gave detailed information on the state of affairs in
the Party and the Bolshevik group. His propositions became the basis of
decisions adopted by the Conference.  

The Conference resolutely condemned otzovism-ultimatumism as a harmful
and dangerous trend within the working-class movement; it sharply
criticised the philosophical views of the otzovists-ultimatumists, which
were especially strikingly revealed in the idea of god-building. Bogdanov,
the leader and ideologist of the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders,
who had made an attempt on the unity of the Bolshevik group and had taken
the way of revising Marxism and substituting for it an idealist,
reactionary philosophy, was expelled from the Bolshevik group.  

The Conference decisions were of great importance for the whole
Party. Lenin said that they gave great harmony arid completeness to the
political line which had been worked out by the Party in the years of
reaction.

For details about the Conference see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 425–51.

The resolution motioned by Stanislav (“Yer”,
S. Volsky—A. V. Sokolov) in the Moscow Committee expressed no confidence
in the Editorial Board of Proletary and called for a Bolshevik
conference to elect a new ideological centre. The Moscow Committee rejected
the resolution “by every vote except his own”

(see present edition, Vol. 16, p. 53). The text of the resolution has not
been discovered.

p. 223





{3}

Otzovists—representatives of an opportunist trend among the
Bolsheviks. Behind a screen of revolutionary talk, the otzovists
(A. Bogdanov, G. A. Alexinsky, A. V. Sokolov [S. Volsky],
A. V. Lunacharsky, M. N. Lyadov and others) demanded the recall of the
Social-Democratic deputies from the Third Duma and an end to work in legal
organisations. They held that in the conditions of reaction the Party
should conduct illegal activity only, and refused to participate in the
Duma, in the workers’ trade unions, co-operatives and other mass legal and
semi-legal organisations. Ultimatumism was a variety of otzovism. The
ultimatumists differed from the otzovists only in form. They proposed
presenting the Social-Democratic Duma group with an ultimatum that it
should implicitly submit to the Party Central Committee’s decisions and
should be recalled from the Duma in the event of
noncompliance. Ultimatumism was in fact a camouflaged

   

otzovism, and Lenin said the ultimatumists were “bashful otzovists”.


The otzovists were doing the Party a great deal of harm. Their policy
could lead to the Party’s separation from the masses and its transformation
into a sectarian organisation incapable of mustering forces for another
revolutionary upsurge. Lenin exposed the otzovists as “liquidators inside
out”, and declared a relentless light against them. He wrote: “Otzovism
is not Bolshevism but the worst political travesty of Bolshevism
its worst political enemy could invent”

(see present edition, Vol. 15, p. 357).

The Third (Second All-Russia) Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. was held at Kotka, Finland, from July 21 to 23 (August 3 to
5), 1907. It was attended by 26 delegates, nine of them Bolsheviks, five
Mensheviks, five Polish Social-Democrats, five Bundists and two Latvian
Social-Democrats. Among the delegates were V. I. Lenin, F. E. Dzerzhinsky,
A. V. Lunacharsky and Rosa Luxemburg. The Conference was also attended by
members and alternate members of the Party Central Committee elected at the
Fifth (London) Congress. The need to call an urgent conference (two months
after the Fifth Congress) was due to the changed political situation in
view of the Third of June counter-revolutionary coup and the elections to
the Third Duma. On the agenda of the Conference were the following
questions: participation in the elections to the Third Duma, electoral
agreements with other parties, electoral platform and the All-Russia
Congress of Trade Unions.  

On the first question, the Conference heard three reports: =

Lenin’s (against a boycott) and A. Bogdanov’s (for a boycott) from the
Bolsheviks, and F. Dan’s, from the Mensheviks and the Bund. The Conference
adopted as a basis Lenin’s draft resolution calling on the Party to take
part in the electoral campaign and to struggle both against the Rightist
parties and against the Cadets (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh...,
Part I, pp. 173–74). When their resolution was rejected, the Bolsheviks
favouring a boycott voted for Lenin’s resolution.  

The Conference decided that at the first stage of the elections, the
Social-Democrats should not enter into any agreements with other parties,
agreements being allowed on second and subsequent ballots with all parties
left of the Cadets. At the second and subsequent stages of the elections,
agreements could be reached with all revolutionary and opposition parties
to fight the Rightists. But in the workers’ curia, the Social-Democrats
were not to enter into agreements with other parties, with the exception of
national Social-Democratic parties outside the R.S.D.L.P., and also the
P.P.S. The Conference invited the Central Committee to draw up the
electoral platform on the basis of its resolution on participation in the
elections to the Third Duma. The Conference heard two reports on the
All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions: one for the principle of the
partisanship of the trade unions, and another, for the trade unions
remaining neutral. There were four draft resolutions on the reports (a
Bolshevik, a Menshevik, and two compromise resolutions). The Conference
decided to refer them

   

to the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee. The Bolshevik draft resolution was
based on the draft proposed by Lenin (see K.P.S.S. v
rezolutsiyakh..., Part I, p. 180).  

The importance of the Third Conference lies in the fact that it marked
out the principles of the Party’s tactics in the new historical
situation—the period of the Stolypin reaction.

p. 223





{5}

Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. (C.O.)—the illegal newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat published from February 1908 to January 1917. The
first issue prepared by the Bolsheviks and partly printed by a private
printer at Vilno was confiscated by the tsarist secret police. Soon another
attempt was made to publish the newspaper in St. Petersburg. The bulk of
the printing likewise fell into the hands of the gendarmes. Subsequently,
the paper was published abroad: Nos. 2–32 (February 1909–December 1913)
in Paris; Nos. 33–58 (November 1914–January 1917) in Geneva. There were
altogether 58 issues, of which five had supplements. Lenin was the actual
editor of the paper, and his articles were the centre-pieces of the
newspaper. More than 80 articles and items by Lenin appeared in
Sotsial-Demokrat.

p. 224





{6}

The pro-Party Mensheviks, headed by G. V. Plekhanov, opposed
the liquidators in the years of reaction. While retaining their Menshevik
positions, the Plekhanovites wanted the illegal Party organisation
preserved and strengthened, and on that point favoured a bloc with the
Bolsheviks. Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to move nearer to the pro-Party
Mensheviks, saying that there could be an agreement with them on the basis
of a struggle for the Party, and against the liquidators, “...without any
ideological compromises, without any glossing over of tactical and other
differences of opinion within the limits of the Party line”

(see present edition, Vol. 16, p. 101).

The pro-Party Mensheviks joined the Bolsheviks in working in the local
Party committees, and contributed to Bolshevik publications. At the end of
1911, Plekhanov broke up the bloc with the Bolsheviks. On the pretext of
fighting the “factionalism” and the split within the R.S.D.L.P., he tried
to reconcile the Bolsheviks and the opportunists. In 1912, the
Plekhanovites joined the Trotskyites, Bundists and liquidators in opposing
the decisions of the Prague Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.

p. 224





{7}

A reference to A. Bogdanov’s speech in the debate on the report on
otzovism and ultimatumism, which said that Rosa Luxemburg had sharply
condemned both. In an effort to cast doubt on her criticism, Bogdanov
recalled that in 1904 and 1905 Rosa Luxemburg had opposed the Bolsheviks.

p. 225





{8}

The school was set up in 1909 on the isle of Capri, Italy, by the
otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders. The conference of the enlarged
Editorial Board of Proletary exposed the factional anti-Bolshevik
character of the school, stating that its organisers were pursuing “not
aims common to the Bolshevik wing as a whole, as an ideological trend in
the Party, but the private aims of a group with a separate ideology and
policy”. The school was resolutely

   

condemned as a “new centre being formed for a faction breaking away from
the Bolsheviks”

(see present edition, Vol. 15, p. 450).



It was opened in August. Lectures were given by A. Bogdanov,
G. Alexinsky, A. Lunacharsky, Maxim Gorky, M. N. Lyadov, M. N. Pokrovsky
and V. A. Desnitsky. Lenin rejected a formal invitation to go and lecture
at the school. In a letter to its students, who were insisting that he read
them a series of lectures, Lenin said that he could not do so because the
school had been “deliberately hidden away from the Party” in a
“remote foreign spot” and was of a factional character. He invited the
students to come to Paris “to study Social-Democracy”, instead of the
“separatist factional ‘science’\thinspace” of the
otzovists and god-builders

(see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 472–78).



For a detailed history of the school and its characteristic, see
Lenin’s articles “The Faction of Supporters of Otzovism and God-Building”
and “A Shameful Fiasco”

(present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 29–61, 85–86).

p. 225





{9}

A reference to the failure to attend the Fifth Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. (All-Russia Conference of 1908) by the representative of the
Duma Social-Democratic group. The rapporteur Vishnevsky (I. P. Goldenberg)
said it was accidental.

p. 227





{10}

A group of intellectuals acting as advisers to the Social-Democratic
group in the Third Duma, most of them liquidators and
revisionists—A. N. Potresov, S. N. Prokopovich, etc. Making use of the
fact that the leaders of the Bolshevik Party were in hiding and unable to
Work legally with the Duma group, these persons tried to direct the group’s
activity along anti-art lines, and this gave rise to the question of doing
without their services.

p. 227





{11}

A reference to the establishment of a promotion committee for the
Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma. The Conference decided to set up
a promotion committee, and Lenin, who was elected to the committee, was
very active on it. In particular, he wrote his “Explanatory Note on the
Draft of the Main Grounds of the Bill on the Eight-Hour Working Day”

(see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 110–16).

p. 227





{12}

A reference to the paper which was to be published by the
R.S.D.L.P. group in the Duma. Subsequently, from 1910 to 1912, the legal
Bolshevik newspaper Zvezda (The Star) was published with the
participation of the Duma group.

p. 228





{13}

This addendum was incorporated in point three of the first section of
the resolution (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh..., Part I, p. 223).

p. 228





{14}

Dal (Horizon)—a literary and socio-political magazine
published by the liquidators in St. Petersburg. Three issues were put out:
=

the first in 1908, the second and third in 1909.

Lenin’s proposal was incorporated in the resolution “On Legal
Publishing” (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh..., Part I, p. 232).

Notes
 
 



{1}

The First World Socialist Congress of the Second International
was held in Paris in July 1889. Ideological guidance was provided by
Frederick Engels. There was acute political struggle

between

the Marxists and the anarchists, who repudiated political struggle. The
Congress decided on the need to strengthen the mass working-class movement
and set up socialist parties for political struggle and the winning of
power by the proletariat. The Congress said that the ultimate aim of the
labour movement was socialism and, despite anarchist protests, resolved to
struggle for an eight hour working day, higher wages, abolition of payments
in kind, etc. It also adopted the historic decision of celebrating May Day
by staging demonstrations as a mark of proletarian solidarity.

p. 231





{2}

The International Socialist Congress In Copenhagen (Eighth
Congress of the Second International) was held from August 28 to
September 3, 1910. It was attended by 896 delegates representing countries
in Europe, North and South America, South Africa and Australia. Russia,
like Austria, Britain, France and Germany, had 20 votes, of which the
Social-Democrats (including the Lithuanian and Armenian Social-Democrats)
had 10; the S.R.s—7; the trade unions—3. Among those who represented
the R.S.D.L.P. were V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov, A. M. Kollontai and
A. V. Lunacharsky.  

Five committees were set up for preliminary discussion and drafting of
resolutions on various questions: co-operatives, trade unions,
international solidarity, and unity of the trade union movement in Austria;
the struggle against war; labour legislation and unemployment;
miscellaneous, including socialist unity, capital punishment, Finland,
Argentina, Persia, etc.  

Lenin was on the co-operative committee, one of the most important
ones.  

The resolution on the struggle against war—“Arbitration Courts and
Disarmament”—confirmed the resolution of the Stuttgart Congress of 1907
on “Militarism and International Conflicts”, which included the
amendments motioned by Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, calling on the socialists
of all countries to make use of the economic and political crisis caused by
war to overthrow the bourgeoisie. The resolution of the Copenhagen Congress
also bound the socialist parties and their representatives in parliaments
to demand that their governments reduce armaments, and settle conflicts
between states through arbitration courts, and urged the workers of all
countries to stage protests against the threat of war.  

Lenin held a conference of Left-wing Social-Democrats attending the
Congress to rally the revolutionary Marxists in the inter national arena.

1
 REPORT ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE PARTY{3} 

Following the C.C. Plenary Meeting in January
1910{4} the Bolsheviks bent every effort to restore the composition of
the C.C. and help it to resume its activity. C.C. members Makar and
Innokenty contacted local Party organisations and Party members working in
the open labour movement, together with them nominated candidates for
co-optation to the C.C., etc. But the efforts of the C.C. Bolsheviks ended
in the arrest of both. They got no help at all from the Golos
people in their work in Russia. The representatives of the Mensheviks,
elected at the London Congress, Mikhail, Yuri and Roman, who have now gone
over to the independent legalists, have not only refused to work in the
C.C., but have announced that they consider its very existence harmful to
the labour movement.  

In 1910, following a break of several months, Comrade Makar, who
escaped from exile, and Comrade Vyazemsky once again set up a bureau for
convening the
 C.C.[1]

The Bundist Yudin, a member of the Bureau, took part in their work. Over a
period of six months, they once again established contacts with local
organisations, nominated candidates for the C.C., dispatched agents, and
joined the Duma group in organising the election campaign for the
by-elections in Moscow.  

Of the representatives of the Mensheviks, they succeeded in contacting
only Comrade Kostrov, who once or twice came merely to exercise his right
to vote in the event it came to a convocation of the C.C.  

After working for six months, the C.C. Bolsheviks were arrested
together with several candidates for co-optation to the C.C., the comrade
secretary and a number of other

    

persons variously connected with the Bureau’s activity. In a letter sent
from prison after their arrest, the comrades C.C. members stated that the
gendarmes had kept them under constant surveillance for a number of months
and had been informed of their every step, and that there was no doubt at
all about the provocation over the preparations for convening the C.C. in
Russia; Following the arrest of two members of the Bureau (Makar and
Vyazemsky), the C.C. members still at large—Yudin and Kostrov—displayed
no activity at all over a period of two and a half months, even
failing to send any letters either to the C.C. Bureau Abroad or to the C.C.


As a result of the 18–month effort to restore the C.C. in Russia, the
four Bolshevik members (Meshkovsky, Innokenty, Makar and Vyazemsky) are
either in exile or in prison. The gendarme inquiries and a whole number of
arrests have made it quite clear that the authorities are most thoroughly
informed about all the London
candidates{5} and C.C. members and that their every step is being
watched. In view of all these circumstances to make a fresh attempt to
convene the C.C. in Russia would be to court certain failure without any
hope of success.  

The only possible way out of this situation would be to call a Plenary
Meeting abroad. Nine persons with the right to take part in the Plenary
Meeting are
abroad.{6} This will constitute more than one-half of its full
membership (15 persons). They juridically can and essentially must declare
themselves to be the Plenary Meeting.  

The proposal to postpone the constitution of the Plenary Meeting until
the convocation of the other members would mean many more months of delay.


With the exception of Mikhail, Yuri and Roman, who have openly
announced their break with the C.C. and their sympathies for liquidating
the Party, the Mensheviks could “bring together” Kostrov and Pyotr. The
Bolsheviks could bring together Meshkovsky, Innokenty, Rozhkov and
Sammer. It is hard to say how many months this would take.  

In the light of the experience it has had, the real meaning for the
Party of this protracted “work of bringing together” formal candidates is
nil. It is even worse than nil, for the

    

game of allocating places in central bodies hides from local organisations
and groups the sad reality in respect of which vigorous action must be
taken. After eighteen months of unsuccessful attempts to restore the
activity of the C.C., to feed the Party with more endless delays would be
an affront to the Party. We do not intend to have a hand in any such
affront.  

At present the real position of the Party is such that almost
everywhere in the localities there are small Party workers’ groups and
cells that meet irregularly. They enjoy great prestige among the workers
everywhere. Every where they are combating liquidator-legalists in the
unions, clubs, etc. They are not yet connected with each other. Their
supplies of literature are extremely rare. In these groups of workers,
there is a rallying together of Bolsheviks, pro-Party Mensheviks and some
of the Vperyod
supporters{7} who have not been drawn into the separate
Vperyod faction set up abroad.  

The Vperyod group used all the period since the Plenary
Meeting to help from abroad in strengthening and separating its faction in
organisational terms. Its representatives have withdrawn from the
Diskussionny Listok Editorial
Board{8} and the School Commission under the
C.C.{9} The Vperyod group has failed to carry out the
decisions of the last Plenary Meeting, and has, in fact, done everything to
hamper the Social-Democratic general Party work. Preparations for the
forthcoming elections have long since been started in the legal and illegal
Party literature. Mean while, the Vperyod group, far from
assisting the Party in this extremely important political action, has even
failed to state unequivocally whether in general it favours participation
in the elections to the Fourth
Duma{10} or opposes participation in them. Even in their latest
statements in the press, the Vperyod group leaders abroad continue
to flirt with the otzovists.  

A far more serious anti-Party and anti-Social-Democratic force is the
faction of the independent legalists (Nasha
Zarya,{11} Dyelo
Zhizni,{12} and the Golos people who, like Dan, Martov
& Co., cover them up). It has been proved beyond doubt that they
recognise no Central Committee and publicly ridicule Central Committee
decisions. They cannot and

    

will not carry out the last Plenary Meeting’s decisions (“Not to minimise
the role of an illegal party”, etc.). They cannot help taking the
opposite line of action.  

No Social-Democrat can doubt that the “independent legalists” can be
expected to conduct an election campaign for the Fourth Duma on their own,
apart from and against the Party.  

The task of the Social-Democratic Party members is clear: the Party
workers’ circles in Russia should be openly and resolutely urged to start
preparations for the elections immediately. Only committed Party
men, only comrades realising the danger of the liquidationist trend should
be nominated as Social-Democratic candidates. Direct action
against independent legalists must not be postponed for a single day; the
workers must be warned right away of the danger posed to the
Social-Democratic Party by the independent legalists at the elections.


Such is the task of the day for our Party. Any deviation from such an
approach to the question, which has been posed by life itself (and by the
independent legalists), all delays, or attempts by the legalists to repeat
the game of “promises” and “assurances” are fraught with great danger
to the Party.  

Our practical conclusion: the meeting of the nine must absolutely and
immediately issue a manifesto to the Patty in which the failure to convene
the Central Committee in Russia is truthfully and fully described, and
which calls upon local Party circles to display initiative and establish
local and regional committees, to set up and support a Central Organising
Commission, to set up and support Social-Democratic press organs (where, as
in
Zvezda,{13} which is being published with the participation and
support of the Social-Democratic Duma group, there should be no place for
the liquidators), urging them to conduct a deter mined and implacable
struggle against the independent legalists and to make for closer ties in
their work between representatives of the true Party elements, without
regard for trend. In the event that not only five of the nine members of
the C.C., but a solid majority of the nine agree to regard themselves as a
Plenum of the C.C., this meeting of the C.C. must immediately co-opt new
members, set up an Organising

    

Commission for calling a conference and start practical preparations for
election to the Fourth Duma. Representatives of pro-Party Mensheviks should
be seated on the Organising Commission and the C.C. right away. The
C.C. meeting must at once start a resolute struggle against the independent
legalist group. It stands to reason that this struggle is incompatible with
the participation of independent legalists in central Party bodies, which
they have sabotaged, obstructed, weakened and kept in a morbid state for
eighteen months.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF CONSTITUTING THE MEETING

MAY 28 (JUNE 10)
1{14}

Considering that the Party has been suffering from the postponement of
the Plenum for 18 months, the non-Russian organisations should have long
since elected their representatives. The Latvian comrade’s approach was
different from that of the Bundist. He said that although he had not been
elected, in view of the conditions of the Plenary Meeting’s convocation he
deemed it his duty to take part in it, and to submit a subsequent report to
the C.C. of the Latvian Territory, with the proviso that the decisions
would enter into force in the Latvian Territory only upon their approval by
the C.C. of the Latvian Territory.  
2

In fact, comrades here are being
fooled.{15} We know that Makar and Lindov did something, contacted
organisations, appointed agents and contacted the candidate. They were
arrested. Since then we have had no news from any of those

    

who remained. They have even failed to inform either the C.O. or the
C.C. Bureau Abroad. No work has been done. It is no longer possible to
deceive the Party with a Russia
Bureau{16} or a Russia C.C. Convening the C.C. in Russia is a phrase
that helps Stolypin.  

Ionov’s statement says that he will send his invitation to the Bund
C.C.{17} When is he going to do so? How much time has elapsed? Why is
there no reply?  Ionov says that not having the powers he cannot attend a
meeting of the C.C. members. Why then is Lieber here? I propose a
resolution on Ionov’s reply, because it makes clear that an intrigue is
being carried on.  
3

Let us sum up what has been said about the Bureau. It turns out that
the remaining members of the Bureau were meant. About the work it is said
that no work has been done. Comrade Adrianov is a prominent Menshevik and
the Mensheviks would have been aware of his work if he had done any. Even
his closest associates know nothing about it. Any further attempt to play
up the existence of a bureau somewhere is to deceive the Party. In view of
the arrests, Ber could not contact the Bund C.C. What then is the Party to
do? It cannot afford to wait. There must be initiative in this case.  
4

Ber is shouting about the law, but at the same time he has been
resolutely fighting in the C.C. Bureau Abroad against the law and in favour
of the
liquidators.{18} This kind of behaviour makes me doubt the sincerity of
his statements and expect him to make fresh attempts to break up all-Party
institutions.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF CONVENING A C.C. PLENARY MEETING

MAY 30 (JUNE 12)
1{19}

I state that for six months the lower institution (C.C. Bureau Abroad)
has been violating decisions and refusing to convene the higher
institution. I am forced to state this in order to give a warning against
putting any trust in an institution which for six months now has been
trying to close the Party’s way to a resumption of its central institution.

2

I point out that as early as the spring of 1910 we had a letter from
Inok saying that C.C. members were being shadowed. We fought with every
means against the Russian
gamble.{20} Makar resumed the business in 1910 and the dispatch of money
right away revealed the hopelessness of the attempt. It was quite plain at
once that to call the C.C. in Russia meant to send people to gaol. From the
spring of 1908 to the 1910 Plenary Meeting the C.C. did not meet in Russia
a single time. The history of the convocation in Russia shows that the task
is unfeasible. Sending the C.C. to Russia was tantamount to sending it to
prison.  
3{21}

Over a period of 18 months, four Bolsheviks have been arrested while
doing central work. Not a single Menshevik has been arrested because they
have been working to set up a Stolypin party: Letters were not written to
us and correspondence was suspended for reasons of secrecy. The Mensheviks,
far from working to set up the C.C., even refused to attend for co-optation
(Mikhail, Roman and Yuri), Pyotr has been nowhere near the Bureau, while
Kostrov lived close by. It is an incontrovertible fact that only the
Bolsheviks have been working.  
 

Concerning Lyubich we have a letter from Inok indicating his consent to
work. Concerning Pyotr we merely have the information that he has been
nowhere near the Bureau. A C.C. member has the clear duty of going to work
on the C.C. Martynov is an émigré=Bogdanov, Nikita. If he is
invited, then they and Victor should be invited too. Mikhail, Yuri and
Roman have nothing to do with the C.C. These are men who are building a
Stolypin labour party and are engaged in activity which was resolutely
condemned by the January Plenary Meeting. We have nothing in common with
the architects of a Stolypin labour party or with those who are helping
them.

PROPOSAL FOR RESOLUTION ON CONVENING A PARTY CONFERENCE 

The Organising
Commission{22} has been recruiting for the work of convening a
conference representatives of local organisations in Russia and influential
comrades engaged in activity among the masses, so that they should, if
possible at once, set up a Russian collegium performing all the practical
work in convening the conference, under the general control of the
Organising Commission—in the sense of fulfilling directives stated in the
resolutions and the letter of the Plenary Meeting.

 STATEMENT{23} 

In voting for the resolution as a
whole{24} in order to bring together as closely as possible all the
Party elements without exception, we resolutely protest against the
permissibility

    

of inviting to the Organising Commission the Golos and the
Vperyod people abroad, i.e., representatives of anti-Party groups
which have developed into special factions abroad and which in the
18 months since the Plenary Meeting have proved themselves capable only of
acting against the Party, only of slowing down its work, only of
helping the independent legalist labour party or the otzovists.

Notes
 

[1]

This provisional bureau was recognised both by non-Russian
organisations and by our Party’s C.C. Bureau Abroad and C.O.  —Lenin
 



{2}

Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee members Living
abroad was held in Paris from May 28 to June 4 (June 10 to 17),
1911. It was prepared and called under Lenin’s direction apart from the
Central Committee Bureau Abroad, whose liquidationist majority had
repeatedly thwarted the convocation of a C.C. Plenary Meeting. Preparations
for the meeting began in April 1911. It was to take measures to call a
Plenary meeting of the Central Commit tee and eliminate the grave crisis in
which the Party found itself, being virtually without central governing
bodies. The meeting was attended by Bolsheviks, Polish and Latvian
Social-Democrats, one Golos man and one Bundist. The Latvian
Social-Democrat M. V. Ozolin announced that in accordance with a decision
of his Central Committee he would attend the meeting with voice only. The
Bundist Lieber said that he had not been authorised by the Bund C.C. to
represent it at the meeting.  

In view of the forthcoming elections to the Fourth Duma, the meeting
outlined measures to elaborate the Party’s tactics in the election campaign
and draft an electoral platform. The main item on the agenda was the
calling of a Party conference. Because it was impossible to call a Plenary
Meeting of the Central Committee right away, the meeting undertook to call
a conference, and set up an Organising Commission to prepare the
conference. The meeting adopted Lenin’s proposal to set up a Russian
collegium for practical work in preparing the conference (see p. 240). The
meeting decisions provided for invitations to Party organisations abroad to
work together on the Organising Commission. Lenin, who voted for the
resolution as a whole, lodged a protest against the invitation to the
Organising Commission of representatives of anti-Party groups—the
Golos and Vperyod followers (pp. 240–41).  

The meeting condemned the anti-Party, factional policy of the Central
Committee Bureau Abroad, and decided to refer the question of its existence
to the C.C. Plenary Meeting. In the voting on the last section of the
resolution, Lenin abstained, because he insisted on an immediate
reorganisation of the C.C.B.A. To handle technical matters (Party
publishing, transportation, etc.), the meeting set up a Technical
Commission which was to be responsible to the group of members and
alternate members of the Central Committee attending the meeting.  

A special bulletin issued after the meeting—“Announcement”—set
out the circumstances in which the meeting had been called, its composition
and purposes. It also contained the resolutions of the meeting.  

This meeting was an important step in mustering the Party forces, in
uniting them for the struggle against the Golos liquidators, the
Vperyod followers and the Trotskyites, and for strengthening the
Party. Its decisions helped to rally and strengthen local Party
organisations. To prepare a general Party conference, Lenin sent to Russia
experienced Party workers—the Bolsheviks G. K. Orjonikidze (Sergo),
B. A. Breslav (Zakhar) and I. I. Shvarts (Semyon). By September 1911, the
meeting decisions were approved by the committees and the Social-Democratic
organisations

   

of a number of towns in Russia. In September 1911, there was formed the
Russian Organising Commission, consisting of representatives of a number of
Social-Democratic organisations. The Commission prepared the convocation in
January 1912 of the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. For the material on the meeting see also present edition,
Vol. 17, pp. 195–205.

The Plenary Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, known
as the “unity” meeting, was held in Paris from January 3 to 23
(January 15 to February 5), 1910.  

It was attended by representatives of all factions and groups and of
non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations. The conciliators had a
majority at the meeting. Lenin conducted a persistent struggle against the
opportunists and conciliators to secure the condemnation of liquidationism
and otzovism and to bring the Bolsheviks and the pro-Party Mensheviks
closer together. On the agenda were these questions: 1) Report by the
Russian Bureau of the C.C. 2) Report by the C.C. Bureau Abroad. 3) Report
by the Editorial Board of the Central Organ. 4) Reports by the Central
Committees of the non-Russian Social-Democratic Parties.  5) State of
affairs in the Party. 6) Convocation of a regular Party conference. 7)
Rules of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, etc.  

On Lenin’s insistence, the Plenary Meeting adopted the resolution “On
the State of Affairs in the Party”, which condemned liquidationism and
otzovism, recognised the danger of these trends and urged the need to fight
them. Lenin said that the January Plenary Meeting finally determined the
Party’s tactical line during the counter-revolutionary period, deciding, in
pursuance of the resolutions of the Fifth (All-Russia) Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. (1908), that liquidationism and otzovism were manifestations of
bourgeois influence on the proletariat. The Plenary Meeting also connected
the question of the need to have real Party unity, with the Party’s
ideological and political tasks in the current historical period. At the
same time, Lenin sharply condemned the Plenary Meeting’s conciliatory
decisions.

Publicist” (present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 195–259).

The Rules of the Central Committee, adopted at the January 1910 Plenary
Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, said: “Plenary Meetings (of
15 members) shall be attended by

   

1) members of the collegium operating in Russia; 2) members of the
C.C. Bureau Abroad, with the exception of those who are not members of the
C.C.; 3) if these do not add up to the figure of 15, the other candidates
shall attend the Plenary Meeting in the following order: a) candidates of
the London Congress doing any Party work in Russia; b) members of the
C.C. and alternate members living abroad and engaged in work assigned to
them by the Central Committee” (K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh...,

The Vperyod group—an anti-Party group of otzovists,
ultimatumists and god-builders, organised on the initiative of A. Bogdanov
and G. A. Alexinsky in December 1909, following the break-up of the
otzovist-ultimatumist factional centre, the Capri school; it had a
periodical of the same name.  

The group, without any support in the working-class movement, broke up
in 1913 and 1914, but was formally dissolved after the bourgeois-democratic
revolution in February 1917.

published in Paris under a decision of the January Plenary Meeting of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee from March 6 (19), 1910, to April 29 (May 12),
1911. There were three issues. On its Editorial Board were representatives
of the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, ultimatumists, Bundists, Plekhanovites,
Polish Social-Democrats and Latvian Social-Democrats. It carried Lenin’s
articles “Notes of a Publicist”, “The Historical Meaning of the
Inner-Party Struggle in Russia” and “A Conversation Between a Legalist
and an Opponent of Liquidationism” (see present edition, Vol. 16,

national organisations—the Bund, the Latvian and the Polish
Social-Democrats.

The Fourth Duma opened on November 15 (28), 1912. Elections
were held in the autumn of 1912 under the reactionary electoral law of
June 3 (16), 1907, and were accompanied by a series of government measures
designed to create a Black-Hundred majority in the Duma. Lenin described
the election campaign and assessed the class and party composition of the
Duma in his article “Results of the Elections”

(see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 493–518).



The Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma included six
Bolsheviks—A. Y. Badayev, M. K. Muranov, G. I. Petrovsky, F. N. Samoilov,
N. R. Shagov and R. V. Malinovsky (who later was exposed as a provocateur),
seven Mensheviks and one member who did not enjoy full rights (the Warsaw
deputy, E. J. Jagiello), and who sided with the Mensheviks. Making use of
their slight numerical superiority, the Mensheviks hampered the work of the
group

   

and blocked the passage of a number of measures proposed by the
Bolsheviks. In October 1913, the Bolshevik deputies, on instructions from
the Central Committee, withdrew from the united Social-Democratic group and
formed their own. Lenin gave day-to-day guidance to the Bolshevik deputies
and taught them to make revolutionary use of the Duma rostrum.  

The Duma proved to be incapable of settling any major questions which
the country’s objective development brought up, and its work increasingly
boiled down to wordy debate. Its legislative activity was largely designed
to strengthen such pillars of the autocracy as the courts, the church and
the police.  

The Duma approved Russia’s entry into the First World War. The
Mensheviks and the S.R.s took a defencist stand. Only the Bolshevik Party
resolutely opposed the war. The Bolshevik group refused to vote the war
credits and started revolutionary propaganda in the masses. In November
1914, the Bolshevik deputies were arrested and committed for trial.  

In August 1915, the bourgeois and landowner groups set up a
“Progressive bloc”, consisting of more than one-half of the
deputies. Lenin said it was “the liberal-Octobrist bloc for the purpose of
reaching an understanding with the tsar on a programme of reforms and
mobilising industry for the victory over Germany”

(see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 378).



On February 26 (March 11), 1917, the tsar announced the dissolution of
the Fourth Duma, but, while not daring to protest openly, the deputies
decided to continue their sittings unofficially. On February 27 (March 12)
they formed a Provisional Committee of the Duma to fight the revolution and
save the monarchy. By agreement with the S.R. and Menshevik representatives
of the Petrograd Soviet, the Committee decided to set up a bourgeois
Provisional Government. The Committee’s members were rabid enemies of the
revolution, and at their private meetings demanded the establishment of a
military dictatorship and the abolition of the Soviets. On October 6 (19),
1917, under the pressure of the revolutionary masses, the bourgeois
Provisional Government was forced to decree the dissolution of the Duma.

Nasha Zarya (Our Dawn)—a legal monthly of the Menshevik
liquidators published in St. Petersburg from January 1910 to September
1914. It was edited by A. N. Potresov, and among its contributors were
F. I. Dan and S. 0. Tsederbaum (V. Yezhov). It was the liquidationist
centre in Russia. A resolution of the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference
of the R.S.D.L.P. (1912) said that “a section of the Social-Democrats,
grouped round the journals Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni,
have openly come out in defence of a trend which the whole Party has
recognised as a product of bourgeois influence on the proletariat”
(K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh..., Part I, p. 283).

Zvezda (The Star)—a legal Bolshevik newspaper published in
St. Petersburg from December 16 (29), 1910, to April 22 (May 5), 1912. It
was initially published as a weekly, twice a week from January 21
(February  3), 1912, and three times a week from March 8 (21), 1912.  

Lenin gave ideological guidance to the newspaper: he carried on a
correspondence with the members of the Editorial Board, directing their
work, criticising their mistakes, especially in the initial period of its
publication, struggling for the paper’s consistent Marxist approach. A
great deal of editorial and organisational work was done by N. N. Baturin,
N. G. Poletayev, K. S. Yeremeyev and M. S. Olminsky. Among those who took
an active part in the paper were V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich and Demyan Bedny. It
carried a number of articles by G. V. Plekhanov. Lenin got Maxim Gorky to
write for it. Zvezda enjoyed great prestige among the working
people of Russia.

The attendant circumstances were as follows: the Golos
Menshevik B. I. Gorev (Goldman) came out against the presence at the
meeting of the representatives of non-Russian organisations, M. I. Lieber
of the Bund and M. V. Ozolin of the Latvian Social-Democrats, without
mandates from their Central Committees. Lieber said they had had no time to
contact their centres and that he was not representing the Bund.

The Central Committee Bureau in Russia was elected at a
general meeting of the Collegium of C. C. members, which was active in
Russia from 1908. The Bureau was in charge of all the affairs of the
Russian Collegium in between general meetings of the C.C. In 1910 and 1911,
after the January 1910 Plenary Meeting of the C.C., the Bureau in Russia
consisted of the following members and alternate members of the Central
Committee: the Bolsheviks I. P. Goldenberg (Meshkovsky) and
I. F. Dubrovinsky (Innokenty), and after their arrest, V. P. Nogin (Makar)
and G. D. Leiteisen (Lindov). The Menshevik liquidators, members and
alternate members of the C.C., kept aloof from its work, while I. A. Isuv
(Mikhail), P. A. Bronstein (Yuri) and K. M. Yermolayev (Roman) not only
refused to participate but declared that they considered the very existence
of the C.C. to be harmful. All the efforts of the Bureau to call the
Russian Collegium failed.  

In March 1911, following the arrest of Nogin and Leiteisen, the Central
Committee Bureau in Russia ceased to exist. Lenin gave a positive
evaluation of the Russia Bureau’s efforts to organise work in Russia and
call the C.C.’s Russian Collegium, but sharply criticised the members’
conciliatory stand.  

At the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., the
Bureau in Russia was re-established. It consisted of C.C. members:

   

G. K. Orjonikidze, S. S. Spandaryan, J. V. Stalin and Y. M. Sverdlov, and
alternate C.C. members: M. I. Kalinin, Y. D. Stasova and others. In view of
frequent arrests of Party workers in Russia, the composition of the Bureau
was subsequently changed many times, new members being co-opted in place of
the old ones. After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917,
the Bureau in Russia ceased to operate.

A statement by the Bundist Ionov (F. M. Koigen) said that not having

opportunity.

The Organising Commission (Organising Commission Abroad,
O.C.A.) for convening a general Party conference was set up by the
C.C. members’ meeting on June 1 (14), 1911, and consisted of Bolsheviks,
conciliators and Polish Social-Democrats. Other organisations and groups
abroad invited to take part in the commission did not send their
representatives. The O.C. sent G.K. Orjonikidze as its agent to Russia to
work for the preparation of a general Party conference, and issued an
appeal “To All Social-Democratic Party Organisations, Groups and
Circles”, urging them to start elections to the Russian Organising
Commission.  

As a result of the work carried out by the Bolsheviks, the R.O.C. was
set up. At the end of October, the O.C.A. discussed the R.O.C.’s
“Announcement” of its constitution and resolutions stating that it
assumed full powers in calling the conference and that the Organising and
Technical Commissions Abroad were to be subordinate to the R.O.C. When the
conciliatory majority of the O.C.A. refused to abide by these decisions,
the Bolsheviks left the O.C.A. On October 30 (November 12), Orjonikidze,
who had arrived in Paris, gave a report in the O.C.A. on the activity of
the R.O.C. after which the O.C.A. was forced to recognise the governing
role of the R.O.C. But soon the O.C.A. started an open struggle against the
R.O.C. On November 20 (December 3) it issued a leaflet, “Open Letter to
the Russian Organising Commission”, accusing the latter of factional
activity. The O.C.A.’s anti-Party activity was exposed by Orjonikidze in
his “Letter to the Editorial Board” carried in No. 25 of
Sotsial-Demokrat on December 8 (21), 1911.

   

All the work of calling the general Party conference, held in January 1912,
was carried out by the R.O.C., which rallied together the illegal Party
organisations in Russia.

In our capacity as members of the meeting we, the
under-signed, having learned of the decision of the Technical
Commission{2} not to issue any money to the
school,{3} declare that we consider this decision downright illegal and
motion the following proposal for a vote by the members of the meeting:
Members of the meeting resolve that the amount required for the
school (for travelling or living expenses not later than
September 1, 1911) should be issued from cash (or the
trustee funds)—in accordance with the decision of the Party’s
School Commission.  

July 30, 1911

The Technical Commission (Technical Commission Abroad,
T.C.A.) was set up by the June meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. members
at their sitting of June 1 (14), 1911, to perform the technical work in
connection with Party publishing, transportation, etc. As a temporary
organ, pending a C.C. Plenary Meeting, the T.C.A. was subordinate to the
group of C.C. members who took part in the June meeting. It consisted of
one representative each from the Bolsheviks, the conciliators and the
Polish Social-Democrats. The conciliatory majority of the
T.C.A.—M. K. Vladimirov and V. L. Leder, who supported him—held lip the
issue of money for the O.C.A., which was to go into a fund for the
convocation of the Party conference, as well as appropriations for
publishing the Bolshevik newspaper Zvezda; it also tried to hold
up the publication of the Party’s Central Organ, the newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat. In its press organ—-Informatsionny
Bulleten (Information Bulletin)—the T.C.A. attacked Lenin and the
Bolsheviks. During the discussion of the “Announcement” and the
resolutions of the R.O.C. at the T.C.A.’s sitting of October 19
(November 1), the Bolshevik M. F. Vladimirsky motioned that the
T.C.A. abide by the decisions of the R.O.C. The motion was
rejected. Vladimirsky withdrew, and the Bolsheviks severed all ties with
the T.C.A.

A reference to the Party school at Longjumeau, a few
kilometres from Paris, set up by the Bolsheviks under Lenin’s guidance in
the spring of 1911 for the workers of Party organisations of the major
proletarian centres in Russia. There were 13 students representing Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Baku, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Nikolayev, Tiflis, Sormovo,
Yekaterinoslav Gubernia, Dabrowa District (Poland) and 5 external
students. Among them were I. S. Belostotsky, B. A. Breslav, I. D. Chugurin,
A. I. Dogadov, A. I. Ivanova, G. K. Orjonikidze, I. V. Prisyagin,
E. Prukhnyak, I. I. Shvarts and Y. D. Zevin. Most of them were Bolsheviks,
but there were some pro-Party Mensheviks and one Vperyod man. The
lecturers were chosen by the School Committee together with the
students. Invitations to lecture were sent out to representatives of
various trends in the R.S.D.L.P. The Mensheviks L. Martov, F. I. Dan and
others declined, and most of the lecturers were Bolsheviks.  

Lenin was the school’s ideological guide and its principal
lecturer. When two-thirds of the students had arrived, Lenin held classes
on the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Frederick
Engels. Lenin read 29 lectures (43 hours) on political economy

   

and 12 lectures (18 hours) on the agrarian question. Under the initial
plan, the lectures on philosophy were to be given by G. V. Plekhanov. When
it turned out that he was not coming after all, the students asked Lenin to
give the lectures, and he read three on the materialist view of
history. Also at the students’ request, Lenin spoke on the present
situation and the state of affairs in the Party.  

After completing the course on August 17 (30), the students went back
for illegal work in Russia. They took an active part in preparing and
holding the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. Many of
those who graduated from the school subsequently became leading Party and
Soviet Government workers.

A choice should be made between the party of the revolutionary
proletariat and the party of the independent legalists. Every circle or
group of the R.S.D.L.P. must tell the workers as much and practise it.

 

We know that there are people who, while recognising the need to fight
the liquidators, object to a complete break with them and continue (even
now!)  to speak of “conciliation” or “agreement”. Among these people
are not only the “loyal servitors” of Trotsky, whom very few people now
take seriously. The advocates of conciliation and agreement are making a
big mistake: the 18 months have shown in practice that the
legalists do not fulfil any obligations. How can there be an
agreement with men who do not carry out their obligations?? Isn’t it
ridiculous to speak of an agreement, when the speaker is unable to state
either the terms of the agreement or the means to secure
fulfilment of any terms whatsoever??

1. Why does N. Rozhkov’s article in No. 9–10 of Nasha
Zarya deserve such a name and the most thorough analysis? It affords
an opportunity of examining the question of the two lines in the labour
movement and the “two parties” outside any “conflict”
material, outside any “squabble”.  

2. The type of “Social-Democrat of freedom days”. Bourgeois democrats
in Marxist garb. Rozhkov as a specimen; his article is a wholesale
substitution of liberalism for Marxism.  

3. The role of the serf-owners in modern Russia from the standpoint of
the liberals (Rozhkov) and the Marxists. The “December (1908)
resolutions” of the R.S.D.L.P.  

4. The attitude of democrats to the (Stolypin) solution of the agrarian
problem “through a compromise between various groups of the bourgeoisie”.


5. Is Russia to have a “triumph of highly moderate bourgeois
progressism”?  
 

6. A comparison of modern Russia with her Third Duma and France of the
1860s with her Legislative Corps, and Prussia of 1880s.  

7. Have the “old slogans” become a “dead letter”?  

8. Why is the Society for the Protection of the Interests of the
Working Class, which is being set up by Rozhkov, a society for the
liberal protection of working-class interests in their
liberal interpretation?  

9. Ratio: Y. Larin is to the labour congress as N. Rozhkov is to the
legal liquidationist party.

In electing a Committee of the Organisation
Abroad{2} to handle the latter’s affairs the meeting hands it the draft
Rules together with all the remarks, authorising the Commit tee to poll the
groups and give final approval to the Rules through such a poll.  

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The proposal was motioned by Lenin at a meeting of Bolshevik groups
abroad held in Paris on December 16 (29), 1911, when it was examining the
question of whether there should be a detailed discussion of the draft
Rules of the Organisation Abroad at the meeting itself, or whether they
should be referred to the Committee of the Organisation Abroad for
co-ordination with the groups and final approval. Lenin’s proposal was
adopted by eight votes to one.  

The meeting was held in Paris from December 14 to 17 (27 to 30), 1911,
under Lenin’s direction. It was called on the initiative of the Paris
circle for the promotion of the Bolshevik Rabochaya Gazeta, and
was aimed at uniting the Bolshevik forces abroad and promoting the
convocation of an all-Russia Party conference. It was attended by
11 delegates with vote from the Bolshevik groups of Paris, Nancy, Zurich,
Davos, Geneva, Liége, Berne, Bremen and Berlin. The Bolsheviks of
Toulouse, Lausanne, London, Brussels, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Nice and other
cities were unable to send their representatives for technical and
financial reasons. Some Bolshevik groups managed to send in detailed
reports. On the agenda were these items: 1) reports of the Organising
Bureau and delegates from the localities; 2) the state of affairs in the
Party; 3) the state of affairs abroad and attitude to the various trends;
4) organisational matters; 5) the tasks of work abroad; 6) attitude to the
conference; 7) other matters.  

The meeting declared the final break-away of the Golos and
Vperyod supporters from the Party, their complete bankruptcy, and
approved the measures of the June meeting of the C.C. members on convening
a Party conference. The meeting adopted the resolution motioned by Lenin on
support for the Russian Organising Commission and the conference it was
trying to call, and resolved to set up the R.S.D.L.P. Organisation Abroad
(with local sections)

   

on the basis of conducting a true Party line, without allowing any
agreements with the liquidators; it also elected the Committee of the
Organisation Abroad.  

The meeting united the Bolshevik groups abroad into a single
organisation, approved the formation of the R.O.C. and declared that “it
is the duty of every Party member to support it to the utmost”.

p. 243





{2}

The Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. Organisation Abroad
(C.O.A.) was elected at a meeting of the Bolshevik groups abroad
held in Paris in December 1911. It included N. A. Semashko,
M. F. Vladimirsky, Inessa Armand and others. The work of the C.O.A. was
directed by Lenin. It played an important part in rallying the Party forces
and in the struggle against the Menshevik liquidators, the conciliators,
the Trotskyites and other opportunists. The C.O.A. responded to all the
major events in Russia and measures in directing Party work and the Russian
revolutionary movement, and also helped the C.C. to publish Party
literature abroad. It ceased functioning in 1917.

 Political Situation 

1. Crop failure—and the famine. “Food”
campaign—Lidvaliad.{2} 

2. Stolypin’s “agrarian reform”: bourgeois wine poured into
serf-owning wineskins. They burst.  
 

3. December 1908 about the Stolypin
reform{3} and failure of the liquidators and the Vperyod
people to understand.  

4. Commissary trials: stealing.  

5. Mismanagement and disorder.

 —Cadet and Octobrist press. Flight from St. Petersburg to Moscow,
lorry runs, construction of railways, Russian industry in the foreign
market, public education and Kasso’s
“broom”{4}— ——sighs, oh’s and ah’s, and regrets all over the
place.  

6. The bourgeoisie craves for the bourgeois system. It wants to “wash
the wineskin without dipping it into the water”.  

7. Revolution is the only way. Fear, hatred, mistrust—against the
tide.  

8. “Against the tide”. For the revolution. The working class and the
revolution. For revolution
  (n o t  “universal suffrage”) is the slogan which sums up
the political situation and determines the whole content of Party
agitation and propaganda (in particular, before the Fourth Duma).

2. Attitude to the revolution that was: spite, fear,

Lidvaliad—the case of the big swindler and speculator
E. Lidval and V. I. Gurko, Deputy Minister for the Interior. With Gurko’s
help, Lidval concluded a deal with the government to supply 10 million
poods of rye to the famine-stricken gubernias of Russia from October to
December 1906. Having received a sizable advance through Gurko from the
treasury, Lidval brought up less than 10 per cent of the total quantity of
grain to the railway lines by mid-December 1906. This embezzlement and
speculation on the famine were exposed and widely reported, forcing the
tsarist government to institute legal proceedings. But apart from being
removed from his post, Gurko was not punished in any way.

secondary schools in St. Petersburg at a meeting in Vitmer’s private
school. The pupils were suspected by the secret police of belonging to an
illegal circle. The question was discussed at the 12th, 17th, 18th, 19th
and 20th sittings of the Duma. On February 6 (19), 1913, a majority adopted
a formula to proceed with the business of the Duma, recognising the
Minister’s explanations as being unsatisfactory.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU

 JANUARY 7 (20), 1912 

The work at the I.S.B. falls into two parts, one routine:
correspondence, distribution of members ... etc.; the other—congresses:
Copenhagen and
Zurich.{8} Following the London Congress one [representative] was [on
the I.S.B.] from the Russian Social-Democrats. The Plenary Meeting also
elected Plekhanov, but he refused, saying that one man was enough to do the
work. At the Copenhagen Congress we drew closer together and spoke in a
friendly manner; I was no longer able to talk to the Golos people
and looked at Trotsky with disapproval, especially over the
letter.{9} Towards the end of the sitting, Plekhanov accepted the
Plenary Meeting’s proposal. He and I have one vote. Until recently we have
had no conflicts of any kind. At Copenhagen I worked on the co-operative
commit tee. Of most interest are the extremely aggravated relations among
the German Social-Democrats: unity on the surface and two different trends
beneath. On behalf of the German Social-Democrats, one half represents the
party and the other, the trade unions. The greater the German delegation
numerically, the lower seems the hegemony of the German Social-Democrats to
decline. At Stuttgart they covered themselves with disgrace by voting for
the colonial resolution.... One of their representatives, for instance,
says that it is impossible to expropriate the capitalists. It turns out
that in this context their programme says nothing at all about
expropriation. What they are actually conducting is not a Social-Democratic
line. There should be no illusions about this, for as time goes on the
struggle is bound to sharpen and grow; of course, the mass of the
proletariat will not vacillate. They staged a walk-out at the Magdeburg
Congress, but no Social-Democrat will be intimidated by that kind of
thing.{10} 

There is a split among the
Czechs.{11} We were against the split, feeling that the Social-Democrats
should not succumb to any chauvinist or nationalist agitation. In Austria,
there are a great many scandals over the language

    

to be used in the paper work, etc. Plekhanov was the rapporteur on this
split, and his resolution was adopted by a large majority. There again,
Trotsky tried his reconciliation, saying that the fault lay with Adler, the
most “peaceable” and opportunist Social-Democrat.  

The German Social-Democrats are undoubtedly approaching a new
epoch—the epoch of the socialist revolution. The economic and military
crisis and world complications, all tend to bring out the symptoms of the
epoch. There has been preparatory work so far. Now it is the epoch of
battles against the bourgeoisie. And that is where the distinction between
the reformists and the revolutionary Social-Democrats is being realised. A
sitting of the I.S.R. was called at Zurich over Morocco. There was also an
incident there. Molkenbuhr wrote a letter in his own name suggesting that
no sitting should be held. Rosa Luxemburg published the letter, and that
sparked things
off.{12} The revolutionary Social-Democrats won out at the last
congress. Bebel said that he would take action against Rosa
Luxemburg. There was an attempt on the part of the French to get the strike
written into the resolution as a means of struggle against war. All the
revolutionary Social-Democrats spoke against, arguing that we should not
let the government know in advance which weapon we shall take up, and which
is most suitable and where. The proposal was rejected. Bebel raised the
question of non-publication of the documents, hinting at Rosa Luxemburg and
demanding a resolution. I stood up for Rosa Luxemburg. To Bebel’s great
indignation I quoted Quelch. There Bebel acted as a conciliator. The letter
published by Rosa Luxemburg has nothing to do with the [other]
documents. Action in the party was the most that should be done against
her, and that was done; it was unfair to take the whole thing to the
I.S.B....  

Various trends have grown up within German Social-Democracy and are
bursting to get out; inside, the party is seething. Resolute action is
imminent there. A conflict between the reformist and the revolutionary
Social-Democrats is inevitable.

 SPEECH ON THE ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION ON COMBATING THE FAMINE 
 JANUARY 8 (21), 1912 

The Party should intervene actively, and a resolution
should be adopted. As we have discovered from our exchange of opinion, the
workers are paying a great deal of attention to the famine and are actively
intervening and helping the starving. Helping the starving is not
philanthropy. It is philanthropy only with the bourgeois approach. But that
is not all. The Cadets have really adopted the stand point of the ministry
officials. We should join the commit tees which are being set up to fight
the famine. I mean the non-Party workers’ committees. We should not
prescribe their establishment but we should take part in them. The money
should best be sent to the Social-Democratic group, the workers’ unions,
clubs and other societies. We should also publish a leaflet, but preferably
addressed to the workers and peasants. We should see to the distribution of
the speech by Markov II, who said the starving peasants were idlers. It is
a fine speech and makes good reading.

 SPEECH ON THE ORGANISATIONAL QUESTION 
 JANUARY 11 (24), 1912 

I should like to deal with another aspect of the question. It is about
flexibility.... The resolution was
correct.{13} I should like to call attention to which side is
important. Let us take a legal society as an example. I can’t say this
about the whole of Russia, but about 5 towns I can say that ... it is
possible. And so what does a legal society give us above all? Lectures of a
Marxist character: this seems to be permitted. I see from the press that
they are permitted in the big towns. It is said that lecturers are hard to
come by.... The workers themselves should bring out the lecturers and pay
them. Then there are the library and reading room. I don’t know whether
they are allowed to take Zvezda. Then, legal societies arrange all
kinds of entertainment. That is important from the financial side, and,
besides, the entertainment makes it a kind of club. Now if this type of
society is not a fiction, but a reality, and there is no question about
that, we should ask ourselves [whether] we have worked to extend such
societies. [Whether] we have given reports about such societies at
factories and plants. Have we tried to organise such societies? Further,
how are these societies to be used? We are now almost similar in type to
the German organisation in the epoch of the anti-Socialist laws, but for us
it is both harder and

    

easier. It is harder because legal possibilities were open to them. The
C.C. consisted of members of the parliamentary party group, met legally and
invited illegal workers. For our part, we have a great deal of sympathy in
the masses and support for Social-Democracy. In every society we should
have small Social-Democratic cells closely bound up with the Party,
deciding on each matter in the spirit of the Party’s resolutions.... These
cells should not be as unwieldy as the districts and
subdistricts. St. Petersburg and Riga fit the [legal] society type. In
Moscow, little was done in this respect. And so we find these cells
allowing a different type of Party structure. In the past, in my time, we
had to do everything ourselves. Today, the trade unions and organisations
handle some of the work. Whenever possible, the political struggle is
frequently also conducted by the legal Duma group, and if we had more legal
societies built on these lines, the revolution would be invincible. That is
the question of the organisations’ flexibility. It will be the ideal for
rebuilding our organisation. These illegal cells surrounded by a network of
legal cells will give us a new basis. All contacts should be reduced to a
minimum, as though the organisation is and is not there. Let there be no
meetings. Party work has assumed a different form. The new form has already
wedged into the old. Let it be less formalised but expanding through work
in the legal societies. Every step towards culture should be permeated with
the Social-Democratic spirit, with Social-Democratic culture.... This will
be a resolute fight against the liquidators.... There is a cell, which is
connected with the C.O., contacting it once a year and doing a hundred
times more than before. We have not done enough in the legal societies. We
must wrest them from the hands of the liberals, we must [wrest] the entire
legal movement. The legal societies should be spread out and
expanded. Concrete attention should be given to how work is being organised
in the legal societies. Everywhere the illegal cells should be surrounded
by a network of legal cells.

 TO THE DRAFT RESOLUTION “ON THE CHARACTER AND ORGANISATIONAL FORMS OF
PARTY
       WORK” {3}


Insert at the beginning (α) confirmation of the December 1908
resolution or confirmation of its correctness on the strength of the three
years’ experience; (β) recognition that the work of local
Social-Democratic forces is creating a type of party here which is
approximating to the German one of
1878–90.{14} We should go forward along this road

 [[BOX ENDS:

 this instead of § 1

]].  

In thesis 5, throw out formalisation and instead of
“expansion” say strengthening.  

§ 7—reword more cautiously, as in December 1908.  

§ 9—set out to the effect that the regular distribution of a
regularly and frequently published illegal Social-Democratic newspaper is
of especial importance for political agitation, for directing the
revolutionary struggle,
  a n d  f o r  l i n k i n g  u p

all the illegal organisations and illegal cells in the various
societies.

 MATERIAL FOR THE RESOLUTION ON THE “PETITION
     CAMPAIGN”{4}

 Resolution on the Petition Campaign 

Themes: 

1) writers’ invention unrelated to the masses, [not] com[ing] from the
masses; 

2) indifferent signing without clear [slogans], without agitation in
the [masses], without interest [on the part of the masses];

 

3) the text and the character of the petition are unsatisfactory; 

4) wresting a partial demand, while the circumstances obtrude generally
elementary conditions of freedom [for] the whole people; 

5) failure: 1,300 signatures. No support in Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, the
Caucasus, etc.; 

6) the interest in proletarian meetings has shown that the “[wa]ys”
to the masses should be sought not where the liquidators want to.


Sum total: 

Recognise failure as final.  

Petition on the concrete conditions [of the epoch]—one of the least
[suitable] means of agitation.  

Call to agitation for freedom [of coalition] in connection
with general [political] demands and revolutionary agitation in the
masses.  

Draft resolution 

To recognise: 

1) that the [so]-called “petition campaign” was started by a [group
of St. Petersburg writers] of the liquidationist trend, without being a
product [of mass struggle], without being connected with active initiative
... by workers’ organisations or forward-looking workers; 

2) that the said [campaign in virtue of the character] of the petition,
and in virtue of the general political conditions, has [inevitably
degenerated into a purely formal] and indifferent signing of [a paper]
which is of no interest to the masses, [without] broad participation by the
workers themselves in discussing ... the petition either in the press or at
meetings; 

3) that the said petition, circulated and commented upon by the
liquidators, advanced an isolated demand for political freedom for one
class, the [most] advanced and most revolutionary class, making the demand
[outside the general] elementary conditions of political freedom for [the
whole people], thereby distorting the tasks in the struggle of the
proletariat—[the leader]... of the whole people—against tsarism and
dooming the “campaign” to [failure]; 

4) that the outcome of the [petition campaign] in question has clearly
confirmed that [the whole] scheme was

    

wrong and isolated from [the workers’ mass]: the petition collected only
1,300 signatures, [while] in all the Party organisations, including those
[in the Caucasus], Yekaterinoslav and Kiev, and even ... sympathising with
the liquidators, the petition campaign, clearly not supported by the
[masses], [failed to win] any support at all, just as the [campaign] was
given no support [by our Social-Democratic group in the Duma].

The Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. was held from January 5 to 17 (18 to 30), 1912. It had the
actual importance of a congress and was directed by Lenin. He gave reports

   

on the present situation and the Party’s tasks, on the work of the
International Socialist Bureau, and also spoke on other questions. Lenin
drafted resolutions on all the important items of the agenda.  

Of tremendous theoretical and practical importance were the Conference
resolutions on “Liquidationism and the Group of Liquidators” and “The
Party Organisation Abroad”. The Conference declared that by their
behaviour the liquidators had finally placed themselves outside the Party,
and expelled them from the R.S.D.L.P. The Conference condemned the activity
of anti-Party groups abroad: the Mensheviks supporting Golos, the
Vperyod group and the Trotskyites. It recognised as absolutely
necessary the existence of a single Party organisation abroad working under
the supervision and direction of the Central Committee to promote the
Party, and said that the groups abroad which “refuse to submit to the
Russian centre of Social-Democratic work, i.e., the Central Committee, and
introduce disorganisation because of their separate contacts with Russia in
obviation of the Central Committee, have no right to use the name of the
R.S.D.L.P.” The Conference adopted a resolution on “The Character and
Organisational Forms of Party Work”, approved Lenin’s draft organisational
Rules of the Party, endorsed the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat as the
Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., elected the Central Committee and set up
the C.C. Bureau in Russia.  

The Prague Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. played an outstanding part in
building up the Bolshevik Party, a new type of party, and in strengthening
its unity. It summed up the results of a whole historical period of the
Bolshevik struggle against the Mensheviks, and by expelling the Menshevik
liquidators from the Party, consolidated the Bolshevik victory; the
Conference laid down the Party’s political line and tactics in the
conditions of the fresh revolutionary upsurge.  

The Prague Conference was of great international importance.  It showed
the revolutionary elements of the parties in the Second International an
example of resolute struggle against opportunism, taking the struggle to a
complete break with the opportunists.  For details about the Prague
Conference see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 451–86.

p. 245





{6}

Lenin made the remark in connection with the proposal of a vote of
thanks to the R.O.C. for the work it had done in rallying all the Party
organisations in Russia and calling the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., and to let its representative attend the
Conference with vote

(see present edition, Vol. 17, p. 482).

p. 245





{7}

The Russian Organising Commission (R.O.C.) was set up
by the June 1911 meeting of the C.C. members to convene an a11-Russia Party
conference. It was constituted at a meeting of representatives of local
Party organisations at the end of September and functioned until the
opening of the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.

{8}

A reference to the sitting of the International Socialist Bureau in
Zurich on September 23 and 24, 1911.

p. 247





{9}

During the work of the International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen,
members of the Russian delegation, V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov and Adolf
Warski (A. S. Warszawski), representing the Polish Social-Democrats, sent a
protest to the Executive of the German Social-Democratic Party over the
publication in Vorw\"arts, its Central Organ, of L. Trotsky’s
article containing slanderous attacks on the R.S.D.L.P. (for the protest,
see Lenin, Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 47,
pp. 296–98).  

Lenin also came out against Trotsky’s slanderous campaign, in the
newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat No. 17 of September 25 (October 8),
1910, in an article entitled “How Certain Social-Democrats Inform the
International About the State of Affairs in the R.S.D.L.P.”, and in
Diskussionny Listok No. 3 of April 29 (May 12), 1911, in his
article “The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Struggle in Russia”
(see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 284–86, 374–92).

p. 247





{10}

A reference to the walk-out from the Magdeburg Congress of the German
Social-Democratic Party, held from September 18 to 24, 1910, of the
Social-Democratic deputies of the Baden Landtag. The Social-Democratic
group of the Baden Landtag voted for the

government

budget

despite the decisions of earlier party congresses which prohibited
Social-Democratic deputies from voting for the bourgeois government’s
budget. By an overwhelming majority of 289 votes to 80, the Magdeburg
Congress condemned the opportunist tactics of the Radon
Social-Democrats. The latter then announced that they would reserve the
right not to submit to Congress decisions. In response, the majority of the
Congress adopted a special resolution immediately expelling from the Party
anyone violating the Congress decision on budget voting. Before the
resolution was adopted, the Baden deputies staged a walk-out.  

For details about the Magdeburg Congress see Lenin’s article “Two
Worlds”

(present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 305–13).

p. 247





{11}

A reference to the differences between the Czech and Austrian
Social-Democrats over trade union unity. At the Extraordinary Congress of
Austrian Trade Unions in December 1905, the Czech Social-Democrats demanded
the establishment of national trade unions with jurisdiction extending over
the whole of Austria. The proposal was rejected by a vast majority, but the
Czechs refused to submit to the Congress decision. In 1910, the Austrian
Social-Democrats took the matter to the International Socialist Congress at
Copenhagen, which rejected the separatist Czech proposal and came out
unanimously for trade union unity.

p. 247





{12}

A reference to the letter sent by the opportunist Molkenbuhr to the
Executive of the German Social-Democratic Party proposing that no criticism
should be made of the German Government’s colonial policy in view of the
impending elections to the Reichstag. Rosa Luxemburg published the letter.

p. 248





{13}

A reference to the resolution on the organisational question adopted by
the Fifth Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., which was held in Paris from
December 21 to 27, 1908 (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh..., Part I,
pp. 201–03).

p. 250





{14}

A reference to the illegal Social-Democratic Party of Germany during
the period of the Anti-Socialist Law introduced by the Bismarck government
in 1878 to fight the working-class and socialist movement. The law banned
all organisations of the Social-Democratic Party, mass workers’
organisations and the labour press; socialist literature was confiscated;
the Social-Democrats were harassed and exiled. But the Social-Democratic
Party prevailed in the face of these persecutions, and reorganised its
activity to meet the, illegal conditions; its Central Organ, the newspaper
Sozial-Demokrat, was published abroad and party congresses met
regularly (1880, 1883 and 1887) outside the country; in the underground in
Germany, the Social-Democratic organisations and groups were being rapidly
revived under the leadership of an illegal C.C. At the same time, the party
made wide use of legal opportunities to strengthen its ties with the
masses, and its influence continued to grow: the number of votes It won at
the Reichstag elections in 1890 was more than three times greater than in
1878. The German Social-Democrats received great assistance from Karl Marx
and Frederick Engels. In 1890, the Anti-Socialist Law was abolished under
pressure from the massive and ever growing working-class movement.

A reference to the fusillade of unarmed workers at the Lena gold mines
in Siberia on April 4 (17), 1912. News of the tragedy aroused the working
class of Russia, and the country was swept by demonstrations, meetings and
protest strikes. The Social-Democratic group in the Duma tabled a question
to the tsarist government ever the Lena fusillade. The tsarist Minister
Maklakov gave this brazen reply: “That’s how it was, and that’s how it
will be in the future!” This intensified the indignation of the
workers. Up to 300,000 workers took part in the protest strikes against the
Lena fusillade, and they merged with the May Day strikes involving

   

up to 400,000 workers. Lenin wrote: “The Lena shootings led to the
revolutionary temper of the masses developing into a revolutionary upswing
of the masses”

(see present edition, Vol. 18, p. 103).

Rosa Luxemburg’s statement in VorwÃ¤rts (on
September 14) in defence of the so-called Polish Vorstand and carrying
charges against Comrade Radek has forced me to take up the pen despite my
great unwillingness to interfere in this matter. I cannot remain
silent. when the struggle against the liquidators of the Russian Party is
being used to vindicate the worst methods of the liquidators.  

I have personally witnessed Comrade Radek’s vacillation from defence of
the extreme Left to defence of the Russian liquidators; I have always
fought and will continue to fight politically against all those who defend
liquidationism, but that is precisely why I must stand up against
the disgusting methods used by the so-called Polish Vorstand in the Radek
“affair”{21} 

What is the principal specific of Martov’s “well-known” (bekannt)
pamphlet, of which Rosa Luxemburg makes such opportune
mention?{22} 

It is that Martov, the leader of the liquidators, after all
the Social-Democrats of Russia, in January 1910, solemnly and unanimously
accepted the condemnation of liquidationism and after peace in the
Party was proclaimed on the basis of this
condemnation{23}—a year later, when the liquidators destroyed the
Party’s C.C. and split away from the Party—Martov put out a pamphlet
accusing his opponents of 1,001 dishonest and criminal offences. At the
time the Poles called this pamphlet a “stinkbomb”, and even
(sogar, and not selbst) Kautsky called it
   “abscheulich”.{1}


The very same thing has now been done by the so-called Polish Vorstand
with Rosa Luxemburg at its head.  

Comrade Radek was recommended

  t o  m e  p e r s o n a l l y,

in 1909 and 1910, as a fitting

  c o l l a b o r a t o r  f o r  o u r  Party’s
C. 0. and was personally introduced to me, with the best of
references, at the International Congress at Copenhagen, by the
selfsame members of this very Vorstand.  

But then, in 1911, Comrade Radek took a political stand against this
Vorstand, supporting the Party’s Warsaw

    

Committee, a number of Party members and two of its prominent leaders
(Malecki and Hanecki), who exposed the Vorstand for disorganising
activity. Comrade Radek helped to establish the truth, namely, that the
Polish Parteivorstand is a Vorstand without a party. In
Warsaw, the capital of Poland, this Vorstand no longer represents
the Warsaw Committee, but its own fictitious little group. The German
comrades will soon learn about all this in greater detail. Members of the
Russian Social-Democratic Party are aware that there is already a whole
literature about it, and it is futile on Rosa Luxemburg’s part to hush
it up (totzuschweigen) before the International!  

After Radek took his political stand against the so-called
Parteivorstand (without a party), this “Partei”vorstand
cooked up a “trial” against Radek over a “case”—listen to
this!—dating back to
  1 9 0 6!  

That is the crux of the matter, and that is what our
       illustre{2}

Rosa has been trying
   wegzuschwatzen!{3}


Rosa Luxemburg and her “Partei”vorstand are currently conducting an
unprecedentedly fierce fight against their own party’s best workers,
stooping so low as to throw out suspicions of their connection with the
secret police. Rosa Luxemburg and her “Partei”vorstand have lost their
head waging such a war against their political opponents.  

Is it not now clear why, without going into the substance of
the “Radek affair”, I consider it to be my duty to declare that the
substance of the case is political revenge by Rosa Luxemburg and her
“Partei”vorstand?  

Certain methods were described in Russian literature by Turgenev long
ago. One old rascal, he wrote, once gave this wise advice: when doing
something base, see that you shout loudest about the baseness of the acts
you are yourself committing. When robbing the public till, be sure to shout
loudest about the vileness of embezzlement....  

When the Polish “Partei”vorstand stooped to a repetition of Martov’s
methods against Comrade Radek—the “Partei” (v)orstand got Rosa
Luxemburg to raise the greatest possible noise in VorwÃ¤rts about
Martov’s baseness!... Es ist eine alte

    

     Geschichte,{4}

but for us Russian émigrés ist sie leider gar nicht
       “neu”{5}

....



Rosa Luxemburg has been trying to assure her German readers that
Comrade Radek “nie die geringste Rolle gespielt
       hat”,{6}

and so on, and so forth. It is my duty to reply to this elenden
 Altweiberklatsch{7}

and state the precise facts: in 1909 and 1910, Comrade Radek did a
great deal of successful work as a contributor to the Central Organ of the
Social-Democratic Party of Russia. I was one of the editors of the Central
Organ and I cannot let Rosa Luxemburg’s malicious bit of gossip go
unanswered.  

In order to denigrate Comrade Radek, Rosa Luxemburg praises herself
under the name of “polnische
 Wortf\"uhrer”.{8}

She puts out a hint that Comrade Radek’s “taktischen
     Ideen”{9}

are tenuous.  

Let me say right away that I consider this tenuousness, this readiness
to have “peace” with the Russian liquidators, Comrade Radek’s great
sin. But I believe it is more excusable in a collaborator who is not
responsible for C.0. and C.C. policy than in C.C. and
C.O. members. It is patent
     “Intrigenf\"uhrer”,{10}

like Tyszka, who have always played the prevailing role among the notorious
“Polish Wortf\"uhrern” and it is their tenuousness that has done
tremendous damage to the whole party.  

Let me give two examples to substantiate what I say. The Plenary
Meeting of the C.C. of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in
January 1910 unanimously condemned liquidationism. The only
section of the resolution leaving T\"ur und
     Thor{11}

for opportunism (the so-called § 1) was carried on Tyszka’s
initiative. What is Rosa Luxemburg going to say about that? Will she dare
stand up for this § 1 from the standpoint of the “radikale
 Richtung”?{12}
 

When in the spring of 1911 the Bolsheviks withdrew from the so-called
C.C. Bureau Abroad in view of the destruction of the C.C. by the
liquidators, the Poles remained in that institution for months
together with the Bundists and the
Latvians,{24} of whom even (sogar) Plekhanov wrote: “Diese
Parteiinstitution, die zum Werkzeug in den H\"anden einer Gruppe von Leuten
geworden war, die die Partei liquidieren wollten und die daher der Sache
des russischen Proletariats grossen Schaden zuzuf\"ugen drohte, konnte
diesem nur einen Gefallen erweisen: n\"amlich das Zeitliche segnen” (Note:
=

“Tagebuch eines S.D.” 2 Beilage zu N 15, S. 1, zitiert in der Schrift:
“Der Anonymus aus dem VorwÃ¤rts und die Sachlage in der
Soz. Dem. Arb. P. Russlands”; diese Schrift wurde in die Redaktionen aller
s.d. Bl\"atter in Deutschland
      gesandt).{13}


On the strength of these facts, the reader will judge whether there is
a great deal of truth in Rosa Luxemburg’s boastful words to the effect that
the Poles “mit starker Faust die liquidatorische Richtung in Russland
niederzuhalten geholfen
      haben”.{14}


In actual fact, by their intrigues the Poles did much more to
hinder the struggle against this
    “Richtung”{15}

.

Up to now, eight months after the formal expulsion of a
definite group of liquidators from the Party (the magazine
Nasha
Zarya{25} the notorious “polnische Wortf\"uhrer” have been unable
to give a straightforward answer as to whether or not they want
“peace” with this group. It is, of course, not as easy to give a
straightforward answer as to plagiarise the anti-liquidators today and the
liquidators tomorrow, declaring

    

oneself, on the strength of that, to be “superior” to both
“factions”!  

Rosa Luxemburg takes the occasion of the “Radek case” to assure her
German readers that nothing “ausser
     Tr\"ummern”{16}

is left of the “russische
      Partei”.{17}


In response to that I must state the actual facts. It is the Polish
“Partei”vorstand that is the “Tr\"ummer”, because it has not
belonged to the Party for a whole year. For a whole year, it has
not had any organisational ties either with the Party C.C., which was
elected by the January 1912
Conference,{26} or with the so-called “Organising Committee” of the
liquidators.  

The Party of the Russian Social-Democratic proletariat, which has
divested itself of the liquidators and the intriguers of the Polish
“Partei”vorstand, is so far from being Tr\"ummer that it has been
developing with especial success since January 1912. Since some—and at
times, regrettably, influential—comrades in the German party lend an ear
to the frequently biased stories and Klatsch of the Wortf\"uhrer des
polnischen “Partei”vorstandes, who are outside the Party, I shall confine
myself to a brief indication of the facts.  

Legal Marxist newspapers are the only open measure
(Ma&fancyBstab) of the Social-Democrats’ influence in Russia and their
ties with the workers’ masses. Only two “trends”—the Party and
the liquidators—are represented in Russia. All the rest are a
     Schwindel.{18}


In the first half of 1912, the liquidators put out 21 issues of their
paper and the anti-liquidators, 100. In the two months of the second
half-year (July and August) the former had 4, and the latter—6O. In the
eight months (from January to August 1912) the former were able to retort
direct assistance to them from 16 workers’ groups, and the
latter—from
   551.{19}

 

Rosa Luxemburg with her stories about “Tr\"ummer” should try to
refute these facts!  

The stories of the polnische “Partei”vorstand about the Russian Party
are even less credible than their stories about Radek.

The article, written in September 1912, dealt with the state of affairs
in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, which was
split. One section consisted of those who supported the Party’s
Chief. Executive headed by Rosa Luxemburg and J. Tyszka—the so-called

“Zarzadists”. On the whole, the Chief Executive
took an internationalist stand and waged a struggle kit Poland against
nationalism and reformism, but followed an erroneous line on the struggle
within the R.S.D.L.P., taking a conciliatory attitude to the Menshevik
liquidators; it tended to detach itself from the general Party life and
weakened contacts with the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, despite the fact
that the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania was an
autonomous organisation within the R.S.D.L.P. In the struggle against the
mistakes of the Chief Executive, there took shape an opposition represented
by the so-called “Rozlamists”, who relied on the Party’s Warsaw
organisation headed by former members of the Chief Executive I. Hanecki,
A. Malecki and others. Rozlamists were in close contact with the Bolsheviks
and supported their action. Lenin said that in that period the Warsaw
organisation was the strongest and most consistently revolutionary of all
the organisations of the Polish Social-Democrats
(see Lenin’s article “The Split Among the Polish Social-Democrats”,
Vol. 18, pp. 479–83).



The article was aimed against the erroneous line of the Chief
Executive, which objectively inflicted grave harm on the unity of the
working-class movement in Russia as a whole and played into the hands of
the anti-Bolshevik trends in the R.S.D.L.P. While criticising the grave
errors of Rosa Luxemburg and J. Tyszka, Lenin put a great value on their
activity and tried to help them to take a correct stand. Lenin was known to
regard Rosa Luxemburg as an outstanding leader of the Polish, German and
the entire international working-class movement. He wrote later that for
all her mistakes, Rosa Luxemburg was “an eagle” and that “Communists all
over the world cherish her memory”

(see present edition, Vol. 33, p. 210).



The article was written for the Bremer B\"urger-Zeitung which
was under the influence of the Left-wing Social-Democrats; it was
translated into German by Malecki

(see Lenin, Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 48,
Document 72).

The article was not published.

A reference to the charge against Karl Radek that he had committed a
number of unethical acts. This was levelled by a Party court set up by the
Chief Executive of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and
Lithuania. By a decision of the court Radek was expelled from the ranks of
the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania.  


A commission to review the court’s decision was set up in Paris in
early September 1913 on the initiative of the Bureau of the sections of the
Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania abroad (Rozlamists). Lenin
supported the review of the Radek case, for he believed that the charge
against Radek was the outcome of the sharp struggle which the Chief
Executive was waging against the Rozlamists. The commission worked for five
months and arrived at the conclusion that there had been no ground for
committing Radek to trial by a Party court and expelling him from the
Party. It proposed that Radek should be considered a member of the
Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and of the R.S.D.L.P.

A note on “a conference of organisations of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party” appeared in No. 226 of
Volkszeitung{1}

on September 28, but is regrettably based on one-sided and unverified
facts.  

We consider it necessary to point out that the said conference was
actually in no sense a conference of Russian Party organisations. Russian
workers’ centres were not represented at the conference at
all. St. Petersburg was represented by the liquidators from the so-called
promotion
group{3} who do not belong to the Social-Democratic Party and have been
fighting it fiercely in their magazine and
newspaper.{4} Moscow was represented only by a delegate from an
insignificant section of the Party organisation, and he had been given an
imperative mandate to conduct the political line of the Party Conference
held in January 1912. The rest of Russia (Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, Kharkov,
the Volga and Ural regions, the Central Industrial Area, the Don district
and many others) was not represented at all, apart from Krasnoyarsk and
Sevastopol, but it was only from the liquidators’ magazines and the report
about the “conference” that the Party learned of there being any sort of
organisation in either city.  

For a long time it has of course been no secret to the

    

Party that a group of liquidators has been trying to call a conference with
the assistance of the Bund, which has essentially nothing to do with actual
Russian Social-Democratic activity. (For the information of German
readers let us add that when we speak about Russian Party work the
Bund is not included because its sphere of activity is con fined
exclusively to the Jewish proletariat.) However, the real character of this
attempt was so clear that Comrade Plekhanov replied to the invitation to
attend the “conference” that he would not do so not only because he
regarded the “conference” as being one-sided, but also because it was not
attended either by the “Party elements” or by the “anti-Party
elements”. That is exactly what was said in the report published by the
Organising Committee of the liquidators’ conference in September 1912. But
these words of the neutral Comrade Plekhanov are not in
the German report carried in No. 226 of Volkszeitung on September
28 inst. We put it now to every German comrade whether this report can be
considered honest. Even from the groups abroad which gave their formal
consent to the convocation of a conference together with the
liquidators, the former deputy of the Second Duma, Alexinsky, representing
the Vperyod group, left it as a sign of open opposition
to the liquidators’ party conference, because he did not regard it as a
valid party conference.  

It is our duty, however briefly, also to point out the following: In
the six months (from January 1 to June 30, 1912), the anti-liquidators’
newspapers in St. Petersburg, Zvezda and Pravda, united
550 workers’ groups as against the liquidators’ 16. Upon its appearance,
the latter’s new paper,
Luch,{5} was given a hostile reception by the St. Petersburg
workers, who saw it as an attempt to split the Party. The liquidators were
roundly defeated in the election of workers’ representatives to the Duma
(elections to the workers’ curia of the Duma) on September 16 (29). Despite
its use of all the means of advertising, the group which had called this
private conference of liquidators fighting against the Party, failed to
mislead the Russian organisations. It is now making spasmodic efforts
through the same advertising channels to misinform the German comrades, at
least.  
 

We most resolutely protest against this, and point out that the
liquidators’ anonymous information will continue to mislead the German
comrades until they demand that the “informers” should make a public
stand under their own names and with proof in their hands.

Labour Party

This is a reply to the article published in the German
Social-Democratic newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung on
September 28, 1912, on the liquidators’ conference held in Vienna in August
1912, which formalised the anti-Party (so-called August) bloc. The article
tended to mislead the German Social-Democrats, distorted the true character
of the conference and championed the liquidators.  

The article written by Lenin and signed by the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. was
printed in Leipziger Volkszeitung No. 235 of October 9, 1912, and
was soon sent by Lenin to the Secretary of the International Socialist
Bureau Camille Huysmans. The article, Lenin wrote, “will give you an idea
of this ostensibly Social-Democratic conference”

(see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 48,
Document 76).  

Leipziger Volkszeitung—a Social-Democratic daily published
from 1894 to 1933; for a number of years it was edited by Franz Mehring and
Rosa Luxemburg, and was an organ of the Left-wing Social-Democrats. From
1917 to 1922, it was the organ of the

   

German “Independents”; after 1922, the organ of the Right-wing
Social-Democrats.

p. 260





{3}

Promotion groups of Social-Democratic functionaries of the open
working-class movement were set up by the Menshevik liquidators from the
end of 1910 to counteract the illegal Party organisations. These were small
groups of intellectuals which had no ties with the working class.

p. 260





{4}

A reference to the legal organs of the Menshevik liquidators: the
journal Nasha Zarya published in St. Petersburg from 1910 to 1914,
and the newspaper Nevsky Golos published from May to August 1912.

p. 260





{5}

Luch (Ray)—a legal daily of the Menshevik liquidators
published in St. Petersburg from September 16 (29), 1912, to July 5 (18),
1913. Altogether 237 issues were put out, The newspaper was mainly run on
the contributions of liberals. Its ideological leaders were P. B. Axelrod,
F. I. Dan, L. Martov and A. S. Martynov. On the pages of the paper the
liquidators attacked the revolutionary tactics of the Bolsheviks, preached
the opportunist slogan of setting up a so-called “open party”, opposed
revolutionary mass strikes by workers and tried to revise the key
propositions of the Party Programme. Lenin wrote that Luch was
enslaved by liberal policy and said it was an organ of the renegades.

Comrades workers and all citizens of Russia!  

A war of four powers against Turkey has started in the
Balkans.{2} War threatens the whole of Europe. Despite their lying
government denials, Russia and Austria are preparing for war. Italy is
becoming more brazen in her policy of plundering the Turkish lands. The
stock-market panic in Vienna and Berlin, in Paris and London shows that the
capitalists of all Europe see no possibility of preserving European peace.


All Europe wants to take part in the events in the Balkans!  Everyone
favours “reforms” and even “freedom for the Slavs”.  Actually, Russia
wants to snatch a piece of Turkey in Asia and to seize the
Bosporus. Austria has designs on Salonika, Italy on Albania, Britain on
Arabia, and Germany on Anatolia.  

The crisis is mounting. Hundreds of thousands and mil lions of wage
slaves of capital and peasants downtrodden by the serf-owners are going to
the slaughter for the dynastic interests of a handful of crowned brigands,
for the profits of the bourgeoisie in its drive to plunder foreign lands.

 

The Balkan crisis is a link in the chain of events which since the turn
of the century has everywhere been leading to sharper class and
international contradictions, to wars and revolutions. The Russo-Japanese
war, the revolution in Russia, a series of revolutions in Asia, mounting
rivalry and hostility between the European states, the threat to peace over
Morocco, and Italy’s plunderous campaign against Tripoli—such has been
the preparation of the current crisis.  

Wars and all their calamities are produced by capitalism, which keeps
millions of working people in bondage, sharpens the struggle between
nations, and turns the slaves of capital into cannon fodder. A world-wide
socialist army of the revolutionary proletariat is alone capable of putting
an end to this oppression and enslavement of the masses and to these
massacres of slaves in the interests of the slave-owners.  

In Western Europe and America, there is a sharpening struggle by the
socialist proletariat against imperialist bourgeois governments, who are
increasingly inclined to plunge into desperate escapades as they see the
working-class millions inexorably marching to victory. These governments
are preparing war but at the same time are afraid of war in the knowledge
that world-wide war means world wide revolution.  

In Eastern Europe—the Balkans, Austria and Russia—alongside areas
of highly developed capitalism, we find the masses oppressed by feudalism,
absolutism and thousands of medieval relics. Like tens of millions of
peasants in Central Russia, the peasants in Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the
Adriatic coast, are still ground down by the land-owning serf-masters. The
piratical dynasties of the Hapsburgs and the Romanovs support this medieval
oppression and try to stoke up hostility between the peoples in an effort
to strengthen the power of the monarchy and perpetuate the enslavement of a
number of nationalities. In Eastern Europe, the monarchs still share out
the peoples between them, exchange and trade in them, putting together
different nationalities into patchwork states to promote their own dynastic
interests, very much as the landowners under the serf system used to break
up and shuffle the families of their subject peasants!  
 

A federal Balkan republic is the rallying cry that our brother
socialists in the Balkan countries have issued to the masses in their
struggle for self-determination and complete freedom of the peoples, to
clear the way for a broad class struggle for socialism.  

It is the rallying cry of true democrats and real friends of the
working class and we must take it up with especial vigour in face of the
Russian tsarist monarchy, one of the most vicious supporters of reaction
throughout the world.  

The foreign policy of Russian tsarism is an unbroken chain of
unprecedented crimes and acts of violence, and the dirtiest and basest
intrigues against the freedom of nations, against democracy and against the
working class. With the aid of Britain’s “liberal” rulers, tsarism is
crushing and choking Persia; tsarism has been undermining the republic in
China; tsarism is sneaking up to seize the Bosporus and extend “its” own
territory at the expense of Turkey in Asia. The tsarist monarchy was the
gendarme of Europe in the 19th century, when Russian serf-peasant troops
put down the uprising in Hungary. Today, in the 20th century, the tsarist
monarchy is the gendarme of both Europe and Asia.  

Tsar Nicholas the Bloody, who has dispersed the First and Second Dumas,
who has drowned Russia in blood, enslaved Poland and Finland, and is in
alliance with out—and-out reactionaries conducting a policy of stifling
the Jews and all “aliens”, the tsar whose loyal friends shot down the
workers on the Lena and ruined the peasants to the point of starvation all
over Russia—that tsar pretends to be the champion of Slav independence
and freedom!  

Since 1877, the Russian people have learned a thing or two, and they
ate now aware that worse than all the Turks are our “internal
Turks”—the tsar and his servants.  

But the landowners and the bourgeoisie, the Nationalists and the
Octobrists give their utmost support to this vile and provocative lie about
a freedom-loving tsarism. Such papers as Golos
Moskvy{3} and Novoye Vremya are at the head of a whole
army of government newspapers brazenly baiting and badgering Austria, as
though Russian tsarism was not a hundred times more sullied in dirt and
blood than the Hapsburg monarchy.  
 

And it is not only the Right-wing parties, but even the opposition,
liberal bourgeoisie that has been strident in its chauvinistic imperialist
propaganda, scarcely covered up with diplomatically evasive and
hypocritical phrases. Not only the non-party liberal Russkoye
Slovo,{4} but even Rech, the official organ of the Party
of “Constitutional Democrats” (actually counter-revolutionary liberals),
has been zealous in attacking the tsarist Minister Sazonov for his alleged
“tractability”, for his “concessions” to Austria and for inadequate
“protection” of Russia’s “great power” interests. The Cadets have been
blaming the wildest nationalist reactionaries not for their imperialism,
but on the contrary for minimising the weight and the importance of the
“great” idea of the tsarist conquest of Constantinople!!  

For the sake of the vital interests of all the working people, the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party raises its voice in resolute protest
against this base chauvinism and brands it as a betrayal of the cause of
freedom. A country with 30 million starving peasants and with the wildest
arbitrary rule by the authorities, including the shooting of workers in
their hundreds—a country where tens of thousands of fighters for freedom
are being tormented and tortured through hard labour—what such a country
needs above all is liberation from tsarist oppression. The Russian peasant
must think about emancipating himself from the landowning serf-masters and
from the tsarist monarchy, and not allow himself to be diverted from this
vital cause by the false speeches of landowners and merchants about
Russia’s “Slavonic tasks”.  

Imperialist liberalism, desirous of tolerating tsarism, may insist on
“peaceful constitutional” action, promising the people both external
victories and constitutional reforms under a preserved tsarist monarchy,
but the Social-Democratic proletariat indignantly rejects this fraud. The
only thing that can ensure free development for Russia and the whole of
Eastern Europe is the revolutionary over throw of tsarism. Only the victory
of a federal republic in the Balkans, together with the victory of a
republic in Russia, can release hundreds of millions of people from the
calamities of war and the torments of oppression and exploitation in the
so-called “time of peace”.  
 

In the first five months of 1912, more than 500,000 workers in Russia
rose to political strikes, restoring their strength after the most trying
years of the counter-revolution. In some places, sailors and soldiers rose
up in revolt against tsarism. Our call is for revolutionary mass struggle,
for more steadfast, stable and extensive preparation for resolute joint
action by the workers, peasants and the best section of the army! That is
the only salvation for Russia, which has been oppressed and ruined by
tsarism.  

The socialists of the Balkan countries have come out with a sharp
condemnation of the war. The socialists of Italy and Austria and the whole
of Western Europe have given them unanimous support. Let us join in their
protest and unfold our agitation against the tsarist monarchy.  

Down with the tsarist monarchy! Long live the democratic republic of
Russia!  

Long live the federal republic of the Balkans!  

Down with war! Down with capitalism!  

Long live socialism, long live international revolutionary
Social-Democracy!

Notes
 
 



{1}

The manifesto was written by Lenin in early October 1912 and was
published by the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. as a separate leaflet. On October 10 (23),
Lenin sent the manifesto to the Secretary of the International Socialist
Bureau, Camille Huysmans, asking him to convey the text of the document to
the secretaries of the Social-Democratic parties and the press. It was soon
published in German in Leipziger Volkszeitung and
Vorw\"arts, in French in the Belgian newspaper Le Peuple,
and in French, German and English in the Bulletin of the
International Socialist Bureau. It was also published by the Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P. Organisation Abroad and as a special supplement to
No. 28–29 of Sotsial-Demokrat of November 5 (18), 1912.

The First Balkan War (October 1912–May 1913) was
fought between Turkey and the countries of the Balkan alliance—Bulgaria,
Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. It ended in the defeat of Turkey, which
under the London Peace Treaty lost almost all her Balkan possessions. The
Slav regions, Macedonia and Thrace, were liberated; the Albanian people won
national independence. The First Balkan War, despite the fact that the
monarchs and the bourgeoisie of the Balkan countries pursued their own
dynastic and plunderous aims, was on the whole progressive—it marked the
liberation of the Balkan peoples from the Turkish yoke and dealt a blow at
the survivals of the serf system. Lenin said it was “one link in the chain
of world events marking the collapse of the medieval state of affairs in
Asia and Eastern Europe”

(see present edition, Vol. 19, p. 39).

Octobrists, published in Moscow from 1906 to 1915.

Russkoye Slovo (Russian Word)—a daily published in Moscow
from 1895 (the first, pilot issue appeared in 1894); its publisher was
I. D. Sytin. Nominally independent, the paper upheld the interests of the
Russian bourgeoisie from a moderate liberal stand. It had good news
coverage and was Russia’s first paper to send its own correspondents to all
the major cities of Russia and many world capitals.  

In November 1917, the paper was closed down for running slanderous
anti-Soviet reports. From January 1918 it was published under the name of
Novoye Slovo (New Word) and Nashe Slovo (Our Word), and
was finally closed down in July 1918.

As a regular reader of
Pravda,{1} I feel bound to express my deep indignation over
the behaviour of the elector P. Sudakov.  

The elections take place on October 5. Sudakov is not on
Pravda’s list. None the less, Sudakov is returned by the votes of
its supporters—as the results of the elections show. It is also evident
that apart from the votes of Pravda’s supporters (27–31 out of
50) Sudakov also receives a dozen or so votes from someone else, possibly
vacillating voters.  

And so Sudakov himself starts vacillating. The day after the election,
October 6, Pravda carries his report which says, in black and
white, the following: “All those elected,

    

with the exception of Comrade Petrov, belong to the supporters of
Pravda and Zvezda.”  

That’s clear, isn’t it?  

But within 24 hours, Sudakov puts in an appearance in Luch!
Sudakov admits that he has been to Pravda’s editorial office but,
he says, “only as the editorial office of a Social-Democratic
newspaper”!! I wonder if this Sudakov isn’t a babe-in-arms. Who is going
to believe him that he knew nothing about the two Social-Democratic papers?
That he did not know about the liquidators, when he himself under stands
the liquidators?  


   “If I did say,” Sudakov writes in the liquidationist
   Luch, “that I read Pravda and side with it” (please
   note Sudakov declaring that he sides with Pravda!), “it was only
   in the sense” (sic) “that I do in general” (sic) “side” (is that all?)
   “with the Social-Democrats.”  


What is one to make of all this! Here is a man who is aware of the
existence of the two papers, admitting that he did say that he “sided with
Pravda”, and who the next day takes a “senatorial explanation”
to the liquidationist news paper, merely in the sense that he allegedly
sides with the Social-Democrats in general!!  

We are not aware of a more crying instance of spinelessness and
vacillation.  

There have always been “Tushino
turncoats”{2}—deserters from one trend to another—but turncoats
have never had the respect of the workers.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

Pravda (The Truth)—a legal Bolshevik daily; the first issue
was published in St. Petersburg on April 22 (May 5), 1912. The decision to
start a mass working-class daily was adopted by the Sixth (Prague)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.  

It appeared at the time of the fresh revolutionary upsurge, when the
country was swept by a wave of mass political strikes over the Lena
fusillade. The paper was run on funds collected by the workers. It had a
circulation of up to 40,000 copies, with some issues having a printing of
60,000. Lenin said the starting of the workers’ daily was a great historic
undertaking carried out by the St. Petersburg workers. Lenin provided the
ideological direction, almost daily wrote for it, and gave instructions to
its editors. Among its editors and contributors at various periods were
N. N. Baturin, Demyan Bedny, M. I. Kalinin, N. K. Krupskaya,
S. V. Malyshev, L. R. and V. R. Menzhinsky, V. M. Molotov, V. I. Nevsky,
M. S. Olminsky, N. I. Podvoisky, N. G. Poletayev, M. A. Savelyev,
K. N. Samoilova, Y. M. Sverdlov, N. A. Skrypnik, J. V. Stalin,
P. I. Stu&chatka, A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova, and K. S. Yeremeyev. The
Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth Duma took an active part in the
paper. Some of Maxim Gorky’s writings were published in Pravda.


The paper was constantly harassed by the police; it was closed down by
the tsarist government eight times, but continued to appear under other
names: Rabochaya Pravda, Severnaya Pravda, Pravda
Truda, Za Pravdu, Proletarskaya Pravda, Put
Pravdy, Rabochy and Trudovaya Pravda. In these
difficult conditions, the Bolsheviks managed to put out 636 issues in the
course of over two years. On July 8 (21), 1914, the paper was closed down.


It was resumed only after the bourgeois-democratic revolution in
February 1917. From March 5 (18), 1917, Pravda was published as
the organ of the Central Committee and the St. Petersburg Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. Two days after Lenin’s return from abroad, on April 5 (18),
1917, he became a member of the Editorial Board and took over the direction
of the paper. Between July and October 1917, Pravda was harassed
by the counter-revolutionary bourgeois Provisional Government and had
repeatedly to change its name. It was published as Listok Pravdy,
Proletary, Rabochy and

   

Rabochy Put. After the victory of the Great October Socialist
Revolution, in October 27 (November 9), 1917, the Party’s Central Organ
resumed publication under its old name.

In 1608 Russia was invaded by interventionist
troops under Dmitry II the Impostor. The Invaders drew near Moscow and
camped in the village of Tushino where the Impostor formed a government
with its own Court. Some of the Russian boyars deserted alternately to the
Moscow and Tushino governments in an effort to safeguard themselves in the
event of the victory of either side. It was those deserters that were
nicknamed “Tushino turncoats”.

The coup of June 3 (16), 1907, opened the epoch of counter
revolution in Russia. Everyone knows about the judicial and administrative
lawlessness, the persecutions and tortures of those condemned to penal
servitude that crowned this triumph of tsarism.  

The upper sections of the bourgeoisie, terrified by the revolution,
supported the counter-revolutionary gentry.

    

Tsarism was sure that it would find support and assistance among the
counter-revolutionary elements of the bourgeoisie and landowners.  

The electoral law of June 3 (16), 1907, is a specimen of barefaced
rigging. Here are some data characterising it: 

The population is divided into “curias”: landowners first-and
second-category urban dwellers, peasants, Cossacks and workers. Electors,
elected separately by curias (some times not directly, but through
representatives), are grouped by the government into gubernia electoral
assemblies, and the latter elect the deputies to the Duma.  

The law distributes the electors in such a way that in the electoral
assemblies of 28 gubernias (out of 50) only the landowners are assured of a
majority in advance, and in the rest—the electors of the first urban
curia (big capitalists).  

Here is the overall picture: 200,000 gentry have 2,594 electors in the
electoral assemblies of 53 gubernias, that is, 49.4 per cent of the total
number of electors; 500,000 or so capitalists of the first urban curia have
788 electors (15 per cent); almost 8 million townsfolk of the second urban
curia have 590 electors (11.2 per cent); nearly 70 million peasants and
Cossacks have 1,168 electors (22.2 per cent); and nearly 12 million
workers—112 electors (2.1 per cent).  

No wonder this electoral law has produced a “black”
counter-revolutionary Duma—a real “Chambre
introuvable”.{2} What is surprising is that not only bourgeois
liberals, but even Social-Democrats have managed to get their
representatives into such a Duma.  

In the workers’ curia, all electors are Social-Democrats. The
ultra-reactionary gentry, with a majority in the gubernia electorl assemblies, have been forced to let in the
Social-Democrats (in six gubernias, the law stipulates the election of one
deputy from the workers; in other gubernias, the Social-Democrats obtain
mandates through agreements with the liberals).  

The Third Duma was dominated by the Octobrist Party—a party of the
reactionary gentry and big capitalists subservient to tsarism. But even
these “slaves” failed to satisfy the Nicholas II camarilla, this black
band of brigands organising pogroms and attempts on the life of opposition
deputies.  
 

The government, which rigged the elections to get the Octobrists into
the Third Duma, has now falsified the elections to get the more “loyal”
parties—the “Nationalists” and “extreme Rightists”—into the Fourth
Duma.  

The pressure has been unprecedented. The priests have been ordered to
take massive part in the elections and get the Rightists in; the arrests of
the opposition candidates, the fines imposed on the press, the closure of
newspapers, the dropping of suspects from the electoral rolls—all that
was applied with such cynicism that even the Rightists and even the gentry
were impelled to protest.  

As a result, we have an even “blacker” and even more Rightist Duma,
but it is the Octobrists that today turn out to be the defeated party. The
liberal opposition and revolutionary democracy (Social-Democratic workers
and peasant bourgeois democrats) have almost managed to retain the status
quo.  

The latest data on 438 (out of 442) deputies up for election to the
Fourth Duma warrant the following comparison:

Let us add a few words to explain the names and groupings of the
parties: 

Social-Democrats: the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party. Trudoviks: peasant democrats, i.e., revolutionary

    

bourgeois democrats, whose programme includes the expropriation of the
gentry. Cadets: the Constitutional-Democratic Party, actually a
counter-revolutionary, liberal bourgeois party.
Progressists{3}: the same liberals, but slightly more moderate. Poles
and Moslems—the same thing, but on national lines. Altogether the
opposition consists of 25 democrats and 113 liberals, or 138 deputies (142
in the Third Duma).  

Government parties: the Octobrists speak of the constitution rarely and
under their breath; the Nationalists never speak of the constitution. The
Rightists openly favour a return to autocracy and oppose the
constitution. Not only the Octobrists, but even a section of the
Nationalists have been impelled towards the opposition by the election
rigging.  

As for the Social-Democrats, the following have been elected by this
time: 

Six deputies from the workers’ curia are Social-Democrats:
Badayev from St. Petersburg; Malinovsky from Moscow; Samoilov from
Vladimir; Shagov from Kostroma; Muranov from Kharkov; and Petrovsky from
Yekaterinoslav. All six are workers. Then Social-Democrats have also been
returned in three gubernias through agreement between democrats (socialists
and Trudoviks) and liberals against the Rightists. Returned in this manner
were: Khaustov from Ufa; Buryanov from Taurida Gubernia; Tulyakov from the
Don Region. Then three Social-Democrats were returned from the Caucasus:
Chkheidze, Chkhenkeli and Skobelev, the latter being elected by the Russian
population of the Caucasus.  

Two Social-Democrats were returned from Siberia: Rusanov and, from the
Amur Region, Ryslev.  

Let us add, too, that the election of one Social-Democrat from Irkutsk
Gubernia (Siberia) was virtually assured (11 electors out of 20 were
Social-Democrats). However, the governor has declared the election of six
Social-Democrats in the city of Irkutsk invalid. The elections have not yet
been held.  

It is also necessary to add that in Warsaw, as a result of a bloc
between the Bund and the P.P.S., Jagiello, a member of the Polish Socialist
=

Party,{4} was elected deputy.  
 

All these data are preliminary. The full composition of all the groups
of the Fourth Duma, including the Social-Democratic group, will become
known after the Duma opens on November 15 (28).  

Cracow, November 11, 1912

The report was published in Le Peuple No. 325 of November 20,
1912, and was introduced with this editorial note: “Citizen Lenin, a
delegate of the I.S.B., has sent to the Secretariat [of the
I.S.B.—Ed.] the following report about the results of the latest
Russian elections already to hand.”  

In 1963, Lenin’s report was reprinted in the book Correspondance
entre Lénine et Camille Huysmans, 1905–1914. Paris.

{3}

Progressists—a political grouping of the Russian
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie which at the elections to the Dumas and in
them tried to rally elements from the various bourgeois-landowner parties
and groups under the banner of “independents”.  

In November 1912, they formed an independent political party with the
following programme: a moderate constitution wit restricted suffrage, petty
reforms, a responsible ministry, i.e., government responsible to the Duma,
suppression of the revolutionary movement. During the First World War, the
Progressists stepped up their activity, demanding a change of military
command, mobilisation of industry for the needs of the front, and a
“responsible ministry” with the participation of representatives of the
Russian bourgeoisie. After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February
1917, some of the party’s leaders took part in the bourgeois Provisional
Government. Following the October Socialist Revolution, the party carried
on active struggle against the Soviets. Among the leaders of the
Progressists were the well-known Moscow industrialists P. P. Ryabushinsky
and A. I. Konovalov, and the landowner I. N. Yefremov. At various times,
the party published its political organs: the journal Moskovsky
Yezhenedelnik (Moscow Weekly) and the newspapers Stove
(Word), Russkaya Molva (Russian Tidings), and Utro Rossii
(Morning of Russia).

{4}

E. J. Jagiello—a member of the Polish Socialist Party
(P.P.S.); was elected deputy to the Fourth Duma from Warsaw. The Bolsheviks
strongly opposed his admission into the Social-Democratic Duma group
because he had been elected with the support of the

   

bourgeoisie and the P.P.S. and Bund bloc. At the first vote, the group
split up: six deputies (Mensheviks) voted for his admission, and six
(Bolsheviks) against. With the arrival of the Irkutsk deputy, the
Right-wing Menshevik I. N. Mankov, the Mensheviks obtained the majority,
and Jagiello was admitted to the Social-Democratic Duma group. But under
the pressure of the Bolshevik deputies, his rights within the group were
limited: on all internal Party matters, he had voice but no vote.

Novoye Vremya recently reported the final
organisation of separate peasant group in the Fourth Duma. The report says
that it consists of 40 men. The group’s bureau consists of Yevseyev,
Karaulov, Ichas, Firsov and Mershchy.  


   “Karaulov (a Cossack),” wrote Novoye Vremya, “is said to be
   one of the most vigorous men in the new group; he drew public attention by
   his original definition of p arty affiliation in the form which members of
   the Duma are asked to fill in by the magistrate office. In the ‘party
   affiliation’ column Karaulov wrote: ‘I do not belong to any party or
   faction. I am what every man who truly loves his country must be:
   I am a monarchist-democrat.’” 


Can we accept that such a definition of party affiliation is
“original”?  Yes and no. Yes, considering that Karaulov has frankly
expressed what many are afraid to say. No, because in point of fact Deputy
Karaulov’s opinion is notoriously shared by a very considerable number of
peasants and Cossacks.  

Incidentally, Deputy Karaulov believes that “every man who truly loves
his country” must be a democrat. Deputy Karaulov is clearly
mistaken. Let him look at all the Right-wing half or even the Right-wing
two-thirds of the Duma:
can he truly say that among all these “Rightists”—from “Nationalists”
to Octobrists—there is no one “who truly loves his country”?
Karaulov must concede that there probably is.  
 

But it is quite obvious that the Rightists, and the
Nationalists, and the Octobrists (and, honestly speaking, the Cadets as
well) are
  n o t  “democrats”.  

They are all monarchists, that is beyond question, but they are
not democrats. They either do not at all favour a democratic
electoral law, democratic laws on the press, on association and assembly,
democratic distribution of landed property, or talk their way out of the
serious problems of democracy.  

What then is to be done? Is it not clear that the landowners, for
instance, take a different view of “true love for the country”
than the peasants, although both may be monarchists?  

The work of the Fourth Duma will surely make Karaulov and men like him
give serious thought to this.

1. The Editorial Board lacks consistency of Party principle. The
Editorial Board is strongly advised to see to the stricter observance and
implementation of all Party decisions. Its proceedings must be conducted,
on legal lines.  

The C.C. is taking steps to reorganise the Editorial Board.  

2. The Editorial Board has failed to provide the necessary response to
Party life among Social-Democratic workers in St. Petersburg. Reports or
mention of Party resolutions must he unconditionally legal in form.  

3. The Editorial Board must give more attention to explaining the error
and harm of liquidationism in general and of the sermons of Luch
in particular.  
 

4. The Editorial Board must give more attention to campaigning for
subscriptions and collections among the workers.  

5. The Bolshevik section of the deputies must take part in the paper’s
broad editorial collegium and organise systematic and persistent
participation in the literary and economic side of the business.  

6. The Editorial Board must be especially circumspect in its attitude
to its Vperyod contributors to avoid hampering the rapprochement
that has begun and to prevent the adoption of an erroneous principled line.


7. Every effort must be made to reduce publishing costs and to set up a
small governing collegium (running the whole business) on which there must
be at least one representative of the
Six.{2} 

There is need for a similar governing collegium (economic commission)
on which one of the Six must be seated, to handle the economic side of the
business.  

8. Articles which the C.C. considers obligatory for insertion must be
carried immediately (under a code
name).{3} 

9. While strictly maintaining the newspaper’s legal character, it is
necessary to recruit for active participation both in literary work on the
newspaper and in its distribution workers’ societies, leagues, committees,
groups and individuals in St. Petersburg and in the provinces.  

10. Support should be given to the initiative of the group of
St. Petersburg Social-Democrats in the publication of a general trade union
organ of anti-liquidationist orientation, carefully verifying what is being
done on the spot.  

11. Measures must be taken to bring the literary and the economic side
of the newspaper and the
magazine{4} closer together.  

12. The starting of a daily workers’ newspaper in Moscow as a branch of
the St. Petersburg paper must be vigorously pursued. With this end in view,
organisational connections should be established between the Moscow group
and the three deputies of the Moscow Region.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The meeting was held in Cracow from December 26, 1912, to January 1,
1913 (January 8 to 14, 1913). It was attended by V. I. Lenin,
N. K. Krupskaya, J. V. Stalin and the Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth
Duma, A. Y. Badayev, G. I. Petrovsky, N. R. Shagov, among others. The
meeting was also attended by representatives of illegal Party organisations
in St. Petersburg, Moscow Region, the South, the Urals and the Caucasus. It
was chaired by Lenin, who gave the reports on “The Revolutionary Upswing,
the Strikes and the Tasks of the Party” and “On the Attitude to
Liquidationism and on Unity” (the text of the reports has not been
preserved), and drafted and edited all the resolutions. He also wrote the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee’s “Notification” about the meeting

(see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 449–55).



The meeting adopted, decisions on the most important aspects of the
labour movement: the Party’s tasks in connection with the new revolutionary
upsurge and the growth of the strike movement, the build-up of the illegal
organisation, the work of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, the
insurance campaign, the Party press, the national Social-Democratic
organisations, the struggle against liquidationism, and the unity of the
proletarian party

(see present edition, Vol. 15, pp. 456–66).

The decisions were very important in consolidating the Party and its unity,
in extending and strengthening the Party’s ties with the broad masses of
working people and in working out new forms of Party work in the conditions
of a mounting working-class movement. The resolutions of the Cracow meeting
were approved by the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee.

the tsarist government. The printings reached 5,000 copies. Lenin directed
its publication from Paris, and then from

   

Cracow and Poronin. On the eve of the First World War, it was closed down
by the tsarist government. In the autumn of 1917 its publication was
resumed, but only one (double) issue appeared.

Dear Comrades!


On the proposal of the Central Committee, the conference of representatives of
the C.C. and local workers in Russia operating in various branches of
Social-Democratic activity, has discussed your letter of December 28, 1912,
stating your desire to “call a conference and direct debates”.


While expressing gratitude for your attention to our Party affairs, the
conference has unanimously decided to reject your proposal.


We Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats have very great respect for the party
of the German revolutionary proletariat. We want the most fraternal relations to
exist between the Russian and the German Social-Democratic parties. Being
unwilling, therefore, to leave any misunderstanding, we shall try to make a
frank statement to you, dear comrades, of the motives by which we were guided in
rejecting your proposal.


Let us start, for instance, with the aim of your projected conference.


You believe that it should have the aim “to work out a common party
programme and organisational rules,” and invite us to inform you of our
draft for the one and the
other.


But our Party has had a Party programme for a long time. Back in 19Q3, i.e., ten
years ago, our programme was approved by our Party’s Second
Congress. Since then hundreds of thousands, and in the revolutionary years,
millions of proletarians in Russia have proved their loyalty to this programme
by fighting under our Party’s standard. We remain true to this programme
today. We believe its revision to be quite superfluous.


For your information we wish to tell you that up to now not even the
liquidators have demanded any revision of the Party programme—at any rate
they have not done so openly.


Efforts to reach agreement by different groups and groupings concerning a new
programme imply the absence of a party. But the R.S.D.L.P. is
there, and the working class

    

of Russia continues to struggle under its standard. Our Party has faced and
partially still faces some very hard times. But it has not ceased to exist for a
single minute—contrary to the liquidators’ assertions. Only the latter
(i.e., men outside the Party) will find acceptable any negotiations on working
out some new Party programme—apparently for some new party. (What has
been said applies, with slight modifications, to the working out of a new set of
Party rules.)


Furthermore, we are divided from the liquidators by profound differences of
principle—above all on the question of another revolution in Russia. Our
Party (including the pro-Party Mensheviks, with G. V. Plekhanov at
their head) takes the stand that the working class of Russia and its Party must
work for a new revolution in Russia which alone could bring our country true
political freedom. That is precisely what the liquidators deny. All their
tactics are based on the assumption that development in Russia will take a more
or less peaceful constitutional way.


You will easily understand, dear comrades, that from these cardinal
differences inevitably flows a series of contradictions on all questions of
Party work. The liquidators repudiate our present R.S.D.L.P., which can now
exist only illegally (although it is capable of conducting and does
conduct legal Social-Democratic work in many branches). The liquidators
have been trying to wreck our present organisation in the hope of establishing
a legal labour party in present-day Russia. (Let us note here that even the
liberal Cadets have been unable to secure legal status for their party.) Hence
the split, which is entirely and exclusively the work of the liquidators.


Very naturally these disputes, these cardinal differences can be resolved
  o n l y by the conscious Russian workers themselves, only by
our own Russian
Social-Democratic organisations and no one else.


In fact, the Russian workers have already taken a long step in that direction.


The recent election to the Fourth Duma has shown that the Russian proletariat is
overwhelmingly behind the standpoint taken by our old Party with its
revolutionary programme and tactics.

 

All six deputies elected under the law from the workers’ curia are
Bolsheviks.  

These six deputies represent nine-tenths of working-class Russia and
they have openly declared themselves to be opposed to the liquidators.


Russia’s first working-class Social-Democratic daily (the
St. Petersburg Pravda) was founded and is kept going by the
workers themselves, on the pennies of the workers, namely, workers
belonging to the same (Bolshevik) trend. Consequently, the unity of the
vast majority of workers is being created in action, at the grass
roots, in the depths of the, working mass. That is the only unity
that is vital, and it alone will lead to the complete cohesion of the
workers’ forces.  

We shall not conceal from you, comrades, that in the given
circumstances we regard mediation by the German
    Parteivorstand{1}

as being altogether unacceptable. Either for lack of information or for
some other reason, the Vorstand has not displayed impartiality in respect
of the liquidators and us. Let us recall at least these two facts.  

1) The Central Organ of the fraternal German Party
(Vorw\"arts){4} sets aside whole columns for gross attacks by
the liquidators on our January 1912 Party Conference, whereas we are being
denied the opportunity of inserting even a purely factual refutation, which
is a violation of the most elementary duties in respect of us.  

2) During the election campaign, the Vorstand, despite our protests,
gave cash assistance to the liquidators, but denied it to the Central
Committee. The Vorstand gave a subsidy to the Bund, to the Caucasian
Regional
Committee{5} and the Latvians, i.e., the liquidator
O.C.,{6} because everyone knows that it is these three organisations
that mainly constitute the liquidator O.C. And the liquidators used the
German workers’ money to start their publication of a
   Konkurrenzorgan{2}
Luch in St. Petersburg, whose first issue appeared on the very
day of the election and helped to aggravate the split.  

To give cash assistance to one side against the other during a split is
a step absolutely unheard of throughout the International.

    

Having taken such a step, the Vorstand issued a challenge to the supporters
of the January Conference and showed that it was unable to remain
impartial.  

It is with deep regret that we must frankly tell you, comrades, that
the German comrades’ supply of information concerning Russian affairs is
thoroughly defective. This also explains your various proposals,
such as a conference of 12 “trends” (small semi-student groups abroad),
ignoring the organisations in Russia, or the plan to call together five
organisations, etc. This also explains the bare faced attempts on the part
of the liquidators simply to deceive you: for example, their attempt to
obtain money from you on the strength of the allegation that in the summer
of 1912 the Bolsheviks of Kharkov and Moscow united with the
liquidators. Actually, however, it is in Kharkov and Moscow that
Bolsheviks, implacable opponents of liquidationism (deputies Muranov and
Malinovsky), were elected, and they were elected in the struggle
with the latter. This also explains why during the elections you gave cash
aid to the groups (the Bund, P.P.S.,
P.S.D.{7}) which clashed sharpest at the election and which produced
from their midst Jagiello, the only deputy not to be accepted as a
full-fledged member of the Social-Democratic group, and who was admitted by
the slimmest majority of 7 votes to 6.  

It is high time, comrades, to put an end to all this. Instead of
listening to incompetent informants, you must open the pages of your organs
for an objective explanation of the state of affairs in the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party and for its illumination in the light of
principle, namely, for articles signed by responsible spokesmen of the
several Party groups.  

If you want to know about our affairs, you must draw your information
about them from documents and literature, as you do, for instance, in
following the struggle of various trends in Italy, Britain, etc. Otherwise,
you will unwittingly take steps which may frequently be seen by Russian
workers as a quite undeserved affront.

Vorw\"arts—a daily, the Central Organ of the German

the party’s Halle Congress as a continuation of Berliner
Volksblatt, which had been published from 1884, under the name of
Vorw\"arts. Berliner Volksblatt. On its pages, Frederick
Engels carried on a struggle against every sign of opportunism. From the
latter half of the 1890s, after Engels’s death, the paper fell into he
hands of the party’s Right wing and regularly carried articles by
opportunists. It gave a biased view of the struggle against opportunism and
revisionism in the R.S.D.L.P. and supported the Economists, and, after the
Party split up, the Mensheviks. During the years of reaction, the paper
carried Trotsky’s slanderous articles, while refusing Lenin and other
Bolsheviks the opportunity of issuing refutations and giving an objective
assessment of the state of affairs in the Party. During the First World
War, it took a social-chauvinist stand; after the October Socialist
Revolution it conducted anti-Soviet propaganda. Published in Berlin until
1933.

appointed P. B. Axelrod, F. I. Dan and N. V. Ramishvili as delegates to the
Fifth (All-Russia) Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1908. This

A year has passed since the appearance of Pravda’s
first issue. It originated as a workers’ newspaper, created by the
celebrated upswing of the working-class movement in Russia in April and May
1912.  

Pravda has withstood incredible hardships and harassments and
has consolidated its positions (insofar as a workers’ newspaper can be
“consolidated” in modern Russia) through the support of the working
class. Pravda has been more than a workers’ newspaper
in name: any newspaper can adopt a name. Pravda has been
a workers’ newspaper in fact, in its orientation, in its range of
readers from the working mass, and in its content in general, notably the
mass of reports from the workers (1,783 workers’ reports in the first
99 issues; a total of almost 5,000), and, finally, in the
support “Pravda” has been given by workers in general and by
workers’ groups in particular.  

Earlier on we pointed out in Pravda (see Nos. 80 and 103 for
1912){1}

the exceptional importance of the data on support for Pravda
through cash contributions by workers groups. Their importance goes well
beyond the framework of financial assistance, although workers’ financial
assistance is extremely important and necessary to improve the newspaper at
all times.  

But contributions from workers’ groups are equally, if not more,
important in their moral, educational and organisational significance for
all class-conscious workers and for the working class of Russia as a whole.


By developing the habit of giving regular support for
their own working-class newspaper not only through subscriptions
and distribution but also through regular contributions, the workers are
rallied even closer around a newspaper of their own trend, the
workers are organised into some thing ideologically coherent, the
workers verify the progress

    

of their awakening as they read reports about the contributions at a
neighbouring factory or one they know of. It is, therefore, impossible to
over-emphasise the need to extend and develop in every possible way the
custom of regular (it is better to have them small but
regular) contributions and collections by groups of workers for
the workers’ newspaper.  

The published reports showed that before Pravda came out over
4,000 rubles had been collected and sent in through the newspaper
Zvezda by 500 workers’ groups. From the day of our paper’s first
issue up to April 10, contributions totalling 3,932 rubles 42 kopeks were
received, only according to reports published in Pravda. Of them,
79.9 per cent came from proletarians of various categories, 20 per cent
from various groups of intellectuals, and 0.1 per cent from the
peasants. By districts the total is distributed as follows:
St. Petersburg—66.3 per cent (2,605 rubles 81 kopeks), of which only 10
per cent falls to the intelligentsia; Moscow, Vladimir and Kostroma—4.6
per cent, of which contributions from the intelligentsia occur only in
Moscow District (Let us explain at this point that apart from other
reasons, these three districts showed small participation in collections
for Pravda because they also made collections for the Moscow
paper.{2} The money sent only through our newspaper comes to more than
2,000 rubles, of which 70 per cent falls to these three districts and 25
per cent to St. Petersburg District. Once again the St. Petersburg workers
showed their political maturity: they also took an active part in setting
up the Moscow newspaper); the Urals, Siberia, the Baltic Area and
Poland—10.3 per cent; Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav districts—4.4
per cent; elsewhere (Finland, Western Europe, etc.)—14.5 per cent.  

These figures are sufficiently eloquent evidence of who is the owner of
the newspaper, who has kept Pravda going and how intimately it is
connected with the workers’ masses.  

In this context, Pravda’s successes in the first year were
very great. To avoid tiring our readers with a lot of figures, we
shall not give the monthly but the quarterly (that is, three-month) figures
for workers’ group collections for Pravda.

And so we find that in its first year, Pravda met with support
from more than 1,000 groups of workers and laid the foundation for
the workers’ paper of Russia’s main industrial area,
namely, the Moscow Central Area.  

It goes without saying that financial support for
Pravda from a thousand workers’ groups implies all kinds
of support from a much greater number of workers’ groups; it means that
tens of thousands of workers have rallied and united round
Pravda. There is no doubt at all that the number of groups making
cash contributions is only a small fraction of the groups of
Pravda readers and friends, who helped it by their letters and
reports, who helped to circulate the paper, to introduce it among new
workers, new sections of the working people, etc.  

The working class has advanced a whole vanguard of “front-rankers”
who have given a start in the capital to their own, Marxist
workers’ newspaper which is hostile to liberal vacillation, and have
inaugurated a second workers’ newspaper in the heart of industrial
Russia. What the advanced, class-conscious workers have done for
Pravda and for the Moscow workers’ newspaper enables us to pass
unerring judgement on the sum total of the great work done by the workers
for the enlightenment and the organisation of their class. For, after all,
Pravda and the Moscow newspaper are only a part, even if
an important one, of this great cause.  

Encouraged by the success of the first year of the workers’ newspaper,
the advanced workers will join forces in untiring,

    

persistent effort to continue the great cause of enlightening and rallying
ever broader masses of the proletariat round the ideas of Marxism!

The Chinese people have succeeded in overthrowing the old
medieval system and the government supporting it. A republic has been
established in China, and the first parliament of that great Asian
country, which had long gladdened the hearts of the reactionaries of all
nationalities by its immobility and stagnation—the first Chinese
Parliament has been elected, convened and has been sitting for several
weeks.  

In the Lower of the two chambers of the Chinese Parliament, a small
majority belongs to the supporters of Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang Party,
the “Nationalists”—to express this party’s essence in the context of
Russian conditions, it should be called a radical-Narodnik republican
party; a party of democracy. In the Upper Chamber it has a more
considerable majority.  

This party is opposed by smaller moderate or conservative parties with
all sorts of names like “Radicals”, and so on. Actually, all
these parties are parties of reactionaries, namely, bureaucrats,
landowners and reactionary bourgeoisie. They all gravitate to the Chinese
Cadet Y\"uan Shih-k’ai, the provisional President of the Republic, who has
been acting more and more like a dictator. As a Cadet he has been running
true to form: yesterday he was a monarchist; now that revolutionary
democracy has won out, he is a republican; tomorrow he intends to be the
head of state, again a monarchist state, that is, to betray the Republic.


Sun Yat-sen’s party is based on the south of China, which is
the most advanced, the most developed industrially and commercially, and
where the influence of Europe has been greatest.  

Y\"uan Shih-k’ai’s parties are based on the backward north of
China.  
 

The early clashes have so far ended in a victory for Yuan Shih-k’ai: he
has united all the “moderate” (i.e., reactionary) parties, split off a
section of the “Nationalists”, got his man to fill the post of
President of the Lower Chamber of Parliament, and contrary to the
Will of Parliament, secured a loan from “Europe”, i.e., Europe’s
swindling billionaires. The terms of the loan are hard, downright usurious,
with the salt gabelle as security. The loan will put China in pawn to the
most reactionary and plunderous European bourgeoisie, which is prepared to
stamp out the freedom of any nation once profits are involved. The European
capitalists will reap tremendous profits on this loan of almost 250 million
rubles.  

This turns out to be an alliance between reactionary fear of the
European proletariat on the part of the European bourgeoisie and the
reactionary classes and sections of China.  

For Sun Yat-sen’s party the struggle against this alliance is a very
hard one.  

What is this party’s weakness? It lies in the fact that it has
not yet been able sufficiently to involve broad
masses of the Chinese people in the revolution. The proletariat in
China is still very weak—there is therefore no leading class capable of
waging a resolute and conscious struggle to carry the democratic revolution
to its end. The peasantry, lacking a leader in the person of the
proletariat, is terribly downtrodden, passive, ignorant and indifferent to
politics. Despite the revolutionary overthrow of the old and thoroughly
corrupt monarchy, despite the victory of the republic, China has
no universal suffrage! The elections to Parliament had a
qualification: only those who had property valued at about 500 rubles were
entitled to vote! This also shows how little of the really broad
popular mass has yet been drawn into active support of the Chinese
Republic. But without such massive support, without an organised
and steadfast leading class, the Republic cannot be stable.  

Still, despite its leader Sun Yat-sen’s major shortcomings (pensiveness
and indecision, which are due to his lack of proletarian support),
revolutionary democracy in China has done a great deal to awaken the people
and to win freedom and consistently democratic institutions. By

    

drawing ever broader masses of the Chinese peasantry into the movement and
into politics, Sun Yat-sen’s party is becoming (to the extent to Which this
process is taking place) a great factor of progress in Asia and of
mankind’s progress. Whatever defeats it may suffer from political rogues,
adventurers and dictators, who rely on the country’s reactionary forces,
this party’s efforts will not have been in vain.

 ...{1}

The phrase about a struggle waged by “every available means” does not
commit anyone to anything. That is pretty clear. On the contrary, the
phrase seems to have been deliberately chosen to justify the evasiveness of
the liberals. What are “available” means? Is the leader writer in
Luch so childishly naive, is he such a political simpleton that he
is not aware that villainous means are “available” to Russian
liberalism?? He is aware, but he says nothing, thereby putting a nice
make-up on liberalism.  

The liberal millionaire, the industrialist Konovalov, who got into the
Duma through a gross fraud on democracy (a fine villainous means!), has
obtained permission to set up a Russkaya Molva society, with a
capital of half a million rubles, with the aim of coupling the
Cadets with the Octobrists in the “Progressist” newspaper Russkaya
Molva.{2} 

That is a fact, and Luch is aware of it. But together with
these Konovalovs and their hack writers Luch signs a resolution on
a “struggle by every available means”. I put this to any worker and any
thinking peasant: isn’t it clear that this resolution cheats the
people by deliberately using vague words about “availability”, while
the Konovalovs are notoriously known to regard as “available”
only those means which cannot seriously inconvenience Messrs. Purishkevich
& Co.?  
 

That much is clear. All the activity of Messrs. Konovalovs—and, of
course, not the Konovalovs alone, but all the liberals—has provided ample
proof that the only means they regard as available are those which
do not undermine the foundations of the welfare and the
foundations of the privileges of Messrs. Purishkevich & Co.  

There was need to attend the conference to expose for the thousandth
time (we shall never tire of doing this) the fraud and to explain to the
naive, or ignorant, or slow-witted democrats the “gist” (or, if you want
the straight truth, the dirt and the lie) of the word
“availability”.  

This is the basest, the most loathsome, the most corrupt word in the
Russian political vocabulary. From the stand point of grammar it is
ridiculous to say: “I recognise only available means”, for who does not
know that the unavailable is not available? But the whole point is
that the question is not a grammatical, but a political one. The workers do
not regard as available the same things as Konovalov, Milyukov
& Co. do.  

Let me take a negative example. The workers consider unavailable
“means” like declaring Rodzyanko’s speech “constitutional” today, and
to morrow railing about the infamy of the Octobrists (who have remained
true to themselves and to the Purishkeviches from October 17 or even
earlier).  

The workers, a fact I am quite sure of, consider that means and that
method “unavailable” villainy. The Konovalovs and the Milyukovs consider
it “available” “constitutional tactics”.  

Let me now take a positive example.... On second thoughts ... Article
129.... Now, gentlemen, after all you must allow me not to take
any positive example in this article, in this newspaper or in this
magazine! On the other hand, if I had been at the conference, and if the
Konovalovs and the Milyukovs at the conference had promised not to inform
on me, I would have cited a positive historical and statistical example
that would be fine, excellent, vivid and most convincing!... Upon my word,
it is a temptation to describe what is considered available in the sphere
of action in general and in the sphere of the purse, in
particular, by the workers on the one hand, and by the Konovalovs and the
Milyukovs on the other.... But I shall refrain....  
 

One should have attended the conference. It could have offered
more freedom of speech than “certain other places”. There the democrats
should have been invited to speak out on the harm of reformism—this would
have been opportune from the standpoint of the question that has been
raised. There would have been two resolutions: the democratic and
the liberal, one “unavailable” to the liberals (but available to the
workers and the class-conscious petty bourgeois, or at least to a section
of them) and the other “available” to the Konovalovs. The public would
have read both resolutions or would have heard about both of them and would
have given them thought. It would have thoroughly scrutinised
them. It would have used its brains. People would have started to make
comparisons.  

And surely within a short while, the democracy which believes liberal
villainy “unavailable” and regards something quite different as available
would have started to split away from the section of democracy
which is captivated by liberal catchwords and empty phrases. That, too,
would have been “joint action”—but not in the spirit of common talk
with the liberals concerning the limits of what is “available” to
liberalism.  

Yes, indeed, the newspaper Luch is being run by loathsome
liberals, but if it carries a few more useful leaders like the one in
No. 189, the workers will finally find out these “evil pastors”. Carry
on, gentlemen, and Godspeed!

Novoye Vremya, a newspaper of the Black-Hundred
landowners, reports some interesting discussions among landowners in Poland
and in the frontier areas of Russia in general over the migration of
agricultural workers to Germany and other European countries in search of
employment.  
 

This migration has been rapidly growing. In 1901, some 218,000 persons
a year were estimated to have migrated. In 1911, the figure was set at
740,000, more than three times the 1901 figure. In 1912, as many as 800,000
must have left.  

Let us note that apart from Polish peasants and workers, Russian
workers from the centre of Russia have been also leaving for Germany. “Now
one very often meets men from Tula, Orel and Ryazan on the border and
beyond.” The issue of free ten-month foreign passports for
workers going to do agricultural work has intensified this movement.  

What is the cause? It is that the Russian peasants are being
increasingly ruined and it is ever harder to earn a living in Russia,
because of the general stagnation of economic life, which is depressed by
the serf-owners and lawlessness. Wages in Russia are being kept down at the
low serf level.  

In Russia, the annual agricultural wage averages 62 rubles; add to this
46 rubles’ worth of food a year and you get wages totalling 108 rubles a
year. In Germany, however, wages average 180 rubles a year, i.e.,
just under twice as much!! (In Britain, let us note in
parenthesis, agricultural labourer’s wages come to 300 rubles a year, and
in America, to 500 rubles.)  

It is natural, therefore, that hundreds of thousands of
workers are fleeing from lawless, starving and impoverished Russia to find
employment in Germany, and even beyond it—in Denmark, Switzerland and
France. There the workers find out about a higher level of culture, much
better cultivation of the soil, incomparably higher crop yields and, what
is most important, political freedom, freedom for the labour press and
labour organisations.  

And so, we find the landowning gentlemen debating between themselves:
some say that the landowner will benefit from this massive training of our
workers in better methods of agriculture. Others wax indignant over the
fact that the migration of workers tends to raise wages in the places which
they leave.  

In Russia, generally speaking—and in Russian legislation in
particular—the opinion of the latter prevails, and they would
like to see the peasants “settled” (i.e., tied to the land), submissive
(without any prospect of moving), downtrodden

    

and barbaric (to prevent them from seeing how to improve their living
conditions and how much better off workers in other countries are).  

Fortunately, these landowning serf-masters, however hard they may try
to break and distort Russian life, no longer have the power to stem the
tide of world-wide capitalism, which is uprooting the Russian muzhik as
well from his godforsaken hole.

 ...{1}

Mr. Potresov quotes (rather distorts) G. V. Plekhanov’s article which
appeared in August of 1905. At the time, there was a complete and formal
split between the Bolsheviks, who united at the Third Congress of the
Social-Democratic Party (London, May 1905), and the Mensheviks (a
“conference” at Geneva at the same
time).{2} The Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks had their own separate
press organs both in 1905 and in the spring of 1906.  

These are all generally known historical facts, and the rider,
Mr. Potresov, speculates on their being forgotten.  

He has to keep silent about them because they expose the
rider’s impudence!  

Neither of the then existing two Social-Democratic
parties (and at the time Plekhanov was out of touch with both of them) had
any party decision concerning the non-Party significance of
G. V. Plekhanov’s article, or its liquidationism its destruction or denial
of the Party!  

That tells the whole story, Mr. Dodging and Hiding Liberal Rider.  

Liquidationism is a trend condemned by formal Party
decisions in December 1908 and again in January 1910 (unanimously
by all trends).  
 

No conference (or any other institution) of the Party
ever “read” any liquidationism into Plekhanov’s
article. That tells the whole story. Mr. A. N. Potresov clutches
at an old article and presents a sheaf of quotations in order to
hush up the fact that the whole Party condemned him,
Potresov, his liquidationist trend.  

Riders from among the liberal intelligentsia, like Mr. Potresov, are
full of a grand, aristocratic contempt for working-class party
decisions. These riders ignore party decisions!  

And the working-class party ignores the liberal Luch and the
liberal Mr. Potresov, who “reads” liquidationism into Plekhanov’s old
articles, as Mr. V. Chernov used to “read” Narodism into Liebknecht.


Mr. Potresov is pathetic and ridiculous in his vain efforts to talk his
way out of the fact that liquidationism has been condemned by the Party.


It is only idle talk on the part of Mr. Potresov and Luch
about taking Plekhanov to court, it is only an effort to fool the
reader. They are well aware that everyone will
  b l a m e  them and will laugh at their vain efforts to accuse
Plekhanov.

{2}

The Geneva conference of Mensheviks was held simultaneously
with the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in April 1905. In view of the
small number of participants (only delegates from nine committees) the
Mensheviks declared it to be a conference of Party functionaries.  

Its decisions showed that the Mensheviks did not set themselves the
task of carrying forward the revolution. They denied the hegemony of the
proletariat in the revolution and the policy of alliance between the
proletariat and the peasantry. They believed the liberal bourgeoisie to be
the leader in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, which was to take over
after the revolution won out. The Mensheviks denied the need for a
provisional revolutionary government and participation of Social-Democrats
in it. In its decisions on an armed uprising, the conference failed to set
out the practical tasks facing the proletariat. The Mensheviks believed
that the proletarian party should not take part in preparing the uprising
or ear of scaring off the bourgeoisie. The conference came out against
Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary
government. It did not set the task of organising revolutionary peasant
committees to seize the landed estates, leaving the solution of the
agrarian problem to a future Constituent Assembly. The conference decisions
on the organisational question, expressed in the “organisational Rules”,
dragged the Party back from the Second Congress to organisational
fragmentation and clannishness. Lenin exposed the opportunist character of
these decisions and subjected them to withering criticism in his article
“A Third Step Back”, his work Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the
Democratic Revolution, and in the “Preface to the Pamphlet
Workers on the Spill in the Party”

(see present edition, Vol. 8, pp. 544–54, Vol. 9, pp. 15–140 and
163–68).

The British labour press is continuing its interesting and
instructive campaign of exposure revealing how the syndicates of
internationally associated capitalists are pushing the nations into war.


Take Nobel’s dynamite trust (or syndicate). Its capital comes
to the tidy sum of 30 million rubles. Last year, it had a net profit of
3.3 million rubles. Eleven per cent in net profit, not bad, eh?  

In their annual report, the noble dealers in destructive materials
modestly explain their success in this short phrase:
“This year there was a high demand for military supplies.”  
 

Is it surprising? The capitalist press and the political leaders
serving the capitalists have been shouting about war, and clamouring for
more armaments—that is so profitable for the industrialists manufacturing
military supplies!  

But who are they, these industrialists?  

They are the associated capitalists of all nations, the
brothers of ministers, members of parliament and so on!  

Among the shareholders of the “dynamite” trust (which is a
shareholder, if not an owner, of four dynamite plants in Germany)
we come across the following names: 

German army: General von M\"uhlburg, Major Baron von Fritsch, etc.;


British army: General J. Donald, Colonel Noel Findlay, etc.; 

French army: Colonel Fran&ctailois Laffargue; 

Lord Glenconner, brother of Mrs. Asquith, the British Prime
Minister’s wife, Sir North, a minister, Harold Tennant, M. P.,
Deutsche Bank, Hannover Bank, etc.  

The leaders of the national parties in various parliaments who
shout about the “might of the state” and about “patriotism” (vide the motion formulas of the Cadets, Progressists and
Octobrists in the Fourth
Duma!{1}) realise this patriotism by arming France against Germany,
Germany against Britain, etc. They are all such ardent patriots. They are
all so concerned, oh, so concerned about the “might of the state”—their
own, of course—against the enemy.  

And so they sit alongside these “enemies” on the boards and at the
meetings of shareholders of the dynamite and other trusts (syndicates),
raking in millions of rubles in net profits and pushing—each one his
“own” nation—into war against other nations.

## Cheap Meat for the “People”

What a sensation! A most vital need of the workers is being
satisfied!  Cheap meat for the people—where? what? how?  

Russkoye Slovo reports that the city slaughter-house in Moscow
has opened a “Freibank”, i.e., a shop for the sale

    

of cheap meat which has been rendered harmless and certified as relatively
fit for use.  

Cheap meat is a good thing. But what is the meaning of “rendered
harmless”, “relatively fit for use” (consequently, there would
be equal reason to say “relatively unfit for use”!)?  Here is
what it means: 

When animals are put up for sale, they are examined by veterinary
inspectors. Sick ones are rejected. No permission is given to slaughter
them, because their use for food threatens to infect humans with various
diseases. Most rejected animals are tubercular and measly (worm-infected).


Of the total of about 450,000 head of cattle going through the Moscow
slaughter-house almost 30,000 are rejected as suspect.  

And so this suspect measly and tubercular cattle is rendered harmless
by boiling in a special chamber under the supervision of a veterinary
surgeon for about three hours. This boiling kills off the worms and the
tubercular bacilli.  

Well, apparently all, or almost all, die off or nearly die off! This
yields cheap boiled meat that has been rendered harmless.  

The people say, according to a comment in Russkoye Slovo, that
“this meat won’t kill you, but it may give you TB or stomach trouble,
because, after all, the brutes were ailing.”  

The demand for this meat is heavy. Workers from the city itself go
there and queue up for a long time. The morning queues consist mostly of
women, housewives; the day queues, of workers, mainly builders.  

The boiled meat that has been rendered harmless and that won’t kill you
but will give you stomach trouble is just right for the people. The people
cannot afford real meat.  

It is said that the more painstaking the veterinary super vision, the
more meat is rejected. “So”, Russkoye Slovo concludes, “the
population have a twofold interest in thorough supervision: the middle
classes want sound meat delivered from, the slaughter-house; the poor, more
cattle rejected and the Freibank kept well supplied with meat.”  

We certainly live in very civilised and philanthropic times: we have
learned to make the population take a “twofold interest”. And the
“freedom” for cheap meat

    

is remarkable: after all, “Freibank” in German means “free shop”.  

Civilisation, freedom, cheap products, revival of trade—everything is
for the people! Whenever you see an advertisement: “People’s Quarters
Society”—you can be sure that the cellar or garret will be cheap and
under medical supervision: it won’t kill you of course, but you will
get TB.  

Whenever you see a signboard: “People’s Dining-Hall”—don’t hesitate
to go in. You will be served cheap boiled meat which has gone through the
slaughter-house under supervision, and which has not gone through the
slaughter house without supervision.  

Whenever you see a signboard: “People’s Library”—you can afford to
exult. There you will find cheap or even free pamphlets issued by the Union
of the Russian People or the All-Russia Nationalist Club, under the medical
supervision of the spiritual censorship.  

It is being said that a “Freibank” is soon to be opened for the sale
of “people’s bread”—made of grass, which is boiled, rendered harmless
and baked under veterinary, sorry, I mean medical supervision.  

Civilisation, freedom, cheap products, revival of trade—everything is
for the people! And the population will find itself with a growing twofold
interest: the rich, to have their meat sound, and the poor, to have the
“Freibank” well stocked with meat relatively fit for use.

The legal Bolshevik Priboi Publishers was set up in St. Petersburg in
early 1913 and operated under the direction of the Party’s Central
Committee. It responded to various questions of the working-class
movement. Emerging during the “insurance campaign” it issued many
publications on workers’ social insurance. Subsequently, on instructions
from the Party’s C.C., it devoted much attention to the issue of popular
agitation and propaganda pamphlets on socio-political and Party
questions. In view of the intensified persecution of the workers’ press by
the tsarist government at the start of the First World War, Priboi had to
cease its activity and resumed it only in March 1917. In 1918, it was
integrated with Kommunist Publishers, which had been set up as a merger of
several publishing houses (Volna, Zhizn i Znaniye, etc.).

The current political situation in Russia is of especial
interest. The negotiations between the Cadets, the Progressists and the
Octobrists on common “opposition” tactics in the Duma, on the one hand,
and the working-class movement, on the other, testify not only to a
“revival”, but to something else as well.  

One of the highly instructive documents of our interesting period is
the appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Union of October
Seventeen to party members, urging them (according to Rech) to
“discard their apathy and set about working with vigour”.  

According to the Octobrist C.C., “now that the revolutionary forces
are once again coming into motion, evidence of which is incidentally
provided by the strikes, all high-minded

    

citizens sincerely desirous of the state’s progressive development should
join the Union of October Seventeen, thereby increasing its membership and
enhancing its prestige”.  

The work of the Octobrists, their C.C. believes, should “paralyse the
influence of the destructive elements who are again raising their voice in
importunate and vociferous calls for another revolution in Russia’s
political and social system. The Central Committee gives a reminder of the
sacrifices the state and society will have to suffer, if high-minded men
now sit back and shun social activity. The Central Committee is sure that
millions of loyal Russian citizens will not allow a handful of
revolutionaries to ruin Russia”.  

That is how Rech (No. 275) reports the contents of the
interesting appeal from the Octobrist C.C., without apparently finding any
departures in it from normal Octobrist policy.  

Let us examine the appeal of the Octobrist C.C. as a document
characterising the history of our time. The Octobrists are invited to
“discard apathy”. This means that there has been apathy up to now,
doesn’t it? When the forces of reaction were triumphant, the Octobrists
were apathetic. When it looked as if the forces of reaction would
be adequate to maintain “order”—the Octobrists were satisfied and saw
no need to “set about working”. When the forces of reaction have proved
to be inadequate (the forces opposed to the reactionaries “are once again
coming into motion”)—then... then the Octobrists vigorously set about
the business of helping reaction.  

Indeed, is it not helping reaction for an influential Duma group to
start bashing the “importunate and vociferous” Left-wingers, their desire
to “ruin Russia”? Just think:
a “handful” only, and they threaten to “ruin Russia”! The Left-wingers,
whose newspapers (numbering at least a dozen all over Russia) are being
confiscated almost daily, are remarkable, please note, for their
“importunity and vociferousness”! And that, you will note, is a
word-for-word repetition of the truly importunate and vociferous phrases
which the reader will find any day in the Black-Hundred government press.


This gives us a picture of what the preaching of “progressive” ideas
“in the spirit of the October 17 Manifesto” has

    

actually come to. As soon as the working-class movement gained in strength
and brought about a general revival in social life, our bourgeois
“Progressists” at once bared their teeth, not against reaction,
but against the working-class movement.  

Russia is again facing a balance of forces, similar to the one in
evidence eight or nine years ago, but on an extended scale, over a wider
field. At that time, the Octobrists, the Progressists and the Cadets were
still undifferentiated and existed together as a united and ostensibly
“leading society”. It would appear that we now have three
developed political parties of the bourgeoisie—the Octobrists, the
Progressists and the Cadets—who have gone through and tried themselves
out in three Dumas and in the eventful years from 1906 to 1912. There is an
ideal division of labour between them: the Octobrists declare
outright war on the Left, and do so in the resolute Black-Hundred spirit;
the Progressists were in agreement with the Octobrists yesterday,
and today are doing the same thing, promising to pursue this respectable
occupation for a long time; the Cadets, for their part, have also long been
in “agreement” with the Progressists, friends of the Octobrists, assuring
the people of their democratism, you will pardon the expression.  

If the working-class movement eight years ago ignored all the Octobrist
and the Cadet overt and covert betrayals and vacillations, there is good
reason to believe that the workers have not grown more stupid
since then.

The 50th anniversary of Moscow’s liberal newspaper has
evoked torrents of laudatory speeches from Russian liberals of every
stripe. That is natural, legitimate and consistent. Liberals can be
expected to celebrate the jubilee of the liberal newspaper. Russkiye
Vedomosti{1} has been no worse than other liberal newspapers, and
in some respects (as in

    

the abundance of scientific material) it has certainly been above
the liberal average.  

But when the rhetoricians of liberalism, Messrs. Kovalevsky, Milyukov,
Manuilov, Bunin and their like, praise “Russkiye Vedomosti” on behalf
of democracy and from an ostensibly democratic standpoint, that is a
flagrant lie and it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.  

Distinguished and notable liberals! You all swear that you stand for
political freedom. But you refuse to understand one simple fact, namely,
that a liberal society in Russia which allows counter-revolutionary
statements by liberals to go unchallenged, does not deserve political
freedom and will never get it.  

You are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Russkiye
Vedomosti, aren’t you? That’s fine. In that case, do not hide the
truth, do not forget that Russkiye Vedomosti was one of the
first liberal newspapers to trip up the first serious and deep-going mass
movement in Russia, whose aim was to attain political freedom.  

That was in the summer of 1905. The leading light of liberal
science and liberal publicism, Mr. Professor Vinogradov the historian, then
contributed to Russkiye Vedomosti a remarkable, unforgettable, and
memorable “historic” article. His main idea was as follows: let’s hope
our movement does not go beyond the German one of 1848–49, otherwise the
Prussian watchman will have to restore order over here.  

That’s the kind of thing Russkiye Vedomosti, organ of the
liberals, printed in the summer of 1905!!  

Let everyone in Russia who wants to gain a reputation for being a
democrat ponder this historical fact. History has proved—and its proof is
irrefutable—that the movement in the autumn of 1905 was weak and
inadequate, while a famous liberal found it much too strong in the
summer of 1905, and put spokes in its wheels.  

The fact is there. It is incontrovertible. This liberal and all his
fellows, all his—you will pardon me the expression—fellow-politicians
among the liberals bear the moral and political blame for
the Jewish pogroms in the autumn of 1905. For, incidentally, the pogromists
drew for strength and impudence on precisely this “Vinogradov”-type mood
of liberal society.  
 

The “Vinogradov”-type liberals have the government they
fully deserve. The “Vinogradov” liberal writing in Russkiye
Vedomosti, and Purishkevich, the collective Purishkevich, are only two
sides of the same medal, they are interconnected and interdependent
phenomena.  

There can be no political freedom in Russia until she
has (or because she lacks) mass democracy with a clear understanding of the
total short-sightedness, absurdity and vileness of the “Vinogradov”-type
liberalism of Russkiye Vedomosti.

{1}

Russkiye Vedomosti (Russian Recorder)—a newspaper published
in Moscow from 1863, expressing the views of the moderate liberal
intelligentsia. In the 1880s and 1890s, contributors to the paper included
writers from the democratic camp (V. G. Korolenko, M. Y. Saltykov-Shchedrin
and G. I. Uspensky, among others); it also carried the works of the liberal
Narodniks. From 1905, the paper was the organ of the Right wing of the
Cadet Party. Lenin said that the paper was a unique combination of
“Right Cadetism and Narodnik overtones”

(see present edition, Vol. 19, p. 135).

In 1918, the newspaper was closed down along with the other counter
revolutionary newspapers.

Having examined the liquidators’ charge in their Novaya
Rabochaya Gazeta against insurance worker X, and having obtained all
the testimonials from the Editorial Board of the liquidators’ newspaper and
from the Editorial Board of Za Pravdu, which on October 17
published the decision of a commission from five Marxist
institutions, we, the board of such and such a league or society, find this
decision correct and the liquidators’ campaign slanderous.  

We urge workers, in order to safeguard their organisation from ruin, to
boycott the slanderers, unless they make a firm and public retraction of
their slanders.

A reference to B. G. Dansky (K. A. Komarovsky). He joined the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1911, contributed articles to Zvezda and
Pravda and took p art in the insurance movement; in 1913 and 1914,
he was on the Editorial Board of the Bolshevik journal Voprosy
Strakhovaniya. In order to discredit the Bolsheviks, the liquidators
accused Dansky of writing for the bourgeois press. A Party commission
consisting of representatives of the Editorial Boards of the news paper
Za Pravda and the journals Prosveshcheniye and
Voprosy Strakhovaniya, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group
in the Duma, and Priboi Publishers examined the facts and established that
after joining the Bolshevik Party Dansky had ceased writing for the
bourgeois press; accordingly, it declared him to be an honest Party member,
and the liquidators’ charges, libellous. Lenin also wrote about the case
later, in the report of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee at the Brussels
Conference

(see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 524).

Both Social-Democratic newspapers in St. Petersburg, which express the
views of the liquidators and the pro-Party men, carry statements by
workers’ groups from all

    

over Russia. In these statements, the workers define their attitude to the
two Social-Democratic Duma groups: 1) the Social-Democratic group (7
deputies + Jagiello), and 2) the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group—6
Social-Democratic workers’ deputies.  

We are now in a position to sum up the exact results of the workers’
decisions, according to the data in both news papers, for a whole month,
from October 20 to November 20, old style. 

The most exact workers’ statements, never once questioned by either
side, are the resolutions with a definite number of
s i g n a t u r e s.  The overall result, for the whole of Russia
(not only the Caucasus, but also the Bund and the Latvians have a special
representation on the International Socialist Bureau), is: 4,850 for the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour group (6 deputies) and 2,539 for the
Social-Democratic group (7 deputies + Jagiello).  

Trade unions, as represented by their boards (for police reasons the
names of the ,trade unions in Russia are not published) = 9 unions with
13,500 members, for the 6 deputies; and one union with an unspecified
membership, for the 7 deputies.

 Outline of a Report to Local Organisations 

December 12 

General theme—events of the strike movement and Party life since the
summer of 1913. Conference resolutions. In particular, the following points
are brought out: 

1. A general strike on January 9, 1914. Conference decision. Necessity
of the strike. Its slogans (democratic republic,

    

8–hour working day, confiscation of landed estates). Intensified
preparations for the strike.  

2. Insurance campaign. More extensive circulation of the
magazine Voprosy
Strakhovaniya.{2}—Formation of Party cells inside all
societies and all boards. Getting our own, Party, majority on the
boards (also in trade unions, clubs, etc., etc.).  

3. The Six and the Seven. The main reasons for the
split:
(a) liquidationism=destruction of the Party. Struggle over
that. The Seven incline to liquidationism; (b) the Seven
do not recognise Party decisions; (c) the majority of the
Party has been proved to back the Six. Main figures from
Pravda. Issues with material on the question of the split
should he on hand.  (Resolutions for the Six should be
  p r e s s e d  forward.)  

4. Party congress. Necessity of it. Participation in it of all
illegal Party cells. Its preparation:
m o n e y  is the main thing. Collection of fund for
congress (mainly through the deputies). The task for each group or union of
groups is by the spring to collect double the amount of expenses
(expenses per delegate—150 rubles. Each group or union of adjacent groups
must collect 300 rubles).  

5. The need to develop ties—to strengthen them (teaching
correspondence with the St. Petersburg Bureau and the Bureau Abroad). The
correspondence is weak: that is why transport is poor. There must
be agents everywhere.  

6. A review of the main points from the resolutions of the
conference. For instance, on the national question: (a) struggle against
every brand of nationalism, even the refined one (cultural-national
autonomy); (b) unity of workers of all nationalities; (c) struggle
against Great-Russian Black-Hundred nationalism. (Idem briefly
about the other resolutions.)  

7. Legal and illegal press. Increase collections. The legal press will
inevitably go down: concentrate efforts on creating an illegal one
(see “Announcement”, pp. 9–10 especially).  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

For reasons of secrecy this was called a summer conference but actually
it was held from September 23 to October 1 (October 6 to 14), 1913, in the
village of Poronin, near Cracow, where Lenin then lived. On its agenda were
the following questions: 1) reports from the localities, report on the work
of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania, report on the work of the
C.C. elected

   

at the Prague Conference; 2) the tasks of agitation at the present moment;
3) organisational question and the Party congress; 4) strike movement; 5)
Party press; 6) Social-Democratic work in the Duma; 7) Social-Democratic
Duma group; 8) work in legal societies; 9) national question; 10)
Narodniks; 11) the forthcoming International Socialist Congress (in
Vienna). Lenin directed the Conference. He delivered the opening speech,
gave the report on the work of the Central Committee, the report on the
national question, and on the forthcoming International Socialist Congress
in Vienna. He also spoke on almost all the questions of the agenda, kept a
record of speeches by delegates from local Party organisations, motioned
proposals, drafted and edited resolutions. The text of the report on the
work of the C.C. has not been discovered. A brief summary of some points
from the report is given in A. Y. Badayev’s reminiscences.  

Two resolutions, written by Lenin, were adopted on the C.C. report and
the reports from the localities: “The Tasks of Agitation in the Present
Situation” and “On the Organisational Question and on the Party
Congress”, which determined the Party’s tasks and the main forms of Party
work in the new historical conditions. One of the main questions at the
Conference was the national question, which at the time was among the most
prominent in Russia’s social life. In his report on the national question,
Lenin emphasised that the struggle against national oppression was
indissolubly bound up with the struggle against tsarism, for freedom and
democracy. The Conference, on the strength of the Party Programme,
resolutely rejected the opportunist demand of the Mensheviks and the
Bundists for “cultural-national autonomy” and adopted the propositions on
the national question worked out by Lenin. He regarded the resolution on
the national question as a declaration of the Party Programme on this
issue. The Conference decided to include the question of a national
programme on the agenda of the next Party congress.  

In its resolution on the Social-Democratic Duma group, the Conference
demanded equality for the Bolshevik and the Menshevik sections and
resolutely condemned the actions of the Menshevik section, which made use
of its chance majority of one vote and was violating the elementary rights
of the Bolshevik deputies, who represented the vast majority of Russia’s
workers. On instructions from Lenin and the C.C. of the Bolshevik Party,
the Bolshevik deputies left the joint Social-Democratic group in the Duma
in October 1913 and act up their own Bolshevik group (the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group).  

In his report on the International Socialist Congress, which was to be
held in Vienna in 1914, Lenin proposed that as many delegates as possible
should be sent from the illegal and legal organisations, for it was
intended to hold a Party congress simultaneously with the International
Socialist Congress.  

Lenin delivered the summing-up speech. In view of the importance of the
questions discussed and the decisions adopted, the Poronin Conference had
the significance of a Party conference.

   

The minutes of the Conference have not been found. The announcement of the
Conference and the resolutions it adopted were published in a separate
pamphlet abroad as a Central Committee publication (Izveshcheniye i
rezolutsii letnego 1913 goda soveshchaniya Tsentralnogo Komiteta
R.S.D.R.P. partiinymi rabotnikami.  (Announcement and Resolutions of
the Conference held by the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. and Party
functionaries in the Summer of 1913). For reasons of secrecy, some of the
resolutions were published in part: point 6 of the resolution on the strike
movement and points 1–5 on the Party press were omitted. The full text of
the resolutions was printed in an illegal hectographed publication. There
are police department records of the Conference, of which the details were
supplied by the provocateurs Malinovsky and Lobov.

About the Conference see present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 417–31.



Lenin sent an outline of the report to be made in the localities to
St. Petersburg on November 29 (December 12), 1913. The outline was drawn up
for the Bolshevik deputies of the Fourth Duma, as a guide for their reports
about the Conference to be made to local Party workers during the Christmas
recess.

Voprosy Strakhovaniya (Problems of Insurance)—a legal
Bolshevik journal published in St. Petersburg from October 1913 to March
1918 with interruptions. It waged a struggle not only for workers’
insurance but also for Bolshevik “uncurtailed slogans”—an eight-hour
working day, confiscation of landed estates and a democratic
republic. Among those who took part in the journal were prominent leaders
of the insurance campaign, the Bolsheviks N. A. Skrypnik,
P. I. Stu&chatka, A. N. Vinokurov and N. M. Shvernik.

A number of groups abroad, big, small and tiny, are making
a lot of noise over the forthcoming sitting of the International Socialist
Bureau on December 1
(14).{1} By the time Tuesday’s edition is out there will perhaps be
some news, by cable, of the Bureau’s decision. I believe it to be my duty,
therefore, to describe the state of affairs so as to prevent any false
rumours and to make it possible to adopt the right tone at once.  

The small and tiny groups abroad, who have no support in Russia (like
Rosa Luxemburg and the Tyszka people, or Charles Rappoport, who recently
wrote in a small French paper in the same spirit, or Alexinsky and the
Vperyod group in Paris, etc., etc.), all these little groups are
straining hard to have the Bureau take a vote for “unity”.  

Of course, we too want unity!! The efforts of the little groups are a
pathetic move to protect the liquidators. This move of theirs will fail:
they will make a fuss and that’s as far as it will go.  

What decision will the Bureau take? That is, of course, something we
don’t know. But we were told by a very prominent member (or even a
group of members) that
f o r  f o r m a l  r e a s o n s  the idea is to admit the
liquidator O.C.,
i n s t e a d  o f  Plekhanov, and from the Duma group,
o n l y  the Seven, or rather the Eight. These formal reasons are
as follows: the parliamentary groups in every country do not
represent the parties, but only themselves; let us say there are
eight Socialist-Revolutionaries and seven Social-Democrats—then
only the eight S.R.s. are sent in. Since
that is so (that will be verified), nothing can, of course, be done
f o r  t h e  t i m e  b e i n g.  Let the liquidators throw
out Plekhanov—we shall see whether this is going to do them any
good!!! I am Sure that it wil not.


That is why I strongly suggest that there should be no nervousness or
excitement, either over the rumours being spread by the liquidators, or
over any possible Bureau decisions. We have taken steps to have the reports
on Russian affairs from London written through us (about
non-Russian affairs directly to
you)—c a l m l y  wait for them and you

    

will find that there was no need for any trip and that neither the barking
nor the Bureau will rescue the “drowning men” (the liquidators).  

There is private information that Plekhanov is not going.


This should not be printed just yet. I repeat: calmly wait for reports
from your own correspondent.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The December session of the International Socialist Bureau was
held in London on December 13 and 14, 1913, and discus ad the unification
of the British socialist and labour parties, the Vienna Congress, Russian
affairs, etc. The question of uniting the Social-Democratic Party in Russia
was brought up for debate just before the session closed. In view of the
late hour, the question was not discussed in detail, and the Bureau
confined itself to adopting a resolution motioned by Kautsky on behalf of
the German delegation. It authorised the Executive Committee of the
I.S.B. to call a conference of representatives of “all the factions of the
working-class movement in Russia, including Russian Poland, who accept the
Party Programme or whose programmes are in accord with the
Social-Democratic Programme, for an exchange of opinion (Aussprache) over
the issues on which they are divided”. Motivating the resolution, Kautsky
said on December 1 (14) that the old Social-Democratic Party in Russia was
dead. It was necessary to revive it, relying on the Russian workers’ desire
for unity. In his article “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech”, Lenin
analysed the content of the resolution and said Kautsky’s speech was a
monstrous one

(see present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 528–30).

Writing to Inessa Armand of the issue of Vorw\"arts which carried

   

Kautsky’s statement, Lenin said: “You should get hold of it and organise a
protest campaign. We are

f o r an exchange of opinion,

f o r the resolution of the I.S.B.—this NB—but we are
absolutely against Kautsky’s scoundrelly phrase. He should be beaten
unmercifully for this”

(present edition, Vol. 35, p. 130).

In a letter to the Bolshevik section in Paris, Lenin wrote: “It is most
desirable that the section should adopt a

s l a s h i n g resolution against Kautsky (calling his statement
about the Party’s death, shameless, brazen, monstrous, ignorant)”
(Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 48, p. 254).


The same sitting of the I.S.B. en December 1 (14) heard Plekhanov’s
letter saying that the split in the Duma group, which had taken place
through the fault of the liquidators, was a blow at the unity of the labour
movement and led him to resign as the representative of the whole Party in
the I.S.B. His place on the I.S.B. was taken fry P. B. Axelrod, a
representative of the liquidationist Organising Committee.  

At the conference held in Brussels in July 1914, under the
I.S.B. decision, the leaders of the Second International, on the pretext of
“reconciling” the Bolsheviks and the liquidators, demanded that the
Bolsheviks should stop criticising the latter. The Bolsheviks refused to do
so and continued their relentless struggle against the liquidators, who
were enemies of the labour movement.

In view of the All-Russia Congress on Public Education to
be held in December, it is appropriate that we should turn our attention to
an old question which is perpetually new: the poverty of the people’s
teachers.  

We have before us Volume I of the One-Day Census of Primary Schools
in the Empire. The volume has been published by the Ministry of
Public—what you might call—Education. It is signed by the well-known
statistician Mr.  V. I. Pokrovsky.  

The bureaucratic character of this official work—bureaucratic and
official in the worst sense of the words—instantly leaps to the eye. The
census was taken on January 18, 1911. It took all of two years to publish
its first volume dealing only with the gubernias of the St. Petersburg
academic district! The only thing we seem to be able to do in our country
without tedious, agonising red tape is to pass laws, like the law against
the press.  

As is the practice, the census programme was repeatedly discussed
throughout 1910 by a host of official cabinets and conferences, each of
which did something to spoil it. As a result, for instance, there is only
one head, “Russian Language”, on the question of the pupils’ mother
tongue:
it is clearly prohibited to make the subdivision into Byelorussian, Little
Russian (Ukrainian) and Great Russian. As a result, the census of the
schools of the Empire does not
    

include a number of schools, such as the urban schools set up
under the 1872 statute, private first-and second-category schools, etc.


It is prohibited to collect full data. It is prohibited to know the
truth about the language spoken by the pupils at home. It is prohibited to
make a comparison, between public and private schools.  

The man who compiled these statistics, Mr. Pokrovsky, much vaunted by
the liberals, has done his bit to spoil the census returns. Thus,
material has been separately collected on each teacher relative to the size
of salary. It is, naturally, important to know the truth on such a burning
question as the poverty of the people’s teachers. It is important to know
just how many masters and mistresses are receiving the desperately
low, the very lowest, the very low and the low salaries in general.  

The material on this has been collected. The information on it
is there. But our liberal statistician “processes” it in such a
way as to cover up the unsavoury truth.  

Our statistician merely informs us of the average salaries of
masters and mistresses by gubernia and the different categories of
schools. The official classifications are scrupulously observed. But anyone
who wants to know the truth is not interested in which gubernia and in
which category of schools the teachers starve, but how many
teachers are starving and living in poverty. It was quite possible to
determine from the returns of the census how many teachers are
being paid starvation salaries (say, under 360 rubles, from 360 to
400 rubles, etc.), and this should unquestionably have been done. But it
has not been done. It has been buried in the hundreds of thousands of cards
at the archives.  

What the public has been informed of is only the officially purged and
officially embellished averages of salaries by category and
gubernia.... Need we say, too, that the liberal statisticians made a point
of concealing from the public what percentage of the starving teachers have
families.  

These “average” figures show that a schoolmistress (in the
St. Petersburg academic district) receives 433 rubles a year, and a
schoolmaster, 376. But most of the teachers are in the countryside. There
“average” salaries are 347 rubles for the schoolmistress, and 367 rubles
for the schoolmaster. (Let us

    

note that the overall number of schoolmistresses is double that of
schoolmasters).  

Most of the teachers of the St. Petersburg district are
outside St. Petersburg Gubernia. The salaries of school-mistresses
are: Olonets Gubernia—375 rubles; Novgorod Gubernia—358 rubles; Vologda
Gubernia—320 rubles; Archangel Gubernia—319 rubles; and Pskov
Gubernia—312 rubles.  

Even these figures, which put a gloss on reality, make it clear that
the majority of schoolmistresses are paid a starvation
salary. With the present high cost of living the 26–30 rubles a
month for schoolmistresses, of whom (on average again) 11.5 per cent are
married and 4.4 per cent are widows, is undoubtedly a beggarly salary which
condemns teachers to starvation and indigence.  

From the “category” data we find that 2,180 schoolmistresses worked
in parish one-class schools (in the St. Petersburg academic district, with
a total of 7,693 schoolmistresses). Consequently, we have here a
“category” with a highly impressive number of teachers. What then are
they paid?  

An average of 302 rubles in the towns, and 301 rubles in
the villages.  

The Russian state spends hundreds of millions of rubles on the
maintenance of its civil service, the police, the army, etc., while dooming
teachers in the people’s schools to starvation. The bourgeoisie
“sympathises” with public education—with the proviso, however, that the
teachers live in worse conditions than the servants in the manor-houses and
the houses of the rich....

Lenin wrote the article in connection with the All-Russia Congress on
Public Education which was to be held in St. Petersburg during the winter
holidays at the end of December 1913. The Bolsheviks wanted to use the
Congress as a legal opportunity for spreading Bolshevik ideas and
revolutionary demands. The article is closely connected with Lenin’s “The
Question of Ministry of Education Policy”

(see present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 137–46).

In this issue of our newspaper comrades workers will find a
detailed account of the recent sitting of the International Socialist
Bureau in London, and also its resolution on the question of unity of the
Social-Democratic forces in Russia.  

Class-conscious workers throughout Russia must discuss this resolution
with the utmost attention.  
 

A class-conscious worker feels and realises himself to be not only a
member of the Russian Marxist family—he is aware that he is also
a member of the international family of Marxists. He also has
duties to the workers’ International. He must take account of the opinions
and wishes of the latter. He must not lose touch with the international
workers’ army for a single moment.  

Russian Marxist workers will welcome the fact that the workers’
International has shown a desire to make a serious study of the principled
discussions which have such a prominent part to play in our Russian
working-class movement. The accursed conditions of Russian social and
political life have led to a state where our comrades know much less about
our movement than about the movement in any other country. This lack of
knowledge about the real state of affairs in Russia is such that just
recently German Social-Democratic spokesmen proposed the convocation of all
circles of Russian Social-Democrats abroad (12 “trends” abroad) to work
out a new programme for the
Party.{1}

But, after all, everyone knows that the Russian proletariat worked out such
a programme back in 1903....  

This period is, fortunately, about to end. By its great and heroic
struggle,the Russian proletariat has made itself a talking point throughout
the civilised world. The working class of Russia has by rights taken up its
place in the workers’ International, and it is safe to say that with every
passing year its role in the international arena will be ever bigger and
more important.  

The decision of the International Bureau gives Russian workers their
first chance to acquaint our West-European comrades with the basic
substance of our discussions. The Bureau has put the question like this: 1)
it has offered its good offices to bring about unity; 2) it believes the
actual differences must be brought out; 3) therefore it has authorised its
Executive Committee to contact and arrange an exchange of opinion with all
Social-Democrats accepting the Social-Democratic programme and also those
whose programme is close to the Social-Democratic.  

Russian Marxists find all this quite acceptable.  
 

It is indeed extremely desirable to bring out the
differences. And even not only those between the Marxists and the
liquidators, but also those between the Marxists and the Narodniks, and the
Zionist Socialists (whom we regard as being not much worse than the Bund
and the P.P.S.), etc. It would be a considerable success if the
International Bureau managed to secure clear-cut and precise formulations
and to establish the actual basis of the political differences.  

But to clear up the differences does not at all mean to eliminate
them. The differences stem from the absolutely divergent views of the
present epoch in Russia. They constitute two tactics, two
systems of policy—the proletarian and the liberal: Nothing will eliminate
this divergence.  

But even there it is extremely desirable to have a precise and definite
elucidation of the terms for unity put forward by each of the
sides.  

Marxist workers are faced with this important task:
they must have a thorough discussion of the International Bureau’s proposal
and give it every possible attention, outlining their own terms of unity.


These terms are clear. They flow from the whole course of the
working-class movement. The liquidators must in fact recognise the
Marxist whole, they must recognise that the main slogans for agitation
among the masses are the three old and basic demands; they must withdraw
their amendments to the programme (cultural-national autonomy); they must
refrain from shouting about the “strike itch”; condemn the Bundists’
separatist strivings and demand local mergers; condemn the malicious
personal attacks which poison the ideological struggle, etc. In the sphere
of Duma activity, the Seven must unconditionally recognise their
subordination to the Marxist whole and retract their anti-Party decisions
(Jagiello, abolition of the programme, etc.). Even Comrade Plekhanov, who
disagrees with us on many points, says in his letter to the International
Bureau that “our Duma group is divided in consequence of certain
regrettable decisions adopted by our comrades liquidators, who find
themselves in a majority of seven to six”.  
 

It has not yet been cleared up whom it would be useful for the
International Bureau to contact for arranging the general exchange of
opinion. It is clear that there are two possible ways: either invitations
should go out to representatives of the two principal trends: Marxists and
liquidators, or to “all Social-Democrats”, and all who regard themselves
as being close to the Social-Democrats, in which case it would mean the
party of deputy Jagiello (P.P.S.) and various Jewish socialist groups, and
those of the Narodniks who consider their stand close to the
Social-Democratic programme.  

Every class-conscious worker should take an interest in the question
raised by the International Bureau. We urge all workers to raise this
question at their meetings, circles, talks, rallies, etc., to discuss it,
to adopt their resolutions and to publish their opinion in our newspaper.


It is wrong to think that this business is remote and has nothing to do
with us. If the question is raised at the inter national congress in
Vienna{2} (something Marxists would very gladly welcome), the
International must know the opinion of the Russian workers, of the
proletarian organisations operating in Russia, and not only of the isolated
circles abroad.  

Comrades! Discuss this important question, adopt your decisions and
communicate them to your newspaper, Proletarskaya Pravda. The
class-conscious workers of all countries will listen to what you say.

The question of the Vienna congress was discussed by the International
Socialist Bureau in December 1913. It was decided to call the Congress in
August 1914, timing it to coincide with the celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the First International. The following questions were
entered on its, agenda: 1) high cost of living; 2) imperialism and the
struggle against militarism, which included as subquestions: a) the Eastern
question; b) compulsory courts of arbitration between nations and c) United
States of Europe; 3) alcoholism; 4) unemployment; 5) condition of political
prisoners and exiles in Russia; and 6) miscellaneous. No country was to
have a delegation numbering more than six times the number of its votes;
hence, Russia, with 20 votes, could have no more than 120 delegates for
both subsections of the Social-Democrats and the Left Narodniks and the
trade unions together.  

The question of the International Socialist Congress in Vienna was
discussed at the Poronin Conference of the C.C. with Party
functionaries. Lenin, reporting on the question, proposed that all measures
should be taken to have Social-Democratic workers in a majority as
delegates to the Vienna Congress. By the end of July 1914, the elections to
the International Socialist Congress

   

were almost completed, but the outbreak of the world war prevented the
Congress from being held.

The International Socialist Bureau has decided to take
steps to clarify the differences between Russian socialists and to offer
its good offices to unite their forces.  

What have the liquidators made of this decision?  

They have right away made use of it to cheat the Russian
workers.

 

A solemn editorial article in No. 97 of Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta{1} says: 


   “By rejecting the demand of the ‘Six’ for special
   representation in the interparliamentary section, the International Bureau
   not only unequivocally condemned their break-away from the
   Social-Democratic group, but also gave a proper assessment of one of the
   main demands, whose rejection the six deputies tried to use as an
   explanation and justification of their walk-out.”  


That is not true from start to finish.  

We noted this in No. 1 of our
newspaper.{2} 

The liquidators, caught red-handed, are trying to mislead the workers
by continuing their lies.  

We repeat that the International Bureau did not reject the demand of
the Six. It did not condemn their “break away”. It did not even go into
an examination of the dispute between the six and the seven deputies.  

This is nothing but a liquidationist trick.  

The liquidator gentlemen resorted to the same criminal method last year
after the sitting of the International Bureau, when Mr. Martov attributed
to the German Social-Democrat Haase words he had never said against the
Bolsheviks, for which he was subsequently exposed in Haase’s published
statement.  

Here is how the question of deputy representation stood in the
Bureau. The representative of the Marxists merely said that the delegate of
the Seven was elected only by the Seven and that the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group does not recognise him as its
delegate. Comrade Huysmans, Secretary of the International Bureau, gave the
following explanation. There are special rules on the interparliamentary
section. According to the rules, where there are several separate socialist
groups in a given parliament, representation is given only to the group
which has more deputies; the rules take no account of which party the given
parliamentary group belongs to and how many workers there are behind
it. The point to note is that parties have their own special
representation.  

Under these rules, if there were, say, two groups in the Duma, six
Social-Democrats and seven Narodniks, only the Narodniks would be
given the vote in the interparliamentary representation.  
 

Here is another example: Bulgaria. There, 19 Shiroki Socialists
(opportunists) and 18 Marxists were elected to Parliament. The two
constitute separate parties and have two separate groups in
Parliament. Both parties also have separate representatives on the
Bureau. But according to the rules, the parliamentary
representation can go only to the Shiroki group of 19. That does not mean,
in any sense, that the Bureau “condemned” the 18 Marxist deputies.  

That was the formal side of the matter. Any view can be taken of the
rules. But just now that’s what they are. In these conditions, the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group could not even present its demand.  

What should the Seven have done if they wished to be honest? They
should have waived the formalities themselves. It has now been proved and
recognised by everyone that several times more organised Social-Democratic
workers are backing the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group than the
Seven. The implication is clear. Those who wish to reckon with the voice of
the workers, those who talk so much about unity, should in that case have
done more than take the strictly formal approach.  

However, the Seven capitalised on their “luck” under the rules. They
have once again issued a challenge to the Russian workers. What is more,
the liquidator gentlemen also began to tell lies about the International
allegedly “condemning” the Six, etc.  

That was the first response on the part of the liquidator gentlemen to
the resolution of the International Socialist Bureau.  

Marxist workers will respond to this liquidator fraud by publicly
branding these gentlemen.  

Comrades, you must continue your serious and thorough discussion of the
Bureau’s decision, voice your opinion and give the liquidators the response
they deserve for their attempts to cheat the Russian workers.

of the liquidators, who insist that in denying the Six special
representation, the Bureau allegedly condemned the principle of
‘federation’, put forward by the six workers deputies in the
Social-Democratic group. The demand for special representation for the Six
was not at all presented to the Bureau for purely formal reasons; this
shows that N.R.G.’s statements to the effect that, the Bureau had issued a
condemnation of the Six is part of the dishonest lying of the liquidators
in their continued efforts to dim the consciousness of the working class.”

We warmly welcome the decision of the workers’
International concerning the need for full and final clarification of the
substantial and basic differences existing in Russia between the political
trends participating in the working-class movement.  

In response to the International’s proposal we believe it necessary,
for our part, to outline the basic differences which, in our opinion,
divide the Marxists and the liquidators into two irreconcilable camps.


We declare, first of all, that for any class-conscious worker it is not
a matter of setting up some new entity, but merely of strengthening and
fully restoring the old organisation as it took shape more than 15 years
ago—with its old programme and its most important tactical decisions. The
liquidators have split away from this Marxist organisation. These are the
necessary conditions for restoring unity with them in the sphere of work
outside the Duma: 

1) Full and unconditional recognition (in fact) of “the underground”,
unconditional subordination to the decisions of its cells and an
undertaking not to allow, in any circumstances, any kind of attacks against
it in the press.  

2) Full and unconditional recognition of the fact that the main task of
the epoch consists of the three principal demands put forward by the
working class of Russia, performance of work in that spirit, and
repudiation of the liberal-reformist preachings calling for abdication of
the old tasks.  

3) Retraction of all attempts to change the programme of the Marxists
(cultural-national autonomy) and unconditional acceptance of the programme
worked out in 1903.  

4) Full subordination on questions connected with the strike movement
to the decisions of workers organised on Marxist lines, and repudiation of
the struggle against the so-called “strike itch”.  

5) Recognition in fact of the proletariat’s independent
tactics, and refusal to play down the tasks of the working class for the
sake of blocs with the liberals.  
 

6) Recognition that in the matter of work in the trade unions guidance
should be taken from the decisions of the International Socialist Congress
in Stuttgart and the London Congress of Russian Marxists.  

7) Repudiation of the principle of establishing workers’ organisations
on the national basis. Establishment of united organisations in
Poland and the North-Western Territory. Fulfilment by the Bund of the
decision on local mergers which has been repeatedly reiterated by Russian
Marxists as a whole.  

These are the terms for unity in the sphere of Duma activity:


I. Recognition that the group is an organ unconditionally subordinated
to the organised will of the Marxist whole.  

II. Retraction of all the violations of the programme
(cultural-national autonomy, acceptance of Jagiello, etc.).  

III. Condemnation of the splitting acts of the Seven, which have also
been condemned by G. V. Plekhanov in his letter to the International
Socialist Bureau.  

As for the groups which it would be useful for the Inter national
Bureau to contact for arranging a general exchange of opinion, we demand,
above all, that participation in it should be confined exclusively
to representatives of workers’ organisations existing in Russia, and should
in no instance include any of the circles abroad which are not connected
with work in Russia.  

We furthermore believe that: 1) either invitations should go out
only to the representatives of the two principal trends
struggling in Russia, i.e., the Marxists and the liquidators, 2) or, if
there is a desire to clarify all differences in general between the Russian
Social-Democrats and those who regard themselves as Social-Democrats?
invitations should go out, without exception, to all workers’ organisations
operating in Russia and regarding themselves as being close to the
Social-Democrats. In that case, there is no reason to exclude some of the
Left-wing Narodniks, or the Jewish groups who regard themselves as
socialists and who compete with the Bund, etc.  

Finally, we feel sure that in order to throw a true light on the
differences among Russian Social-Democrats, the foreign socialist press
will make its pages available to responsible

    

representatives of Russian organisations who—in contrast to
émigré circles and irresponsible persons—could give the
foreign comrades a precise idea of the ideological and political basis of
the differences in the Russian working-class movement.  

A group of organised Marxists

The all-Russia school census of January 18, 1911, makes it
possible—despite the extremely bad processing of the data—slightly to
lift the veil of official secrecy.  

The only data available so far are those on the St. Petersburg academic
district, separately for the towns and villages. Let us see on the basis of
these data what our parish schools are like.  

In the towns, there were 329 city one-class schools, 139 private
third-category and 177 parish one-class schools.  Let us compare the
schoolmistresses’ average salaries (the number of schoolmasters is quite
small): city schools—924 rubles a year, private—609,
parish—302.  

Poor, starving schoolmistresses—that is what our parish schools are.


Let us see what the percentage of teachers with higher and secondary
lay general education is. In the city schools—76 per cent, private—67
per cent, and parish—18 per cent!  

Uneducated schoolmistresses (we say nothing as yet about the teachers
of catechism)—that is what our parish schools are.  

In the villages we have 3,545 Zemstvo one-class schools and 2,506
parish one-class schools. In the former, the average salary of
schoolmistresses is 374 rubles a year, in the latter—301 rubles.


In the former, educated teachers (teachers in general) come to 20
per cent, in the latter—2.5 per cent—once again without the
teachers of catechism.  

These data give an idea of the plight of the parish schools!  
 

The census has also collected data on the average number of square
       arshins{1}

of floor-space and cubic arshins of air space per pupil—i.e., the
crowding of schools.  

The Zemstvo schools have 2.6 sq. arshins of floor-space and 10.1
cu. arshins of air; the parish schools, 2.4 sq. arshins and 9.6
cu. arshins, respectively.  

The floor-space should be six times the light area of the
windows. Actually, it is nine times greater, i.e., the schools are not only
crowded, but also dark.  

These data are, of course, extremely meagre. The Ministry tried very
hard to prevent the collection of detailed, precise and full data
on the beggarly condition of our schools.  

Even so, the beggarly condition of the parish schools stands out in
these incomplete, officially curtailed and poorly processed data.  

One of the vital tasks before the representatives of workers’ cultural
and educational and trade union organisations at the forthcoming All-Russia
Congress on Public Education is to make a comprehensive presentation of the
question and to shed every possible light on the condition of our schools
and schoolteachers.

Lomtatidze’s letter on the struggle between the Six and the
Seven in the Duma group was curiously run in the liquidators’ newspaper
alongside the calculation that 3,701 persons came out in favour of the
liquidators (No. 75, p. 2). We leave the verification of this figure for
another article, merely noting that three days earlier Za
Pravdu (No. 26) reported the figure of 5,000, which has not been
refuted by our opponents.  

The Seven have been clearly shown again and again to represent
a minority of the workers.  
 

That is why Lomtatidze’s “tough words” make an especially
awkward impression. It is a sign of extreme weakness and impotent irritation to
call names, to give a reminder of various episodes of the old and most
embittered struggle, and to shout: “This is impudent, absurd,
cynical”, etc., etc.


It remains an unrefuted and incontrovertible fact that
1) the majority of class-conscious workers are backing the
Six; and that 2) the Seven refuse to recognise the will and the
decisions of the majority, and also refuse to recognise the
governing institution accepted by the majority.


One feels a sense of embarrassment and shame for the irritated
Lomtatidze, when he says:


“Have they (the Six) indicated a single instance in which
the political actions in the Duma have run counter to the
interests of our cause, our slogans and our traditions?”


Lomtatidze’s lofty tone makes a false impression, once we are aware that
not only the Six, but the highest governing institution, which they recognise,
have long since indicated officially and in formal terms the
violation of the programme by the Seven, to cite an instance!


With his clumsy irritation and his irrelevant questions, Lomtatidze merely
underscores the really profound essence of the entire
conflict—the fight of non-Party men against the Party
principle. That is the essence. Nor is it a joke or a trifle but the most
serious and painful question.


Not everyone who says: “Lord! Lord!” will enter the
kingdom of heaven! Not everyone who beats his breast and
shouts “unity, unity” is actually working for unity.


What is working-class unity?


It is above all and chiefly unity of its political organisation, of its
entity. That is the only kind of unity that can ensure real unity of
the Duma group and of all the action and struggle of the working class in
general.


That is the unity the liquidationist trend has violated, as the Party’s
official resolutions have repeatedly recognised since 1908. That is the crux of
the matter. In evading it, Lomtatidze merely reveals his error.


The Seven are entirely to blame for the split, because they have
violated the programme, they have come out in defence of the
liquidators, who were destroying the Party, they have ignored the
formal decisions of the majority, and

    

they have been violating the will of the organised workers. There is no
other way out for them but to recognise their fault, accept the Six as
representatives of the majority and start systematically moving closer to them
through an agreement.

  Introduction. 


 Importance of the National Question
    at the Current Historical Moment






      1. Government’s nationalism. All counter-revolution is dyed in
      nationalistic colours.
    

      2. Idem—bourgeois liberalism (Struve & Co.).
    

      3. With incredible, unprecedented oppression of non-Russian nations
      (57 per cent of the population of Russia)—nationalism in oppressed
      nations (pan European fight).
    

      4. Breach of R.S.D.L.P. programme (distortion of self-determination
      +cultural-national autonomy).
    

      5. Split of Jewish separatism. National isolation.
    




B.



      6. National question must be viewed historically and
      economically. National question is a world wide phenomenon.
    
    

    
7. Epoch of national movements—end of Middle Ages and start of new period,
epoch of
b o u r g e o i s-  d e m o c r a t i c revolutions. At the
time, national movements everywhere.


8. Economic foundations? Capitalism demands consolidation of domestic
   market. The market is the centre of commercial relations. Language
   is the chief instrument of human commercial relations.


9. Consolidation of national areas (restoration of language, national awakening,
   etc.) and establishment of
  n a t i o n a l  s t a t e.  Economic
   necessity of it.


10. Political superstructure over the economy. Democracy, sovereignty of
    nation.
H e n c e,  “n a t i o n a l  state”....


11. National state is
  t h e  r u l e  t h r o u g h o u t  t h e  w o r l d =
(K. Kautsky in I,
    18{1}

,

pp. 23 and 23–25, Internationalit\"at), while
    “state of
    nationalities is the exception”.{16}

   K. Kautsky about 0. Bauer: Bauer
  u n d e r e s t i m a t e s  the urge
for national state.

(“the strength of the Drang”)


[BOX:]
NB

[BOX ENDS:]
In brackets: some people believe that the national state means
  g r e a t e r  nationalism than cultural-national
 autonomy. That is a naive and
ridiculous delusion! The national state is the rule in the record of world
history. Cultural-national autonomy is an invention of rather poor intellectuals
which has not been realised anywhere.


12. Epoch of national (bourgeois-democratic) revolutions of the nineteenth
    century (Italy, Germany). It is over in Western Europe.
  I t  h a s  j u s t
    s t a r t e d  i n  t h e  E a s t  a n d  i n  A s i a....





C.
Two theories of Marxism on the national question.





13. Emergence of proletarian parties in national states.

    


Backward East. “Theories” of national question.
(Little attention given to theoretical basis.
K. Kautsky+0. Bauer.)


14. 0. Bauer.
Nation=Kulturgemeinschaft{2}

.

“National culture” slogan ((red thread)). The main thing
  is the national character. (Mass of reservations,
  but that is not important.)


             (Kautsky’ s assessment: Kulturgemeinschaft=0. Bauer’s main
          mistake.)


15. “Socialism will put more emphasis on the principle
  of nationality” (0. Bauer I,
5{3}

—p. 532

of his book).


16. Bauer’s basic mistake is refined nationalism, a nationalism which is
    clean, without exploitation and without fighting.


NB |||


Proudhon used to clean up, idealise and embellish NB capitalism, 0. Bauer does
the same to nationalism.



17. The policy of the ruling classes is “conservative-national”, ours is
“evolutionary-national” (0. Bauer).


      18. “We are not satisfied with the old internationalism”

      
      (0. Bauer)

      
      (0. Bauer I, 6).
    

      19. σσ of 0. Bauer

      
         (α) idealistic theory of nation

      
         (β) national culture slogan (== bourgeois)

      
         (δ) nationalism purified, refined, absolute, right up
      to socialism

      
         (γ) internationalism completely forgotten.

      
       σ=n a t i o n a l  o p p o r t u n i s m
      (Pannekoek).
    

      20. Confused 0. Bauer, exposed by
       K. Kautsky.

      

  (α) Eigent\"umlich und
  hinf\"allig{4}

  in that 0. Bauer keeps talking about national
  culture. (I, 17) (p. 15, Internationalit\"at.

differing from

bourgeois by non-aggressiveness, equa lity, etc., but an economically and culturally united social organism” (ibidem, p. 17).

In 0. Bauer this view has disappeared behind the “Betonung der

D.
§ 9 of the programme=political self-determination.





22. What it means in principle and as used by the whole of international
    democracy since 1848=political separation, formation of national
    state.

    

    
23. What it means from the standpoint of the
h i s t o r y  of national movements throughout the
world=establishment of national state.


24. Funny attempts to give this paragraph a different interpretation
    (ridiculous!)!! The

    national question





(α).

  (α)  is
  i n d i s s o l u b l y  bound up with the

25. Departure from the democratic principle is betraying
      and forgetting the whole of history.

      
      Bourgeois revolution incomplete.
    




(β)

(β) Russia==national state at bottom, at base.


the centre


[BOX:]



    Pskov—


    Rostov-on-Don


  Outlying areas—non-Russian.


  Extreme oppression.


Incompleteness of bourgeois-democratic revolution, which is
  i m p o s s i b l e  without a national movement and the urge
 to set up
  n a t i o n a l  states in general.

  

26. Russia’s international position: next to it is Austria





(γ)

(γ) (with an
    unfinished bourgeois revolution in respect
of the national question) and an awakened Asia (republican China).


   Tsarism is the most reactionary state system. Hence the particular
 inevitability of the national movement, and the demand that the Great
 Russians recognise the right to self-determination.






27. Concrete example. Norway (six centuries under Denmark). At the
    beginning of the nineteenth
century

[BOX ENDS:]
Epoch of Napoleonic wars

handed over to Sweden (under a treaty between Sweden, Britain and
Russia). Taken through a
  w a r  between the Swedes and the Norwegians.


   Annexed by Sweden. Retained
c o m p l e t e  autonomy (parliament, army, taxes, duties,
etc.). Decades of friction and fighting.


   1905. Start of the great revolution in the east of

    

Europe—close by an unfinished bourgeois-democratic revolution in
a neighbouring, West-European, very free state. Result? Norwegian
revolution of 1905.

   August revolution in Norway. Decision of the parliament (August 17,
 1905). Agitation by priests and landowners in Sweden.


 Referendum


[BOX:]


5 million Swedes


and 2 million Norwegians.


   Treaty with neighbouring state. Peace and lull completion.


   Swedish worker’s duty? Stand not only for freedom in general,
not only for autonomy, but without fail, for the
r i g h t  to secede.


28. 1905. Finland and Poland.


   Deals between the national bourgeoisie and the Russian
 bourgeoisie. Tasks of the class parties:
struggle against nationalistic deals, for an
  a l l i a n c e  w i t h  t h e
r e v o l u t i o n a r y  p r o l e t a r i a t  i n  R u s s i a.


29. Result:

      

(α) Importance of § 9 from the entire
history of national movement.


(β) National oppression in Russia under
the national state at the base and national oppression in the border
areas.


(γ) Unfinished bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia.


(δ) Russia’s international position.


  (ε) Independent decision on the question
  of secession, but there must be propaganda.










30. Special stand of P.S.D.


  Development of capitalism has bound up Poland and Russia closely
 together. Lodz factories working for the Russian market. It is not our
 business to set up a new class state. Is that all?


  (α) Failure to say: is the bourgeois-democratic revolution in
 Russia and in the Eastcompleted? No.

    


  (β) The whole point is not Poland or her secession, but the
 Russian muzhik.


1863


November 1905


Rebuttal of the nationalism of the Russian muzhik is more than the demand
for the non-oppression of nations, more than autonomy, it is, without fail,
the right to secede.


[BOX:]


To deny or weaken this is absurd and reactionary.


To deny the right to secede is to help tsarism and to
indulge the Russian muzhik’s nationalism.


]] NB


(γ) Example: Marx’s attitude to Poland (Lopatin) and to
Ireland....{17}

Marx on Ireland. No nation oppressing
the freedom of another nation can be free.


]]
NB




Whence the P.S.D.’s absurdity?


   Inside-out nationalism.


    Scared by the Papuans.


    Cracow—an example.


Along the wrong line.


The history of the P.S.D.’s promotion of its absurd
and reactionary idea.


   1895: K. Kautsky


   (α) Materialismus
einseitig{10}

   (β) are you afraid of indulging the nationalism of the petty
 bourgeoisie? You are helping the Russian reactionaries!

   1903. Second Congress committee vs. Warski.{18}






E.
Equality of nations and minority rights....






31. No privileges for any nation or language.


   That is necessary from the standpoint of elementary democracy and
 working-class solidarity.

The theses were apparently written by Lenin after his lecture in Paris
on January 10 (23), 1914 (see Lenin Miscellany XXX,
pp. 51–57). The inscription on the cover of the “National Question III”
notebook is an indication that Lenin repeated his Paris lecture at

At the third sitting of the Programme Committee of the Second Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P., the delegate of the Social-Democracy of Poland and
Lithuania motioned the adoption of the item on guarantees for “freedom of
cultural development of all nations making up the state” (see Lenin’s note
of it in Lenin Miscellany VI, p. 105).

{19}

Diaspora (Gk. for dispersal)—the Jews living outside
Judea. In the early 6th century B.C., there were Jewish communities in
Egypt, Babylon and other countries of the Mediterranean. From the 3rd
century B.C., the Diaspora grew rapidly, so that in the 1st century B.C.,
their number came to 4.5 million. In the Roman Empire, the Jews lived in
communities, sometimes forming public-law corporations (as in Alexandria),
or private religious societies (as in Rome). On the one hand, the Jews of
the Diaspora successfully conducted the propaganda of Judaism, and on the
other, they

   

wore gradually losing their national traits and language.

p. 322





{20}

“Federation of the worst type” was the term used in the
decisions of the Prague Party Conference of 1912 to characterise the
relations with non-Russian national Social-Democratic organisations in the
R.S.D,L.P. after the Fourth (Unity) Congress, when the “non-Russians”
worked “in total isolation from Russian organisations”, which had an
extremely negative effect on the whole work of the R.S.D.L.P. While the
Social-Democratic organisations of Poland and Lithuania, the Latvian
Territory and the Bund were formally part of the R.S.D.L.P., they actually
held themselves aloof. Their representatives did not take part in the
direction of Party work throughout Russia, and promoted, directly or
indirectly, the anti-Party activity of the liquidators

(see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 464–65, and Vol. 18, pp. 411–12).

There are hardly any illiterates in the civilised countries. An effort is made
to get the people into the schools. Every thing is done to set up
libraries. Over here, the Ministry of Public, what you might call,
“Education” resorts to the most desperate efforts, to the most
ignominious police measures to hamper the cause of education and to
prevent the people from acquiring knowledge! Over here, the Ministry
has destroyed school libraries!! No civilised country in the world
still has any special rules against libraries, or such a foul
institution as the censorship. But over here, apart from the
persecution of the press in general, apart from the wild measures
against libraries in general, rules which are a hundred times more
restrictive are being issued against
    

the public libraries! This is an outrageous policy of
benightingthe people, an outrageous policy of the landowners, who
want the country to become barbaric. Some rich men, like
Pavlenkov, have donated money for public libraries. Now, the wild
landowners’ government has destroyed the libraries. Isn’t it about time for
those who want to helpeducation in Russia to understand that the
money should be donated not for the libraries which are under the Ministry
and are due to be destroyed, but for the struggle for political freedom,
without which Russia is suffocating in barbarism.

REPORT OF THE R.S.D.L.P. CENTRAL COMMITTEE AT THE FOURTH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESS OF THE LATVIAN TERRITORY 

 L e n i n
(representative of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party). Comrade Braun said that there was no need to rummage in
scrap paper, in old documents. That is right. Still, one must base oneself
on documents and other evidence. A closer study of the R.S.D.L.P. activity
over the last two years shows up the existence of liquidationism, which has
hampered the re establishment of the Party. Unless we make a study of the
political causes of the Party split, we shall be unable to understand the
present disarray. Erroneous trends were already pointed out at the 1908
Conference and later at the 1910 Plenary Meeting. On the one hand, there is
otzovism, which has failed to understand the new conditions in Russia, and
on the other, liquidationism, which either rejects the

    

Party or minimises the importance of the illegal Party. These trends arose
under the influence of the bourgeoisie. Liquidationism is a broad
phenomenon. As early as 1906, there appeared men among the
Socialist-Revolutionaries (Narodniks) who tried to legalise the Party. That
is a policy of adaptation we see the Cadets pursuing. The same spirit of
time-serving prevails among the Social-Democrat liquida tots. A strong
party can be set up only in the struggle against this liquidationism. That
was already clearly stated by the 1908 Conference. After the Plenary
Meeting the Party split up. The Central Committee Bureau Abroad, failing to
call a Plenary Meeting, was itself subsequently wound up. The Party had to
be re-established in struggle against the liquidators, and that was done by
the January conference. It adopted a decision to the effect that the
liquidators had to be fought in the workers’ curia, but Comrade Braun
called the decision Asiatic. However, such a decision is merely a more
consistent conclusion from the resolution adopted by the Plenary
Meeting. The January Conference was censured on every hand.  

But what was the actual situation over this January Conference? If it
had in fact been nothing but a conference of splitters, the whole Party
should have rallied to prove that the Conference did not represent the
Party. But that did not happen. Comrade Braun said: the broad masses are
not following Lenin. But serious-minded persons do not decide matters in
that way; the facts must be examined to their full extent. And what do the
facts indicate? The data on the results of the elections in the workers’
curia were published: at the elections to the Second Duma the Bolsheviks
received 47 per cent of the votes, at the elections to the Third Dunn, 50
per cent, and at the elections to the Fourth Duma, 67 per cent. These facts
are incontrovertible, and prove that the decisions of the January
Conference were correct. What the Conference decided was realised at the
elections. The majority of class-conscious workers in Russia are following
the Bolsheviks, and this proves that the struggle against the liquidators
was necessary. Even the legal press now admits that the majority of the
class-conscious workers are backing the Bolsheviks.  
 

According to Comrade Braun, the August
conference{2} adopted the
demands he put forward: the democratic republic slogan and the need for an
illegal party. Why, in that case, does Comrade Braun want to leave the
Organising Committee set up by the conference? That is not evidence of
political wisdom or steadfastness in political activity. Comrade Braun said
that there were now only a few odd liquidators among the writers but that
liquidationism as such no longer existed. But what then is the meaning of
Luch attacking the illegal Party and fighting against the
pro-Party men? The liquidators have failed to keep their promises to
Comrade Braun: they did not support the democratic republic slogan and the
need for an illegal party. The Latvians want to withdraw from the
Organising Committee. That, too, shows that the August bloc was nothing but
a fiction. It is ridiculous or even demagogic to talk of unity with the
liquidators, until they abandon their present views and adopt views that
are diametrically (completely) opposed to their present ones. There can be
no unity so long as liquidationism remains what it is. Those who stand for
a legal party will not unite with those who stand for an illegal one. There
are now two parties, one real, the other fictitious. This fictitious party
consists of a group of intellectuals whose attacks on the illegal Party
merely disorganise the workers. Luch itself does not unite all the
writers of the August bloc, but only the liquidators. The only thing to do
about the liquidators is to fight them.  

“Demagogy”, “unity”, “splitters”, are only loud words and nothing
more; even a parrot can mouth them. But let us look at the facts. In the
course of a year, Pravda united almost 2,000 workers’ groups, and
Luch, only 550. The organ which stands for the illegal Party
mustered four times more supporters than the “all trend” paper. The facts
show that they, the Bolsheviks, united the majority of the Russian
workers. This point was also made by the conference convened in summer.


Lenin is being rebuked for splitting the group. But, for a whole year,
six deputies fought against liquidationism in the group. The majority is
for the Bolsheviks, the Party is behind them. The group must submit to the
Party majority

    

and must act together with the Party. By failing to do so they place
themselves outside the Party, by the side of the Party. It is everywhere
established that the group must submit to the decisions of the party. We
must have the same thing in Russia as well. The deputies of the Duma are
not just Social-Democratic chatterboxes, but Party workers who must submit
to the Party.  

Everything that is behind the liquidators is fiction, phrase-mongering,
name-calling. What has actually happened since the group split up? The six
deputies have got 6,000 signatures, the seven, 2,000. Anyone can read about
this in the press. Martov said that behind the Seven were Marxist
institutions, but these are institutions which do not represent the mass of
Party members, but are only a fiction.  

The Bolsheviks stand for unity. But who are those people who are unable
to join the illegal Party? The illegal Party must be united. It must be
united from below. Fighting is the only thing that can be done against
those who attack the illegal Party and belittle the importance of such a
party. Let’s have a guarantee that the illegal Party will remain intact,
that the democratic republic slogan will not be stained—only then is
unity possible at the top and at the bottom. I do not know about Asia, but
in Europe splitters are those who refuse to recognise the
majority. Splitters are a minority who refuse to submit to majority
decisions.

SUMMING-UP SPEECH AT THE FOURTH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS OF THE LATVIAN
TERRITORY 

 L e n i n.

I am being attacked for “demagogic methods”, for splitting, etc. But what
have our opponents been doing? They have always thrown dirt at the
Bolsheviks. You have an example in Martov’s unseemly pamphlet.—I merely

    

expressed my opinion that the Bolsheviks would attend the conference of the
International Bureau. But the decision is still up to the Central
Committee, on which the workers are sitting. It is they and not Lenin that
will decide this question.—Those who say that there is no liquidationism,
show little respect for the Congress. What liquidationism is has already
been clearly stated in Party decisions since 1908. These decisions have not
been revoked and they must be reckoned with. Liquidationist ideas are now
being preached in the newspapers of the “August bloc”. Supporters of the
Organising Committee here insist that they are not opposing the Party, but
what has their paper been saying? Such examples are numerous. The
conciliator An wanted to come out against the no-Party agitation, but the
Editorial Board refused to change its view. There can be no union with
those who stand up for the views of the newspaper Luch. It is
liquidationism to work for an “open labour party”.—The conference which
is being called should not be attended for the purpose of uniting with the
liquidators, but for exposing them and proving that the August bloc is a
fiction.—The liquidationist press has been narrowing down the slogans and
curbing the revolutionary tactics. The liquidators have no illegal
literature of any sort; only the Bolsheviks have such literature. The
existence of Bolshevik organisations in Russia is evident from the last
issue (31). The elections to the Fourth Duma have also shown that the
overwhelming majority of the workers are behind the Bolsheviks.  These are
facts which everyone can verify. This is also evidenced by the financial
support to the newspapers.—Cries about unity are not important in
themselves. The ability to unite must be there. The Bolsheviks in Russia
have united a majority, while the August conference; by contrast, has
united nothing. Braun is pulling away from it, Trotsky is doing the
same—the “August bloc” is falling apart. Buryanov, too, has not
remained among the seven deputies.—To make union possible the liquidators
must be condemned.

DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE ATTITUDE OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS OF THE LATVIAN
TERRITORY TO THE R.S.D.L.P. 
  Ziemelis’s Resolution  

1. There is an overriding need to unite all truly Social-Democratic
forces and have strict Party unity in Russia, especially now that the
working-class struggle has been steadily expanding. Such unity is possible
only between Social-Democrats who in their activity recognise that: 

a) at the present time the R.S.D.L.P. can exist only illegally and that
all Social-Democrats must join the illegal Party organisation; 

b) Russian Social-Democracy must conduct agitation among the masses in
the spirit of the revolutionary demands of 1905, urging the workers to
march in the van of the entire emancipation movement and to work for
another revolution.  

The Congress recognises that every town must have a united
Social-Democratic organisation to include workers of all nationalities
and to conduct work in all the languages spoken by the local
proletariat. The Congress invites Social-Democrats of all nationalities to
work vigorously for real proletarian unity, a unity which is truly solid
and which is organised by the workers themselves from below.  

2. For the last five years, the liquidationist trend has been
the central question of the internal Party struggle. As early as the
All-Russia Conference of 1908, before any splits had occurred, the Party
resolved that it regarded liquidationism as an attempt by a section of the
Party intelligentsia to liquidate the existing R.S.D.L.P. organisation and
to substitute for it an amorphous association within a legal framework,
regardless of anything, even if the price to be paid were patent
repudiation of the Party’s programme, tactics and traditions.  

At the Plenary Meeting of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee in
January 1910, at which all directions and trends in the Party were
represented, liquidationism was once

    

again unanimously condemned by the whole Party as a
“manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat”, which was
expressed in the rejection of the illegal Social-Democratic Party, the
belittling of its role and importance, the attempts to curtail the
programme and tactical tasks and slogans of revolutionary Social-Democracy,
and so on.  

The attempt on the part of the conciliators to unite with the
liquidators at any price (the August 1912 conference) proved to be useless,
and the uniters found themselves ideologically and politically dependent on
the liquidators.  

The Fourth Social-Democratic Congress of the Latvian Territory
definitely condemns the liquidationist trend and resolves to recall its
representative from the Organising Committee, which has failed to
dissociate itself from the liquidators.  

3. In order to conduct broad political campaigns, the Congress
authorises the Central Committee to contact organisations whose political
line coincides with the resolutions adopted at the Congress.  

4. The Congress welcomes the initiative of the International Socialist
Bureau in raising the question of unification in Russian Social-Democracy,
and authorises the Central Committee to promote this through all relevant
steps, while standing up for the views expressed in this resolution.

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Fourth Social-Democratic Congress of the Latvian Territory
was held in Brussels from January 13 to 26 (January 26 to February 8) 1914.


Lenin took an active part in preparing and holding the Congress. He
gave a report on the attitude of the Social-Democracy of the Latvian
Territory to the R.S.D.L.P. and to the split in the Duma group, and took
part in conferences of Bolshevik delegates, helping theta to draft
resolutions. On the eve of the Congress, January 12 (25). Lenin gave a
lecture for the delegates on the national question, setting out the
relevant Bolshevik theory and tactics. Lenin urged the Marxists of Latvia
to strengthen the Party’s real—instead of imaginary—unity and keep its
ranks clean of vacillators and liquidators, who were patent traitors to the
working-class cause. He made wide use of the resolutions of the Fourth
Congress to fight the liquidators and Trotskyites. See his articles “The
Lettish Workers and the Split in the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma”,
“The ‘August’ Fiction Exposed”, “The Liquidators and the Lettish
Working-Class Movement”

(see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 177–81, 182–85, 239–41)

and others. Thanks to the persistent struggle against the conciliatory
tendencies conducted by Lenin and the Latvian Bolsheviks at the Congress,
the Latvian Social-Democrats withdrew from the August bloc, and this, Lenin
said, was a “death blow” at the Trotskyite association.  

The minutes of the Congress have not been discovered, but it is known
that they were prepared for publication by Janson-Braun and were left in
Brussels. At the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee, there are, in the
Poronin-Cracow material, Lenin’s writings relating to the Congress and
characterising the struggle waged by him and the Bolshevik section of the
Congress against the liquidators. Among the documents is a record of the
agenda in Lenin’s hand, notes on the sittings and speeches, and also a
draft resolution on the attitude of the Latvian Social-Democrats to the
R.S.D.L.P., an outline of the report and the summing-up speech. Of great
interest are Lenin’s notes on the speeches and his commentaries. There is,
for instance, a note on Braun’s speech

   

on January 15 (28), 1914. where Braun says, in justification of his
conciliatory stand, that it is “a very fine point”, Lenin writes: =

“That’s where it’s liable to break!”

A reference to the liquidators’ conference held in Vienna in August
1912; it formalised the anti-Party August bloc, which was organised by
Trotsky. It was attended by representatives of the Bund, the Transcaucasian
Regional Committee, the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory and
groups of liquidators, Trotskyites and otzovists abroad (the Editorial
Boards of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata and Trotsky’s Vienna
Pravda, and the Vperyod group). Delegates from Russia
were sent by the St. Petersburg and Moscow “initiating groups” of
liquidators, the Krasnoyarsk organisation, the Sebastopol Social-Democratic
Military Organisation, the Editorial Boards of the liquidators’
publications, Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos; it was also
attended by a representative of the Spilka Committee Abroad. The
overwhelming majority were resident abroad, were out of touch with the
working class in Russia, and not connected directly with local Party work
in Russia.  

The conference adopted anti-Party, liquidationist decisions on all
questions of Social-Democratic tactics and came out against the existence
of the illegal Party. The liquidators’ attempt to set up their own,
Centrist party in Russia was not supported by the workers. The liquidators
failed to elect a Central Committee and confined themselves to setting up
an Organising Committee. The anti-Bolshevik bloc, consisting a diverse
elements, which it was the main task of the conference to set up, began to
fail apart before the conference was over. See Lenin’s articles “The
Break-up of the ‘August’ Bloc”, “The ‘August’ Fiction Exposed”,
“Disruption of Unity Under Cover of Outcries for Unity”

(present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 158–61, 182–85, 325–47).

In view of the conditions of secrecy, a special section of the
C. C. shall be set up to provide direct guidance in illegal organisational
work.  
 

General meetings of the C.C. sections shall be held only in case of
emergency, with special precautions of secrecy and only by agreement
between the representatives of both sections. Ordinary relations shall be
conducted through individual authorised persons.  

The organisational section of the C.C. shall use the cover name of
Workers’ Co-operative Commission.  

This section shall 1) direct the work of the St. Petersburg Committee,
systematically helping it and restoring it in the event of arrests; 2) see
that the work of all legal organisations is connected on Party lines; 3)
find especially strict forms of secrecy to cover up illegal ties and
undertakings; 4) unite work on the all-Russia scale, with regular contacts
and visiting rounds; 5) take charge mainly, of preparing a party congress
for August
1914.{2} 

The organisational section shall be appointed by the Russian collegium
of the C.C. and shall consist of 3–5 persons with an equal or double
number of candidates.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Resolution on Setting up an Organisational Section of the Central
Committee to direct illegal work was adopted by the C.C. at its sittings
held in Cracow from April 2 to 4 (15 to 17), 1914, under Lenin’s direction
and with the participation of G. I. Petrovsky, representing the Bolshevik
Duma group, who had arrived from Russia. The C.C. examined the questions of
preparing for the convocation of the next R.S.D.L.P. congress, marking
Workers’ Press Day, work among the peasants, work in the Duma and report of
the Bolshevik Duma group, the International Women’s Conference, the Vienna
Congress of the Second International, preparation of leaflets for May Day,
etc.  

In connection with the discussion of the question of setting up the
Organisational Section of the Central Committee to direct illegal Work and
the adoption of a resolution on this question, Lenin proposed that
prominent Party workers—among them M. I. Kalinin and A. S. Kiselyov—and
workers who took an active part in the insurance movement should be
included in the Section. Apart from the resolution published here, there is
also an outline of the agenda of the C.C. sittings worked out by Lenin. On
the

   

question of the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. report to the Vienna Congress of the Second
International, the C.C. decided to “instruct the C.C. members abroad to
engage in drawing up the report”. This was done by Lenin. In April-May
1914, he wrote his “Plan and Outline for a Report of the
R.S.D.L.P. C.C. to the Vienna Congress of the Second International” (see
Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 25,
pp. 441–44).

{2}

The Party congress was to be timed to coincide with the
International Socialist Congress in Vienna, set for August 1914. An
Organising Commission was set up under the Russian Collegium of the C.C. to
prepare for the congress. It was also decided to set up commissions in
Moscow, the Caucasus, the South and the Urals. The congress was to be
preceded by organisational tours of local Party organisations by
C.C. agents, and also by trips to the localities 14 the Bolshevik deputies
to the Duma. The preparations for the congress were especially intensive in
the spring and summer of 1914. The Agenda and even the composition of the
congress were determined. It was to discuss the following questions: =

reports of the C.C. and reports from the localities, the political
situation, the Party’s organisational tasks, the tasks of the strike
movement, the tactics of the insurance movement, some addenda to the
minimum programme, the national question, the liquidators in connection
with the conference under the I.S.B., participation in the bourgeois press
and other urgent problems of the time. By the end of July 1914,
preparations for the congress and elections to the International Socialist
Congress were almost complete. Most of the delegates were elected, the
instructions drawn up and the mandates collected. The technical
side—secret meeting places, routes and passports—was also ready. But
the outbreak of war and the wild reaction that followed worked a sharp
change in the situation in the country. The closure of the frontiers cut
off communications with all other countries. The congress was postponed
until a more favourable moment. Nor was the International Congress able to
meet in these circumstances. Although the Party congress did not take
place, preparation for it had a great part to play in strengthening and
consolidating the Party organisations.

The recently published new statistical pamphlet by
Mr. Kozminykh-Lanin examines the question of overtime, which is of
exceptional importance for the Russian workers.  

Let us note that the statistical data given by Kozminykh Lanin relate
to the year of 1908 only and apply exclusively to workers of Moscow
Gubernia. Moreover, the 1908 figures must now be largely out of date,
especially in view of the fact that 1908 was a year of industrial
stagnation, and that it was followed by a year of industrial upswing, and a
parallel and intensified demand for manpower. This,

    

for its part, was bound to lead to greater use of overtime in a number of
industries.  

The data given by Kozminykh-Lanin (a factory inspector in Moscow
Gubernia) are undoubtedly of a semi-official character, they were collected
through an inquiry among the employers, so that they should be taken with a
grain of salt but must none the less be given the most serious
attention. For one thing, the literature on the question is so scarce in
Russia that every work must be made use of, quite apart from the fact that
even these semi-official statistics yield a great deal that is highly
interesting.  

Mr. Kozminykh-Lanin carried out his inquiry among a total of 112,380
workers in 152 enterprises of Moscow Gubernia, mainly large-scale ones,
with the textile industry being prevalent in the inquiry.  

The figures given in the pamphlet indicate that overtime is not widely
practised in the textile industry of the Moscow area. Thus, of the 59,000
workers engaged in the processing of cotton, covered by the inquiry, only
767 did overtime on holidays. Considerably greater numbers did overtime on
weekdays (1,717), but even there the figure fluctuates between 1 and
2 per cent of the total. That is understandable, because technical
requirements in the textile industry are such that at every given moment
there must be a definite number of hands specified more or less in advance;
and the main thing is that 1908 was less than favourable for the textile
industry. Employers were frequently concerned in cutting back production,
rather than in increasing the productivity of their enterprises through
overtime.  

The metalworking industry, another leading branch, presents a different
picture. There overtime is widely practised, sometimes involving up to 20
per cent of the total number of workers.  

As for the duration of overtime, according to Kozminykh-Lanin’s data,
it generally fluctuates both for metalworkers and textile workers between
25 and 35 hours per worker doing overtime (counting work on both weekdays
and holidays). This is a very high figure. The 30 hours of free time on
average taken up by overtime earning naturally add up entirely to so much
harm done to the worker’s cultural and mental development.  
 

Let us see what workers are paid for the plunder of their labour in
terms of brains, muscles and nerves.... Mr. Kozminykh-Lanin gives a very
detailed calculation of the per-hour remuneration of workers for overtime
in the several branches. We find that this work earns textile workers an
average of only 15-16 kopeks an hour, rarely more than that. These rates
are slightly increased towards April and September, and then decline again
to 13 kopeks in December-February. The earnings are especially small at
wool-weaving mills; thus, the average per-hour wage for March came to only
6.75 kopeks for Sunday and holiday work. If those are overtime rates, how
low the ordinary ones must be!  

The tables show that the labour of metalworkers is not much better paid
than that of textile workers; the average per-hour overtime earnings
fluctuate from 13 to 20 kopeks. In general, the level and change of rates
for the overtime work of Moscow metalworkers clearly show that the working
conditions there are highly unfavourable even in comparison with, say,
St. Petersburg.  

For all their overtime, Moscow workers are paid next to nothing.  

Thus, average monthly earnings for overtime were: 


 Textile workers 
 (kopeks) 


 Sundays and holidays . . {{ 
 compulsory 
 408 


 optional 
 221 


 Weekdays . . . . . . . . {{

 337 


 optional 
 184 


 Weekdays . . . . . . . . {{ 
 compulsory 
 325 


 optional 
 231 



Let us emphasise in conclusion that Mr. Kozminykh-Lanin’s inquiry dealt
little, if at all, with the main sphere of overtime—small-scale industry
(only 1.45 per cent of the workers covered by the inquiry were engaged in
under takings employing less than 100 persons). Yet, we feel

    

sure that the examination of working conditions in small-scale industry
would have produced some astounding results.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The statistical studies by I. M. Kozminykh-Lanin repeatedly drew
Lenin’s attention. In August 1912, Lenin wrote two reviews on his
Working Day and Working Year in Moscow Gubernia, entitled “The
Working Day in the Factories of Moscow Gubernia” and “The Working Day and
Working Year in Moscow Gubernia”. The first was published in
Pravda, the second in Nevskaya Zvezda in August 1912

(see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 260–61, 262-69).

Lenin used the author’s statistical data in his article “The Language of
Figures”, published in September 1913 in the Moscow newspaper Nash
Put

(see present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 358–63).

In the first of the above-mentioned reviews Lenin wrote that the
statistician had prepared a special work on overtime at Moscow Gubernia
factories, and the article given here is a review of this latter work,
which was published in 1914.

The C.C. expresses its gratitude to the C.C. delegation at the Brussels
=

conference{1} for its skilful and vigorous pursuit of the Party’s
line. The C.C. requests the collegium of delegates to elect one representative
to report at a congress or a conference of the R.S.D.L.P. in August 1914.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The conference, called by the Executive Committee of the I.S.B. in
accordance with the decision of the December 1913 session of the I.S.B.,
was held from July 16 to 18, 1914. It was attended by representatives of
the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks) Central Committee; the Organising Committee
(Mensheviks) with its affiliated organisations (Caucasian Regional
Committee and the Borba group [Trotskyites]); the
Social-Democratic Duma group (Mensheviks); Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo
group; the Vperyod group; the Bund; the Social-Democracy of the
Latvian Territory; the Social-Democracy of Lithuania; the Polish
Social-Democrats; the Polish Social-Democratic Opposition, and the
P.P.S.-Lewica. The delegation of the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. consisted of Inessa
Armand (Petrova), M. F. Vladimirsky (Kamsky) and I. F. Popov
(Pavlov). Lenin thoroughly prepared the delegation for the conference: he
wrote a report and detailed instructions for it, provided it with the
necessary material, documents and factual data which exposed the true face
of Russia’s opportunists and theft sponsors.  

From the outset there was a sharp struggle between the Bolsheviks and
the Russian and international opportunists. On Kautsky’s motion, the
conference approved the following agenda: =

1) Programme differences. 2) Tactical differences. 3) Organisational
question. Despite the fact that the conference was to be limited to an
exchange of opinion, Vandervelde warned that it would adopt decisions on
all three items of the agenda. The C.C. delegation, guided by Lenin’s
instructions, motioned that the conference should hear the delegations’
reports and suggestions concerning the concrete conditions which each
considered necessary to ensure unity. Thanks to the insistence of the
Bolsheviks it was decided to depart from the adopted agenda and to go on to
reports on the controversial questions and to the formulations of the
concrete conditions for unity.  

At the centre of the conference’s work was a report of the
R.S.D.L.P. C.C., prepared by Lenin and read out by Inessa Armand in French
at the morning sitting of July 17. The leaders of the I.S.B. did not allow
her to read out the entire report, so she had to summarise a part of it and
then go on to stating the terms for unity. Intent on defending the
liquidators, the I.S.B. leaders were greatly irritated at the concrete
proposals of the Bolsheviks on the terms for unity. On behalf of the
I.S.B., Kautsky motioned a resolution which asserted that there were no
essential differences among the Russian Social-Democrats hindering their
unity. He was supported by the O.C. and Plekhanov, who made fierce attacks
against the C.C. delegation and Lenin. An erroneous stand was taken by Rosa
Luxemburg, who joined Plekhanov, Vandervelde, Kautsky and others in urging
a union of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Since the motioning of the
resolution was outside the powers of the conference, the Bolsheviks and the
Latvian Social-Democrats refused to participate in the vote en it. But a
majority adopted the resolution. The Polish opposition, although it
supported the Bolsheviks and the Latvian Social-Democrats at the
conference, voted for the I.S.B. resolution.

   

(See Lenin’s article “The Polish Social-Democratic Opposition at the
Parting of the Ways”, present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 556–57.)



The Bolsheviks, guided by Lenin, refused to abide by the decisions of
the Brussels conference. The attempt on the part of the opportunist leaders
of the Second International to liquidate the Bolshevik Party was a failure,
in the face of the international proletariat, Lenin and the Bolsheviks
exposed the true aims of the leaders of the International parading as
peace-makers.  

At a private conference of liquidators, Trotskyites, Vperyod
supporters, Plekhanovites, Bundists and representatives of the Caucasian
Regional Organisation, held after the Brussels conference, these groups set
up a bloc against the Bolsheviks. The Brussels (July Third) bloc was a
hypocritical cover-up for the politically rotten positions of all its
participants; the bloc’s break

-no

soon after showed the falsity of the policy propounded by the Russian and
West-European “unifiers” of the R.S.D.L.P.

At the Brussels conference the Polish opposition headed by Malecki went over to
the liquidators. With these men deeds do not match words. Let us wait for the
results of their July 3 bloc with Alexinsky, Plekhanov and the
liquidators. Practice is the best test.

Notes
 
 



{1}

These plans reveal the content of the article “Revolution and War”,
which Lenin planned to write for No. 33 of the Party’s C.O., the newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat. The plans were written in July 1914, after the
outbreak of war between Austria and Serbia.  

The revolutionary crisis coming to a head in Russia on the eve of the
war was most evident in July 1914, a period Lenin compared with January
1905, pointing to the growth of a massive revolutionary movement, led by
the illegal proletarian party, the growth of slogans providing ideological
unity for the Party’s propaganda and agitation. The revolutionary struggle
was conducted under the slogans for an eight-hour working day, confiscation
of landed estates and a democratic republic.  

The plans show that the powerful growth of the revolutionary movement
in Russia was seen by Lenin in the context of the inter national situation,
and that in his article “Revolution and War” he intended to deal with the
tasks facing the proletariat of Russia in connection with the world
situation.

[45-DEGREE HASH.]

The only correct proletarian slogan is to transform the present imperialist
war into a civil war. This transformation flows from all the objective
  conditions of the current milita ry disaster, and only by systematically
  propagandising and agitating in t /t a t direction can the
  workers’ parties fulfil the obligations they undertook at
Basle.{2}


That is the only kind of tactics that will be truly revolu tiona.ry
working-class tactics, corresponding to the condi tions of the new historical
epoch.

[45-DEGREE HASH.]

 

Notes

This is written on a separate page and is marked as an insertion, but
there is no indication which particular article it belongs to. It may well
be a variant of the insertion to the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. manifesto “The War
and the Social-Democracy of Russia”, or to a Bolshevik resolution on the
war.

p. 337





{2}

A reference to the Extraordinary International Socialist Congress held
at Basle on November 24 and 25, 1912. It was called to decide on the
question of fighting the looming danger of an imperialist world war, a
danger: that was intensified by the outbreak of the First Balkan War. The
Congress was attended by 555 delegates. The R.S.D.L.P. C.C. sent
6 delegates. On the opening day, there was a massive anti-war demonstration
and an international rally against war.  

On November 25, the Congress unanimously adopted a Manifesto on war. It
warned the nations against the threat of an impending world war, exposed
the plunderous aims of the war being prepared by the imperialists, urged
workers in nil countries to wage a resolute struggle for peace, against the
threat of war, and to “confront capitalist imperialism with the might of
the international solidarity of the proletariat”. In the event of an
imperialist war, the Manifesto advised socialists to use the economic and
political crisis caused by the war to struggle for a socialist revolution.


The leaders of the Second International (Kautsky, Vandervelde and
others) voted for the Manifesto, but with the outbreak of the world war
they forgot all about the Baste Manifesto and the other decisions of
international socialist congresses on the struggle against war, and sided
with their imperialist governments.

1. Character of war: imperialism (as the main thing). Imperialism as the
   final stage in the development of capitalism.


2. National wars at the start of the bourgeois epoch vs.
→


[SQUIGGLE.]


National war: to consolidate the national territory as a base for the
development of capitalism, to sweep away the pre-capitalist remnants.

    


imperialist wars at the end of it.


[SQUIGGLE.]


Imperialist war: everyone already finds the sinking capitalist ship
overcrowded, and tries to push
the others aside and delay the
end of capitalism.


3. Long-standing (30–40 years) diplomatic preparation of the war: its
   “natural” and “expected” character (and “weaned their thoughts
   from”: Adler at the last sitting of the International Bureau {8}).


4. National war (Serbia) as a by-product of pre sent-day war.


5. Bourgeoisia’s use of national war tradition:

“La patrie”, {1}
Luzzatti.


6. “Country.” Quotation from the Communist
Manifesto. Its analysis.


7.



(α) The working men have no country.


(β) I n i t i a l l y within the framework of
the nation →


cf. the wars of 1790–1814, 1859, 1866, 1870.


[BOX ENDS:]


India’s present war or
one between China and
Japan ((eventuell{2}

))


(γ) and even then not in the bourgeois sense.


(δ) Emancipation is impossible without the joint efforts of the
proletarians.


(ε) Collapse of national partitions.




8. Attitude to this truth: opportunists’ defence of nationalism
   (Jaur˜s in L’Armée
nouvelle)...{9}

   (H. Wendel in Neue Zeit, 1914, N 19, S. 8 4 3;
for Jaurès).{10}


9. Vacillation in the International: defensive and offensive war or
   “standpoint of proletar ian interest”?

    

      
10. Quotations from old statements by Bebel and others, and silence about
    the 1912 resolution.


11. Basle Manifesto



(α) quotations from Stuttgart


(β) threat of civil war (1871 and 1905)


(γ) “crime”




12.



“Calamities of invasion” = sophism (Kautsky)....


“Tolstoyism” = idem.


“Practical question: victory or defeat for one’s own country” =
    sophism.{11}


All this boils down to the question of two camps.


Yes, but which two camps? Nations or classes?


What do the workers lose with their country? The “eternal” in country.


Country as a bourgeois state and its boundaries—country as language,
    territory, etc.




13. Practical attitude of socialists towards the present war:

Lenin began work on the pamphlet soon after his arrival in Berne. He
collected extensive material but the pamphlet was not written. He used some
of the preparatory material in his lectures, articles published in
Sotsial-Demokrat, and in the pamphlet Socialism and

Government of aggressive designs, and the German soldiers, of atrocities on
occupied territory. The Executive of the German Social-Democratic Party
published a protest against the

   

manifesto in No. 247 of Vorw\"arts on September 10. There followed

The resolution “The Tasks of Revolutionary Social-Democracy in the
European War”, adopted on Lenin’s report on the attitude to the war made
at a Bolshevik conference in Berne on September 6, 1914. It is known as
“Theses on War”, and was the first document to define the attitude of the
Bolshevik Party and international revolutionary Social-Democracy to the
imperialist world war. Lenin’s theses were discussed in detail and adopted
as the resolution of the conference. Signed “Group of Social-Democrats,
Members of the R.S.D.L.P.”, they were circulated to various Bolshevik

Every class-conscious worker will feel a pang when he sees Gorky’s
signature alongside that of P. Struve under the chauvinistic-clerical protest
against German
barbarity.{1}


In a talk we once had about Chaliapin’s genuflections, Gorky said:
“You can’t judge him too strictly; we artists have a different
mentality.” In other words, the artist frequently acts under the influence
of his emotion, which attains such a force that it suppresses all other
considerations.


Let that be so. Let us say that Chaliapin must not be strictly judged. He is an
artist, and nothing more. He is a stranger to the cause of the proletariat:
today, he is a friend of the workers, tomorrow, a reactionary, moved by his
emotion.


But the workers have grown accustomed to regard Gorky as their own. They have
always believed that his heart beats as warmly as theirs for the cause of the
proletariat, and that he has dedicated his talent to the service of this cause.


That is why they keep sending messages of greetings to Gorky, and that is why
his name is so dear to them. It is this trust on the part of the class-conscious
workers that imposes on Gorky a certain duty—to cherish his good
name and to refrain from putting his signature to all sorts of cheap chauvinist
protests which could well confuse the workers who lack political
consciousness. They are still unable to find their bearings in many situations,
and could be led astray by Gorky’s name. Struve’s name will not
confuse any worker, but Gorky’s may.

 

Therefore, the class-conscious workers, who well realise the falsehood and the
vulgarity of this hypocritical protest against the “German
barbarians”, must feel that they have to rebuke the author of The Song
of the Falcon. They will tell him: “At this hard and responsible
moment through which the proletariat of Russia is going, we expected you to go
hand in hand with its leading fighters and not with Mr. Struve & Co.!”

The above article has been written by a prominent sup porter of the
Dzvin
trend.{1} Just recently, we have had to engage in
some sharp polemics with that trend. We still have some differences with its
writers. We do not regard as correct the concessions they have made to
nationalism; we believe the idea of “cultural-national autonomy” to
be bourgeois nationalism; we do not think that the best way to organise the
proletariat is to break it up into national curias, and we do
not share their views of the distinctions between “anational”,
national and international. Being advocates of consistent
  i n t e r n a t i o n a l i s m,  we entertain the hope that
the author of this article and his
friends will learn the necessary lessons from the events of the European war.


At any rate, we are happy to note that precisely at this hard moment the said
group of Ukrainian leaders are most aware of their propinquity with
Sotsial-Demokrat. It is to their credit that they have succeeded in
separating them selves from the notorious “Alliance for the Liberation of
the
Ukraine”,{2} whose activity has nothing in common with
Social-Democracy.

nationalists in 1914, after the start of the First World War. Expecting the
defeat of tsarist Russia in the war, the alliance set itself the task of
securing Ukraine’s secession from Russia and establishing a bourgeois and
landowner autocratic Ukrainian state under the German protectorate.

3. Expressing full sympathy with the idea of further increasing the
frequency of the C.O.’s publication, and establishing a popular daily under
the C.O. Editorial Board, the conference considers it possible to start the
new publication after the main task—the correct organisation of the
C.O.—has been secured.  

The conference urges all comrades abroad to start working vigorously at
once in that direction, calling especially for more systematic support of
the C.O. with literary material in connection with the organisation of
contributors’ conferences, etc.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The item was raised at the conference of the R.S.D.L.P. sections
abroad, at Borne, in connection with the attempt on the part of some
R.S.D.L.P. organisations abroad (the Baugy group, the Paris section) to
start publication of local newspapers separately from the Central Organ. In
the conditions of wartime and in view of the great scarcity of funds and
literary forces, the need for closer contacts between Bolsheviks and joint
discussion of important questions, Lenin considered it inappropriate to
publish small local papers, and motioned an amendment to point 3 of the
draft resolution on the question, which was put up for debate at the
conference. Lenin’s motion was carried and the conference adopted point 3
in his wording (see K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh..., Part I, p. 331).

The current world war, which is the cause of so much
distress wherever it has broken out, which has devastated and ruined
Belgium and Galicia, and which has ruined the lives of thousands upon
thousands of workers—this war is an imperialist one, caused by the
struggle between the ruling classes of various countries for a division of
the colonies and domination of the world market, and by dynastic
Interests. It is a natural continuation of the policy conducted by the
class of capitalists and the governments of all countries,

    

and that is why the question of who struck out first is altogether
irrelevant from the socialist standpoint.  

This war, far from serving any interests of the workers, is in fact a
weapon in the hands of the ruling classes for disrupting the international
solidarity of the workers and weakening their movement and class struggle
in each country. Similarly, the “defend your country” watchword, put
forward by the bourgeoisie and supported by the opportunists, is nothing
but a bait to which the bourgeoisie hopes the proletariat will rise and be
induced to give their life and blood for its interests.  

In view of all this, the Extraordinary International Socialist Women’s
Conference, on the strength of the Stuttgart resolution, which recommends
the use of the economic and political crisis, brought about by the war, for
rousing the people to accelerate the collapse of the capitalist system, on
the strength of the Copenhagen resolution, which says that it is the duty
of deputies to vote against war credits, and of the Basle resolution, which
says that the workers consider it a crime to shoot down each
other—declares that the representatives of most of the socialist parties
of the belligerent countries acted in complete discord with these
resolutions and, succumbing to the pressure of circumstances, committed a
real betrayal in respect of socialism, sup planting it with nationalism; it
insists that the proletarians of all countries have no enemy other than
their class enemy—the class of capitalists.  

The horrible suffering caused by this war awakens in all women,
especially proletarian women, a growing desire for peace. Declaring war
on all imperialist war, the conference at the same time believes that
if this desire for peace is to be transformed into a conscious
political force, working women must well realise that the propertied
classes are striving for nothing but annexations, conquest and
domination, that in the epoch of imperialism wars are inevitable, and that
imperialism threatens the world with a series of wars, unless the
proletariat musters enough strength to put an end to the capitalist
system by the final overthrow of capitalism. Every working woman who
wants to shorten the period of suffering connected with the epoch of
imperialist wars, must strive to have her urge for peace develop into
indignation
    

and struggle for socialism. The working woman will attain her
aim in this struggle only through a revolutionary mass movement,
and a strengthening and sharpening of the socialist
struggle. Consequently, her first duty is to support the trade union
and socialist organisations and break the civil peace by fighting against
the war credits, against entry into bourgeois ministries, by supporting and
spreading the idea of soldiers’ fraternisation in the trenches on the field
of battle, by setting up illegal organisations wherever the government has
abolished the constitutional freedoms, and finally, by drawing the mass
into manifestations and revolutionary movements.  

The International Socialist Women’s Conference calls on the working
women of all countries to start this struggle right away, organising it on
an international scale, and closely tying in their work with that of the
socialists of all countries who, like Liebknecht, are lighting against
nationalism and waging a revolutionary socialist struggle.  

At the same time, the conference gives working women a reminder that in
the most advanced countries of Europe the objective conditions for
socialist production are already there, that the whole movement is entering
a new phase, that the current world war imposes fresh and serious duties
upon them, and that their movement may be the forerunner of a general mass
action which could give fresh scope to the whole socialist movement and
advance the hour of final emancipation. By taking the initiative in staging
demonstrations and revolutionary manifestations, working women, marching
hand in hand with the proletarians, could usher in a new era of proletarian
struggle in the course of which the proletariat will win socialism in the
more advanced countries, and a democratic republic in the more backward
ones.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The International Socialist Women’s Conference was held at
Borne from March 26 to 28, 1915. It was called on the initiative of the
magazine Rabotnitsa’s organisation abroad with the close
participation of Clara Zetkin, who was at the time Chairman of the
International Socialist Women’s Bureau. All the preparatory work for the
conference was carried out by I. F. Armand, N. K. Krupskaya and others
under Lenin’s direction. The conference was attended by 29 delegates from
women’s organisations of Britain, Germany, Holland, France, Poland, Russia
and Switzerland. The seven delegates from Russia included four from the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee (Armand, Krupskaya and others) and three from
the O.C. Most of the delegates to the conference were under the influence
of the Centrists, which is why instead of discussing general socialist
tasks in connection with the, war, the conference confined its work to
discussing Clara Zetkin’s report “On Socialist Women’s International
Action for Peace”. The resolution on this question was worked out by Clara
Zetkin with the participation of delegates from Britain and Holland and was
of a Centrist character. The representatives of the R.S.D.L.P. Central
Committee motioned a draft resolution written by Lenin, which indicated to
the socialist women the revolutionary way of fighting against the war and
international opportunism. Inessa Armand spoke for the draft at the
conference, which however adopted the resolution drawn up by Clara Zetkin.


Lenin assessed the conference as an attempt to restore international
ties and tried to use it for the purpose of rallying the internationalist
elements on a revolutionary platform. But, as he pointed out later, this
and other conferences of internationalists held at the time, while being
inspired by the best intentions, did not lay down a militant
internationalist line..., “they confined themselves

   

to repeating the old resolutions” and “at best were marking
time”

(see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 325).



The material on the International Socialist Women’s Conference was
published in a Supplement to Sotsial-Demokrat No. 42 on June 1,
1915.

VARIANT OF THE DRAFT RESOLUTION OF LEFT-WING SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS FOR THE FIRST
INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCE

Draft 

The present war springs from imperialism, i.e., the highest stage of
capitalism, when the development of the productive forces and the growth of
capital have gone beyond the narrow framework of separate national states,
and induce the “great” powers to try to enslave other nations and seize
colonies as sources of raw materials and areas for the export of capital.


The objective conditions are quite ripe for socialism and the great
powers are fighting the current war in an effort artificially to delay the
collapse of capitalism, by preserving and intensifying the dependence of
colonies, by seizing privileges on the world market, and by splitting and
sup pressing the international revolutionary struggle of the workers.  

Social-Democrats fully recognise the necessity of freedom for all
nations. In the epoch of struggle against feudalism, absolutism and foreign
national oppression, they recognised defence of one’s country—today they
recognise as just the war waged by the oppressed nations (especially
colonies) against their oppressors, the “great” powers.  

But the current war between the great powers is a war between
slave-owners to intensify and consolidate slavery, for a redivision of the
colonies, for the “right” to oppress other nations, for the privileges of
great-power capital and for the reactionary suppression of the
working-class movement. That is why talk about “defence of one’s country”
on the part of both belligerent groups of powers is a bourgeois swindle of
the people. Neither the victory by any of the present governments, nor the
status quo ante helium

    

can safeguard the freedom of nations from the imperialist great powers, nor can
it give the possibility of a decent life to the working class, which is
      being increasingly weighed down by the high cost of living, the trusts,
      militarism and its attendant political reaction, even in the freest
      countries.


The real meaning of the “defend your country” slogan in this war is
defence of the great-power privileges and advantages, defence of the
“right” of the given bourgeoisie to oppress other nations, it is a
national-liberal labour policy, an alliance between a small section of the
workers and their “own” national bourgeoisie against the mass of
proletarians and the exploited. Socialists conducting such a policy are in fact
chauvinists—social-chauvinists. The policy of voting for war credits,
entering ministries,
Burgfrieden,{1}

etc., is a policy of opportunism and betrayal
of socialism. The working class cannot attain its great aim of labour
emancipation, without carrying on a resolute struggle against opportunism and
social-chauvinism.


The Basle Manifesto of 1912, adopted unanimously in anticipation of precisely
the kind of war between the great powers which has in fact come about,
definitely recognised the reactionary and imperialist character of the war, and
clearly announced the approach of a proletarian revolution in
connection with such a war. In effect, the war has created a revolutionary
situation, and has generated revolutionary sentiments and discontent. It is the
task of Social-Democrats to maintain and develop these, help to clear the
revolutionary awareness of the masses and purge their minds of the falsehood of
bourgeois and socialist chauvinism, promote every effort at revolutionary mass
struggle against imperialism, for socialism, and to work to transform the
imperialist war into a civil war for socialism.


To intensify their revolutionary agitation, Social-Democrats must make use of
the growing massive desire for peace, which expresses the disappointment of the
masses and the clearing of their revolutionary consciousness. But in so doing,
Social-Democrats should not deceive the people by holding out hopes for any kind
of stable democratic

    

peace, that would rule out the oppression of nations, and that would come
soon and without the revolutionary over throw of the present governments.

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE MANIFESTO AND THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE WAR AND
THE TASKS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY


AUGUST 25 (SEPTEMBER 7) 
1

It was inevitable that things here should have come to a struggle of opinion
between Ledebour and
us.{8} However, I must protest against the
method used here by Ledebour in attacking Radek. The assertion that our
manifesto has been signed only by men who are safe is inadmissible. It has also
been signed by the Latvian delegates and Borchardt. Another old and hackneyed
argument is saying that one should not call the masses to revolutionary action
unless one is able to take a direct part in it oneself. Further more, I deny
that there should be no mention of the means of struggle. That has occurred in
all revolutionary periods. The means should be made known to the masses so that
they could be explained and discussed. We in Russia have always acted in this
way; in fact, the interpretation of the means of struggle had been the subject
of arguments between Plekhanov and myself even in the pre-revolutionary
years. When the objective historical situation of 1847 confronted

    

Germany with revolution, Marx and Engels sent out an appeal from London
calling for
violence.{9} The German movement is faced with a decision. If we are
indeed on the threshold of a revolutionary epoch in which the masses will
go over to revolutionary struggle, we must also make mention of the means
necessary for this struggle. According to the revisionist view taken by
David and others, that is naturally something quite useless: after all,
they do not believe that we are on the eve of a revolutionary epoch. We who
believe this must act otherwise. You cannot make revolution without
explaining revolutionary tactics. It was precisely the worst feature of the
Second International that it constantly avoided explanations; and it is
that which the Dutch
Tribune-Marxists{10} quite correctly called the German Centre’s
“passive revolutionary attitude”.  

Now on the question of persecutions. You in Germany should in general
do more than legal work, if you want real action. You must combine legal
and illegal activity. The old methods are no longer adequate to the new
situation. You yourselves have said: we are going forward to an epoch of
great class battles. In that case, you must also have the means for
this. And it is not at all necessary for the manifesto to be signed, it
could well be issued without signatures. At any rate, you should not act
semi-legally, like Clara Zetkin, for instance. That calls for too much
sacrifice.  

Here is how things stand: either a truly revolutionary struggle or mere
empty talk which will help no one but the deserters, against whom
Liebknecht speaks out so sharply in this
letter.{11} Coming out for peace does not mean much in itself. David
also writes: we are not for the war, but only against defeat. Everyone
wants peace. Taking account of the new situation, we should use new and
specific means of struggle which should not be similar in any way to the
old German or Russian methods.  
2

I do not agree with Serrati that the resolution will appear either too
early or too
late.{12} After this war, other, mainly colonial, wars will be
waged. Unless the proletariat turns off the social-imperialist way,
proletarian solidarity will

    

be completely destroyed; that is why we must determine common tactics. If
we adopt only a manifesto, Vandervelde, L’Humanité and
others will once again start deceiving the masses; they will keep saying
that they, too, oppose war and want peace. The old vagueness will remain.

 No. 2. 

   We vote for, in particular, because two French
   comrades have put forward an important consideration. It is they who
   have pointed to the exceptionally
   oppressed condition of the workers in France, their
   extreme corruption by revolutionary phrase-mongering, and the need for a
   slow and cautious transition to resolute tactics. But in Europe as a
   whole it is opportunism that is the enemy of the working-class movement.

The First International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald
(Switzerland) was held from September 5 to 8, 1915.  

It was attended by 38 delegates from 11 European countries. Most
delegates took a Centrist stand. It discussed the following questions: 1)
reports by representatives of the various countries; 2) joint declaration
by representatives of Germany and France; 3) proposal by the Zimmerwald
Left on the adoption of a resolution of principle; 4) adoption of a
manifesto; 5) elections to the International Socialist Committee; 6)
adoption of a resolution voicing sympathy for the victims of the war and
the persecuted.  

Lenin took an active part in the work of the Conference: he made
speeches, sent notes to delegates during the sittings and spoke to them
during the recesses. Before the Conference, he carried out extensive
preparatory work in rallying the Left wing against the social-chauvinists
and the Centrists. On the eve of the Zimmerwald Conference, between
September 2 and 4, there was a meeting of Russian and Polish delegates to
discuss a “Draft Resolution Proposed by the Left Wing at Zimmerwald”
which was written by Lenin, and a draft resolution motioned by Karl Radek
which Lenin had criticised before the meeting. After the discussion it was
decided to motion at the Zimmerwald Conference Radek a draft corrected on
the basis of Lenin’s remarks. The draft resolution and the draft manifesto
written by Lenin condemned social-chauvinism and Centrism, raised the
question of rejecting the slogans: “defend your country” in the
imperialist war and a “civil peace”, and pointed to the need for the
propaganda of revolutionary action.  

A majority at the Conference rejected the draft resolution on the war
and the tasks of Social-Democrats and the draft manifesto motioned by the
Left wing. However, the appeal “To the Proletarians of Europe” adopted by
the Conference contained, thanks to Lenin’s insistence, a number of basic
propositions of revolutionary Marxism.  

Lenin’s “Draft Resolution Proposed by the Left Wing at Zimmerwald”,
his articles “The First Step” and “Revolutionary Marxists at the
International Socialist Conference of September 5–8, 1915”, in which
Lenin assesses the Zimmerwald Conference, are published in Vol. 21 of the
present edition, pp. 345–48, 383–88, 389–93.  

The proceedings of the Zimmerwald and the Kienthal conferences from
which Lenin’s speeches published in this volume have been taken, were
received by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee from the International Institute of Social History at Amsterdam
in 1964. Some minor remarks by Lenin are not included in the volume.

These are theses for a report on the character of the First World War
and the tactics of revolutionary internationalists, which Lenin gave at a
private meeting of Left-wing Social-Democratic delegates at the Zimmerwald
Conference on September 4, 1915, before the Conference opened. It was also
attended by some other delegates. The meeting adopted the draft manifesto
and the draft resolution motioned by the Left wing at the Zimmerwald
Conference.

A reference to the Vorkonferenz, a preliminary conference, on the
question of convening an international socialist conference, held at Berne
on July 11, 1915. It was called on the initiative of the Italian and Swiss
socialists, and was attended by representatives of the R.S.D.L.P. Central
Committee, the Regional Executive of the Polish Social-Democratic Party,
the P.P.S.-Lewica and the O.C. of the Mensheviks. Most of those attending
were Centrists. The main question was the composition of the Forthcoming
First International Socialist Conference. The Kautskian majority of the
Vorkonferenz tried to get the Centrists led by Kautsky and even avowed
social-chauvinists, Troelstra and Branting, to attend the conference. The
representative of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee motioned a proposal that
invitation to attend the next preliminary conference should be sent out to
representatives of real Left-wingers in the international working-class
movement, who had by then separated themselves from the official parties in
most countries (the Dutch Left, the Bulgarian Tesnyaki, the Left-wing
opposition in the Swedish and the Norwegian Social-Democratic parties, the
group of German Left-wingers—Inter national Socialists of Germany, the
Polish Social-Democrats [opposition] and the Latvian Social-Democrats). But
the Kautskian majority at the conference rejected the proposal. The
preliminary conference adopted a decision to cell the second Vorkonferenz
which was to take the final decision on the conference. But it was not
held, the Zimmerwald Conference being convened instead.

p. 351





{8}

In the discussion of the draft manifesto and the draft resolution on
the war and the tasks of Social-Democrats, motioned on behalf of the
Zimmerwald Left by Karl Radek, a sharp struggle flared up at the Conference
between the revolutionary internationalists led by Lenin and the Kautskian
majority led by the German Social-Democrat G. Ledebour. Opposing these
documents, Ledebour and the Swiss Social-Democrat R. Grimm declared that,
in putting forward concrete demands for revolutionary action, the draft
manifesto and resolution motioned by the Left gave away the tactical
measures of revolutionary Social-Democracy to the enemy. They said that
people who signed these documents and spread their ideas in the belligerent
countries could be subjected to reprisals.

Engels, Selected Works, Vol. I, Moscow, 1962, pp. 21–65).

The Tribunists—members of the Social-Democratic Party of
Holland, whose organ was the newspaper De Tribune. Their leaders
were D. Wijnkoop, H. Gorter, A. Pannekoek and Henriette Roland-Holst. They
were not consistent revolutionaries but represented the Left wing of the
labour movement in Holland, and during the First World War mainly took an
internationalist stand. In 1918, they set up the Communist Party of
Holland.

p. 354





{11}

A reference to Karl Liebknecht’s letter of September 2, 1915, to the
International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald. He could not take part in
the Conference, because he had been drafted into the German army in early
1915. In his letter he opposed “civil peace” and called for a civil war
against the bourgeoisie, for the international solidarity of socialists of
all the belligerent countries, S or a struggle against the imperialist war
and a break with the social-chauvinists.

p. 354





{12}

In his speech, the Italian Socialist Party delegate G. Serrati declared
that the resolution on the war and the tasks of Social-Democrats, motioned
by the Left, was either premature or belated, because the war was already
on and it had been impossible to prevent its outbreak.

The addenda were not included in the final text of the statement read
out at the Conference in which the Zimmerwald Left motivated its voting for
the official manifesto.

German Social-Democracy was the strongest and most influential party of
the Second International. That is why, on the one hand, it bears the
greatest responsibility for its

    

collapse, and on the other, its example and experience are most
important for studying the reasons of this collapse and for analysing
the measures, ways and means for fighting the opportunism which has
strangulated that party.  

The opportunism which has strangulated the Social-Democratic Party of
Germany and has transformed that party into a national-liberal labour
party, has crystallised as social-chauvinism in the 1914–15 war.

Subject: not an assessment of the war

(>1 year ago and outdated), but (two) basic lines
in the develop ment of the working-class movement and socialism.

 





A l i a s:  

not an assessment of the war or tactical

  p r i n c i p l e s,

but an assessment of the course the
 working-class movement has taken.

Accordingly, the main thing: facts (on a broad scale) of the working-class
movement and socialism, and comparison of various countries.

Lenin gave a lecture on the subject of “Two Internationals” in Zurich
on February 4 (17), 1916. He gave the same lecture under a slightly changed
name, “Two Trends in the International Working-Class Movement”, in
Lausanne between May 19 and 21 (June 1 and 3) and in Geneva on May 20
(June 2).  

The manuscript of the plan for the lecture, which is at the Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee, also reflects Lenin’s preparation for the second lecture in
Lausanne and Geneva. In connection with the new data available after the
Second International Socialist Conference at Kienthal, Lenin made
additions, crossed out some points and changed their numeration. All the
changes made by Lenin in the plan are indicated in the footnotes.

{17}

A reference to the report by Henriette Roland-Holst in “Beilage zur
Berner Tagwacht” (Supplement to the Berne Sentinel)
No. 18 of January 22, 1916, concerning the speech by the Secretary of the
International Socialist Bureau, C. Huysmans, at the Extraordinary Congress
of the Social-Democratic Party of Holland on January 8-9; Huysmans also
spoke at Rotterdam on February 2. He was opposed by the Left
internationalist D. Wijnkoop, who said that since Huysmans had voted, for
the war credits, socialists could no longer regard him as Secretary of the
International Socialist Bureau. “We shall set up another International,”
said Wijnkoop.  


At the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism–Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee there is a cutting from “Beilage zur
Berner Tagwacht” No. 18 of January 22, 1916, with Lenin’s
markings; on Huysmans’s speech at Rotterdam, Lenin made an extract from
L’Humanité of February 9, 1916. Both documents were
published in 1931 in Lenin Miscellany XVII.  

Berner Tagwacht (Berne Sentinel)—an organ of the
Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland, published in Berne since 1893. From
1909 to 1918, it was edited by R. Grimm. At the beginning of the First
World War, it carried articles by K. Liebknecht, F. Mehring and other
Left-wing Social-Democrats. From 1917 on, the newspaper openly supported
the social-chauvinists. At the present time, the paper takes the same stand
on the main domestic and foreign policy issues as the bourgeois press.

p. 358





{18}

A reference to the editorial article in No. 43 of Avanti! of
February 12, 1916, “Intorno all’organizzazione socialista internazionale”
(Around the Socialist International). The Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee has Lenin’s
extracts from this article with his remarks.  

Avanti! (Forward!)—a daily, the Central Organ of the Italian
Socialist Party, founded in Rome in December 1896. During the First World
War, the paper took an inconsistent internationalist stand without breaking
up with the reformists. In 1926, it was closed down by Mussolini’s fascist
government, but continued irregular publications abroad; resumed
publication in Italy in 1943.

p. 358





{19}

A possible reference to reports from Paris about the Congress of the
French Socialist Party of December 25-29, 1915, published in No. 52 of
The Labour Leader on December 30, 1915, and in Nos. 2 and 4 on
January 13 and 27, 1916.  

The Labour Leader—a weekly published since 1891. From 1893,
organ of the Independent Labour Party of Britain. From 1922, it was
published under the name of New Leader; and since 1946, carries
the name of Socialist Leader.

p. 359





{20}

The Labour Party of Britain was founded in 1900 as an
association of trade unions, socialist organisations and groups to seat
labour representatives in Parliament (the Labour Representation
Committee). In 1906, the Committee took the name of Labour Party. Trade
union members are automatically members of the Labour Party provided they
pay party dues. The Labour Party is headed by an Executive Committee which
together with the General Trades Union Council and the Executive of the
Co-operative Party makes up the National Labour Council. Closely allied to
the Labour Party are the Co-operative Party, which is a collective member,
and the Independent Labour Party.  

The Labour Party, which was initially a party of workers (many members
of the petty bourgeoisie joined the party later), is opportunist in
ideology and tactics. During the First World War its leaders took a
social-chauvinist stand.  


The Labourites have repeatedly formed governments (1924, 1929, 1945 and
1950), which conducted the policy of British imperialism. The
dissatisfaction of the British working people with the reactionary policy
of the Labour Party leadership has resulted in the formation of a Left-wing
trend in the party aimed against the official policy of its leadership.

p. 358





{21}

Forward—a newspaper published in Glasgow since 1906. During
the First World War it supported the policy of the Independent Labour Party
of Britain. It was banned by the authorities after it carried a report on
the so-called 1915 “Christmas events” in Glasgow (the centre on the Clyde
area and of the shop stewards’ movement), when Lloyd George, at the time
Minister of Munitions, was shouted down by workers, who then staged an
impressive demonstration in the heart of the city carrying anti-war and
anti-government slogans.  

They threatened to strike and the ban on the paper was lifted.

p. 359





{22}

Merthyr—a district in Southern Wales. Lenin apparently
refers to the by-elections in the district, when the representative of the
British Socialist Party mustered the votes of the Liberals and the
Conservatives against the candidate of the Independent Labour Party. No. 46
of The Labour Leader of November 18, 1915, carried a report on the
electoral struggle in Merthyr.

p. 359





{23}

An apparent reference to the newspaper The Socialist, the
official organ of the Socialist Labour Party of Britain, published in
Glasgow in 1904, 1909–10, 1916, 1918–23.

p. 359





{24}

Nashe Slovo (Our Word)—a Menshevik-Trotskyite newspaper
published in Paris from January 1915 to September 1916, in place of
Golos.

p. 359





{25}

A possible reference to the report in the form of an appeal, “Die
Internationalen in Oesterreich an die Internationalen aller L\"ander” (The
Internationalists of Austria to the Internationalists of All Countries),
carried in “Beilage zur Darner Tagwacht” Nos. 283 and 284 on
December 3 and 4, 1915.

p. 361





{26}

A reference to Eugene Debs’s articles “When I Shall Fight”,
“\thinspace‘Preparedness’ I Favour”, “The Only War I Will Fight in” and
“Never Be a Soldier”, published in the newspaper Appeal to
Reason on August 25, September 11, December 11 and 25, 1915
(Nos. 1032, 1045 and 1047).  

Cuttings from Appeal to Reason with Lenin’s markings are at the
Central Party Archives of the institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee.

p. 381





{27}

Nashe Dyelo (Our Cause)—a Menshevik liquidator monthly,
first published in January 1915 in place of Nasha Zarya, which was
closed down in October 1914. Nashe Dyelo was the man organ of the
social-chauvinists in Russia, and had contributions from Y. Mayevsky,
P. P. Maslov, A. N. Potresov and N. Cherevanin, among others. There were
six issues.

p. 360





{28}

Nash Golos (Our Voice)—a legal Menshevik newspaper published
in Samara in 1915-16; it took a social-chauvinist stand.

p. 360





{29}

Rabocheye Utro (The Workers’ Morning)—a legal Menshevik
paper published in Petrograd from October to December 1915 in succession to
Utro which appeared in August 1915. The newspaper used
internationalist phrases to cover up its social-chauvinism and defencism.

p. 360





{30}

“Khvostov labour party”—named after A. N. Khvostov,
Minister for the Interior and Chief of the special gendarme corps in 1915
and 1916. In the manuscript Lenin wrote the word “Stolypin” over the word
“Khvostov”.

p. 381





{31}

“Europa und die Revolution” (Europe and Revolution)—the
title of an editorial item carried in No. 35 of Volksrecht en
February 11, 1916, in connection with an article signed I. S. in the
Lucerne chauvinist newspaper Vaterland, whose author said that the
continuation of the war could cause revolution which was more dangerous
“for the throne and the altar” than the war itself. An extract made by
Lenin from Volksrecht with his remarks is at the Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee.

p. 361





{32}

Lenin is comparing the voting against the war credits by the 20
Social-Democratic deputies of the German Reichstag on December 21, 1915,
and the voting on March 20, 1915, when only two (Karl Liebknecht and Otto
R\"uhle) voted against the war credits. The voting of 20 deputies against
the war credits testified to rowing pressure from the masses on the
leadership of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany and its Reichstag
group. However, the majority of the C.C. (Vorstand) and of the Reich stag
group censured the December 21 vote as a breach of party discipline.  

Speaking of the inconsistency of the 20, Lenin is referring to a
statement made by F. Geyer on behalf of the members of the
Social-Democratic group who had voted against the war credits on
December 21, which gave no characteristic of the war as imperialist, made
no mention of proletarian internationalism, and assumed that German plans
of conquest were of a very recent development.

p. 360





{33}

Lichtstrahlen (Rays of Light)—a monthly, organ of the group
of Left-wing Social-Democrats of Germany (Internationale Sons listen
Deutschlands), published under the editorship of J. Borchardt. It was
published in Berlin with interruptions from 1913 to 1921. Among those who
took part in the magazine were A. Pannekoek and A. Balabanova.

p. 362





{34}

No. 11 of Vorw\"arts of January 12, 1910, carried a statement
by Otto R\"uhle, “Zur Parteispaltung” (On the Party Split), In which he
said a split in the Social-Democratic Party of Germany was inevitable, The
editors of Vorw\"arts said in the editorial that although the
article was being published verbatim, they believed

   

that the controversial questions raised in it were not only premature, but
altogether irrelevant.

p. 362





{35}

A reference to the May Day demonstration and a strike by the young
workers of Brunswick in early May 1916. The strike was staged in protest
against the government’s deduction of part of the young workers’ wages for
a war loan. More than 1,500 men took part in the strike and the
demonstration. Following a stubborn struggle, the government was forced to
rescind its order on deductions on May 5, 1916.

p. 363





{36}

A reference to E. Vaillant’s editorial article “Formalistes
doctrinaires” (Doctrinaire Formalists) in L’Humanité
No. 3827 on October 9, 1914, in which Vaillant, who went over to
social-chauvinist positions at the very beginning of the war, was forced to
admit that he was receiving letters from French socialists protesting
against the policy of the French Socialist Party leadership. Lenin’s
extracts from Vaillant’s article are in Lenin Miscellany XIV,
p. 97.

p. 362





{37}

A reference to the appeal “To the Women of the Proletariat”, signed
by Louise Saumoneau on behalf of the French Socialist Women’s Action
Committee calling for the struggle for peace and against chauvinism. A copy
of the appeal with Lenin’s markings is at the Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee.

p. 363





{38}

The New Statesman—a weekly of the Fabian Society, founded in
London in 1913. Since 1931, it has been published under the name of The
New Statesman and Nation. At present, it expresses the views of the
Labour Party’s Left wing.

p. 362





{39}

A possible reference to the approval of the Zimmerwald Manifesto by the
Executive Committee of the British Socialist Party. At the end of 1915, it
decided to poll local organisations about adhering to Zimmerwald; an
overwhelming majority of local party organisations came out in favour of
adherence. A report on the poll was published in the
I.S.O. Bulletin No. 3 of February 29, 1916.

p. 362





{40}

A reference to the walk-out of H. Hyndman and his supporters from the
annual conference of the British Socialist Party held at Salford on
April 23 and 24, 1916. The conference marked the break-away of the British
Socialist Party from the social-chauvinists. The conference adopted a
number of anti-war resolutions of a general democratic character and a
resolution urging the use of the party’s full influence to put an end to
the war. By an overwhelming majority, the conference adopted a resolution
saying that the socialists recognise only a class war. In early June 1916,
Hyndman set up the National Socialist Party which in 1918 took the name of
the Social-Democratic Federation.

p. 363





{41}

A reference to the speech of C. Trèves in the Italian Chamber of
Deputies on December 2, 1915. A report on the speech was published in
Avanti! No. 335 on December 3, 1915.

p. 362





{42}

Tesnyaki—a revolutionary trend in the Bulgarian
Social-Democratic Party, which took shape in 1903 as an independent
Bulgarian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The founder and leader of the
Tesnyaki was D. Blagoev. He was succeeded by his followers G. Dimitrov,
V. Kolarov and others. From 1914 to 1918, the Tesnyaki opposed the
imperialist war. In 1919, they joined the Communist International and set
up the Communist Party of Bulgaria.

p. 362





{43}

Tribune, De Tribune—a newspaper founded in 1907 by
the Left wing of the Dutch Social-Democratic Labour Party. In 1909,
following the expulsion of the Left-wingers from the party and their
establishment of the Social-Democratic Party of Holland, it became the
organ of the latter. From 1918, it was the organ of the Dutch Communist
Party, published under the name until 1937.

p. 362





{44}

A possible reference to the items by

E. Pernerstorfer, 

“Russland und wir” (Russia and We) and “Nochmals Russland und wir”
(Once again Russia and We), published in Nos. 13 and 20 of Die Neue
Zeit on December 24, 1915, and February 11, 1916.

p. 364





{45}

A reference to the article “Die Stellung der Sozialdemokraten
Australiens zum Krieg” (The Attitude of Australian Social-Democrats to the
War) published under the initials J.K. in “Beilage zur Berner
Tagwacht” Nos. 32 and 34 of February 8 and 10, 1916.

p. 364





{46}

“I.K.”, “Internationale Korrespondenz”
(International Correspondence)—a weekly of the German social-chauvinists
dealing with international affairs and the labour movement. It was
published in Berlin from the end of September 1914 to October 1, 1918. An
apparent reference to the article “Hughes und die australischen
Gewerksschaften” (Hughes and the Australian Trade Unions) published in
Internationale Korrespondenz No. 15 on May 23, 1916. A copy of
this magazine with Lenin’s markings on the article is at the Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee.

p. 364





{47}

Appeal to Reason—the newspaper of the American socialists,
founded at Girard, Kansas, in 1895. It was not officially connected with
the Socialist Party of America, but conducted propaganda of socialist ideas
and was very popular among the workers.  The paper had contributions from
the American Socialist Eugene Debs.

There is some similarity between the way mankind should arrive at the abolition
of classes and the way it should subsequently arrive at the fusion of
nations. Thus, only a transition stage of dictatorship by the oppressed class
leads to the abolition of classes, only the liberation of the oppressed nations
and real eradication of national oppression leads to the fusion of nations, and
the political criterion of the feasibility of this lies precisely in the
freedom to secede. Freedom to secede is the best and the only
political means against the idiotic system of petty states and
national
isolation which, to mankind’s good fortune, is being inexorably destroyed
by the whole course of capitalist development.

Not for the press: 

   Taking into consideration 

(1) that Kommunist was founded—temporarily and as an
experiment—by a federated editorial board, when there had been no sign of
any difference on any substantial question between the
C.O. Editorial Board and the rest of the Editorial Board as a whole; 

(2) that after No. 1–2 of “Kommunist” three
members of the Editorial Board put forward such differences in their sighed
theses on the question of self-determination; 

(3) that an exchange of opinion on this question revealed deep
divergence over the assessment of the role of democratic demands and the
minimum programme in general;— 

—the C.C. resolves: to recognise the continuation of the journal
Kommunist as impossible and to declare that
  t h i s  publication  is  hereby  terminated.— 

Furthermore. With a view to extending the discussion on the
controversial questions and to having them clarified before a broader
circle of leading comrades, the C.C. resolves: 

to request the three comrades who have signed the theses to draw up a
motivated statement of their differences with the C.O. Editorial
Board.  

This statement together with a reply by the C.O. Editorial Board shall
be communicated to a broader circle of leading Party workers for a
final decision on whether it is desirable and necessary to open a
debate in the
press.{3} 

I very much regret that you are dragging out this “terribly
boring” business. I repeat—I, too, am terribly bored with
having to repeat—that I must decline to take part in
Kommunist.  

Your plan lacks principle and tends to confound the
confusion. If there are no profound differences of principle, the
submission to the C.C. is either slander or intrigue, and you will be
exposed by every worker in Russia.  

If there are,
  a s  m u c h  must be said: after No. 1–2 people have begun
to confuse things outrageously; w e
    

  decline  responsibility;  we believe it to be our duty
not to encourage but to expose.
  As  a  concession  we invite (see leaflet) them to have
another discussion

 ||

 before an “enlarged circle” (so as not to shame them in the press;
not to kill them outright by polemics).



           {That is the only reason.}  

For
 S b o r n i k  S o t s i a l-  D e m o k r a t a{4}  we
have, apart from a number of our
      articles,[1]

Varin + Alexander + reports + indictment (I have not yet received it) +
Safarov + Latvian + Kollontai (probably).  

The
Japanese{5} should be invited only to be shamed; Bukharin—only
order material on the economic question.  

Radek should  n o t  be invited (his article is  l e g
a l  and is not at all important in this shape). We shall
have to fight against his theses.  

Here is my opinion. Kommunist is a corpse and I am
not taking part in reviving it.  

Alexander (and the Russian workers in the Bureau) should confront them
with this question of
  p r i n c i p l e:
we do not take on the Editorial Board people who confuse things
outrageously and refuse to learn, who do not even wish to make an effort to
set forth their opinion. They want to
  p l a y  u s  o f f  against the P.S.D., that much is clear,
while they themselves are safe on the sidelines.  

Kommunist met the task of that period: to rally
everyone against social-chauvinism and Kautskyism.  

The task now is different: we are faced with a
  s t r u g g l e  against “imperialist
  E c o n o m i s m”.  

Salut,

Lenin 

P.S. Why did you not reply
  whether  or  not  Sukhanov  was  sent  to  Geneva?  I
 send you material for Grimm.  

No luck with translation of the theses.

There will be enough “writers” for

Kommunist was organised by Lenin and was published by the
Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat together with G. L. Pyatakov
and Yevgenia Bosh, who financed the publication. N. I. Bukharin was also on
the Editorial Board. One (double) issue was published. It carried, apart
from the article “The Voice of an Honest French Socialist”, two other
articles by Lenin: “The Collapse of the Second International” and
“Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”.  


The plan for the publication of the journal was worked out by Lenin in
the spring of 1915. He directed the organisational meeting of the Editorial
Board. Lenin hoped to make it an international organ of Left-wing
Social-Democrats. However, there soon appeared serious differences between
the Editorial Board and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh, which were aggravated
after the issue of No. 1–2. The Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosh group took an
incorrect attitude on many basic questions of the Programme and tactics of
the Party—the right of nations to self-determination, the role of
democratic demands and the minimum programme in general, etc.—and tried
to use the journal for their factional aims. On the Editorial Board, Lenin
conducted a struggle against the Bukharin Pyatakov-Bosh group, exposing
their anti-Bolshevik views and factional acts, and sharply criticising the
conciliatory attitude of G. Y. Zinoviev and A. G. Shlyapnikov towards the
group.  

In view of the anti-Party behaviour of this group, the Editorial Board
of Sotsial-Demokrat, on Lenin’s proposal, declared that it
considered the further publication of the journal impossible. The
C.C. Bureau in Russia, having heard a report on the differences on the
Kommunist Editorial Board, declared, its full solidarity with the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, and
expressed the wish that “all C.C. publications should be edited in a
strictly consistent tenor, in full conformity with the line of the C.C.,
which it had adopted at the beginning of the war”.

was to include Lenin’s article “A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist
Economism”, but the publication was discontinued for lack of funds.

 INITIAL VARIANT 0F THE R.S.D.L.P.  CENTRAL COMMITTEE PROPOSAL 
 Proposal from the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. to the Second Socialist Conference
     Called by the I.S.C.
       (Berne){1}
{8}

 (Theses on Points 5, 6, 7a and 7b and 8 of the Agenda) 

In announcing the convocation of the Second International
Socialist Conference, the I.S.C. published the following key points of the
agenda: 


 {{ 



5. “struggle to end the war”


6. “problems of peace”


7a. parliamentary “action”


7b. mass [ditto]


8. International Socialist Bureau.




[7a. 7b.:]


}} “agitation and propaganda” }}




The I.S.C. has invited the organisations to discuss these questions and
to send in their proposals. Here is the reply of our Party C.C. to the
invitation: 

1. Just as all war is but a continuation by violent means of the
politics which the belligerent states and their ruling classes had been
conducting for many years, sometimes for decades, before the outbreak of
the war, so the peace that ends any war can be nothing but a consideration
and a record of the actual changes brought about in the relations of forces
as a result of the given war.  

2. It is therefore the greatest absurdity and stupidity, from the
standpoint of theory, and from the standpoint of socialist doctrine, and
the greatest fraud on the working class in practice, to engage in talk
about assessing the present war on the strength of “simple” concepts of
defence and attack and about assessing the future peace on the strength of
“simple” pious wishes for a stable, democratic, honourable, etc., peace.


3. This war is an imperialist war, i.e., a war resulting

    

from contradictions on the basis of a highly developed monopoly capitalism
which is ripe for transition to socialism. This war is being fought for
world hegemony, i.e., for fresh oppression of the weak nations, for another
division of the world, for a division of the colonies, spheres of
influence, etc.—a division under which the old plundering powers,
Britain, France and Russia, would give up a share of their booty to
Germany, a young and stronger plundering power.  

4. That is why, unless the proletarian revolution overthrows the
present governments and the present ruling classes of the belligerent
“great” powers, there is
  a b s o l u t e l y  no chance of  a n y  peace  o
t h e r  than a more or less short-term armistice between the
imperialist powers, a peace accompanied by a growth of reaction
within the states, a growth of national oppression and enslavement
of the weak nations, a growth of inflammable material preparatory
for new wars, etc. For the fact is that from the objective content of the
politics which has been bred by the entire epoch of imperialism and which
the bourgeoisie of all the belligerent “great” powers had
conducted before  t h i s  war and is conducting during  i
t,  inevitably flows a peace resting on a new and even worse
oppression of nations, etc.  

5. To arouse in the masses of people ideas or hopes of the possibility
of a stable or democratic, etc., peace between the present governments and
the present ruling classes (i.e., the bourgeoisie allied with the
landowners), as most of the official socialist parties are doing, is not
only shamelessly to cheat the people but to lull them and distract them
from the revolutionary struggle, which is already starting in the form of
the strike and demonstration movement.  

6. It is precisely this kind of cheating the people and distracting the
proletariat from the revolutionary struggle that characterises the “peace
programme” which is now being “unanimously” put forward both by the
official spokesman of the Second International Huysmans at the Congress of
the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiter Partei of Holland at Arnhem, and by
Kautsky, the most influential theorist of the Second International and the
most influential advocate of the social-patriots and social-chauvinists in
all countries. Their programme consists in hypocritical

    

lip service to some democratic pious wishes: repudiation of annexations and
indemnities, self-determination of nations, democratisation of foreign
policy, arbitration courts to settle conflicts between states, disarmament,
a United States of Europe, etc.  

7. The best evidence that this “peace programme” is downright
hypocrisy is, on the one hand, the lip service paid to it by a number of
bourgeois pacifists and demagogic ministers of the belligerent countries,
and, on the other, its duplication by notorious (notorisch) chauvinists at
the conferences of “socialists” of one group of belligerent powers in
London (February
1915){9} and of the other in Vienna (April
1915).{10} It is the “socialists” who have entered the bourgeois
ministries carrying on the plunderous war, who have voted for the war
credits, who have helped the war by participating in various organisations
and institutions, etc., it is they who are  a c t u a l l y
conducting the policy of safeguarding the old and new annexations, colonial
oppression, etc., that have proclaimed to the world their “peace
programme”, consisting in a repudiation of annexations, etc.  

8. Kautsky, the leading authority of the Second Inter national,
declared to the whole world on May 21, 1915 (Neue Zeit) that this
accord and “unanimity” of “socialists” in
London{2}

and in Vienna over the principle of “independence” or self-determination
of nations is proof of the “unanimity” and “viability” of the Second
International in the “peace programme”. This defence and sanction of the
most crying and most brazen hypocrisy and deception of the workers is not
in any sense a coincidence, but a systematic policy which is being
conducted in a number of countries by men who pretend to be
internationalists but are actually making the imperialist war more
attractive by applying to it the idea of “defence of one’s country” and
consolidating the domination of the working-class movement by the
social-chauvinists, who have betrayed socialism, by preaching “unity”
with them. This policy, which is the most harmful and dangerous one for the
working class, is being conducted by Kautsky, Haase and others in Germany,

    

Longuet, Pressemane and others in France, most of the leaders in Britain,
Axelrod, Martov, Chkheidze & Co. in Russia, Trèves and others in
Italy (see the threat of the Central Organ of the Italian Party,
Avanti!, on March 5, 1916, to expose Trèves and other
reformist-possibilists{11} as to “who resorted to every means to
prevent the Party Executive and Oddino Morgan from taking action to secure
unity at Zimmerwald and to create a new International”). This world-wide
policy, which is of the utmost danger to the working class, could be called
a Kautskian policy, after its most authoritative spokesman.  

9. Socialists cannot refuse to fight for reform. They must vote
everywhere, including the parliaments, by the way, for all, even the
slightest, improvements in the condition of the masses, such as increased
relief for the inhabitants of the devastated areas, lessening of national
oppression, etc. But on the basis of the  p r e s e n t  war and
the peace flowing from it, this kind of reformist activity to
improve the condition of the masses is apparently possible only on a
miniature scale. It would be a crying deception of the masses to suggest to
them, whether directly or indirectly, the idea that the questions raised by
the  p r e s e n t  war could have a reformist solution. For
t h i s  war has created a revolutionary situation in Europe,
bringing to the fore the most fundamental problems of imperialism,
which will inevitably have an imperialist solution, except where the
present governments and ruling classes of Europe are overthrown through
revolution. That is why the principal and fundamental task of socialists in
the struggle for stable and democratic peace must be: first, to explain to
the masses the need for revolutionary mass struggle, to spread the
idea of it systematically, and to set up the necessary organisations;
second, to expose the hypocrisy and falsehood both of the
bourgeois pacifist and of the socialist, notably Kautskian, talk about
peace and the “unanimity” of the Second Inter national on the “peace
programme”. Such talk is doubly hypocritical on the part of “socialists”
who follow the bourgeoisie in denying the possibility of transforming the
present imperialist war into a civil war for socialism, and who oppose any
revolutionary work in that direction.  

10. The central point of the currently prevalent hypocrisy

    

concerning the “peace programme” is the allegedly unanimous recognition
of the struggle against old and new  annexations. But
those who talk of annexations and the struggle against them either cannot
or will not for the most part give thought to what annexation
is. Clearly, annexation will not be the right word for every
appropriation of “foreign” territory, for, generally speaking, socialists
favour the abolition of frontiers between nations, their getting closer
together and integration, and the formation of larger states. Clearly, not
every disturbance of the status quo can be described as annexation, for
this would be extremely reactionary and a mockery of the fundamental
concepts of the science of history. Clearly, annexation does not apply to
every kind of integration by force of arms, for socialists cannot repudiate
violence in the interests of the majority of the population and in the
interests of human progress. Annexation can and must clearly apply only to
the appropriation of a territory against the will of the
population of that territory. In other words, the concept of annexation is
inseparably bound up with the concept of self-determination of
nations.  

11. The present war—precisely because it is an imperialist
war insofar as both groups of belligerent “great” powers are
concerned—inevitably had to and did give rise to the phenomenon of the
bourgeoisie and the social-chauvinists “fighting” violently
against “annexations”  w h e n e v e r  this is done by an
enemy state. S\"udekum and his Austro-German friends and
defenders, including Haase and Kautsky, are silent about Germany’s
annexations in respect of Alsace-Lorraine, Denmark, Poland, etc., but very
frequently “struggle against the annexations” carried out by Russia in
respect of Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc., by Britain in
respect of India, etc. On the other hand, the British, French, Italian and
Russian S\"udekums, viz., Hyndman, Guesde, Vandervelde, Renaudel,
Trèves, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Chkheidze & Co., are silent about
Britain’s annexations in respect of India, France’s in respect of Nice or
Morocco, Italy’s in respect of Tripoli or Albania, Russia’s in respect of
Poland, the Ukraine etc., but then for  the  most  part
“struggle against the annexations” carried out by Germany.  
 

This kind of “struggle against annexations” on the part of the
social-chauvinists and the Kautskians is clearly downright hypocritical,
and the bourgeoisie is promoting their struggle both directly, by
allocating millions upon millions for chauvinist propaganda, and
indirectly, by giving the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians a monopoly
on legality.  

The French “socialists”, who justify war over Alsace Lorraine, and
the German “socialists”, who fail to demand freedom for Alsace-Lorraine
to secede from Germany, are clearly both annexationists, no matter how much
they swear to the contrary. The Russian “socialists”, who talk or write
against the “disintegration of Russia” or now, directly or indirectly,
justify the war over who is to enslave Poland, in the name of the “peace
without annexations” slogan, are clearly annexationists as well, etc.,
etc.  

12. If the “struggle against annexations” is not to become an empty
phrase or a revolting hypocrisy, socialists must:
  f i r s t,  explain to the masses that it is necessary to wage
revolutionary struggle for the proletariat’s winning of political power and
for a socialist revolution which stems from all the conditions of the
imperialist epoch and the present imperialist war and which alone can fully
secure the self-determination of nations everywhere, i.e., liberate the
oppressed nations, bring the nations closer together and effect their
fusion not on the basis of violence, but on the basis of equality and
accord between the proletariat and the working people of all nations;
s e c o n d,  they must immediately start the most extensive
propaganda and agitation against the veiled chauvinism and annexationism of
the official socialist parties, especially of those of the “great”
powers. Socialists must explain to the masses that a socialist and an
internationalist only in name but a chauvinist and an annexationist in fact
is the English socialist who fails at once to struggle for freedom to
secede for Ireland, India, etc.—the French socialist who fails to
struggle for the freedom of the French colonies, against the war to annex
Alsace and Lorraine, etc.—the German socialist who fails to struggle for
freedom to secede for Alsace Lorraine, the Danes, the Poles, the Belgians,
the Serbs, etc.—the Russian socialist who fails to struggle for freedom

    

to secede for the Ukraine, Finland, etc., against the war over Poland—the
Italian socialist who fails to struggle for freedom to secede for Tripoli,
Albania, etc.—the Dutch socialist who fails to struggle for freedom to
secede and independence for the Dutch East Indies—the Polish socialist
who fails to struggle for the full freedom and equality of the Jews and the
Ukrainians oppressed by the Poles, etc.  

13. From the Zimmerwald Manifesto and the I.S.C. circular of
February 10, 1916 (Bulletin
No. 3){12} inevitably flows the proposition that all “war against war”
and “struggle for peace” is hypocrisy unless it is indissolubly
bound up with immediate revolutionary mass struggle, and with its
propaganda and preparation. But this conclusion must be stated
straightforwardly and explicitly. We must, first, explain to the masses
where the development of revolutionary mass struggle in the conditions of a
European war can and must (mull) lead. It leads inevitably to the
transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war for socialism. A
hint of this is given in all the speeches saying that the workers
should die for their own cause rather than an alien one. But hints are not
enough. The great, even if perhaps not very near, goal must be clearly set
before the masses. They must know where to go and why. Second, if we call
on the masses to fight against their governments, “regard less of the
military position of the given country”, we thereby not only repudiate the
admissibility of “defending the country”, as a principle, in the
present war, but admit the desirability of defeat for
every bourgeois government in order to transform its defeat into
revolution. That, too, must be squarely put: revolutionary mass struggle
cannot become an international one unless its conscious representatives
unite openly for the purpose of defeating and over throwing all
bourgeois governments. Third—and this is the most important thing—it is
impossible to conduct any revolutionary mass struggle without
setting up everywhere, not only at the top, but also among the masses, an
illegal organisation for its propaganda and preparation, and discussion of
its course and conditions. Since there have been street demonstrations in
Germany, since there have been a number of letters from the front-lines in
France urging against subscription to the war loan, since there

    

have been mass strikes in Britain, to say nothing of Russia, then, to
promote this struggle, to help consolidate it on an international scale, it
is absolutely necessary to shed light on every step along that
road in a free, i.e., illegal, press, to verify the successes, to
weigh their conditions; to strengthen and develop the struggle. Without an
illegal organisation and an illegal press, recognition of “mass action”
will remain (as it has remained in Switzerland) an empty
       phrase.{3}


14. On the question of the socialists’ parliamentary action, it must be
borne in mind that the Zimmerwald resolution not only expresses sympathy
for the five Social-Democratic deputies of the Duma, who belong to our
Party, and who have been sentenced to exile in Siberia, but also
expresses its solidarity with their tactics. It is impossible to
recognise the revolutionary struggle of the masses while being content with
exclusively legal, exclusively reformist activity of
socialists in parliament; this can only arouse legitimate dissatisfaction
among the workers and cause them to desert Social-Democracy for
anti-parliamentary anarchism or syndicalism. It must be stated clearly and
publicly that Social-Democratic members of parliament must use their
position not only to make speeches in parliament, but also to
render all possible aid outside parliament to the underground
organisation and the revolutionary struggle of the workers. and that the
masses themselves, through their illegal organisation, must
supervise the activity of their leaders.  

15. The question of calling the International Socialist Bureau, placed
on the agenda of the Second International Socialist Conference, which is
being convened, inevitably raises a more fundamental question of principle,
as to whether the old parties and the Second International can be
united. The more extensive the mass sympathy for the Zimmerwald
association, the more incomprehensible to the masses, the more harmful for
the development of their struggle become the inconsistency and timidity of
the stand which essentially identifies the old parties and the Second Inter
national with the bourgeois policy in the working-class movement (see the
Zimmerwald Manifesto and the I.S.C.

    

circular of February 10,1916), while fearing a split with them and
promising to dissolve the I.S.C. as soon as the old International Socialist
Bureau meets.  

Such a promise was never voted on and was not discussed even
at Zimmerwald.  

The six months since Zimmerwald have made it even clearer that a split
is inevitable, that the work which the Zimmerwald Manifesto recommends
cannot be conducted in unity with the old parties, and that fear of a split
is a brake on every step along that way. In Germany it is not only the
I.S.D. group that has condemned the fear of a split and has openly come out
against the hypocrisy of the apostles of unity, but also Otto R\"uhle, a
member of the
       Reichstagsfraktion{4}

and Karl Liebknecht’s closest friend, who has openly come out for a
split. Nor was Vorw\"arts capable of putting forward against
R\"uhle a single serious or honest argument. In France, member of the
Socialist Party Bourderon spoke against a split, but in fact motioned a
resolution at the Congress, which “désapprouve (disavows) the C.A.P
(Comité Administratif Permanent=the party C.C.) and the G.P.”
(Groupe Parlementaire=the parliamentary group). Adoption of such a
resolution would clearly signify an immediate and unconditional split in
the party. In Britain even T. Russel Williams, writing in the moderate
Labour Leader, repeatedly and openly admitted the inevitability of
a split, and received support from a number of party members. In America,
where the Socialist Party is formally united, some of its members have come
out for militarism and war (so-called preparedness), and others, including
Eugene Debs, a former presidential candidate from the Socialist Party,
openly preach civil war for socialism in connection with the
coming war.  

Actually, there is already a split throughout the world, and
ignoring this fact would merely harm the Zimmerwaldists, making them
ridiculous in the eyes of the masses, who are very well aware that every
step of  t h e i r  work in the Zimmerwald spirit means a
continuation and deepening of the split.  

We must have the courage openly to recognise the inevitable

    

and the actual, to abandon any harmful illusions about the possibility of
unity with the “defenders of their Country” in the present war, and to
help the masses escape the influence of the leaders who “are misleading
them” (see the I.S.C. circular of February 10, 1916) or are hatching a
“plot” (Pakt) against socialism through an “amnesty”.  

That is our proposal on the item of the agenda concerning the
convocation of the International Socialist Bureau at The Hague.  
 *     *  * 

Reformist phrases are the main means of deceiving the people at a time
when the objective situation has placed on the agenda of history the
greatest world crisis, which, regardless of the will of the various
parties, can either be deferred and postponed until the next imperialist
war or resolved through socialist revolution. It is neither chance nor the
ill will of the several governments or the capitalists of some country but
the entire development of bourgeois relations that has led to imperialism
and the present imperialist war. Similarly, it is neither chance nor the
result of any demagogy or agitation but the objective conditions of the
crisis brought about by the war and the sharpening of class contradictions
that now generate strikes, demonstrations and other similar manifestations
of mass revolutionary struggle in a number of belligerent countries.  

Objectively, the question can only be put like this:
are we to help this, still weak but intrinsically powerful and deep-going
discontent and movement of the masses which may develop into a socialist
revolution, or are we to conduct a policy of helping the bourgeois
governments (Durchhaltspolitik, politique
   jusquauboutiste{5}

)?

The real meaning of the sweet talk about democratic peace consists
exclusively in help to the governments through the hypocritical
stunning and fooling of the masses.  
 *     *  * 

This war has brought to the fore the basic problems of imperialism,
i.e., of the very existence of capitalist society,

    

and it would be quackery to suggest to the people, directly or indirectly,
that these problems can have a reformist solution. It is a question of a
redivision of the world corresponding to the new balance of power between
the capitalist states, which in the last few decades have been developing
not only very fast, but also—and this is especially important—very
unevenly. On the basis of capitalist social relations, this new redivision
of the world is impossible other wise than through wars and violence. The
objective state of things rules out any reformist solution for the ripe
contradictions, it rules out any other way out except a series of
imperialist wars or a socialist revolution of the proletariat, the
conditions for whose success have already been created precisely by this
epoch of imperialism. Real political activity in the given circumstances is
possible only as this alternative: either to help your “own” national
bourgeoisie plunder other countries or to help the
    beginning....{6}

SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE RESOLUTION ON CONVENING THE INTERNATIONAL
SOCIALIST BUREAU{13} 
 APRIL 15 (28) 
1

The Lugano conference was held in September
1914.{14} If Messrs. Huysmans & Co. wished to convene the Bureau,
they could have done so long ago. But they have failed to do it. You deny
the split between the sections of the old International, but the split is a
fact. Today, we virtually have a crisis of all the socialist parties of the
world. On the one hand, you treat Thomas & Co. as abject characters and
traitors, and on the other hand, you say today: Oh, we

    

want to meet them, to discuss things and re-establish the International! What
you say is empty talk: it is empty talk because it comes today, 16 months after
Lugano. The men with whom you want to re-establish the International are dead,
they no longer exist, not literally, but politically.

2

If Grimm thinks that everyone should not vote separately, we are quite willing
to have the voting by groups. The last thing we want to do is to impose our
will, but we want the voting to take place; after that we shall willingly take
part. in the work of the committees.

3

The question would have been solved long ago, if a vote had been taken. It is
highly unfair that after many days of work together we have to forego the
vote. After all, the vote would take no more than 5 minutes! Martov’s
proposal is acceptable without
objections.{15}

The Second International Socialist Conference was held at
Kienthal, Switzerland, from April 24 to 30, 1916. It was attended by
43 delegates from 10 countries and discussed the following questions: =

1) the struggle to end the war; 2) attitude of the proletariat to questions
of peace; 3) agitation and propaganda; 4) parliamentary activity; 5) mass
struggle, and 6) convocation of the International Socialist Bureau.  

As a result of the work done by Lenin and the Bolsheviks before the
Conference, the Left wing at the Conference was stronger than at
Zimmerwald. The Zimmerwald Left worked out and motioned at the Conference a
draft resolution on peace, which contained Lenin’s basic
propositions. Although the Kienthal Conference failed to adopt the
Bolshevik slogans—to transform the imperialist

   

war into a civil war, to work for the defeat in the war of one’s own
imperialist government and to set up the Third International—it
nevertheless helped to bring out and rally, the internationalist
elements. Lenin said the Kienthal Conference was a step forward.  

Lenin wrote: “Draft Resolution on the Convocation of the Second
Socialist Conference”, “For the Conference To Be Held on April 24,
1916. Proposal of the Delegation” and “Proposals Submitted by the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. to the Second Socialist Conference”

(see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 121, 122, 169–79).

The International Socialist Commission (I.S.C.) in
Berne—the executive organ of the Zimmerwald association, set up by the
Zimmerwald Conference held on September 5–8, 1915. The I.S.C. included the
Centrists R. Grimm, 0. Morgan, Ch. Naine, and A. Balabanova as
interpreter. The official report of the Conference published in the
I.S.C. Bulletin No. 1 of September 21, 1915, said: =

“This secretariat should in no sense substitute for the now existing
International Socialist Bureau, and should be dissolved as soon as the
latter can fully answer its purpose.” On a copy of the report, now at the
Central Party Archives, Lenin underlined these words and wrote in the
margin: “Kein Beschluss dar\"uber” (There was no decision about this),
that is, the decision was adopted not by the Zimmerwald association, but
after the Conference.

p. 369

The London conference of the socialists of the Triple Entente
countries was held on February 14, 1915. It was attended by
representatives of the social-chauvinists and pacifist groups of Britain,
France, Belgium and Russia: the Independent Labour Party, the British
Socialist Party, the Labour Party, the Fabian Society, the French Socialist
Party, the General Confederation of Labour, the Belgian Socialist Party,
the S.R.s and the Mensheviks. On its agenda were these questions: 1) the
rights of nations; 2) colonies; 3) guarantees for a future peace.  

The Bolsheviks were not invited to the conference. However, on Lenin’s
instructions, M. M. Litvinov went to the conference to read out a
declaration of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee. It was based on a draft
written by Lenin. The declaration contained a demand for the withdrawal of
the socialists from the bourgeois governments, a complete break with the
imperialists, a repudiation of collaboration with them, resolute struggle
against the imperialist governments and condemnation of the voting of war
credits. As he was reading out the declaration, Litvinov was interrupted
and not allowed to continue. He handed in the text of the declaration to
the presidium and left the conference. On the London conference see Lenin’s
articles “The London Conference” and “On the London Conference”

(present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 132–34, 178–80).

A reference to the conference of socialists from Germany and Austria
held in Vienna in April 1915. It was a sort of response to the London

the imperialist war.

The circular—the appeal “To All Affiliated Parties and
Groups”—was adopted unanimously at the meeting of the enlarged I.S.C.
held at Berne from February 5 to 9, 1916. The delegation of the
R.S.D.L.P. C.C., led by Lenin, entered a statement saying that the appeal
was a step forward from the decisions of the First International Socialist
Conference at Zimmerwald, but that it did not find it satisfactory on every
point. The appeal was published in No. 3 of the I.S.C. Bulletin on
February 29, 1916, and in No. 52 of Sozial-Demokrat on March 25,
1916.

p. 375





{13}

The question of attitude to convening the International Socialist
Bureau was the subject of acute polemics at the Kienthal Conference on
April 27 and 28, 1916. The Kautskian section of the Conference motioned
several draft resolutions containing the common demand for recognising the
need to call the I.S.B. Supporters of the Zimmerwald Left, headed by Lenin,
opposed the idea. Under the pressure of the Left, the Right-wing delegates
had to support the draft compromise resolution worked out by the
committee. The resolution sharply criticised the I.S.B. and demanded the
replacement of the Executive Committee of the I.S.B. and expulsion of the
socialist ministers from their parties. However, it did not urge an
immediate break with the I.S.B. or the establishment of a new
International, but, on the contrary, authorised the national sections
within the Zimmerwald association to demand the convocation of the I.S.B.

This P.S.D. declaration at Zimmerwald shows that in opposing the right of
nations to self-determination, the Polish Social-Democrats wish to say something
quite different from what they are actually saying. They want to say that not
every movement for national independence deserves Social-Democratic
support. That is unquestionable both because any democratic demand is
subordinate to the common interests of the proletariat’s class struggle,
without being at all absolute, and because in the epoch of imperialist

    

rivalries to dominate the nations there may well be open and secret
alliances between the bourgeoisie of an oppressed country and an oppressor
country.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

This was a protest against the oppressive policy of the tsarist
autocracy, and the German and the Austrian governments, who, “depriving
the Polish people of the possibility of deciding its own future, regard the
Polish regions as a pledge in the forthcoming game of compensations....” =

“This is an especially gross expression of the essence of the policy of
the capitalist governments, who, while sending masses of people into the
slaughter, arbitrarily determine the future of the peoples for whole
generations.” The Polish Social-Democrats expressed the conviction that
only the participation in the imminent struggle of the revolutionary
international proletariat for socialism, “a struggle that would break the
chains of national oppression and abolish all forms of alien domination,
will assure the Polish people as well the possibility

   

of an all-round development as an equal member of the union of nations”.


The document published here was written by Lenin on a separate sheet
and is apparently a variant of the corresponding passage from his article
“The Discussion on Self-Determination Summed Up”

(see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 348).

The plan was drawn up not earlier than November 18 (December 1), 1916,
when Lenin was working on the material concerning the Marxist attitude to
the state. The sheet containing the plan was inserted in the notebook
“Marxism on the State”. That Lenin intended to write a work on the state
is evident from his note “The Youth International” published in December
1916. Analysing and criticising N. I. Bukharin’s article “The Imperialist
Predatory State”, Lenin wrote: “We hope to return to this very important
subject in a separate article”

(see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 466).

A comparison of the present plan with Bukharin’s articles “Concerning the
Theory of the Imperialist State” and “The Imperialist Predatory State”
shows that this is precisely the plan for an article aimed against
Bukharin’s anti-Marxist, semi-anarchist views of the state.  

In a letter to A. M. Kollontai on February 4 (17), 1917, Lenin wrote:
“I am preparing (have got the material ready) an article on the question
of the attitude of Marxism to the state”

(see present edition, Vol. 35, p. 286).

The article was intended for No. 4 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata,
but was apparently not written. The material collected by Lenin for the
article made up his notebook, “Marxism on the State”

(see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 33,
pp. 123–307)

and was used by Lenin in his book The State and Revolution

(see present edition, Vol. 25, pp. 381–492).

(1) Complete repudiation of defence of country both from the military
and the political standpoint, and ruthless exposure of the bourgeois lies
behind this slogan.  
 

(2) Unconditional rejection of all war credits and demands both in time
of peace and of war, and with a motivation of principle. Impose the duty of
doing this on the party’s representatives in parliament and in all other
state institutions.  

(3) Struggle in all the party’s propaganda and agitation—above all in
practical activity—against all military establishments, and repudiation
of all military duties to the bourgeois class state.  

(4) Systematic transition by the party to revolutionary struggle and
revolutionary tactics all along the line, instead of being confined to
reformism in practical activity.  

(5) Adoption of the work and activity of Karl Liebknecht and the whole
Spartacus group in
Germany{3} as a model of the only international activity, of real
struggle against the war and all wars, and emulation of their example.


(6) Struggle by means of propaganda, agitation and organisation against
the social-patriots (i.e., “defenders of their country”) and reformists
(i.e., opponents of the immediate application of revolutionary means of
struggle) within the Swiss Socialist Party.  

(7) Explaining to the masses that all solemn declarations against
militarism and war inevitably come to empty talk without a complete change
in the party’s structure and activity and without control by the resolute
opponents of social-patriotism and reformism of all the posts in the
socialist-political and also trade union, consumer and all other
working-class organisations.  

(8) Propaganda and preparation of a vigorous revolutionary mass
struggle (demonstrations, strikes and so on, depending on the
growth of the overall revolutionary struggle) for the purposes of the
proletarian revolution as the only means of doing away with wars.  

(9) Explaining to the masses that in case of necessity they must
themselves set up from below special organisations for such struggle
adapted to the hard conditions of wartime.  

(10) Making sure that the party’s revolutionary tasks in the struggle
against the high cost of living, war, etc., are known and clear to every
section of the exploited people outside the party.  
 

(11) Systematic propaganda in this context among young people of
pro-conscription age, and also in the army, etc.

The Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland (in French and
Italian cantons the party is called the Swiss Socialist Party) was set up
in the 1870s and was a member of the First International. It was
re-established in 1888. Strong influence in the party was enjoyed by the
opportunists, who in the First World War took a social-chauvinist stand. In
the autumn of 1916, the Right wing split away from the party and set up its
own organisation. The party majority headed by R. Grimm took a Centrist,
social-pacifist

   

stand. The Left wing of the party took an internationalist stand, Under the
influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the Loft
wing of the p arty gained in strength. In December 1920, the Left withdrew
from the party and in 1921 united with the Communist Party of Switzerland
(now the Swiss Party of Labour), which was formed in 1919.

p. 382

The Spartacus group—a revolutionary organisation of German
Left-wing Social-Democrats, formed at the beginning of the First World War
by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin,
J. Marchlewski, L. Jogiches (Tyszka) and W. Pieck. In April 1915, Rosa
Luxemburg and Franz Mehring founded the magazine Die
Internationale, which rallied the main forces of German Left-wing
Social-Democrats. On January 1, 1916, an All-German Conference of Left-wing
Social-Democrats was held in Berlin there the group was formalised and
decided to call itself the Internationale group. As its platform,
the conference adopted “Leits\"atze” (Basic Propositions) worked out by
Rosa Luxemburg with the participation of Karl Liebknecht, Franz Mehring and
Clara Zetkin. In 1916, the Internationale group, apart from
political leaflets which it published from 1915, began illegal publication
and circulation of “Political Letters” signed Spartacus (published
regularly until October 1918); then it also began to call itself the
Spartacus group.  

The Spartacists conducted revolutionary propaganda in the masses,
organised mass anti-war manifestations, directed strikes and exposed the
imperialist character of the world war and the betrayal of the opportunist
Social-Democratic leaders. However, they made serious mistakes in theory
and policy: they denied the possibility of national liberation wars in the
epoch of imperialism, failed to take a consistent stand on the slogan of
transforming the imperialist war into a civil war, underestimated the role
of the proletarian party as the vanguard of the working class and feared a
resolute break with the opportunists.  

In April 1917, the group joined the Centrist Independent
Social-Democratic Party of Germany, retaining its organisational
independence. In November 1918, during the revolution in Germany, the
Spartacus group broke away from the “Independents” and set up the
Spartacus Union, publishing its own programme on December 14, 1918. At
their inaugural congress (December 30, 1918-January 1, 1919) they set up
the Communist Party of Germany. Lenin repeatedly criticised the mistakes of
the German Left-wing Social-Democrats and pointed to the inconsistency of
their stand. At the same time, he put a high value on their revolutionary
activity. He wrote: “The work of the German Spartacus group, which has
carried on systematic revolutionary propaganda in the most difficult
conditions, has really saved the honour of German socialism and the German
proletariat”

(see present edition, Vol. 35, p. 369).

Page 6 (Paragraph 2). Here there should be an insertion
saying that Potresov has now in fact disavowed these propositions
(of Kautsky + Hilferding, etc.) containing a repudiation of reformism in
principle. Potresov has become a reformist.  

(It is not right to confine oneself to the statement: “we have never
had the intention of proving”; this should be put forward as
 p r o v e d,  and Potresov should be challenged:
you and especially Maslov & Co. of
Dyelo{3} have in fact, but tacitly, like cowards, altogether
gone over from this position to reformism.)  

Page 7 (end of § I) “mass action”?? It would be better to put
this otherwise, without using this word which has the fault that, being
largely caused by the  G e r m a n  censorship (a
pseudonym for revolution), it tends to obscure the concept of
revolution. (There will have to be a reckoning on this later with
Pannekoek + Radek & Co.!! Here is an example: there is no German
censorship in Switzerland and here the term “mass action” has  a l r
e a d y  brought about confusion which the reformists find useful.)


But that is not the main thing. The main point is in your idea, which
is basically incorrect, that “those of its (minimum programme)
demands ... add up to a transition to a basically different social
system” (page 7, § II,  e t  a l.)  (idem, p. 9).  

That is quite wrong!!  N e v e r  is a “transition to a
basically different social system” achieved e i t h e r by the
definite demands of the minimum programme (“those of its demands”)
or the sum  total of the minimum-programme

    

demands. To think so is to move over to the reformist position in principle
and to abandon the stand point of the socialist revolution.  

The minimum programme is one which is in principle compatible
with capitalism and does not go beyond its framework.  

You may have wanted to say that where society is objectively mature for
socialism, the implementation of the  sum total  of the
minimum-programme demands  would p r o d u c e  socialism. But
oven that is not so. The only thing that can be said is that it is most
probable in practice that out of any serious struggle for the
major minimum-programme demands  there will flare up  a
struggle for socialism and that we, at any rate, are working in
that direction.  

Another thing should not be forgotten, and this is some thing Pannekoek
+ Radek do forget, namely, that imperialism is the exploitation of hundreds
of millions in the dependent nations by a handful of very rich
nations. Hence, the possibility of full democracy inside the richest nation
with its continued domination over dependent nations. That was the
state of things in ancient Greece on the basis of slavery. That is how
things now stand with New Zealand and Britain.  

(By the way: page 8 is not good. That’s not the way to put
it. For instance, in the epoch of imperialism and the high cost of living
“bread” is precisely the thing you will not get through reform
alone.  

Page 8—defence against Potresov’s charge. The thing to
|_

do is not to defend yourself, but to attack: you c o n f i n e  y o u
r s e l f  to reforms, as the liberals did in Russia in 1904.)  

Page 10—in 1905; the liberals  confined themselves
|_

to reforms; we demanded, preached, prepared, etc., the revolution. Here it
is not a question of “concreteness”, but of the basic principle (essence)
of any revolution:
displacement of the old class and winning of “all power”
  (d e r  Macht) by the new class.  

(Page 10 bottom—you deal with the proletarian “reform” in a
terribly clumsy and imprudent way, although you do want to say:
“revolution”!! What you should say is perhaps:
“As in Russia in 1904 it is not reforms but a  r e f o r m )


Page 11 is all quite wrong. Imperialism will produce both the
8–hour working day and the “arming of the people”

    

against the socialist revolution. That is precisely the point over
which the struggle will not unfold. And, in general, it will not be
    over the minimum programme.


Imperialism will produce “Bulygin Dumas” and reforms
against the revolution. We shall be for the revolution.


“The most important questions of the present day” will not
be and are  n o t  those you name, but the high cost of living
(1) + (2)
imperialist wars.


Reforms are powerless against the high cost of living (in the presence of the
trusts, etc.), as they were against the autocracy in Russia in 1904–05.


You have incorrectly put the question of reform, and of the minimum
programme, and of democracy.



#

[[

I very strongly recommend rewriting it, confining yourself, for the time
being (for a small article in Voprosy Strakhovaniya), to the
antithesis: You, Mr. Potresov, are a full-fledged reformist, you confine
yourself to “reforms”, you  have forgotten  the
significance and meaning of the “formula”: “not
 reforms, but a reform”, the significance and meaning
 of the quoted statements by Kautsky + Hilferding +
 + Bauer, etc. Dyelo=ideologically quite
 mature organ of reformism, of the bourgeois labour party.



The “three
pillars”{4} before the revolution were an
extension of the struggle for reform. And that is exactly how the question is
formulated in the Manifesto of the Zimmerwald Left: all struggle for reform must
be channeled and transformed into struggle for revolution.


I do not think self-determination of nations should be set out as the
“most important” in general: in so doing you go miles beyond what we
have been saying until now. By coming out in this way you would force me to join
up against you with—oh, horrible thought!—Bukharin!!!


Isn’t it better to leave this question aside for the time being, rewriting
the article
à la # —and to work out some thing
in the form of theses, let us say, on the attitude to the minimum programme,
etc., for dispatch to the Bureau, etc.?




#

Phrases about “maximalism” are nothing but attacks by a
reformist on the revolutionaries (“opponents of
reformism

    

in principle” for the censorship). In general, it is an exceptionally
difficult thing and heikle sehr heikle
Sache!!{1}

to treat of  s u c h  a question in the censored press.

 

Notes
 

{1}

A ticklish, a very ticklish matter!!—Ed.

 



{2}

These are Lenin’s remarks to an article by G. Y. Zinoviev on maximalism
intended for publication in the journal Kommunist or the

   

newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat. The article did not appear in the
press.

p. 384





{3}

Dyelo (The Cause)—a fortnightly Menshevik journal, published
in Moscow from August 1916 to January 1917 under the editorship of
A. N. Potresov, P. P. Maslov and L. I. Axelrod (Orthodox). In 1916, there
were ten issues (three of them double issues), and in 1917—one. The
journal took a chauvinist attitude.

p. 384





{4}

Three pillars—the accepted designation in the legal
Bolshevik press and at open, legal meetings of the three basic
(“uncurtailed”) revolutionary slogans: democratic republic, 8–hour
working day and confiscation of all landed estates.

In Grimm:


Characteristics of the Centre

as a trend in international Social-Democracy:




+ 

1. No rupture with the social-patriots of one’s own  country
   either on basic principles, or in organisation; hence 2.




+ 

2. Against split.




(+—) 

3. Evasiveness on the question of defence of country.




+ 

4. Recognition of Zimmerwald and Kienthal—without
a split with the I.S.B. and international
social-patriotism.




+ 

5. No break with reformism: only verbal criticism
  of it (“passiver
Radikalismus”{1}

).




+ 

6. Adoption of a  wait-and-see  attitude
 (n o t  active,  n o t  with initiative as the Left)
on the coming revolution (in connection with
   the present  war).




+ (ΣΣ) 



(?=§ 1)


7. ΣΣ=prettifying (and defending) social-patriotism
in varying measure and by diverse means,
such is the  e s s e n c e  (wesen) of the Centre....




+ 

8. No reconstruction of the present Social-Democratic parties and trade
unions, nothing like Liebknecht’s “regeneration from top to
bottom”. Deferring this question.




(—) 

9. Social-pacifism as programme and tactics.




+ 

10. No systematic propaganda of revolution in connection with the present war.




+ 

11. No preparation of organisations, etc., for such a revolution.

The old programme will not do for the elections to the Constituent
Assembly. It should be altered:



1) add about imperialism as the final stage of capitalism


2) about the imperialist war, imperialist wars and “defence of one’s country”


+2 bis:
about the struggle and the split with the social-chauvinists



||


NB

|||



3) add about the state, the kind we need, and about the
withering  away  of the state.

    

      
4) Change


two last paragraphs before the political programme (against the
monarchy in general and measures to restore it)


5) add to § 3 of the political section:


no officials from the top

(cf. Engels in his criticism of
1891{2})



+ salaries to all officials: not higher than workers’ wages


+ right to recall all deputies and officials at any time


+ 5 bis) correct § 9 on self-determination


+ international character of socialist revolution in detail




6) correct and  r a i s e  many things in minimum programme.


7) In agrarian programme:



(α) nationalisation instead of municipalisation
(I shall send my MS. on this, which was burnt in
1909,{3} to St. Petersburg)


(β) model farms on landed estates.




8) “Universal labour service” (Zivildienstpflicht)


9) cross out support for “every  o p p o s i t i o n”
movement (a revolutionary one is a different matter).


10) Change name, because



(α) it is wrong


(β) it has been fouled by the social-chauvinists


(γ) it will confuse the people at the elections, because the
Social-Democrats=Chkheidze,  P o t r e s o v  & Co.





This is an outline of “letter No. 5”. Please return at once.


Do you happen to have any outlines or notes for changing
the practical section of the minimum programme? ((Do you remember us
discussing this  m a n y  t i m e s?))


This work should be started right away.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

This deals with the question of reworking the Party Programme. Lenin
first intended to devote the fourth and then the fifth letter to this
subject. But both the fourth and the unfinished fifth letter deal with
other subjects. The manuscript of the plan included in this volume shows
that Lenin subsequently added new points to it (2 bis, 5 bis and points
marked with a +).  

The plan became the basis for his work on the Party Programme upon his
arrival in Russia

(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 459–63, 466–79).



V. A. Karpinsky said the note in the margin was addressed to him.

p. 394





{2}

See Engels, “Zur Kritik des socialdemokratischen Programmentwurfes
1891” (Criticism of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891)
(Marx/Engels, Werke, Bd. 22, S. 240–43, Dietz Verlag, Berlin,
1962).

p. 395





{3}

The book burnt by the tsarist censorship was Lenin’s The Agrarian
Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution of
1905–1907, which he wrote at the end of 1907

(see present edition, Vol. 13, pp. 217–431).

In 1908 the book was printed in St. Petersburg, but was confiscated by the
police at the printers’ and destroyed. By 1917, only one copy remained. It
was first published in 1917.

Our friends did not wish to give any interviews. Instead
of an interview, the arrivals have handed through Politiken a
communiqué on the trip to the press and the public.  

The most important thing for us is to arrive in Russia as soon as
possible, Lenin said warmly. Every day counts. The governments have
done everything to hamper this trip.  

Did you meet any of the comrades from the German party?


No. Wilhelm Jansson from Berlin tried to meet us at Lingen on the Swiss
border. But Platten refused permission, giving a friendly hint that he
wished to spare Jansson the unpleasantness of such a meeting.

Politiken (Politics)—a newspaper of the Swedish Left-wing
Social-Democrats who in 1917 set up the Left Social-Democratic Party of
Sweden; it was published in Stockholm from April 27, 1916. From November
1917, it was published under the name Folkets Dagblad Politiken
(People’s Political Daily). From 1916 to 1918 it was edited by Ture
Norman. Among its contributors were the Left Zimmerwaldists of Germany,
Russia, France and other countries. In 1921, after the Left
Social-Democratic Party joined the Comintern and took the name of Communist
Party, the newspaper became its organ. Following a split in the Communist
Party in October 1929, the paper passed into the hands of the Right
wing. Its publication was discontinued in May 1945.

It is a downright invention to say that Frederik Str\"om,
allegedly contrary to the wishes of the Russians, had prevented a
representative of Socialdemokraten{1} from attending the
conference. To Str\"om’s question, Lenin replied: 

We have absolutely no trust in Mr. Branting.  If you
have trust in him, you are free to invite his representative.

## Russian Revolutionaries' Trip Across Germany

The Russian revolutionaries who arrived in Stockholm on
Friday morning handed to Politiken for publication the following
official communiqué concerning their trip: 

Britain, which officially welcomed the Russian revolution with “joy in
her heart”, at once did everything to nullify one of the results
of the revolution—the political amnesty. The British Government
does not allow transit to Russia for Russian revolutionaries who live
abroad and who oppose the war. When this had been proved beyond
doubt—this fact has been confirmed by numerous documents which will be
made public in the very near future, and Russian socialists of all
trends have stated as much in a unanimous resolution—a section of the
Russian Party comrades decided to try to return from Switzerland to Russia
via Germany and Sweden. Fritz Platten, Secretary of the Swiss
Social-Democratic Party and the leader of its Left wing, a well-known
internationalist and anti-militarist, conducted negotiations with the
German Government. For their trip the Russian Party comrades demanded the
right of extraterritoriality (no inspection of passports or
luggage; no officials allowed into their car). The group of those who
travelled could include anyone, regardless of political views, provided the
Russians themselves approved of his candidature. The Russian Party comrades
declared that in return they would demand the release of Austrian and
German civilians interned in Russia.  

The German Government accepted the terms, and 30 Russian Party
comrades, men and women, left Gottmadingen on April 9, including
Lenin and Zinoviev, editors of Sotsial-Demokrat,
the Central Organ of Russian Social-Democracy; Mikha Tskhakaya,
editor of
Nachalo{2} in Paris and a founder of the Caucasian
Social-Democratic organisation, who had earlier brought Chkheidze into the
party, and also several members of the Jewish Workers’ Union. Fritz
Platten was in charge of the trip and he alone conducted all the
necessary negotiations with the representatives of the German Government
who accompanied the train.  
 

During the three-day crossing of Germany, the Russian Party comrades
did not leave their car. The agreement was strictly honoured by the German
authorities. On the 12th instant, the Russians arrived in Sweden.  

Before their departure from Switzerland, a record was made of all the
preparations for the trip. Having studied this document, Henri
Guilbeaux, representing the French Social-Democratic group “Vie
Ouvrière” and editor of
Demain{3} a leader of the radical French opposition in Paris,
whose name cannot now be
divulged{4}; Paul Hartstein, a member of the radical German
opposition; M. Bronski, representing Russian-Polish
Social-Democracy, and Fritz Platten signed a statement voicing
their full approval of the way in which the Russian Party comrades had
acted.

NEWSPAPER REPORT 

In the street, standing on top of an armoured car, Comrade
Lenin greeted the revolutionary Russian proletariat and the revolutionary
Russian army, who had succeeded not only in liberating Russia from tsarist
despotism, but in starting a social revolution on an international scale,
and added that the proletariat of the whole world looked with hope to the
Russian proletariat’s bold steps.  

The whole crowd walked in a body behind the car to the Kshesinskaya
mansion, where the meeting continued.

## “Liberty Loan”









Lenin: 'Liberty Loan'






V. I. Lenin
“Liberty Loan”{1}
(DRAFT RESOLUTION WORKED OUT BY THE BOLSHEVIK GROUP OF THE SOVIET OF WORKERS’ DEPUTIES)

 Resolution of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies Concerning
the 4th “Liberty Loan” 

In virtue of the fact that the present war is a predatory
imperialist war, that its character has not changed at all since power in
Russia passed to the capitalist Provisional Government, and that the secret
treaties of the allied powers, which determine the true aims of the war,
remain in force—the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies protests
most vigorously against the so-called “liberty loan” and refuses to
support the Provisional Government in its intentions to drag out the war,
which benefits no one but the imperialist bourgeoisie.  

If the workers of all countries of the world vote for the loans issued
by their bourgeois governments to wage the imperialist war, it will be
impossible to find a way out of the horrors of the war, and all talk about
the fraternal

    

solidarity of the proletariat of the world, about internationalism, etc.,
will come to nothing but hypocrisy.  

The coupling of votes for the loan with wishes, statements,
declarations, etc., in favour of peace without annexations is especially
clear evidence of the disastrous discrepancy between word and deed, which
has destroyed the Second International.  

Until political and economic power has passed into the hands of the
proletariat and the poor sections of the peasantry, and while the aim of
the war is determined by the interests of capital, the workers reject any
new loans aimed not for but against Russia’s revolutionary freedom.  

Recognising at the same time that the supply of the army with all
necessities calls for resources, and not wishing to leave their
brothers without bread for a single hour, the Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies believes that the cost of the capitalist war should be
borne by the capitalists who have reaped and continue to reap billions of
rubles in profits on this war, and insists that the necessary money should
come exclusively from the pockets of the bourgeoisie and the landowners.

 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Bolshevik group of the Soviet discussed the attitude to the
“liberty loan” for two days, April 10 and 11 (23 and 24), 1917. The draft
resolution for the Plenary Meeting of the Soviet was worked out with
Lenin’s active participation. A resolution refusing support for the loan
was motioned by the committee headed by A. M. Kollontai, after which Lenin
and Zinoviev proposed a second resolution supplementing the first. The two
resolutions were consolidated and were adopted unanimously on April 11
(24). The report of the group’s sitting was published in Pravda
No. 31 of April 13 (26).  

In his report on the present situation at the April Conference, Lenin
said that the question of war “actually united us when we came out against
the loan”

(present edition, Vol. 24, p. 232).



At the Soviet’s Plenary Meeting, 2,000 deputies voted for the loan and
123 against.

1
 REPORT ON THE PRESENT SITUATION AND THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

 APRIL 14 (27) 
 NEWSPAPER REPORT 

The old traditional formulas (dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry) no longer meet the changed conditions. A
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship has been

    

established but not in the form we envisaged: it is inter locked with the
dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie. The imperialist war has
confused everything, turning the rabid opponents of the revolution—the
Anglo-French capitalists—into supporters of the revolution for victory
(the same applies to the lop army command and counter revolutionary
bourgeoisie).  

It is this unique historical concurrence of circumstances that has
brought about a dual dictatorship: the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and
the dictatorship of revolutionary democracy. In organisational terms, the
people have never managed to keep abreast of the bourgeoisie; in Russia the
people have set up their own organised power without having achieved
political independence. Hence, the dual power, the unconsciously trusting
attitude on the part of the petty-bourgeois majority of the soldier masses
and a section of the workers to the Provisional Government, and the
voluntary submission of revolutionary democracy to the bourgeois
dictatorship. The specific feature of the present situation is that lack of
political awareness on the part of the masses is preventing the
establishment of a stable and conscious majority on the side of the
proletarian policy (all other political trends have gone over entirely to
the petty-bourgeois position). The revolutionary democracy is an assembly
of the most diverse elements (in terms of class status and
interests, which is not the same thing at all!). Their
stratification: in the countryside—the well-to-do peasants, who have been
strengthened by the November 9 law, and the poor, one-horse and horseless
peasants, and in the towns—the sections close to the working class and
the petty proprietors; the separation of the proletarians and the
semi proletarians from the petty bourgeoisie is inevitable, but
the consolidation of the propertied elements in the revolutionary bloc may
well advance to a point where it will prevail over the organisation of the
masses rallying round the proletarian slogans. It is quite possible,
therefore, that power will remain in the hands of the bourgeoisie, and that
there will be no transfer of power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies. The conclusion: we are not faced with the task of overthrowing
the Provisional Government—it rests on the confidence of the
petty-bourgeois and

    

a section of the workers’ masses—but with that of painstaking explanation
of the class tasks and organisation.

 SPEECH IN MOVING A RESOLUTION ON THE WAR APRIL 22 (MAY 5) 

The resolution on the war was drafted in the committee, but
the final version is yet to be worked out. I think that in its final
wording the resolution will be put before the general Party conference, and
I now move that it be read out in its present form.  

The resolution consists of three parts: 1) objective causes of the war,
2) revolutionary defencism, and 3) how to end the war.  

First published in 1925 in the book Petrogradskaya obshchegorodskaya i Vserossiiskaya konferentsii R.S.D.R.P.(B.) v aprele 1917 goda (Petrograd City and All-Russia Conferences of the R.S.D.L.P.[B.], April 1917)

Printed from a typewritten copy of the minutes


 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The Petrograd City Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
was called by decision of the St. Petersburg Committee of April 6 (19) and
was hold from April 14 to 22 (April 27–May 5), 1917. It was attended by 57
delegates, including delegates from the Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, Polish
and Lithuanian organisations, representatives of the Military Organisation,
and also two mezhraiontsi

(see Note 556).

On the agenda were the following questions: current

   

tasks—present situation; attitude to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies and the question of its reorganisation; structure of Party
organisation; attitude to the other Social-Democratic trends; municipal
elections; harassment of Pravda.  

Lenin was elected honorary Chairman of the Conference. He gave the main
political report on “Current Tasks—Present Situation”, and was on the
committee to work out the resolutions: “On the Attitude Towards the
Provisional Government” and “On the War”; he motioned the resolutions
“On the Municipal Elections” and “On the Attitude Towards the Parties of
Socialist-Revolutionaries, Menshevik Social-Democrats, ‘non-factional’
Social-Democrats and other kindred political trends”.  

Kamenev’s attempt in his speech and amendments to Lenin’s resolution on
the attitude to the Provisional Government to put through the demand of
control over it, was exposed by Lenin as conciliatory, as the policy of
Chkheidze and Steklov.  

By an overwhelming majority, the Conference adopted Lenin’s resolution
on the attitude to the Provisional Government. At the first sitting it
adopted Lenin’s appeal “Against the Riot-mongers. To the Workers, Soldiers
and the Whole Population of Petrograd.”  

On April 19 (May 2) the sittings were interrupted in view of the
massive protest movement in response to the Provisional Government’s note
to the allied powers on April 18 (May 1) expressing its readiness to
continue the imperialist war. The Conference decided to urge the workers
and soldiers to give organised expression to their solidarity with the
basic propositions of the Party Central Committee resolution of April 20
(May 3) on the crisis in connection with the said note of the Provisional
Government

(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 184–85).

The delegates took part in explanatory work carried on by the Central
Committee in the masses. In view of this, subsequent sittings were not
fully attended.  

The decisions of the Petrograd City Conference testified to the
cohesion of the Petrograd Bolsheviks round Lenin’s “April Theses”;
Lenin’s tactics were given approval by the Party organisation of the
capital, the largest In the country. The resolutions of the Petrograd
Conference largely formed the basis of the resolutions of the Seventh
(April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)

(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 139–70).

We Social-Democrats who take the standpoint of inter national
socialism, are being accused of having returned to Russia via Germany, of
having been bribed by the Germans and of being traitors to the national
cause, the cause of freedom.  

Who is saying all this? Who is spreading these lies and slander?  

Soldiers and workers who read the working-class news papers are aware
that a decision of the Soviet which was taken after a hearing of the report
by Comrade Zinoviev

    

and Comrade Zurabov on how we managed to make our way across Germany, was
published in Izvestia Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh
Deputatov{1} No. 32, of April 5, 1917.  

Did the Soviet reprimand us? No. What did the Soviet say? It replied
that it wanted the Provisional Government to take urgent measures for the
unhampered passage to Russia of all Russian political exiles living abroad.


Comrade Lenin then stated that until now the Provisional Government has
failed to take any measures and that our socialist comrades living abroad
could not return to Russia. Why? Simply because Britain, who has a stake in
this fratricidal slaughter, has refused to allow passage for our socialist
comrades, socialists who have declared war against war and demand
peace. The British are keeping in prison one of their own British
socialists,{2} and have also arrested and imprisoned our Comrade
Trotsky, who was Chairman of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies in 1905.  

But that is precisely what has been done by all the capitalist and
landowner governments favouring this war: the French, the German and the
Italian governments have thrown all anti-war socialists into prison and are
keeping them there.  

Was it possible in the circumstances to travel via Britain? No. That is
why we had to apply to the Swiss socialist Platten, who also favours peace.


What was the upshot of this?  

Lenin and those who travelled with him were let through, but our
witness, Comrade Platten, who could testify that we had had no contacts
with the Germans, was not allowed to come to Russia.  

What is the point of all this?  

It is that this war, which is now taking hundreds of thousands of lives
a month, is being waged by the capitalists—they stand to gain from the
war, they are profiting from it, and that is why all those who want peace
and work for it are being imprisoned by the capitalists of all countries,
including the brigand and plunderer Wilhelm, who spread lies and slander
about the socialists.  

Comrade Lenin then went on to give a detailed explanation of the causes
of the war and its aims. He showed that

    

the working class and the poor peasants have never wanted and do not want
this or any other war. He also spoke in detail about the nature of the
Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Provisional
Government, on which the industrialist Guchkov and the landowners have
seats.  

Support and help should not go to the Provisional Government, but to
the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which is the only legitimate
government and which alone expresses the people’s interests.

Izvestia Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh
Deputatov (Bulletin of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies)—a daily; the first issue appeared on February 28 (March 13),
1917, under the title Izvestia Petrogradskogo Sovieta
Rabochikh Deputatov (Bulletin of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’
Deputies); from No. 3 of March 2 (15) the paper became the organ of the
Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.  

With the formation, at the First All-Russia Congress of Soviets, of the
Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies, the paper became its organ and from August 1 (14) (No. 132) was
published under the name Izvestia Tsentralnogo Ispolnitelnogo
Komiteta i Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatov
(Bulletin of the Central Executive

   

Committee and of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies). The paper’s political line was determined by the representatives
of the S.R.-Menshevik bloc who conducted the conciliatory policy of
supporting the bourgeois Provisional Government and who opposed the
revolutionary action of the proletariat.  

After the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, its Editorial Board
was changed and the newspaper became the official organ of the Soviet
Government. It carried the first important documents of the Soviet
Government and Lenin’s articles and speeches. In March 1918, its
publication was transferred to Moscow.  

After the formation of the U.S.S.R. in December 1922, the paper became
the organ of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R. and the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee. Under a decision of the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. on January 24, 1938, the paper was
reorganised and since January 26, 1938, until the present day it has been
published under the name of Izvestia Sovietov Deputatov
Trudyashchikhsya (Bulletin of the Soviets of Working People’s
Deputies).

1
 SPEECH ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION OF THE SOVIET OF
SOLDIERS’ DEPUTIES 

Lenin says that he has read the resolution of the Executive
Commission and the Committee on his activity and has decided to insert his
article on this resolution in Pravda; just now he wishes to reply
briefly to the charges being levelled against him. He finds that there are
four questions to which he wants to reply: 1) formal question, 2) question
of land, 3) of the government, 4) of the war.  

On the first question he welcomes the silence of the resolution on his
trip across Germany, as it shows that the Commission has taken the
standpoint of both sections of the Committee, which say nothing about
it. He reads an extract from the resolution: “... considers the propaganda
of so-called Leninists, etc.” and declares that he assumes full
responsibility for the Leninists’ propaganda. To reply to this charge in
the resolution, the three above-mentioned questions must be examined. He
goes on to explain these

    

questions. On the question of land—he favours the transfer of all land to
the use of the working masses without redemption; he speaks about the
transfer by decision of peasant committees, and refers to Shingaryov’s
telegram, which says that the taking away of land is an arbitrary act. That
is wrong because it has been done by decision of the village committees,
which makes the seizure legal. It is naive to think that the peasants can
be influenced by sermons from Petrograd; that is impossible. The question
of land will be decided on the spot. The land should be taken over right
away, in view of the looming famine. Voluntary agreement with the
landowners is an absurdity, you cannot have an agreement between
300 peasant families and one landowner, which is the ratio we now have in
European Russia.  

(A proposal is motioned to limit the speaker’s time. Statements are
made for end against; by a vote the time is limited to 20 minutes.)


Lenin says that if the meeting wishes it, he could alter the time of
the explanations, but could also be through within 20 minutes.  

On the state structure and administration he says that we need a
people’s republic, and not one with officials, capitalists and
troops. Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Farm Labourers’ Deputies, from
top to bottom, that is the ideal of administration. The people must have
the power. On the question of the War he says that he has never spoken
about the draft reinforcements and knows nothing of the question at
all.{3} That is why lie speaks only about the war. Our government
consists only of capitalists, the war is being waged to benefit the
capitalists, and the war can be ended only through a revolution by the
workers’ masses. The obligations undertaken by our allies are predatory,
they deal only with a sharing of the spoils; annexation is connected with
capital, and cannot be repudiated until capital is taken over. He holds the
capitalists in Germany to be the same as our own capitalists, and says that
Wilhelm is a bloodsucker and, of course, there can be no question of a
separate peace with him—that is absurd. The capitalists started the war
and cannot end it—there is need for a workers’ revolution to end the
war. The Leninists are

    

against any separate peace. They said as much back in 1915. They said that
the proletariat, once it takes power, and publishes all the treaties, must
offer peace to the whole
world.{1}

If anyone rejects such peace, the proletariat will start a revolutionary
war. Only a revolution by workers in several countries can put an end to
the war. Universal peace can be achieved only through a workers’
revolution. The practical method of ending the war is fraternisation at the
front, and strengthening the power of the Soviet of Workers’, Peasants’ and
Farm Labourers’ Deputies. That is the only way to bring about the workers’
revolution and universal peace.  
2
 REPLIES TO QUESTIONS 

1) The reconquest of Kurland is annexation, because in that
case Germany is entitled to reconquer her colonies. The people must be left
to decide for themselves how they want to live. In the capitalist world the
sharing out is according to strength—the stronger get more. It is not
worth while fighting over Kurland, but it is worth while fighting for
Kurland’s freedom to decide whom she wants to join.  

2) On the seizure of banks and money. He urges that the seizures should
not be arbitrary but by decision of the majority. (Shouts from the
audience: “Your doctrine leads to a primitive state”.)—No!
(Question: “What is to be done if other countries want
peace?”)—Advance of the workers’ revolution and fraternisation at the
front.  

Tactics—we must see how life goes forward. The experience of life is
the best thing. We must develop the Russian revolution in such a way that
the workers’, peasants’ and farm labourers’ deputies have the
power. (Another question:
“Is that what you preached in Germany?”)—We, that is, Zinoviev and I,
published a
pamphlet{4} abroad, in which we said precisely what we are saying now;
we published it in German and the German socialists circulated it in
Germany.

See present edition, Vol. 21, p. 403.—Ed.  
 



{2}

Arriving at a meeting of the soldiers’ section of the Soviet of Workers
and Soldiers’ Deputies on April 17 (30), Lenin requested the floor to make
an urgent statement over the publication in the newspapers on April 16 (29)
of the resolution of the Executive Commission of the soldiers’ section
which condemned the “propaganda of the Leninists” as being just as
harmful as “any other counter-revolutionary propaganda from the right”

(see present edition, Vol. 24, p. 172).

As he was speaking the Menshevik-S.R. majority, against the protests of the
minority, got it dine limited to 30 minutes. When Lenin finished speaking,
he replied to questions from the meeting and then to those of the soldiers
who surrounded him in a room at the exit of the Taurida Palace.  

After Lenin’s speech and objections to it from the Menshevik Lieber,
the soldiers’ section decided to proceed with its business, without making
any statement on the substance of the question.  

Lenin’s speech was published in a distorted version in Rech
and Yedinstvo. It is here published in accordance with the minutes
now at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee.

March 1 (14), that the garrison units which had taken part in overthrowing
the autocracy were not to be withdrawn from Petrograd.

Comrades Lashevich, Krymov and Mavrin, authorised by the
Bolshevik group of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, request
us to declare that the overwhelming majority of the workers who took part
in the manifestations on April 20 and 21 and carried “Down with the
Provisional Government!”  placards, understood this slogan to mean
exclusively that all power should be transferred to the Soviets and that
the workers want to take over only after winning a majority in the Soviets
of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The present composition of the Soviet
does not quite express the will of the majority of the workers’ and
soldiers’ masses. That is why the Bolshevik group believes that the
C.C. resolution of April 22 does not give a precise characteristic of the
present state of affairs.  


From the Editors. It goes without saying that the
C.C. resolution is in no sense aimed against the organisers of the mass
demonstrations, and that such an interpretation of the slogan rules out any
idea of thoughtlessness or adventurism. At any rate, the peaceful and
impressively massive character of these manifestations is to the great
credit of these comrades as representing the organisers of the
manifestations. They alone organised a fitting rebuff to the bourgeoisie,
which was demonstrating in favour of its own Provisional
Government.

The ministerial gentlemen, having secured a fresh
expression of confidence on the part of the majority of the Soviet leaders,
have started a fresh offensive against Pravda and against our
Party.  

Rech, the ministerial newspaper, has adopted the worst methods
of Russkaya
Volya.{1} 
 

In today’s two editorials, the ministerial newspaper, rehearsing the
Russkaya Volya elements, does enough lying for two papers.  


   “The whole ”(sic)“ of Petrograd has awakened; it has
   gone out into the street and has loudly and solemnly proclaimed its
   confidence in the Provisional Government.”  


“The whole” of Petrograd!—the ministerial paper will have
nothing less.... If from the “whole” of Petrograd we subtract all the
workers, who demonstrated against the Provisional
Government, if we subtract the vast majority of the soldiers who went out
into the street and demonstrated against the Provisional
Government, if we subtract the hundreds of thousands of people who simply
stayed at home, if the “whole” of Petrograd is taken to mean an
insignificant minority of the bourgeoisie, a small section of the students,
and a section of the senior army officers—then the ministerial paper is
right: the “whole” of Petrograd has come out for the Guchkovs and the
Milyukovs....  

Relying on the “whole” of Petrograd (remember the Potemkin
villages!{2}), the ministerial newspaper launches directly into pogrom
baiting against us.  


   “...Those shots by some armed men, these killings of
   soldiers, in connection with the unprecedentedly brazen flying of the
   defeatist flags from the German embassy.... Yesterday’s bloody outrages by
   the Leninists have worn thin everyone’s tolerance and have dealt an
   irreparable blow to this anti-national treasonable propaganda. Let us hope
   that this propaganda will never again dare to rear its head.”  


Let the reader judge where the brazenness lies. Every word there is
lies and slander. Our comrades did not fly any flags at all from the German
embassy. Our comrades are not to blame for the killings of the
soldiers. Responsibility for yesterday’s acts of violence falls on the
Provisional Government and no one else.  

Let the reader judge whose propaganda is really treasonable.

{1}
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) was called by decision of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) Central
Committee, taken between April 4 and 8 (17 and 21), and was held in
Petrograd from April 24 to 29 (May 7–12), 1917. It was the Party’s first
conference in legal conditions. It was attended by 131 delegates with vote
and 18 with voice from 78 Party organisations (including Petrograd and its
environments, Moscow and Moscow District, the Central Industrial Area, the
Urals, the Donbas, the Volga area and the Caucasus) and also by
representatives of front and rear military organisations, the national
organisations of Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and Estonia. On the
strength of its representation and the political and organisational tasks
it dealt with, the Conference could perform and did perform the work of a
Party congress: it worked out the political line for the whole Party and
set up the Party governing centres.  

At 2 p.m. on the day before it opened, there was a meeting of more than
a hundred delegates at which new items were added to the agenda and the
standing orders of the Conference were approved. A report on the April
21–22 events was given by Lenin who was met with warm applause. On the
agenda of the Conference were the following questions: the current
situation (the war and the Provisional Government, etc.), a peace
conference, attitude to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies,
revision of the Party Programme, the situation within the International and
the Party’s tasks, unification of the internationalist Social-Democratic
organisations, agrarian question, national question, Constituent Assembly,
organisational question, reports by regions and elections to the Central
Committee.  

Lenin opened the Conference with a brief speech of welcome and was
elected to the presidium. He directed all the work of the Conference.  

The Conference exposed and rejected the Right-wing capitulatory line of
L. B. Kamenev, who gave a co-report on the present situation as the
representative of an anti-Leninist group. L. B. Kamenev and A. I. Rykov
tried to oppose the Leninist line towards the socialist revolution by the
opportunist assessment of the 1917 revolution, and the prospects of its
development. Denying the possibility and need for the bourgeois-democratic
revolution to develop into a socialist revolution, Kamenev proposed that
the



Conference should confine itself to accepting control over the bourgeois
Provisional Government on the part of the Menshevik S.R. Soviets. The
Conference rejected the capitulatory stand of Kamenev and his small group
of supporters, who denied the possibility of the victory of socialism in
Russia.  

In his report on the revision of the Party Programme, Lenin determined
the direction in which the Programme Committee set up by the Conference was
to rewrite the Programme of 1903.  

During the debate on the national question, G. L. Pyatakov spoke
against Lenin’s slogan of the right of nations to self-determination
including secession and the formation of an independent state. In support
of his resolution on the national question, Lenin said that this right
alone ensured complete solidarity of workers and all working people of
different nationalities; while the expediency of secession was to be
decided by the proletarian party “in each particular case, having regard
to the interests of social development as a whole and the interests of the
class struggle of the proletariat for socialism”

(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 302–03).



Lenin’s thesis on the break with the Zimmerwald Centrist majority and
the establishment of the Third, Communist International was opposed by
G. Y. Zinoviev. The Conference made a mistake by voting for the Bolsheviks’
participation in the Third Zimmerwald Conference, which was predominantly
Centrist in composition, thereby delaying preparations for the
establishment of the Third, Communist International. Life itself very soon
corrected this mistake

(see present edition, Vol. 24, p. 388, and the unfinished article “The
Tasks of Our Party in the International”, Vol. 26, pp. 220–22).



The Conference elected the Central Committee headed by Lenin. 

The historic importance of the Seventh (April) Conference lay in the
fact that it adopted Lenin’s programme for transition to the second stage
of the revolution in Russia, mapped out the struggle for the development of
the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution and put
forward the demand for the transfer of all power to the Soviets. Under this
slogan, the Bolsheviks prepared the masses for the proletarian revolution.

The revolution has not stopped, it is just starting.  

Petrograd has awakened Russia. Petrograd has liberated her. The great
cause of the Petrograd workers.  

The Soviet of Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies will subsequently take
power and do away with war and the rule of capital!  

What the Petrograd workers have started, the soldiers’ fraternisation
at the front will continue.  

Fraternal alliance of workers of all countries.  

Revolutionary alliance.

The sage Rabochaya Gazeta has assured its readers
that Plekhanov and Lenin are allies because both oppose the Stockholm
conference of the social-chauvinists. Rabochaya Gazeta confines
itself to issuing a few shouts, saying not a word about our arguments in
substance, and keeping

    

silent about the fact that this conference is a screen for
capitalist diplomats!  

This is a cheap trick!  

Marxists must tell the people the truth and expose the tricks of the
diplomats operating through the social-chauvinists.  

No Marxist will allow himself, as Rabochaya Gazeta does, to
keep silent about the fact that the refusal of the French
social-chauvinists means a desire on the part of the Anglo-French
and Russian bourgeoisie to drag out the war until Germany’s total defeat.

Comrades! The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies has transmitted to me your letter of April 24, 1917. In it you ask
about my origin, where I had been, whether I had been exiled and what
for. In what manner I returned to Russia and what is my activity at the
present time, i.e., whether it (this activity) is doing you good or harm.



I reply to all these questions, except the last one, because it is for
you to judge whether or not my activity is doing you any good.  

My name is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.  

I was born in Simbirsk on April 10, 1870. In the spring of 1887, my
elder brother Alexander was executed by Alexander III for an attempt on his
life (March 1, 1887). In December 1887, I was arrested for the first time
and expelled from Kazan University for students’ disturbances; I was then
banished from Kazan.  

In December 1895, I was arrested for the second time for
Social-Democratic propaganda among the workers of
  St. Petersburg....{1}

This is an unfinished reply to the letter of the soldiers’ committee of
the 8th Horse Artillery Battery (army in the field) sent to the Petrograd
Soviet. It was dated April 24 (May 7), 1917, that is, the period when the
bourgeois and after it the petty-bourgeois press

   

started a slander campaign against Lenin and the other members of the
Bolshevik Party who had returned to Russia from Switzerland via Germany.


The soldiers’ letter said: “In view of the fact that there is much
friction over Lenin among the soldiers of the battery, please let us have
the earliest possible reply. What is his origin? Where had he been? If he
had been in exile, what for? How did he return to Russia and what is he
doing at present, that is, are his acts doing us good or harm? In short, we
should like to be convinced by your letter, so as to stop our arguments,
lose no more time and be able to prove our point to other comrades as
well” (Pravda No. 86 of April 16, 1927).  

The letter was passed on to Lenin.

Comrade Lenin begins by saying that the conference met at
an extraordinary time: there is now a revolution in Russia and an
unprecedented war all over the world.  

Consequently, if we are to understand the decisions of our conference
we must first of all understand the kind of war we are waging and who began
it, what kind of revolution we have carried out and the kind of revolution
that lies ahead of us.  

The war was not started by the workers and peasants:
neither the Russian, the German, the French, the Italian the Belgian, nor
the British workers and peasants started this war. The war was started and
is being continued by the capitalists of the world: the British capitalists
and their friends, the French, the Russian and the Italian capitalists,
against the German capitalists and their friends, the Austrian capitalists.


What is this war being fought for?  

Is it being fought for the emancipation or for the interests of the
workers and peasants? No, it is not.  

The purpose of the war is plunder and a division of foreign
lands—that is what makes the capitalists shout about the war to a
victorious end.  

Tsar Nicholas, as big a brigand as Wilhelm, concluded secret predatory
treaties with the British and French capitalists; these treaties are not
being published as otherwise the whole people would realise the fraud, and
the war would quickly be over. That is why our resolution on the war flatly
calls this war a predatory imperialist war.  

How, then, can an end be put to this world-wide slaughter? Can it be
ended by someone pulling out of it?  

No, it cannot. It cannot because the war is being fought not by two
states but by many, and because the capitalists can end the war only for a
time in order to prepare for a new one. That is the kind of peace no worker
or peasant wants,

    

whoever he may be, a German, a Frenchman or a Russian.  

Who, then, can end the war?  

The war can be ended only by the workers and peasants, not of Russia
alone, but of the whole world. The workers and peasants of the world have
the same interests: struggle against the capitalists and the
landowners. That is why, only by uniting, the workers and peasants of the
world can put an end to this war. That is why we Bolsheviks are against a
separate peace, i.e., against a peace only between Russia and Germany. A
separate peace is a stupidity, because it fails to settle the basic issue,
the struggle against the capitalists and the landowners.  

How, then, are the workers and peasants of the whole world to unite?
The war is in their way.  

The Russian revolution has toppled the autocracy and has given the
Russian people unprecedented freedom, which is unmatched among any people
of the world. But has it settled the basic question of Russian life, the
question of land? No, because the land is still in the hands of the land
owners. Why is that so? Because the people who overthrew the tsar handed
over power not only into the hands of their elected
representatives—peasants and workers, the Soviets of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies, but also into the hands of the Provisional Government.


The Provisional Government, let us note, consists of capitalists,
landowners and those who sincerely or hypocritically say that Russia can be
saved only hand in hand with the landowners.  

But the landowners refuse to give land to the peasants, the capitalists
refuse to give up their profits from the war and the plunder of foreign
lands.  

That is why we Bolsheviks do not support the Provisional Government,
and do not advise socialists to take ministerial office.  

Socialist ministers can do no more than lend their names to cover up
plunder and conquest. And they are already doing so. They have entered the
government and have joined the capitalists in saying: this war is not only
a defensive, but also an offensive one, and the peasants will not get their
land now, but after the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.  
 

That is why we are against the Provisional Government and recognise
only our own government: the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies. There is no better government, the people have not yet created
one, and you can’t invent one.  

Why, in that case, has this government of ours decided to give support
to the Provisional Government consisting of capitalists, landowners and
socialists, who do not want to give land to the people now and preach an
offensive? Because we now have in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies a majority of peasant-soldiers who do not understand what each of
the parties wants in practice.  

Hence, our task is patiently to explain to the workers and peasants
that everything—the end of the war, land for the peasants, and real
struggle against the capitalists, not in words, but in deeds—will be
secured only when the whole people comes to realise not from books, but
from its own experience that only full power for the workers and peasants,
only the power of the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
can help to start a resolute struggle for peace, for land and for
socialism.  

You cannot disregard the people. Only dreamers and plotters believed
that a minority could impose their will on a majority. That was what the
French revolutionary Blanqui thought, and he was wrong. When the majority
of the people refuse, because they do not yet understand, to take power
into their own hands, the minority, however revolutionary and clever,
cannot impose their desire on the majority of the people.  

From this flow our actions.  

We Bolsheviks must patiently and perseveringly explain our views to the
workers and peasants. Each of us must forget our old view of our work,
each, without waiting for the arrival of an agitator, a propagandist, a
more knowledgeable comrade who will explain everything—each of us must
become all in one: agitator, propagandist and Party organiser.  

That is the only way we can get the people to understand our doctrine,
to think over their experience and really take power into their own hands.

On Tuesday, May 9, more than 200 émigrés,
travelling across Germany, arrived from Switzerland. Among them were the
Menshevik leader Martov, the Socialist-Revolutionary leader Natanson and
others. This transit has provided fresh evidence that there is no other
reliable way from Switzerland, except via Germany. Izvestia
Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatov (No. 32 of
April 5) carries a report by Lenin and Zinoviev about their trip across
Germany, giving the names of the socialists of two neutral countries
(Switzerland and Sweden) who certified by their signatures that the trip
across Germany was undertaken of necessity and that it did not involve
relations with the German Government which were in any way reprehensible.

Concerning Comrade Tomsky’s reference to the workers press

factually incorrect and that the mission of the newspaper
Vperyod{1} (headed by A. A. Bogdanov and others) was
undoubtedly useful.

On behalf of the Central Committee, Lenin greets all
internationalist Social-Democrats without distinction of group affiliation.


The speaker goes on to the question of how the European war can be
eliminated. It then turns out that he does not see the settlement of the
European crisis in such optimistic colours as
A. Lunacharsky.{1} He says that the “without annexations” formula
does not at all mean any desire to return Europe to the “status quo
ante”. We believe that “without annexations” also means without the
seizures carried out before the war. We take this formula to mean giving
the peoples complete freedom to secede from one state and join another. But
it is impossible to implement this formula without a socialist revolution,
which is why there is no way out of the European war except a world-wide
revolution.  

Referring to fraternisation, Lenin says: the spontaneous fraternisation
will not settle the question of peace, but we regard it as the cornerstone
of our revolutionary work. Fraternisation does not in itself solve the
question, but then no other measure alone decides the revolution until it
leads to one. What is a strike or a demonstration? They are after all only
a link in the entire chain of the revolutionary struggle. We are being told
that this fraternisation has worsened the situation on the other
fronts. That is not true. It has created a virtual armistice on our front
and has caused small changes on the Western front. But in whose favour? In
favour of Britain and France. On the other hand, Britain has scored a great
success in Asia:
she has gobbled up Baghdad. The suspension of the fighting on our front has
been brought about by revolutionary fraternisation, against which Kerensky
is waging a war, and against which an offensive signed by the Mensheviks
has been announced.  
 

We must make fraternisation conscious, we must see that it is
transformed into an exchange of ideas, that it is carried over to the other
fronts, that it kindles a revolution on the other side of the trenches.


On the question of regulating industry, the speaker says: since
February 28, the government has done nothing to cut down the
industrialists’ profits. The other day we read about the establishment of a
commission consisting of several ministers led by Skobelev to work out
control measures. But we had commissions under the tsar, they are nothing
but a swindle. The speaker says there is need immediately to take over the
landed estates, and ends his speech by stating that the Soviets of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Deputies must either take all the power or die an inglorious
death.  

Notes are being passed to the speaker from every side. Within a short
time they number 20. The first of them asks whether the draft
reinforcements should be sent to the front. Replying to the question, Lenin
says: under the tsarist power we had to go into the army and work
there. Liebknecht put on a uniform to conduct agitation against the war. It
is naive to think that the war can be abolished by separate anarchic
action.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

A. V. Lunacharsky, who spoke before Lenin, proposed an ultimatum to the
governments of France and Britain to make them accept the formula of peace
without annexations and indemnities, and the announcing of a ceasefire on
all fronts. At the same time, said Lunacharsky, we must appeal to the
peoples of the Allied countries and also of Germany and Austria, urging
them to exert pressure on their governments with all means at their
disposal. If the German Government should insist on continuing the war
under this unconditional formula, the falsity of its assertion that it was
waging a defensive war would be exposed.

Having studied the resolutions of the Congress of Soviets
and other organisations, carried today in Izvestia Petrogradskogo
Sovieta, and also the C.C. resolution published in Pravda,
concerning the observance of the ban on demonstrations for three days—


—having studied these resolutions and discussed the state of
affairs,

 

resolves: 

In view of the fact that the Congress of Soviets and the Executive
Committee of the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies have made their
straightforward statement in their appeal: 

“We know that concealed forces of the counter-revolution want to take
advantage of your demonstration” 

—in view of this it is necessary to admit that we have imagined the
counter-revolution to be much weaker, for we have no knowledge as yet of
what the Congress of Soviets knows; 

—that, consequently, the struggle against the counter revolution is
an even more urgent item on the order of the day; 

—that the C.C. resolution on abiding by the direct ban on
demonstrations for three days is correct; 

—that it is
    necessary....{1}

We are being asked in what sense we saw Grimm’s behaviour
as being “ambiguous”. We reply—for readers who have not had the
opportunity of securing the issue of the newspaper Volya
Naroda,{1} which was precisely indicated—that the protocol we
signed (we would have willingly reprinted it, but for the lack of space in
Pravda) speaks only of Grimm’s attitude to
Hoffmann, the bourgeois minister of the same neutral
country (Switzerland).

Here is what Mr. Stan. Volsky, a leader writer of
Novaya
Zhizn,{1} has talked himself into today: 


   “...While denying the right of the big nations to
   enslave the small nationalities, socialism has never recommended the
   opposite course of action: enslavement of the big nations by the small
   nationalities. But it is precisely to this kind of violence against the
   will of the all-Russia democracy, to a denial of joint revolutionary
   democratic work, a substitution of national hostility for the class
   struggle, that the programme, or at any rate the tactics, of the Ukrainian
   Rada boils down....”  


There you see where the swings of the Novaya Zhizn
petty-bourgeois chatterboxes are taking them—straight to the
Black-Hundred reaction! It is after all only the Menshikovs yesterday and
the Katkovs the day before yesterday who could say that the Ukrainians’
desire to have their own sejm, their own ministers, their own army, their
own finances and other things was “enslavement” of the Russian people!


A foul Great-Russian chauvinism, touched up with sweet quasi-Marxist
words, such is the sermon of Minister V. Chernov, Mr. Volsky and
Rabochaya Gazeta.

Letopis. Characterising this group, Lenin said that “intellectual
scepticism, which conceals and expresses lack of principle, is the dominant
mood” in their midst

(see present edition, Vol. 25, p. 271),

and ironically called them “would-be internationalists” and
“pseudo-Marxists”.  

The newspaper took a hostile attitude to the Socialist Revolution in
October 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet power. From June 1, 1918,
it had two editions: one in Petrograd, another in Moscow. Both were closed
down in July 1918.

At the morning sitting, Lenin gave a report on the current
situation. He noted the difference between the situation today and that
during the Party’s April Conference. At that time, the stand of the various
socialist parties had still hardly crystallised. Only now, in the present
conditions, and in the light of the events that have just taken place, has
the real political face of the Mensheviks and the S.R.s been revealed. But
the petty bourgeoisie, without being

    

socialist, may turn out to be really democratically minded. Viewing the
S.R. and Menshevik masses from that stand point, we must give them credit
for consistent democratism. But that cannot be said of their leaders, which
is why we find that there is a yawning gulf between the S.R. and the
Menshevik masses, on the one hand, and their leaders, on the other. The
leaders of these masses have been gradually shedding not only their
socialism, but their democratism as well. This will be seen in the attitude
of the socialist ministers to the three vital issues of the moment.  

On the question of land, the socialist section of the government has
clearly diverged from the views of the peasantry, and is helping the
landowners to keep their lands at their disposal. The second touchstone of
the socialist ministers’ democratism is their attitude to local
self-government. It is an elementary democratic proposition that the local
power must be elected by the people them selves, but on this point there
have been numerous conflicts between the Provisional Government and the
local organs of self-government, and the socialist section of the ministry
has been an active fighter against these truly democratic
principles. Finally, the third question is the offensive. The socialist
Kerensky has managed to secure what the patent imperialist Guchkov had been
unable to do.  

We revolutionary Social-Democrats must direct our activity towards
raising the class consciousness of the democratic masses. That is why we
must relentlessly expose these former leaders of petty-bourgeois democracy,
pointing out to democracy the only way along which the revolutionary
proletariat will march ahead of it.

Lenin’s report, which was central in the work of the All-Russia
Conference of Front and Rear Military Organisations of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.),
has been preserved in two variants: as recorded by a correspondent of
Novaya Zhizn, which published it the following day, June 21
(July 4), 1917, and by M. S. Kedrov (see his reminiscences “The All-Russia
Conference of Military Organisations of the R.S.D.L.P.[B.]” in the book
Velikaya Oktyabrskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Revolutsia. Sbornik
vospominany uchastnikov revolutsii v Petrograde i Moskve [The Great
October Socialist Revolution. A Collection of Reminiscences by Participants
in the Revolution in Petrograd and Moscow], Moscow, 1957, pp. 77–79).


The All-Russia Conference of Front and Rear Military Organisations
of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) was held in Petrograd from June 16 to 23
(June 29 to July 6), 1917. It was attended by 107 delegates from 43 front
and 17 rear military Bolshevik organisations uniting almost 26,000 members
of the Party. It was called by the Organising Bureau of the Central
Committee Military Organisation. On its agenda were these questions:
reports from the localities; attitude to the resolutions of the Seventh
(April) Conference; the present situation; organisation of power and the
Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies; the war, the peace and the
offensive; the agrarian question and others.  

Lenin gave reports on the present situation and on the agrarian
question. The conference recognised the need to replace the standing army
by armed workers’ battalions of the Red Guard placed at the disposal of the
elected workers’ organisations, and to replace the police by the people’s
militia (see K.P.S.S. v resolutsiyakh ..., Part I,
pp. 354–67). The conference decided to regard the newspaper
Soldatskaya Pravda as the Central Organ of the military
organisations of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.), approved the draft Rules for the
Military Organisation and elected the All-Russia Central Bureau of Military
Organisations consisting of M. S. Kedrov, N. V. Krylenko, V. I. Nevsky,
N. I. Podvoisky and others. The conference was of great importance in
strengthening the ties between the proletariat and the soldier mass and
helped to extend the work of the Bolsheviks among the soldiers.

1. The counter-revolution has become organised and
consolidated, and has actually taken state power into its
hands.{2} 

The complete organisation and consolidation of the counter-revolution
consists in a combination of its three

    

main forces, a combination excellently conceived and already put into
practice:
(1) The Constitutional-Democratic Party, i.e., the real leader of the
organised bourgeoisie, has, by withdrawing from the Cabinet, confronted it
with an ultimatum, thus clearing the way for the Cabinet’s overthrow by the
counter-revolution;
(2) The General Staff and the military leaders, with the deliberate or
semi-deliberate assistance of Kerensky, whom even the most prominent
Socialist-Revolutionaries now call a Cavaignac, have seized actual state
power and have proceeded to shoot down revolutionary units at the front,
disarm the revolutionary troops and workers in Petrograd and Moscow,
suppress unrest in Nizhny Novgorod, arrest Bolsheviks and ban their papers,
not only without trial, but even without a government order. At present,
basic state power in Russia is virtually a military dictatorship. This fact
is still obscured by a number of institutions that are revolutionary in
words but powerless in deeds. Yet it is so obvious and fundamental a fact
that, without understanding it, one can not understand anything about the
political situation.
(3) The Black-Hundred-monarchist and bourgeois press, which has switched
from hounding Bolsheviks to hounding the Soviets, the “incendiary”
Chernov, etc., has indicated with the utmost clarity that the true meaning
of the policy of military dictatorship, which now reigns supreme and is
supported by the Cadets and monarchists, is preparation for disbanding the
Soviets. Many of the leaders of the S.R.s and Mensheviks, i.e., the present
majority in the Soviets, have admitted and expressed this during the past
few days, but true to their petty-bourgeois nature, they shrug off this
formidable reality with meaningless high-sounding phrases.  

2. The leaders of the Soviets and of the Socialist-Revolutionary and
Menshevik parties, headed by Tsereteli and Chernov, have completely
betrayed the cause of the revolution by putting it in the hands of the
counter-revolutionaries and by turning themselves, their parties and the
Soviets into mere fig-leaves of the counter-revolution.  

Proof of this is that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks have
betrayed the Bolsheviks and have tacitly agreed to close down their papers
without daring to tell

    

the people plainly and openly that they are doing so and why. By
sanctioning the disarming of the workers and the revolutionary regiments,
they have deprived themselves of all real power. They have turned into the
most loud-mouthed ranters who help the reaction to “divert” the people’s
attention until it is finally ready to disband the Soviets. It is
impossible to understand anything at all about the present political
situation without realising this complete and final bankruptcy of the S.R.s
and Mensheviks and the present majority in the Soviets and without
realising that their “Directory” and other masquerades are an absolute
sham.  

3. All hopes for a peaceful development of the Russian revolution have
vanished for good. This is the objective situation: either complete victory
for the military dictator ship, or victory for the workers’ armed uprising;
the latter victory is only possible when it coincides with a deep mass
upheaval, against the government and the bourgeoisie caused by economic
disruption and the prolongation of the war.  

The slogan “All Power to the Soviets!” was a slogan for peaceful
development of the revolution which was possible in April, May, June, and
up to July 5–9, i.e., up to the time when actual power passed into the
hands of the military dictatorship. This slogan is no longer correct, for
it does not take into account that power has changed hands and that the
revolution has in fact been completely betrayed by the S.R.s and
Mensheviks. Reckless actions, revolts, partial resistance, or hopeless
hit-and-run attempts to oppose reaction will not help. What will help is a
clear understanding of the situation, endurance and determination of the
workers’ vanguard, preparation of forces for the armed uprising, for the
victory of which conditions at present are extremely difficult, but still
possible if the facts and trends mentioned in the thesis coincide. Let us
have no constitutional or republican illusions of any kind, no more
illusions about a peaceful path, no sporadic actions, no yielding
now  to provocation from the Black Hundreds and Cossacks. Let us
muster our forces, reorganise them and resolutely prepare for the armed
uprising, if the course of the crisis permits it on a really mass,
country-wide scale. The transfer of land to the peasants is impossible at
present

    

without an armed uprising, since the counter-revolutionaries, having taken
power, have completely united with the landowners as a class.  

The aim of the insurrection can only be to transfer power to the
proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, with a view to putting our
Party programme into effect.  

4. The party of the working class, without abandoning legal activity
but never for a moment overrating it, must  c o m b i n e  legal
with illegal work, as it did in 1912–14.  

Don’t let a single hour of legal work slip by. But don’t cherish any
constitutional or “peaceful” illusions. Form illegal organisations or
cells everywhere and at once for the publication of leaflets,
etc. Reorganise immediately, consistently, resolutely, all along the line.


Act as we did in 1912–14, when we could speak about overthrowing
tsarism by a revolution and an armed uprising, without at the same time
losing our legal base in the Duma, the insurance societies, the trade
unions, etc.  
 

Notes
 
 



{1}

The theses were written by Lenin on July 10 (23), 1917, and defined the
new tactical line of the Bolshevik Party in connection with

   

the changed political situation following the fusillade of the workers’ and
soldiers’ demonstration on July 4 (17) and the transfer of all power into
the hands of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. The theses
were discussed at an Enlarged Conference of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) together with representatives of the St. Petersburg
Committee, the Military Organisation of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) Central
Committee, the Moscow Regional Bureau, the Moscow Committee and the Moscow
District Committee, held on July 13 and 14 (26–27), 1917.  

The theses were published in the form of an article tinder the title
“Political Mood” on August 2 (July 20), 1917, in the newspaper
Proletarskoye Dyelo. It was the organ of the Bolshevik group of
the Kronstadt Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and was published
in place of the Bolshevik newspaper Golos Pravdy, Hosed down in
July by the Provisional Government. When the manuscript was being prepared
for the press, the subtitle “Four Theses” and points 1, 2, 3, 4, the
words “in the thesis” and also the end of the article (beginning with the
words “Form illegal organisations...)



were deleted; the words “armed uprising” were replaced by the words
“resolute struggle”.  

The manuscript heading also contained the word “latest” in front of
the words “Political Situation”, which was also crossed out, but there is
no certainty that it was done in connection with the publication of the
document in the legal press since in that case the word “situation” would
have been replaced by the word “mood”. It should also be borne in mind
that Lenin himself later mentioned in his “Aide memoire”

(see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol. 34,
pp. 443–44)

his theses on “the political situation” (and not “the latest political
situation”). Finally, this document, since its first publication as
belonging to Lenin (1925), has gone down in the Party history and is known
to everyone precisely as “The Political Situation”. Accordingly, the word
“latest” has not been restored in Vol. 34 of the Fifth Russian edition of
the Collected Works.

p. 440

Full power passed into the hands of the counter-revolutionary
Provisional Government after the events of July 3–5, which were an
expression of the most profound political crisis gripping the country. The
failure of the Russian offensive at the front started by Kerensky on
June 18 (31), the fresh sacrifices made for the benefit of the
imperialists, the growth of unemployment in view of the closure of
enterprises by the capitalists, the growing cost of living and the acute
shortage of the foodstuffs caused an explosion of indignation among the
broad masses of workers and soldiers over the counter-revolutionary policy
of the Provisional Government. On July 3 (16) spontaneous demonstrations
developed and threatened to grow into an armed uprising against the
Provisional Government.  

At the moment, the Bolshevik Party was against any armed action, for it
believed that the revolutionary crisis had not yet matured, and that the
army and the provinces were not yet ready

   

to support the uprising in the capital. A meeting of the Central Committee
held on July 3 (16) together with the St. Petersburg Committee and the
Military Organisation of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) Central Committee, decided to
refrain from taking any action. A similar decision was also taken by the
Second Petrograd City Conference of the Bolsheviks then in session. The
delegates went to the districts to restrain the masses from taking
action. But it had already begun and it proved impossible to stop it.  

In view of the mood of the masses, the Central Committee, together with
the St. Petersburg Committee and the Military Organisation, late at night
on July 3 (16), decided to participate in the demonstration on July 4 (17)
so as to lend it a peaceful and organised character. At the time, Lenin was
away: he was ill due to overwork and had gone to the countryside for a few
days’ rest. When he was informed of the events, he returned to Petrograd on
the morning of July 4 (17) and took over direction of the events.  

More than 500,000 took part in the demonstration on July 4 (17). It was
staged under Bolshevik slogans: “All power to the Soviets!” and
others. The demonstrators nominated 90 representatives, who handed to the
Central Executive Committee of the Soviets a demand for the transfer of all
the power to the Soviets.  However, the S. R. and Menshevik leaders refused
to take over.  

With the knowledge and consent of the Menshevik-S.R. Central Executive
Committee, the Provisional Government decided to suppress the demonstration
by armed force. Military cadet and counter-revolutionary Cossack regiments
were thrown against the peaceable demonstration of workers and
soldiers. They opened fire on the demonstrators. Reactionary-minded
military units were summoned from the front.  

The conference of members of the C.C. and the St. Petersburg Committee,
held under Lenin’s direction on the night of July 4 (17), decided to stop
the demonstration in an organised manner. This was a correct step taken by
the Party, which succeeded in retreating at a right time and preserving the
main forces of the revolution from being routed.  

After the dispersal of the demonstration, the bourgeois Provisional
Government continued its reprisals. It attacked the Bolshevik Party with
special ferocity. The Bolshevik newspapers Pravda, Soldatskaya
Pravda and others were closed down. Workers were disarmed, and
arrests, searches and pogroms followed. The revolutionary units of the
Petrograd garrison which had taken part in the demonstration were disbanded
and sent to the front. The Mensheviks and S.R.s were accomplices of the
counter-revolutionary butchers.

This leaflet cannot, of course, be published legally, but
everything must be done to have it published illegally. It would be
extremely stupid of us to jeopardise our legal newspapers (which are so
terribly important for us, and which it has taken such a great effort to
keep going) and fail to do what we had managed to do in 1912–14: to use
our legal possibilities. We should neither print the article (leaflet)
legally nor spoil it by rewriting it for legal publication.  

It would be not only stupid but base on our part to confine
ourselves to the legal word, when its freedom has so drastically been
curtailed by the government and is being further curtailed from day to day.


I am aware that the sluggishness of our Bolsheviks is

    

great and that it will take a great deal of effort to secure the
publication of illegal leaflets. But I shall go on insisting because those
are the demands of life, the demands of the movement.  

We must issue illegally free leaflets and handbills which are not
curtailed and which speak out at the top of their voice. They should be
signed: “A group of persecuted Bolsheviks”. We can confine ourselves to
that signature or add below in small type: “The group of persecuted
Bolsheviks consists of those Bolsheviks whom the government’s persecution
has forced to work illegally.” Or: “The group of persecuted Bolsheviks
consists of Bolsheviks whom the government’s persecution and withdrawal of
press freedom have forced to publish free leaflets illegally, and to act
outside the framework of the legal Bolshevik Party.”  
 LEAFLET ON THE CAPTURE OF RIGA 


   Workers, soldiers and all working people!  

   The enemy troops have taken Riga. We have suffered
   another heavy defeat. The incredible calamities inflicted on the people by
   the war are being aggravated and dragged out.  

   Why is the war being dragged out? The reason is still a
   division of the spoils between the capitalist brigands, the point at issue
   is still whether the German capitalist predators will retain Belgium,
   Serbia, Poland, Riga, etc., whether the British capitalist

   p a ors [predators]

   will retain Baghdad and the German colonies they have seized, whether the
   Russian capitalist predators will retain Armenia, etc. The Kerensky
   government, with the participation and support of the Mensheviks and the
   S.R.s, has been brazenly cheating the people, lulling them with empty talk
   about their desire for peace, talk which is not binding in any way, while
   actually dragging out the predatory war, and refusing to publish the secret
   treaties which the tsar concluded with the British and French capitalists
   for the enrichment of the Russian capitalists who had been promised
   Constantinople, Galicia and Armenia.  

   Even under the Republic, the Russian people are shedding
   their blood for the fulfilment of the secret treaties, the predatory
   treaties between the capitalists.  

   For months, the “republicans”, Kerensky, Skobelev,
   Chernov & Co., have been cheating the Russian workers and peasants,
   instead of abrogating the secret predatory treaties, instead of offering
   precise, clear-cut and fair peace terms to all the belligerent nations.
   

   Kerensky together with the Mensheviks and the S.R.s has
   cheated the people. Only a workers’ government can save the country, and
   safeguard it from the losses of the war and the plunder of the capitalist
   marauders.  
 

   In connection with the Riga defeat, the bourgeoisie is
   already anticipating the introduction of new harsh laws and strict
   disciplinary measures against soldiers, workers and peasants. Already the
   peasants are being deprived of their grain, while, through the blocking of
   workers’ control, the capitalists are allowed to retain their outrageously
   high profits and to safeguard their sacrosanct “commercial secrets”,
   which shield the bankers and millionaires from exposure.  

   Meanwhile, the Mensheviks and the S.R.s, disgracefully
   crawling to the bourgeoisie, continue to give it their support and shout
   about the need to “leave off” “all party strife”, which means leaving
   full power in the hands of the capitalists, and the country’s continued
   plunder by them, and leaving them the “freedom” to protract the war....
   

   Tens and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the
   offensive, which the Kerensky, Menshevik, and S.R. government started in
   June. Tens and hundreds of thousands will die in the protracted war, so
   long as the people continue to tolerate such a government.  

   Only a workers’ government can save the country. It alone
   will not cheat the people, but will immediately offer to all countries
   precise, clear-cut and fair peace terms.  

   The bourgeoisie has been trying to intimidate the people
   and create a panic, in an effort to get the ignorant people to believe that
   peace cannot be offered right away, as this would mean “losing Riga” and
   so on. That is cheating the people.  

   Even if peace were to be negotiated by the governments,
   i.e., the governments safeguarding the sacred rights of the capitalists to
   their plundered wealth and seizures of foreign lands (annexations), even
   then the offer of peace would not mean abandonment of Riga. Riga is the
   booty of the German capitalist brigands. Armenia is the booty of the
   Russian capitalist brigands. When brigands negotiate on peace they either
   each keep their own booty or swap pieces of it. That is how all wars have
   ended and will end, so long as power remains in the hands of the
   capitalists.  

   But we speak of a workers’ government which
   alone can offer just peace terms right away, and this has been stated
   hundreds of times by workers and peasants throughout Russia in their
   countless man dates and resolutions. These terms are: peace without
   annexations, i.e., without the seizure of foreign lands. This means:
   neither the Germans nor the Russians will be able forcibly, without the
   voluntary consent of the Poles, to integrate Poland or the Latvian
   Territory; neither the Turks nor the Russians will be able to seize
   Armenia, and so on.  

   These just peace terms will at once be offered by a
   workers’ government to all the belligerent countries without
   exception. Until this has been done, until precise, clear-cut, formal
   proposals of peace have been made, until there has been an overthrow of the
   total power of the marauding capitalists, who are making hundreds of
   millions on war contracts, and so long as the secret predatory treaties
   remain intact—all talk of peace comes to nothing but gross and utterly
   shameless deception of the people.  

   All the capitalist governments, including the Kerensky,
   S. R. and Menshevik government, have been practising this deception

    

   of the people. They have all been mouthing phrases of peace, which are not
   binding in any way, no one has been offering any precise peace terms, no
   one has abrogated the secret treaties, and in fact everyone has continued
   to drag out the criminal predatory war over the capitalists’ profits, which
   is mining the peoples.  

   Down with the war! Down with the Kerensky, Menshevik and
   S.R. government, which is cheating the people, protracting the war,
   safeguarding the predatory interests of the capitalists, putting off the
   elections to the Constituent Assembly!  

   Only a workers’ government supported by the poor peasants
   will offer peace, putting an end to the capitalist plunder, and give the
   working people bread and freedom. Let every worker and soldier explain to
   the people the need to overthrow the Kerensky government and set up a
   workers’ government.

The list of candidates published by the Central Committee
has been compiled in an inadmissible manner and calls for the sharpest
protest. The point is that there must be four or five times more workers in
a peasant Constituent Assembly, because they alone are capable of
establishing close and intimate ties with the peasant deputies. It is
absolutely inadmissible also to have an excessive number of candidates from
among people who have but recently joined our Party and have not yet been
tested (like Larin). In filling the list with such candidates who should
first have worked in the Party for months and months, the C.C. has thrown
wide open the door for careerists who scramble for seats in the Constituent
Assembly. There is need for an urgent review and correction of the list.

    

 NOTE TO THESIS “ON THE LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CONSTITUENT
ASSEMBLY” 

It goes without saying that from among the
mezhraiontsi{4} who have been hardly tested in proletarian work in our
Party’s spirit, no one would contest the candidature of, say,
Trotsky, for, first, upon his arrival, Trotsky at once took up an
internationalist stand; second, he worked among the mezhraiontsi for a
merger; third, in the difficult July days he proved himself equal to the
task and a loyal supporter of the party of the revolutionary
proletariat. Clearly, as much cannot be said about many of the new Party
members entered on the list.  

Larin’s nomination is especially scandalous (apart from his being
placed ahead of Petrovsky, Krylenko and others...). During the war, Larin
helped the chauvinists, spoke on their behalf at the
Swedish congress, and helped to print lies against the St. Petersburg
workers and their boycott of the War Industries Committees. During the war,
before the revolution, Larin did not once show himself to be a
fighter for internationalism. Upon his return to Russia, Larin
long helped the Mensheviks and even came out in the press with indecent
attacks against, our Party, in the Alexinsky spirit. Larin is well known
for his “swings”: let us recall his pamphlet on the labour congress and
on a merger with the S.R.s.  

Of course, there would be no need to recall all this if Larin entered
the Party with a desire to reform. But to get him into the Constituent
Assembly within a week or so of his entry into the Party is in
fact to transform the Party into the same kind of dirty stall for
careerists as most of the European parties
 are.[1]


The serious work in the Constituent Assembly will consist in
establishing close, intimate ties with the peasants. Only workers
who are in touch with peasant life are fit for this. To pack the
Constituent Assembly with orators and

    

writers is to take the beaten track of opportunism and chauvinism. That is
unworthy of the “Third International”.

What about M.N. Pokrovsky’s candidature? In 1907, he moved away from
the Bolsheviks and remained on the sidelines for years. It would be a good
thing if he came back for good. But this has first to be proved by long
effort.  —Lenin

The theses were first published in full in Vol. 34 of the Fifth Russian
edition of the Collected Works. The First edition of the

   

Collected Works (Vol. 14, Part II), and the Fourth edition of the
Collected Works (Vol. 26), did not contain the section “On the
List of Candidates for the Constituent Assembly” and the note to it. In
Vol. 21 of the Second and Third editions of the Collected Works it
was published in part.  

The Third Petrograd City Conference was held from October 7 to
11 (20 to 24), 1917. It was attended by 92 delegates with vote and
40 delegates with voice only. Lenin was elected honorary chairman. Lenin’s
theses were the basis of the Conference decisions. In a resolution on the
present situation, the Conference declared the need to replace the Kerensky
government by a workers’ and peasants’ revolutionary government, for only
such a government could give land to the peasants and take the country out
of the war and the ruin, The Conference adopted resolutions “On the Red
Guard” and “On the Hunger Strike by Political Prisoners in the Case of
July 3 (16)-5 (18)”. Its decisions emphasised that the country was on the
eve of a massive proletarian uprising and expressed the firm conviction
that the uprising would be victorious. The Conference discussed the
question of elections to the Constituent Assembly, Lenin being among the
first candidates nominated from Petrograd. The sitting on October 11 (24)
heard Lenin’s “Letter to the Petrograd City Conference”

(see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 145–48).

The Conference played a very important part in the preparation of the Great
October Socialist Revolution.

The Provisional Government announced the convocation of the Constituent
Assembly in its Declaration of March 2 (15), 1917. On June 14 (27), the
Provisional Government adopted a decision appointing the elections to the
Constituent Assembly on September 17 (30). But in August it postponed the
elections until November 12 (25).  

The elections were held after the victory of the October Socialist
Revolution, on the appointed day. Polling took place by lists drawn up
before the October Revolution an under the statute approved by the
Provisional Government. A considerable section of the people had not yet
had time to grasp the full significance of the socialist revolution, which
was used by the Right-wing S.R.s, who managed to win majorities in
gubernias and regions, far away from the capital and industrial
centres. The Constituent Assembly was convened by the Soviet Government and
opened in Petrograd on January 5 (18), 1918. The counter-revolutionary
majority of the Constituent Assembly rejected the “Declaration of the
Rights of the Working and Exploited People” which was placed before it by
the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, and refused to recognise the
Soviet power. The bourgeois Constituent Assembly was dissolved by a decree
of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on January 6 (10).

Mezhraiontsi—members of the Inter-District Organisation of
the United Social-Democrats which arose in St. Petersburg in November 1913
with the idea of working for R.S.D.L.P. unity. Behind

   

the slogan of unity, and in an effort to merge the Bolshevik and the
Menshevik organisations in St. Petersburg, the mezhraiontsi actually set up
their own factional organisation, which included Trotskyite Mensheviks and
also a section of former Bolsheviks who took a conciliatory attitude
towards the opportunists.  

During the First World War, the mezhraiontsi adopted a Centrist stand;
they recognised the war as imperialist and opposed social-chauvinism; but
did not agree to a full break-away from the Mensheviks. In 1917, the
mezhraiontsi organisation, which included A. Joffe, A. Lunacharsky,
D. Manuilsky, L. Trotsky, M. Uritsky, V. Volodarsky and I. Yurenev,
announced its agreement with the Bolshevik Party line. At the Sixth
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) the mezhraiontsi organisation (almost 4,000
members) broke away from the Menshevik defencists and was admitted to the
Bolshevik Party. Subsequent events showed that some mezhraiontsi (including
Lunacharsky, Manuilsky, Volodarsky and Uritsky) did in fact break with
their Centrist past and became prominent members of the Bolshevik
Party. But Trotsky, even after he entered the Bolshevik Party, did not
become a Bolshevik and carried on a secret and open struggle against
Leninism and the Party’s policy. He became the bitterest enemy of Leninism,
the Soviet state and the entire international communist movement.  

The mezhraiontsi published their own periodical—the journal
Vperyod (one issue appeared in 1915 illegally). Its publication
was resumed in 1917: from June to August it was published legally as the
organ of the St. Petersburg Inter-District Committee of the United
Social-Democrats (internationalists); there were 8 issues. After the Sixth
Party Congress, the Editorial Board was changed and No. 9 appeared as an
organ of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)  Central Committee. In September its
publication was discontinued under a Central Committee decision.

## “The Landowners Have Hit It Off With the Cadets”

That is not our expression. It was used by the newspaper
Dyelo
Naroda{2} No. 170 of October 3, quoting the words of “a
provincial worker” who described what had happened in Russia in the summer
and autumn of 1917. Dyelo Naroda is known to be the chief official
organ of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Former Minister Chernov is on
its Editorial Board.  

The admission of such a paper is especially valuable. Here it is: 


   “The landowners have hit it off with the Cadets,
   according to a provincial worker. In plainer language, this means that the
   landowners have found sympathy and support among some elements of the
   government in the centre and in the localities, that they have recovered
   from the first shock and have started to organise.... Attacks on the land
   committees have started and have been growing from day to day, first in the
   form of a cornucopia of complaints and wails about ‘robberies’, ‘arbitrary
   acts’, and ‘pogroms’.... The complaints were followed by restrictive
   circulars from above and judicial prosecution of the land committees, and
   in the localities close to the front, also by interference from the
   military authorities in the form of orders issued by General Kornilov. Even
   here, in Petrograd, the Ministry of Justice has also threatened to
   institute criminal proceedings against the Chief Land Committee.  

   “The cancellation of pre-revolutionary leasehold
   contracts is the most frequent pretext for the commission for trial and the
   filing of civil suits. The landowners and all those who are with them have
   been saying in one voice: the law on contracts has not been rescinded,
   which means that all the contracts are still valid, and ‘no committees or
   private persons’ have the right to cancel them.... So the ‘unwary’
   committees are being massively struck down by the old justice for
   cancelling the contracts and reducing the leasehold prices. The fact is,
   however, that such reductions are absolutely inevitable and hardly any
   contract has remained intact anywhere.”  

 

(The paper goes on to give the evidence of a “most moderate Professor
Kablukov” who says that the short-term peasant tenant is sometimes
“worse off than the serf...”)  


   “In these circumstances, cancellation of the shackling
   leasehold contracts, concluded before the revolution, far from being a
   crime, was a direct duty of the organs of power.... The effort to keep a
   section of the peasant tenants ‘worse off than the serfs’ at any price was
   a downright provocation to riot, a provocation which was the more criminal
   in that it was carried out exclusively in the interests of the class of
   feudal-minded landowners, and at a time when the republic and the whole
   people are suffering the greatest calamities.... It is no accident, after
   all, that pogroms have broken out and the ‘nests’ of the gentry are in
   flames precisely in Tambov Gubernia, where the number of committees put on
   trial is great 


That is what is said in the newspaper Dyelo Naroda, the
official organ of the ministerial party of S.R.s.  

These lines should be reprinted everywhere, issued as leaflets, and
circulated in millions of copies among the peasants, because they contain
proof, given by the S.R.s (Socialist-Revolutionaries) themselves and quoted
by V. Chernov’s own paper, proof that the S.R.s have betrayed the
peasants to the landowners, that the S.R. Party has betrayed the
peasantry, and that if it has not also “hit it off” with the
landowners, it has at any rate surrendered to them.  

The people must be given the chance to read and reread these
lines. Every class-conscious peasant, soldier and worker must give thought
to the meaning of these admissions.  

Seven months of the revolution have passed. Countless times the people
have expressed their confidence in the S.R.s, have given them majorities at
elections, and said to the S.R. Party: lead on, we entrust you with the
leadership! Since March 1917, the S.R. Party in the Soviets of Workers’,
Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies has been operating in a bloc (alliance)
with the Mensheviks, and has had a majority for months
and months!  Since May 6, members of the Party of S.R.s and Mensheviks have
been and still are ministers and deputy ministers
together with the “despicable Cadets”, alongside the
“despicable Cadets”, in alliance with the “despicable
Cadets”!!  
 

Dyelo Naroda has itself admitted the results of this coalition
(alliance, agreement) with the despicable Cadets and the
landowners.  

Seven months of the revolution, seven months of the democratic
republic, seven months of S.R. and Menshevik domination in the Soviets have
resulted in a “vast” number of members of the land committees put
on trial—trial under the old justice, by the old courts, by
the tsarist-landowner courts; they have resulted in peasant
revolts in Tambov and other gubernias!  

That is the result of the peasants’ trusting the S.R. Party. Meanwhile,
the new draft land bill of the S.R. Minister S. L. Maslov shows again and
again how the S.R.s have betrayed the peasants (see article by this author:
“Socialist-Revolutionary Party Cheats the Peasants Once
       Again”{1}

).

Dyelo Naroda (The People’s Cause)—a daily, the organ of the
S.R. Party, published in Petrograd from March 1917 to July 1918, repeatedly
under different names. It took a defencist and conciliatory stand, and
supported the bourgeois Provisional Government. Its publication was resumed
in Samara in October 1918 (four issues) and in Moscow in March 1919 (ten
issues). The paper was closed down for its counter-revolutionary activity.

To Comrade Sverdlov. 

I learnt only last night that Zinoviev had issued a writ ten
denial of his participation in Kamenev’s statement in Novaya
Zhizn.  

Why then have you not sent me anything???  

I sent all the letters about Kamenev and Zinoviev to C.C. members
only.—You know this; is it not strange then that you seem to doubt it?


It looks as if I will not be able to attend the Plenary Meeting,
because “they are looking for me”. If you (+ Stalin, Sokolnikov
and Dzerzhinsky) demand a compromise on the Zinoviev and Kamenev
affair,{1} enter a proposal against me, to have the case
referred to a Party court (the facts are clear that Zinoviev was also
thwarting it deliberately); this will be a postponement.  
 

“Kamenev’s resignation has been accepted”? From the C.C.? Please let
me have the text of his statement.  /p>



Cancellation of the Cossacks’ demonstration is a great
victory.{2} Hurrah! If we  a t t a c k  with
a l l  o u r  s t r e n g t h,  we shall fully win out in a few
days! Best regards! Yours.

A reference to the speeches of Y. M. Sverdlov, J. V. Stalin,
F. E. Dzerzhinsky and G. Y. Sokolnikov at the Central Committee’s sitting
on October 20 (November 2), 1917, during the discussion of Lenin’s letter
to the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)

(see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 192–96)

in connection with the publication in the semi-Menshevik newspaper
Novaya Zhizn of an item entitled “Y. Kamenev on the
‘Uprising’\thinspace”, in which Kamenev, on behalf of Zinoviev and
himself, opposed the armed uprising. See Protokoly Tsentralnogo
Komiteta R.S.D.R.P.(B.). Avgust 1917–fevral 1918 (Minutes of the

The Cossack demonstration, or the Cossack “religious procession”, in
Petrograd was set for October 22 (November 4), 1917, and was regarded by
the counter-revolutionaries as a show of force in their struggle against
the mounting revolution. The Bolsheviks carried on extensive agitation
among the Cossacks urging them to refrain from taking part in the
demonstration. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
issued an appeal to the Cossacks. Representatives of the Cossack regiments
were invited to a conference of regimental committees held by the Petrograd
Soviet in Smolny on October 21 (November 3). At the conference, the
Cossacks declared that they would not act against the workers and
soldiers. The night before the demonstration, the Provisional Government
was forced to call it off.
