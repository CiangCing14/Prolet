You are probably cursing me for this delay. There were some good reasons
for it.


I will recount them in order. First of all, I was in

Vilna.[1]

I had talks with our people about the

Miscellany.[5]

Most of them are agreed on the need for such a publication and promise
support and supply of material. Their mood is in general sceptical (I
recalled your expression about the

pal.[2]

provinces), as much as to say—we shall see whether it will correspond to
agitational tactics, to the tactics of the economic struggle. I stressed
that this would largely depend on us.


Further, I was in Moscow. I saw no one, for there was no trace of the
“Teacher of Life”. Is he all right? If you know anything about him and
have an address, write to him to send it to us, otherwise we cannot find
any contacts there. Great havoc has been played

there,[6]

but it seems that some people have survived and the work did not cease. We
have material from there—a description of some strikes. If you have not
had it, write and we shall send it to you.


After that I was in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. Places like this, frequently to be met
with in the central industrial area, are extremely peculiar: a purely
manufacturing town with tens of thousands of inhabitants, whose only means
of livelihood is the mills. The mill management is the sole authority. The
mill office “runs” the town. There is the sharpest division of the people
into workers and bourgeois. Hence

    

the workers’ frame of mind is rather oppositional, but, after the recent
smash-up there, so few of our people are left and all of them so closely
watched that contacts are very difficult. However, we shall be able to
deliver the literature.


Further, the delay has been due to local trouble. This also accounts for
the meagreness of the material sent.


I don’t like the address in Zurich. Can’t you find another—not in
Switzerland, but in Germany? That would be much better and safer.


Further, in sending your reply—a book on technology, address:
Mr. Luchinsky, Alexandrovsky Iron Works, Chemical Laboratory,
St. Petersburg—add, if there is room, other material: pamphlets issued in
Geneva, interesting cuttings from

Vorwärts,[7]

etc. Write in detail about the Miscellany: what material there is already,
what is planned, when the first issue will appear, and what exactly is
lacking for the second. We shall probably send money, but later on. Reply
as quickly as possible so that we may know whether this method is
suitable.


Send the Pole a rendezvous address as quickly as possible, since we need
delivery facilities. The address is: student Mikhail Leontievich Zakladny,
Technological Institute, the same town, ask for Ivanov. The money for the
publication in Russian of his Geschichte, etc., has been

promised.[3]


Another request: we are badly in need of ink; as to what kind, you can find
out from Mögli, who has it. Could you send it somehow? Is there no
opportunity? Please think it over or ask your “practical men” to do
so. By the way, you asked us to approach them directly. In that case, tell
us: 1) do they know our method and key? 2) do they know who these letters
come from?


You are now being sent: 1) information about the expulsion of the
Dukhobors; 2) an account about rural workers in the south; and 3) a
description of the Thornton mills—for the time being, only the beginning,
about a quarter, of this is being sent.

 

It is necessary to write with Chinese ink. Better still, add
a small crystal of potassium dichromate (K_2Cr_2O_7): then it
won’t wash off. Use the thinnest paper possible. All the
best.


Yours....


Regards to the comrade.

 

Notes
 

[1]
The key is the same as the one we have been

using.[8]—Lenin

[2]
The word “pal.” has not been deciphered.—Ed. 

[3]
The publication and its author have not been
ascertained.—Ed.
 



[4]
Axelrod, Pavel Borisovich (1850-1928)—in the seventies
a Narodnik, later a Marxist. in 1883 took part in founding the
Emancipation of Labour group. From 1900 a member of the editorial
board of Iskra and Zarya. After the Second Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P. (1903), a Menshevik leader.


During the period of reaction (1907-10) one of the leading
liquidators. Adopted a hostile attitude towards the October Socialist
Revolution. p. 20




[8]
This footnote was given by Lenin in view of the fact that the names of
towns were ciphered in the letter for purposes of secrecy. p. 20




[5]
This refers to the preparations for publishing abroad a non-periodical
Miscellany entitled Rabotnik. It was published in 1896-99 by
the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and edited by the
Emancipation of Labour group. The publication was sponsored by
Lenin. In May 1895, during his stay in Switzerland, Lenin made
arrangements for its publication with G. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod
and other members of the Emancipation of Labour group. On his return
to Russia in September 1895 Lenin developed extensive activities aimed
at supplying articles from Russia for the Miscellany and organising
financial support for the publication. During his trips to Vilna,
Moscow and Orekhovo-Zuyevo Lenin made arrangements with the local
Social-Democrats for assistance to be rendered this publication.


Altogether 6 issues of Rabotnik in three volumes and 10
issues of Listok Rabotnika were published. p. 20




[6]
This refers to the arrests made among the Social-Democrats in Moscow
and Moscow Gubernia. p. 20




[7]
Vorwärts—a daily, central organ of the German
Social-Democratic Party, published in Berlin from 1891. In the late
nineties, after the death of Engels, the paper was controlled by the
Party’s Right wing and systematically published articles of the
opportunists. Vorwärts tendentiously reported the
struggle against opportunism and revisionism within the R.S.D.L.P. and
supported the Economists, and later, after the split in the Party, the
Mensheviks. p. 21

We have received the Breslau
report.[2]
We unstuck it with great difficulty, in the course of which a large part
was torn (the letter, thanks to the good paper, remained intact). Evidently
you have not yet received the second letter. You must use very thin
paste—not more than a teaspoonful of starch (and it must be potato
starch, not wheat starch, which is too strong) to a glass of
water. Ordinary (good) paste is needed only for the top sheet and coloured
paper, and the paper holds well, under the action of a press, even with the
thinnest paste. At any rate, the method is suitable and it should be used.


I am sending you the end of Thornton. We have material on the strike 1) at
Thornton’s, 2) at Laferm’s, 3) on the Ivanovo-Voznesensk strike, 4) on the
Yaroslavl strike (a worker’s letter, very interesting), and on the
St. Petersburg Boot Manufacturing Factory. I am not sending it, as we have
had no time yet to copy it and because I do not count on being in time for
the first issue of the Miscellany. We have established contacts with the
Narodnaya Volya
printing-press,[3]
which has already put out three things (not ours) and has taken one of
ours.[1]

We are planning to publish a
newspaper,[4]
in which this material will be printed. This will be definitely settled in
about 1 \frac1/2 to 2 months’ time. If you think the material will arrive in
time for the first issue, let us know at once.

Yours,
 Ilyin


Have you any difficulty in handling our parcels? We must jointly improve the method.

was compiled and edited by Lenin, who also wrote all the main
articles: the editorial “To the Russian Workers”,
“What Are Our Ministers Thinking About?”, “Frederick
Engels” (see present edition, Vol. 2). In addition the newspaper
contained articles by other members of the St. Petersburg League of
Struggle, such as G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, A. A. Vaneyev,
P. K. Zaporozhets, L. Martov (Y. O. Tsederbaum) and M. A. Silvin.


In his book What Is To be Done? Lenin wrote: “This
issue was ready to go to press when it was seized by the gendarmes, on
the night of December 8, 1895, in a raid on the house of one of the
members of the group, Anatoly Alexeyevich Vaneyev, so that the first
edition of Rabocheye Dyelo was not destined to see the light
of day” (see present edition, Vol. 5, p. 376). p. 23

Dear Pavel Borisovich,


I am very, very glad to have succeeded after all in getting a letter from
you (I received it yesterday, i. e., August 15) and news of you and of
G. V. Your and his opinions on my literary
efforts[1]

(for the workers) have been extremely encouraging. There is nothing I
have wanted so much, or dreamed of so much, as an opportunity of writing
for workers, But how to do this from here? It is very, very difficult,
but not impossible, I think. How is the health of V. Iv.?


I know only one method—the one by which I am writing these
lines.[3]
The question is whether it is possible to find a copyist, who will have no
easy task. You, apparently, consider it impossible and this method, in
general, unsuitable. But I do not know any other.\dots It is a pity, but I
do not despair: if one does not succeed now—one can succeed later
on. Meanwhile, it would be good if you were to write occasionally by the
method which you use with your “old
friend”.[4]
That will enable us to keep in touch, which is the most important thing.


You, of course, have been told enough about me, so there is nothing to
add. I live here all alone. I am quite well and occupy myself both with the
\n

journal[5]
and with my big
job. [2]


All the very best. Kind regards to V. Iv. and G. V. I have not seen Raichin
for over a month. I hope to go to Minusinsk soon to see him.

Yours,
 V. U.


August 16

September 2, 1898

Yesterday I received your letter of August l1 with the list of books and
the printed matter—the
Archiv.[6]
The article of the “eminent political economist” is highly
interesting and excellently composed. The author evidently disposed of
very rich material, which had luckily fallen into his hands. Generally
speaking, in the journalistic field, he appears to be even a better
writer than in the purely economic field. Archiv, in general,
is an interesting journal and I shall certainly subscribe to it for
next year. I should like also to subscribe to some English periodical
or newspaper (weekly); can you advise me which to select? I have no
idea what there is in the English publicistic field that is most
interesting and is available in Russia.


As regards Struve’s
article,[7]
on which we hold different opinions, it has to be said, of course,
that it is impossible to judge accurately of the author’s views from
it alone. It seemed to me, for instance, and still seems to me, that
he definitely set himself “general classificatory tasks” (the title
itself indicates this), whereas you consider that he set himself “no
such tasks”.\dots That “it is necessary to win our handicraft
workers away from so-called people’s industry” is something with
which, of course, I am wholly and definitely in agreement, and I think
that this still confronts our
“disciples”[8]
as an unsolved problem. It was in Struve’s article that I saw a
plan for solving this problem.


Have you paid attention to N. G.’s articles in Russkoye
\n

Bogatstvo[9]
(in the two last issues) against “materialism and dialectical
logic”. They are highly interesting—from the negative aspect. I
must admit that I am not competent

 

to deal with the questions raised by the author, and I am extremely
surprised that the author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des
Materialismus[1]

has not expressed his opinion in the Russian literature and does not
vigorously oppose neo-Kantianism, letting Struve and
Bulgakov[10]
polemise on specific questions of this philosophy, as if it had already
become part of the views of Russian
disciples.[11]
Space would surely be found for philosophical articles in more than one of
our periodicals; moreover, a book could get through easily. His polemic
with Bernstein and Conrad Schmidt interests me greatly, and I very much
regret that I am quite unable to obtain
Zeit.[12]
I should be greatly obliged to you if you could help me in this. It would
be quite sufficient, of course, to receive this journal even for a short
period. Do you have the issue of Die Neue Zeit (of a few years ago)
which carried an article by the same author on Hegel (the 30th anniversary
of his death—something of that
kind)?[13]
Neither I nor any of the comrades here get Die Neue Zeit, although
they promised to send it from St. Petersburg! The devil take all those
people who make promises and do not keep them!

Another interesting article is that of Ratner’s on Capital in
Russkoye Bogatstvo (for July). I cannot stand such lovers of the
golden mean, who do not dare to come out openly against doctrines with
which they have no sympathy, but wriggle, make “amendments”, evade the
main issues (such as the theory of the class struggle) and beat about the
bush of particulars.


The articles by another author in Die Neue Zeit on social trends
in Russia also sound very
interesting[14]:
your mentioning them is extremely tantalising. If I have understood you
rightly, this author expresses an idea already expounded by him elsewhere
(on the danger of einer politischen Isolierung des russischen
Proletariats[2]

). It seems to me that “alienation from society” does not necessarily
signify

“isolation ”,[3]

for there is society and society: in fighting
Narodism[15]
    

and all of its offshoots, the disciples thereby come closer to those
gauches[4]

who tend to break decisively with Narodism and adhere
consistently to their views. From such people the
disciples would hardly begin dissociating themselves unreservedly. Rather
the contrary. A “conciliatory” (or, rather, alliancist) attitude towards
such people is wholly compatible, in my opinion, with the fight against
Narodism and all its manifestations.


Please write. All the best.


V. Ulyanov


Well, well, you have already come to blows—and how!—with sticks and
what not! Fortunately, Eastern Siberia seems to be lagging somewhat behind
the Vyatka Gubernia in
bellicosity.[16]

[5]
Potresov, Alexander Nikolayevich (1869-1934)—joined the
Marxists in the nineties of the 19th century. For participating in the
St. Petersberg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working
Class, was exiled. In 1900 went abroad, where he took part in founding
Iskra and Zarya. After the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. (1903) joined the Mensheviks. During the years of reaction
(1907-10) was an ideologist of liquidationism; played a leading role
in the Menshevik publications Vosrozhdeniye, Nasha
Zarya, and others.


After the October he Revolution he emigrated. p. 25




[6]
This refers to the preparations for publishing abroad a non-periodical
Miscellany entitled Rabotnik. It was published in 1896-99 by
the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and edited by the
Emancipation of Labour group. The publication was sponsored by
Lenin. In May 1895, during his stay in Switzerland, Lenin made
arrangements for its publication with G. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod
and other members of the Emancipation of Labour group. On his return
to Russia in September 1895 Lenin developed extensive activities aimed
at supplying articles from Russia for the Miscellany and organising
financial support for the publication. During his trips to Vilna,
Moscow and Orekhovo-Zuyevo Lenin made arrangements with the local
Social-Democrats for assistance to be rendered this publication.


Altogether 6 issues of Rabotnik in three volumes and 10
issues of Listok Rabotnika were published. p. 20




[7]
Struve, Pyotr Bernhardovich (1870-1944)—a bourgeois
economist and publicist. In the nineties a leading spokesman of
“legal Marxism”, “suplemented” and criticised
the economic and philosophical theories of Marx, and tried to adapt
Marxism and the working-class movement to the interests of the
bourgeoisie; contributor to and editor of the journals Novoye
Slovo, Nachalo and Zhizn. Struve was one of the
theoreticians and organisers of the liberal-monarchist Osvobozhdeniye
League (1903-05). With the formation of the Cadet Party in
1905—a member of its Central Committee. After the October
Revolution—a white émigré. p. 25




[8]
Disciples—followers of Marx and Engels. This term was
used in the nineties as a legal designation for Marxists. p. 25




[9]
Russkoye Bogatstvo (Russian Wealth)—a monthly journal
published from 1876 to 1918 in St. Petersburg. In the early nineties
it passed into the bands of the liberal Narodniks headed by
N. K. Mikhailovsky. The journal advocated a conciliatory attitude
towards the tsarist government and conducted a bitter fight against
Marxism and the Russian Marxists. In 1906 it became the organ of the
semi-Cadet Trudovik Popular Socialist Party. p. 25




[10]
Bulgakov, Sergei Nikolayevich (1871-1944)—bourgeois
economist and idealist philosopher. In the nineties a “legal
Marxist”. Advocated a revision of Marx’s doctrine on the
agrarian question. After the Revolution of 1905-07 joined the Cadets,
preached philosophical mysticism, participated in the
counter-revolutionary miscellany Vekhi.


In 1922 he was deported for counter-revolutionary activities. p. 26




[11]
Lenin refers to the polemic between Bulgakov and Struve over the book
Wirtschaft und Recht nach der materialistischen
Geschicht-sauffassung by the German Kantian Stammler. p. 26




[12]
Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung—a daily, published in Cologne
from July 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, edited by K. Marx. “No German
newspaper, before or since,” wrote Engels, “has ever had the
same power and influence or been able to electrify the proletarian masses
as effectively as the Neue Rheinische Zeitung” (Marx and
Engels, Selected Works, Vol. 11, Moscow, 1962, pp. 336-37). In his
article “Karl Marx” Lenin called this newspaper “the
finest and unsurpassed organ of the revolutionary proletariat” (see
present edition, Vol. 21, p. 81). p. 82




[13]
The reference is to Plekhanov’s article “The Sixtieth
Anniversary of Hegel’s Death” in the journal Die Neue
Zeit Nos. 7, 8, 9 (1891-92. Band I).


Lenin’s reference to “the 30th anniversary” is
obviously a slip of the pen. p. 26




[14]
The reference is to Axelrod’s articles “Die historische
Berechtigung der russischen Sozialdemokratie” (later issued in
Russia as a separate pamphlet under the title The Historical
Position and the Mutual Relations between the Liberal and
Socialist Democracy in Russia), published in the journal
Die Neue Zeit No. 30 and No. 31 (1897-98. Band II).


Lenin’s comments on Axelrod’s articles will be found on
pp. 29-31 of this volume. p. 26




[17]
The reference is to Economism, an opportunist trend in Russian
Social-Democracy at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the
twentieth centuries. The Economists hold that the political struggle
against tsarism was mainly the business of the liberal bourgeoisie,
while the workers were to confine themselves to an economic struggle
for better working conditions, higher wages, etc. They denied the
leading role of the party of the working class and the significance of
revolutionary theory in the labour movement, and maintained that that
movement could only develop spontaneously. Lenin gave a devastating
criticism of Economism in his book What Is To Be Done? p. 26




[15]
Narodism—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian
revolutionary movement, which arose between the 1860s and 1870s. The
Narodniks were out to abolish the autocracy and hand over the
landowners’ land to the peasantry. At the same time they denied
the development of capitalist relations in Russia to be a natural
tendency, and accordingly regarded the peasantry, and not the
proletariat, as the main revolutionary force, and the village commune
as the embryo of socialism. With the object of rousing the peasants to
the struggle against the autocracy the Narodniks went into the
country, “among the people”, but gained no support there.


In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks took a conciliatory stand
towards tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulaks, and waged a
bitter fight against Marxism. p. 27




[16]
Lenin refers to the heated disputes between the Marxists and the
Narodniks that raged among the exiles. It was of one such clash in
Orlov, Vyatka Gubernia, that Potresov wrote to Lenin about. p. 27

January 26, 1899


I have received your letter of December 24. I am very glad that you have at
last got rid of your illness, of which rumours had even reached us. I heard
of it during the holidays while I was in Minusinsk, and kept thinking where
and how I could obtain news of you. (I thought it inconvenient to write to
you directly, as you were said to be seriously ill.)  Well, you have now
revived just in time for a literary undertaking which is also being
revived. Of course, you know already about
Nachalo[19],
which is to be started in the middle of February. I hope you have now fully
recovered—it is already a month since you wrote the last letter—and
that you will be able to work. You are probably fairly well provided for in
the matter of books and order the chief new ones? If you are not too short
of funds for ordering books, I think you can work even in the
backwoods—at least I judge by myself, comparing my life in Samara seven
years ago, when I was reading almost exclusively other people’s books, and
now, when I have begun to acquire the habit of ordering books.

It is admitted there that Skaldin is a Liberalkonservativ, that he
is “not typical”

    

of the sixties, that it is “inconvenient” to take “typical” writers; I
did not have Chernyshevsky’s articles and do not have them, moreover the
chief ones have still not been republished, and I should hardly be able to
avoid snags here. Furthermore, I would begin defending myself by pointing
to the fact that I gave an exact definition of what I understand by the
“heritage” of which I am speaking. Of course, if the article nevertheless
gives the impression that the author proposes to accept precisely Skaldin’s
heritage, this is a fault that cannot be remedied. I forgot what is perhaps
my chief “defence”, namely, that if Skaldin is a “rarity”, then
bourgeois liberalism, more or less consistent and free from Narodism, is by
no means a rarity, but a very broad trend of the sixties and seventies. You
retort: “Coincidence and continuity are poles apart”. But the crux of the
matter is that the article says it is necessary to purge bourgeois
liberalism of Narodism. If this is true and if it is feasible (a
particularly important condition!), then the result of the purge, the
residue after it, will be bourgeois liberalism that not only coincides with
Skaldin’s but is its successor. Thus, if I am accused of accepting
Skaldin’s heritage, I shall be entitled to answer that I am merely
undertaking to purge it of admixtures, but that I myself have
nothing to do with it and, in addition to cleaning various Augean stables,
have more congenial and more positive occupations.\dots Well, I’m afraid I
have lot myself be carried away and really imagine myself a “defendant”!


We have not corresponded for such a long time that to tell you the truth I
have forgotten when I last wrote you about the articles “Die
historische Berechtigung”. I believe I wrote before I received
them?[1]

Now I have read them and have found that the author’s main idea is fully
acceptable (especially at the end concerning the two extremes or snags that
have to be avoided). In giving the reasons, however, one should really
bring out more sharply the Klassencharakter of the
Bewegung[2]

of which the author speaks (he mentioned it, but only in passing and very
briefly), and furthermore not to regard the Fronde-like

    

agrarians with such favour; in their liberalism there is more of the Fronde
and of a sense of grievance on account of
einundsechzig[3]

than of a desire for “the most rapid industrialisation” of the
country. It is worth while recalling their attitudes towards seasonal
work, migration, etc. The author should have formulated the task more
accurately: to free all fortschrittliche
Strömungen[4]

from the rubbish of Narodism and agrarianism and to utilise all of
them in this purified form. In my opinion, “utilise” is a much more
exact and suitable word than Unterstützung und
Bundesgenossenschaft.[5]

The latter indicates the equality of these
Bundesgenossen,[6]

yet they must (in this I fully agree with you) follow in the wake,
sometimes even “with clenched teeth”; they have absolutely not grown so
far as to reach equality and will never grow to reach it, owing to their
cowardice, disunity, etc. Unterstützung, however, will come by
no means from the Intelligenz und fortschrittliche
Grundbesitzer[7]

alone, but also from many others, both from Semites and from
fortschrittliche Kaufleute und
Industrielle[8]

(the author has quite wrongly passed them over: it is still a question
whether they constitute a smaller percentage in their milieu than in that
of the
Grundbesitzer[9]

and those
Bauern[10]

who tend to represent Urteil and not Vorurteil,
Zukunft and not
Vergangenheit[11]

of their class, and very many others. In two respects the author has tipped
the scales in the other direction: firstly, in combating the Economists he
has left aside praktische, immediate
Forderungen,[12]

which are important not only for industriellen Arbeiter, but also
for Hausindustrielle and
Landarbeiter,[13]

etc. Secondly, he has fought against an abstract,

    

neglectful attitude to gemässigten
fortschrittlichen[14]

elements (it is fair to say that they should by no means be entirely
neglected, they should be utilised) and thereby, as it were, obscured the
independent and more resolute position adopted by the Bewegung he
represents. In the historico-philosophical sense the proposition which he
advances (and which was earlier advanced by Inorodzew in Soziale
Praxis[20]) is indisputable, viz., that among our present
Genossen[15]

there are no few verkleideten
Liberalen.[16]

To a certain extent this can also be said of Deutschland versus
England. That is, so to speak, our good fortune; it enables us to
count on an easier and swifter beginning; it compels us to utilise all
these verkleideten. But the author’s formulation can, perhaps,
give rise to some misinterpretation (one Old-Believer told me: but this is
belittling and depersonalising\dots), on the one hand, and a certain
feeling of distrust and embarrassment among Genossen. In this
respect Inorodzew’s formulation, too, in my opinion, was unfortunate.


As regards the heart of the matter, however, I think there are no
differences of opinion with the author. About Parvus, I haven’t the
slightest notion of his personal character and do not at all deny
his great talent. Unfortunately, I have read very few of his works.


Do you expect to obtain Kautsky’s Die
Agrarfrage,[17]

which has recently come out?


Regarding Wert, Yevg. Solovyov and M. Filippov, I must say that the
first-named I do not know at all, and I have read very little of the
other two. That there is and will be “weathering”, I have not an iota
of doubt. Hence it is especially necessary to have not only
verkleidete
Literatur.[18]
All the best  V. U.

April 27, 1899


I was very glad, A. N., to receive your letter of March 27, which
at last broke your long and persistent silence. A heap of questions to be
discussed has indeed accumulated but there is no opportunity of having any
detailed conversation here on subjects that are mainly of a literary nature. And
now there is the
journal[11]: without talks with one’s colleagues one feels too cut off for
writing. There is only Julius, who takes all this quite closely and
actively to heart, but the accursed “long distances” prevent
sufficiently detailed conversation with him.


I shall begin with what interests and agitates me now most of all—Bulgakov’s
article in issues 1–2 and 3 of Nachalo. On reading your opinion of
him, I was exceedingly pleased to meet with sympathy on the most essential
point—the more so because, apparently, one cannot count very much on sympathy
from the editorial board./dots If Bulgakov’s article made a “repellent” and
“pitiful” impression on you, it absolutely infuriated me. Up till now, though
I have read and re-read Bulgakov, I simply cannot understand how he could write
an article so completely nonsensical and in such an extremely unbecoming tone,
and how the editors found it possible not to dissociate themselves by at least a
single comment from such a slashing attack on Kautsky, Like you, I am
“convinced that our people are utterly [just so!] confused and puzzled”. And
who wouldn’t be puzzled when told—in the name of “modern science” (No. 3,
p. 34)—that Kautsky is all wrong, arbitrary, socially incredible, “with
equally little of both real agronomics and real economics” (No. 1–2) and so
forth? Moreover, Kautsky

    

is not expounded, but simply distorted, while Bulgakov’s own views as
part of any coherent system are entirely lacking. No man with any sense of party
spirit or sense of responsibility to all the Genossen and their whole
programme and practical activity would dare to take such “side kicks” (to use
your apt expression) at Kautsky, without giving anything himself, but merely
promising \dots a learned work on “Ost-Elbe”!  Apparently, he feels himself
free from all comradely obligations and responsibility, a “free” and
individual spokesman of professorial science, I do not forget, of course, that
under Russian conditions it is impossible to demand of a journal that it admit
some Genossen and exclude others—but a journal like Nachalo
is not an almanac, allowing Marxism just because it is the mode (à la
Mir Bozhy[12],
Nauchnoye Obozreniye[13],
etc.), but an organ of a definite trend. It is incumbent on such a journal,
therefore, to put a certain restraint on learned “kickers” and on all
“outsiderg” in general. It is to the fact that its editors have run it as an
organ of a definite trend and not as an almanac that
Novoye Slovo[14] owes its great success.


I read through Kautsky’s book before Bulgakov’s article appeared and I did not
find in the latter a single at all intelligent arguement against
Kautsky. What I did find was a heap of distortions of Kautsky’s ideas
and theses. What shear nonsense Bulgakov talks when he asserts, for example,
that Kautsky confuses technics and economics, that he tries to prove the “ruin
of agriculture” (No. 3, p. 31. Kautsky says just the opposite: . 289),
that he denies agriculture any tendency to develop (No. 3, p. 34), and so on!


I have already written, and sent to the editorial board a fortnight ago, a first
article on “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr. Bulgakov’s
Article)” and am now starting on a second dealing with the end of Bulgakov’s
article.[1]

I greatly fear that P.B. will reject it, either on account of its considerable
length (it turns out to be larger than Bulgakov’s article, firstly, because I
have to give reasons for refuting such unsupported and carelessly pronounced
verdicts as, for example, that Marx was wrong in teaching that the ratio
\fracv/c decreases in agriculture; secondly, because

    

it is essential to expound Kautsky), or because a polemic is considered
undesirable (of course, I have not used in the article a single abusive
expression, like those above, and in general I have tried to avoid anything
personal against Bulgakov. The tone in general is in no way sharper than in my
article against
Tugan-Baranovsky[15] on the theory of the market

). I
should be very glad to hear your opinion, when you have read Kautsky’s
book and finished reading Bulgakov: what exactly do you find “true”
in Bulgakov? And do you think it possible to let Bulgakov’s article in the
journal go unanswered?


In general, all this “new critical trend” in Marxism, espoused by
Struve and Bulgakov (P. B. is apparently in favour of Bulgakov), looks
highly suspicious to me: resounding phrases about “criticism”
against “dogma” and so forth—and absolutely no positive
results of the criticism. Moreover, compiling an article
à la Bulgakov required, besides “criticism” and
sympathy for professorial “modern science
tactlessness nec plus ultra.


I sent Struve a reply to his article on the
market.[2]

My
sister[16] writes to me that this reply will be published in Nauchnoye
Obozreniye and that P. B. intends to answer it in the same journal. I
cannot agree with you that “the crux of the question lies in the concrete
impossibility of an abstractly conceivable proposition” and my main
argument against P. B. is precisely that he mixes up abstract-theoretical and
concrete-historical questions. “Concretely impossible” is not only
realisation as put forward by Marx, but also land rent as put forward by him,
and average profit, and the equality between wages and the value of labour-
power, and much more besides. But the impossibility of something being realised
in a pure form is not a refutation. I am quite unable to see any
contradiction between my assertions in the
Studies[17] and in
Nauchnoye Obozreniye, nor do I see the “bourgeois
apologetics” with which Struve has been trying to frighten readers. What I
find most objec-

    

tionable in his article is the fact that he drags in critical philosophy and
that he makes remarks such as that Marx’s theory of value and profit
“indisputably suffers from a contradiction”. P. B. is
perfectly well aware that this is disputable—why then sow
confusion in the minds of our people, who so far have received no
systematic proof of this contradiction and its correction from any single
spokesman of the “new critical trend”?


And Bulgakov’s sally (No. 3, p. 34, note) against the theory of
Zusammenbruch[3]

!—without any mention of Bernstein and with the
irrevocable authority of a “learned” decree! I know about the
publication of Bernstein’s new book and I have ordered it but it is hardly
likely to be sent. The article about it in the Frankfurter
Zeitung[18] and in
Zhizn[19] (not a bad journal!
Its literary section is really good, even better than any others!) has quite
convinced me that I did not rightly understand Bernstein’s disjointed
articles and that he has got himself so tangled up in lies that he really
deserves to be
begraben,[4]

as the author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des
Materialismus[5]

expressed it in an open letter to
Kautsky. Bernstein’s arguments, which are new to me, against the
materialist conception of
history,[6]

etc., are (according to Zhizn)
astonishingly feeble. If P. B. is such an ardent defender of Bernstein that he
is all but prepared to “quarrel” over him, it is very, very sad,
because his “theory” against
Zusammenbruch—excessively narrow for Western Europe—is
altogether unsuitable and dangerous for Russia. Do you know that it is
already being made use of by our “young” people (ultra-Economists),
who in one publication gave an account of the Stuttgart debates in such a
way that for them Bernstein, Peus, and others were defenders of
“economics, not politics”? What does P. B.

    

think of such “allies”? If by the successes of the ultra-Economists you
mean the resignation of Volgin and his closest comrades, I know about
it[20];
it was a great shock to me and I am now puzzled as to how matters stand
and what the future has in store. I think it terribly harmful that this dispute
with the ultra-Economists was not fully and completely ventilated in
the press: it would have been the only serious way of clearing things up and
establishing certain precise theoretical propositions. Instead, there is now complete chaos!


My book has come
out[7]

and I have asked that it should be sent to you (I have not
yet received it myself). I have heard that the P.S. to the preface was late,
came under the preliminary censorship and, it seems, “got into
trouble”. I shall await your comments with interest.


I ordered Karelin’s book and read it before I received it from you. I
liked it very much; it is devilishly annoying that it was pared down!
Aren’t you going to write a review of it?


An acquaintance of mine has sent me A. P.’s “Magazine
Notes” (on the “heritage” and the “inheritors”). I
wonder whether the continuation intended to carry on a further polemic with me
or not? I liked A. P.’s article very much; the issue was much the
worse for the cuts in the article. Truth to tell, I see no differences of
opinion between us: you deal with a different question—not what the attitude of the
disciples is to Russian democracy in general and whether they reject it (I
wrote exclusively about
this),[8]

but what the relations were between
democrats of various types in the good old days. I was concerned only with
Mikhailovsky’s[21] mistake in supposing that we reject democracy
altogether—whereas you fasten on his other mistake, the
“slurring over” of substantially important distinctions in the
“heritage”. I saw Maslov’s note in No. 3 of Nauchnoye
Obozreniye directed against me, but to tell you the truth I was not
interested in it. By the way, the cuts in A. P.’s article confirmed my opinion
that it is “inconvenient” to

    

take a more striking testator than Skaldin (a sad confirmation!). In general, I
find the tone of the journal that of a dying body. If that is so, the end and
death is only a question of time. It is simply speculation on
Ratlosigkeit[9]

and bureaucracy in the department which, etc. One could
hold one’s tongue without any harm and not without advantage to the
cause. As a matter of fact, compared with the modern tone, our Materials
could be a model of “moderation” and
“solidity”[22]


All the best.


V. U.


Write more often, if it’s not too much bother, otherwise I am quite unable
to get press news from anyone.


I am sending the Historische
Berechtigung[10]

by registered
post. Please don’t think me careless about returning books:
you did not mention any time limit and so I did not refuse comrades who
 asked to he allowed to read it. I shall be very grateful for the end of
 Karelin.


Do you have any German reviews of Kautsky? I have read only that in the
Frankfurter Zeitung—irate and empty à la
Bulgakov.


I am very pleased on the whole with the issues of the
journal.[23]
It is splendidly, edited. Have you read Gvozdyov’s
book[24]
and what do you think of it?

(see Note 58). It had its own press where it printed revolutionary
literature and published the non-periodic miscellany
Rabotnik. At first the Emancipation of Labour group
controlled the Union and edited its publications. Eventually control
passed to the opportunist elements—the Economists or the
so-called “young” group. At the First Conference of the
Union held in November 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group announced
their refusal to edit the Union publications. The Group finally broke
with the Union and left its ranks in April 1900 at the Second
Conference of the Union, when the Emancipation of Labour group and its
supporters walked out and established their own
Sotsial-Demokrat organisation.


At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. held in 1903 the
Union’s representatives took an extremely opportunist stand and
walked out after the Congress declared the League of Russian
Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad to be the only organisation of
the Party abroad. The Second Congress declared the Union
dissolved. p. 36

June 27, 1899


Last Friday, the 18th, I received your letter of June 2, but I have not
received either Mehring or Karelin, about which you write. I waited a
little at first, thinking there was a delay in the post, but now I am forced to
believe that either the parcel has been lost or you put off sending
it. If the former is the case, lodge a complaint at once.


Your comments on my
book[1]

gave me great joy. All the same, I think you are
exaggerating in speaking about a translation of it: I doubt whether the Germans
would want to read a thing so crammed with facts of purely local and minor
significance. True, they translated
N.—on[8] (but then he already had
a great reputation and the recommendation, probably, of Engels, although the
latter had intended to make hay of it, according to Monist). Have you come
across reviews of it in the German literature? If I am not mistaken, they have
translated him into French too. I was somewhat surprised at your statement that
you “at last succeeded in obtaining” my book.... Didn’t you
receive it from Moscow or St. Petersburg? I asked that it should be sent to you,
as to all the rest of my friends, and they all got it. If you have not received
it, let me know and I shall write again to Moscow. So far I have not seen any
reviews of it in the press, but I don’t expect to find any before the
autumn—but then the only newspaper I read is Russkiye
Vedomosti,[9] which continues to maintain a “tactful
silence”....

 

I have read Bulgakov’s article in Archly. I do
not in tend to write a reply to him for the German public too:
for one thing, I couldn’t do it in German; secondly—and this is the
chief thing, for it would be possible, perhaps, to find a translator from
Russian—an article of the kind that I wrote for the Russian public, i.e.,
with a detailed exposition of Kautsky’s book, would be quite unsuitable
for the German public. I cannot answer Bulgakov’s special references (from
German statistical data) for I have no material. Nor would I undertake to write
for the Germans about his general standpoint (Kantian and
... Bernsteinian, if one can use the term). I think it really is necessary to
correct the Germans’ idea of the Russian disciples, but for this (unless someone
would undertake to write a special article) a simple paragraph about my article
against Bulgakov, when this article is published in a Russian journal,
would
suffice.[2]

But if it is not published at all—owing to the demise of
Nachalo and the refusal of Zhizn, or the censorship—then the matter will take quite a different turn.


Regarding the “sensational discoveries” of the Russian disciples and
their neo-Kantianism, I am becoming more and more indignant. I have read
Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in No. 5 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye....
What utterly stupid and pretentious nonsense! Without any historical study of
Marx’s doctrine, without any new researches, on the basis of schematic
errors (arbitrary alteration of the norm of surplus-value), on the basis of
elevating to a general rule an exceptional case (raising the productivity of
labour without decreasing the value of the product: an absurdity if
this is taken as a general phenomenon)—on the basis of this to talk
about a “new theory”, about Marx’s mistake, about reconstruction.... No, I cannot believe your statement that Tugan Baranovsky is becoming
more and more a Genosse. Mikhailovsky was right in calling him an
“echo man”: his article in Mir Bozhy (“according to
Beltov”, you remember? in

    

1895) and this article confirm the severe judgement of the
prejudiced critic. It is confirmed also by what I have heard
about his personal qualities from you and from Nadya. Of
course, all this is not enough to draw a final conclusion,
and I am quite likely to be mistaken. It would be interesting
to know your opinion of his article.

And then there’s this idea of distinguishing between
“sociological” and “economic” categories, set going by
Struve (in No. 1 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye) and repeated
both by P. Berlin (in Zhizn) and by Tugan-Baranovsky.
In my view it promises nothing but an utterly meaningless
and scholastic play at definitions, to which the Kantians
give the resounding name of “critique of concepts” or
even “gnosiology”. I simply cannot understand what sense
there is in such a distinction. How can there be something
economic apart from social?

Incidentally, concerning neo-Kantianism. What stand
do you take? I have read and re-read with great pleasure
Beiträge zur Geschichte des Materialismus, I have read the
articles of the same author in Neue Zeit against Bernstein
and Conrad Schmidt (Neue Zeit, No. 5, 1898–99; the later
issues I have not
seen),[10] I have read Stammler
“(Wirtschaft und
Recht)”[3]

whom our Kantians (P. Struve and
Bulgakov) have so highly praised, and I definitely side with
Monist. Stammler especially rouses my indignation; I fail
to see in him even a hint of anything fresh and significant....
Sheer erkenntnistheoretische
Scholastik[4]

!

Stupid
“definitions” of a mediocre lawyer, in the worst sense of this last
word, and no less stupid “conclusions” drawn from them.
After Stammler, I re-read the articles of Struve and
Bulgakov in Novoye Slovo and found that neo-Kantianism was a
thing to be seriously reckoned with. I could no longer
restrain myself and stuck in my comments and attacks against
it, both in reply to Struve (on his article in Nauchnoye
Obozreniye.[5]

Why and by whom the publication of this reply
is being held up—I fail to understand. It was to have

    

appeared in No. 6 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye. But it is not there.
Meanwhile, my silence is beginning to make things awkward
for me: for example, Nezhdanov’s article in Zhizn
No. 4 [11])
and in reply to Bulgakov. I say, “I could no longer
restrain myself” for I am only too well aware of my lack of
philosophical education and I do not intend to write on these
subjects until I have learned more. That is just what I am
now doing—I have started with Holbach and Helvètius,
and am now taking up Kant. I have got hold of the chief
works of the chief classical philosophers, but I do not have
the neo-Kantian books (I have only ordered Lange). Tell
me, please, whether you or your comrades have them and
whether you could not share them with me.

On the same subject I have been greatly interested by
the review in No. 5 of Nachalo (May issue, which is in
the last stages of consumption) on Bogdanov’s book. I
don’t understand how I could have missed the notice of
this book’s publication. I have only now ordered it.
Already from Bogdanov’s first book I suspected Monist, and
the title and contents of the second book strengthen my
suspicions. And how disgustingly pointless and
disgustingly supercilious this review is! Not a word on the real
issue and ... a reprimand for ignoring Kantianism, although
it is evident from the reviewer’s own words that Bogdanov
does not ignore Kantianism,
but refutes it, having a different
standpoint in philosophy.... I think (if I am not mistaken,
about Bogdanov) it is impossible to let this review go
unanswered.[12] The only thing I can’t understand is how
Kamensky could have left unanswered the articles of Struve
and Bulgakov in Novoye Slovo against Engels! Could you
explain this for me?

Your information about the reaction against Marxism
which has begun in St. Petersburg was news to me. I am
puzzled. “Reaction”—does that mean among the Marxists?
And which ones? P. B. again? Is it he and his Co. who are
developing a tendency to unite with the liberals? I am
looking forward to your explanations with great impatience.
I fully agree that the “critics” are only confusing our people,
while giving absolutely nothing, and that a serious fight with
them (especially over Bernstein) will be necessary (only
will there be somewhere to fight...?). If P. B. “absolutely

    

ceases to be a Genosse”—so much the worse for him. It will
be a great loss, of course, for all Genossen, for he is very
talented and knowledgeable, but, of course, “friendship is
friendship, but service is service”, and this does not do
away with the need to fight. I fully understand and share
your “fury” (caused by the epithet “loathsome” [sic!] in
regard to Monist—because of what? because of the article
in Neue Zeit? because of the open letter to Kautsky about
who will begraben whom?) and I am eager to know about
his answer to your letter giving vent to this fury. (I have
not yet seen Bernstein’s book).  Gründliche
Auseinandersetzung is necessary, of course, but it will not and cannot
appear in Nachalo or Zhizn: only specific articles against the
“critics” of Marxism will be published. What is required
for it is a third kind of
literature[6]

and Platform (if I
have understood you rightly). Only then, at last, the Genossen
will be dissociated from “outsiders” and “kickers”, and
only then will no kind of personal whimsies or theoretical
“sensational discoveries” be able to produce confusion and
anarchy. The accursed Russian disorganisation is wholly
to blame here!

It is not clear to me in what way your article on the
heritage (I have read only the first one) was aimed at the St.
Petersburgers, I have not seen the article “Out of Turn”.
Send it to me.

I should very much like to have a more detailed and
circumstantial talk about the
Blitzableiter.[7]

But this,
evidently, will have to be left for another time. My term of
exile ends on January 29, 1900. I hope they don’t extend
it—a calamity that not infrequently strikes exiles in Eastern
Siberia. I am dreaming of Pskov. And you?

Nadya sends her regards.

All the very best.


V. U.

P.S. I have just re-read the end of my article against
Bulgakov in the rough copy ... and I have noticed that my
tone there is conciliatory; implying, as it were: I am an

    

“orthodox” and vigorous opponent of the “critics” (that I
said plainly), but we must not exaggerate these
disagreements [as Mr. Bulgakov does] in the face of common
enemies. It is quite possible that this “conciliatory” tone [I
have tried my hardest to be mild and polemise as a Genosse]
will prove inappropriate or even ridiculous if expressions
like “loathsome” are employed, and if the “critics” cause
a definitive cleavage. In that case I should find myself
“guilty though guiltless”; not having seen Bernstein’s book,
not knowing all the views of the “critics”, and being at a
“respectable distance”, my view [when I wrote that article]
Was quite an “old one”, simply that of a contributor to
Nachalo.... It looks as if my statement about the theory
of the class struggle not having been touched on by the
“critics” is
incorrect?[13]

(N.—on)—Danielson, Nikolai Frantsevich
(1844-1918)—Russian writer and economist, an ideologue of
liberal Narodism of the eighties and nineties; in his political
activities he reflected the evolution of the Narodniks away from
revolutionary action against tsarism towards a conciliatory attitude
to it. Completed the translation of Marx’s Capital into
Russian, which was begun by G. A. Lopatin. While working on this
translation he carried on a correspondence with Marx and Engels in
which he touched on the problems of Russia’s economic
development. Danielson, however, failed to grasp the essence of
Marxism and subsequently came out against it.


Lenin here refers to Danielson’s book Sketches of Our
Post-Reform Social Economy in which its author elaborates
Narodnik views on the development of post-reform national economy in
Russia. The German edition appeared in 1899 in Munich. The French
edition was published in 1902. p. 38




[9]
Russkiye Vedomosti (Russian Recorder)—a newspaper
published in Moscow from 1863 onwards; it expressed the views of the
moderate liberal intelligentsia. In 1905 it became the organ of the
Right wing of the bourgeois Cadet Party. It was closed down In 1918
together with other counter-revolutionary newspapers. p. 38




[10]
Lenin refers to Plekhanov’s article “Konrad Schmidt gegen
Karl Marx und Friedrich Engels” published in Die Neue
Zeit No. 5 for 1898-99. p. 40




[11]
Nezhdanov’s article mentioned here is entitled “Markets
under Capitalist Production (Apropos of Ratner’s, Ilyin’s
and Struve’s Articles)”. Lenin replied to this in his
article “Reply to Mr. P. Nezhdanov” (see Vol. 4 of this
edition). p. 41




[12]
This refers to the review of A. Bogdanov’s book Fundamentals
of the Historic View on Nature, which came out in St. Petersburg
in 1899. The first book by the same author A Short Course of
Economic Science was reviewed by Lenin in Mir Bozhy
No. 4 for April 1898 (see Vol. 4 of this edition, pp. 46-54).


Bogdanov, A. (Malinovsky, Alexander Alexandrovich)
(1873-1928)—philosopher, sociologist and economist, by education
a physician. During the nineties took part in the work of the
Social-Democratic circles. After the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. (1903) joined the Bolsheviks. During the years of reaction
(1907-10) he became the leader of the otzovists and of the Vperyod
group, which came out against Lenin and the Party. In questions of
philosophy he attempted to set up a system of his own, known as
“empirio-monism”, a species of subjective-idealist Machian
philosophy, which was sharply criticised by Lenin in his book
Materialism and Empirio-criticism (1909) (see Vol. 14 of this
edition). p. 41




[13]
The remarks referring to the end of Lenin’s article
“Capitalism in Agriculture” were taken into consideration
by Lenin when publishing the article (see Vol. 4 of this
edition). p. 43

I have long been intending to write to you about affairs,
but various circumstances have always interfered. My life
here is all bustle, even painfully so—and this (N.B.) despite
the extraordinary precautions taken against it! I live
almost, one might say, in solitude—and yet there is this
bustle. But then I suppose it’s unavoidable in every new
situation, and it would be a sin to complain, seeing that
I am not half as nervy as our dear
bookseller[2] who succumbs
to black melancholy and momentary prostration under the
influence of this bustle. But there is much that is good
besides the bustle. Well, I shall now tell you something about
the affairs of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
Abroad, and I shall do so on the basis of facts and accounts
of the other side....

In the first place, a completely wrong idea of Vademecum
prevails in Russia as a result of the cock-and-bull stories
of the Rabocheye Dyelo supporters. To hear them—it is
nothing but indulgence in personalities, and so forth,
nothing but acting general and making mountains out of
molehills for the sake of denigrating individuals, nothing
but the use of “impermissible” methods, etc. Actually, this
thing is a major issue of principle, and the attacks on
individuals are merely an appendage, an appendage that
is inevitable in view of the confused relations which the
“young” have tried to create and aggravate to the utmost.
Vademecum is an outcry, a forthright outcry against
banal Economism, against the “shame and disgrace” of
Social-Democracy. “I never thought I would have to
experience such shame,” exclaims Plekhanov at the end
of the preface to the documents he has published. “We

    

must get out of this chaotic and disgraceful situation
at all costs. Woe to the party that patiently tolerates such
confusion!” And against all the various accusations levelled
at Plekhanov we must first of all categorically establish
that the whole essence of his pamphlet is precisely a
declaration of war against the “disgraceful” principles of
“Credoism” and “Kuskova-ism”, precisely a split over principles,
and the split and “fracas” in the Union are merely a side
effect of this dissension over principles.

If the split over principles has been combined with this
“fracas” (at the Congress of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad in April 1900, things literally came to
the pitch of brawling, hysteria, and so on and so forth,
which led to Plekhanov’s resignation), if things took this
turn, the blame for it rests with the young. It was from the
standpoint of Economism that the young waged a
systematic, stubborn and dishonest struggle against the
Emancipation of Labour group during 1898—“dishonest” because
they did not show their colours openly, because they
baselessly put all the blame on “Russia” (keeping silent about
the anti-“Economist” Social-Democrats of Russia), and
because they have used their connections and practical resources
to push aside the Emancipation of Labour group in order
to declare the latter’s unwillingness to let in “disgraceful”
ideas and disgraceful stupidity to be an unwillingness to let
in all “young forces” in general. This struggle against the
Emancipation of Labour group, this pushing it aside, was
carried out on the sly, in a “private” fashion, by means
of “private” correspondence and “private” conversations—plainly
and bluntly speaking, by means of intrigue,
because the role of the Emancipation of Labour group in the
Russian Social-Democratic movement never was, never will
be and never can be a private matter. The young proclaimed
“new” views against the old, but concealed those views
so artfully and diplomatically (thereby showing that for
them the very question of views was a private matter) that
it was left for the old to set forth the gist of the disputes.
“We sent to St. Petersburg an account of our disputes with
the young ones” writes Plekhanov (p. XLVII of Vademecum
Thus, as early as 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group
proved that for it the whole question lay in the vacillation

    

over principles on the part of the young, who were capable
of sinking as low as complete denial of socialism. As early
as 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group came out with
an appeal to Russian Social-Democrats against ideological
waverings,[3] but this appeal proved to be the voice in the
wilderness, since after the arrests in the summer of 1898
all outstanding leaders of the Party were swept from the
battlefield and only the voice of the Economists responded
to the appeal.

It is not surprising that after this the Emancipation of
Labour group resigned from the editorial board, it is not
surprising that open war against Economism became more
and more urgent and inevitable. But here, to the aid of the
Economic trend, came people who were united to these
Economists by long-standing hostility towards the
Emancipation of Labour group and these people did not shrink
from the attempt to abet Economism, without washing
dirty linen in public, and to enable the Economists to
continue, with greater convenience than ever before, the tactics
of “private” propaganda of their views under the flag of
Social-Democracy and under cover of ambiguous statements
by the new editorial board, which wanted to imitate that
dear little calf who sucked two mothers at once.

In the very first issue of Rabocheye Dyelo the new editors
declared that they “do not know what young comrades
P. B. Axelrod is talking about” in attacking the
Economists. They declared this despite the fact that the whole
history of the Union in recent years was a history of its
struggle with the “young”; they declared this despite the
fact that one of the members of the editorial board of
Rabocheye Dyelo was himself an adherent of the Economic trend
(Mr. V. I—n).[4] To an outsider, to one who has not
pondered over the history of Russian Social-Democracy and
the Social-Democratic Union Abroad during the last few
years, it may seem quite incomprehensible and strange
that such a slight and (apparently) casual remark dropped
by the editors of Rabocheye Dyelo “(we do not know what
young comrades P. B. Axelrod is talking about”) could
spark off the most passionate polemics, ending in the split
of the Union and its disintegration. Yet there is nothing
strange about this seemingly strange phenomenon. The

    

slight remark of Rabocheye Dyelo’s editors in connection
with their publication of Mr. V. I—n’s articles fully and
clearly revealed the cardinal distinction between two
conceptions of the immediate tasks and most urgent demands of
Russian Social-Democracy. The first conception can be
expressed in the words laissez faire, laissez passer in relation to
Economism. These are tactics of a conciliatory attitude
to Economism, the tactics of concealing the “extremes” of
Economism, of defending Economism against open struggle
against it, the tactics of “free criticism”, i.e., free
criticism of Marxism on the part of all overt and covert
ideologists of the bourgeoisie. The other conception required
a resolute struggle against Economism, an open protest
against the threatening vulgarisation and narrowing of
Marxism, an irrevocable break with bourgeois “criticism”.

September 5, 1900
Nuremberg


Comrade,

It looks as if we shall not be able to meet—we are not
going to either Mainz or Paris and leave here
tomorrow.[2]
It is a, great pity, but we must accept the situation and
confine ourselves to conversing by post.

Firstly, I hasten to correct a remark in your first letter,
a correction I would ask you to convey also to the person
who told you of my “promise to meet”. That is not true.
I did not promise to meet, but said that we would officially
(i.e., on behalf of our
group[3]) get in touch with the
Union[4]   when we
were abroad, if this appeared to be necessary. It was   wrong of
G.[5] to forget about this condition, and to forget
besides to tell you that I spoke with him in a personal
capacity and, consequently, could not have promised
anything definite in anticipation of our group’s decision. When
we heard out the other side
here[6] and  learned about the
congress and the split, we saw that there was now no need
for an official contact. That’s all. Consequently, the Union
has no right whatever to “lay claim” to me, whereas I claim
that G. told certain other persons of our conversation,
although he had formally promised me that, prior to our
group making contact with the Union, he would inform no
one except the arrested person. Since you have informed me
of his claim, I hope you will not refuse, being in Paris, to
inform him likewise of this claim of mine. If “the rumour
is heavy on the
ground”,[7] it is G. who is to blame for
it.[1]

 

Now passing to the heart of the matter. Amalgamation
is impossible. So is federation, if the word is understood in
its real sense, i.e., a certain agreement, a treaty, mutual
obligations, etc. “The endeavour to afford each other as much
help as possible”—is, I think, not bound up with federation,
but is possible also without it, and is possible in general,
although I do not know whether it is easily practicable. If the
Union sincerely desired this, it would hardly have started with
ultimatums and the threat of a boycott (that was precisely
the meaning of the words used by the person who delivered
your letter); that cannot serve to improve relations.

We are an independent literary group. We want to remain
independent. We do not consider it possible to carry on
without such forces as Plekhanov and the Emancipation
of Labour group, but no one is entitled to conclude from this
that we shall forego even a particle of our independence.
That is all we can say at the moment to people who want
to know above all what our attitude is to the Emancipation
of Labour group. To anyone who is not satisfied with this,
we have nothing to say except: judge us by our deeds if you
do not believe our words. If, however, it is a question not
of the present moment, but of the more or less near future,
then, of course, we shall not refuse to impart to people
with whom we shall have close relations more detailed
information on the form of the relations between us and the
Emancipation of Labour group.

You will ask: what kind of relations will you have with
the Union? For the time being none, because it is our
unalterable decision to remain an independent group and enjoy
the closest co-operation of the Emancipation of Labour
group. This decision, however, is distrusted by the Union,
which fears that we will not be capable of sustaining our
complete independence, that we will fall into an
“impossible” (your expression) polemical tone. If our activity
dispels this distrust on the part of the Union, good relations
can be established between us, otherwise they cannot. Voilà
tout. You write: “The Union is looking to you”; but
obviously we can only help the Union with writings, and it is no
less obvious that at the present time, when all our vital
juices must go to nourish our coming
offspring,[8] we cannot
afford to feed other people’s children.
 

You write that 1) there are no disagreements in principle,
and that 2) the Union is ready to prove in practice its
determination to fight the “Economic trend”. We are certain
that on both these points you are mistaken. Our conviction
is based on such writings as the postscript to the
Anti-Credo,[9]
the reply to
Vademecum,[10]
No. 6 of Rabocheye
Dyelo,[11] the
preface to the pamphlet A Turning Point in the Jewish
Labour Movement, and others. We intend to come out in
writing with a refutation of the opinion that there are no
disagreements in principle (so that we shall have some
relations with the Union: relations between parties engaged
in a polemic).

Now for the last and main point: are we right or not in
regarding you as having had “a very, very sharp change
of views”? Let us recall how things stood in Russia: you
knew that we wanted to found an independent literary
enterprise, you knew that we were for Plekhanov.
Consequently, you knew everything, and not only did not refuse to
participate, but, on the contrary, yourself used such an
expression as “our” enterprise (do you remember our last talk
in your flat en troits?), thus giving us grounds for expecting
the closest participation from you. Now, however, it turns
out that you are silent on the question of your participation,
that you set us the “task” of “settling the conflict abroad at
all costs”, that is to say, a task which we have not undertaken
and are not undertaking—without, of course, giving up
the hope that our foundation of an independent enterprise
with the co-operation of the Emancipation of Labour group
may create a basis for settling the conflict. Now, apparently,
you doubt the expediency of our group establishing an
independent enterprise, for you write that the existence of
two organisations with “each leaving the other to act as the
spirit moves it” will be bad for the cause. It seems
indubitable to us that your views have undergone a sharp change.
We have now set before you with complete frankness how
matters stand with us, and we should be very glad if our
exchange of views on the question of “impending tasks”
were not limited to this.

Address: Nürnberg, Ph.  Roegner.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Secondly, yet another little departure: I heard out both G.,
whom I met in the course of several days, and the other side. You,
on the other hand, heard out only the Unionists; but no more or less
influential and authoritative representatives of the other side. Hence
it seems to me that it is you, if anybody, who has violated the rule
of “audiatur et altera pars”

“(hear the other side as well”—Ed.)—Lenin
 



[2]
On September 6 Lenin left Nuremberg for Munich, which was chosen as
the residence for the members of the editorial board of the all-Russia
illegal Marxist newspaper Iskra. p. 48




[3]
This refers to the group consisting of V. I. Lenin, Y. O. Martov and
A. N. Potresov formed on Lenin’s initiative upon his return from
exile at the beginning of 1900 with the object of setting up abroad an
all-Russia illegal Marxist newspaper. p. 48




[4]
This refers to the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad (see Note
39). p. 48




[5]
Here and elsewhere the reference is to Lenin’s talks with
Ts. Kopolson (“Grishin”), a member of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad. p. 48




[6]
This refers to the Emancipation of Labour group, the first Russian
Marxist group, founded by Plekhanov in Geneva in 1883. Other members
of the group were P. B. Axelrod, L. G. Deutsch, V. I. Zasulich and
V. N. Ignatov. The E. L. group did a great deal to disseminate Marxism
in Russia. It translated into Russian, published abroad and
distributed in Russia the works of the founders of Marxism:
Manifesto of the Communist Party by Marx and Engels;
Wage-Labour and Capitalism by Marx; Socialism: Utopian
and Scientific by Engels and other works. Plekhanov and his group
dealt a severe blow to Narodism. The two drafts of a programme for
Russian Social-Democrats written by Plekhanov in 1883 and 1885 and
published by the E. L. group were an important step towards preparing
the ground for and establishing a Social-Democratic Party in
Russia. An important part in spreading Marxist views in Russia was
played by Plekhanov’s essays: Socialism and the Political
Struggle (1883), Our Differences (1885) and The
Development of the Monist View of History (1895). The
E. L. group, however, committed serious errors; they clung to remnants
of the Narodnik views, underestimated the revolutionary capacity of
the peasantry and overestimated the role of the liberal
bourgeoisie. These errors were the embryo of the future Menshevik
views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group.


Lenin pointed out that the E. L. group “only laid the
theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took
the first step towards the working-class movement” (see Vol. 20,
P. 278 of this edition).


At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in August 1903 the
E. L. group announced that it had ceased its activities as a
group. p. 48




[7]
The rumour refers to the forthcoming publication of the newspaper
Iskra.


Iskra (The Spark) was the first all-Russia illegal Marxist
newspaper; it was founded by Lenin in 1900 and played an important
role in building the Marxist revolutionary party of the working class
in Russia.



As it was impossible to publish a revolutionary newspaper in Russia on account
of police persecution, Lenin, while still in exile in Siberia, evolved a
detailed plan for its publication abroad. When his exile ended (in January 1900)
Lenin immediately set about putting his plan into effect.


The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra was published in Leipzig in
December 1900; later issues were published in Munich; from July 1902 the paper
was published in London, and from the spring of 1903 in Geneva. Considerable
help in getting the newspaper going (the organization of secret
printing-presses, the acquisition of Russian type, etc.) was rendered by the
German Social-Democrats Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun and others, as well as by
Julian Marchlewski, a Polish revolutionary residing at Munich at the time, and
by Harry Quelch, one of the leaders of the English Social-Democratic Federation.


The editorial board of Iskra consisted of V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov,
Y. O. Martov, P. B. Axelrod, A. N. Potresov and V. 1. Zasulich. The first
secretary of the board was I. G. Smidovich-Leman; in the spring of 1901 this
post was taken over by N. K. Krupskaya, who also conducted the correspondence
between Iskra and the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia. Lenin
was virtually Editor-in-Chief and the leading figure in Iskra, in which
he published his articles on all fundamental issues of Party organisation and
the class struggle of the proletariat in Russia, and dealt with the most
important international events.


Iskra became the centre for the unification of Party forces, for the
gathering and training of Party cadres. R.S.D.L.P. groups and committees of a
Leninist Iskra trend were set up in a number of Russian cities
(St. Petersburg, Moscow, Samara and others). Iskrist organisations sprang up and
worked under the direct leadership of Lenin’s disciples and associates
N. E. Bauman, I. V. Babushkin, S. I. Gusev, M. I. Kalinin, P. A. Krasikov,
G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, P. V. Lengnik, P. N. Lepeshinsky, I. I. Radchenko, and
others.


On the initiative and with the direct participation of Lenin the Iskra
editorial board drew up a draft programme of the Party (published in
Iskra No. 21), and prepared the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
which was held in July-August 1903. By the time the Congress was convened most
of the local Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had adopted the
Iskra position, approved its tactics, programme and plan of
organisation, and recognised the newspaper as their leading organ. A special
resolution of the Congress noted Iskra’s exceptional role in the
struggle to build the Party and adopted the newspaper as the Central Organ of
the R.S.D.L.P. The Second Congress approved an editorial board consisting of
Lenin, Plekhanov and Martov. Despite the Congress decision Martov refused to
participate, and issues Nos. 46-51 of Iskra were edited by Lenin and
Plekhanov. Later Plekhanov adopted a Menshevik stand and demanded that all the
old Menshevik editors be included in the editorial board of Iskra,
although they had been rejected by the Congress. Lenin could

   

not agree to this, and on October 19 (November 1), 1903, he resigned from the
Iskra editorial board. He was co-opted to the Central Committee, from
where he conducted a struggle against the Menshevik opportunists. Issue 52 was
edited by Plekhanov alone. On November 13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov, on his own
initiative and in defiance of the will of the Congress, co-opted all the old
Menshevik editors to the editorial board. Beginning with issue 52 the Mensheviks
turned Iskra into their own organ. p. 48

Meaning the newspaper Iskra. p. 49




[9]
In August 1899, upon receiving from A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova in St. Petersburg
the manifesto of the Economists which she called “the Credo of the
‘young’ group”, Lenin wrote his Anti-Credo—“A Protest
by Russian Social-Democrats” (see Vol. 4, pp. 167-82 of this edition). The
author of the Credowas Y. D. Kuskova, then a member of the Union of
Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. The manifesto of the Economists was not
intended for the press, and, as Lenin pointed out, was published “without
the consent and perhaps even against the will of its authors”, because the
Economists feared public criticism of their opportunist views (see Vol. 5,
p. 364 of this edition). p. 50




[10]
Vademecum for the Editors of Rabocheye Dyelo. A Collection of Material
Published by the Emancipation of Labour Group, with a Preface by G. V.
Plekhanov (Geneva, February 1900) was in the ranks of the R.S.D.L.P.,
chiefly against Economism of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and of
its organ the journal Rabocheye Dyelo. p. 50




[11]
Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause)—a journal, organ of the
Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, published in Geneva from April 1899 to
February 1902. Twelve numbers (nine books) were issued in all. The editorial
board of Rabocheye Dyelo was the centre of the Economists
abroad. Rabocheye Dyelo supported Bernstein’s slogan of
“freedom of criticism” of Marxism, and took an opportunist stand on
questions of the tactics and organisational tasks of the Russian
Social-Democrats. Its supporters propagated opportunist ideas making the
proletariat’s political struggle subservient to the economic struggle; they
exalted spontaneity in the working-class movement and denied the leading role of
the Party. V. P. Ivanshin, one of the journal’s; editors, also took part in
editing Rabochaya Mysl, organ of the outspoken Economists, which
Rabocheye Dyelo supported. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the
Rabocheya Dyelo group represented the extreme Right, opportunist wing
of the Party. p. 50

October 26


I received your letter of October 24 yesterday and am
replying at once as requested.

I cannot forward the letter just now, as I am not sending
any pasted-in things to the address I have, and only use
the chemical method. I have no time to copy the letter by
this means. I wrote to the
addressee[3] yesterday giving
the substance of the letter, and I hope in the near future to
communicate the whole letter to him. But if you can copy
it into an unbound book by the chemical method, then I
will send it at once.

I will give my sister the address: she was not in Paris
in September, so you could hardly have been there at the
same time. I hope you dropped her a few lines at the address
I gave you.

Now, to business.

Your letter to me creates a strange impression. Apart
from information concerning addresses and forwarding, it
contains nothing but reproaches—bare reproaches without
any explanations. You even go to the extent of attempting
caustic remarks “(are you sure that you have done this
for the benefit of the Russian workers’ movement and not
for the benefit of Plekhanov?”)—but, of course, I am not
going to exchange caustic remarks with you.

You reproach me for having “advised
against”.[4] You
quote me very inaccurately. I remember very well that I
did not express myself categorically, absolutely. I wrote:
“We find it hard at the moment to advise anything”; that
is to say, I made our decision depend directly on a
preliminary elucidation of the matter. What this elucidation

    

should have been, is clear from my letter: it was essential for
us to be  perfectly sure whether there had really been a “turn”
in Rabochaya
Mysl[5] (as we had been told and as we were
entitled to conclude from the fact that you proposed to
Plekhanov that he should participate) and what kind of
turn.

On this basic and main question you do not say a word.

That we regard Rabochaya Mysl as an organ of a special
trend with which we differ in the most serious way is
something of which you have long been aware. Some months
ago both the addressee of your long letter and I flatly
refused to take part in an organ of that trend, and obviously,
in doing so ourselves, we could not but advise others to
do the same.

The news of a “turn” in Rabochaya Mysl, however, put
us in a “difficulty”. A real turn could substantially alter
the situation. It is natural therefore that in my letter I
expressed above all the desire to learn all the details of the
turn—but you have not said a word in reply to this.

Perhaps, however, you consider that the answer to my
question about the turn is contained in your letter to my
friend[6]? Perhaps, if you approached Plekhanov on behalf
of the editorial board of Rabochaya Mysl, your letter to
my friend could be regarded as an authentic expression of
the board’s views? If so, then I am inclined to draw the
conclusion that there has been no turn. If I am mistaken,
please explain my mistake to me. The other day, another
close supporter of Plekhanov wrote to me about the turn
in Rabochaya Mysl. But, being in correspondence with
you, I cannot, of course, believe these “rumours” of a turn
which are not in any way confirmed by you.

Again, I had better say openly and straightaway (even
at the risk of incurring further reproaches) that, being in
complete solidarity with my friend (to whom you write),
I subscribe to his words: “We shall have to fight you”—if
there is no turn. But if there is—you must explain in full
detail exactly what this turn is.

You write to my friend: “fight us, if you are not ashamed
to do so”. He will answer you himself, of course, but I for
my part beg leave to reply to this. I am not in the least
ashamed to fight—seeing that things have gone so far that

    

the disagreements have concerned fundamental issues, that
an atmosphere has been created of mutual
non-comprehension, mutual distrust and complete discordance of views
(I am not speaking of Rabochaya Mysl alone; I am speaking
about everything I have seen and heard, and not so much
here as at home), inasmuch as a number of “splits” has already
arisen on this basis. To get rid of this oppressive
atmosphere, even a furious thunderstorm, and not merely a
literary polemic, can (and should) be welcomed.

And there is no reason to be so much afraid of a struggle:
a struggle may cause annoyance to some individuals, but
it will clear the air, define attitudes in a precise and
straightforward manner, define which differences are important and
which unimportant, define where people stand—those who
are taking a completely different path and those Party
comrades who differ only on minor points.

You write that there have been mistakes in Rabochaya
Mysl. Of course, we all make mistakes. Without a
struggle, however, how is one to distinguish these minor mistakes
from the trend which stands clearly revealed in Rabochaya
Mysl and attains its culmination in the
“Credo”.[1]

Without
struggle there cannot be a sorting out, and without a sorting
out there cannot be any successful advance, nor can there
be any lasting unity. And those who are beginning the
struggle at the present time are by no means destroying
    

unity. There is no longer any unity, it has already been
destroyed all along the line. Russian Marxism and Russian
Social-Democracy are already a house divided against
itself, and an open, frank struggle is one of the essential
conditions for restoring unity.

Yes, restoring! The kind of “unity” that makes us
conceal “Economic” documents from our comrades like a secret
disease, that makes us resent the publication of statements
revealing what views are being propagated under the guise
of Social-Democratic views—such “unity” is not worth a
brass farthing, such “unity” is sheer cant, it only aggravates
the disease and makes it assume a chronic, malignant form.
That an open, frank and honest struggle will cure this
disease and create a really united, vigorous and strong
Social-Democratic movement—I do not for a moment doubt.

Perhaps it is very inappropriate that in a letter to you
of all people I have to speak so often of a struggle (literary
struggle). But I think that our old friendship most of all
makes complete frankness obligatory.

All the best.


Petroff

P.S. In a week or two I shall have another address: Herr
Philipp Roegner, Cigarrenhandlung, Neue Gasse, Nürnberg
(only for letters and in two envelopes). [Please do not
write any initials in the letters—heaven knows whether
the post here is quite reliable.]

 
Notes
 

[1]
Note. In your letter to my friend, for example, there is both
misunderstanding and the Economic trend. You are right in stressing
that an economic struggle is necessary, that one must know how to
make use of legal societies, that all kinds of responses and so forth
are necessary, that one should not turn one’s back on society. All
that is legitimate and true. And if you think that revolutionaries have
a different view, that is a misunderstanding. Revolutionaries say
merely that every effort must be made to ensure that legal societies
and so forth do not separate the workers’ movement from
Social-Democracy and the revolutionary political struggle but, on the
contrary, unite them as closely and indissolubly as possible. In your
letter, however, there is no effort to combine, but there is an effort
to separate, that is, there is Economism or
“Bernsteinism”,[7] for
example, in the statement: “The labour question in Russia, as it
stands in reality, was first raised by Rabochaya Mysl”—in its
arguments about the judicial struggle and so forth.


I apologise if my reference to your letter to my friend offends
you; I wanted only to illustrate my thought.—Lenin

into a petty-bourgeois party of social reform. In Russia this trend found
support among the “legal Marxists” and the Economists. p. 53

January 30, 1901

I have received your letter just now, dear G. V.,
immediately on my return from a “final” talk with
Judas.[5]
The matter has been settled and I am terribly displeased
with the way in which it has been settled. I hasten to write
to you while my impressions are still fresh.

Judas did not argue about the “democratic opposition”;                       he is no romantic and not one to be frightened with words.                     But, as far as “item 7” is concerned (the utilisation of
material for Iskra, material reaching Sovremennoye Obozreniye
),he outsmarted our people, all of whom, P.B. y compris
,stood up for him, against me. He, Judas—you see—expected
that Iskra would be more popular, more “working-class”;
he finds that our free use of material received by
Sovremennoye Obozreniye could create competition.... He demands
that material for Iskra should be used only by agreement
with the representative of Sovremennoye
Obozreniye—agreement ceases to be necessary only if it is impossible to
communicate with this representative, a condition that,
obviously, will rarely operate, for Judas says frankly that
he proposes either the existence of a representative im
Auslande[1]

“(not more than 12 hours from Munich”) or
very punctual correspondence. He would like to publish
each month five sheets—that is to say, about 200,000
characters—just as much as in two sheets of Iskra. That he
will be able to supply so much material is hardly to be
doubted, for he is well-to-do, writes a great deal and has
good connections. The thing is clear: the competition is

    

aimed not so much against
Zarya[6] as against Iskra; the
same preponderance of political material, the same
newspaper character—review of current events, short articles
(Judas with very true intuition attaches very great
importance to the frequent publication of booklets with smallish
articles). We shall be swamped with material of this kind.
we shall be running around carrying out errands for Judas,
who by his control of Sovremennoye Obozreniye (it is obvious
that he will be master and complete master there for he has
the money and 99 per cent of the materials—it is rarely,
if ever, that we shall be in a position to give them even
a very little) will make a magnificent liberal career and
try to shoulder aside not only the heavyish Zarya, but Iskra
as well. We shall be running around, keeping ourselves
busy with proof-reading and transportation, while His
Highness Mr. Judas will be rédacteur-en-chef of the most
influential (in broad circles of
so genannten[2]

 public opinion)
little journal. But “romantic” comfort can be offered these
rechtgläubigen: let it be called “Supplement to the
Social-Democratic journal Zarya”, let them console themselves
with catchwords, but meanwhile I shall take the whole
affair into my hands. One is entitled to ask—will not the
famous “hegemony” of Social-Democracy prove under the
circumstances to be mere cant? In what will it find
expression other than in the catchword “Supplement to the
Social-Democratic journal”? That he will overwhelm us with
material is indubitable, for we can’t manage as it is to
write enough both for Zarya and Iskra.

Either the one or the other: either Sovremennoye
Obozreniye is a supplement to the journal Zarya (as arranged)
and then it should appear not more frequently than Zarya
,with complete freedom to use material for Iskra. Or we
sell our birthright for a mess of pottage and prove
genasführt[3]

 by Judas, who feeds us with catchwords.

If it is our destiny and if it is possible for us to achieve
real hegemony, it will be exclusively by means of a
political newspaper (reinforced by a scientific organ), and when
we are told with infuriating insolence that the political

    

section of our newspaper must not compete with the
political enterprise of the liberal gentlemen, our pitiful role
becomes as clear as daylight.

I have made a copy of this letter, and am appending
it to the Minutes of today’s meeting as a statement of my
protest and of my “dissenting opinion”, and I invite you
too to raise the banner of revolt. Better a break than this
factual subordination to the Credo programme alongside
loud phrases against Credo-ism.

If the majority expresses itself in favour—I shall, of
course, submit, but only after having washed my hands
of it beforehand.

Plekhanov, Georgi Valentinovich (1856-1918)—an outstanding leader
of the Russian and international labour movement, the first propagandist of
Marxism in Russia, founder of the first Russian Marxist group, the Emancipation
of Labour group (Geneva 1883). At the beginning of the twentieth century
Plekhanov, together with Lenin, edited the newspaper Iskra and the
journal Zarya, took part in drafting the Party Programme and preparing
the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. After this Congress he stood for a
conciliatory attitude towards opportunism and eventually joined the
Mensheviks. In 1908-12 Plekbanov came out against the liquidators and headed the
pro-Party Mensheviks. During the First World War (1914-18) he adopted a
social-chauvinist stand. His attitude to the October Socialist Revolution was
hostile, but he took no part in anti-Soviet activities.


Lenin thought highly of Plekhanov’s philosophical works and his role in
disseminating Marxism in Russia; at the same time

   

he sharply criticised Plekhanov for his deviations from Marxism and the serious
mistakes in his political activities. p. 55




[5]
This refers to the negotiations between the editorial board of Iskra
and the liberals concerning the publication of a supplement Sovremennoye
Obozreniye to the journal Zarya. The talks, in which Lenin,
Zasulich, Potresov, and Struve took part, started on December 29, 1900, and
continued through January 1901. Struve rejected Point 7 of the draft agreement
proposed by the Iskra and Zarya group concerning full freedom
for the editors of Iskra to use all the political material received by
Sovremennoye Obozreniye. Statements concerning the issue of
Sovremennoye Obozreniye were written by Plekhanov on behalf of
Iskra and Zarya and by Struve on behalf of the
“democratic opposition” group. The publication, however, did not
materialize in view of Dietz’s refusal to publish the statements, which
did not fulfil censorship requirements. The talks between Iskra
representatives and Struve were broken off and not resumed. p. 55




[6]
Zarya (Dawn)—a Marxist scientific and political journal,
published in Stuttgart in 1901-02 by the Iskra editorial board. Only
four numbers (three books) were issued. Zarya criticised international and
Russian revisionism, came out in defence of the theoretical premises of Marxism;
it published the following writings of Lenin dealing with this question;
“The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”
(see Vol. 5, pp. 31-80 of this edition), the first four chapters of “The
Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (see Vol. 5 of
this edition) and “The Agrarian Programme of Russian
Social-Democracy” (see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 107-50), as well as
Plekhanov’s “Criticism of Our Critics. Part 1. Mr. Struve as Critic
of Marx’s Theory of Social Development”, “Cant versus Kant, or
Herr Bernstein’s Spiritual Testament” and others. p. 56

March 20, 1901   

Dear P. B.,   

I have received all your letters and have given Auntie
news of her old
friend.[1] There was no need for you to worry
about addresses and to think that there had been any change.
I am still living at the same place and you should write
to me at the old address:

Herrn Georg Rittmeyer, Kaiserstrasse 53/0, M/"unchen.
Inside: für Meyer.

I am not expecting my wife for some time yet: her term
of exile only ends on Sunday, and she has to make some
calls on the way, so she can hardly be here before the
second half of April. Even when she does come you can still
write to
Rittmeyer,[2] for he will always forward
everything to me, and I in turn will let you know in good time
of any change of address.

We are having trouble with Zarya. That capricious  -3 gentleman
Dietz[3] definitely rejected your editorial article;
he was frightened by the references to Iskra, scented a
whiff of “groups”, etc., and referred to the fact that both
Bebel and Singer (shareholders in his G.m.b.H.) are rather
afraid,[4] and so on. To our very great regret, we had to
give up your article, replacing it by a few words “to the
readers”. This new censorship is horribly unpleasant! The
cover, too, has suffered: they deleted even “several
Russian Social-Democrats”. When shall we get rid of the
“tutelage” of these Dreck-Genossen?!

We are having unpleasantness with that Calf (Judas)
too. A very angry letter has come from his friend (=the
proposed source of money=goldene
Wanze[5]), saying: I am

    

sending 200 (two hundred!) rubles for Sovremennoye
Obozrentye, and bear in mind, he says, that it is for this
enterprise and not for yours. We are all indignant, and it has
been decided: 1) not to publish the statement about the
coalition, 2) to send the Calf and his “friend” an ultimatum
:either firm financing of our enterprise or we refuse, 3) to
finish the Witte
memorandum.[6]

Well, haven’t we been fooled again by Judas?

There is one consolation: No. 2 of Iskra has reached
Russia safely. It is a success and letters are pouring in. The
devil knows what is happening in Russia: demonstrations
in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkov, Kazan; martial law
in Moscow (by the way, they arrested my youngest sister
there and even my
brother-in-law,[7] who had never taken
part in anything!); bloody battles; prisons crammed full,
and so on.

In a few days we are expecting
Brother[8] and our
common
friend—Feld[9]—who have already left (at last!); the
latter (so far) has safely fulfilled everything required of
him.

We are publishing a May-Day
leaflet,[10] and then we
shall start on No. 3 of Iskra, and perhaps also No. 4 at the
same time—there is a lot of material.

Zarya will come out on Saturday, they say, and will
be sent to you directly from Stuttgart.

Our finances are in a very bad way. Hence for the time
being we must definitely refrain from all expenditure on
inviting a man out (proposed by you as a carrier).

All   the  very   best.


Yours,

Meyer

April 25, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I haven’t had a talk with you for a long time, I could   not get down to it and, besides, Alexei has written   to you about all business
matters,[1]

but the need of a talk   has become too great for me to put it off any
longer. I   should like to consult you about both the Parisians and
Zurichers,[7] as well as about matters in general.

Do you know that the Parisians (long ago, about two   or three weeks) have
“dissolved the Iskra promotion group”   and have
refused (for the second time) to co-operate, on   the grounds of our
having “violated organisational  -7 neutrality” (sic! that we
were unfair to the
Union[8] and wrongly   attacked it in
Zarya). This was written by the author of   “Comments on the
Programme of Rabocheye
Dyelo”,[9] who   hinted most
unambiguously that Rabocheye Dyelo was on   the mend (in
Listok
No. 6[10] it has even over-mended itself,   in our opinion!) and consequently... consequently ...  -3 Vivrons
verrons[2]

—this

“dear comrade” concluded. Obviously   (like certain “young forces” about whom G. V. wrote), he   is aiming at a better position in Rabocheye Dyelo, The sheer   scoundrelism of it made us so indignant that we did not   even answer them. In Iskra No. 4 (we have been promised   that No. 3 will be ready by May 1 and intend to start on   No. 4 immediately) we are going to flay Rabocheye Dyelo   for its shilly-shallying.

I really don’t know whether to give these intrigants up   as a bad job or to make yet another attempt. They are,
 

undoubtedly, capable people, they have written, they have   (both of them)
supplied material (Danevich as well), they   have collected money
skilfully (as much as 350  -2 frs—nowhere yet has so much been collected
abroad for Iskra).   As a matter of fact, we are not blameless
either in regard   to them: we have not paid them sufficient attention, we
  have not sent a single article for examination and  -3 “comradely
advice”, we have not offered any “section” (if only   a foreign review
in Iskra or comments in a social chronicle   on certain
issues). Apparently, under the conditions  -6 obtaining abroad, it is
impossible, quite impossible, not to have   something of the
sort. Now take the
Berliners[11] (Arsenyev   was there recently)—they too want a definite
position;   simply to help Iskra, they say, can satisfy a
student, but   we or Dvinskaya (she and her husband are
withdrawing   from the Union, in which, when the members were questioned,
  only
three—Grishin[12] y compris!—expressed themselves   in favour of the conference. Vive camarade G.!) require,   they say, something of the sort, you know....

I just don’t know what to do! It is necessary to “invent”   an organisation—without that es geht
nicht.[3]


It has occurred to me that the following plan of  -8 organisation could be
tried: the Sotsial-Demokrat
organisation,[13]   the editorial
board of Zarya and various groups (the  -3 Berliners, for
example, the Parisians, perhaps, etc.), or various   persons,
unite in a
League,[14] let us say. Literary activity   to be handled in three ways: the Emancipation of Labour   group has its print-shop, Zarya has its own, with an elected   Literary Committee as closest collaborator, taking part in   periodic joint editorial sessions and publishing (over the   signature of the Literary Committee) pamphlets, etc., in   the print-shops of Sotsial-Demokrat and Zarya—eventuell   also in a third print-shop should the League set one up   (there is such a prospect). The supreme decision on literary   questions in the League will belong to a conference of three   members: from the Emancipation of Labour group, from   Zarya, and from the Literary Committee, There will be a   joint, elected management.
 

Such, in substance, is my plan (of course, Iskra, being
a Russian publication, does not formally come into the
League). In principle this plan is approved here—by
Elder Sister too. I believe that such a “constitution”
(“Austrian” Alexei jokingly calls it) holds no dangers for us, and
something of the kind is absolutely necessary, otherwise
there will be general dissatisfaction and we may lose all
our people. In this way we shall be fully guaranteed against
dissensions and squabbles, keeping full control of our
printshops and editorial boards, while giving people the
requisite scope without which they will not agree to co-operate.

Please write what you think of this idea, and talk it
over with G. V. (to whom I am not writing, for he should
soon be here and will, of course, call on you on the way).
I am not going into details; they can be easily settled. If
we all (i.e., the whole Sotsial-Demokrat) agree on this,
the chances are that the Berliners (who have a print-shop
and are eager to “work” from a definite “position”) will
join us, and then we shall be able to counterpose to the
Union a united “League” developing extensive activities.

There is no need to fear an elected management, for it
will only control transport and the collection of money
abroad, divided in a definite proportion between
Sotsial-Demokrat, Zarya, etc., but it will not have anything to
do with Iskra, which informally will be behind Zarya and
together with Zarya. Formally the League can be declared
the ally abroad of the Iskra organisation in Russia, which
we are already establishing.

Nor is there any need to fear literary stupidities, for
(1) the Literary Committee can be bound by its Rules as
far as independent publishing is concerned; (2) it will
publish over its own signature: the Emancipation of Labour
group and Zarya will not be confused with it; (3) our
people as well can be in it; (4) it will be subordinated to the
conference, in which we have a majority.

I don’t know, of course, whether this will satisfy the
Parisians—they are so proud. We feel awkward about
approaching them. If you approve of the plan, would you
care to write to them and throw out a feeler, seeing that
they spoke to you earlier in Paris about their sad situation;
you could now suggest this way out to them. If you ap-

    

prove of the idea, we shall get in touch with Koltsov and
ask him to draft Rules for the
League.[4]


Now about the Lettish Zurichers. I don’t know whether
you have heard that the transport arranged with their help
came to grief: 3,000 copies of Iskra (No. 1) were seized by
the police, who got hold of the smuggler as well. Later
one of them wrote to us, asking for more fare money. We
replied that we could not give any more for this route—
we would not dare to put it before our organisation—but
if he would undertake specially to get one pood across (as
he undertook to do when he talked with me), then let him
come and pick it up.

There was not a word in reply. Do you know whether,
perhaps, they have taken offence? What are they doing
and planning? If you see any of them, please have a talk
to find out how matters stand.

We are beginning to think about No. 2 of Zarya—it is
time to do so. The Witte memorandum will soon be
finished,[5]

in about 2-3 weeks (for some reason Dietz is incredibly
slow with it; so far only 9 sheets are ready). So far we have
no material apart from Nevzorov’s article on the historical
preparation of Russian Social-Democracy which you already
know about. We are hoping for a leading article by G. V.
on recent events, his article contra Struve, your article
(from editorial comments)—that’s true, isn’t it?; an article
by Luxemburg is promised (a new introduction to her
articles “Die sozialistische Krise in
Frankreich”,[6]

which
articles we intend to translate), and Kautsky has promised
an article on academicians and proletarians.

We have no foreign reviews. How do matters stand with
the “Austrian” article? Isn’t anything coming from
America?—and from Switzerland? It is said that Danevich is
ill. There is no one we can ask to write about Germany—^M
apart from Parvus, who promised (?) a foreign review but
that is not quite the thing.
 

In the fourth issue of Iskra it is proposed to have an
article on terrorism (by Alexei); there is: “The Autocracy
and the Zemstvo” (continuation), “The Autocracy and
Finance” (by Parvus), something for the social chronicle (there
is a supplement on demonstrations) and the working-class
movement. We are thinking of issuing No. 4 in a single
sheet (No. 3 has expanded so much, to two sheets, 8 pages
(seven pages are now ready), like No. 1—and part had
to be left out!). We must exert every effort to expedite the
publication, of Iskra—to make it a monthly.

Good-bye! All the best. Regards to all your family. From
my wife too.

Yours,

Petrov

P.S. Write to me at Rittmeyer’s.

Before I forget: on the instructions of Elder Sister
I inform you that 250 frs. has been received. The report
on this is published in Iskra No. 3 (“From America through
Axelrod”). I am sending you via Stuttgart 10 copies
of Zarya—send them to Ingerman, Mokrjyevich, etc. Elder
Sister is writing an article for the Germans on the
demonstrations.

on Lenin’s proposal, united with the foreign section of the
Iskra organisation into the League of Russian Revolutionary
Social-Democracy Abroad. p. 61




[14]
Lenin’s plan was carried out in October 1901, when the League of
Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was founded. Affiliated to
the League were the foreign section of the Iskra organisation, and
the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation. The task the League was to
disseminate the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and promote the
building up of a militant Social-Democratic organisation. The League was
the representative abroad of the Iskra organisation. It issued
several bulletins and pamphlets, including Lenin’s To the Rural
Poor (see Vol. 6 of this edition).


The R.S.D.L.P.’s Second Congress endorsed the League as the only
Party organisation abroad having the status of a committee and working
under the guidance and control of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. After the Second Congress the Mensheviks entrenched themselves
in the League and launched a struggle against the Bolsheviks. At the
League’s second congress in October 1903 the Mensheviks slandered the
Bolsheviks, upon which Lenin and his followers walked out. The Mensheviks
got new Rules adopted, directed against the Party Rules approved by the
Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. From then on the League became a
stronghold of Menshevism. It existed until 1905. p. 61

May 24, 1901

We received your letter with the report for January,
February, March and April. Thanks for the detailed and
clear list of income and expenditure. But as regards your
activity in general, we are still unclear what exactly this
activity is and what its results are. You wrote that you
have your hands full and there is no one to replace you,
but you have still not kept your promise to describe, this
activity. Is your work confined to forwarding literature
to the points named in the report? Or are you engaged in
forming a group or groups? If so, where and what kind,
what has been done already, and what are these groups
for—for local work, for sending to us for literature, or for something else?

We ask about this because the question is very important.
Things with us are going none too well. We are bad off
financially, Russia gives almost nothing. Shipping is still
unorganised and haphazard. Under these conditions, our
“tactics” must aim wholly at 1) sending here the fullest
possible amount of the money collected in Russia for Iskra,
and reducing local expenditure to a minimum; 2) spending
money almost exclusively on shipment, as we already have
receiving agents functioning in Pskov and Poltava who are
comparatively very cheap and no burden on our exchequer.

Please think this over carefully. Our daily bread, by
which we barely manage to keep alive, consists as before
solely of suitcases. For a couple of them we pay about a
hundred rubles, and the chance nature of the persons sent
entails a vast amount of delay, carelessness, loss, etc.
Nothing is being done to organise the sending of “suitcasers”
from Riga (which, according to both Raznotsvetov and

    

Ernst, is possible). There is no news from
Leopold.[2]
 Nothing is being arranged in Finland, although this is also
possible, as we are assured from various quarters. Is it
reasonable, in such a state of affairs-, to spend 400 rubles
in four months on local reception and intermediaries for
forwarding literature?

We think you should move into the immediate vicinity
of the frontier for the sake of shipping at least 2-4
suitcases and 10–20 pounds per month by personal handling.
What do you say to this?

May 25, 1901

Dear P. B.,

You have already heard, of course, from G. V. of the
plan for our organisation and of the new “conciliatory”
enterprise of Nevzorov, Danevich and Ryazanov (who have
taken the title of the Borba group[3]). We answered their
inquiry (whether we agreed to a preliminary conference
between Sotsial-Demokrat, the Union, and Zarya, i.e., their
representatives) by consenting. G. V. said here that, of course,
it was necessary to agree and that he had already written
to you about it. Today Ryazanov (who has already spent
about two days here) told me that he had received a letter
from Gurevich, who informed him that official agreement
had been received only from us, that so far there was still
nothing from the Emancipation of Labour group, that he
had seen Krichevsky and Ivanshin and was almost sure
of their agreement to the conference, that the place
suggested is Brussels and the date about June 4, and that the
Bund organisation abroad[4] also wished to attend the
conference.

Please write to them as soon as possible about the official
agreement to the conference on the part of the
Emancipation of Labour group (as the representative of
Sotsial-Demokrat), and about your attitude to the question of
place and
time.[1]

On the first point we wrote that we are
in favour of Zurich or some place closest to it (and that
Switzerland, of course, is the most convenient place also
for the Emancipation of Labour group) and that we should

    

like the conference to be held quickly, if possible in May,
for in June we have not so much free time at our disposal.
(Our desire to hasten the conference is really to be explained
by the fact that it is more advantageous to us to get it over
quickly so as to begin our own organisation sooner and have
time for preparing for a decisive fight against the Union
in the event of a break. The fight, probably, will be shifted
to Russia, too, in the summer.)

Please support our desire to hasten the
conference[2]

(putting forward any sort of grounds) and to hold it in
Switzerland. I think they can hardly object to Switzerland,
firstly, because two of the four (Zarya and Sotsial-Demokrat
against the Union and Borba) are in favour of Switzerland;
secondly, Switzerland is bound to be the natural place for
a congress of representatives of the Swiss, German and
French groups. Perhaps it would be possible to agree not
on Zurich but on Basle, for instance? Let me know, please,
when you send your official agreement.

I shall now tell you about Ryazanov. On the question
of our organisation (the Iskra organisation abroad) he at
first got into a huff when he learnt that we had no intention
of enlarging the editorial board and were proposing only
a deliberative role for them. He spoke with feeling about
Nevzorov being a man who had a great past and services
to his credit (exactly the way Nevzorov last summer spoke
about Ryazanov!)—he expressed indignation, resorted to
irony, and so on and so forth. But a little later, seeing that
all this hadn’t the slightest effect on us, he became disposed
to make concessions. He declared that he, perhaps, would
agree to our plan “(Nevzorov would never agree”), but the
best thing would be a federation between Sotsial-Demokrat,
Zarya and Borba, that Borba was ready to give up the idea
of publishing its own organ (we never believed they could
set one up) and confine itself to a series of pamphlets.

On the whole, it looks as if it will be possible to work
with them; they may jib a little, but will nevertheless
join in.

As far as a rapprochement with the Union is concerned,
Ryazanov at first stated that he did not put any hopes at

    

all on the conference, that it was only Gurevich who
entertained such an idea, and so forth. But when he learnt that
We were not making the abolition of the Union a conditio
sine qua non, and that we were ready to allow the existence
of a scientific organ (Zarya) and a political newspaper
(Iskra) side by side with a popular miscellany or workers’
journal (Rabocheye Dyelo), he made a decisive change of
front and declared that he had long ago spoken about this
to Krichevsky, that he regarded it as the natural way of
ending discord and that he himself was now ready to work
for the realisation of such a plan. Let him do some work!
Perhaps amalgamation or federation on such a basis will
really occur—it would be a big step forward.

Another reason why we are in favour of Zurich, I would
add, is that Alexei is anxious to have more time to talk
over all kinds of matters with you.

If the questioning of all members of Sotsial-Demokrat
(for an official answer to the Borba group) requires much
time, please try, if possible, to shorten this time somehow.
Delay in calling the conference is extremely undesirable.

Regarding participation of the Bund organisation
abroad, we think it should be refused (without making a
casus belli out of it in the last resort) on the grounds of
paragraph 1 of the decisions of the Congress of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1898. (On the strength
of this paragraph the Bund is autonomous only in questions
specifically concerning the Jewish proletariat and,
consequently, cannot act as an independent party to
negotiations.)

How about your article for Iskra? Do you intend to
provide something for the second booklet of Zarya, about which
G. V., of course, has told you?

With warmest greetings and best regards from all of us.

Yours,

Petrov

[3]
The Borba group was formed in Paris in the summer of 1900 and consisted of
D. B. Ryazanov, Y. M. Steklov and E. L. Gurevich.

   

The name Borba (Struggle) was adopted by the group in May 1901. In
an attempt to reconcile the revolutionary and opportunist trends in Russian
Social-Democracy, the Borba group took the initiative in convening
(in June 1901) the Geneva conference of representatives of the
Social-Democratic organisations abroad—the Iskra and
Zarya editorial board, the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation,
the Foreign Committee of the Bund and the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
Abroad—and took part in the “unity” conference of the
R.S.D.L.P.’s organisations abroad at Zurich (September 21-22 [October
4-51], 1901). In November 1901 the group issued a programmatic
“Advertisement of the Publications of the Social-Democratic
Borba Group”. In its publications the group distorted the
revolutionary theory of Marxism, interpreted it in a doctrinaire scholastic
spirit and was hostile to Lenin’s organisational principles for
building up the Party. Owing to its deviations from Social-Democratic views
and tactics, its disruptive activities and lack of contact with the
Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, the group was refused admission
to the Second Congress, by whose decision it was dissolved. p. 67




[4]
The Bund—the General Jewish Workers’ Union of
Lithuania, Poland and Russia—was organised at an inaugural congress
of Jewish Social-Democratic groups held in Vilna in 1897; it united mostly
semi-proletarian elements of the Jewish artisans in the Western regions of
Russia. At the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (1898) the Bund joined the
Party “as an autonomous organisation, independent only as far as
questions affecting the Jewish proletariat are concerned”
(K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsii i
plenumov TsK [The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its
Congresses, Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee], Part 1,
1954, p. 14).


The Bund brought nationalism and separatism into the Russian working-class
movement and took an opportunist stand on the most important issues of the
Social-Democratic movement. After the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. rejected the Bund’s demand that it be recognised as the
sole representative of the Jewish proletariat, the Bund left the Party,
rejoining it in 1906 on the basis of a decision of the Fourth (Unity)
Congress.


Within the R.S.D.L.P. the Bundists constantly supported its opportunist
wing (the Economists, Mensheviks and liquidators) and waged a struggle
against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. To the Bolshevik programme’s
demand for the right of nations to self-determination the Bund opposed the
demand for autonomy of the national culture. During the years of reaction
(1907-10) the Bund adopted a liquidators stand and took an active part in
forming the anti-Party August bloc. During the First World War (1914-18)
the Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand. In 1917 the Bund supported the
counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the side of the
enemies of the October Socialist Revolution, its leaders joining forces
with the counter-revolution during the years of foreign military
intervention and

   

civil war. At the same time a swing towards co-operation with the Soviet
government was to be observed among the Bund’s rank and file. In
March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself. p. 67

How do you propose printing Iskra in Russia? At a secret
printing-press or a legal one? If the latter, write
immediately whether you have anything definite in view; we are
ready to snatch at this plan with both hands (it is, possible,
we have been assured, in the Caucasus), and it would not
require much
money.[1]

If the former, bear in mind that
in our printed sheet (4 pages) there are about 100,000
characters [and that each month!]; would a secret
printingpress be able to cope with that? Will it not waste a vast
amount of money and people with excessively great risk?
Would it not be better to use this money and energy on
shipments, which Russia, in any case, cannot do without.

Doctor[1]

should take up residence at the frontier, in
Polangen for example (we have connections with the
non-Russian side in those places, and we have also our own
depot), study the local conditions (he would have to know
Lettish and German there, but perhaps one could manage
without, that), try to find a plausible occupation (we are
assured that it is possible to live there by private practice),
establish good relations with the local petty officials and
accustom them to frequent crossings of the frontier. The
frontier there is crossed not with a passport, but with a
Grenzkarte[2]

(valid for 28 days). With such frequent
crossings it will be possible to carry across (on one’s person or
in a suitcase by our method, which requires a small case
for medical instruments) a little at a time, some pounds
of literature on each occasion. It is very important for us
that the crossings should be regular and frequent, even
if with very little at a time. If the person will undertake
to arrange this and do the work himself, we will give him
the fare money and a couple of months’ living expenses,
until he settles down.

A further shipment to Persia via Vienna was made only
recently, so it is premature to talk of failure. It may be
successful. Inform the addressee in Tabriz that he will
be receiving books from Berlin and write us when they are
received.

As regards arrangements for printing Iskra in the
Caucasus, we have already sent X a detailed inquiry but have
not yet had an
answer.[1]

We must know exactly what the
plan is (whether a legal or an illegal printing-press), how
feasible it is, what amount of printed matter it reckons
on (can Iskra be printed monthly?), how much money is
needed initially and per month. Our funds just now are
very low, and we cannot make any promises until we have
detailed information, which please send immediately.

Make every effort to obtain money. We have already
written about this through X to one of your acquaintances
and advise you to ask ZZ also to take up the matter; one
of the members of the Iskra group already spoke to him
about money at the beginning of last year (remind him
of the conversation in a theatre in one of the
capitals).[3]

As regards the Eastern shore of the Black Sea, you must
look for routes without fail. Devote your efforts especially
to the French steamships—we hope to find a means of
contact with them from here.

Galperin, L. Y. (1872-1951)—a Social-Democrat, joined the
revolutionary movement in 1898. While in exile, in Astrakhan Gubernia, he
established contact with Iskra organisation and was sent to Baku
as its agent in the spring of 1901, where he worked at setting up the Baku
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., and an illegal printing-press, and at
organising the transportation of illegal literature from abroad and its
distribution in Russia.


After the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. he joined the Bolsheviks and
for a time represented the editorial board of the Party’s Central
Organ on the Party Council and was afterwards co-optated to the Central
Committee. Adopted a conciliatory attitude towards Menshevism and was
against convening the Third Congress of the Party. Retired from active
political work in 1906. p. 72

We have just received news from Nikolai (=Ernst) of
the shipment to him of 4 1/2 poods, which he has in a safe
place; that is the first thing. The second is that he always
has an opportunity of getting our man together with the
smuggler across the frontier and that such people are
needed. So we make the following proposal to you: take a trip
to the spot at once, travel with one of your passports to
Nikolai in Memel, find out about everything from him,
then cross the frontier by Grenzkarte or with a smuggler,
pick up the literature lying on this side (i.e., in Russia)
and deliver it everywhere. It is obvious that for success
in this matter it is essential to have one more person from
the Russian side to help Nikolai and exercise control over
him, someone always ready to cross the frontier secretly,
but chiefly occupied with receiving literature on the
Russian side and forwarding it to Pskov, Smolensk, Vilna,
Poltava. [We have lost faith altogether in Nikolai and
his Co.; we have decided not to give them another farthing
and we can hope to use this route only on condition that
a wholly reliable man of ours takes a direct part in the
shipments. ] You would be a suitable man for this, for (1) you
have already visited Nikolai once, and (2) you have two
passports. It is a difficult and serious matter, requiring
changes of residence, but it is also most important for us.
Think it over carefully and reply immediately, without
putting it off for a single day. If you are not prepared to
undertake this job, we must find someone else for it
immediately. Hence we once again earnestly request you to
reply at once.

July 7, 1901 

Dear G.V.,

How is your work going? All this time I have been
wanting to write you about the ending to Orthodox’s article,
i.e., the later addendum concerning Berdayev’s
article[2]
in No. 6 of Mir Bozhy. Our
Struvefreundliche Partei[3]
rejected this ending by a majority of 2 3/4 votes against 1 1/4
(Alexei “divided himself” into 3/4 and 1/4)—I was left in the
minority with my “in favour”. They didn’t like the note
on romantic love either, no? the general character of the
addendum. In my opinion, however, it gave a brief, sharp,
clear and business-like rebuff to the gentleman in question?
the concluding verses are especially good!

We are again told in letters from Russia that there is
to be a congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party—in one town even an invitation has been received.
It is extremely important to make haste with the programme.
Write, please, whether you are thinking of
undertaking and can undertake this work. Apart from you and
P. B. there is really no one: the formulation requires
intensive thinking put, but with the bustle existing here, for
example, it is quite impossible to concentrate and give
proper thought to it. Those old drafts of the programme
and the article (that is, one draft and one article) which.
Alexei brought you—and which he quite wrongly took
back—are hardly likely to be of much use, are they? What
do you think? If, however, you need them, we shall
immediately send them to you.

I have ordered Shakhovskoi and
Tezyakov.[4] Why do
you need them for the programme? You are not thinking
of drawing up demands for the agricultural workers on the
basis of them, are you? And what is your attitude to demands

    

for the peasantry? Do you in general accept the possibility
of such demands in the Russian Social-Democratic
programme?

The proofs of your article have not yet come. Zarya No. 2
contains: Old Believer on Russkoye Bogatstvo, V. I. on
Berdayev, I have written on the Witte memorandum and
trounced the
Preface[5] (I am thinking of sending it to
you for your advice, but I don’t know whether there will
be enough time), Alexei has an essay on “The Tasks of
the Socialist Intelligentsia”—you have seen it, what do you
think of it? I shall write, too, against
Chernov.[1]

.

And will
you do the review of the miscellany At the Post of Honour?

For Iskra (No. 6 is being set up and will appear in July,
No. 7 should appear in August) we are expecting from you
articles concerning the letter of a worker and on the
“Rebirth of Revolutionism in Russia”.

Parvus is still standing by his “organisation”!

Kautsky passed through here. He is going on holiday
and does not promise to write anything just now.

Nevzorov has sent Iskra a “disgusting” (the comment
of V. I. and Puttman) article against the article “Where
To
Begin”[6]—a hymn to the committees, a defence
(evasive) of Rabocheye Dyelo, etc. We shall return it to the
author (we shall make a copy and send it to you, if you like).

Yes, regarding the plan of federation or amalgamation
with the Union, I hope you have seen our counter-plan?
If not, ask Koltsov to get it from Dvinskaya. I doubt
whether anything will come of this.

All the very best.


Yours....

Oh, yes, about the money from the Belgians for our
movement. I think one-third should be given to Rabocheye
Dyelo: for the sake of 50–100 francs it is not worth while
to give cause even for talk.

We have just received a letter with the plan of Pakhomy’s
Brother, Yablochkov and Bruskov. We cannot conceal that
not only are we unable to agree with any part of this plan
(though the first part is perhaps debatable), but we were
simply astonished by it, especially by the second part,
namely: 1) that everyone move to St. Petersburg, 2) that
a regional organ of the Iskra organisation in Russia be
established. So astonished that we apologise beforehand
for any too sharp word that may slip into our comments.

It is unbelievable! After a whole year of desperate efforts
we have barely succeeded in starting to form a staff of
leaders arid organisers in Russia for this vast and most urgent
task (this staff is still terribly small, for we have only 2-3
persons in addition to the three mentioned above, whereas
an all-Russia organ requires more than one dozen such
energetic collaborators, taking this word not merely in a
literary sense), and suddenly the edifice is to be dismantled
again and we are to return to the old primitive methods!
I cannot imagine more suicidal tactics for Iskra! A regional
organ like the existing Yuzhny
Rabochy[2] means a mass
of money and personnel expended all over again on editorial
offices, technical facilities, delivery arrangements, etc., and
for the sake of what? For the sake of five issues in eighteen
months! Even this it will not be able to do now in eighteen
months, for Yuzhny Rabochy had the advantage of being
founded by a full-formed Committee, i.e., by a whole
organisation at the apogee of its development. At present
there are only three of you. If, instead of combating the
narrowness which makes the St. Petersburger forget about
Moscow, the Muscovite about St. Petersburg, the Kiev

    

man about everything except Kiev, if instead of training
people to handle all-Russia affairs (it takes years to train
them for this, if we want to build a political party worthy
of the name), if, instead of this, we shall again encourage
primitive methods, local narrowness and the development
of a Gothamite instead of an all-Russia Social-Democracy,
it will be nothing but Gothamite foolishness, it cannot
be anything else. It has been found out by experience how
unequipped we are for creating a really political organ,
how few contributors and reporters we have, how few people
with political connections, how few practical workers to
handle technical jobs and distribution.

Russia has few of them, as it is, without our splintering
them still further and dropping an all-Russia undertaking
that has already been launched and which needs all-round
support, for the sake of founding a new local enterprise.
At best, in the event of this new plan being a shining
success, it will lower the standard of Russian Social-Democracy,
lower its political significance, because there cannot be a
“local” political newspaper, since in a local organ the
general-political section is always bound to suffer. You
write: a “mass” organ. We totally fail to understand what
kind of animal this is. Do you mean to say that Pakhomy’s
Brother, too, has begun to think that we must descend to
a lower level, from the advanced workers to the mass,
that we must write more simply and closer to life? Do you
mean to say our aim is to descend closer to the “mass”
instead of raising this already stirring mass to the level of
an organised political movement? Is it letters from factories
and workshops that we lack, and not political exposures,
political knowledge and political generalisations? And
in order to extend and deepen our political generalisations
we are invited to fragment our work as a whole into regional
undertakings! And besides depreciating the cause
politically they will inevitably depreciate it technically by the
plan for a regional organ. By combining all forces on Iskra,
we can set up a monthly newspaper (this has now been
proved after a year’s experience) with really political
material, but in the case of a regional organ it is impossible just
now to think even of four issues per annum. If we don’t
skip impatiently from one plan to another, and are not put

 

out by temporary setbacks and the slow growth of an
all-Russia undertaking, it would be quite possible after six
months or a year to achieve, a fortnightly organ (which is
persistently in our thoughts). We assume, of course, that
Pakhomy’s Brother, Yablochkov and Bruskov stand by the
previous line, approving both the political trend and the
organisational plan of Iskra, but if they have altered their
views on these matters, that is quite a different question,
of course. We are quite at a loss to understand why these
people have lost confidence in this plan, and so quickly
too (because they cannot fail to see that the new plan
destroys the old one). Is it because of shipments? So far we
have attempted only once to arrange a route and this
attempt has not yet led to a complete failure—and even after
two or three failures we ought not to throw up the sponge.
Have not these people begun to sympathise with
publication in Russia, rather than abroad? Surely they know that
everything was done for the former and about 1,000 rubles
spent, but so far without result. We must say that in general
we consider that any plan for publishing any sort of regional
Or local organ of the Iskra organisation in Russia is
decidedly incorrect and harmful. The Iskra organisation exists
to support and develop the paper, and to unite the Party
through it, and not for a dispersion of our forces, of which
there is more than enough without this organisation. As
for everyone going to St. Petersburg, we can only say that
we have very few Party workers like P. B. and Pakhomy’s
Brother and we need to preserve them. Living in one place,
the danger of a general roundup is a hundred times greater.
If they find that one person there is not enough (it’s for
them to decide), let them add to him the one who is being
released in the autumn (Pakhomy’s Brother), but not both.
And then, for the sake of both security and united work, let
them not forget that it is extremely desirable to change
their place of residence from time to time. If, finally,
success were achieved in winning over the Committee in St.
Petersburg, it should, of course, be made to devote itself
heart and soul to Iskra and its more frequent publication,
and to oppose all new primitive undertakings. Primitivism
is a much more dangerous enemy than Economism, for
vital roots of Economism, we are profoundly convinced,

    

are deeply buried in primitivism. And there will never
be any political movement (political not in words only,
but in fact, i.e., one directly influencing the government
and preparing a general assault) until we overcome this
primitivism and eradicate all belief in it. If St. Petersburg
has bought 400 copies of Yuzhny Rabochy,
the Sotsialist[3]
group has set about distributing 1,000 copies of Iskra
Let them organise the distribution of this number of copies,
let them arrange for it to contain a detailed St. Petersburg
section (if necessary, it will be a special supplement), and
then there will have been accomplished the very task that
has overshadowed for you all other tasks of winning over
St. Petersburg. Let us remind you that all “practical
workers” are agreed that Yuzhny Rabochy has no
advantages over Iskra as regards accessibility to workers, so that
this argument, too, falls to the ground. It is absurd and
criminal to disperse forces and funds—Iskra has no money,
not a single Russian agent is obtaining a farthing for it,
and yet everyone is thinking up some new undertaking
requiring new funds. All this shows a lack of self-discipline.
We must be more patient; by means of our plan we shall
achieve our ends, albeit not so soon, whereas what can be
reckoned on by implementing the proposed plan is clear
from the lamentable experience of Rabocheye
Znamya.[4]
Our friends began to carry out their plan in such haste
that Yablochkov travelled to St. Petersburg in defiance
of the condition laid down, abandoning Odessa, in which
the presence of our agent was essential. We demand that
the new plan be discarded. If our arguments are thought
unconvincing, let all new plans be put off until our
congress, which we shall convene, if necessary, when the
thing has been got going. As far as popular literature is
concerned, the idea is to extend the publication of popular
pamphlets. This letter expresses the opinion not only of
our group but also of the Emancipation of Labour group.

Tsederbaum, Sergei Ostpovich (1879-1939)—joined the
Social-Democratic movement in 1898. Worked on the organisation of transport
facilities for Iskra publications. After the Second Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. became an active Menshevik. After the October Socialist
Revolution retired from political activities. p. 76

Yuzhny Rabochy (Southern Worker)—a Social-Democratic illegal
newspaper, published from January 1900 to April 1903 by a group of this
name. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the group’s delegates
adopted a “Centre” position (that of “middling
opportunists”, as Lenin called the representatives of the
Centre). The Second Congress decided to dissolve the Yuzhny
Rabochy group as well as all separate Social-Democratic groups and
organisations. p. 76




[3]
The Sotsialist group was organised in St. Petersburg in the summer
of 1900. It was one of the groups that were dissatisfied with the Economist
tendency of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, and gave prominence to
the political struggle. In January 1901 it amalgamated with the
Rabocheye Znamya group. The group broke up after the arrests in
the spring of 1901. p. 79




[4]
The Rabocheye Znamya group (Workers’ Banner) came into being
during the second half of 1897. It disapproved of Economism and set itself
the aim of conducting political propaganda among the workers. It published
the newspaper Rabocheye Znamya (three issues were put out) and
several pamphlets and leaflets. In January 1901 the St. Petersburg
Rabocheye Znamya group amalgamated with the Sotsialist
group, but in the course of January-April the members of the united group
who were in Russia were arrested. Most of the members of the St. Petersburg
Rabocheye Znamya group joined the Iskra
organisation. p. 79

July 25,  1901   

Dear G. V.,

Yesterday I received the books on the agrarian question.
Thank you for them. I am pretty deeply immersed in
my “agrarian” article against Chernov (and partly Hertz
and Bulgakov). I think this Chernov needs to be trounced
unmercifully.[1]


Velika was here just now and read extracts from your
letter to her. As regards the proofs, we have already done
“everything in our power”, i.e., we have sent Dietz
corrections to be inserted in the text if it is not too late; if
it is, we shall specify them without fail at the end of the
book so that there will be no great harm done really. My
wife read the proofs and compared them with the
manuscript (the phrase on which you have made the marginal
note, “I didn’t have that!” proved to be a slip of the pen on
your part. As I have just seen from the manuscript, you
actually did write “the May uprising”. We have corrected
this too). Since proof-reader mistakes are unavoidable,
we shall from now on apply the “tactics” proposed by you:
we shall send the author the first proofs (the second will
be too late), for him to correct not individual letters and
characters, since that will be done by the proof-reader and
is indeed not important, but only places where the sense
is distorted by the omission of words and phrases or by
the replacement of one word by another.
 

I received my
article[2]

from P. B. with his letter. P. B.
is also in favour of toning it down. Needless to say, I have
already introduced all the mitigations concretely indicated
by you and P. B. As regards changing the whole tone Of
the article, or replacing all attacks by tongue-in-cheek
edification, although I like this plan of yours, I doubt
whether I could do it. If I didn’t feel any “irritation”
against the author I would not have written like that. But
since there is “irritation” (understandable not only to us
but to every Social-Democratic reader of the preface), I am
no longer able to conceal it, and cannot exercise cunning
here. I shall try to tone it down still more and make
still further reservations; perhaps something will come
of it.

I shall pass on to Alexei your comments on his essay (he
has long been looking forward to them). He probably
forgot to tell you that he himself passed his subject about
Mikhailovsky on to Ryazanov (the latter is now writing
it). I understood that you were writing a review of At the
Post of Honour, which we sent you.

All the very best.


Yours....

If you see Koltsov, give him many thanks from me for
Volnoye
Slovo.[3]

O yes, I almost forgot. I should like to ask your advice
on the following question. This same swine Chernov quotes
F. Engels’s article “The German Peasant” in Russkoye
Bogatstvo, 1900, No. 1, where at the end Engels says that
it is necessary to “restore the Mark”. I found this article.
It turned out to be a translation of the Anhang to the
Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft—
“Die Mark”; moreover in “Russkoye Bogatstvo” at the end
two paragraphs (18 lines) have been inserted which are absent
in the original. I compared all the rest of the translation
paragraph by paragraph, but the devil knows where these
two paragraphs have come from. This outrage ought to
be exposed, only—isn’t there a misunderstanding here

    

perhaps? Isn’t there another text of this article by Engels?
In a note to the Russian translation, the editors of
Russkoye Bogatstvo say:

“This article of his (Engels) appeared in the eighties
tin 1882? the preface to Entwicklung is marked September
21, 1882] in a German magazine [? Neue Zeit? or Zuricher
Sozialdemokrat?[4] Do you know? ] without his signature
[?]. But in a copy of it, which Engels sent to one of his
friends [sic! Danielson? Did you hear anything about this
from Engels? ] he signed it with his initials.” In addition,
it is said, the historical part of the article is identical with
the preface to “Schlesische Milliarde” and with an article
in Neue Rheinische
Zeitung[5] (April-March 1849).

Could you help me to get to the bottom of this? Wasn’t
there another text of the article “Die Mark” in Neue
Rheinische Zeitung or elsewhere? Gould Engels later have thrown
out the end about “the restoration of the Mark”?

July 26,  1901

Dear P. B.,

I have received and carefully read your letter (so has
Alexei). I was very glad that you set out your remarks in
such
detail.[3] Only you are wrong in thinking that I am
too (“pretty”) “stubborn”, I have accepted all your
suggestions about toning down definite passages (as well as
all suggestions of G. V.), that is, I have toned it down
everywhere. “A kopek on the ruble” will unite all the workers:
I have added “in the opinion of the Economists” in brackets.
Instead of “restriction of the autocracy” I have put
“destruction”, as you suggested. On pp. 82–83 I have deleted
altogether what was incautious in the sense of our views on
utilising the liberals (i.e., incautiously expressed ideas),
as you advised. I have also inserted a note with a reference
to your pamphlet The Historical Situation, pointing out
that the question only slightly touched upon by me has
been analysed in detail by you. I have inserted a couple
of words to the effect that one can be glad of the greater
understanding of the workers’ movement shown by the
liberals (in the person of R. N. S.). I have deleted altogether
“regret” at the publication of the Witte memorandum with
such a preface. I have also deleted some sharp remarks
in the first and the second half of the article. In general,
I am not at all so stubborn about toning down specific
remarks, but as a matter of principle I cannot give up the
idea that it is our right (and our duty) to trounce R. N. S.
for his political juggling. He is precisely a political
juggler—reading and re-reading the preface has definitely
convinced me of this, and in my criticism I brought in
everything that the last few months have shown us (i.e.,Verhand-

    

lungen[1]

with “Calf”, attempts at an agreement,
etc.[2]

I got a weight off my chest, so to speak, in settling accounts
with this individual. I regarded elucidation of the
constitutional nature of the Zemstvo as the crux of the whole
article. Zemstvo liberalism is, in the sphere of its influence
on society, the same thing as Economism in the sphere of
the latter’s influence on the workers. We must attack the
narrowness of both the one and the other.

Tomorrow, probably, the question of the article will
be decided here. If it goes to press now, I shall try to send
you a copy of the first proof; you may have further
suggestions, and we can still manage to touch it up (while the
first and second proofs are being corrected).

I send you warm greetings and wishes for a good rest
and recuperation. For this it would be best, perhaps, not
to send you anything for the time being? So as not to spoil
your holiday and treatment?

Yours,

Petrov

July 30, 1901   

Dear G. V.,

I received your letter from the country and the new books
(Final Report, Blondel et Vandervelde et Destrée), for which
many thanks.

I did not get
Tezyakov[4]; probably it won’t come at all
,as it was ordered from Kalmykova’s
store[5] and she is
being exiled from St. Petersburg for three years andis
closing down the store (the latest and quite accurate news!).

I am sending you
Kuleman[6] today.

As regards the forgery in Russkoye Bogatstvo concerning
Engels,[1]

I shall take all possible steps.

As regards reviews, we have little definite information.
All are busy with their own articles (Velika—against
Berdayev, Puttman with magazine notes=against Russkoye
Bogatstvo, I with my agrarian
article,[2]

etc.). Moreover,
there is still time for reviews.

I have sent my article against R. N. S. to the press after
toning down a number of sharp
passages.[3]

I have also
written a postscript to it, in which I draw a parallel
between an article of
Dragomanov’s[7] (“Knock, and it shall
be opened unto you”) and that of R. N. S., to the advantage
of the former. There, too, I am toning down a few expressions
(on Velika’s insistence). But the general tone of my
strictures can no longer be subject to radical revision.
 

Letters from Russia say that our people are terribly taken
with Berdayev. There you have someone who asks to be
trounced, and not only in the specifically philosophical
sphere! True, Velika is writing an article in connection
with Berdayev’s last article in Mir Bozhy.

I was very glad to learn that you and P. B. will be seeing
each other and will start on the programme. It will be a
tremendous step forward if we can come before our people
with a draft like yours and P. B.’s. This is a matter that
is most urgent.

All the very best.


Yours,


Petrov

October 21, 1901   

Dear G. V.,

A few days ago I sent you Neue Zeit No. 1, with
Engels’s article on the
programme.[4] I think you will find
it of some interest for your work, i.e., for drawing up the
draft programme. Then today we sent you proofs; when
you have read them, please send them directly to Dietz
marked
“Druckfertig”[1]

as soon as possible.

I have selected a little material for a review of home
affairs[2]

and in a few days’ time I shall tackle it in real
earnest (at the moment I am indisposed—-a touch of the
flu after my
trip[5]). Since after this work I shall have to
get busy with Iskra, and then with the pamphlet, which
I have been putting off for a long
time,[3]

I have no time
whatever left for the programme, and you are our only
hope.

Could you recommend some Frenchman for letters from
France? (Danevich will probably refuse.)

All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin

November 2   

Dear G. V.,

We have received your letter. We are planning to print
your article in Iskra No. 10. No. 9 will come out in a
few days; the delay is due to its having swelled to eight
pages.

Did you receive Nos. 1 and 3 of Neue Zeit (when you
have finished with them, please return them)? I sent them
to you because they contain articles by Engels and Kautsky
on the
programme,[3] which may, perhaps, be of use to
you. When do you expect to finish the programme?

You do not write anything about the review of the
collected writings of
Marx.[4] We take it that you will send
it all the same—it is absolutely necessary for Zarya No. 2-3.
Volume 4 will be published on November 4, containing
letters of Lassalle to Marx, but it is not worth while
writing a review of it now, so as not to delay publication.

I am finishing my review of home
affairs.[1]

Alexei has
written about Lübeck. We have reviews: yours on Frank,
three by Alexei+yours on the collected writings of Marx+
perhaps Velika Dmitrievna’s on
Svoboda.[5] This will
be enough.

Also,[2]
Zarya No. 2-3 is ready and it is only a matter
of the printing, which could be completed by the middle
of November.

All the best.


Yours...
 

P.S. I ask about the programme so insistently because
we have to know whether, immediately after Zarya No. 2-3
has come out, there will be material for No. 4 to be given
to the compositors. Dietz is pressing me about this.

If Ryazanov’s article has not yet been sent—send it
immediately, otherwise he will positively tear Alexei to
pieces. Ryazanov (and Parvus with him) has been mortally
offended by the postponement of his article and wants,
it seems, to take leave of us. “You don’t know your job
as editors!”, Parvus said to us.

How do you like that?

1)  Yakov

2)  The Moscow Committee

3)  St.  Petersburg+Nizhni

4)  Bakunin?

5) “A Letter to the Russian Social-Democratic
Press”.[1]

We have just learnt that the Unionists are arranging
a conference of the leading committees to decide the
question of the conflict
abroad.[2]

Every effort must be made to secure the adoption of the
following measures by the largest possible number of
committees and groups:

1) The conference must unfailingly be postponed at least
until the spring (until Easter or thereabouts). Reasons:
a) It is essential to have delegates both from Iskra and
from the League abroad, and this requires time and money.
A conference without delegates from Iskra and the League
is invalid and senseless, b) It is essential to wait for the
publication of the pamphlets of both sides giving the gist
of the disagreements. Until these pamphlets come out the
conference cannot have the knowledge needed for
judgement and so its deliberations would be hanging in the air.
Iskra No. 12 (appearing December 5, 1901) definitely
promises that this pamphlet will be issued very shortly (in
about a month and a half). All the disagreements will be
analysed there in great detail. We shall show there how
pernicious the Rabocheye Dyelo trend is, and reveal all
their disgraceful vacillation and impotence in the face of
Bernsteinism and Economism. This pamphlet is nearly
ready and is rapidly approaching completion. Further, at the
present time (mid-December, new style) reports on the

    

disagreements are being delivered abroad: one by a
representative of Rabocheye Dyelo, another by a representative
of the League. These reports too will very soon appear in
print, and to call a conference before they appear is just
a waste of money and a needless sacrifice.

2) We shall send a special representative to the
conference, if it does take place. Hence it is imperative that we
should be informed immediately (1) whether the conference
has been fixed; (2) where; (3) when; and (4) the pass-word
and rendezvous for the conference. The committees and
groups must be formally requested to communicate this
information on pain of the conference being declared
invalid and of immediate publication of the fact that there
is a desire to decide matters without having heard both
sides.

3) If the committees or groups elect to the conference
representatives with a bias in favour of Rabocheye Dyelo,
it is essential to protest against this immediately and
formally, and to demand representatives from both Rabocheye
Dyelo and Iskra supporters (from the Majority and the
Minority respectively).

4) In the event of the conference declaring against Iskra,
it will be necessary to withdraw from committees and groups
which do not agree to protest publicly against this—to
withdraw and at once publish the fact in Iskra and give
the reasons for it. Our people must begin right now to
make arrangements for such a step.

5) We must be informed at once of the result, and kept
informed immediately of all steps taken. Every effort should
be made to ensure that Iskra supporters everywhere reach
agreement and act in unison.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The five points indicate where this letter was to be sent. Point 4 refers
to the Tver Social-Democratic organisation, the letter for which was
forwarded to the address of A. Bakunin. Point 5, given in quotes, is the
title of a letter received from an Iskra representative in
Russia. This letter was published by Lenin in full in his article “A
Talk with Defenders of Economism” (see Vol. 5 of this edition). Under
this point Lenin meant the Iskra representative from whom the
letter had been received. p. 90




[2]
By the “conflict abroad” Lenin meant the incident at the
“unity” conference of R.S.D.L.P.’s organisations abroad,
when the members of Iskra, Zarya and
Sotsial-Demokrat walked out. p. 90

We have received information that Akim is printing
Vperyod.[2] We refuse to believe it and request you to
ascertain whether this is not a misunderstanding. That
people who have been collecting hundreds and thousands
of rubles on behalf of Iskra, for the Iskra print-shop—
people who represent the Iskra organisation in Russia—
should go over secretly to another undertaking and that
at a critical moment for us, when shipments have come
to a stand, when the entire North and Centre (and the
South too!) have flooded us with complaints at the absence
of Iskra, and when the only hope was to have it reproduced
in Russia, that people should have done this in such an
underhand way, for Akim wrote us that he was printing
No. 10 and we were so sure of it, while Handsome did not
tell us a word about his magnificent plans—such behaviour,
which violates not only all rules of the organisation, but
also certain simpler rules, is simply unbelievable.

If this incredible news is true, we demand an immediate
meeting to deal with this unprecedented depravity and,
for our part, we earnestly request Yakov and Orsha to
scrape together whatever money they can and immediately
carry out their plan of coming here.

Do you consider it essential that the existence of an
Iskra print-shop in Russia be kept secret? That is to say:
are you against our widely showing the Russian copy
abroad?[3]

As regards the general maladjustment of our affairs, of
which, according to the person who has recently seen
you,[4]
you so bitterly complain, we can be of little assistance.
The Russian members of the Iskra organisation should
form a solid core and achieve a proper distribution of Iskra
throughout Russia. That is wholly a matter for the Russian
organisation. If we achieve it, success is assured. But
without it, maladjustment is
inevitable.[1]

For the sake of
proper distribution and prestige it would be extremely
important to print Iskra in Russia, every third or fourth
issue, choosing one of more permanent interest. Perhaps
No. 13,[5] for example, should be chosen.

But once you do print, print a much larger number of
copies; we should try at least once to satiate the whole
of Russia. Do you remember how you yourself complained
of the small circulation?

Once again, best regards and congratulations on your
success!

Goldman, L. I. (1877-1939)—joined the revolutionary movement
in 1893. In 1900 went abroad, where he joined the Iskra
organisation. In May 1901 organised an illegal printing-press in Kishinev,
where Iskra and other Social-Democratic publications were
printed. Was arrested in 1902 and escaped from exile in 1905; was secretary
of the Menshevik Iskra editorial board.


After the October Socialist Revolution he worked as business executive and
engaged in publishing activities. p. 93




[3]
An Iskra illegal printing-press, organised at Kishinev, printed
various issues of the newspaper for distribution in Russia. Lenin’s
letter refers to the report about the Kishinev press having printed issue
No. 10 of Iskra. p. 93




[4]
This apparently refers to I. B. Basovsky, who organised a dispatch office
in Kiev in August 1901 to handle Iskra literature arriving from
abroad; this office also distributed all the literature printed in
Kishinev. p. 93

Iskra No. 13 for December 20, 1901, featured
Lenin’s article “Demonstrations Have Begun” (see Vol. 5
of this edition). p. 93

February 7, 1902   

Dear G. V.,

I am sending you the draft programme with Berg’s
amendments. Please write whether you will insert the
amendments or present a complete counterdraft. I should
like to know also which passages you have found
unsatisfactory.

Regarding religion, in a letter of Karl Marx on the Gotha
Programme I read a sharp criticism of the demand for
Gewissensfreiheit[1]

and a statement that Social-Democrats
ought to speak out plainly about their fight against
religiösem
Spuk.[2]
[5]

Do you consider such a thing possible
and in what form? In the matter of religion we are less
concerned about cautiousness than the Germans, as is the
case, too, in regard to the “republic”.

Will you please let Koltsov copy from your copy; it will
not take much time.

How is your work going (if you are writing an article
for Zarya, as we assume)? When do you think you will
finish it?

You have still not sent me Neue Zeit (Nos. 1 and 3) and
the letter on the agrarian programme! Please send them or
write why there has been this delay.

I have ordered
Conrad’s Jahrbücher[6] for 1902 for you.
Wirtschaftliche Chronik for 1901 will come out in
February—it will be sent to you then. Have you subscribed to
Torgovo-Promyshlennaya
Gazeta[7] and have you already
begun to receive it?
 

Have you heard anything more about the Rabocheye
Dyelo people? We haven’t heard a thing.

My pamphlet is being set
up.[3]


Vorwärts has refused to publish even a condensed reply
and the matter has gone to the

Vorstand.[4]

It is said that
Bebel is on our side. We shall see.

All the very best.


Yours,


Frey

April 4, 1902 

Dear G. V.,

I am sending you my article on the cut-off
lands.[1]

When
you have read it, please send it to P. B. together with
this letter, for if you keep to the plan which I originally
supported (viz., that this article should be, so to speak, a
general defence of our general draft), we must agree
jointly on any necessary corrections. If, however, you reject
this plan, then we shall have to make other arrangements.

In some places I have quoted the general part of the
programme (the statement of principle) according to my
draft; this will be altered, of course, if my draft is
rejected, (I could then make some quotations from the Erfurt
Programme,[4] if you had no objections.)

Velika Dmitrievna made some marginal comments
without, however, suggesting definite changes in each
particular case. Please write and give me your opinion on
these points. On one of them, I should like to say a few
words in my own defence. Velika Dmitrievna suggests
deleting pages
79–82[2]

;

I, of course, would not go out of
my way to defend them. But she has also discovered in
them the programme’s “encouragement of unfairness” in
proposing not to give preference to small leaseholders
(of nationalised land) but leasing to big and small alike
on condition of fulfilment of the agrarian laws and (N.B.)
proper cultivation of the land and livestock management.
 

She argues: this will be a “crime”, for “the rich will grab
everything”, while improved cultivation will deprive of work
nine-tenths of the workers whom no agrarian laws will help.

I think this argument is incorrect, for (1) it presumes
a very highly developed bourgeois society in which it is
a rare peasant who can manage without wage-labour;
(2) the “rich” can then obtain land only if large-scale
farming is technically and economically “well organised”,
but this cannot be done all at once, hence the sudden
transition that frightens Velika Dmitrievna cannot happen;
(3) the ousting of workers by machines is, of course, the
inevitable result of large-scale production, but we are
pinning our hopes not on retarding the development of
capitalist contradictions, but on their full development;
moreover, improved cultivation of the soil presupposes
a gigantic growth of industry and intensified efflux of
population from the land; (4) the proposed measure will
not only not help any “criminals” but, on the contrary,
is the sole conceivable measure in bourgeois society for
counteracting “crime”, for it directly restricts not only
exploitation of the worker, but also plunder of the land
and deterioration of livestock. It is precisely the petty
producer in bourgeois society who especially squanders
the forces not only of people, but of the land and livestock.

If you, too, are in favour of deleting pp. 79–82, please give your
advice on how to alter the note on
p. 92.[3]


What is your opinion as to whether it is possible in
general to publish the agrarian part of the programme (and
the commentaries on it) separately from the programme as
a whole, prior to the publication of the whole programme?

I received yesterday the proofs of V. I.’s article and
sent them to Dietz. Yesterday I sent to your address the
continuation of the proofs of her article. (To speed things
up she could send the corrected proofs directly to Dietz.)

It is now three weeks since we last heard of poor Tsvetov.
He has probably gone under. It will be a great loss to us!

All the very best.


Yours,


Frey
 

April 5. P.S. I have just received your letter. I have
passed it on to our people. We shall answer in a few days.

Please send Berg’s draft (which you call commissional)[5]
immediately to this address: Frau Kiroff, Schraudolfstrasse,
29, III. 1. bei Taurer. This is very urgent, for they have
no copy and do not understand your comments. (Personally,
I would have preferred publication of both drafts, in the
form of the “third way” proposed by everyone, but the
majority) apparently, is now of a different mind.) I shall
send you the agrarian books. Velika Dmitrievna, it seems,
is ready to soften her “detraction” of the legal Marxists.

May 3, 1902


Dear P. B.,


The other day I sent you a “letter for
K.”,[1]

without
adding a single line from me as I was extremely busy.
I hope you will forgive me?


I should like to have a few words with you now about
the article on the cut-off
lands.[2]

I corrected it, taking
into account all the suggestions and demands of the high
collegium. Now it is being sent to G. V. to be forwarded
on to you: don’t forget to ask him for it should he delay
it (Dietz’s printing-press is standing idle!). Berg is satisfied with my corrections, but he has informed me that the
strongest objections to the article came from you. If it does
not disturb your work too much—please write and tell me
the cause of your dissatisfaction. I am very interested in
this. (If you are writing an article, please don’t drop it
for my sake, as this conversation is not a “business” one,
but largely post festum.)


I find it difficult, for instance, to understand your insertion
“... the heavy oppression to which the peasantry is
subjected...” (of the survivals of serfdom). Firstly, it is
superfluous, as it adds nothing to the thought. Secondly,
it is inaccurate (it is not only the peasantry that they
heavily oppress; moreover their harmfulness does not lie
only in the “oppression” of one or other social stratum).


The programme has already been sent for copying and
will appear as the leading article in Iskra No. 21. The

    

question whether or not I should write a criticism (per mated by the high
collegium) I have not yet decided, for I want to read the programme in
print over and over again “at leisure”, and at present I have not
yet fully recovered from the stunning effect of
London.[3]


How are L. Gr. and Boris Nikolayevich? How is the former’s work
progressing? And how is the health of the latter? We are counting on him
very shortly (most probably), and may he, therefore, recover fully and
quickly.


With warm greetings and best wishes for your health,


Yours...


P.S. Inform B. N. that in Voronezh about 40 people have been arrested (it is
said), and a letter received today gives the names: “Karpov, Lyubimov,
Korostenev, Kardashev, Butkovsky, Makhnovets and Gubareva, the last four were
released without being interrogated. In Uf a there have been eight raids and two
arrests: Boikov and Sazonov, students.” The Voronezh people were arrested
(April 1) apparently “on orders from St. Petersburg—Kiev”
(sic!). That is the entire content of one direct letter to us.


In general, there have been arrests galore! It is almost certain that
those arrested include our Nadezha, whom you saw and recognised both in Zurich
and among us—yes, yes, the very same! It’s a very bad business!


N.B. Get L. Gr. to send immediately the issue you received of
Pridneprovsky
Krai[4] containing blank spaces.

May 6


We received the letter. Wood, apparently, has been taken. It is essential that
Claire should save himself and therefore should go underground without
delay. The meeting with
Sasha[3] (Wood managed to write to us about
it) led to the appointment of a committee for convening a congress in five
months’ time.


Our main task now is to prepare for it, i.e., to ensure that our own
reliable people penetrate into the largest possible number of
committees and try to undermine the Southern Central Committee of the southern
committees (=whirligig). This “whirligig”, which is manipulated by a
Genosse (someone has even accused him of being an agent provocateur,
but that has not been verified yet), is the main obstacle
(besides St. Petersburg). Hence the immediate task—that both Kurtz and
Embryon join the committees at once. Next, that their example in one form or
another is followed by Claire and Brodyagin. This is the main task, for
otherwise we shall inevitably be ousted; subordinate everything else to this
task, bear in mind the major significance of the Second Congress!
Adapt...[1]

to
this end and think about an attack on the centre, Ivanovo and others, the Urals
and the South. The formal aspect is now acquiring special significance.


Brodyagin suspects provocation. There cannot be any here, we are already in
London. It is very likely that many threads have been picked up from some of our
arrested

    

people—that explains everything. Look after yourself as you would the
apple of your eye—for the sake of the “main
task”.[4] If we (i.e., you) do not cope with
it—it will be a great calamity.


Forward this letter to Brodyagin immediately and tell him to write to us without
fail and more frequently; all his letters have arrived safely.


If it is confirmed that Wood has gone under, we must meet Claire or Brodyagin as
soon as possible or correspond in great detail, if there are good addresses
(?) for sending you all the details about Sasha (send
an address for the bookbinding as quickly as possible).


Arrange the passport yourself, do not rely on us. Shouldn’t Claire and
Brodyagin change passports, since the former is already known to everyone?


Who will be the delegate from Moscow? Is he absolutely reliable? Has he a good
successor? And so: again and again: join the committees. Is Nizhni reliable?

I have received the article with your
comments.[1]

You have fine ideas of tact
towards editorial colleagues! You do not even shrink from choosing the most
contemptuous expressions, not to mention “voting” proposals which
you have not taken the trouble to formulate, and even “voting” on
style. I should like to know what you would say, if I were to answer your
article on the programme in a similar manner? If you have set yourself the aim
of making our common work impossible, you can very quickly attain this aim by
the path you have chosen. As far as personal and not business relations are
concerned, you have already definitely spoilt them or, rather, you have
succeeded in rutting an end to them completely.

June 23, 1902


Dear G. V.,


A great weight fell from my shoulders when I received your
letter, which put an end to thoughts of “internecine
war”. The more this last seemed inevitable the greater the gloom such
thoughts aroused, since the consequences for the Party would be most
unfortunate....


I shall be very glad, when we meet, to have a talk with you about the beginning
of the “affair” in
Munich,[2] not, of course, to rehash
the past, but to discover for myself what it was that offended
you at the time. That I had no intention of offending you, you are of course
aware.


V. I. has shown me also your letter about the article, i.e., your proposal to be
given an opportunity of expressing your opinion in your programmatic
article. Personally, I am inclined to consider such a decision the best and I
think that the possibility of registering a 25 per cent difference (if it has to
be registered at all) has always existed for each of the co-editors (just as you
have already mentioned a somewhat different formulation of the question of
nationalisation in the same article—or of the liberals in the review in
Zarya No. 2–3). I am ready now, of course, to discuss with you once
again desirable alterations in my
article[1]

and I shall send you the proofs for
this purpose. Select anything you like. We ought to finish Zarya as quickly
as possible; as it is the negotiations are dragging out terribly. In any
case. I shall at once inform both
A. N. and Julius of your proposal.

 

I have not yet received the proofs of your article and so cannot answer your
question about the passage on Marx.


The letter of a
Socialist-Revolutionary,[3] in my opinion, is hardly
worth publishing; they have their own press—let them polemise there (for
that’s what it is with them—sheer polemics). About Belgium, it would
be good to publish Rosa Luxemburg’s article, if this could be done
quickly.


All the very best.


N. Lenin


P.S. In a day or two I am going to Germany to see my mother and take a
holiday.[4] My nerves are worn to shreds and I am feeling quite
ill. I hope we shall soon meet in London?


 
Notes
 

[1]

 “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” (see present
edition, Vol. 6).—Ed.

 



[2]
Lenin refers to the beginning of the disagreements in connection with the
drafting of the Party programme, the first discussion

   







of which took place at a meeting of the Iskra editorial board in
Munich on January 21, 1902. At this meeting Lenin sharply criticized the
first draft of the programme drawn up by Plekhanov and submitted his own
amendments and proposals. p. 104




[3]
Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.R.s)—a petty-bourgeois party in
Russia, formed at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902 through the
amalgamation of various Narodnik groups and circles. The S.R.s saw no class
distinctions between the proletariat and the peasantry, glossed over the
class differentiation and antagonism within the peasantry and denied the
leading role of the proletariat in the revolution. The tactics of
individual terrorism which the S.R.s advocated as the principal method of
fighting the autocracy caused great harm to the revolutionary movement and
made it difficult to organise the masses for revolutionary struggle.


The agrarian programme of the S.R.s envisaged the abolition of private
ownership of the land and its transfer to the village communes on the basis
of equalised tenure, as well as the development of all forms of
co-operation. There was nothing socialistic in this programme, which the
S.R.s sought to present as a programme for “socialising the
land”, since abolition of private ownership of the land alone, Lenin
pointed out, cannot abolish the poverty of the masses.


The Bolsheviks exposed the S.R.s’ attempts to pose as socialists,
fought hard with them for influence over the peasantry and showed how
harmful their tactics of individual terrorism were to the working-class
movement. At the same time, they were prepared, on certain conditions, to
make temporary agreements with the S.R.s in the struggle against tsarism.


The absence of class homogeneousness among the peasantry was responsible
for the political and ideological instability and the organisational
confusion in the S.R. party, and for its constant vacillation between the
liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. There had been a split in the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party during the first Russian revolution, its
Right wing forming the legal Trudovik Popular Socialist Party, which held
views close to those of the Cadets, and the Left wing taking shape as the
semi-anarchist league of Maximalists. During the years of reaction
(1907-10) the S.R. party suffered a complete ideological and organisational
break-down, and the First World War found most of the S.R.s taking a
social-chauvinist stand.


After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1917
the S.R.s, together with the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of
the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government of the bourgeoisie and
landowners (the party’s leaders Kerensky, Avksentyev and Chernov were
members of that government). The Left wing of the S.R.s founded an
independent party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries at the end of November
1917. In an effort to maintain their influence among the peasant masses,
the Left S.R.s formally recognised the Soviet

   

power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but shortly
afterwards turned against the Soviet power.


During the foreign military intervention and civil war the S.R.s carried on
subversive counter-revolutionary activities, strongly supported the
interventionists and whiteguards, took part in counter-revolutionary plots,

activity against the Soviet state. p. 105

Dear L.,


My sister’s address is: Mme Elizaroff. Loguivy (par
Ploubazianec), Côtes du Nord. Anya and Mother really do not like it here very
much and they may go to some other place—they don’t know where yet
(you can address your letter Expédition). I am going home tomorrow. I
liked it here very much on the whole and have had a good rest, only
unfortunately I was a bit premature in imagining myself well again, forgot about
dieting and now am again having trouble with catarrh. Well, all that is of no
consequence.


Are you going to stay long in that country of yours? It would be a good thing if
you were to combine the pleasant with the useful (your job) and take a good long
holiday. Drop me a line about yourself when you return.


How do you like the result of the negotiations with L. Gr. and Yuriev? Did you
reach full agreement and do you now hope for better results?


There is good news from Russia of the committees making a turn towards
Iskra, even that of St. Petersburg (sic!). Here Is a curious
little example. They sent a pamphlet to Rabocheye Dyelo. There is a
note there (on p. 9—we have been told exactly!) reading: “See
Lenin’s excellent
book.”[1]

The Unionists here raised the alarm, and wrote
to St. Peters burg: be so good as to delete it, you are hitting both your self
and us by it. Reply: don’t hinder us from putting matters on a new
footing, but give the pamphlet to Iskra.

 

This is entre nous, of course, for the time being. But it is
characteristic!


I don’t know whether St. Petersburg will maintain its
new position.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin


Write to me in London.


P.S. I almost forgot. Socialiste notified me that my subscription
expired in December 1901. Is that so? Haven’t they made a mistake? I
remember your going there once with Yurdanov’s card. Didn’t you keep
some document, or do you remember without it?

August 2,1902


Dear Ch.,


I received your letter, and I reply, to start with, in a couple of words: I
don’t feel at all well, I am all done up.


On the point you have raised, I have not seen a single
letter. I think you are under a misapprehension. Who could think of
“unorganising” the workers’ circles, groups and organisations
instead of increasing and strengthening them? You write that I have not
indicated how a strictly secret organisation can have contact with the mass of
workers. That is hardly the case, for (although that is vient sans
dire) you yourself quote the passage on p. 96 concerning the need
“in as large a number as possible (Lenin’s italics) and
with the widest variety of functions” for “a large number (N.B.!) [
a large number!] I of other organisations” (i.e., besides the
central organisation of professional
revolutionaries).[1]

But you are wrong in
finding an absolute antithesis where I have merely established a
gradation and marked the limits of the extreme links of this gradation. For a
whole chain of links occurs, beginning from the handful making up the
highly secret and close-knit core of professional revolutionaries (the centre)
and ending with the mass “organisation without members”. I
point out merely the trend in the changing character of the links: the
greater the “mass” character of the organisation, the less
definitely organised and the less secret should it be—that is my
thesis. And you want to understand this as meaning that there
is no need for intermediaries between the mass and the revolutionaries! Why,
the whole essence lies in these intermediaries! And since I point out the
characteristics of the extreme links and stress (and I do stress) the
need for intermediate links, it is obvious that the latter will have their place
between the “organisation of revolutionaries” and the
“mass organisation”—

    

between as regards the type of their structure, i.e., they will be less
narrow and less secret than the centre, but more so than a “weavers”
union”, and so forth. In a “factory circle” (needless to
say, we must aim at having a circle of intermediaries in each factory), for
example, it is essential to find a “middle” course: on the one hand,
the whole, or almost the whole, factory must inevitably know such and
such a leading worker, trust him and obey him; on the other hand, the
“circle” should arrange things so that all its members
cannot be identified, so that the one in closest contact with the mass
cannot be caught red-handed, cannot be exposed at all. Doesn’t
that follow logically from what is said in Lenin’s book?


The ideal of a “factory circle” is quite clear: four or five (I am
speaking by way of example) revolutionary workers—they must not
all be known to the mass. One member, probably, must be known, and he
needs to be protected from exposure; let it be said of him: he is one of us, a
clever chap, although he does not take part in the revolution (not
visibly). One member maintains contact with the centre. Each of them has an
alternate member. They conduct several circles (trade-union,
educational, distribution, spy—catching, arming, etc., etc.), the degree
of secrecy, naturally, of a circle for catching spies, for example, or for
procuring arms, being quite different from that of one devoted to the reading of
Iskra or the reading of legal literature, and so on and so forth. The
degree of secrecy will be inversely proportional to the number of members of the
circle and directly proportional to the remoteness of the circle’s aims
from the immediate struggle.


I do not know whether it is worth while writing specially about this: if you
think it is, return this letter to me together with yours, as material, and I
shall think it over. I hope to meet the St. Petersburg comrade here and talk
things over with him in detail.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin

August 4, 1902


Dear B. N.,


I received both your letters and was very glad to see from them that the
imaginary “misunderstandings” are really just smoke, as I
already said in writing to Cook (I wrote that I was convinced of this).


You complain of our “agents”. I want to talk this over with
you—it is such a painful subject with me too, “Agents have been
recruited too lightly.” I know it, I know it only too well, I never forget
it, but that is just the tragedy of our situation (believe me, tragedy is none
too strong a word!)—that we are obliged to act in this way, that
we are powerless to overcome the Jack of management prevailing in our
affairs. I am well aware that your words contained no reproach to us. But try to
put yourself in our place and adopt such an attitude as to make you say
not “your agents” but “our agents”. You could,
and in my opinion should, adopt such an attitude—and only then will
all possibility of misunderstandings have been removed once for
all. Substitute the first person for the second, keep an eye yourself on
“our” agents, help to search for, change and replace them, and then you
will speak not of our agents being “unpleasant” (such language is
bound to be misunderstood:
it is regarded as an expression of estrangement, it is regard ed as such in
general and by the members of our editorial collegium who have not had an
opportunity of clearing up the question with you), but of the shortcomings of
our common cause. The mass of these shortcomings weighs more and more
heavily upon my mind as time goes on. The time is now fast approaching (I feel
it) when tho question will face us squarely: either Russia will appoint its

    

people, put forward people who will come to our aid and set matters right,
or.... And although I know and see that such people are being put forward and
that their number is growing, this is taking place so slowly and with such
interruptions, and the “creaking” of the machinery is so
nerve-racking, that ... sometimes it becomes extremely
painful.


“Agents have been recruited too lightly.” Yes, but after all we
don’t make the “human material”, we take and have to take
what we are given. We couldn’t live without
it. A man is going to Russia—“I want to work for
Iskra,” he says. He is an honest man, devoted to the cause. Well, he
goes, of course, and passes for an “agent”, although none
of us had ever handed out such a title. And what means have we for checking
“agents”, guiding them or appointing them to other places? More
often than not we can’t even get letters, and in nine cases out of
ten (I speak from experience) all our plans in regard to the future activity of the “agent” end in smoke as soon as the frontier is
crossed, and the agent muddles along just anyhow. Believe me, I am
literally losing all faith in routes, plans, etc., made here, because I know
beforehand that nothing will come of it all. We “have
to” make frantic efforts doing (for lack of suitable people)
other people’s jobs. In order to appoint agents, to look after them, to
answer for them, to unite and guide them in practice—it
is necessary to be everywhere, to rush about, to see all of them on the job, at
work. This requires a team of practical organisers and leaders, but we
haven’t got any; at least, very, very few to speak of.... That’s the
whole trouble. Looking at our practical mismanagement is often so infuriating
that it robs one of the capacity for work; the only consolation
is that it must be a vital cause if it is
growing—and obviously it
is—despite all this chaos. That means when the ferment
is over we shall have good wine.


Now do you understand why the mere remark by an Iskrist: “those agents of
’yours’ are rather lightweight” can almost drive us to distraction? Try
taking the place of these “lightweights” yourselves instead, we feel
like saying. We keep repeating and even writing in our booklets that the whole
trouble is that “there are plenty of people

    

and there are no people”, yet we have this lack of people thrust
under our nose. There is only one way out, only one solution that is most
imperatively necessary, urgent in the most literal, unexaggerated sense of
the word—for time will not wait and our enemies are growing too, including
Osvobozhdeniye[3]and the Socialist-Revolutionaries and all
the various new Social-Democratic groups, beginning with the lightheads of
Zhizn and ending with the
Borbist[4] intriguers. The
solution is for the Iskrists in Russia to get together at last, find the
people and take the management of “Iskra” into their own
hands, for truly it is said: our land is great and abundant, but disorder
reigns in it. People must be found, for there are people, but
they must be guard ed more carefully than the apple of one’s eye, not
merely in the direct sense of guarding from the police, but guarded for this
urgent matter, without allowing them to be divert ed by other, generally useful
but untimely tasks. When, owing to a complete lack of people, we are
compelled to seize on the most “lightweight”, it is not
surprising that we cannot stand by calmly watching others postponing our work
“for later on”.


If all the present, available supporters of Iskra were at
once, without delaying, to take up the management of
Iskra, its independent equipment with the means for sending
across the frontier, its distribution, and supply of material, etc., we
would have already an actual Central Committee, a C.C. disposing de
facto of “agents” (for the C.C. and not the editorial board
should dispose of the agents) and managing all practical matters.


It is being said: if there are no people, where is the C.C. to get them? But we
do find the people, even if only light weights. One heavyweight among ten
lightweights does not take the lead, but the experience will not have been
wasted. People learn in the course of the work: some drop out, others replace
them, and once things have been set going it is ten times easier for
the others to take up this work which has been running smoothly. If we
were to set up a C.C. today (not formally), tomorrow it would be formal and
would already be drawing capable people from every local organisation
ten times more energetically than now. And it is only this “drawing from
the local organisations”

    

that can create a state of affairs under which these local organisations would
be properly served.


That is why I am so jealous, so devilishly jealous about
Semyon
Semyonich[5] and why the glance (the mere glance) at
an “outsider” worries me. I can’t adopt any other attitude,
for unless the Iskrists say: this is my business,
unless they say it out loud, unless they come to grips with the job,
tackle it tooth and nail, unless they begin to upbraid the others for lack of
tenacity [you once said to me: upbraid the Iskrists! And I replied: it is not I
but you should do so, for only one who takes part practically in the
work itself and who knows it thoroughly has the right to do so]—
unless the Iskrists do this, it means that they want to leave us
“only with lightweights”, and that would be the beginning of the
end.


It is time to conclude. I am extremely desirous that you and Cook should have as
concrete an idea as possible of our position, understand it and say not you, but
we. In any case, it is essential that Cook should
write to us frequently, and directly, and keep us in closer
touch with Semyon Semyonich and the latter with us.


As to your visit here, if you still have to be in Zurich, that is a different
matter. Why are you feeling bad? Is your health quite all right? Should you not
take a little rest?


I am still unwell, so it is no use even thinking of a journey.


Write me your opinion of Zernova and Sanin. I have heard something about the
latter from various persons and got the impression that he is no worker, that he
is much too
“wild”.[1]

Is it true that Zernova is a bad person, that is,
not merely in the sense of being fond of “adventure” (that, in
itself, is not so bad) but as being unreliable?


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin.

Party’s draft programme was discussed. In 1902-03 organised the
transportation of illegal Social-Democratic literature to Russia and took
part in organising the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. At the Second

and expounded the ideas of moderate-monarchist

linked with Iskra and supported the latter’s political line
and plan of organisation.


After the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L P. the Northern Labour League was
reconstituted as the Northern Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the local
committees becoming groups of the Northern Committee. At the conference of
Northern organisations of the R.S.D.L.P. held in Kostroma in July 1905 the
Northern Committee was liquidated and separate committees were formed in
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Yaroslavl and Kostroma. p. 113

Dear comrades,


We were extremely glad to receive your letter informing us of the views and
plans of the remaining editors of Yuzhny
Rabochy.[3] We
whole-heartedly welcome your proposal for the closest contact and co-operation
between Yuzhny Rabochy and Iskra. The most vigorous steps
should immediately be taken to consolidate these close relations and pass to
united activities resulting from the unity of our views. In the first
place, we shall avail ourselves for this purpose of your proposal to negotiate
with
Chernyshev.[4] Let us have his address. Is he going to be abroad (as we
have heard) and will he not visit
us?[1]

Secondly, let us know also who your
official representative is. Give us at once a direct address for letters to you
from abroad and from Russia, as well as a rendezvous address to
you. We have already taken steps for members of the Iskra organisation
in Russia to meet you and confer about everything in detail. Nob to waste time,
we ask you, too, to write to us about matters in greater detail. What are the
immediate practical plans of the editorial board of Yuzhny Rabochy? Is
it in contact with the southern committees and does it have formal relations
with them? From your statement that you intend to conduct affairs as they were
conducted prior to the formation of the League of Southern Committees
and
Organisations[5] we infer that both the composition and
trend of the present editorial board of Yuzhny Rabochy differ
from the composition and trend which existed in the spring, at the

    

time of the conference. What exactly is the difference between these trends,
and what is the position adopted here by the southern committees, i.e., which of
them support the trend of the League of Southern Committees and Organisations
and which of them are in favour of your trend? What is your opinion of the
extent of this divergence, does it prevent Party unity, and what measures are
desirable for speedy achievement of solidarity? In what relation do the six
provincial groups you have written about stand to the southern committees (and
to the two trends which you have mentioned)? We should very much like you to
help us to clear up fully all these questions, for that would be of great
assistance in bringing closer together your friends and the members of the
Iskra organisation in Russia working in the south.

From abroad, write to Dietz in two envelopes, asking him
to forward immediately to the editorial board of Iskra.

Levin, E. Y. (born 1873)—a Social-Democrat, one of the
leaders of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, a member of Yuzhny
Rabochy editorial board. At the Pskov meeting of the Organising
Committee for convening the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (November
1902) was elected a member of the O.C. At the Second Congress adopted a
centrist stand; after the Congress joined the Mensheviks. In September 1903
he was arrested and subsequently retired from political activity. p. 114




[3]
This refers to the members of the group and editorial board of the
newspaper Yuzhny Rabochy who remained at large after the mass
arrests in the spring of 1902. In August 1902 they entered into
negotiations with the editorial board of Iskra for joint work to
restore the unity of Russian Social-Democracy. The declaration of
solidarity with Iskra by members of the Yuzhny Rabochy
group (published in Iskra No. 27, for November 1, 1902 and in
Yuzhny Rabochy No. 10, for December 1902) was of great importance
in consolidating the ranks of Social-Democracy in Russia. In November 1902
the Yuzhny Rabochy group, together with the Iskra
organisation in Russia, the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. and
the Northern League of the R.S.D.L.P., took part in setting up the
Organising Committee for convening the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. and participated in its activities. p. 114

Chernyshev, I. V.—a Social-Democrat, wavering between the
Economists and Iskrists, member of the Yuzhny Rabochy group. In
August 1902 he went abroad, where he negotiated with the Iskra
editorial board for joint work in uniting the Party. In April 1903 joined
the Economists and declared himself an adherent of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad. p. 114




[5]
The League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the
R.S.D.L.P. was formed in December 1901 at a conference of
representatives of the Social-Democratic committees and organisations in
the South of Russia (Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, Odessa, Kharkov and
Kishinev) on the initiative of the Yuzhny Rabochy group. The
conference elected a Central Committee of the League and declared the
newspaper Yuzhny Rabochy to be its central organ. The
group’s attempt (in opposition to the Iskra plan of creating
in Russia a centralised Marxist party with the aid of an all-Russia
political newspaper) to restore the R.S.D.L.P. by setting up regional
Social-Democratic associations proved impracticable, and after the mass
police raids in the spring of 1902 the League disintegrated. p. 114

A personal letter to Vanya and Varvara Ivanovna. Please hand it
immediately to them alone.


The news of Bouncer’s “victory” has astounded
us.[2]
Was the departure of Kasyan and Hairpin really sufficient to deprive the
Iskrists of the ability to act? Bouncer’s protest could lead only to your
proposing to him to put it to the vote and at once declaring by a
majority, firstly, that on the substance of the question he is in an
insignificant minority; and, secondly, that his complaint of violation of the
Rules is ridiculous and petty-fogging (for, according to the Rules, the opinion
should be asked of all who were present in St. Petersburg and the matter not
deferred pending an inquiry of those who were absent).


If Bouncer raised (dared to raise) the question of dissociation, it was
imperative at once to adopt a majority decision for his expulsion from the
Union.


Obviously, Bouncer is brazenly heading “for war” and the Iskrists
will be eternally disgraced if they do not reply to this by the most resolute
and desperate war. Do not be afraid of any threats on the part of Bouncer, you
have nothing to fear from publicity, treat the matter immediately as a war
issue, as we have written above, and adopt the decisions proposed above as
speedily as possible. Even if Bouncer carries still others along with him (even
if only half or less than half of you are left) you should all the same
go the whole hog and demand Bouncer’s expulsion unconditionally, without
being the least afraid of a “split” in the Union.

 

You should also put an ultimatum to the workers too:
either a split in the Union and war, or a decisive condemnation of Bouncer by
the workers and his expulsion.


We, for our part, are writing at once to 2a3b. We are putting off the
publication of the St. Petersburg statement in
Iskra.[3]


We repeat: the question has now become a point of honour with the
Iskra people of St. Petersburg.... Of course, every thing you do now
must be done at a general meeting, to which Bouncer must be invited and minutes
of the decisions taken. Send us the minutes at once.

Krasnukha, V. P. (1868-1913)—a Social-Democrat, an Iskrist;
since 1899 worked in the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation; at
the beginning of April 1902 represented the St. Petersburg League of
Struggle at the Byelostok Conference. In November 1902 attended the Pskov
meeting of the Organising Committee for convening the Second Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. at which he was elected a member.


Stasova, Yelena Dmitrievna (born 1873)—veteran of the
revolutionary movement, member of the Bolshevik Party since 1898. In
1902-03 a member of the St. Petersburg Committee. From August 1905 to
January 1906 carried out Party assignments in Geneva. p. 116




[2]
Bouncer (Vyshibalo)—pseudonym of Tokarev, leader of the
St. Petersburg Economists. As a member of the St. Petersburg League of
Struggle, Tokarev protested against the July declaration of the
St. Petersburg Committee recognising Iskra and Zarya as
the leading organs of Russian Social-Democracy. He also demanded that the
representative of the Iskra Organisation be expelled from the
committee of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle. p. 116

This refers to the July declaration of the R.S.D.L.P.’s
St. Petersburg Committee announcing solidarity with the newspaper
Iskra and the journal Zarya and recognising them as the

Dear friend,


I cannot find my notes on our meeting
here.[2] In any case they are
not needed. The meeting was of a consultative nature and you
two,[3]
of course, remember what happened better than I do. I cannot reconstruct
officially what took place, and I could not do so even if I had the jottings
made exclusively for myself, sometimes not in words but by signs. If there is
anything important that needs to be settled, write a definite proposal, send in
an official inquiry to us (to the editorial board) and we shall answer at
once. But if there is no occasion for it yet—well, we have reached full
agreement on general tactics.


I was very, very glad to learn that you have rapidly gone forward in the matter
of the
O.C.[4] and set it up with six members. I am surprised only that you have
co-opted others before the formal constitution, before the
invitation of the Bund? Just the opposite was planned, wasn’t it?
Incidentally, this is not so important if you are sure that it will cause no
inconvenience.


Be stricter with the Bund! Be stricter, too, in writing to the Bund and
Rabocheye Dyelo abroad, reducing their function to such a minimum that
in any case it cannot be of importance. You can entrust technical arrangements
of the Congress to special delegates from you or to your special
agents; don’t hand over this matter to anyone and
don’t forget that the people abroad are weak in secrecy techniques.


Outline the congress ordre du jour only in general terms. Send us an
enquiry asking to be informed of our (editorial) ordre du jour, who are
our reporters and how many delegates

    

there may be from us (from the editorial board). Speed things up with the
Congress as much as you can.


Try to provide mandates for those who have fled from Russia; that will economise
expenses.


Be sure to inform us exactly of each and every official step taken by the
Organising Committee. And one thing more: Rabocheye Dyelo is dying and
it would be very valuable If you (on behalf of the Organising Committee) were to
send them an exhortation, in serious but not abusive terms, on the importance of
uniting, on the value of conciliation, and so forth.


And so, make haste! In case of need, we shall raise a little money.


 
Notes

Krasikov, Pyotr Ananievich (1870-1939)—professional
revolutionary, Bolshevik. Started his revolutionary activities in 1892 and
joined the Iskra organisation in 1900. At the Pskov meeting of the
Organising Committee for convening the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. (November 1902) he was elected a member of the O.C. At the
Second Congress (1903) joined the Bolsheviks. After the Congress took an
active part in the fight against the Mensheviks. In August 1904 attended
the meeting of the 22 Bolsheviks in Geneva. Took an active part in the
revolution of 1905-07. p. 118

This refers to the meeting of the Iskra editorial board with
representatives of the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the
Iskra organisation in Russia and the Northern League of the
R.S.D.L.P. held on August 15, 1902. At this meeting an Iskrist nucleus of
the Organising Committee for convening the Second Congress of the Party was
set up.

The Organising Committee (O.G.) for convening the Second Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P. was set up on Lenin’s initiative at a meeting of
S.D. committees in Pskov on November 2-3, 1902. The Iskrists formed a
preponderant majority on the new committee. P. A. Krasikov, F. V. Lengnik,
P. N. Lepeshinsky and G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, were co-opted to the O.C. on
behalf of the Iskra organisation in Russia, and A. M. Stopani on
behalf of the Northern League of the R.S.D.L.P.

Lenin writing. We are very glad to note the successes and energy of the O.C. It
is most important to exert every effort immediately to carry matters to a
conclusion and as quickly as possible. Try to replace speedily the member from
St. Petersburg (Ignat would be good) and write to us in detail about the
attitude adopted towards the Organising Committee in various places
(committees). Will Ignat see
Fyokla[2] soon? We need to know
precisely and speedily.


We have drawn up the list of questions approximately as follows (in the
order for their discussion):

1) attitude towards
Boris[3]? (If only a
federation, then we should part at once and sit separately. We need to prepare
everyone for this.)

2) The programme.

3) The Party Organ (the newspaper. A new
one or one of those already existing. Insist on the importance of this
preliminary question).

4) Organisation of the Party (basic principle: two
central institutions, unsubordinated to each other.

a) The Central
Organ—ideological leadership. Abroad?

b) The Central Committee—in
Russia. All practical direction. Regular and frequent meetings between them and
certain reciprocal membership rights or sometimes reciprocal co-optation. It
is extremely important to prepare the ground in advance for securing the
adoption of this basic principle and for making it fully clear to
everyone. Next, the greatest possible centralisation. Autonomy of the local
committees in local affairs—with the Central Committee having the right of
veto in exceptional cases. District organisations only with the consent and
endorsement of the Central Committee).

5) Various questions of tactics: terror, trade unions, legalisation of the
workers’ movement, strikes, demonstrations,

    

uprising, agrarian policy and work among the peasantry and in the army,
agitation in general; leaflets and pamphlets and so on and so forth;
here no special order has been adhered to.

6) Attitude to other parties (
Osvobozhdeniye, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Poles, Letts, etc.).

7)
Delegates’ reports (it is very important that there should be reports
from every committee, and as full as possible (they should he prepared
immediately and for safety’s sake copies should be given to the
Organising Committee to be sent to us). Try always to characterise the local
Socialist-Revolutionaries and give an estimate of their strength and
connections in the reports).

8) Groups and organisations abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo, Borba, Zhizn,
   Svoboda.[4] A committee or the Central Commit tee to he
   charged with working out a plan for their unification).

9) May Day.

10) The
   1903 Congress in
Amsterdam.[5] 11) Internal organisational
   questions: finance, the type of organisation of the committees, the C.C. to
   take charge of shipment and distribution of literature, etc. Some of these,
   probably, will have to be discussed in committees.


I repeat, this is merely a preliminary draft and only the order of items 1-5 has
been discussed here jointly. In this connection, among the members of the
editorial board I was in favour of item 3 being put in one of the first places
(i.e., in fact, third), but another member (Pakhomy) was for putting it after
item 5. I consider it important to settle item 3 at the outset so as at once to
give battle to all opponents on a fundamental and broad issue and to ascertain
the entire picture of the Congress (alternatively: to separate on an important
issue).


Find out whether you will have reporters and on what questions (ad
5—in detail).


What pamphlet does Ignat want published? Is it not the letter to
Yeryoma[1]

?


Be sure to obtain from each committee (and group) an official and
written reply as to whether they recognise the Organising Committee. It
is essential to have this at once.


I advise that the announcement about the Organising Committee should be issued
in Russia as well (i.e., not

    

only printed in Iskra); issue it even if only in hectographed form.


We shall send the general editorial draft of the questions and the list of our
reporters when we have made contact about this with all the members of the
editorial board who are living in various countries at present.


Appoint immediately members of the Organising Committee in the chief centres
(Kiev, Moscow, St. Petersburg), and give secret addresses for rendezvous with
them so that we can be sure that all those whom we send are under the full
disposal of the Organising Committee. This is very, very important.


Finally, one thing more: Ignat’s meeting with Fyokla must be arranged to
take place after 1) he has seen all and everyone he possibly can; 2)
you have received from every one official recognition of the Organising
Committee; 3) you have officially informed “Rabocheye Dyelo” as
well that they will have a plenipotentiary member of the Organising
Committee. Only under these conditions can the meeting of Ignat and Fyokla lead
to further important practical steps. Ignat should therefore make haste with
these preliminary measures and not forget that he should come to Fyokla’s
equipped with formally acknowledged and the widest (N.B.!) plenary
powers.


 
Notes

[4]
The Svoboda group, calling themselves the
“revolutionary-socialist” group, was founded by E. O. Zolensky
(Nadezhdin) in May 1901. Lenin described this group as one of those
“small and rootless groups” which “had no stable or
serious principles, programme, tactics, organisation, and no roots among
the masses” (see Vol. 20, pp. 356 and 357, of this edition). The
group published a journal Svoboda (Freedom) in Switzerland (two
numbers were issued: No. 1 in 1901 and No. 2 in 1902). The Svoboda
group advocated the ideas of terrorism and Economism, and in a bloc with
the St. Petersburg Economists came out against Iskra and the
St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. The group ceased to exist in
1903.





[5]
Lenin intended to enlist the services of A. Bogdanov (Rakhmetov) for work
on the newspaper Vperyod, the mouthpiece of the Bolsheviks, which
was being organised ^^(see Note 265)^^.

December 14, 1902


Dear G. V.,


There has been no news from you for quite a time and a lot of business and
questions have accumulated.


First of all, about articles for Iskra. For No. 30 (No. 29 will come
out tomorrow or the day after) we have Julius’s article “Autumnal
Summing-up”. One more article is essential. How about you?
Please let us know whether you are writing anything and when you are thinking of
sending it, and also about a feuilleton; it would be very good to have
in No. 30 the feuilleton you proposed against Tarasov’s
“little
page”.[2] I shall await your reply.


Next, about a pamphlet against the Socialist-Revolutionaries. L. Gr. told me
and wrote to you that it would be best if you undertook it, for you could give,
in addition to “dogmatic” criticism, the historical
parallel with the seventies. I fully agree with L. Gr. that such a
parallel is very, very important; but there is no use, of course, in my even
thinking about it. And in general I should be very glad if you would undertake
this pamphlet. I have little heart for it myself; besides, in addition to
current business, I am now faced with the task of preparing for lectures in
Paris (Julius tells me that they want to invite me there for three or four
lectures on the agrarian question). And so, absolutely everything points to the
pamphlet being your job—it is most definitely needed against the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who must be picked to pieces. in the most detailed
and thoroughgoing manner. They are awfully harmful to us and our cause. Do
write and tell us your decision.

 

L. Gr.’s answer to Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya[3] was published
in No. 29: you will receive it towards the end of the week—and you have
already seen the proofs.


I learnt today that you will be at the international conference in Brussels
(probably at the end of December or beginning of January[4]) and will
read a lecture there. I hope you will not fail to drop in on us. We are right
next door and the fare will be quite cheap during the holidays. And here,
firstly, your lecture is very badly needed, as there are many workers
here who are infected with anarchism (I discovered this when I delivered my
lecture on the Socialist-Revolutionaries, which did not interest our people
here[5]). You would certainly be able to influence them. Furthermore,
and this is the chief thing, we have a heap of important subjects to discuss,
especially as regards Russian affairs: the Organising Committee, after long
preparation, has at last been formed there and it can play a
tremendous role. It is of the highest importance that we should jointly
reply to a whole series of questions which it has already
addressed to us (questions concerning measures for uniting the Party,
the agenda, Tagesordnung, at the general congress, what reports there
will be from us, etc.—extremely important questions in general,
and now of particular significance). Write, please, as to when exactly the
conference in Brussels will be held, how long it will last and whether you will be
able to come here. Further, it may, perhaps, not be out of place if at this
conference you already make use in one way or another of the fact that the
Organising Committee has been set up. Write soon and we shall get in touch with
Russia: we may succeed even in getting some sort of statement or letter from
them addressed to you, if needed.


Do you see the
Zhiznites[6]? How is the “rapprochement”
with them progressing and what are the chances? And what about the Rabocheye
Dyelo people? You know, I believe it would be a good thing if they too took
part in your “Marxist circle” and if we began (informally) to come
closer to them. It is not worth while these days quarrelling with them, and
there is no reason to, as a matter of fact: by replacing Rabocheye
Dyelo by Krasnoye
Znamya[7] they have in effect adopted
our plan for “division of literary functions”, and

    

(apart from the silly “clairvoyant”) there is nothing harmful
in Martynov’s pamphlet Workers and Revolution.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin


As for the
Bulgarian,[1]

I am to blame. I’m sorry. I did not write because
there were no assignments to give, and it did not occur to me that you
would worry.

We have received Vlas’s letter. We shall give you what
help we can. We have long been aware of your plight and
have been thinking of assistance.


But you must immediately and without fail write us an accurate account of the
split in St. Petersburg. Answer the following points:
1) Was the Organisation
Committee (the summer one) elected by the League of
Struggle[2] alone
(=committee of intellectuals?) or by the Workers’
Organisation[3]
as well?
2) When exactly was it elected?
3) Is there a precise record of
its powers (i.e., what it was charged with doing)?
4) Wherein lay the
irregularity of its election, according to Bouncer and Co.?
5) Were there
delegates from the Workers’ Organisation (two?) in the Organisation Committee
and by whom were they elected?
6) From what has Bouncer been chucked
out—from the Organisation Committee or the Intellectuals’ Committee or
the Workers’ Organisation?
7) What Workers’ Organisation is it that now writes
its declarations? A new one? A reorganised one? when? how?
8) Why have you not
sent us the September leaflet of the Committee of the Workers’ Organisation?
9) Why have you not issued even a handwritten leaflet against them?—or
   sent us a counter-declaration? Not one of their moves should be left
   unanswered.
10) What is this C.C. like now? Is there still an Organisation
   Committee? Are there workers on your side? Why haven’t they formed a
   counter-organisation? Why don’t your workers protest against Bouncer
   workers and their committee?

 

Send us immediately new, absolutely unused places of
rendezvous for visitors. Do not give these (our) rendezvous
to anyone else. Seek out beforehand a flat to shelter one
person. Take special care to cover up traces of his contacts
with the old members (Heron and others), who are probably
 being shadowed.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lavrov, V. I.—a Social-Democrat, Iskrist; from November 1902
was stand-in to Y. D. Stasova on the St. Petersburg Committee in case of
her arrest. In 1903 was in charge of technical arrangements for the
St. Petersburg Committee; conducted correspondence with Iskra.

Re: Stasova, see Note 153.  __GLOSSARY_LINK_COMMENT__





[2]
This refers to the St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation
of the Working Class organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895. In December
1895 the tsarist government dealt the League a severe blow by arresting a
considerable number of its leading members, Lenin included. The long
absence of the League’s founders, who were exiled to Siberia,
facilitated the prosecution of an opportunist policy on the part of the
“young” members and the Economists, who, from 1897, through the
newspaper Rabochaya Mysl, implanted on Russian soil the ideas of
trade-unionism and Bernsteinism. In the second half of 1898 control of the
League passed to the most outspoken of the Economists-the Rabochaya
Mysl adherents. The old surviving members of the League took part in
preparing and holding the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. In the autumn of
1900 the League of Struggle amalgamated with the St. Petersburg
Workers’ Organisation, and was recognised as the St. Petersburg
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. The struggle between the Iskrists and
Economists in the St. Petersburg Organisation ended in the summer of 1902
with the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. adopting an
Iskra stand.





[3]
Workers’ Organisation—an organisation of supporters of
Economism, which arose in St. Petersburg in the summer of 1900. In the
autumn of the same year it amalgamated with the League of Struggle for the
Emancipation of the Working Class, and the St. Petersburg Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. was formed, consisting of two parts: the Committee proper, and
the Committee of the Workers’ Organisation. With the Iskra
trend gaining the ascendancy in the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic
organisation (1902) the group of Economist-minded Social-Democrats broke
away from the St. Petersburg Committee and again set up an independent
Workers’ Organisation, which existed until the beginning of 1904.

December 27


We have received the letter about the coup
d’état[1]

and are replying at once. We
are astounded that Zarin could allow such a scandal! There you have the fruits
of his mistake in not joining the Committee!—a step we were insisting on
long ago. We shall not publish anything about the statement for the time being,
for we have received neither the statement nor the letter against it. Commence
hostilities by all means, make Zarin join, drew up a minute of the break (or
the number of votes pro and contra), and issue a local leaflet
on the causes of the split (or divergence). There is no sense in publishing the
statement without such official documents about each of your steps. Be sure to
put on record each step of the Rabocheye Dyelo supporters and of yours
against them, and do not yield one iota. They must be shown up as being against
the Organising Committee, whilst you are for it. It is on the basis of
recognition (or non-recognition) of the Organising Committee that decisive
battle should promptly be given everywhere; convey this most
insistently to Zarin and his immediate Genossen.


And so, let Zarin display redoubled energy and fight for Kiev—that is his
prime duty.


The literature is in Russia and should soon be in your hands. You must
send not less than two poods to our people in St. Petersburg, without fail.

revolutionary, Bolshevik, joined the Social-Democratic movement in 1893. In
1896 was arrested in connection with the activities of the St. Petersburg
League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and exiled to
Eastern Siberia. On his return from exile joined the Iskra
organisation; at the Pskov meeting of the Organising Committee for
convening the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (November 1902) was elected
a member of the O.C. At the Congress was elected, in his absence, to the
Central Committee and Council of the Party. In 1903-04 took an active part
in the fight against the Mensheviks abroad.

Dear friend,


As regards the
“examination”,[2] I must say that it is
impossible to propose an examination programme from here. Let all the
propagandists write about the programme on which they are lecturing or wish to
lecture, and I shall answer in detail. You ask for more questions to be put to
you. Very well, only mind you answer them all:
1) What are the present Rules of
the St. Petersburg Committee?
2) Is there “discussion”?
3) What is its position in relation to the
   Central Committee and the Workers’ Organisation?
4) The attitude of the
   C.C. to the district organisation and to the workers’ groups?
5) Why did the
   Iskrist workers tacitly permit Bouncer workers to call themselves a
   “Workers’ Organisation Committee”?
6) Have measures been taken to keep
   track of every step of the St. Petersburg Zubatov
organisation[3]?
7) Are regular lectures read (or talks arranged) in the workers’ circles on
   the subject of organisation, on the significance of an “organisation of
   revolutionaries”?
8) Is propaganda widely conducted among the
   workers to the effect that it is they who should pass to an illegal
   position as frequently and extensively as possible?
9) Have measures been
   taken to ensure ten times as many letters from St. Petersburg, the flow of
   which has been held up for a disgracefully long time?
10) Is the idea being
   inculcated among all workers that it is they who ought to organise a
   printing-press for leaflets and the proper distribution of the latter?

 

There are ten questions for you. I send you warm greetings
and await your reply. Mind you disappear at the first sign
that you are being spied on.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Babushkin, Ivan Vasilyevich (1873-1906)—a professional
revolutionary, started revolutionary activities in 1893. An active member
of the St. Petersburg and Ekaterinoslav Leagues of Struggle for the
Emancipation of the Working Class. Took an active part in organising the
Leninist newspaper Iskra (1900). An active participant in the
revolution of 1905-07.





[2]
Lenin received a letter from Babushkin asking him to make out a question
paper for “examining” members of the propagandist group, that
is, to ascertain their position in regard to Iskra principles.





[3]
Zubatov organisation pursued a policy of “police
socialism” initiated by S. V. Zubatov, a Colonel of the Gendarmes and
Chief of the Moscow Secret Political Police, under which legal
workers’ organisations were set up during 1901-03 for the purpose of
diverting the workers from the political struggle against the autocracy.

We have received (from somewhere abroad) a new Bouncer document, dated October
1902, a programme and principles of organisation—muddled and
pernicious. We are devilishly vexed and offended at your failure to send us
immediately and directly (in two copies to different addresses) all the
St. Petersburg productions. It is Simply outrageous that up to now we have not
had the first leaflet of the Bouncer people (the July “protest”
against the recognition of Iskra) and only learnt about it from
Otkliki![1] Surely it is not difficult to send
leaflets when
all letters arrive quite all right! More outrageous still is the fact that you
hold up your replies so long. Ignat has told us that his leaflet replying to the
Bouncer drivel was written a long time ago, but that you held it up and
substituted another one, longer, feebler and more watered-down, only in the end
to publish none at all! If it couldn’t be published, surely it could have
been sent here in a letter!


For Christ’s sake, explain what is the matter; is it due to sheer bungling
oversight on the part of someone in the Committee (or of the whole Committee?)
or to deliberate opposition and intrigue within the Committee?


We cannot rid ourselves of the impression inevitably created by all this:
namely, that the Bouncers are steadily ousting you, deceiving you and before
long will kick you out altogether.


We would strongly advise electing Bogdan in place of
the missing member of the Organising Commmittee from

    

St. Petersburg[2] he fully deserves it. And in general, apparently,
things will never advance an inch without professional revolutionaries.

“Supplement” to Otkliki (Comments) No. 1, December
1902, issued by the Svoboda group in Geneva.

January 15


(From Lenin.) Dear comrades, many thanks for your detailed letter on the state
of affairs; such letters are rarely written to us although we are in very great
need of them and ten times as many are essential if we really want to establish
a living connection between the editorial board abroad and the local Party
workers, and make Iskra a full reflection of our working-class
movement, both as a whole and as regards particular features of it. We therefore
beg you to continue on the same lines, and at least sometimes to give us
straight pictures of talks with workers (what do they talk about in the circles?
What are their complaints? perplexities? requirements? the subjects of the
talks? and so on and so forth).


The plan of your organisation, apparently, is suitable
for a rational organisation of revolutionaries, insofar as
it is possible to say “rational” when there is such a lack of
people, and insofar as we can judge of the plan from a brief
account of it.


Give us more details about the independents. Further questions: Are there no
workers of the “Ivanovo-Voznesensk” school and tradition left in
Kharkov? Are there any persons who once directly belonged to this Economist and
“anti-intellectualist” company or only their successors? Why
don’t you write anything about the “leaflet of workers’ mutual aid
societies”, and why don’t you send it to us? We here have seen only
a handwritten copy of No. 2 of this leaflet. What sort of group is issuing it?
Are they out-and-out Economists or merely green youths? Is it a purely working-class
organisation or is it under the influence of Economist intellectuals?

 

Are any traces left of the Kharkovsky
Proletary[1]
group?


Is Iskra read in the workers’ circles? With explanations of the
 articles? Which articles are more eagerly read and what kind of explanations
 are required?


Is propaganda of secrecy methods and transition to an illegal position
conducted among the workers on a large scale?


Try to make more use of the St. Petersburg Zubatov organisation
and go on sending workers’ letters.


Yours,

Lenin


 
Notes

We have just received No. 16 of Rabochaya
Mysl[1] (from
Geneva) and No. 2 and 3 of Rabochaya Mysl Listki from
St. Petersburg. It is now as clear as daylight that the Bouncers are fooling you
and leading you by the nose when they as sure you of their agreement with
Zarya and Iskra. Come out with a militant protest immediately
(if you are not able to publish it, send it here at once, in any case a copy),
wage war vigorously and carry it widely into the midst of the workers. Any delay
and any conciliation with the Bouncers would now be not only arch-stupidity but
absolutely disgraceful. And so long as you have Bogdan, you can’t
complain of being shorthanded (help has been sent). Reply at once what steps you
are taking.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Issue No. 16 of Rabochaya Mysl for November-December 1902
contained “A Protest of the Workers’ Organisation
Committee” against the statement of the St. Petersburg Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P. recognising the newspaper Iskra and the journal

   

Zarya as the leading organs of the Party. The same issue published
a letter of the Workers’ Organisation Committee to the
Svoboda group and the Otkliki editorial board expressing
gratitude for their sympathy and readiness to give support. The
Rabochaya Mysl Listki were issued by the Iskrist St. Petersburg
Committee in December 1902 and January 1903 in place of the newspaper
Rabochaya Mysl. Listok No. 1 was destroyed by decision of the
Committee in view of its unhappy wording.

January 16


We have received from Geneva Rabochaya Mysl No. 16 (evidently published
and even written by Svoboda, i.e., by Nadezhdin) already labelled as
the organ of the St. Petersburg Committee. It has a letter of the Bouncers
making a correction, a trivial correction, strictly speaking not a correction at
all but a compliment to Svoboda. If the Bouncers assure you of
their solidarity with Zarya and Iskra, that is obvious
deception, the sheer humbug of people who are playing for time in order to gain
strength. We earnestly and insistently advise you therefore to issue immediately (and if you cannot issue it, send it here) a leaflet protesting in the
name of the Committee and in general to refute all conciliatory manoeuvres and
approaches, and to launch a vigorous war, a ruthless war, against the Bouncers,
with an exposure of their defection from Social-Democracy to the
“Revolutionary-Socialist” Svoboda. We approve the
energetic behaviour of Novitskaya and once again ask you to continue in the same
militant spirit, without allowing the slightest vacillations. War on the
Bouncers and to hell with all conciliators, people of “elusive
views” and shilly-shallyers! Better a small fish than a big beetle. Better two or three energetic and wholly devoted people than a dozen
dawdlers. Write as often as possible and, without delay, give us access
to your workers (and a characterisation of them) so that in case of arrests we
shall not be stranded.

January 27


Old Man writing. I have read your angry letter of January 3 and am replying at
once. Regarding correspondence,
dogs,[1] etc., the
secretary[2]
will reply below: I can no longer make out who is to blame but we
absolutely must be in constant touch, not less frequently than twice a month,
but so far this has not been the case and we have heard nothing about you for
long periods at a time. Don’t forget that when we have no letters, we
can’t do anything, we do not know whether people are alive or not; we are
compelled, simply compelled, to consider them almost non-existent. You did not
answer my question about Brutus’s transference; apparently, there is
little hope of any good arrangement until this transference takes place. Now to
business. In criticising us, you overestimate our strength and influence; we
reached agreement here about the Organising Committee, we insisted on its
meeting, on your being invited, and we wrote to you. We could do nothing more
than that, absolutely nothing, and we do not answer for anything. The trouble is
that Brutus was not in the Organising Committee, and all subsequent action was
taken without him (as also without us). We have not accepted an unknown member
(he is of the dawdler type, unintelligent; I knew him personally in Pskov, tied
down by family and place, backward, no good at all, Pankrat had already been
criticised because of him), we have not transferred the bureau, we have given
absolutely no “power” to Pankrat. But when it turned out that
Pankrat was the sole (N.B., N.B.) mobile person of the Organising Committee,
the result could not but be power as well. You write:
there are people, but we do not have them, do not know them, do not see them. We
have worked ourselves up to

    

neurasthenia over the total lack of persons for the Organising Committee, which
requires mobile, flying, free and illegal people. Pankrat alone went over to
illegality, travelled, began to fly, began to know everything—and assumed
the rank of corporal as a matter of course. We did not interfere, naturally,
because we neither could interfere nor wanted to interfere; there was no other!
Try to understand this. Pankrat is indolent and careless, but he is clever,
sensible, knows the job, knows how to fight and is a man you can get on
with. Now he is stranded [in Paris I indefinitely, and we are
going for him baldheaded, driving him to Russia, as otherwise the Organising
Committee is nothing but a cipher. “She” (Akim’s brother) will
go shortly, we shall try to get “her” into the O.C.;
“she”, I believe, is energetic. Pen does not want to go away. There
are no passports, and no copies. If Brutus moves to a nearby, lively place, we
shall help him to get the bureau
back,[3] and everything will be
straightened out, perhaps. Otherwise everything will proceed (if it does
proceed) by the will of Allah, the will of Pankrat, and “her” will,
and we are powerless in the matter.


The literature has been sent off. Over 40 poods have been shipped. We are
publishing the statement of the Organising Committee in No. 32, which will come
out the day after tomorrow.


Uncle, too, is still standing aside (like Brutus) and has not even gone
anywhere; if only he and Brutus would settle in Poltava at least, they
would take over the bureau.


I am very annoyed with Zarin; his letters convey nothing, he is inert, knows
nothing about Kiev, and has allowed a split to take place under his very
nose. To keep aloof from local affairs to such an extent is simply outrageous!
Is it our fault that, of the two “equal members” of the Organising
Committee, Zarin “sits and says nothing”, while Pankrat at least is
stirring a little? I think (I don’t know for certain) that Zarin is a
person with little initiative and one who is tied down by legality and
place. And now such people, alas, remain aloof, and through no fault or will of
ours.

In reply to the letter of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats to the League
of Russian Revolutionary Social Democracy, received by us on February 4, 1903,
we hasten to inform the Union of Russian Social-Democrats that we entirely,
share its opinion as to the need to form a foreign section of the Organising
Committee in Russia. It is true that we cannot at all agree with the opinion of
the Union of the R.S.D. that the Organising Committee “wrongly or
inaccurately ascribes its origin to private initiative”, for the
O.C. refers directly to the decision of the conference (the O.C. was in fact set
up in fulfilment of such a decision). Moreover, the O.C. was formed by
organisations which took part in the conference. The fact that the O.C. has not
straight away and without inquiring the opinion of the remaining Party
organisations declared itself an official Party body is, in our view, evidence
of the Organising Committee’s correct understanding of its tasks, and of
its tact and caution, which are so important in a serious Party matter.


It should be said at once, though, that we do not attach any great importance
to our above-mentioned disagreement with the Union of the R.S.D.; on the
contrary, we have every hope that this disagreement will be easily dispelled
with the development of the Organising Committee’s activity.


Farther, we would consider it inexpedient, even not quite lawful on our part,
“to proceed immediately to constitute a foreign section of the
O.C.”, unless there was a direct invitation from the O.C. in Russia. We
have been

    

informed that the O.C. has already written to the Bund in Russia and to the
Union of the R.S.D. Abroad. We do not have the text of either letter. In any
case, it follows from the above that the O.C. in Russia is already taking steps
in this direction. It would hardly be wise on our part to begin to act without
waiting for the result of these steps of the Organising Committee.


We consider it our duty to bring the letter of the Union of the
R.S.D. immediately to the notice of the O.C. in Russia and at the same time we
shall communicate to the O.C. our opinion of the desirability
of the O.C. in Russia immediately setting up its foreign section. We would suggest waiting for a reply from the O.C. in Russia. If, how ever, the comrades of
the Bund Committee Abroad and of the Union of the R.S.D. consider that, before
receiving this reply, it would be useful to arrange a private meeting
of representatives of the Bund Committee Abroad, the Union of the R.S.D., and
the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy, we would not, of course,
refuse to take part.


The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Simultaneously with this letter Lenin wrote the “Draft Appeal of the
Russian Organising Committee to the League of Russian Revolutionary
Social-Democracy, the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and the
Foreign Committee of the Bund” (see Vol. 6 of this edition) and sent
it on February 5 to Martov in Paris to be discussed with the members of the
Russian Organising Committee P. A. Krasikov and V. A. Noskov, who had
arrived there.

February 5,1903


I am sending you a copy of the Union’s letter and the draft of our
reply.[1]

The reply was sent to Plekhanov who was to await your letter from Paris. Arrange
a meeting with P. Andr. and Boris immediately and answer Plekhanov as
quickly as possible whether you are satisfied with the reply or whether
changes are required. It would be desirable, of course, not to delay the reply
to the Unionists, but if changes are voted it will entail a pretty long delay;
perhaps unimportant changes can be disregarded. But, of course, if there is
disagreement on the substance of the question, it will be necessary to hold up
the reply (I am writing to Plekhanov about this) and have everyone vote.


In my opinion (with which V. I. and L. Gr. agree) the most important thing here
is that 1) the foreign section of the
O.C.[4] should be precisely a
section of the Organising Committee in Russia. The Unionists’ idea, I
believe, is to have two sections with equal rights: one in Russia, the
other abroad. By no means can we accept or allow such an interpretation. The
O.C. in Russia must act cautiously (in this respect its announcement is
admirably drawn up), but in all matters and in all approaches
made to it, must behave with the utmost formality and rigour, that is
to say, in such a way that it, the O.C. in Russia, controls every thing and
no one in the Party can do anything of a general Party
character or in the way of general obligations, unless authorised to do so
by the Organising Committee in Russia.

 

Yet the Unionists, by their letter, recognise (or almost three-quarters
recognise) the O.C. and the more they recognise it, the more formally and
firmly must the Organising Committee behave. It is of the highest importance to
adopt the right tone from the very beginning and to take such a stand that the
Party position is made quite clear: either recognition of the
present O.C. and subordination to it, or
war. Tertium non
datur.[2]

Even now there is every chance of obtaining
general recognition, without offending or irritating anyone, but
without giving way in the slightest degree.


2) The O.C. should reduce the functions of its foreign section to a
minimum. The foreign section only “deals with” affairs
   abroad (in the sense of preparing for unity) and assists
   the Russian section. On every other question that goes the least beyond those
   limits, the foreign section of the O.C. must request the opinion and
   decision of the Organising Committee in Russia. I strongly urge,
   therefore, that the O.C. in Russia should as soon as possible write
   a letter to the Union, the League and the Bund proposing that they should
   form a section of their own for exercising such-and-such
   functions. It is essential that the O.C. in Russia should indicate the
   “limits of authority” to its foreign section, and I propose below
   an outline of these functions with three and only three strictly
   limited items. I earnestly request you to discuss this draft as quickly as
   possible with P. A. and Boris and confirm it (alternatively, put changes to
   the vote). (We shall send all these data to
Yuri[5] as well,
   asking him to await the arrival of P. A. and Boris, who should do everything
   to hasten their arrival.)


(Of course, P. A. could write a letter to the League, the
Union and the Bund Committee Abroad from here, but I
think this is in the highest degree undesirable, for people
will suspect a put-up job and a fiction. Better to wait a
week or two, and have the letter sent without fail from
Russia.)


I also believe we must think of electing a member of ours to the O.C. (the
foreign section) and vote on it in advance, for owing to the members being in
different

    

places this can take much time and it will be unpleasant if things have to
wait on this account. For my part, I vote for L. Gr.


I positively do not have time to write to Plekhanov as well. You will
simply forward to him at once both this letter and the reply to the
Union, and meanwhile I will drop him a line.


All the best.


Lenin

As regards the appeal, I (Lenin) find your decision reasonable
[3]—I have not had time yet (nor a chance) to consult my
associates.[1]

The courage of the Nizhni-Novgorod workers, who asked that their
personal well-being should not be taken into account, ought to be mentioned in
Iskra; it would be desirable for you to write a letter about this to
the editors.


We received via Berlin the “Letter to the Iskra Editorial Board
from the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee”, a long letter, about terrorism, with
a defence (partial and conditional) of terrorism; the end is missing
(apparently). Write immediately:


1) Did the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee send this letter officially?


2) Repeat the end of it (the letter has seven paragraphs and ends with the
words: “They clear the atmosphere, which is often too heavy, they teach
the government to handle the revolutionaries more carefully”).


3) Let us know whether you allow stylistic corrections (in some places the style
is very bad, due perhaps to incorrect, hasty and unclear copying).


We shall probably publish the letter together with our reply.


We earnestly and insistently beg you to inform us in your letters
without delay of every official step taken by the Committee (dispatch of a
document for travelling warrants...,

    

list of leaflets, answer to another committee or to a group abroad,
and so on and so forth). Otherwise there are bound to be
misunderstandings,[2]

mistakes and bureaucratic delays. Iskrists should pull together and inform
Iskra speedily and comprehensively.


All the very best.


 
Notes
 

[1]
I may yet be able to return to this question.
—Lenin

[2]
For example, we have heard a lot of tittle-tattle and abuse about the
  Committee’s leaflet again a demonstration on the day of the
  trial.[4] The leaflet itself we received not long ago by
  chance; from Berlin, and with delay. Good heavens! This is simply outrageous! Surely it wasn’t difficult for the Committee to write to us
  about the leaflet and send us a copy of it as soon as it came
  out. For heaven’s sake, take all the necessary steps to correct
  these shortcomings.
—Lenin
 



[3]
The Nizhni-Novgorod Committee decided not to appeal against the sentence
passed on the workers of Sormovo and Nizhni-Novgorod in connection with the
May Day demonstration of 1902.





[4]
The leaflet “To All Nizhni-Novgorodians” issued by the
Nizhni-Novgorod Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. was disseminated in the city
two days before the trial of the workers, which was held on October 29-31,
1902.

I have received the letter of the O.C. I suggest answering like this:


“In our opinion, the question of the ‘ordre du jour’ stands as
follows. This question of the agenda will be definitely settled by the
Congress itself, and only by the Congress. Consequently, it is quite
useless to dispute about the right to vote on this point. Further, the
bulk of the committees have already recognised the ‘exclusive
initiative’ of the O.C. in convening the Congress. Hence it follows that the
preliminary preparation for the Congress, including preliminary
preparation (or propaganda) of the ordre du jour, is
exclusively a matter for the Organising Committee. It is, therefore,
altogether superfluous to propose that anyone should vote as well on a
‘preliminary’ ordre du jour; it cannot have any
decisive significance. Furthermore, it will merely cause both
delay and dissatisfaction, for there will be people who will be
offended (committees that were not consulted), and people who will
inevitably be dissatisfied and complaining. Consequently, from the
standpoint of both formal loyalty and tact no formal decision should be
taken about collecting the votes of the committees or of anyone at all. It would
only undermine the authority of the Organising Committee if it renounces the
exclusive initiative entrusted to it.


“If it is very inconvenient now to alter an adopted (and formally
unexceptionable) decision, there may be, perhaps, the following way out: turn
the voting (of the commit tees) into a consultation with them, that is
to say, adopt a decision that as far as possible the O.C. will try to make use
of meetings and talks for consultation.

 

“Finally, we advise making haste with the Congress. The sooner you convene
it, the better. And set to work immediately and more actively preparing the
committees, nominating delegates, winning over Nikolayev and
Odessa. The important thing is to make perfectly sure of a safe majority of
firm Iskrists.”


Nevzorov disgraced himself yesterday, and Charles Rappoport and Krichevsky gave
him a dressing down. There were no
Iskrists.[1]


I shall be leaving probably on, Sunday. The trains arrive not at 6 but at 3.45
and 10.45. With one of them, probably.


Yours....


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the dispute following his lecture in Paris on March 3-6
1903, on the agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
Russian Social-Democrats. Nevzorov (Y. M. Steklov) was one of Lenin’s
opponents in this dispute.

We have just received the rules of the Congress. It appears that we did not
understand you and replied about the ordre du jour when you were asking
about the rules of the Congress. We hasten to say that on the whole we
are very satisfied with your draft, which is carefully and sensibly drawn
up. Clause 19, which has evoked dispute, seems reasonable to us; to exclude
certain organisations from the Congress (and, in the final analysis, the rules
are precisely regulations for the exclusion of some and the granting of rights
to others) is in fact inconvenient and impossible without the agreement of the
majority of the committees. Our only advice would be to fix a formally binding
period as short as possible (for example, not more than a week) in the course of
which the committees and organisations are obliged to draw up and send
in their amendments to the draft rules. This is essential in order to avoid
delay, which is most of all to be feared. (It is probably through fear of delay
that Ignat, too, protested. We understand his fears, but if you are able to
complete the interrogation quickly, the matter can be put right.)


For our part, we shall write to the Iskra organisations about our
advice that your draft should be accepted im mediately and completely. We
earnestly request you to make use of every facility to ensure that the dispatch
and communication of the draft (on the basis of § 19), the “session” of
the arbitration courts, and determination of the composition of the deputies
will be completed within a month at the latest.

 

In this connection we advise you informally to recommend all qualified
organisations to appoint as far as possible one (or two) delegates from
among comrades living abroad who are known for their past work—in order to
avoid extra expenses and difficulties involved in sending delegates abroad.


We formally propose 1) to supplement your draft only by a note to § 19:
“Organisations which have not presented their comments within a week from
the date of receipt of the draft will be regarded as having accepted the draft
rules of the Congress”; 2) to make provision for alternate delegates in
the event of delegates being arrested before the Congress.

March 15, 1903


Dear G. V.,


I have received your letter. You are writing “The Ides of
March”, that is excellent. The dead-line is March 25, 1903—the
article must be here. We expect it without fail.



Maslov’s book is being sent to me in a few days from
Paris (I shall ask them to make haste) and I shall send it
on to you at
once.[3] It contains interesting data on the
harm of the village commune, which I quoted in
Paris.[4]


I had already ordered David’s book and am now reading
it. Terribly watery, poor and trite. I am trying to finish
it quickly so as to send it on to you. Have you seen Kant-
sky’s articles on this
“neo-Proudhonist”[5]?


I have now set to work on a popular pamphlet for the peas-
ants on our agrarian
programme.[1]

I should very much
like to demonstrate our idea of the class struggle in the
countryside on the basis of concrete data on the four sections of the village population (landowners, peasant bourgeoisie, middle peasantry, and semi-proletarians together
with proletarians). What do you think of such a plan?


From Paris I came away with the conviction that only
such a pamphlet could dispel the perplexities about the
cut-off lands, etc.


About the Manifesto of February 26 I have written an
article which will appear in No.
34,[2]

I have categorically
insisted that it should be the leading article in view of the
tremendous importance of the Manifesto. It seems, however,

    

that V. I. is wavering (!) and together with Y. O. is
deciding the other way round: first about Marx.


In my opinion, this is even preposterous.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin

We advise that steps be taken immediately to have the O.C. together
with the Polish Social-Democrats issue a formal declaration (as detailed and
precise as possible) on their full solidarity with the Russian S.D.L.P. and
their desire to join the Party. On the basis of such a formally published
statement the O.C. could invite the Polish Social-Democrats to the
Congress. Then, surely, no one will
protest.[1]


Next (privately), we earnestly request you everywhere and among everyone to
prepare the ground for a struggle against the Bund at the Congress. Without a
stubborn struggle the Bund will not surrender its position. And we can never
accept its position. Only firm determination on our part to go through to the
end, to the expulsion of the Bund from the Party, will undoubtedly compel it to
give way.


Make haste with the list; it is very important and must be done quickly, without
waiting for a reply from the committees. By the way, were the committees given
a short time within which to reply? Are you keeping a list of the delegates
already appointed? (Send it to us as an additional precaution.)


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Polish Social-Democrats’ statement of solidarity with the
R.S.D.L.P. did not appear in Iskra. Representatives of the Polish
Social-Democratic Party attended the Second Congress as non-voting
delegates.

(The Old Man.)


There is little I can tell you this time. The main thing now, in my opinion, is
to make every effort to expedite the Congress and ensure a majority of
intelligent (and “our”) delegates. Almost all our hope is on
Brutus. As far as possible, he should himself keep an eye on
everything, especially the delegates, and try to get the maximum number of
our people appointed. The system of two votes from each committee is very
favourable for this. Next, the question of the Bund is very important. We have
stopped the polemic with it over the O.C., but not, of course, the polemic over
principles. That is out of the question. We must make everyone understand,
simply “ram it into every head”, that it is necessary to prepare
for war against the Bund if we want peace with it. War at the Congress, war even
to the extent of a split—whatever the cost. Only then will the Bund be
sure to surrender. We absolutely cannot accept, and never will accept, the
stupid idea of federation. At the very most—autonomy according to the old
Rules of 1898 with a delegate appointed by the C.C. taking part in the C.C. of
the Bund. We must prepare our people, we must explain the stupidity and
demonstrate the absurdity of the attack on
Ekaterinoslav,[1] and so
on. Please write speedily and let us know what the feeling is in this respect,
how your propaganda is going and whether there is any hope of the majority
taking the right stand. We should like to issue a pamphlet to the Jewish workers
on the necessity of a close union and the stupidity of federation and
“national” policy.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Bund’s attack on the Ekaterinoslav Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. is
fully dealt with in Lenin’s article “Does the Jewish
Proletariat Need an ‘Independent Political Party’?” (see
Vol. 6 of this edition).

April 6,1903


In transmitting to the O.C. the inquiry of the foreign section of the
O.C.[1] we for our part earnestly advise you not to widen the
functions of the foreign section in any way and not to allow it to extend its
bounds by a single inch, as it is making every effort to do. In the interests of
the work, the functions of the foreign section of the O.C. should in no way go
beyond preparing the secret part of the Congress, collecting money and, at most,
discussion of the conditions for uniting the Social-Democratic organisations
abroad in the form of a preliminary preparation of this
question. Regarding point I a), we are strongly against giving the address of
the O.C.’s foreign section to the committees. The functions of the foreign
section being what they are, this is quite pointless. It is not without its
dangers in the sense of causing delay and confusion. As regards publicity, it
should be frankly stated that everything will be published in Iskra
(the formal basis for this is its recognition by the majority of the
committees). Other organisations should be formally recommended to reprint all
the statements of the O.C. from Iskra. As regards contact between the
O.C. and its foreign, section, we advise the following arrangement:
the O.C. will communicate with Deutsch through the usual channels
(Deutsch is the secretary of the O.C. ’s foreign section, which also
includes Alexander and Lokhov). And you will communicate with Deutsch
through us, as before. This is quite natural; the foreign section of the
O.C. elected a secretary and you have endorsed his election.

 

To the second question we advise that you reply by
agreeing, and to the third by an explanation that the agenda
will be presented and is already being prepared.

I have read your long letter, for which many thanks. Better late than never. You
ask me not to be very cross. As a matter of fact, I was hardly cross at all, and
was more inclined to smile at the recollection of my last conversation at the
door of the
“den”[4] with a certain Jacques, who considered at
that time (at that time!) that we did too little bossing. That things take a
long time adjusting themselves within the O.C., that there is still a huge
amount of disorder and anarchy, I was quite aware and have not expected
anything else. The only cure for that is persistent treatment (time and
experience) and a single potent remedy (a general Party congress). I wrote long
ago and I repeat it:
hurry up, for heaven’s sake, with this remedy as much as you can,
otherwise there is a risk of your experience being lost altogether.


I am not going to write about the questions of
1) Yuri,[5] 2) the
Bureau, and 3) Ignat’s dispute with Bundist. In part, they have become
obsolete; in part, they require to be settled on the spot, and as regards this
last part my ad vice at best would be to no purpose (despite the opinion of my
friend Jacques). This part you (all of you) have to decide for yourselves,
“have to” not in the sense of
sollen[1]

but of
müssen.[2]


I will say something about tile Bund, the
P.P.S.[6] and “heresy”.


Formally, I think, our attitude to the Bund should be studiously correct (no
hitting straight in the teeth), but

    

at the same time icily cold, buttoned up to the neck, and on legitimate grounds
we should press hard against the Bund relentlessly and all the time, going right
to the end without being afraid. Let them get out, if they want to, but we
should not give them the slightest occasion, the shadow of an excuse, for a
break. We must, of course, observe the formalities prior to the Congress, but
there is no point in showing our cards. You write: Bundist knows we are working
for Iskra but keeps silent, although we have no right to do so in the
name of the O.C. In my opinion, this should not be done from the O.C. but from
each member personally, referring not to the O.C., but to the
committees which have recognised Iskra. The result is the same and even
much stronger (there are no “agents”), and the formal aspect is
irreproachable. Preparing the committees against the Bund is one of the most
important tasks of the present moment, and it, too, is fully possible
without any violation of form.


Similarly, it was wrong to speak to the P.P.S. about the “convictions of
members of the Organising Committee”. It should have been said of
the O.C.: we are preparing the congress, and the congress will decide;
and on the question of “convictions” one should not remain silent
but refer, not to the O.C., but to Iskra and still more to the
commit tees that have recognised Iskra. Furthermore, we should obtain
from the P.P.S. a formal if only short document (a letter), and not say to them
“we are anti-nationalists” (why frighten people needlessly?), but
gently persuade them that our programme (recognition of the right of national
self-determination) is adequate for them too, drawing from them definite
counter-declarations and a formal approach to the O.C. and the
Congress. Our trump card against the P.P.S. is that we recognise national
self-determination in principle, but within reasonable limits determined by the
unity of the proletarian class struggle.


Before I forget: I really do not know the representatives of the Russian
organisation of Iskra in the O.C. Nor do I know why I should know this,
and why there should be “representatives”. The Organising Committee
has long ago co-opted all sorts of good people, but they were not
“representatives”, were they? Or is this untrue?

 

It is important, I think, to make use of the distinction between the Russian
organisation of Iskra and the O.C. precisely for the sake of formal
irreproachability.


Now about “heresy”. Either I misunderstand you, or this is a great
mistake. In view of the extreme brevity of your letter on this (highly
important) point, I can only take your words á la lettre. Four
delegates “organise” both the C.C. and the Central Organ! Frankly,
this is simply ridiculous, for you ought to know that the only people competent
(i.e., having the knowledge and necessary experience) to
“organise” the Central Organ are the members of the editorial board+
individuals from outside for consultation, while the only people
competent to organise the C.C. are experienced practical workers+individuals
for consultation (if you know of such persons). Or do you, perhaps, know of a
“foursome” who have experience and knowledge of all these
things? If you do, then name them—seriously, I am not joking, for this
letter of mine is a personal one and it is important for me to be clear about
your idea.


You are out for a single centre of power and a “strong hand”, if I
am not mistaken. It would be a good thing and you are absolutely right that that
is what we need. But no one can achieve it in such a forthright way as you are
thinking of. For nine-tenths of current affairs, two central bodies are
absolutely essential; they would immediately arise of themselves, even if we did
not want this. For form’s sake, however, we should try to achieve 1) a
formal way of uniting these two central bodies (for example, a committee with
delegates from both of them), 2) a reduction in the number of members of the two
central bodies, or the selection of an executive committee within each central
body, and—most important—3) a strict, formal distribution
of functions among individual members of the central bodies, so that their whole
membership should know precisely which member is charged with managing
what, which member (in each centre) has the right to decide (and even
to speak) in each sphere of problems, and in what way matters can be transferred to a plenary meeting of one or both of the central bodies.


I am confident that you will considerably moderate your demands and will agree
that this is the maximum immediately

    

desirable. Even that is very, very difficult and I do not see any
people who are fully suitable, informed, and experienced enough for such a
distribution of functions. There is a great deal, a vast amount of mismanagement
both among you and us (you, members of the O.C., should not
think only of yourselves, you “organise” the whole Party),
and we must think out not pia desideria, but practical, firm,
“first steps”.


I have expressed my views to you frankly and I should be very glad of a
further exchange of letters with you. Really and truly, you ought to
write more often and in more detail on such questions. I have nothing against
this letter being communicated to the whole O.C., I should even welcome it, but
I leave the decision to you. You did well to mention to whom your
letter was addressed.


All the best. Moderate your demands and hurry, hurry, hurry with the
“potent remedy”. Best regards.


Yours,

Lenin

September 7, 1903


I have just received your letter and hasten to reply. Yes, I see that
you are already well informed and that the sum of the information that makes you
so is tinctured—as well it would be—a definite colour. I understand
also that what has happened is bound to worry you.


But it is one thing to know and another to understand, as you justly write, and
I am deeply convinced that it is impossible to understand what has happened from
the stand point of “the effect of a nervous breakdown”. A nervous
breakdown could only give rise to sharp animosity, fury and a reckless attitude
to results, but the results them selves are utterly inescapable and their advent
has long been merely a question of time.


“Riffraff” and “praetorians”—you say. That is not the
case. The political alignment was im Grossen und Ganzen as follows:
five Bundists, three Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, four Yuzhny
Rabochy-ists, six from the “Marsh” or indecisives, nine
Iskrists of the soft line (or Zickzackkurs) and twenty-four Iskrists of
the firm line; these are voting members, and, of course, approximate. There have
been cases when everything was mixed up differently, but à vol
d’oiseau this, on the whole, was how the groups worked out. The biggest
shuffle (over equality of languages), when many Iskrists vacillated, left us
with not less than 23 (out of a total of 33 Iskrists) and even among these 23
the “Martovites” were in a minority. And do you know the result of
the vote at the meeting of the 16? Sixteen members of the Iskra
organisation, and not “riffraff” nor “praetorians”? Do
you know that here, too, Martov was in the minority both on the
question of the person who had been the apple of discord
and on the question of lists?

 

The minority of Iskrists of the soft or zigzag line defeated the majority (on
the question of the Rules, and more than once) by a coalition of the Bund+the
Marsh+the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists. And when the Bund and Rabocheye
Dyelo withdrew, the majority of the Iskrists had their own back. Voilà
tout. And not a single person has any doubt that, if the Bund had not
withdrawn, Martov would have beaten us over the central bodies. And to make such
a finale a reason for resentment, offence, a split in the Party! It is
madness. The story goes that the “praetorians” ousted people because
of a slanderous accusation of opportunism, that they cast
slurs on and removed active people, etc. That is mere idle talk, the
fruit of an imaginary grievance, rien de plus. No one, absolutely no
one had “slurs” cast upon him or was removed, prevented from taking
part in the work. Some one or other was merely removed from the central
body—is that a matter for offence? Should the Party be torn apart for
that? Should a theory of hypercentralism be constructed on that account? Should
there be talk of rule by a rod of iron, etc., on that account? Never for a
moment, have I doubted or been capable of doubting that a trio of editors is the
sole genuinely business-like trio, which does not break up anything,
but adapts the old “family” collegium to the role of someone in an
official capacity. It is precisely the family character of the Six that
has been tormenting us all these three years, as you know only too
well, and from the moment Iskra became the Party and the Party
became Iskra, we had to, were obliged to, break with
the Six and its family character. It was for this reason that already prior to
the Congress I declared that I was, going to demand freedom of election of the
editorial board—or the trio—which is the sole basis also for
sensible co-optation.


The break with the “family character” was absolutely essential and I
am confident the Six would have peacefully accepted this trio but for the
accompanying squabbles over 1 and over the C.C. It is only these
squabbles that in their eyes painted the trio in this “horrible”,
absolutely false hue. There is nothing “horrible” in it at all, and
it was essential to impose a restraint on the Zickzackkurs, and the
majority of the Iskrists (both at the Congress and within the Iskra
organisation) understood this perfectly well.

 

No, I repeat, the finale is not an “unforeseen calamity”, it is not
a “division of the whole”. That is untrue. It is untrue that one can
curse the day of “promotion”—or all our old work would remain for
ever a torment of Tantalus. And in the Party, on its formal basis, With
subordination of everything to the
Rules[1]

(over which we quarrelled desperately not without reason, quarrelled over every trifle with Martov, who
beat us on this point), in such a Party the old family editorial board
(not once in three years—this is a fact—did it meet with
the full number of six members) was impossible, the more so because the
non-Iskrists entered the Party in a bunch by right, on formal grounds. And this
called for a firm and consistent line, and not a zig zag policy. There is no
returning to the old, and only a disordered imagination can picture Martov being
led to the slaughter instead of to joint work with comrades, of whom each has
his shade of the political line. Actually, I would add, this trio,
throughout these three years, in 99 cases out of a hundred, had always
been the decisive, politically decisive(and not literary) central body.


Now, after Martov beat the majority of the Iskrists by alliance with
the Bund and made every preparation for beating them by this alliance
on the question of the central bodies as well, I find “their”
complaints about riffraff and praetorians, their laments about the
“crystal” of Iskra’s editorial board ludicrous. He
beat them by an alliance, I say, and not by a deal; I would not think of
accusing them of a deal with the Marsh and the Bund, nothing of the
sort. When “they” talk about “defamatory rumours” (of
being allies of the Bundists) being spread against them, “they” are
repeating their usual mistake of confusing the personal and the political. A
deal would be personally ugly. The alliance did not depend on their
will, their alliance was caused by their mistake; it was not they who went
with the Bund+the Marsh, but the Bund+the+Marsh+Yuzhny Rabochy,
etc., who followed them, having grasped at once which of the Iskrists had to be
supported from the anti Iskrist standpoint. The Bund+the Marsh, etc., only

    

revealed politically Martov’s organisational and tactical
mistake.


For one who knows all the facts of the Congress and especially the distribution
of Iskrist votes (both at the Congress and in the underground organisation of
Iskra) there cannot be any doubt that there is no going back. The
Iskrists have parted company, but Iskra could not exist apart
from the Iskrists. And, I repeat, among the Iskrists Martov was
definitely in a minority, and a split in the Party (towards which
Martov is fatally heading, more and more each day) will be a revolt of
the minority, a minority that is in the wrong both juridically and still
more in all essentials.


We “cast slurs” neither on Martov nor on anyone else for their
mistake, but call all of them to the work.


As regards the “material means” of which you speak, we are hard up
just now, it goes without saying, and the
Californian[3] sources have
gone up in smoke. But, if it came to that, we could endure even extreme need, so
long as all the work of many years is not allowed to be wrecked through
dissatisfaction with the composition of the central bodies (for objectively
“their” dissatisfaction amounts only to this).


“Must the bucket too be
shared?”[4] you ask. I could hardly answer
this question, for I make no claim to impartiality in
“sharing”, and you do not need an answer that is not impartial. I am
convinced that there are no “fractional parts”, but there is a
senseless attempt to break to pieces, smash and scatter the whole (to
build a new hearth, as you put it) owing to defeat on a single question
where the defeated Iskrists were utterly wrong.


All the best.

September 13, 1903


I tried to have a talk with Y. O. recently, when the atmosphere of the impending
split was already in full evidence, and I want to try to have a talk with you
too, in the hope that you, like Y. O., would not be averse to making an attempt
at explanation. If this hope is unfounded, you will, of course, let me know, but
meanwhile I shall do what I consider necessary.


The refusal of Martov to serve on the editorial board, his refusal and that of
other Party writers to collaborate, the refusal of a number of persons to work
for the Central Committee, and the propaganda of a boycott or passive resistance
are bound to lead, even if against the wishes of Martov and his friends, to a
split in the Party. Even if Martov adheres to a loyal stand (which he took up so
resolutely at the Congress), others will not, and the out come I have mentioned
will be inevitable. (Not for nothing, by the way, does Auntie, too, write
about “building a new hearth”.)


And so I ask myself: over what, in point of fact, would we be parting company as
enemies for life? I go over all the events and impressions of the
Congress,[1] I realise that I often behaved and acted in a state of
frightful irritation, “frenziedly”; I am quite willing to admit
this fault of mine to anyone, if that can be called a fault which was
a natural product of the atmosphere, the reactions, the in terjections, the
struggle, etc. But examining now, quite unfrenziedly, the results attained, the
outcome achieved by frenzied struggle, I can detect nothing, absolutely
nothing

    

in these results that is injurious to the Party, and absolutely nothing
that is an affront or insult to the Minority.


Of course, the very fact of finding oneself in the minority could not but be
vexatious, but I categorically protest against the idea that we “cast
slurs” on anybody, that we wanted to insult or humiliate
anybody. Nothing of the kind. And one should not allow political differences to
lead to an interpretation of events based on accusing the other side of
unscrupulousness, chicanery, intrigue and other pleasantries we are hearing
mentioned more and more often in this atmosphere of an impending split. This
should not be allowed, for it is, to say the least, the nec plus ultra
of irrationality.


Martov and I have had a political (and organisational) difference, as we had
dozens of times before. Defeated over 1 of the Rules, I could not but
strive with all my might for revanche in what remained to me (and to
the Congress). I could not but strive, on the one hand, for a strictly Iskrist
Central Committee, and, on the other, for a trio on the editorial board that
would remove the very cause of our old, hopeless quarrels, that would unite per
sons of whom each has his own political line, of whom each makes decisions and
will always make decisions “with out regard for persons” and in
keeping with his own extreme conviction.


I said (during our conversation with you and Y. O. about the trio before the
Congress) that I regarded the inclusion in the Six of an absentee
member[2]
as most harmful of all for the work; I also took exception at the time,
very strong exception, to Zasulich’s highly personal attitude (although
Y. O. has forgotten it); I said quite definitely (when you named the most
probable elected trio) that I too considered it the most probable and that
even if it remained alone, without going in for any co-optation (although at the time we mentioned one of the possible cooptations), I saw nothing
bad in that. Yuli Osipovich has forgotten this last statement of mine too, but I
remember it very well. But it is, of course, useless to argue about this. That
is not important; what is important is that with such a trio not one of those
painful, long-drawn-out, hope less quarrels with which we began the work of
Iskra in 1900 and which were often repeated, making it impossible for

    

us to work for months on end—a     single one of such
quarrels would be possible. That is why I consider this trio the only
business-like arrangement, the only one capable of being an official
institution, instead of a body based on indulgence and slackness, the
only one to be a real centre, each member of which, I repeat, would
always state and defend his Party viewpoint, not one grain more, and irrespective of all personal motives, all considerations concerning
grievances, resignations, and so on.


This trio, after what had occurred at the Congress, undoubtedly meant
legitimising a political and organisational line in one respect
directed against Martov. Undoubtedly. Cause a rupture on that account? Break up
the Party be cause of it? Did not Martov and Plekhanov oppose me over the
question of demonstrations? And did not Martov and I oppose Plekhanov over the
question of the programme? Is not one side of every trio
always up against the other two?


If the majority of the Iskrists, both in the Iskra organisation and at
the Congress, found this particular shade of Martov’s line
organisationally and politically mistaken, is it not really senseless to attempt
to attribute this to “intrigue”, “incitement”, and so
forth? Would it not be senseless to try to talk away this fact by
abusing the Majority and calling them “riffraff”


I repeat that, like the majority of the Iskrists at the Congress, I am
profoundly convinced that the line Martov adopted was wrong, and that he had to
be corrected. To take offence at this correction, to regard it as an insult,
etc., is unreasonable. We have not cast, and are not casting, any
“slurs” on anyone, nor are we excluding anyone from
work. And to cause a split because someone has been excluded from a
central body seems to me a piece of inconceivable folly.


Lenin.

Thanks to Smith for his long letter. Let him write to Yegor, making a last
appeal to reason. Let Zarin go and see Yegor immediately, after obtaining
authority (full authority) to decide matters in Yegor’s countries. Arrange
all this with strict precision. You must act formally and, as regards the
Yegors,[3] you must prepare for a decisive war, and see to it at all
costs that any attempt of theirs to get into the committees meets with a prompt
and vigorous rebuff. You must be on your guard about this and prepare all the
committees. All the Yegors are carrying out and extending the boycott;
they are devilishly embittered, they have dreamed up a heap of imaginary
grievances and insults, they imagine that they are rescuing the Party from
tyrants, they are shouting about this left and right, they are stirring people
up. Their dissension has already deprived us (I don’t know for how long,
possibly even forever) of two of our largest sources of
money. Please make the most desperate efforts to obtain money—that is the
chief thing.


And so, don’t let Smith look on Yegor in the old way. Friendship is at an
end here. Down with all softness! Prepare for the most vigorous resistance,
send Zarin at once, nominate candidates (in the event of
Smith’s
death[1]

)

, and in the same event prepare Smith, too, for a trip
“to
Yegor”,[2]

 appoint members to the
Council,[4]
put everything on a very formal footing and exert yourself to the
utmost. We shall cope with the matter of literature. We are putting strong hopes
on Vadim.

You write: “I have lived too long in the world not to know that in such
cases truth is not on one side alone, but on both sides.” I fully admit
it. The trouble is that the other “side” does not realise the new
situation, the new basis, and demands what used to be easily arrived at (if only
after months of quarrelling), but is now unachievable. The basis has become
different, that is a fait accompli; but they are still guided
chiefly by the offensive turn this or that thing took at the Congress, by the
frenzied way Lenin behaved, etc. I did act frenziedly, there is no denying
it, and I frankly admitted as much in a letter to Old
Believer.[1]

 But the thing is that the results achieved by
“frenzied” struggle are not frenzied at all, yet the other
side in its fight against frenzy goes on fighting against the results
themselves, against the inevitable and necessary results. But you have long been
aware of the direction in which things were going. You know how you expressed
your firm conviction of an obstacle due to certain “old men”, and
you, of course, will not doubt that the ill-fated “trio” is not a
dirty trick, not a Jacobin coup, but a straight forward, natural and the
best, really and truly the best, way out from three years of
“wrangling”. The trio is a triangular construction and there is no
room whatever for wrangling in it. You know what the sensitivity and “personal” (instead of political) attitude of Martov+Old Believer+Zasulich
led to when, for example, they all but

    

“condemned” a man politically for an incident of a purely
personal character. At that time, without a moment’s hesitation, you
sided with the “flayers and monsters”. Yet this is quite a typical
case. Now, too, the root is the same, the same mixing of the personal and the
political, the same suspicion that we want to cast a slur on people
personally, although we only set them aside (or shift them) politically. And
when you remind me: blame must also fall on you, I reply: I would not
think of denying the personal aspect, but that is no reason for demanding a
political correction. The hopelessness, the complete hopelessness, of
the situation lies precisely in the fact that a political correction is being
demanded on account of the sum total of personal grievances, of personal
dissatisfactions with the composition of the central bodies. Tout ce que
vous voulez, mais pas
de \c ca![2]

And if political divergence (as some
desire) should be considered the cause, is it not ridiculous to demand
for the sake of “peace” the co-optation of a larger number, or at
least an equal number, of political opponents? It is ridiculous nec
plus ultra!


The little example quoted by me above out of a large number of cases of
wrangling is typical not only in sub stance but also in the form of the
outcome. Do you know how we won the upper hand at that time? We were in the
minority, but we won by sheer persistence, by threatening to bring
everything into the open. They think they can do the same now. The trouble is
that now is not then. Now the formal basis is
unremovable. If it were not for this formal basis—why
shouldn’t there be six, once people have been roused to fury? We’ve stood
three years of it, we can stand another three; we decided not by votes, but by
persistence, so let us decide by persistence now too. But the thing is—it
can’t be done now. Yet people doggedly refuse to see or
understand this change. And this is what makes the situation so hopeless. Now
the dilemma is inexorable: either the divergence is over the, question
of persons, in which case it is ridiculous to make a political scandal and throw
up work on account of it. Or the divergence is political—and
then it is still more ridiculous to

    

“correct” this by imposing definite persons of a different, shall we
say, nuance.


They are taking (seem to be taking) the second course. In that case, join the
trio, Martov, and prove before the Party the mistakes of the
two in your collegium; unless you participate in the collegium
you cannot obtain data for exposing these mistakes and putting the Party on its
guard against them. Otherwise your accusations are empty
Parteiklatsch[3]

over some future contingency.


If you take the first course, then don’t stretch your resentment to the
extent of throwing up the work, and the work will speedily cause
“frenzy” to be forgotten. There is no more hopeless blind alley than
that of throwing up one’s work.

October 1, 1903


Dear comrades,


We too sincerely regret that a difference of opinion has arisen between the
Odessa Committee and Iskra on the subject of factory
stewards.[1]
Our delay in replying to the letter of the Odessa Committee was due mainly
to the fact that the editors were absent at the time. Generally speaking, the
obstacle in this case (strange as it may seem) was the Second Congress of the
Party.


As regards the essence of the matter, incidentally, a resolution was adopted at
the Congress recommending participation in the election of factory
stewards.


[Quote the text: resolution No. 28.]


This resolution was passed by a huge majority, and we think that matters can be
put right, although it will take time. The Odessa Committee should
immediately disseminate (without publishing) the text of this
resolution among all organised workers and explain it to them. Later,
when the resolution is published, it would be desirable for a leaflet to be
issued over the signature of the Odessa Committee setting out the
Party view on the question and calling on the workers to follow the
tactics approved by the whole Party.


As regards the substance of the matter, we find that constant agitation
in connection with the election of stewards would have a much greater
educational and organising significance than agitation carried out once
only—in connection with refusal to elect. And your own reports, about
patriarchal methods confirm this, pointing to the

    

need for a constant struggle against espionage laws and methods of
spying.


We fully concur with your desire for a more frequent exchange of opinions so as
to avoid differences of opinion and contradictory statements in agitation. Write
more often, not only for the press, and see to it that addresses (for letters to
you) are effective regularly.


We shall try to write a leaflet on the connection between the economic and the
political struggle, if only other work does not interfere.


We are publishing the manifesto of Rabochaya
Volya[2] in
full, as you desired.


Lenin


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The law on factory stewards was passed on June 10, 1903. Lenin dealt in
detail with this law in his article “An Era of Reforms” (see
Vol. 6 of this edition).





[2]
Manifesto of Rabochaya Volya—a declaration by the Odessa
Social-Democratic Union Rabochaya Volya recognising the
correctness of Iskra views and tactics, announcing adherence to
the Odessa Committee of the R.S.D.L.P and closing the Union as a result of
it. The Manifesto was published in Iskra No. 50 for October 15,
1903.

Comrade,


The editorial board of the Central Organ considers it its duty officially to
express its regret at your refusal to participate in Iskra and
Zarya (at present Zarya No. 5 is being prepared for the press). In
spite of the numerous invitations to co-operate which we made immediately after
the Second Party Congress, before Iskra No. 46, and which we repeated
several times after that, we have not received a single literary item from you.


What is more, even the publication of the second edition of your pamphlet
The Red Flag has been held up for many weeks owing to non-delivery of
the end of the manuscript.


The editorial board of the Central Organ states that it considers that your
refusal to co-operate has not been caused by any action on its part.


No element of personal irritation, of course, should be allowed to hinder work
in the Central Organ of the Party.


If, however, your withdrawal is due to any divergence between your views and
ours, we would consider a detailed exposition of such differences extremely
useful in the interests of the Party. Moreover, we would consider it highly
desirable that the nature and extent of these differences should be made clear
to the whole Party as soon as possible through the pages of the publications
edited by us.


Finally, for the sake of the cause, we once again bring to your notice that at
the present time we are ready to co-opt you as a member of the editorial board
of the Central

    

Organ. so as to give you every opportunity to officially state and defend all
your views in the highest Party institution.

October 10, 1903


Dear Leiteisen,


I received your letter and, in accordance with your re quest, I am replying at
once. Whether there will be a congress and when, I do not know. I have heard
that a majority of the three members of the League’s board of management
here pronounced against a congress and that it was decided to invite the opinion
of the two absent members:
you and Vecheslov; thus a settlement of the question has been postponed.


As far as I am concerned, I am personally against a congress. You think that
the League ought to express itself and that a split in it is inevitable in any
case; that two active militant sections would be better than a united inactive
League. The point is, however, that a split in the League is not only
inevitable, but is already an almost accomplished fact; two active
militant sections have already been formed and until a split in the
Party occurs these militant sections will inevitably remain in
the united League. On the other hand, the Party Congress bas completely upset
the whole organisational basis of the League; its old Rules, which are well
known to you, will, of course, in effect cease to exist after the Party
Congress. The League must be renovated and it will, of course, be rebuilt on new
lines by the Central Committee of the Party, which is charged with organising
the Party committees and, in general, all Party institutions.


Consequently, one may say, it is left for the congress
to come together in order to part company. To part company

    

in two senses: in the sense of the mutual recrimination between us and the
Martovites, and in the sense of the liquidation of the old League. Is it worth
while coming together for this purpose? You will not cure
the “split” (or, rather, the sulky withdrawal) in this way, but
only still further embitter the two sides. What is the use of that? What is the
use of a pageant of speeches when it is already almost certain that about
thirty-five of the total forty members of the League have already taken up
their positions?


Is the idea—to stage a “dress rehearsal”? i.e., to see approximately how we shall fight if it comes to a split in the Party? I cannot
deny this significance of a congress, but such a game is not
worth the candle.


The alignment of the remaining five (or about five) members of the League can
be ascertained in a much easier way.


The League’s work abroad will in any case proceed on new lines worked out
by the Party’s Central Committee. A League Congress now will
generate more heat than light, i.e., it will contribute nothing to the work
abroad.


I was very glad to learn that you are coming here and that we shall meet. Let
me know in good time because I am still intending to go away on holiday for
three or four days. I am swamped with work.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin

Dear friend,


I was very pleased to receive your latest news about the plan to take the skin
off[1]

 Deer—it is high time! On the other hand, it is evident from letters
that Deer and Vadim do not have a correct idea of the situation, and that there
is no mutual understanding between us. This is very regrettable (even if Vadim
’s last letter giving advice in the form of an ultimatum is not to be taken
seriously—Stake himself will reply to this, for, I repeat, I find it difficult to take such a thing seriously). Co-optation of Demon, Falcon,
etc., is an erroneous step, in my opinion, for these people lack experience and
self-dependence. The division of functions, too, is very dangerous, for it
threatens to produce fragmentation. Meanwhile the committees continue to be
neglected: in Kiev people are behaving foolishly and, strange to relate,
neither Andreyevsky, nor Dyadin, nor Lebedev, have gone into the committees to
fight. Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav, Don, and Gornozavodsky, too, are in the hands of
the
mutineers.[2]

Positions must be occupied everywhere by our people at all
costs. We must get at least one of our people, one who is wholly ours, on every
committee without fail. The Caucasus is beginning to be stirred
up[3]—there, too, they need our people’s help. More
important than a division of functions is for seats in each committee to be
occupied by our agents, and then for all efforts to be devoted to transport and
delivery.

 

When all is said and done, the most important thing, and our whole strength,
lies in transport. We should not be content with one route alone, but have two
or three, so as to put a stop to the continual interruptions.


It is extremely important to issue the
announcement[4] as soon as
possible, to issue it in Russia and distribute it everywhere. For heaven’s
sake, hurry up with this and write to us about it quickly and precisely. Brutus
should be formally elected to the Council and his vote formally transferred to
Stake. This is a matter that brooks no delay.


In my view, it is extremely important that Deer should be sent here if only for
a couple of weeks, or even a week. This would be very, very useful, giving a
view of every thing à vol d’oiseau, enabling him to see the source of
ferment and to achieve full mutual understanding. Surely, no one can grudge a
mere 200 rubles and two or three weeks for the sake of this! Surely a legal
foreign passport could be found for Deer! Think this over carefully. I strongly
recommend this step, which is especially convenient in connection with
Deer’s plans. Truly, without having reached full agreement it is difficult
to keep in step. And Deer’s talk of “moral influence on the Old
Man” shows (please don’t take offence!) the utmost lack of mutual
under standing. Why doesn’t Deer write anything about this? The
plan of co-opting Martov is simply ridiculous; it shows such a lack of
understanding that there are certain to be instances when you will get into a
mess, and with a scandal at that. No really, I can’t even speak seriously
about your co-opting Martov; if you have been thinking of it seriously, then we
speak different tongues! We have all (including Stake) laughed until we cried
over this “plan”!!

Dear comrades,


We have had news of your affairs both from Ruben in person and from
Rashid-Bek by letter. We can only welcome your decision to remove
Isari[1] temporarily, until the matter is examined by the Central
Committee. The sum total of information concerning his behaviour at the Congress certainly points against him. The Congress showed his utter instability;
after some waverings, Isari, nevertheless, at the decisive moment voted with
the Majority and helped to secure adoption of the present composition of the
editorial board of the Central Organ and of the Central Committee. But
afterwards Isari suddenly went over to the other side, and is now fighting
against the decisions of the Majority by methods that are hardly loyal! It’s
simply disgusting! Such a leader is not worthy of political trust. In any case,
he should be treated with caution, to say the least, and should not be given any
responsible posts—such is our deep conviction, both mine (Lenin’s) and
Plekhanov’s.


Let the Caucasian comrades hold firmly to the course they have adopted. Let them
turn a deaf ear to the slander against the Majority. The full minutes of the
Congress will soon see the light of day and then things will be clear to
all. Let them carry on their good teamwork with comradely faith in the Central
Committee, and we are sure that the present “dissension” in the
Party will be rapidly dispelled.


We are giving much thought now to the idea of organising here the publication of
Georgian and Armenian litera-

    

ture. Competent comrades have taken this in hand, and we hope to raise the
money. We need both literary and financial help.


We send greetings to the Caucasian comrades and ardent
wishes for success in their work.


Lenin. Plekhanov

Committee. The first two adhered to the Majority (Bolsheviks) at the
Congress and after it, while the latter wavered at the Congress and
afterwards supported the Minority (Mensheviks).

Comrades,


We have received your letter with the
resolution.[1] We earnestly
request you to write to us on the following:
1) Have you heard reports from both the Minority and the Majority (one of
your
delegates, as you probably know, was on the side of the Majority), or
only from
the Minority?
2) What do you mean by the word “departure”? Departure—where
to? Do you mean by this that someone has been removed from work, or
has removed himself, for some reason or other, and for what reasons
precisely?
3) What is it you call “abnormal conditions at elections”?
4) Who exactly, in your opinion, should be co-opted on to the Central Committee? and
5) who
exactly on to the editorial board of the Central Organ?

Comrades,


We have received your
resolution[2] and ask you to reply to the following
questions. Please discuss them at a general meeting of all the members of the
Committee (or send them to all the members, if they are not together) as an
enquiry from the editorial board of the Party’s Central Organ.


1) Has the Committee heard a report from the representative of
the Majority at the Party Congress?


2) Does the Committee consider it normal to pass a re solution appraising the
activities and decisions of the Congress before the minutes have been
issued, and even before the Committee has enquired of the Central Committee
or members of the Majority about matters which are not clear to it?


3) How could these disagreements on organisational questions destroy
   everything previously done by Iskra and the Organising Committee?
   How did the destruction manifest itself? What exactly was
   destroyed? We are not at all clear on this, and if you want to safeguard the
   Central Organ from any kind of error, it is your duty to explain to us what
   you regard as our error. Set the matter out in full detail and we shall
   carefully discuss your opinion.


4) What exactly are the “sharp disagreements on
organisational questions”? We do not know. (We asked Martov and the former
members of Iskra’s editorial board to expound these
disagreements in the pages of the publications edited by us, but so far
our request has not been complied
with.[1]

 

5) In what do you see the atmosphere of political intrigue and distrust? On the
   part of whom? Be more explicit. (If we distrusted Martov we would
   not have invited him to work in Iskra.)


6) If there really are “sharp disagreements on organisational questions” between us and the former editors, how can the two of us
co-opt the four of them? That surely would mean making their tendency
the dominant one? But the Congress pronounced in our favour,
didn’t it? What you want, therefore, is that the decision of the Congress
should be revised on the basis of a private agreement.


7) Do you consider it normal that by threats of a split,
boycott, etc., people should want to make Party officials (editors of the
Central Organ, and the Central Committee) do something that these central bodies
do not consider useful in the interests of the Party?


8) Do you consider it normal and permissible that Party members who have been
   left in a minority should abstain from work in the Central Organ, from
   supporting the central Committee and obeying it, from helping the Party
   financially, and so forth?

November 1, 1903


Dear Georgi Valentinovich,


I am quite unable to calm down on account of the questions that are
worrying us. This delay, this postponement of a decision, is simply dreadful, a
torture....


No, really, I can quite understand your motives and considerations in favour of
a concession to the Martovites. But I am deeply convinced that a concession at
the present time is the most desperate step, leading to a storm and a shindy
far more certainly than would war against the Martovites. This is no
paradox. I not only did not persuade Kurtz to leave but, on the contrary, tried
to persuade him to stay, but he (and Ru) flatly refuses now to work with the
Martovite editorial board. What’s going to happen? In Russia, dozens of
delegates have been travelling all over; even from Nizhni-Novgorod they write
that much has been done by the C.C., transport has been arranged, agents have
been appointed, the announcement is being published, Sokolovsky in the
West, Berg in the centre, and Zemlyachka and lots of others, have all settled
down to work. And now comes the refusal of Kurtz. It means a long break
(in the session and meeting of the whole C.C., now, it seems, already
considerably enlarged). Afterwards, either a struggle of the C.C. against
the Martovite editorial board or the resignation of the whole C.C. Then
you+two Martovites in the Council must co-opt a new C.C., and this
without election by the Congress, with total disapproval on the part of the
great bulk in Russia, and bewilderment, dis content and refusal on the
part of these agents who have already gone out. Why, this will utterly
discredit the Congress

    

and sow complete discord and cause a scandal in Russia a hundred
thousand times more terrible and dangerous than a scurrilous foreign pamphlet.


We are fed up with discord! That is what they write and scream about in
letters from Russia. And to give way to the Martovites now would mean
legitimising discord in Russia, for in Russia there has not
yet been even a trace of disobedience and revolt. No statements of yours or
mine will now restrain the delegates of the Majority at the Party
Congress. These delegates will create a frightful rumpus.


For the sake of unity, for the sake of the stability of the Party—do
not take this responsibility upon yourself, do not withdraw and do not give
everything away to the Martovites.


Yours,

N. Lenin

Dear friend,


You cannot imagine what is going on here—it’s simply disgusting—and
I beg you to do everything possible and impossible to come here together
with Boris, after obtaining the votes of the others. You know that I am now
fairly experienced in Party matters, and I categorically declare that any
postponement, the slightest delay or vacillation, will spell ruin to the
Party. You will probably be told about everything in detail. The gist of it is
that Plekhanov has suddenly changed front, after the rows at the. League Congress,[1] and has thereby cruelly and shamefully let down
me, Kurtz and all of us. Now he has gone, without us, to haggle with the
Martovites who, seeing that he was frightened of a split, double and quadruple
their demands. They demand not only the Six, but also the entry of their people
into the C.C. (they do not say as yet how many and whom) and of two of them into
the Council, and a disavowal of the activities of the C.C. in the League
(activities carried out with the full agreement of Plekhanov). Plekhanov was
pitifully scared of a split and a struggle! The situation is desperate, our
enemies are rejoicing and have grown insolent, all our people are
furious. Plekhanov is threatening to throw the whole thing up immediately and,
is capable of doing so. I repeat, your coming is essential at all
costs.

Their conditions are:
1) co-optation of four on to the editorial board;
2) co-optation? on to the C.C.;
3) recognition of the lawfulness of the League;
4) two votes in the Council. I would propose that the C.C. put the
following conditions to them:
1) co-optation of three on to the editorial board;
2) status quo ante bellum in the League;
3) one
vote in the Council. Next I would propose endorsing at once (but for the time
being without communicating it to the contending side) the following
ultimatum:
1) co-optation of four on to the editorial board;
2)
co-optation of two on to the C.C. at the discretion of the C.C.;
3) status
quo ante bellum in the League;
4one vote in The Council. If the
ultimatum is not accepted—war to the bitter end. An additional condition:
5) cessation of all gossip, wrangling and talk concerning the strife at the
Second Party Congress and after it.


For my part, I may add that I am resigning from the editorial board and can
remain only in the Central Committee. I shall go the whole hog and
publish a booklet about the struggle of the hysterical scandalmongers or
discarded
ministers.[1]

November 5


1) Yesterday Lalayants set out to visit you.


2) I already wrote yesterday about the row here and that Plekhanov has taken
fright and entered into negotiations with
them.[1]

They put forward the
   conditions:
1) restoration of the old editorial board,
2)
   co-optation of several persons, on to the Central Committee,
3) two votes in
   the Council,
4) recognition of the League Congress as lawful. In other words,
   they agree to peace only on condition of complete surrender of the position,
   disavowal of Wolf and rendering the present Central Committee
   “harmless”. My personal opinion is that any concessions on the
   part of the C.C. would be degrading and would completely discredit the
   present Central Committee. It is necessary that Deer and Nil come here as
   soon as possible, everything is at stake—and if the C.C. is not
   prepared for a determined struggle, a fight to the bitter end, it would be
   best to give up everything to them at once. To permit such demoralisation,
   to enter into such deals, means to ruin everything. I repeat, that is my
   personal opinion. In any case, come here at once so that we may jointly
   decide what to do.

November 6, 1903


Georgi Valentinovich,


I have given much thought to your statement of yesterday that
you will reserve for yourself “full freedom of action” if I do not
agree to advise Konyagin to resign from the Party Council. I am quite unable to
agree to this. Nor do I consider it possible to remain any longer in the unofficial position of de facto editor in spite of my resignation, since
you say that full freedom of action as understood by you does not exclude your
handing over the editorial board to the Martovites. I am compelled, therefore,
to hand over to you all the official contacts of the editorial board of the
Central Organ and all documents, which I am sending you under special cover. If
any explanations are required in regard to the documents, I shall, of course,
willingly give them. Some of the material has been given to contributors
(Lebedev, Schwarz, Ruben), who will have to be told of everything being
transferred to you.


N. Lenin



P.S. Please do not interpret the turnover of the editorial board in the sense of
the notorious boycott. That would contradict what I said plainly in my statement
to you of November 1 of this
year.[1] I shall now, of course, bring
my resignation from the editorial board to the knowledge of the comrades.


P.P.S. I am sending (tomorrow morning by messenger) three packets—aa, bb,
cc—according to the importance of the material.

 

Issue No. 52 was to have been put out on November 16 with the announcement of
the Central
Committee.[2] For this the printing should begin on
Monday; it will be all right even beginning it on Tuesday.

November 8, 1903. To Smith


Dear friend,


Once more I earnestly beg you to come here, you in particular, and another one
or two persons from the Central Committee. This is absolutely and immediately
necessary. Plekhanov has betrayed us, there is terrible bitterness in our camp;
all are indignant that, because of the rows in the League, Plekhanov has allowed
the decisions of the Party Congress to be revised. I have definitely resigned
from the editorial board. Iskra may come to a stop. The crisis is
complete and terrible. Bear in mind that I am not fighting now for the editorial
board of the Central Organ, I am quite reconciled to Plekhanov setting up a
five-man board without me. But I am fighting for the C.C. which the Martovites,
who have grown insolent after Plekhanov’s cowardly betrayal, also want to
seize; they are demanding the co-optation on to it of their own people without
even saying how many! The fight for the editorial board of the Central Organ has
been irretrievably lost owing to Plekhanov’s treachery. The sole chance
of peace lies in trying to give them the editorial board of the C.O. while
holding on to the C.C. ourselves.


This is not at all easy (even this may be too late already),
but we must try. We need Smith here, and, best of all two
more Russians from the C.C., the most imposing (no ladies)
(e.g., Boris and Doctor). Plekhanov threatens to resign if the C.C. does not
yield. For heaven’s sake, don’t believe in his threats; we must use
more pressure on him, scare him. Russia must stand up firmly for the C.C. and
content itself with handing over the editorial board of the C.O.

    

New people from the C.C. are needed here, otherwise there is absolutely no one
to conduct negotiations with the Martovites. Smith is triply needed. I repeat
the Martovites’ “conditions”: I) negotiations on behalf of the
editorial board of the C.O., and the C.C., 2) six on the editorial board of the
C.O., 3)? on the C.C. Cessation of co-optation on to the C.C., 4) two seats in
the Council, 5) disavowal of the C.C. as regards the League, recognition of the
latter’s Congress as lawful. These are indeed peace terms put by victors
to the vanquished!

November 1O, 1903[1]


Dear Lidin,


I should like to give you our “political news”.


To begin with, here is a chronology of recent events. Wednesday (October 27 or
28?) was the third day of the League Congress. Martov yelled hysterically about
“the blood of the old editorial board” (Plekhanov’s
expression) being upon us, and that on the part of Lenin there was something in
the nature of intrigue at the Congress, etc. I calmly challenged him in writing
(by a statement to the bureau of the
Congress[2]

) to make his accusations against
me openly before the whole Party; I would undertake to publish
everything. Otherwise, I said, it was mere
Skandalsucht.[3]

Martov, of course, “nobly withdrew”, demanding (as he still does) a
court of arbitration; I continued to demand that he should have the courage to
make his accusations openly, otherwise I would ignore it all as
pitiful tittle-tattle.


Plekhanov refused to speak in view of Martov’s discreditable
behaviour. Some dozen of our people submitted a statement to the Congress
bureau, branding Martov’s “discreditable behaviour” in
reducing the dispute to the level of squabbling, suspicions, etc. I would remark
in parenthesis that my two hours’ speech about “Comrade Martov’s histor-

    

ical
turn”[4]

at the Party Congress towards
Versumpfung[5]

did not evoke even from the Martovites a
single protest about the issue being reduced to the level of
squabbling.


Friday. We decided to introduce eleven new members into the League. In the
evening at a private meeting with these “grenadiers” (as we
jokingly called them), Plekhanov rehearsed all the steps by which we
should utterly rout the Martovites. A stage scene. Thunderous applause.


Saturday. The C.C. read its statement about n6t endorsing the League’s
Rules and about the meeting being unlawful (a statement previously discussed
with Plekhanov in all details, word by word). All our people walked out amid the
Martovites’ cries of “gendarmes” and so forth.


Saturday evening. Plekhanov. “surrendered”. He did not want a
split. He demanded the opening of peace negotiations.


Sunday (November 1). I tendered my resignation in writing to Plekhanov (not
wishing to be a party to such depravity as the revision of the Party Congress
under the influence of a row adroad; to say nothing of the fact that from the
purely strategical aspect a more stupid moment I or concessions could not have
been
chosen).[6]


November 3. Old Believer gave Plekhanov, who began the negotiations, a written
statement of the conditions of peace with the opposition:
1) Negotiations to be
con ducted by the editorial board of the C.O. and by the C.C.
2) Restoration of the old editorial board of Iskra.
3) Co optation on
to the C.C., the number to be decided during the negotiations. Cessation of
   co-optation on to the C.C. from the moment negotiations begin.
4) Two
   seats (sic!) on the Party Council and
5) recognition of the lawfulness
   of the League Congress.


Plekhanov was not put out. He demanded that the C.C. give way (!). The
C.C. refused and wrote to Russia. Plekhanov declared that he would resign if
the C.C. did not give way. I turned over to Plekhanov (November 6) all
editorial matters, convinced that Plekhanov was capable

    

of surrendering to the Martovites not merely the newspaper but the entire
C.C. for
nothing.[7]


The state of affairs: Iskra would hardly come out on time. The
Martovites were rejoicing over their “victory”. All our people
(except the two Axelrod
maids,[14] who are faithful to Plekhanov even
in his
Treulosigkeit[8]

dissociated themselves from Plekhanov and at a
meeting (November 6 or 7) told him some home truths (on the subject of the
“second Isari”).


A pretty picture, is it not? I shall not join the editorial board,
but I shall write. Our people want to defend the C.C., insofar as that is
possible, and to continue an intensified agitation against the
Martovites—the right plan, in my opinion.


Let Plekhanov leave us; the Party Council will then turn over Iskra to
a committee and convene an Extraordinary Party Congress. Do you mean to say
the League Abroad will be allowed by a majority of three or four votes to
revise the Party Congress? Do you mean to say it is proper, after
carrying the fight to the lengths of the greatest publicity and almost a
rupture, to sound the retreat and accept peace terms dictated by the Martovites?


I should like to know your opinion.


I think that to act à la Plekhanov means subverting
the Party Congress and betraying its majority. I think that we must agitate with
all our strength here and in Russia for subordination to the Party Congress and
not to the League Congress.


A boycott of Iskra (even a Martovite Iskra) is, of course,
stupid. Moreover it would be a boycott not of a Martovite but, possibly, of a
Plekhanovite Iskra, for Zasulich and Axelrod will soon give Plekhanov
three votes in the Five. And that’s called an editorial hoard! As an
illustration to your witty remark about the saintly relics of Sarovsky, I will
quote the following statistical item: in the 45 issues of Iskra under
six editors, there were 39 articles and feuilletons written by
Martov, 32 by me, 24 by Plekhanov, 8 by Old Believer, 6 by Zasulich, and 4 by
P. B. Axelrod. This

    

in the course of three years! Not a single issue was made up (in the
sense of technical editorial work) by anyone other than Martov or myself. And
now—as a reward for the row, as a reward for Old Believer cutting off an
important source of finance—they are to be taken on to the editorial
board! They fought over “differences of principle”, which, in Old
Believer’s letter of November 3 to Plekhanov were so expressively
converted into figuring out how many seats they needed. And we have to
legitimise this fight for seats, to make a deal with this party of discarded
generals or ministers (grève générale
des généraux,[9]

as Plekhanov
said) or with the party of hysterical brawlers! What’s the use of Party
congresses if things are done by nepotism abroad, by hysteria and brawling?


Further about the notorious “trio”, which the hysterical Martov sees
as the pivot of my “intriguing”. You probably remember from as far
back as the time of the Congress my programme for the Congress and my commentary
on this programme. I should very much like all Party members to know this
document, and so once again I quote it for you precisely. “Item 23
(Tagesordnung[10]

). Election of the Central Committee and the editorial board
of the Central Organ of the Party.


My commentary: “The Congress shall elect three persons to the
editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the Central
Committee. These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt
by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the
C.O. and to the C.C., and report to this effect to the Congress. After the
report has been endorsed by the Congress, subsequent co-optation shall be
effected by the editorial board of the C.O. and by the C.C. separately.”


Is it not clear that this means renewal of the editorial board, a thing
which cannot be done without the consent of the C.C. (four out
of six are necessary for co-optation), while the question of enlarging the
original trio or leaving it as it was is left open (co-optation
“if necessary”)? I showed this draft to everyone
(including Plekhanov, of course)

    

prior to the Congress. Of course, renewal was necessary owing to dissatisfaction
with the Six (and especially with Plekhanov, who in fact had the votes of
P. B. Axelrod, who almost never took part, and of the pliable V. I. Zasulich),
and, of course, in a private conversation with Martov, I sharply
expressed this dissatisfaction, “scolded” all three—Plekhanov
(especially) and Axelrod and Zasulich—for their caprices, and proposed
even enlarging the Six to Seven, etc. Is it not hysteria to give a twist now to
these private conversations and raise a howl that “the trio was aimed
against Plekhanov” and that I had laid a “trap” for Martov,
and so forth? Of course, when we agreed with Martov, the trio would be against
Plekhanov, and when Plekhanov agreed with Martov (on the subject of demonstration, for example) then the trio would be against me, and so on. The
hysterical howling merely covers up a pitiful incapacity to understand that the
editorial board must have real, and not fictitious, editors, that it must be a
business-like and not a philistine collegium, and that each of its
members should have his own opinion on each question (which
was never the case with the unelected trio).


Martov approved my plan of two trios, but when it turned out to be
against him in one question, he went into a fit of hysteria and began
to howl about intrigue! It was not for nothing that in the corridors of the
League Congress Plekhanov called him a “pitiful person”!


Yes ... the dirty squabble abroad—that is what over ruled the decision of
the majority of Russian Party workers. Plekhanov’s betrayal, too, was
partly due to fear of a row abroad, and partly to a feeling (perhaps)
that in the Five he was sure to have three votes....


A fight for the C.C., for a new congress to be held soon (in the
summer)—that is what is left to us.



Get hold of my
notebook.[11]

It was sent by Poletayev (Bauman) to Vecheslov
alone and personally. Shergov could have taken it only by trickery,
only by a breach of trust.

    

Read it to anyone you like, but don’t let anyone have It, and return it
to me.


You must oust Vecheslov from all positions. Take a letter for yourself from
the C.C., tell the
Parteivorstand[12]

that you are the agent of the
C.C., and take all German contacts wholly into
your hands.


I owe you an apology about your pamphlet. I have only managed to read it
through once. It needs revising, but I have not had time to map out the
revision.


Yours,

Lenin

November 18, 1903


Georgi Valentinovich,


I am sorry that I am a day late with my
article[1]

; I was not well yesterday and
in general the work is going terribly hard these last few days.


The article turned out longer than I thought and had to be divided into two
parts; in the second part I shall make a detailed analysis of Novobrantsev and
draw conclusions.


I consider that my article should have a signature and so I am taking a
pseudonym, otherwise, pending the announcement, it will probably be
inconvenient for you.


Will you please also insert my
statement[2]

appended herewith in the issue of
Iskra containing the announcement about the Congress. Of course, in the
event of complete peace being established in the Party (which I am hoping for)
and if you were to find it necessary, I could, among other peace terms, discuss
also the non-publication of this statement.


Yours sincerely,


N. Lenin

Dear friends,


The new political situation was fully clarified after the publication of
Iskra No. 53. It is clear that the Five in the Central Organ are out to
hound both Lenin (even going so far as slander about his having expelled the
Yuzhny Rabochy people from the Party and vile hints about
Schweitzer[1]) and the C.C., and the Majority as a whole, Plekhanov
says bluntly that the Five on the C.O. are not afraid of any Central
Committee. The C.C. is being attacked both here and in Russia (letter from
St. Petersburg about Martyn’s journey). The issue squarely faces us. If
time is lost and we fail to give the watchword for the struggle,
complete defeat is inevitable owing, firstly, to the desperate
struggle of the Iskra Five and, secondly, to the arrests of our
people in Russia. The only salvation is—a congress. Its watchword: the
fight against disrupters. Only by this watchword can we catch out the
Martovites, win over the broad masses and save the situation. In my opinion, the
only possible plan is this: for the time being not a word about the
congress, complete secrecy. All, absolutely all, forces to be
sent into the committees and on tours. A light to be waged for peace,
for putting a stop to disruption, for sub ordination to the Central
Committee. Every effort to be made to strengthen the committees with our
people. Every effort to be made to catch out the Martovites and Yuzhny
Rabochy people in disruption, pin them down by documents and resolutions
against the disrupters; resolutions of the committees should p our into the
Central Organ. Further, our people should be got into the wavering
committees. Winning over the committees with the watchword: against

    

disruption—this is the most important task. The congress must
be held not later than January, therefore set to work energetically; we,
too, shall put all forces into operation. The object of the congress is to
strengthen the C.C. and the Council, and perhaps the C.O. as well, either by
a trio (in the event of our being able to tear Plekhanov away, which is not very
likely), or by a Six, which I would join in the event of a peace that
is honourable for us. At the worst: their C.O., our C.C. and Council.


I repeat: either complete defeat (the C.O. will hound us) or
immediate preparation for a congress. It must be prepared secretly at
first during a maximum of one month, after which during three weeks the
demands of half the committees to be collected and the congress
convened. Again and yet again—this is the only salvation,

December 12, 1903


I, as representative of the C.C., received today from Comrade Martov an inquiry
as to whether a report on the negotiations of the C.C. with the Geneva
opposition could be published or
not.[2] I believe it could, and I
earnestly request the comrades on the editorial board of the C.O. to consider
once again the question of peace and good will in the Party.


It is not too late yet to secure such a peace, it is not too late yet to keep
from our people and our enemies the details of the split and the speeches about
dishonourable conduct and falsified lists, speeches which will probably be
utilised even by Moskovskiye
Vedomosti.[3] I can guarantee
that the Majority will readily agree to consign all this dirt to oblivion,
provided peace and good will in the Party are secured.


Everything now depends on the editorial board of the C.O., which includes
representatives of the former opposition that rejected the C.C.’s peace
proposal of November 25,
1903.[4] I ask you, comrades, to take into
consideration that since then the C.C. has already made two further voluntary
concessions, by advising Comrade Ru to hand in his resignation and by trying to
settle the League affair “amicably”.


Meanwhile the boycott of the C.C., the agitation against it and the disruption
of practical work in Russia continue. People write to us from Russia that the
opposition are making a “hell” there. We have the most definite
information that the agents of the Minority are systematically

    

continuing their disruptive work, making a round of the committees. People in
St. Petersburg write about Martyn’s visit there with the same aim. Things
have reached a point when the opposition are making their own transport arrangements and, through Dan, are offering the C.C. to share them on a fifty-fifty
basis!


I consider it my duty to the Party to ask the editorial board of the C.O. for
the last time that it persuade the opposition to subscribe to peace and good
will on the basis of a sincere recognition of the two central bodies by both
sides and cessation of the intestine war which renders any joint work
impossible.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter for F. V. Lengnik, the representative of the
Central Committee abroad.





[2]
This refers to the C.C.’s negotiations with the Mensheviks concerning the
situation which arose within the Party after the Second Congress.





[3]
Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder)—one of the oldest
Russian newspapers, originally issued (in 1756) as a small sheet by Moscow
University. In 1863 it became a monarcho-nationalist mouthpiece reflecting
the views of the most reactionary sections of the landowners and the
clergy. From 1905 onwards was one of the leading organs of the Black
Hundreds. Continued to appear until the October Socialist Revolution in
1917.





[4]
The reference is to the Central Committee’s ultimatum presented to the
Mensheviks on November 25, 1903, the chief points of which were set forth
by Lenin in his letter to the C.C. dated November 4, 1903.

With strong support from Plekhanov, who, the very next day after the
ultimatum, co-opted all the old editors to the editorial board of the
Central Organ, the Mensheviks rejected the C.C.’s ultimatum and declared
open war against the Majority of the Party.


An appraisal of the C.C.’s ultimatum was given by Lenin in his book One
Step Forward, Two Steps Back (see ^^Vol. 7^^ of this edition).

Dear friend,


It is essential that we clear up in all details a question on which we
apparently differ, and I beg you to forward this letter of mine for discussion
by all members of the C.C. (or its Executive
Committee[2]). The
difference is this:
1) you think that peace with the Martovites is possible
(Boris even congratulates us on peace! It is both comic and tragic!);
2) you
think that an immediate congress is an acknowledgement of our impotence. I am
convinced that on both points you are cruelly mistaken.
1) The Martovites are
heading for war. At the meeting in Geneva, Martov bluntly shouted: “We are
a force.” They vilify us in their newspaper and basely sidetrack the
issue, covering up their trickery by yelling about bureaucracy on your part. On
every hand Martov continues to clamour about the C.C. being absolutely
ineffective. In short, it is native and quite impermissible to doubt that the
Martovites are out to seize the C.C. as well by the same methods of trickery,
boycott and brawling. A fight with them on this level is beyond our strength,
for the C.O. is a powerful weapon and our defeat is inevitable, especially in
view of the arrests. By letting the time slip by you are heading for the
certain and complete defeat of the entire Majority, you are silently swallowing
the insults which the C.C. is suffering abroad (at the hands of the League) and
asking for more.
2) A congress will demonstrate our strength, will prove that not merely in words
but in fact we shall not permit a clique of brawlers abroad to boss the whole
   movement. It is now that a congress is needed, when the watchword is: the
   fight against disruption. Only this watchward justifies

    

a congress, and justifies it completely In the eyes of Russia as a
whole. By losing this opportunity, you lose this watchword and prove your
impotent, passive subordination to the Martovites. To dream of strengthening our
positions by positive work in face of the attacks on the part of the C.O. and
the Martovites’ boycott and agitation is simply ludicrous. It means slowly
perishing in an inglorious struggle against the intriguers, who will say
afterwards (and are already saying): see how ineffective this Central Committee
is! I repeat, don’t harbour any illusions. Either you dictate peace to the
Martovites at a congress, or they will kick you out ingloriously or replace you
at the first setback caused by arrests. The congress now has an aim, namely: to
put an end to the intolerable disruption, to sweep away the League, which
flaunts every and any C.C., to take the Council firmly into its hands and put
the Central Organ in order. How to put it in order? At worst by leaving
even the Five (or by restoring the Six); but this worst event is improbable if
we get a big majority. Then we shall either rout the Martovites completely
(Plekhanov is beginning to talk of a new Vademecum, seeing
that there is no peace, and is threatening to attack both contending
sides. That’s just what we want!), or we shall say frankly that we have no
guiding C.O. and we shall convert it into an organ for discussion, with freedom
for signed articles of the Majority and the Minority (or even better: relegate
the polemic with the Martovites to pamphlets, and in Iskra fight only
against the government and the enemies of Social-Democracy).


And so, abandon the naïve hope of working peacefully in such an impossible
atmosphere. Send all the main forces out on tours, let Deer travel,
secure immediately the absolute support of your own committees, then
launch an attack on those of the others, and—a congress, a congress not
later than January!


P.S. If Martov asks Deer concerning
publication[3]—let
Deer without fail transfer his vote to Stake; without fail, otherwise there will
be an arch-scandal! When Martov and Dan speak to Stake at rendezvous they treat
him with intolerable insolence!


P.P.S. Today, 18th, another dirty trick of the Martovites: their refusal to
publish in No. 54 my letter on why

    

I resigned from the editorial
board,[1]

on the pretext that Hans was against
publication of documents (they have become inveterate liars! Hans was against it
provided there was peace!). The refusal is accompanied by a heap of dis
gusting statements, such as that the C.C. has been trying to lay hands on the
C.O., that negotiations have gone on for restoring confidence in the C.C., and
so on. The tactic is clear: hypocritically to disguise the opposition of the
Dans, Martyns, etc., to the C.C. and on the sly to fling mud at the C.C. in the
newspaper. On no account shall I leave the vile No. 53 unanswered. Wire
immediately:
1) do you agree to the publication of my letter outside Iskra? 203
shares;
2) do you agree to devote all efforts immediately to the congress? 204
shares. If the answer to both questions is “yes”, then wire: 407
shares. If it is “no” to both, then 45 shares.


The day after tomorrow I shall send you my letter of resignation from the
editorial board. If you do not agree to an immediate congress and intend to
suffer Martov’s Insults without saying anything, then I shall probably
have to resign from the Central Committee as well.

Dear comrade,


I was very glad to have your letter because here abroad we have too little
opportunity of hearing the frank and independent voices of those engaged in
local activities. For a Social-Democratic writer living abroad it is extremely
important to have a frequent exchange of opinions with advanced workers who are
active in Russia, and your account of the impact our dissensions have upon the
committees interested me very much. I shall, perhaps, even publish your letter
if the occasion
offers.[5]


It is impossible to answer your questions in a single letter, since a detailed
account of the Majority and the Minority would take up a whole book. I have now
published in leaflet form my “Letter to the Editors of Iskra (Why
I Resigned From the Iskra Editorial
Board),”[1]

where I give a
brief account of the reasons why we parted company and try to show how the
matter is misrepresented in Iskra No. 53 (beginning with No. 53, the
editorial board consists of four representatives of the Minority in addition to
Plekhanov). I hope that this letter (a small printed sheet of eight pages) will
soon be in your hands, because it has already been taken to Russia and it will
probably not to difficult to distribute it.


I repeat: in this letter the matter is set out very briefly. It cannot at
present be set out in greater detail until the minutes of the Party Congress and
of the League Congress have been issued (it is announced in Iskra
No. 53 that the minutes of both these congresses will be published in full

    

very soon. I have information that the minutes of the Party Congress will be
issued as a book of over three hundred pages; nearly 300 pages are now ready and
the book will probably come out in a week or two at the latest). Most probably
a
pamphlet[2]

will have to be written when the two sets of minutes are
published.


My personal view of the matter is that the split is primarily and mainly due to
dissatisfaction with the composition of the central bodies (the Central Organ
and the Central Committee). The Minority wanted to keep the old six-man board of
the C.O., but the Congress selected three of the six, apparently finding them
better suited for political leadership. The Minority was similarly defeated
over the composition of the Central Committee, that is to say, the Congress did
not elect those whom the Minority wanted.


In consequence of this the dissatisfied Minority began exaggerating minor
differences of opinion, boycotting the central bodies, mustering its supporters
and even preparing to split the Party (very persistent and, probably, trust
worthy rumours are current here that they have already decided to found, and
have begun to set up, their own newspaper to be called
Kramola.[3]

No
wonder the feuilleton in Iskra No. 53 has been set up in a
type which does not exist at all in the Party print-shop!).


Plekhanov decided to co-opt them on to the editorial board to avoid a split, and
wrote the article “What Should Not Be Done” in Iskra
No. 52. After No. 51, I resigned from the editorial board, for I considered this
modification of the congress under the influence of the rows taking place abroad
to be incorrect. But personally, of course, I did not want to prevent peace if
peace were possible, and therefore (since now I do not consider it
possible for me to work in the Six) I withdrew from the editorial board,
without, however, refusing to contribute.


The Minority (or opposition) wants to force its people into the Central
Committee too. For the sake of peace, the C.C. agreed to take two of them, but
the Minority is still not satisfied and continues to spread vile rumours about

    

the C.C. being ineffectual. In my opinion, that is the most outrageous
violation of discipline and Party duty. More over, it is sheer slander, for the
C.C. was elected by the Congress from persons for whom the majority of
the Iskra organisation had expressed support. And the Iskra
organisation, of course, knew better than anyone else who was fitted for this
important role. A Central Committee of three
persons[6] was elected at
the Congress—all three long-standing members of the Iskra
organisation; two of them were members of the Organising Committee; the third
had been invited to serve on the O.C. but did not do so because he was
personally unwilling, yet for a long time he worked for the O.C. on general
Party matters. It follows that the most reliable and experienced persons were
elected to the C.C. and I consider it a shabby trick to shout about their
“ineffectiveness”, when it is the Minority itself that
hinders the C.C. from working. All the charged against the C.C. (about
formalism, bureaucracy, and so forth) are nothing but malicious inventions
devoid of any foundation.


It goes without saying that I fully share your opiniom as to the unseemliness of
an outcry against centralism and against the congress on the part of people who
previously spoke in a different tone and who are dissatisfied because on one
particular issue the congress did not do what they wanted. Instead of admitting
their mistake, these people are now disrupting the Party! I believe, the
comrades in Russia should vigorously oppose, all disruption and insist that the
congress decisions be implemented and prevent the squabble about who should be
on the C.O. and the C.C. from hindering the work. The squabbles abroad among the
writers and all the other generals (whom you too harshly and bluntly call
intriguers) will cease to be dangerous to the Party only when the leaders of
committees in Russia become more independent and capable of firmly demanding
the fulfilment of what their delegates decide at the Party congress.


Concerning the relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee,
you are quite right that neither the one nor the other should be given the upper
hand once for all. The congress itself, I think, should make a separate

    

decision on each occasion. At present, too, according to the Rules, the Party
Council stands above both the C.O. and the C.C. And the Council has two members
from the C.O. and two from the C.C., the fifth member having been elected by the
congress. Hence the congress itself has decided who should be given the upper
hand on this occasion. Stories about us wanting the C.O. abroad to overrule the
C.C. in Russia are sheer gossip in which there is not a word of truth. When
Plekhanov and I were on the editorial board we had even in the Council
three Social-Democrats from Russia and only two from
abroad. Now, under the Martovites, the reverse is the case! Now judge for
yourself what their talk is worth!


I send you warm greetings and earnestly request you to let me know whether you
received this letter, whether you have read my letter to the editorial board and
Nos. 52, 53 of Iskra, and how in general things are now in the Committee.


With comradely greetings,


Lenin

December 22, 19O3


To the Central Committee from Lenin, member of the
C.C.


I have read the C.C.’s announcement circulated to the
committees,[2]
and can only shrug my shoulders. A more ridiculous misunderstanding I cannot
imagine. Hans has been cruelly punished by this for his credulity and impressionability. Let him explain to me, in the name of all that’s holy, where
he gets the temerity to speak in such an unctuous tone about peace when the
opposition (Martov included) has formally rejected peace in the reply
to the Central Committee’s ultimatum? Is it not childishness, after this
formal rejection of peace, to believe the chatter of Martov who, firstly, does
not remember today what he said yesterday and, secondly, cannot answer for the
whole opposition? Is it not naïve to speak and write about peace when the
opposition is on the war-path again, is clamouring at meetings in Geneva that it
is a force, and is beginning a mean persecution in Iskra No. 53? And
to tell a down right lie to the committees!—for example, that the conflict
with the League is “completely at an end”? To keep silent about the first
Council (with Ru)?


Finally, this silly advice that I should go away from here! I could understand
if it has been given by members of the family or relatives, but for such piffle
to be written by the Central Committee! Yes, it is now that the literary war
begins. No. 53 and my letter, published in leaflet
form,[1]

will demonstrate that
for you.

 

I am so angry at your announcement to the committees that for the moment
 I cannot think how you are to be extricated from a ludicrous
 situation, unless it is by declaring that the contents of Iskra
 No. 53, and especially the article “Our Congress”, have destroyed
 all your faith in the possibility of peace. Personally, I see no other way out.


Reply to the committees (and to Martov himself) that the disgracefully false
article “Our Congress” has provoked a polemic in the press, but
that you (the C.C.) will try to carry out positive work. Plekhanov was against
the article “Our Congress” and against Martov delivering a public
lecture.

On Krzhizhanovsky’s return from abroad and on the basis of his report
concerning the results of the negotiations with the Mensheviks, the
C.C. circulated a letter to the local committees which played down the
acute Party struggle and advocated a conciliatory policy towards the
Mensheviks.

Comrades,


In connection with the resolution adopted on December 22 by the editorial
board of the Central Organ, the representative of the C.C. abroad considers it
necessary to point out to the editors the extreme unseemliness of this
resolution, which can only he put down to excessive
irritation.[3]


If Lenin, acting not as a C.C. member but as a former editor, expounded
something which you thought incorrect, you can thresh this out in the press.


Comrade Hans did not conclude on behalf of the C.C. any agreement about
non-publication of the negotiations and he could not do so without our
knowledge. The editorial board cannot fail to be aware of this. Probably
Comrade Hans made a suggestion about non-publication of the
negotiations in
the event of a formal peace being concluded.


Not evasively, but quite categorically, the C.C. representative abroad twice
informed the editorial board of the C.O. that he permitted Lenin’s letter
to be
published.[1]


If the editorial board had not been moved by a spirit of excessive irritation,
it would easily have seen how extremely out of place were its remarks about the
number of C.C. members living abroad. To this and other unseemly attacks of the
editorial board (like the ludicrous charge of some kind of alleged
“secret” printing), the C.C. represen-

    

tative abroad replies merely by a call to remember Party duty and put a stop to
acts capable of making literary polemics the occasion for a split.

December 30, 1903


We have received your letter of December 10 (old style). We are surprised and
angered by your silence on burning issues and your unpunctuality in
correspondence. It is really impossible for matters to be conducted in this
fashion! Get another secretary if Bear and Doe are unable to write every
week. Just think, so far nothing substantial has been received from Deer! So far
(after 20 days) there has been no reply to our letter of December 10 (new
style).[1]

At all costs this scandalous state of affairs must be put an end to!


Further, we categorically insist on the need to know
where we stand in the struggle against the Martovites,
on the need to reach agreement among ourselves and to
adopt an absolutely definite line.


Why haven’t you sent Boris over here, as Hans here wanted? If Boris were
here, he would not be writing us ridiculous speeches about peace. Why
hasn’t Hans fulfilled his promise to write to the Old Man an exact account
of Boris’s mood? If you can’t send Boris, send Mitrofan or Beast in
order to clear up the matter.


I repeat over and over again: Hans’s main mistake lies in having trusted
to his latest impression. No. 53 ought to have sobered him. The Martovites have
taken possession of the C.O. for the purpose of war, and now war is being waged
all along the line: attacks in Iskra, brawling at public lectures
(recently in Paris Martov read a lecture about the split to an audience of 100
and engaged in a

    

fight against Lebedev), the most shameless agitation against the Central
Committee. It would be unpardonable short sightedness to think that this could
not spread to Russia. Things here have reached a stage when the C.O. has broken
off relations with the C.C. (the C.O. resolution of December 22, sent to you),
and when the C.O. has published a false statement (Iskra No. 55)
alleging an agreement about non-publication of the negotiations).


It is high time you gave serious thought to the political situation as a whole,
took a broader view, got away from the petty, everyday concern with pence and
passports, and, without burying your head in the sand, got clear on where you
are going and for the sake of what you are dilly dallying.


There are two tendencies among us in the C.C., if I am not mistaken (or,
perhaps, three? What are they?). In my opinion they are: 1) to procrastinate,
without convening a congress and turning a deaf ear, as far as possible, to
attacks and grossest insults, and to strengthen the position in Russia; 2) to
raise a storm of resolutions against the C.O., to devote all efforts to
winning over the shaky committees and to prepare a congress in two, or at most
three, months’ time. And so, I ask: what does your strengthening of the
positions consist in? Only in your losing time, while the adversary is mustering
his forces here (and the groups abroad matter a lot!), and in your putting off a
decision until you suffer defeat. Defeat is inevitable and will be fairly
rapid—it would be sheer childishness to ignore that.


What will you leave us after the defeat? Among the Martovites—fresh and
increased forces. Among us—broken ranks. For them—a strengthened
Central Organ. For us—a bunch of persons badly handling the transportation
of a Central Organ that abuses them. That is a sure path to defeat, a shameful
and stupid postponement of inevitable defeat. You are merely closing
your eyes to this, taking advantage of the fact that the war abroad is slow in
reaching you. Your tactics literally amount to saying: after us (after the
present composition of the C.C.), the deluge a deluge for the Majority).


I think that even if defeat is inevitable, we must make our exit
straightforwardly, honestly and openly, and that

    

is possible only at a congress. But defeat is by no means inevitable, for the
Five are not solid, Plekhanov is not with them, but in favour of
peace, and a congress could show up both Plekhanov and them, with
their supposed differences of opinion. The only serious objection to a congress
is that it will necessarily legitimise a split. To this I reply: 1) even that is
better than the present position, for then we can make our exit honestly
instead of prolonging the disgraceful position of being spat upon; 2) the
Martovites have missed the moment for a split, and their withdrawal from the
Third Congress is improbable, for the present struggle and full publicity remove
the possibility of a split; 3) a deal with them, if that were possible, is best
of all done at the congress.


Discuss this matter seriously and send your reply at long last, giving the
opinion of each (absolutely each) member of the Central Committee.


Don’t bother me about leaflets; I am not a machine and in the present
scandalous situation I can’t work.

P.S.[1] January 2, 1904.  I have just received the proofs of
Axelrod’s article in Iskra
No.  55[2] (No. 55 will be out in a couple of days). It is much more
disgusting even than Martov’s article (“Our Congress”) in No. 53. We have
here “ambitious fantasies” “inspired by the legends about Schweitzer’s
dictatorship”; we have here again accusations about “the all-controlling
centre” “disposing at its personal (sic!) discretion” of “Party members
who are converted (!) into cogs and wheels”. “The establishment of a vast
multitude of government departments, divisions, offices and workshops of
all kinds.” The conversion of revolutionaries (really and truly, sic!)
“into head clerks, scribes, sergeants, non-commissioned officers,
privates, warders, foremen” (sic!). The C.C., it says (according to the
Majority’s idea), “must be merely the collective agent of this authority
(the authority of the Iskra editorial board), and be under its
strict tutelage and vigilant control”. Such, it says, is “the
organisational utopia of a theocratic nature” (sic!). “The triumph of
bureaucratic centralism in the Party organisation—that is the
result”... (really and truly, sic!). In connection with this article I
again and again ask all C.C. members: is it really possible to leave this
without a protest or fight? Don’t you feel that by tolerating this silently
you are turning yourselves into nothing more nor less than gossip-mongers
(gossip about Schweitzer and his pawns) and spreaders of slander (about
bureaucrats, i.e., yourselves and the Majority as a whole)?  And do you
consider it possible to conduct “positive work” under such “ideological
leadership”? Or do you know of any other means of honest struggle apart
from a congress?

 

((The Martovites, apparently, have Kiev, Kharkov, Gornozavodsky, Rostov
and the Crimea.  This makes ten votes+the League+the editorial board of the
C.O.+two in the Council=16 votes out of 49. If all efforts are at once
directed towards Nikolayev, Siberia and the Caucasus, it is fully
possible to leave them with one-third.))

January 4, 1904 

Old Man writing. I have just received Deer’s letter with a reply to
mine of
     December 10[1]

and I am answering immediately. You don’t have to ask me for a criticism of
Deer’s views! I will say straight out that I am furious with Deer’s
timidity and naïveté.  

1) To write to the C.O. from the C.C. in Russia is the height of
tactlessness. Everything must go through the C.C.’s representative
abroad, and no other way. I assure you, this is essential if you want to
avoid a terrific row. The C.O. must be told once and for all that there is
the C.C.’s plenipotentiary representative abroad and that’s flat.  

2) It is not true that there was some sort of agreement about the
League minutes. You said plainly that you were leaving the question of
publishing or shortening them to us; (As a matter of fact there was no
“agreement” for you to make on this. Not even for the
entire C.C.). You are hopelessly muddled up on this, and if you
were to write a single incautious word, it will all appear in the press
with an immense hullabaloo.  

3) If in your letter to the C.O. about No. 53 you did not use a single
word of protest against the obscenities about Schweitzer, bureaucratic
formalism, etc., then I am bound to say that we have ceased to understand
each other. In that case I shall say no more and come out as a private
writer against these obscenities. In print, I shall call these gentlemen
hysterical tricksters.  
 

4) While the C.C. is muttering about positive work, Yeryoma and Martyn
are stealing Nikolayev from it. This is a downright disgrace and another
warning to you, the hundredth, if not thousandth. Either we win
over the committees and convene a congress, or ignominiously
retire from the scene under the hail of obscene attacks by the C.O., which
denies me access to Iskra.  

5) To speak of a conference of the committees and of an “ultimatum”
(after they have ridiculed our ultimatum!) is simply
ridiculous. Why, the Martovites will simply burst out laughing in reply to
this “threat”! What do they care about ultimatums when they brazenly hold
back money, attack the C.C. and openly say: “We await the first
break-down.”  

Can Deer have forgotten already that Martov is a pawn in the hands of
cunning persons? And after this to still talk about the attitude of Martov
and George towards Deer and Nil! It is offensive to read this
naïveté. In the first place, both Martov and George don’t care a
hang about all your Deer and Nils. Secondly, George is pushed right into
the background by the Martovites and he says plainly that they don’t listen
to him (which is clearly evident from Iskra). Thirdly, I repeat
for the hundredth time that Martov is a cipher. Why didn’t that good soul
Hans make friends here with Trotsky, Dan and Natalya Ivanovna? What a pity
the dear fellow missed such a chance (the last chance) to make a
“sincere”, “happy peace”.... Would it not be wiser to write letters
directly to these “masters” than to weep on the neck of that rag doll,
Martov? rust try and write, it will sober you up! And until you have
written to them and personally received a spit in the face from them, don’t
bother us (or them) about “peace”. We here can clearly see who is doing
the chattering and who the bossing among the Martovites.


6) I gave my arguments in favour of a congress already last time. For
heaven’s sake, don’t pussyfoot to yourself; postponing the congress would
only be a proof of our impotence. And if you continue harping on peace, it
will not only be Nikolayev that the enemies will take from you.  

It’s either war or peace. If peace—then it means that you are giving
way to the Martovites, who are waging a

    

vigorous and clever war. In that case you will suffer in silence while mud is
being flung at you in the C.O. (=the ideological leadership of the Party!). In
that we have nothing to talk about. I have already said in the
press everything there was to be said, and will go on saying everything
in the full sense of the word.


It is clear to me that the hounding we feared if I were to take Iskra
on my own, has started all the same, only now my mouth is stopped. And it is
childishness to rely on Andreyevsky’s talk about the influence of
Lenin’s name.


If it’s war, I would ask you in that case to explain to me by what means, other
than a congress, a real and honest war can be carried on.


I repeat that a congress now is not pointless, for Plekhanov is no longer with
the Martovites. Publication (which I shall secure at all
costs)[3]
will finally separate him from them. And he is already at loggerheads with
them.


The Martovites will not even mention the Six at the Third Congress. A split
would be better than what we have at present, when they have dirtied
Iskra with tittle-tattle. But they will hardly seek a split at the
Third Congress, and we shall be able to hand over Iskra to a neutral
committee, taking it away from both sides.


7) Against the League, I shall do my utmost to achieve a decisive war.


8) If Nil is still for peace, let him come and talk a couple of
times with Dan. That will be enough, I’m sure!


9) We need money. There is enough for two months, and after that not a
farthing. Don’t forget we are now “keeping” a bunch of scoundrels, who
spit on us in the C.O. That is called “positive work”, Ich 
   gratuliere![2]

As the representative of the C.C., I consider it necessary to point out to the
editors that there are absolutely no grounds for raising the question of
lawfulness, etc., on the basis of heated speeches at lectures or on the
basis of
literary polemics. The Central Committee as such has never had, and does not
have, the slightest doubt of the lawfulness of the editorial board co-opted, as
Iskra No. 53 quite justly stated, in complete accord with Clause 12 of
the Party Rules. The Central Committee would be ready to state that publicly as
well, if necessary. If the editorial board sees these polemics
as attacks upon itself, it has every opportunity of replying. It is hardly
reasonable to resent what the editorial board regards as sharply worded
statements in the polemic, when no mention is made anywhere of boycott or any
other disloyal (from the viewpoint of the C.C.) form of activity. We would
remind the editorial board that the C.C. has repeatedly expressed its
full readiness to publish, and made a direct proposal to publish,
immediately both Dan’s letter and Martov’s “Once Again in the
Minority”, without being at all put out by the very sharp attacks to be
found in these documents. In the view of the C.C., it is essential to give all
Party members the widest possible freedom to criticise the central bodies
and to
attack them; the C.C. sees nothing terrible in such attacks, provided they
are
not accompanied by a boycott, by standing aloof from positive work or by
cutting
off financial resources. The Central Committee states even now that it would
publish criticism against itself, seeing in a free
exchange...[1]

Comrade, 

We would propose getting together for a meeting of the Council on
Monday, January 25, at 4 p.m., in the Landolt restaurant. If you appoint a
different place and time, please let us know not later than Sunday, for one
of us lives far away from Geneva.


As regards secretarial duties, we think it should be possible to
restrict ourselves to the services of Comrade Martov, who was already
appointed secretary of the Council at its first meeting.  

We would emphatically protest against Comrade Blumenfeld as secretary
for, in the first place, he does not observe the rules of secrecy (he
informed Druyan of Lenin’s membership of the Central Committee); secondly,
he is too expansive, so that there is no guarantee of calm and
business-like qualities, and there is even the danger of a row and of
having the door locked. Thirdly, we may have to discuss him personally on
the Council, as purchaser of party literature.  

If you consider a special person necessary as secretary, we propose for
this Comrade Bychkov, who is one of the old members of the Iskra
organisation and a prominent Party activist (a member of the Organising
Committee); moreover he is the most impartial and capable of recording
everything calmly.  

Council members....  

P.S. I shall have to come to Geneva specially for the Council meeting,
and the mail takes rather a long time reaching Mornex. I would ask you
therefore to send me a

    

letter not later than Sunday (during the day), if the meeting is
fixed for Monday, otherwise the notice will not reach me in time.  

Alternatively, I would ask you to postpone the meeting until Wednesday.


My address is: Mornex ....

Comrade, 

We are unfortunately compelled to enter our emphatic protest against
the editorial board’s proposal of Comrade Gurvich as secretary.  

Firstly, there were a number of conflicts with him in the C.C.  

Secondly, he has expressed in writing (we can send you a copy) such, an
attitude to the Council, the highest Party institution, that his
participation in the Council meeting is quite impossible.  

Thirdly—and chiefly—we shall probably have to raise in the Council
the question of Comrade Gurvich personally, as a representative of
the League’s board of management, who, in our opinion, has shown a wrong
attitude to the Central Committee. It is inconvenient to have as secretary
a person whose activities are being questioned.  

We draw attention also to the fact that, appreciating the importance of
the Council as an instrument for unity and agreement (and not for disunity
and discord) we immediately proposed as secretary someone who has
taken no part in the dissensions and against whom there has been
no protest by the other side.  

We are sure that the other side, too, the editorial board of the
Central Organ, could easily propose a candidate who has not taken part in
the dissensions and who could not be the subject of discussion on
the Council.  

Yours sincerely, L.

For the C.C. (to be handed to
 N.N.[1]

)



The meetings (three sittings) of the Party, Council ended
yesterday. These meetings brought into sharp focus the whole political
situation within the Party. Plekhanov sided with the Martovites, outvoting
us on every question of any importance. Our resolution condemning boycott,
etc. (boycott by either side), was not put to the vote; a line was
merely drawn in principle between impermissible and permissible forms of
struggle. On the other hand, a resolution of Plekhanov’s was adopted saying
it was desirable that the C.C. co-opt an appropriate (sic!) number
from the Minority. After this we withdrew our resolution and submitted a
protest against this policy of place-hunting on the part of the
Council. Three Council members (Martov, Axelrod and Plekhanov) replied that
it was “beneath their dignity” to examine this protest. We stated that
the only honest way out was a congress. The Council rejected
it. The three members passed resolutions legitimising (!) the editorial
board’s sending out its representatives separately from the C.C., and
instructing the C.C. to give the editorial board literature in the amount
required for distribution (!). That means giving it them for their own
transportation and delivery, for they now send out one “agent” after
another, who refuse to execute commissions for the Central
Committee. In addition, they also have transport ready (they proposed
sharing the cost of carriage fifty-fifty).  

Iskra (No. 57) has an article by Plekhanov calling our
C.C. eccentric (there being no Minority on it) and inviting it to
co-opt the Minority. How many is unknown; according

    

to private information, not less than three out of a very short list
(of 5–6, apparently), perhaps with a demand also for the resignation of someone
from the Central Committee. 

One must be blind not to see now what is afoot. The Council will bring pressure
to bear on the C.C. in every possible way, demanding complete surrender
to the Martovites. Either—an immediate congress, the immediate collection
of resolutions on a congress from 11–12 committees, and the immediate
concentration of all efforts on agitating for a congress. Or—the
resignation of the whole C.C., for no C.C. member will consent to the
ignominious and ludicrous role of accepting people who foist
themselves on the C.C., people who will not rest content until they have
taken everything into their hands, and who will drag every trifle before the
Council so as to get their own way.


Kurtz and I insistently demand that the C.C. be convened immediately at all
costs to decide the matter, taking into account, of course, our votes as
well. We repeat emphatically and for the hundredth time: either a congress at
once, or resignation. We invite our dissentients to come here, so as to judge
the situation on the spot. Let them try in practice to get along with
the Martovites and not write us hollow phrases about the value of peace!


We have no money. The C.O. is overloading us with expenses, obviously pushing us
towards bankruptcy, and obviously counting on a financial crash in order to take
extraordinary measures which would reduce the C.C. to a cipher.


We need two or three thousand rubles immediately at all costs. Without fail and
immediately, otherwise we shall face complete ruin within a month!


We repeat: think it over carefully, send delegates here and take a
straightforward view of the matter. Our last word is: either a congress or the
resignation of the whole Central Committee. Reply at once as to whether you give
us your votes. If not, let us know what is to be done if Kurtz and I
resign, let us know without fail.

Dear friend,


I have seen Beast and only learnt about your affairs from him. In my
opinion, you must make Deer go away at once and change his skin. It is stupid
and ridiculous of him to await the blow. The only way out is to go underground
and travel about. It only seems to him that such a step is difficult and hard to
take. Deer should try it and he will quickly find that his new position will
become a normal one for him. (I utterly fail to understand or share Konyaga’s
arguments against it.)


Next, about the whole political situation. Things are in a terrible
tangle. Plekhanov has gone over to the Martovites and is overpowering us in the
Council. The Council has expressed a desire that the C.C. should have additional
members (this is published in Iskra No. 58). The Council has given the
editorial board the right to send out agents and receive literature for
distribution.


The Martovites evidently have their own war fund and are only waiting for a
suitable moment for a coup d’état (such a moment as a financial crash—we
are without money—or a break-down in Russia, etc.). I have no doubt about
this and Kurtz and I are demanding that C.C. members who do doubt it should
come here to convince them selves, for it is ridiculous and undignified to have
people pulling different ways.


I believe we should now 1) kick up a row in the committees against the C.O. by
means of the most militant resolutions; 2) carry on a polemic against the
C.O. in leaflets of the committees; 3) adopt resolutions on a congress in

    

the committees and publish them locally; 4) set Schwarz, Vakar and others to
work on leaflets for the Central Committee.


Hans should be warned that he will definitely be used to give false evidence
against me, that is certain. If Hans does not want this to happen, let him
immediately send a written categorical statement:
 1) that there
was no agreement about non-publication of the negotiations;
 2) that in the Council on
November 29, 1903, Hans did not promise to co-opt on to the C.C.;
 3) that Hans understood that the Martovites would take over the C.O. for the purpose of peace
and that they balked his expectations by launching war, beginning with
No. 53. We shall publish this statement only if they provoke us.

Comrades,


Please send us more detailed information as to what kind of conference you are
planning, which organisations will be represented, and when and where it will be
held. Further, be so good as to inform us what would be your attitude to the
participation of Polish Social-Democrats in the conference.


On receipt of all supplementary information from you, we shall submit your
proposal, in accordance with our Party Rules, to the Party Council.


With comradely greetings,

 On behalf of the C.C....

Old Man writing. I have read the letters of Zemlyachka and Konyagin. Where he
got the idea that I have now realised the uselessness of a congress, God only
knows. On the contrary, I insist as before that this is the only honest way out,
that only short-sighted people and cowards can dodge this conclusion. I insist
as before that Boris, Mitrofan and Horse should be sent here without fail, for
people need to see the situation (especially that which arose after the Council
meetings) for themselves, and not waste their time preaching to the winds from
afar, hiding their heads under their wings and taking advantage of the fact that
the C.C. is a long way off and it would take a year and a day to reach it.


There is nothing more absurd than the opinion that working for a congress,
agitating in the committees, and getting them to pass well-thought-out and
forceful (and not sloppy) resolutions precludes “positive”
work or contradicts it. Such an opinion merely betrays an inability to
understand the political situation which has now arisen in the Party.


The Party is virtually torn apart, the Rules have been turned into scraps of
paper and the organisation is spat upon—only complaisant Gothamites can
still fail to see this. To anyone who has grasped this, it should be clear that
the Martovites’ attack must be met with an equal attack (and not with fatuous
vapourings about peace, etc.). And for an attack, all forces must be set in
motion. All technical facilities, transport and receiving arrangements should be
handled exclusively by auxiliary personnel, assistants and agents. It
is supremely unwise to use C.C.

    

members for this. The C.C. members must occupy all the committees,
mobilise the Majority, tour Russia, unite their people, launch an onslaught (in
reply to the Martovites’ attacks), an onslaught on the C.O., an onslaught by
means of resolutions 1) demanding a Congress; 2) challenging the
editors of the C.O. to say whether they will submit to the congress on the
question of the composition of the editorial board; 3) branding the new
Iskra without “philistine delicacy”, as was done recently
by Astrakhan, Tver and the Urals. These resolutions should be published in
Russia, as we have said a hundred times already.


I believe that we really do have in the C.C. bureaucrats and formalists, instead
of revolutionaries. The Martovites spit in their faces and they wipe it off and
lecture me: “it is useless to fight!”... Only bureaucrats can fail to see now
that the C.C. is not a C.C. and its efforts to be one are ludicrous. Either the
C.C. becomes an organisation of war against the C.O., war in deeds and
not in words, of war waged in the committees, or the C.C. is a useless rag,
which deserves to be thrown away.


For heaven’s sake, can’t you see that centralism has been
irretrievably shattered by the Martovites! Forget all idiotic formalities, take
possession of the committees, teach them to fight for the Party against
the circle spirit abroad, write leaflets for them (this will not hinder
agitation for a congress, but assist it!), use auxiliary forces for technical
jobs. Take the lead in the war against the C.O. or renounce altogether ludicrous
pretensions to “leadership”... by wiping off the spittle.


Claire’s behaviour is shameful, but Konyaga’s encouragement of him
is still worse. Nothing makes me so angry now as our “so-called”
C.C. Addio.

The C.C. informs the editorial board of the C.O. that it regards the
instruction that letters intended for the C.C. are to be handed to the
C.O. as an illegitimate and unscrupulous confiscation and a violation of trust.


The C.C. states also that it has already fully taken the measure of Comrade
Blumenfeld, who has now been entrusted with the sorting out of letters, on
account of his unreliability in matters of secrecy and his proneness to make
rows.


The C.C. will therefore bring to the knowledge of all Party members such
confiscation and its inevitably harmful consequences for our work.

Comrades, 

Having received notification of your collective decision of the C.C. majority
against a congress and the desirability of putting an end to
“squabbling”, and having discussed this notification among the three
of us (Kurtz, Beast and Lenin), we unanimously adopted the following decision:


1) Kurtz and Lenin will temporarily resign membership of the Council
(while remaining members of the C.C.) until the true nature of our
   differences with the majority of the Central Committee has been cleared
   up. (We stated in the Council that we see no other honest way out of the
   squabbling except a congress, and we voted for a congress.) We stress that we
   are withdrawing temporarily and conditionally, by no means resigning
   altogether, and greatly desiring a comradely clarification of our differences
   and misunderstandings.


2) In view of (a) the need for C.C. members on the Council to live abroad; (b)
   the need for personal consultation with the C.C. members in Russia; (c) the
   need for a C.C. member abroad after the departure of Kurtz, Beast and Lenin
   (Kurtz and Beast are leaving for Russia, Lenin is taking his official and
   full holiday for not less than two months); (d) the need to arrange that the
   conduct of affairs here that give rise to “squabbling” should be
   in the hands of those C.C. members who disagree with us,
   for we are powerless to combat the squabbling otherwise than as we
   are doing,


—in view of all this, we most earnestly request the C.C. to send here
immediately and without fail at least one of its members from
Russia.

 

We ask you to inform us at once of the receipt of this letter and of your reply.


P.S. To avoid gossip and false rumours, we have informed the Council of our
resignation in the following form (copy in full):


“To the Chairman of the Party Council


“Comrade, in view of the departure of one of us, and the holiday being
taken by the other, we are regretfully compelled to relinquish temporarily the
post of C.C.members on the Council. We have informed the Central Committee of
this.

 “With Social-Democratic greetings,
Kurtz,
 Lenin”

I add my personal request to Stake that he should on no account
resign.[2]
If Valentin is unwilling to consult on everything and to hand all,
absolutely all, information to Stake, then let Valentin resign. Let Stake bear
in mind that the whole course of events is now in our favour; a little more
patience and persistence, and we shall win. Make sure to acquaint everyone with
the
pamphlet,[1]

especially
Brutus. After the pamphlet we must make a further attack on Brutus. Brutus will be ours; for the time being I shall not accept his
withdrawal; you should not accept it either; put his resignation in your pocket
for the time being. There is no question of Zemlyachka’s resignation,
remember that; Nil does not even claim that she has resigned. Inform Zemlyachka
about this and stand firm. I repeat: our side will gain the upper hand within
the Central Committee.

Dear friend,


You will, of course, grasp the gist of the matter from our agreement with
Nil.
[2]For heaven’s sake, don’t be in a hurry to make
decisions and don’t despair. Be sure first to read, my pamphlet=

[1]

and the
Council minutes. Do not let your temporary withdrawal from affairs worry you;
better abstain from some of the voting, but do not with draw altogether. Believe
me, you will still be very, very much needed and all your friends are counting
on your early “resurrection”. Many people in the Party are still in
a state of bewilderment and confusion, at a loss to grasp the new situation and
faint-heartedly losing confidence in themselves and in the right cause. On the
other hand, it is becoming more and more evident to us here that we are gaining
from delays, that the squabbling is dying out of itself and the essential issue,
that of principles, is irrevocably coming into the forefront. And in this
respect the new Iskra is pitiably feeble. Don’t believe the
stupid tales that we are out for a split, arm yourself with a certain amount of
patience and you will soon see that our campaign is a splendid one and that we
shall win by the force of conviction. Be sure you reply to me. It would be best
if you could wangle things so as to come out here for a week or so—not on
business, but just for a holiday, and to meet me somewhere in the mountains. I
assure you that you will still be very much needed, and although Konyaga

    

mistakenly dissuaded you from one plan of yours—a thing
put off is not a thing lost! Gird up your loins, we are still
full of fight.


Yours,
 Lenin

This refers to Lenin’s agreement with Noskov, who had arrived in the
capacity of the C.C.’s representative abroad and its second member on the
Party Council to replace Lengnik, who had returned to Russia; the agreement
covered joint action by Noskov and Lenin abroad on behalf of the C. C. and
was signed on May 13 (26) in the presence of a third member of the C.C.,
M. M. Essen, who was abroad at the time.

In connection with the documents sent you (the agreement with Nil and my
official letter to the C.C.
[1]

),

I should like to have a talk with you, but I do
not know whether we shall succeed in meeting. Your
“friend”[3]
was here recently and he spoke of your possible arrival, but Nil
contradicted this news. It will be a great pity if you do not come; your coming
would be absolutely essential in all respects, as there are misunderstandings
galore and they will increase more and more, hindering all work, unless we
succeed in meeting and having a detailed talk. Write to me without fail whether
you are coming and what you think of my pamphlet. In general, you are unpardonably inactive where letters are concerned.


In my opinion, Boris (and Konyaga, too, apparently) have got stuck in
an obviously obsolete point of view. They are still “living in
November”, when squabbling overrode everything else in our Party struggle,
when it was permissible to hope that everything would “come right of
itself” given a certain personal tractibility, etc. This point of view is
now antiquated and to persist in it means either being a parrot senselessly
repeating one and the same thing, or a political weathercock, or renouncing any
leading role whatsoever and becoming a deaf-and-dumb cabman or factotum. Events
have irrevocably shattered this old point of view. Even the Martovites refuse
to have anything to do with “co-optation”; the theoretical

    

drivel that fills the new Iskra has already de facto pushed
all squabbling far into the background (so that now only the parrots can call
for a cessation of squabbling); by the force of events the issue has
boiled down—for heaven’s sake grasp this—it has
boiled down to whether the Party is satisfied with the new Iskra. If we
don’t want to be pawns, we absolutely must understand the present
situation and work out a plan for a sustained and inexorable struggle on behalf
of the Party principle against the circle spirit, on behalf of revolutionary
principles of organisation against opportunism. It is time to get rid of old
bugbears which make out that every such struggle is a split, it is time to stop
hiding our heads under our wings, evading one’s Party duties by references
to the “positive work”... of cabmen and factotums; it is time to
abandon the opinion, at which even children will soon be laughing, that agitation for a congress is Lenin’s intrigue.


I repeat: the G.G. members are in very serious danger of becoming extremely
backward eccentrics. Anyone who possesses a particle of political honour and
political honesty must stop shifting and shuffling (even Plekhanov has
not succeeded in that, leave alone our good Boris!), and must adopt a definite
position and stand by his convictions.


All the very best. Awaiting your
reply,


Yours,


Lenin

We have just received Absolute’s letter about the meeting and do
not understand it at all. On whose initiative is the meeting being arranged? Who
will attend it? Will Nikitich, Deer and Valentin be there? It is essential to
know everything in the greatest possible detail. For what may happen is this:
Deer, Nikitich and Mitrofan may transfer their votes to Nil or Valentin, which
will give them a majority, and they may carry out a coup d’état; it is easier to
do this abroad, where the Council is at hand to sanction their decisions. In
general a meeting here of the soft
members[4] may turn out to be
very dangerous at the present time. Judging by the way Nil behaves, one could
expect anything from him. He says, for example, in connection with
Plekhanov’s letter: “We must reply that we do not agree with
Lenin’s policy, but we don’t want to give him up.” What he
understands by Lenin’s policy, God alone knows. He refused to discuss
matters with Falcon: “You will learn my opinion from Valentin.” He
talks to the
Minority in a very friendly way, quite different from the way he talks
to the Majority. Falcon wanted to go away today, but just now we are in some
perplexity. The “soft” ones alone may decide, if it is to their
advantage, that transfer of votes is not allowed, in which case Falcon ought not
go away—it will be an extra vote and, besides, support for Lenin is
needed. If, however, there are no grounds for thinking that the meeting will end
in a coup, then there is no need for Falcon to hang about. In the first event,
wire:
“Geld folgt”[1]

(meaning: Falcon to travel

immedi-

    

ately); in the second event, wire: “Brief folgt”
[2]

(meaning:Falcon to remain abroad). The address for the telegram
is...[3]


Reply also by letter without delay and in as much detail as possible. Settle the
time more exactly. What do you mean by: prepare lodgings? Do you too think that
all the “stone-hards” can go away without everything falling into
the hands of the hard-soft “Matryona-ites”? If, for example, Valentin
remains while the others go away, he can break a lot of china. In that case,
perhaps, Falcon’s presence will be needed in Russia. Think all this over
very carefully. At present we do not share your optimism concerning the C.C.,
but we are optimists as regards our victory.


If the meeting is a general one, let Stake once more make desperate efforts to
drag Deer out here and explain to him that the transfer of his (Deer’s) vote to
Konyaga or Boris could mean a coup d’état and Lenin’s withdrawal for a
desperate struggle.

Comrade, 

I received your undated letter while travelling, and without having the Council
minutes at hand. At all events I consider it in principle absolutely
impermissible and unlawful that outside a Council meeting members of the Council
should give their votes or make arrangements on any matters that come within the
competence of the Council. I cannot therefore comply with your request about
voting for candidates. If I am not mistaken, the Council decided that all
Council members should represent our Party at the
congress.[1]
Consequently, the question has been settled. If any Council member is
unable to go, then, in my opinion, he can appoint someone else in his place; I
do not know, of course, whether it is customary for international congresses to
permit such substitution, but I do not know of any obstacle to it in our Party
Rules or in the Party’s usual regulations. Personally I am also unable to
go and would like as a substitute for myself Comrade Lyadov, who has
plenipotentiary powers from the C.C., and Comrade Sergei Petrovich, member of
the Moscow Committee.


With Social-Democratic greetings.


N. Lenin, Council member



P.S. Re the communication to the C.C., I shall write to the Geneva
agents, who are in charge of all matters during my absence.

 

Notes

This refers to the Party Council’s decision of May 31 (June 13), 1904,
concerning representation at the forthcoming Amsterdam Congress of the
Second International.

 Dear Comrade, 

I have received your last letter. I am writing to the old address, although I am
afraid that letters are not reaching you; the previous letter was answered in
considerable detail. The comradely trust which is evident in all your letters
induces me to write to you personally. This letter is not written from the
collegium and is not intended for the Committee.


The state of things in your Committee, which is suffering from a lack of people,
lack of literature and complete lack of information, is similar to the state of
things in Russia as a whole. Everywhere there is a terrible lack of people, even
more so in the Minority committees than in those of the Majority, complete
isolation, a general mood of depression and bitterness, stagnation as regards
positive work. Ever since the Second Congress, the Party is being torn to
pieces, and today things have gone very, very far in this respect; the tactics
of the Minority have terribly weakened the Party. The Minority has done all it
could to discredit the C.C. as well, beginning its persecution already at the
congress, and carrying it on intensively both in the press and orally. In even
greater measure it has discredited the C.O., which it has turned from a Party
organ into an organ for settling personal accounts with the Majority. If you
have been reading Iskra there is no need to say anything to you about
this. In their at tempts to dig up fresh disagreements they have now trotted
forth as their slogan “liquidation of the fourth, Iskra, period”
, and are burning everything that they worshipped

    

yesterday, totally distorting the perspective and interpreting Iskrism in a way
its worst enemies used to interpret it. The Party functionaries, who remember
what they stood for yesterday, do not follow the lead of the C.0. The vast
majority of the committees adhere to the standpoint of the Congress majority and
are breaking their spiritual ties with the Party organ more and more.


The present state of affairs, however, is having such an effect on positive
work, and hindering it to such an extent, that among a whole number of Party
functionaries a mood has developed that makes them immerse themselves in
positive work and stand completely aloof from the embittered internecine
struggle which is taking place in the Party. They want to close their eyes, stop
up their ears and hide their heads under the wing of positive work; they are
running away to escape from things which no one, being in the Party, can now
escape from. Some of the C.C. members have adopted such a
“conciliatory” attitude in an attempt to blanket the growing
disagreements, to blanket the fact that the Party is disintegrating. The
Majority (the non-conciliatory Majority) says: we must quickly find some way
out, we must come to some arrangement, we must try to find the framework within
which the ideological struggle can proceed more or less normally; a new congress
is needed. The Minority is against a congress; they say; the vast majority of
the Party is against us and a congress is not to our advantage; the
“conciliatory” Majority is also against a congress, it is afraid of
everyone’s growing animosity against the C.0. and the C.C. To think that a
congress could lead only to a split would mean to admit that we haven’t
got a Party at all, that Party feeling is so poorly developed among all of us
that it cannot over come the old circle spirit. In this respect we have a better
opinion of our opponents than they have of themselves. Of course, it is
impossible to guarantee anything, but an attempt to settle the conflict in a
Party manner, and to find a way out, must be made. The Majority, at any rate,
does not want a split, but to go on working under the conditions which have now
been created is becoming more and more impossible. Already more than ten
committees have expressed themselves in favour of a congress (St.

    

Petersburg, Tver, Moscow, Tula, Siberia, Caucasus, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev,
Odessa, Riga, Astrakhan), but even if the great majority of the committees
pronounce for a congress it will not take place so very soon, for both the
C.0. and the C.C., and probably the Council as well, will oppose the wishes of
the majority of the comrades in Russia.


With regard to literature, the C.C. comrade with whom we talked about this
replied that it was being punctually supplied to your Committee. Obviously,
there has been some confusion. Persons were sent to you twice, but in Russia
they were directed to other places. We shall try to send you new things as
opportunity arises.


 With comradely greetings,
Lenin

August 24, 1904 
 Comrades, 

Being rather far from Geneva, I learnt only today that the editors of the
Central Organ intend to publish a “declaration” said to have been
adopted by the Central
Committee.[2]


I consider it my duty to warn the editors of the C.O. that already on August 18,
1904, I made a statement contesting the lawfulness of this
declaration,[1]

i.e.,
the lawfulness of the decision on this question allegedly adopted by a majority
of the C.C.


There are at present six members of the C.C. (owing to Comrade Mitrofan’s
resignation and, if the rumour is to be believed, the recent arrest of Zverev
and Vasiliev).


According to my information, it is even probable that only three members out of
the six had the audacity to speak for the whole C.C. and to do so not even
through the two representatives abroad, who are formally bound by the agreement
of May 26, 1904 (this agreement was signed by Glebov, Zverev and myself).


I enclose herewith a copy of my statement of August 18, 1904, and I must state
that the editorial board of the C.O. will be responsible for giving press
publicity to the whole incident and conflict in the event of the
“declaration” being

    

published before the matter of my protest against the
  validity of the decision has been settled within the C.C.

 N. Lenin,
   C.C. member and representative abroad 


P.S. In any case I consider it absolutely obligatory that publication of the
“declaration” should be withheld until I have thrashed out the
matter with Comrade Glebov who, according to my information, is today leaving
Berlin for Geneva. Not even I, a member of the C.C., have any knowledge of the
latter’s decision concerning the publication of this declaration.


If, nevertheless, the editorial board decides to publish the declaration, then I
consider it is morally bound to publish also my protest against its lawfulness.

To Com. Glebov. In reply to your note of August 30, 1904, we inform
you that the lawfulness and validity of the C.C. decisions to which you refer
have been contested by C.C. member, Comrade Lenin. In the capacity of
C.C. agents who have been kept informed of the whole course of the conflict
within the C.C. we, in turn, also contest the lawfulness of this decision and
state that the decision of the C.C. cannot be recognised as lawful, for it
begins by stating as a fact what is known to be untrue: here abroad we ourselves
have seen two C.C. members who were not informed of the meeting of the
Central Committee. Since you have once told us a direct untruth (about an
alleged ban imposed by the Central Committee on Comrade Lenin’s
book
[1]

)

we
are the more inclined to doubt statements emanating from you. We therefore
request you to furnish us immediately with exact data for checking the
lawfulness of the C.C. decision (composition of the meeting
[2]

and written
statements of each participant). While having no intention whatever to oppose
lawful decisions of an actual majority of the C.C. we shall pay no attention to
any statement of yours until this lawfulness has been proved to us.

 

Notes
 

[1]
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back (see present edition,

[2]
To avoid misinterpretation, we state that after publication of the
untrue statement (in the declaration) concerning the composition of the
meeting, we have absolutely no possibility of arriving at the truth except
by getting to know the composition of the meeting.

September 2, 1904 

Comrade,


Please let me know whether you intend to reply to my protest in connection with
the decision allegedly adopted by a majority of the Central Committee.


At what “preceding regular meeting of the C.C.” did Comrade Osipov
announce his resignation?


When exactly and by whom were the C.C. members who were absent when Osipov made
this statement informed about this?


Did Comrade Valentin report to the Central Committee about his (Valentin’s)
dispute with Comrade Vasiliev in connection with the supposed resignation of
Comrade Osipov?


When and to whom did Comrade Travinsky formally announce his resignation? Please
let me have a copy of this announcement and all the details. Perhaps someone has
already written to me about this, but the letter has gone astray?


Until the lawfulness (of the composition of the C.C. and its decision
of. . . July) has been “verified” by all members of the
C.C., I do not regard either Comrade Glebov or myself entitled to represent the
C.C. in the Party Council.


N Lenin,

C.C. member

 September 2, 1904


Comrade,


In reply to your invitation of August 31, 1904, to a sitting of the Council, I
must state that until the lawfulness of the composition of the C.C. and of its
last, allegedly regular, meeting has been verified by all C.C. members, I do not
consider either Comrade Glebov or myself entitled to represent the C.C. in the
Party Council. Until such a check is made I regard all official steps undertaken
by Comrade Glebov (and participation in the Council is also an official
step) as unlawful.


I shall confine myself to pointing out one obvious untruth and one
inaccuracy in the “verification” of the C.C.’s composition
carried out by three C.C. members at their “meeting” of. . . July. 1)
Regarding the resignation of Mitrofanov, I have the written statement of
Comrade Osipov. About the resignation of Travinsky, I have had no definite
written statement from anyone. Three C.C. members at least prematurely accepted
the resignation, without consulting the other members. 2) Regarding the
notorious resignation of Comrade Osipov I have a written communication of
C.C. member Vasiliev about his dispute with Comrade Valentin and the decision to
examine the dispute at a general meeting of the Central Committee. About
Osipov’s resignation, too, I have not had a single communication. The
statement of the three C.C. members that Osipov formally announced his
withdrawal at the preceding regular meeting of the C.C. is an obvious lie,

    

documentarily refuted by the agreement of May 26, 1904,
  signed by Zverev and Glebov. This agreement, which was
  concluded months after the “preceding regular meeting of
  the C.C.” and after Osipov is alleged to have joined the
  St. Petersburg Committee, records the C.C. as consisting
  of nine members, i.e., including Osipov.


 N. Lenin,

C.C. member

Comrade,


In connection with the copies you have sent me, I have to state that the Council
need not have troubled to repeat its invitation, seeing that I have already
replied to it by a refusal. Never have I expressed a desire that investigation
of the “conflict” in the C.C. should be submitted to the Council. On
the contrary, I have plainly stated in letters to Comrade Glebov and to Comrade
Martov that only the C.C. members as a whole are competent to verify the
lawfulness of its composition. The Council is not authorised even by the Rules
to examine conflicts within the Central
Committee.[1]


Since the Bureau of the International Congress has accept ed the transference by
me of my mandate,
[2]I am no longer accountable in any way
to any Council. I shall willingly give explanations (in writing or in print) concerning definite issues to anyone who wants them.


N. Lenin,

C.C. member

Comrades,


In reply to your resolution on the desirability of an Organising Committee of
the Majority being set up, we hasten to inform you that we entirely agree with
your idea. We should prefer only to call the group not an Organising Committee,
but a Bureau of the Majority Committees. We do not consider it possible for us
to appoint the B.M.C. ourselves, and are restricting ourselves to recommending
comrades Martyn, Demon and K., Baron, Sergei Petrovich, Felix and Lebedev, who
(as you know) have actually begun the work of uniting the Majority
committees. We think that, given the direct support of several committees, these
comrades could act as a special group uniting the activities of supporters of
the Majority.


(Participants of the Meeting of
the 22[2])


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Three conferences of local Bolshevik committees—the Southern, Caucasian
and Northern conferences—were held in September–December 1904. (1) The
Southern Regional Conference (three committees: those of Odessa,
Ekaterinoslav and Nikolayev) was held in September 1904. The conference
declared in favour of convening the Third Congress of the Party and
proposed that an Organising Committee for convening the congress be set up,
consisting of R. S. Zemlyachka, M. N. Lyadov and A. Bogdanov. The
conference instructed Lenin to constitute the full Organising Committee.


(2) The Regional Conference of the Caucasian Union Committee (four
committees: those of Baku, Batum, Tiflis and Imeretia and Mingrelia) was
held in November 1904 in Tiflis. The conference declared in favour of
immediately convening the Third Congress of the Party and elected a bureau
to make preparations for the congress.


(3) The Northern Regional Conference (six committees: those of
St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga, Northern and Nizhni-Novgorod) was held
in December 1904. The conference passed a vote of non-confidence in the
Party’s central bodies seized by the Mensheviks, declared strongly in
favour of convening the Third Congress of the Party, and set up a special
bureau for organising the congress.





[2]
This refers to the meeting held in the neigbourhood of Geneva on Lenin’s
initiative during the early part of August 1904. The


   

meeting was attended by 19 members of the R.S.D.L.P., including Lenin,
Krupskaya, Olminsky, Lyadov, and Lepeshinsky.  The initial variant of the
appeal “To the Party”, written by Lenin, was adopted ^^(see Vol. 7 of
this edition)^^. Shortly afterwards three more Bolsheviks added their votes
to the decisions of this meeting, and the appeal “To the Party” was
issued on behalf of 22 Bolsheviks.


The appeal became the Bolsheviks’ programme of struggle for convening the
Third Congress of the Party.

1) To be written to all our committees:


“Immediately and without fail write officially to the C.C. in
Russia (sending us a copy of your letter) requesting that the Committee be
supplied with all publications of the new publishing house of Bonch-Bruyevich
and
Lenin,[1] and that they be supplied regularly. Get a reply from
the C.C. and send it to us. Make use of a personal meeting with C.C. members and
ask them about their reply in the presence of witnesses. Have you received the
supplement to Nos. 73-74—the decisions of the
Council[2]? You
must protest against this scandalous affair, it is a downright falsification of
the congress, a downright incitement of the periphery against the committees and
a shifting of the squabble to the Council. If you have not received these
decisions, enquire about them also from the C.C. and keep us informed. We shall
issue shortly a detailed examination of these Council decisions.”


2) The full reply of the 22 concerning the Organising Committee to be
   sent to Odessa, stipulating that the place they received it from is
   to be kept secret. The letter to be inscribed “for Baron, Osip and
   Leonsha exclusively”. Let Odessa send us, Felix and Mouse
   immediately their reply, their amendments, or their agreement, etc. Let
   Odessa send immediately Nikolayev’s decision concerning the congress.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin publishing house of Social-Democratic
party literature was set up by the Bolsheviks after the Menshevik
editorial board of Iskra refused to publish the statements of
organisations and Party members supporting the decisions of the Second
Congress and demanding the convocation of the Third Congress of the Party.





[2]
The decisions of the Council of the R.S.D.L.P. were published in a separate
supplements to Nos. 73 and 74 of Iskra. The first of these
decisions dealing with the procedure for convening the Third Congress
listed a number of measures aimed at obstructing agitation in favour of the
congress and preventing its being convened in the immediate future.

Geneva, October 30, 1904


Comrades,


I should like through you to answer Comrade Simonov, who was here as a
representative of the Siberian Union and who, before departing, left me a letter
(I was not in Geneva at the time) setting out his conciliatory point of
view. It is this letter, the contents of which are probably known to you from
Comrade Simonov, that I should like to talk to you about. Comrade
Simonov’s point of view amounts to this: they (the Minority) are, of
course, anarchists and disrupters, but there is nothing to be done with them; a
“truce” is necessary (Simonov stresses that, in contrast to other
conciliators, he does not speak of  peace but of a truce) in order to find some
way out of an intolerable situation, and to gather strength for a further
struggle against the Minority.


I found Simonov’s letter extremely instructive as coming from such a
rarity as a sincere supporter of conciliation. There is so much
hypocrisy among the conciliators that one finds it refreshing to meet the views
(even if incorrect) of a man who says what he thinks. And his views are certainly incorrect. He himself realises that it is impossible to be
reconciled with falsehood, confusion and squabbling, but what is the
sense of talking about a truce? For the Minority will use such a truce
merely for strengthening their positions. Factional polemics (cessation of which
was hypocritically promised by the hypocritical C.C. in its recent letter to
the committees, a letter that you too have prob-

    

ably already received) have not ceased but have assumed the especially vile
forms that were condemned even by Kautsky, who sides with the Minority. Even
K. Kautsky said in his letter to Iskra that a “hidden”
polemic is worse than any other, for the issue becomes confused, hints re main
obscure, straightforward answers are impossible. And take Iskra; the
leading article in No. 75, the subject of which is very remote from our
differences, will be found interspersed, without rhyme or reason, with senilely
embittered abuse against the Ivanovs on the Council, the sheer ignoramuses,
etc., etc. From the standpoint of our deserters from the C.C., this, probably,
is not factional polemics! I say nothing, in substance, of the arguments used by
the author of the leading article (apparently Plekhanov): that Marx was
mild towards the Proudhonists. Can you imagine a falser use of
historical facts and great names of history? What would Marx have said if the
slogan of mildness was used to cover up muddling the distinction
between Marxism and Proudhonism? (And is not the new Iskra wholly occupied in muddling the distinction between Rabocheye Dyeloism and
Iskrism?) What would Marx have said if mildness had been made a cover for
asserting in print the correctness of Proudhonism against Marxism? (And is not
Plekhanov now playing the fox in print by pretending to recognise that the
Minority is correct in principle?) By this comparison alone Plekhanov gives
himself away, betrays the fact that the relation of the Majority to the Minority
is equivalent to the relation of Marxism to Proudhonism, to that very relation
of the revolutionary to the opportunist wing which figures also in that
memorable article “What Should Not Be Done”. Take the decisions of
the Party Council (No. 73 and the supplement to Nos. 73-74) and you will see
that the cessation of the Minority’s secret organisation, proclaimed in
the above-mentioned letter of the C.C. to the committees, signifies nothing but
the passing of three C.C. members into the secret organisation of the
Minority. In this sense the secret organisation has really disappeared,
for all three of our so-called central institutions—not only the C.C.
 and
the Council, but also the Central Committee—have now become a secret
organisation (for struggle against the Party). In the name of a struggle
(“on prin-

    

ciple”) against formalism and bureaucracy, they are now declaring war on
the “headings”, declaring that the publishing house of the Majority
is not a Party one. They falsify the congress, counting the votes falsely (16
x4==61, for five members of the Council figure in the total 61, but in half the
organisations the Council figures as an organisation with two votes!),
concealing the resolutions of the committees from the Party (it is concealed
that Nizhni-Novgorod, Saratov, Nikolayev and the Caucasus were in favour of a
congress: see the last resolutions in our pamphlet To the Party and
The Fight for a Congress
[1]). They bring squabbling into the
Council, interminably distorting the question of representation at the Amsterdam
Congress
[2]and having the audacity to publish charges of
“deceit” against the Northern Committee, when this incident had not
only not been investigated (although the C.C. had decided to investigate it as
far back as July), but the comrade accused by some slanderer has so
far not even been questioned (during three months, August, September
and October, this comrade was abroad and saw Central Committee member Glebov,
who had taken the decision for an investigation but did not take the trouble to
present the charges to the accused person himself!). They encourage disruption
in the name of the Council, inciting the “periphery” to attack the
Majority committees, and uttering a deliberate lie about St. Petersburg and
Odessa. They condemn as an “abuse” the voting of one and the same
comrades in different committees, when at the same time three Council
members—Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod—vote three times
against a congress: once on the editorial board, once in the Council
and once in the League! They assume the powers of a congress by declaring
credentials invalid. Isn’t that falsifying the congress? And can it be
that Comrade Simonov would advise a truce in relation to
these tactics as well?


Take the report to the Amsterdam Congress
[3]which has recently been
issued in Russian. Deliberately flouting the will of the Party, the Minority
speak in the name of the Party, repeating in a covert form the same lie about
the old Iskra which was always being propagated by Martynov and Co.,
and which is now being served up by Balalaikin-

    

Trotsky. Or maybe Comrade Simonov wants a truce with this Balalaikin too (whose
pamphlet is published under the editorship of Iskra as plainly stated
in Iskra)? Maybe here, too, he believes in the cessation of factional
polemics promised by the C.C.?


No, the belief that a truce with hypocrisy and disruption is permissible is one
that is unworthy of a Social Democrat and profoundly erroneous at bottom. It is
faint heartedness to think that “there is nothing to be done” with
writers, even notable ones, and that the only tactic left in relation to them is
that formulated by Galyorka (“Down with Bonapartism”) in the words
“You curse but bow down”. To the conversion of all the Party’s
central institutions into a secret organisation for struggle against the Party,
to the Council’s falsification of the congress, the Majority replies by a
further and inevitable strengthening of its unity. Disdaining hypocrisy, it
openly puts for ward a programme of struggle (see the resolution of the 22
endorsed by the Caucasian Union,=

[4]and the Committees of
St. Petersburg, Riga, Moscow, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav and Nikolayev. The C.O., of
course, concealed this resolution from the Party although it received it two
months ago). The southern committees have already taken a decision to unite
the committees of the Majority and to set up an Organising Committee to combat
the flouting of the Party. There is not the slightest doubt that such an organisation of the Majority will be set up in the near future and will act
openly. Despite the lying stories of deserters from the C.C., the adherents of
the Majority are growing in number in Russia, and the young literary forces,
repelled by the muddled and hypocritical Iskra, are beginning to rally
from all sides to the newly-started publishing house of the Majority (the
publishing house abroad of Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin) with the aim of giving it
every possible support by transforming, enlarging and developing it.


Comrade Simonov had no reason to be down-hearted. He was wrong to jump to the
conclusion that, however nasty it was, there was nothing to be done about
it. There is something to be done! The more grossly they flout the idea of a
congress (Balalaikin-Trotsky, writing under the editorship of Iskra,
has already declared a congress to be

    

a reactionary attempt to reinforce the plans of the
Iskrists. Ryazanov was more sincere and honest when he called the congress a
packed affair) and the more grossly they flout the Party and its functionaries
in Russia, the more merciless becomes the rebuff they encounter and the more
closely does the Majority rally its ranks, uniting all per sons of principle and
recoiling from the unnatural and intrinsically rotten political
alliance of Plekhanov, Martynov and Trotsky. It is precisely such an alliance
that we see now in the new Iskra and in Zarya No. 5 (a reprint
of Martynov’s article has appeared). Anyone who sees a little further than
his nose, whose policy is not determined by interests of the minute and
coalitions of the hour, will understand that this alliance, which breeds only
confusion and squabbles, is doomed, and that the adherents of the trend
of the old Iskra, people who are able to distinguish this trend from a
circle even of notable “foreigners”, must and will be the
grave-diggers of this alliance.


I should be very glad, comrades, if you would inform me of the receipt of this
letter and whether you have succeeded in forwarding it to Comrade Simonov.


With comradely greetings,

N. Lenin

This refers to the pamphlet To the Party, in which the appeal
under the same heading written by Lenin was published ^^(see Vol. 7 of this

[2]
The question of representation at the Amsterdam Congress was this:
The Party Council, in its September decision, accused Lenin, Lyadov and
Krasikov of a breach of Party discipline, expressed in their applying
directly to the International Socialist Bureau on the question of Lenin
transferring his mandate to the Congress. The Council further maintained
that Lenin demanded for himself, as a representative of the C.C., the right
to attend the Congress “at a time when he was already in antagonism with
the Central Committee”. Actually, Lenin sent representatives to the
Congress early in August, that is, before his conflict with the conciliator
section of the C.C., which took place towards the end of August.





[3]
This refers to the Report of the Delegation of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party to the Amsterdam International Socialist
Congress (August l4–20, 1904), Geneva, 1904.

The Caucasian S.D. Union united the working-class organisations of
the Caucasus (Tiflis, Baku, Batum, Kutais, Guria, etc.). At the first
Congress of the Caucasian Union held in March 1903 a leading Party organ
was set up—the Caucasian Union Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.



Lenin and the Caucasian Union Committee were in constant and close
contact. In September 1904 the C.U.C. supported the resolution of the
meeting of the “22” and started agitation in favour of the immediate
convocation of the Party’s Third Congress.

Dear Comrade,


I was extremely glad to have your letter. Please write punctually every week,
even if only a few lines, and make sure that all addresses are usable and that
you have reserve addresses for letters and rendezvous. It’s a downright scandal
that the adherents of the Majority are so scattered! No common work is possible
without regular contact and we have had nothing from you for over six months.


I absolutely and fully agree with everything you write concerning the need to
unite the Majority, to rally its committees and prepare for a united congress
capable of en forcing the will of the Party workers in Russia. Very close
contact is essential for all this, otherwise we shall drift apart and you will
know absolutely nothing of our common affairs.


The C.C. has now wholly fused with the Minority and has virtually
become part of its secret organisation, the aim of which is to fight against a
congress at all costs. The new decisions of the Council plainly falsify both the
counting of votes and the will of the committees (supplement to Iskra
Nos. 73-74. Have you seen it?). Now we must be prepared for the fact that they
will not convene a congress on any account, will not shrink from any violation
of the Rules, nor from any further flouting of the Party. They openly jeer at
us, saying “where is your strength?” We should indeed be behaving
like children if we confined ourselves to faith in a congress, without
preparing straight away to counter force by force. For this purpose we must:
1) immediately unite all the Majority committees and set
up a Bureau of the Majority Committees (the initiative has already been taken by
Odessa+Nikolayev-+-Ekaterinoslav) to combat the Bonapartism of the central
bodies;
2) exert every effort to support and extend in every way

    

the Majority’s publishing house (started here by Bonch-Bruyevich and myself; Bonch-Bruyevich is only the publisher). A group
of writers in Russia has already set to work on this and you should immediately
begin collecting and sending all kinds of material, correspondence, leaflets,
comments, and so on and so forth, especially from workers and about the
workers’ movement. Do this without fail and immediately. (If from now on you do not begin
to send us an item every week, we shall break off relations with you.)


In the matter of the Bureau, what has been done already
is this. The Odessa+Nikolayev+Ekaterinoslav committees
took the following decision (quote in full) ...——The 22
answered them as
follows ...——[2]


You must try to go to Tiflis as soon as possible and hand over both the one and
the other. Let them speedily join. It will, of course, be possible to add
members from the Caucasus to the Bureau. And so, let all the committees of the
Caucasus immediately give their opinion about the idea of a Bureau, that is to
say, write to us and to St. Petersburg (or Riga?) (address..., key...), whether
they agree to a Bureau and whether they want changes or additional
candidates. For heaven’s sake see to it that this matter of prime
importance is dealt With properly, sensibly and quickly.


Some comrades, are demanding a conference of the Majority committees in
Russia. We here think this is not only expensive but bureaucratic and
ineffectual. But we must press on with might and main. It is not worth while
coming together to elect a Bureau; it is much better to reach agreement on this
by letter or by a tour made by one or two comrades. When the Bureau speaks out
and is joined by Ekaterinoslav+Odessa+Nikolayev+St. Petersburg+Moscow+Riga+the Caucasus, then this Bureau will at once be speaking as the
representative of the organised Majority.


And so, for heaven’s sake, make haste and answer speedily.

All the very best.
Yours,
N. Lenin

Dear friend,


Please tell Rakhmetov immediately that he is acting like a real pig towards
us. He cannot imagine how eagerly everyone here is expecting from him definite
and precise, encouraging reports, and not the telegrams he sends us. This
eternal suspense and uncertainty is real torture. It is absolutely impossible
that Rakhmetov should have nothing to write about: he has seen and is seeing
many people, he has spoken with Zemlyachka, he has been in touch with Beard, the
Moscow lawyers and writers, etc., etc. He must keep us au courant,
pass on contacts, inform us of new ad dresses, forward local correspondence,
tell us about business meetings and interesting encounters. Rakhmetov has not
sent us a single new contact! It’s monstrous. Not a single item of
correspondence, not a single report about the group of writers in Moscow. If
Rakhmetov were to be arrested tomorrow, we’d find ourselves empty-handed, as if
he had never lived! It’s a crying shame; he could have written everything and
about everything without the slightest danger, and all he has done is to hint
at some young forces and so on. (What is known about Bazarov, Frich, Suvorov and
the others?) Not less than once a week (that’s not much, surely), two or
three hours should be spent on a letter of 10-15 pages, otherwise, I give you my
word, all contact is virtually broken. Rakhmetov and his bound less plans become
a boundless fiction, and our people here are simply running away, drawing the
horrified conclusion that there is no sort of majority and that nothing will
come of the majority. In their new form, the tactics of the Minority have become
quite clear, namely, to ignore and keep silent about the Majority’s
writings and the Majority’s existence, to keep polemics out of the
C.O. and talk importantly about positive work (recently the editors of the
C.O. issued in print, “for Party members only”, a

    

letter to Party organisations concerning a plan for the participation of
Social-Democrats in the Zemstvo campaign—staggering pomposity about
staggering banalities. An analysis and scathing criticism of this letter has
been issued here by=

Lenin[1]

).

It is essential that the Majority should come
forward with an organ of its own
[2]the necessary money and workers’
letters for this are lacking. We must work hard to get both the one and the
other; unless we have the most detailed and exhaustive letters nothing will come
of it. Contacts are not being transmitted, there is no possibility of attacking
one and the same personage from different angles, there is no co-ordination in
the work of the bulk of the Bolsheviks who travel about Russia arranging things
each on his own. This dispersal of efforts is felt everywhere; the committees
are again lagging behind the situation, some of them unaware of the
Council’s new decisions (the supplement to Iskra Nos. 73-74, a
special ten-page leaflet), others not giving serious thought to them and not
realising that these decisions are tantamount to the most complete and brazen
falsification of the congress. Only children could fail to see now that the
Council and C.C. will stop at nothing to sabotage a congress. We must
counterpose this by a force==a press organ+ the organisation of
the Majority in Russia, otherwise we are bound to die. Lenin has not yet seen
Lightmind; it is strange that the latter has moved to the side lines and
maintains a waiting attitude!


And so, give Rakhmetov a triple dressing-down and make him write a diary as a
punishment. Why hasn’t Mme Rakhmetova gone where she promised? We
repeat: all and sun dry will run away (even Galyorka is groaning and moaning),
for there is no sign of any contact with Russia, no sign that Rakhmetov is
alive, working for the common cause, that he is worried and concerned about
it. Without letters there is nothing but complete isolation!

December 3, 1904


Today I sent a business letter to Bonch. I forgot to add an important
thing—that 3,000 copies (of Leiteisen’s dictionary) be
printed; this is essential for price calculation. Tell Bonch about this at once.


I am sending you the statement of the Union Committee and of the Caucasian
representative of the=

C.C.,[3]received today by
Raisa.[1]
In my
opinion, it is absolutely necessary to re-issue this immediately
in leaflet form in our publishing house. Do this at once without fail;
the Nikolayev and other resolutions can be added to the leaflet, but it should
be kept quite small, 2-4 (maximum) pages (without any headings, merely with a
mention below of the publishers).


I have just received your letter. I don’t understand what the matter is
with the “plan” of Lyadov and Rakhmetov, but there is something
wrong here. I shall try to come as quickly as possible and hasten
Destroyer’s arrival.


I warmed the attached sheets but without success. Perhaps you’ll try some other
reagents.



A free evening has occurred unexpectedly. I am sending you on the other side a
letter which I advise you to forward immediately to all three from
me
personally,[2]

without a powwow. It will give them a good shake up; afterwards we
could find out whether the news was exaggerated or not. The fact remains that
disunity is beginning, and a warning

    

must be issued and the culprits denounced most forcefully at the very start. I
strongly advise you to send this letter off at once to all three from
me personally. Tomorrow I shall talk to Destroyer and, I’m sure, he’ll be for
me, so will Vasily Vasilyevich and Schwarz, but it will be best if the text is
mine personally. I wanted to write to Martyn Nikolayevich and give him a piece
of my mind, but I don’t think it’s any good; I shall come and talk it
over, as he is harmless here for the time being. As to the damage that has
started in Russia, my letter will go some way in paralysing it. A pity you did
not make Martyn Nikolayevich write to me at once in Paris about
everything—a great pity, it was so important.


I have re-read the letter to Rakhmetov; a hard word here and there could,
perhaps, have been omitted, but I earnestly advise you to send the
letter off at once from me personally in this sharply worded form.


I called on Leiteisen. He read me Plekhanov’s letter to him. Plekhanov, of
course, swears at Lenin for all he is worth. He writes that
“Trotsky’s pamphlet is trashy, like himself”. He asks
Leiteisen “not to side with the Minority, but with him”
(Plekhanov). He complains of “the tragedy of his life, when, after twenty
years, there isn’t a comrade who believes him”. He says that he asks
for “comradely confidence but not subordination to authority”, and
that he is “seriously thinking of resigning” ... for the time being
this is entre nous.


Deutsch wrote to Leiteisen the other day, asking for financial
assistance—he says they have no money. Zasulich wrote the same thing
(earlier) to Yefron, swearing at Galyorka and considering Sergei Petrovich to
be Galyorka(!).


I hope to leave on Monday, the day after tomorrow, to read on Tuesday and
Wednesday in Zurich, to be in Berne on Thursday, and home on Friday. It may take
a few days longer=

though.[4]


Write to me in Zurich through Argunin (in two envelopes, but see that the inner
one is fairly strong, and be cautious). Have they written from Lausanne, have
they asked me to go there? Have they given an address?


Yours,
N.Lenin

 

Be sure to write immediately to all our commfttees to send us a
formal order to reprint openly for everyone the editorial
board’s letter on the Zemstvo. Do this, just to be on the safe
side. No excuses, please. Get hold of the letter itself (or republish
it) arid circulate it in envelopes to the Majority committees.

December 3, 1904


Dear friend,


I received news of Martyn Nikoayevich’s arrival (I have not seen him myself)
from which I infer that things are in a bad way with us. The Bolsheviks in
Russia and those abroad are at sixes and, sevens again. From three years’
experience I know that such disunity can do enor mous damage to our cause. I see
evidence of this disunity in the fact: 1) that Rakhmetov’s arrival is
being held up; 2) that the weight of emphasis is being shifted from the press
organ here 40 something else, to a congress, a Rus sian O.C., etc.; 3) that
deals of some kind between the G.G. and the writers’ group of the Majority, and
almost idiotic enterprises of the Russian organ, are being connived at or even
supported. If my information about this disunity is correct, I must say that the
bitterest enemy of the Major ity could not have invented anything worse. Holding
up Rakhmetov’s departure is sheer unpardonable stupidity, verging on
treachery, for gossip is increasing terribly and we risk losing impact here
because of the childishly fool ish plans for devising something immediately in
Russia. To delay the Majority’s organ abroad (for which only the money is
lacking) is still more unpardonable. The whole crux now lies in this organ,
without it we shall be heading for certain, inglorious death. We must get some
money at all costs, come what may, if only a couple of thousand, and start
immediately, otherwise we are cutting our own

    

throats. Only hopeless fools can put all hopes on a congress, for it is
clear that the Council will torpedo any congress, wreck it eyen before it is
convened. Understand me prop erly, for heaven’s sake; I am not suggesting
that we aban don all agitation for a congress and renounce this slogan, but only
children could now confine themselves to this, and fail to see that the essence
lies in strength. Let there be a spate of resolutions about the
congress as before (for some reason Martyn Nikolayevich’s tour did not
yield a single repeat resolution, which is a pity, a great pity), but this
is not the crux of the matter—how can anyone fail to see this? An
Organising Committee or a Bureau of the Major ity is necessary, but without a
press organ this will be a pitiful cipher, a sheer farce, a soap bubble which
will burst at the first setback caused by police raids. At all costs an organ
and money, money to us here, get it by any means short of murder. An Organising
Committee or a Bureau of the Majority should auL˜orise us to start an organ (as
quickly as possible) and make a round of the committees, but should the
O.C. take it into its head to first get “pos itive work”
going, and put off the organ for the time being, then such an
idiotic Organising Committee would ruin the whole thing for us. Finally, to
publish anything in Russia, to make any sort of deal with the dirty scum of the
C.C. means committing an outright betrayal. That the C.C. wants to divide and
split up the Bolsheviks in Russia and those abroad is obvious; this has long
been its plan and none but joolish greenhorns could be taken in by


it. To start an organ in Russia with the help of the C.C. is madness, sheer
madness or treachery; this is what fob lows and will inevitably follow from the
objective logic of events, because the organisers of an organ or a popular
newspaper are bound to be fooled by every mangy tyke of a Central Comi˜ ittee. I
plainly prophesy this and I give such people up in advance as a hopeless case.


I repeat: first and foremost comes an organ, and again an organ, and money for
an organ; to spend money on any thing else now is the height of foil . Rakhmetov
must be dragged out here at once, without delay. Making a round of the
committees should have the primary aim of securing local correspondence (it is
inexcusable and disgraceful that

    

we have no correspondent items all this time! It’s a down right shame and a
spoke in our wheel!); all agitation for a congress should be merely an
incidental matter. All the Majority committees should immediately an.d
in actual practice break with the C.C. and transfer all relations to
the O.C. or the Bureau of the Majority; this O.C. mr.&st
immediately issue a printed announcement of its formation, and make it
public at once without fail.


Unless we nip this disunity among the Majority in the bud, unless we come to an
agreement on this both by letter and (most important) by a meeting with
Rakhmetov, we here will all give the whole thing up as a hopeless
job. If you want to work together, you must all pull together and act in
concert, by agreement (and not in defiance of and without agreement). Damn it
all, it’s a downright dis grace and scandal that people go out to get money for
an organ and engage instead in all kinds of piddling lousy affairs.


In a few days I shall come out in print against the C.C. still more
vigorously. If we don’t break with the C.C. and the Council we shall
deserve only to be spat on by everyone.


I await a reply and Rakhmetov’s
arrival.[2]


N. Lenin

Dear friend,


I hasten to reply to your letter, which pleased me very, very much. You are a
thousand times right that we must act vigorously, in a revolutionary way, and
strike the iron while it’s hot. I agree, too, that it is the Majority commit
tees that must be united. The need for a centre in Russia and an organ here is
now clear to all of us. As far as the latter is concerned, we have already done
all we could. Private is working with might and main, he has enlisted
participants, has thrown himself whole-heartedly into the job and is trying his
hardest to find a millionaire, with considerable chance of success. Finally, you
are a thousand times right in that we must act openly. The question at issue
between us touches only on a minor point and should be discussed calmly, viz.:
whether to have a conference of committees or direct formation of a Bureau of
the Majority Committees (we prefer this title to Organising Committee, although
of course it is not a matter of the title) which would be recognised at first by
some, and afterwards by all, of the Majority committees. You are for the former,
we are for the latter. If a conference abroad were possible, I would be wholly
in favour of it. In Russia, however, it would be devilishly dangerous,
bureaucratic and ineffectual. Meanwhile Odessa+Nikolayev+Ekaterinoslav have
already come to terms and authorised the “22” to “appoint an
Organising Committee”. We replied by recommending the title “Bureau
of the Majority Committees” and seven candidates (Mer maid, Felix,
Zemlyachka, Pavlovich, Gusev, Alexeyev, Baron). We are writing to Odessa and
St. Petersburg about

    

this. Alexeyev is already on his way to you. Will it not be best to carry out
the election of candidates through Riga, St. Petersburg+Moscow, and
immediately afterwards make a public statement about this (we are
sending you a draft of the
announcement[1]

),

and then rush off to the Northern
Committee, the Caucasus, Saratov, Nizhni-Novgorod, etc., asking them to
subscribe and supplementing the Bureau as liberally as possible by a couple or
so of their candidates (although it is not very likely that the
subscribing commit tees will demand large additions to the members of the
Bureau). I definitely cannot imagine our meeting with difficulties over the
composition of the Bureau.


The advantages of this method are: speed, cheapness, safety. These advantages
are very important, for speed counts above all now. The Bureau will be the
official body for uniting the committees and will in fact completely re place
the C.C. in the event of a split. The membership of the literary group for our
future central organ is already fully designated (a five- or six-man board:
Private, Galyorka, myself, Schwarz Lunacharsky+perhaps Bazarov). Tackle the transportation job yourself and do so energetically. We
have got hold here of a former Bundist who has done a lot of work on two
frontiers; he promises to arrange things for 200-300 rubles monthly. We are only
waiting for the money before putting him in touch with you.


The disadvantage of your method is the red tape. I consider it quite useless to
present ultimatums to the C.C. and Council. The C.C. is playing the hypocrite
and I don’t doubt now for a moment that they have sold themselves
completely to the Minority and are out to falsify the congress. We should not
harbour any illusions. Now, when they control all the central bodies, they have
a thousand means for falsifying the congress and have already begun to do
so. We shall prove this in print by analysing the Council’s decisions
(Iskra Nos. 73-74, supplement). We, of course, stand and will continue
to stand for a congress, but we must cry from the house-tops that they are
already falsifying the congress and that we shall expose their falsification. As
a matter of fact, I now put the congress in the ninth

    

place, allotting the first to the organ and the Russian centre. It’s absurd to
speak of disloyalty when they have pushed us into it themselves by making a deal
with the Minority. It is a lie to say that the secret organisation of the
Minority has been dissolved; it has not; three members of the C.C. have entered
this secret organisation, that is all. All three central bodies now constitute a
secret organisation against the Party. Only simpletons can fail to see that. We
must reply by an open organisation and expose their conspiracy.


Please strengthen everyone’s faith in our organisation and in the future
organ. We need only to be patient a little longer, while Private finishes his
job. Collect and send us local correspondence (always inscribed: for
Lenin) and material, especially from workers. You and I differ on a
minor point, as I would be only too glad to have a conference. But really, the
game is not worth the candle; it will be much better to come out at once with an
announcement from the Bureau, for we shall easily reach agreement on its
membership and conflicts on this score are improbable. And once the Bureau
proclaims itself it will quickly gain recognition and will begin to speak on
behalf of all the committees. Think this over carefully once more and reply
speedily.

December 10, 1904


I have just returned from my lecture tour and received your letter No. 1. I
spoke with Mermaid. Did you get my abusive letter (sent also to Papasha and
Sysoika)?[1]

 As regards the composition of the O.C., I, of course, accept the
general decision. I don’t think Private should be drawn into this—he
should be sent out here immediately. Further, it is essential to organise a
special group (or to supplement the O.C.) for making regular rounds of the
commit tees and maintaining all contacts between them. Our contacts with the
committees and with Russia in general are extremely inadequate and we must exert
every effort to get more local correspondents’ reports and ordinary letters from
comrades. Why don’t you put us in touch with the Northern Committee? With
the Moscow printing workers (this is very important!)? With Ryakhovsky? With
Tula? With Nizhni-Novgorod? Do this immediately. Further, why don’t the
committees sent us their repeat resolutions concerning the congress?
This is essential. I am very much afraid that you are too optimistic about the
congress and about the C.C.; you will see from the pamphlet The Council
Versus the Party (it is already out) that they go to any lengths, perform
the devil knows what tricks, in their desire to sabotage the congress. In my
opinion, it is a definite mistake on the part of the O.C. not to issue a printed
announcement. In the first place, an announcement is necessary in order to
offset our open way of acting to the Minority’s

    

secret organisation. Otherwise the C.C. is bound to catch you out, to take
advantage of Sysoika’s ultimatums and talk of your “secret”
organisation; this will be a disgrace for the Majority, a disgrace for which you
will be wholly to blame. Secondly, a printed announcement is necessary in order
to inform the mass of Party workers about the new centre. You will never be able
to do this even approximately by any letters. Thirdly, a statement about the
unity of the Majority committees will be of tremendous moral significance as a
means of reassuring and encouraging despondent members of the Majority
(especially here abroad). To neglect this would be a great political mistake. I
therefore insist, again and again, that immediately after the Northern
Conference the Bureau of the Majority (or the O.C. of the Majority committees)
should issue a printed statement mentioning the consent and direct
authorisation of the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, four Caucasian,
Riga, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, and Northern committees, etc. (perhaps the
Tula and Nizhni-Novgorod committees), i.e., 12-14 committees. This will not only
not harm the struggle for a congress but will be of tremendous assistance to
it. Answer at once whether you agree or not. Regarding the Zemstvo campaign, I
strongly recommend that both my
pamphlet[2]

and the letter of the Iskra
editorial board should be published in Russia immediately and openly (without
the stupid heading “for Party members”). I may write another
pamphlet, but the polemic with Iskra must be republished without
fail. Finally, and this is particularly important and urgent: may I sign the
local manifesto about a new
organ[3]

on behalf of the Organising Commit tee of
the Majority committees (or better the Bureau of the Majority Committees)? May I
speak here in the name of the Bureau? May I call the Bureau the
publisher of the new organ and organiser of the editorial group? This is
extremely necessary and urgent. Reply immediately, after seeing Private; tell
him, and repeat it, that he must come here

    

immediately, without delay, if he doesn’t want to run the risk of being
arrested and doing great harm to our cause. People everywhere abroad chatter an
awful lot; I have heard them myself when on a lecture tour in Paris, Zurich,
etc. A last warning: either he clears out and comes here at once or ruins
himself and throws all our work back a year. I do not undertake to present any
ultimatums about a congress to anyone here, as that would only evoke ridicule
and jeers; there is no point in play-acting. Our position will be ten times
cleaner and better if we come forward openly with the Bureau of the Majority and
openly declare for a congress, instead of carrying on silly backdoor
negotiations, which at best will serve only to delay matters and allow new intrigues on the part of people like Glebov, Konyagin, Nikitich and other
rotters. The entire Majority here is fretting and worrying, longing for an
organ, demanding it every where. We cannot publish it without direct
authorisation from the Bureau, but publish it we must. We are doing everything
we can to raise money and hope to succeed; you too must try to raise some. For
heaven’s sake, hurry up with the authorisation to publish in the name of
the Bureau, and print a leaflet about it in Russia.

Dear Comrades,


We have just received the resolutions of your conference.
[1]Send us
without fail a more carefully made copy—there is a lot that is
undecipherable. Without fail, too, carry out as soon as possible your splendid
plan—to send your special delegate here. Otherwise it will really be extremely difficult, almost impossible, to reach agreement and remove mutual
misunderstandings. This is an urgent necessity at the present time.


You still have little knowledge of all the documents and all the dirty tricks of
the Council and the Central Committee. There is not the slightest doubt that
they have already side-tracked the Third Congress and will now split all the
committees. It is essential immediately i) to set up a Bureau of the Majority
Committees, 2) to entrust it with all matters concerning the congress and all
leadership of the committees, 3) to support our organ Vperyod,
[2]
4) to publish your resolutions (do you authorise us to do this?) and
an announcement about the Bureau.

 Please reply quickly.
Yours,

 Lenin


We do not understand what relationship your (Caucasian) Bureau bears to the All-Russia Bureau of the Majority
Committees. Write speedily, and best of all send a delegate.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the resolutions of the Regional Conference of the Caucasian
Union Committee hold in Tiflis in November 1904. On the basis of the
previous resolutions of the Caucasian committees giving support to the
resolution of the “22” and to the idea of convening an emergency congress
of the Party the Conference adopted a resolution calling for the
organisation of broad agitation and struggle for the Third Congress, for
which purpose it elected a special bureau with instructions to contact the
Bolshevik group of “22”. In the postscript to this letter Lenin wishes to
be informed as to what organisational forms of relationship existed between
the Bureau of the Majority Committees and the bureau set up by the
Conference of the Caucasian committees, and asks them to send a delegate.





[2]
Vperyod (Forward)—an illegal Bolshevik newspaper published in
Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5 (18),
1905. Eighteen issues were put out. Lenin was the newspaper’s organiser,
manager and ideological guide. Other members of the editorial board were
V. V. Vorovsky, M. S. Olminsky, and A. V. Lunacharsky. The outstanding role
which the newspaper played in combating Menshevism and highlighting the
tactical issues posed by the revolutionary movement was acknowledged in a
special resolution of the Third Party Congress (1905), which recorded a
vote of thanks to the editorial board.

Dear Comrades,


I have received your letter concerning Borba Proletariata.
[2]
I shall do my best to write and shall tell my editorial comrades about it
too. I am heavily occupied at present with work for the new organ. A detailed
letter on this matter has already been sent to you.
[1]

Let us have your reply as
soon as possible and please send more, more and still more, workers’
letters. The success of the organ depends now on you in particular, for the
beginning is especially difficult.


Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear Beastie,


I have long been intending to write to you, but have been hard pressed for
time. We are now all in high spirits and terribly busy; yesterday the
announcement concerning publication of our newspaper Vperyod came
out. The entire Majority rejoices and is heartened as never before. At last we
have stopped this sordid squabbling and shall get down to real team-work with
those who want to work and not to make rows! A good group of writers has formed,
we have fresh forces. Money is scarce, but we should be getting some soon. The
Central Committee, by betraying us, has lost all credit; it has co-opted (in an
underhand way) the Mensheviks and is raising a hue and cry against the
congress. The Majority committees are uniting, they have already elected a
Bureau and now the organ will cement this unity. Hurrah! Cheer up, we’re all
coming to life again. Sooner or later, one way or another we certainly hope to
see you too. Drop me a line how you are getting on, and, above all, keep
cheerful; remember, you and I are not so old yet—we have everything
before us.


Affectionately yours,


Lenin

December 26, 1904

Dear friend,


I have received your authorisation. In a day or two I shall be
writing for the press on your business.
[1]

I recently received also the minutes of the Northern Conference.
[3] Hurrah! You have done a splendid job and you (together with
Papasha, Mouse and others) are to be congratulated on a huge success. A
conference like that is a very difficult thing under Russian conditions;
apparently, it has been a great success. Its significance is tremendous; it
fits in most appropriately with our announcement of our news paper
(Vperyod). The announcement has already been is sued. The first
number will come out at the beginning of January, new style. The task now
is: 1) To issue in Russia as quickly as possible a printed leaflet about
the Bureau of the Majority Committees. For heaven’s sake, don’t put this
off even for a week. It is devilishly important.


 2) Once again to make a round of the committees of the south (and
 Volga), stressing the importance of giving every support to
 Vperyod.


Transportation will be taken care of, so long as we have Papasha. Let him
take energetic steps for passing on his heritage in case of arrest.


Get Rakhmetov away quickly from dangerous areas and send him to
destination. Be quick!


When we have money, we shall send a lot of people.

 

We are publishing an article in Vperyod No. 1, about the
St. Petersburg disgrace (the Minority’s disruption of the
demonstration).[2]


Hurry up with the public announcement about the Bureau, and be sure to
list all the thirteen
committees.[4]Hurry, hurry and again
hurry! We shall then have the money.

Yours,

Lenin


My best regards to all friends.

Dear Comrade,


I was very glad to learn that it is now possible to establish more regular
contact with you. It would be good if you were to take advantage of this to
write me a few lines about how you feel and what the immediate prospects are. Up
till now all news of you has come through intermediaries, which always makes
mutual understanding rather difficult.


Throughout the year our Party affairs have been in a scandalous state, as you
have probably heard. The Minority has wrecked the Second Congress, created the
new Iskra (Have you seen it? What do you think of it?) and now, when
the vast majority of the committees that have expressed themselves at all have
vigorously rebelled against this new Iskra, the Minority has wrecked
the Third Congress as well. It has become all too obvious to the Minority that
the Party will not tolerate their organ of tittle-tattle and squabbling in the
struggle, of reversion to Rabocheye Dyelo-ism in matters of principle,
to the famous organisation-as-process theory.


The situation now has been made clear. The Majority committees have united (four
Caucasian and the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Riga, Tver, Northern and Nizhni-Novgorod committees). I have begun here (with
new literary forces) to publish the news paper Vperyod (an announcement
has been issued, No. 1 will appear at the beginning of January, new style). Let
us know what you think of it and whether we can count on your support, which
would be extremely important for us.

The Moscow Zubatovist Workers’ Society has a branch in St. Petersburg with the
same Rules (workers of machine industry) and partly even with the same
membership, that is, with those who previously worked in the St. Petersburg
Zubatovist Society (Ushakov, Starozhilov and Gorshkov, Pikunov and Mokhnatkin,
Nikiforov, and others). This Society is sponsored by Litvinov-Fallinsky, Chizhov
and Langovoi. It is strongly recommended that extreme caution be
exercised in contacts with this Society owing to the huge risk of
agent provocateurs. The Society has now gone a bit left, but is
completely at the service of the bourgeoisie and the police.

January 6, 1905


Dear friend,


Thank you for your detailed letter. It will be very welcome if you tackle local
affairs more energetically.


As for my view of the arguments of the editorial board in its second
âsecretâ
leaflet[4] quoted by you, I can only say the
following so far. First of all one is struck by the glaring absurdity of
âsecretâ when 1) there is nothing secret about it, and 2) the same
ideas were repeated in No. 79 (the Ekaterinodar demonstration, the article of a
correspondent, and the editors’ comment). No. 79 is analysed in Vperyod
No. 1.
[1]

 You will receive it before Monday and will see how we present the
issue. Secrecy technique by means of a leaflet nowadays is simply absurd, and I
would attack it particularly sharply.


In essence, the âideasâ of the editors in this new production of
theirs offer, as it were, two points of vantage: 1) Old Believer’s
position, to which the editors refer and which is clarified in Iskra,
and 2) playing at parliamentarism, âparades and
manoeuvresâ, lack of faith in the proletariat, a bashful attempt to
retract on the question of panic (as much as to say, those words about
panic were perhaps âsuperfluousâ (!)).


This should be strongly emphasised


Ad 1. Old Believer’s position, which clearly emerged also in No. 77 (the leading article)—N.B., N.B., in my

    

opinion, is sheer muddle. I shall analyse it in the
press.[5]To
justify his muddled resolution lie is obliged to âinventâ a
good bourgeoisie. A âbourgeois democracyâ is invented
distinct from the Zemstvo people and liberals (as if the Zemstvo people were not
bourgeois democrats!), which, practically speaking, includes the
intelligentsia (by attentively reading No. 77 and No. 79 you will
clearly see that bourgeois democracy is identified with the âradical intelligentsiaâ, âdemocratic intelligentsiaâ and
âintellectualist democracyâ—e.g., No. 78, p. 3, column 3, 9th line
up, and passim).


To class the intelligentsia, in contrast to the Zemstvo people, etc., as
bourgeois democrats is sheer nonsense. To call on them to become an
âindependent forceâ (No. 77, Iskra’s italics) is
claptrap. The real basis of broad democracy (the peasants, handicraftsmen, etc.)
is ignored here, as are also the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are the
natural and inevitable left elements of the radical intelligentsia. I
can only outline these propositions here, as it is necessary to deal with them
in greater detail in the press.


Old Believer is chockful of pretentious drivel about the âdemocratic
intelligentsiaâ being the âmotor nerveâ (!) of
liberalism, and so on. His attempt to represent as a ânew wordâ the
term âthird elementâ, used to describe the uplift intelligentsia,
the intellectuals among the Zemstvo employees, etc., is amusing. See my review
of home affairs in Zarya No. 2–3, where there is a whole
chapter entitled âThe Third Elementâ.
[2]

Only the new Iskra could find a ânew word here.


It is not true that the Social-Democrats, as a vanguard, can influence only the
democratic intelligentsia. They can influence and are influencing the
Zemstvo people too. Our influence on them and on Mr. Struve is a fact overlooked
only by people enamoured of the âevident, tangible resultsâ of gala
performances.


It is untrue that, apart from the Zemstvo people and democratic intelligentsia,
there is no one to influence (peas ants, handicraftsmen, etc.).

 

It is untrue that it is the intelligentsia, in contrast to the liberals, that
constitutes âbourgeois democracyâ.


It is untrue that the French Radicals and Italian Republicans have not obscured
the class-consciousness of the proletariat.


it is untrue that the âagreementâ (of which the editors wrote in the
first leaflet) could have referred to Old Believer’s âconditionsâ. That is absurd. The editors are hedging, clearly
aware that in fact the conditions have gone by the board.


Ad 2. In my opinion, the second point stands out particularly clearly in a
sentence of the second leaflet:


âWe should, in our view, follow our class enemy and temporary political
ally in that very sphere in which they are fulfilling the role of political
leader entrusted them by history, that of emancipating the nation; in this
sphere the proletariat should measure its strength against the bourgeoisieâ.
[3]


This is playing at parliamentarism with a vengeance! âMeasure its
strengthâ—to what depths our despicable intellectualist gasbags degrade
this great concept by reducing it to the demonstration of a handful of workers
at a Zemstvo meeting! What a hysterical fuss, trying to snatch an advantage from
a momentary situation (just now the Zemstvo people are âin the limelightâ
—fire away about the sphere in which they fulfil the role entrusted
them by history! For pity’s sake, gentlemen! Don’t talk so
pretty!). âFull contact of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie
that is politically in the limelightâ What can be âfullerâ
than that! âArgufyingâ with the Mayor of Ekaterinodar him self!


The defence of the idea about the âhighest type of mobilisationâ is
not quite clear, for here you are paraphrasing and not quoting. But this idea
contains the key to their confusion. The distinction between an
âordinaryâ and a âpolitical demonstrationâ (does the
second leaflet really say that in so many words? Is it a printed leaflet? Can
you get a copy? a specimen?) is a real gem. This, I think, is where the
opponent should be brought to bay, for it is

    

here that he comes to grief. It is not demonstrations in the Zemstvos
that are bad, but high-faulting judgements about the highest type that are
fatuous.


I shall leave it at that for the time being. I am preparing for my lecture
today.
[6] It is said that the Mensheviks have decided not to
come.


No. 1. of Vperyod comes out
today.[7]


Write in some detail about your impression of Vperyod, obtain letters for it, especially for the workers’ section.


 [I advise you to compare the second leaflet of the editorial board with No. 77 and No. 78. Old Believer, and No. 79.]


Yours,

N. Lenin

I have received your huffy letter and hasten to reply. You have taken offence
for nothing. If I did say hard things, I meant them lovingly, really, and with
the reservation:
provided Lyadov’s information was correct. The tremendous work you have
done to win over fifteen committees and organise three
conferences[2]
is highly appreciated by us, as you could have seen from the preceding
letter concerning the Northern Conference.
[1]

 We have not taken
and are not taking a single step without you. The young lady who went to
St. Petersburg promised to use her personal connections to obtain money, and we
wrote to N. I.
[3] for you, and not at all through any desire to
ignore you (the inscription âprivateâ was intended solely as a
safeguard against our enemies). The misunderstanding about our letters to
N. I. we shall explain to her immediately. To the devil with N. I., of course.


Many thanks to the committees for sending addresses. Please send some
more. Gusev has gone, Lyadov will be going when we have money.


Lyadov set out the matter of the organ in Russia some what incorrectly, and I
beg your pardon if I lost my temper a bit and offended you.


As regards the open action of the Bureau I shall not argue this point any
more. A fortnight, of course, is a trifle. Believe me, I fully and positively
intend to reckon with the opinion in Russia on all points, and I only ask you
seriously: for heaven’s sake, inform me more frequently about this

    

opinion. If I am guilty of succumbing to the mood of the Bolsheviks abroad, I
can hardly be blamed, since Russia writes rarely and exasperatingly little. I
fully accept the choice of the Northern
Conference,[4]and, believe
me, I do so right willingly. Try to raise money and write telling me that you
are not angry.


Wholly yours,


Lenin

January 29, 1905


Dear friend,


I have a great favour to ask you: please give Rakhmetov a scolding, yes, a good
sound scolding. Really, he acts towards us like the Osvobozhdeniye
people[2] or priest
Gapon[3] towards the

Social-Democrats. I have just been looking at the table of our correspondence
with
Russia.[4] Gusev sent us six letters in ten days, but Rakhmetov
two in thirty days. What do you think of that? Not a sign of him. Not a line for
Vperyod. Not a word about the work, plans and connections. It’s simply
impossible, incredible, a disgrace. No. 4 of Vperyod will come out in a
day or two, and immediately after it (a few days later) No. 5, but without any
support from Rakhmetov. Today letters arrived from St. Petersburg dated January
10, very brief ones. And no one arranged for good and full letters about the
Ninth of
January![5]


I have had no reply whatever to my letter to Rakhmetov
about literary
contributions![1]


Neither is there anything about the Bureau and the
congress.[6]Yet
it is so important to hurry up with the announcement concerning the Bureau and
with the convening of the congress. For heaven’s sake, don’t trust
the Mensheviks and the C.C., and go ahead everywhere and in the most vigorous
manner with the split, a split and again a split. We here, carried away by
enthusiasm for the revolution, were on the point of joining with the Mensheviks

    

at a public meeting, but they cheated us again, and shame fully at that. We
earnestly warn anyone who does not want to be made a fool of: a split, and an
absolute split.

[3]
Gapon, Georgi Apollonovich (1870–1906)—a priest, agent
provocateur in the service of the tsarist secret political police.  On
the eve of the revolution of 1905–07, acting on the instructions of the
Department of the Police, he organised the Association of Russian Factory
Workers of St. Petersburg, which was subsidized


   

by the Department of the Police and the St. Petersburg secret political
police. Provoked the procession of St. Petersburg workers to present a
petition to the tsar on the Ninth of January, 1905 ^^(see Note
281)^^. Escaped abroad, where he had close ties with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. He returned to Russia and resumed contact with
the secret political police. Exposed as an agent provocateur,
Gapon was killed in accordance with a sentence passed on him by the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party.





[4]
The tables of correspondence with Russia were compiled by N. K. Krupskaya,
who kept a record of all the correspondence.





[5]
The Ninth of January 1905—âBloody Sundayâ, the day on which,
by order of the tsar, a peaceful procession of St. Petersburg workers was
shot down. The workers, led by the priest Gapon, were marching to the
Winter Palace to present a petition to the tsar. This cold-blooded massacre
of unarmed workers started a wave of mass political strikes and
demonstrations all over Russia under the slogan of âDown with the
autocracy!â The events of January 9th precipitated the revolution of
1905–07.





[6]
The reference is to the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., preparations for
which were in hand.

Geneva, February 8, 1905


Comrade,


On the very day you wrote to me
[2]we were preparing
a letter to Comrade Hermann
Greulich,[1]

in which we explained
how and why the split in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has
now become an accomplished
fact. We shall send a copy of this letter to the Executive
Committee of the German Social-Democratic Party.


The Third Congress of our Party will be convened by the Russian Bureau of the
Majority Committees. The Vperyod editorial board and the Bureau are
only provisional central bodies. At the present time, neither I nor any of the
editors, contributors or supporters of Vperyod known to me can assume
the responsibility of taking any new, important steps binding on the whole Party
without a Party Congress decision.
[3]Thus, your proposal can be
submitted only to this Party Congress.


Please excuse my poor German.


With Social-Democratic greetings,


N. Lenin


 
Notes

âA Brief Outline of the Split in the
R.S.D.L.P.â(see present edition, Vol. 8).—Ed.

 



[2]
In his letter of February 3, 1905, August Bebel notified Lenin that in
order to liquidate the split in the R.S.D.L.P. the Executive Committee of
the German Social-Democratic Party had instructed him to preside at a court
of arbitration in which representatives of the Bolsheviks
(Vperyod) and the Mensheviks (Iskra) were to be
included. Bebel asked the Bolsheviks to confirm their readiness, in the
event of their agreeing to a court of arbitration and election of their
representatives to such a court, to accept the courtâs award. It was
stipulated that the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks were to cease all
polemics from the moment they submitted to the court.





[3]
Bebelâs proposal was reported in Vperyod No. 8, for February 28
(15), 1905, in a note to the editorsâ comment following the text of the
announcement of the Bureau of the Majority Committees concerning the
convocation of the Third Congress of the Party.

Dear friend,


Many thanks for the letters. Be sure to keep this up, but bear in mind this: 1)
never restrict yourself to making a precis of letters or reports handed over to
you but be sure to send them on (apart from your own letters) in full;
2) be sure to put us in direct touch with new forces, with the youth,
with newly-formed circles. Donât forget that the strength of a
revolutionary organisation lies in the number of its connections. We should
measure the efficiency and results of our friendsâ work by the number of
new Russian connections passed on to us. So far not one of
the St. Petersburgers (shame on them) has given us a single new Russian
connection (neither Serafima, nor Sysoika, nor Zemlyachka, nor Nik. Iv.). Itâs a
scandal, our undoing, our ruin! Take a lesson from the Mensheviks, for
Christâs sake. Issue No. 85 of Iskra is chockful of
correspondence. You have been reading Vperyod to the youth,
havenât you? Then why donât you put us in touch with one of them?
Remember, in the event of your being arrested we shall be in low water unless
you have obtained for us a dozen or so new, young, loyal friends of
Vperyod, who are able to work, able to keep in contact, and able to
carry on correspondence even without you. Remember that! A professional
revolutionary must build up dozens of new connections in each locality, put all
the work into their hands while he is with them, teach them and bring them up to
the mark not by lecturing them but by work. Then he should go to another place
and after a month or two return to check up

    

on the young people who have replaced him. I assure you that there is a
sort of idiotic, philistine, Oblomov-like fear of the youth among us. I
implore you:fight this fear with all your might.


Yours,

Lenin

February 25, 1905


We have just this moment learnt from Lyadovâs letter that the C.C. has agreed
to a congress.
[2]I adjure the Bureau by all that is holy not to
believe the C.C. and not on any account to relinquish a single jot of their
complete independence in convening the congress. The Bureau has no right to
yield an inch to the C.C. If it does we here will raise a revolt and all the
rock-firm committees will be with us. The C.C. has been invited to the congress,
and let it come with the Mensheviks, but we and we alone are convening the
congress. Vperyod No. 8, with the Bureauâs announcement and our
energetic addendum,
[1]

will come out on Tuesday (February 28, 1905). For
heavenâs sake, do everything to ensure that this letter is forwarded
quickly to Lyadov, Sysoika and Zemlyachka.


Yours,

Lenin

[2]
A paragraph from Moscow reporting that a representative of the Central
Committee had made a statement at a meeting to the effect that all the
members of the C. C. agreed to the convening of the Third Congress was
published in Vperyod No. 8, for February 28 (15), 1905. It was
accompanied by an afterward âFrom the Editorsâ written by
M. S. Olminsky. The afterward stated that the C.C. for some months had
resisted a congress and dismissed the committees that had declared for it,
and that now that its tactics had failed it was declaring its agreement to
have a congress convened immediately, obviously with the intention of
wrecking it. Lenin added to Olminskyâs text the following words: âWe hope
that neither the Bureau nor the local committees will let themselves be
deceived by the subterfuges of the Partyâs ‘Shidlovsky Commissionâ.â

Dear friend,


Thanks tremendously for the letters. You are simply rescuing us from the effects
of our foreign environment. Be sure to keep it up. For heaven’s sake,
obtain correspondence from the workers themselves. Why don’t they write?
It’s a downright disgrace! Your detailed account of the Committee’s
agitation at the elections to the Shidlovsky Commission
[2]is magnificent. We shall print it.


One more question: did you accept on the Committee the six workers mentioned?
Reply without fail. We advise you by all means to accept workers on the
Committee, to the extent of one-half at least. Unless you do this you will not
be fortified against the Mensheviks, who will send strong reinforcements from
here.


No one from the Bureau writes about the congress. This worries us, for
Mermaid’s optimism (and partly yours) that the C.C.’s consent to the
congress is a gain, inspires grave misgivings. To us it is as clear as daylight
that the C.C. wanted to fool you. You should be a pessimist as far as the
C.C. is concerned. Don’t believe it, for Christ’s sake! Make the
most of the moment to induce the Minority committees, especially those of the
“Marsh”, to turn up. It’s tremendously important to give special
attention to Kiev, Rostov and Kharkov; we know that there are
Vperyod sup porters, workers and intellectuals, in all these
three centres. At all costs delegates from these committees should be
brought to the congress with a consultative
voice.[1]

The

    

same applies to the Moscow print-workers. Altogether it is most deplorable that
the Bureau did not publish our decision to have the workers’ organisations
invited to the congress: this Is a tremendous mistake. Rectify it
quickly and without fail.


I strongly advise carrying out agitation among all the 300 organised
workers in St. Petersburg for sending one or two delegates to the congress with
a consultative voice at their own expense. The idea will no
doubt appeal to the workers, and they will set to work with a will. Don’t
forget that the Mensheviks will try their damnedest to discredit the congress in
the eyes of the workers by saying: there were no workers present. This has to be
taken into consideration and special attention must be paid to workers’
representation. The workers of St. Petersburg will certainly collect three
hundred rubles for two workers’ delegates (or some Maecenas will make a special
donation for it)—agitation among the workers for sending the cap round
will have a tremendous effect, everyone will know of it. This would be of
enormous importance. Be sure to read this in the Committee and at meetings of
organisers and agitators. Do all our organisers and agitators speak to the
workers about direct connections with Vperyod?

All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin


P.S. Both bureau leaflets (No. 1. on an uprising and No. 2 on the attitude
towards the liberals) are excellent and we are reprinting them in full in
Vperyod.[3]
If only they were to keep this up! By the way:
why has the writers’ group declared that it belongs to the organisation of the
St. Petersburg Committee? The reason this is not advisable is this. A writers’
group attached to the Committee would have no mandate to the congress. If it
was a special group, not belonging to any committee, but an
all-Russia “writers’ group belonging to the Russian S.D.L.P.”, it
would have the right (with the Bureau’s permission) to send a
delegate with a consultative voice. Arrange this, please! We shall not
publish the fact that it is a group attached to the St. Petersburg
Committee. Let

    

1) the S.P.C. part with it; 2) let it become a separate and special
group at least for a time; 3) let it “submit a request”
(there’s bureaucracy for you!) for its delegate to he admitted to the
congress with a consultative voice; 4) let the Bureau give permission. I
can’t believe that a dozen writers will be unable to raise 200 rubles for
a delegate! I’m sure it would be useful to have their delegate at the congress
(for example, Rumyantsev or someone else). Inform the Bureau of this or, better
still, do all this yourself without any reports at all.

The Shidlovsky Commission—special government commission set up
by royal Ukase of January 29 (February 11), 1905, “to enquire into the
causes of the discontent among the workers of the city of St. Petersburg
and its environs” in connection with the mounting strike movement
following the events of Bloody Sunday (January 9). The Commission, headed
by Senator Shidlovsky, was made up of government officials, managers of
state factories and manufacturers. The Commission was to include
representatives of the workers elected by two-stage elections. The
Bolsheviks launched a campaign in connection with these elections, exposing
the true designs of tsarism, which had organised this Commission in order
to draw the workers away from the revolutionary struggle. When the electors
presented their demands to the government, namely, freedom of speech, of
the press, and of assembly, etc., Shidlovsky stated on February 18 (March
8), 1905 that these demands could not be granted. After this the majority
of the electors withdrew from the elections and appealed to the workers of
St. Petersburg, who supported them by going on strike. The Commission was
dismissed on February 20 (March 5), 1905, without having started work.





[3]
The leaflets of the Bureau of the Majority Committees: the first, “Vital
Issues” (concerning the uprising), was published in the newspaper
Vperyod No. 9, for March 8 (February 23), 1905; the second, “The
Attitude of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party to the Liberals”,
in Issue No. 10 for March 15 (2), 1905.

March 11, 1905


Dear friend,


I have just received Nos. 10 and 11.
[1]

Many thanks, particularly for the
scolding in No. 10. I love to hear people scold—it means they know what
they are doing and have a line to follow. You’ve given the “old
wolf” a proper trimming; the mere perusal of it made him scratch himself.
No. 11, though, showed that you are far too optimistic if you hope so
easily to come to terms with the St. Petersburg Mensheviks. Oh, I fear
the Danaans[2]
and advise you to do the same! Have you noticed that
everything that is not to their advantage remains a matter of words, undocumented—for example, the C.C.’s agreeing to a congress. Issue No. 89 of
Iskra appeared today with the Council’s decision of March 8,
1905, against a congress—a lying, raging decision (“by acting the way
they do, the participants in a congress place themselves outside the
Party”), which gives the number of “qualified Party organisations,
apart from the central bodies”, as of January 1, 1905, as thirty-three (a
shameless lie, non-existent committees, like that of the Kuban and the
unendorsed Kazan Committee, have been invented, while in the case of two others,
those of Polesye and the North-West, the date has been mixed up, January 1,1905,
being stated instead of April 1, 1905). Clearly there can be no question of the
Council’s participation in the congress, nor, consequently, of the League
and the Central Organ. I’m very glad of this, and I don’t believe
that the

    

Mensheviks in Russia will go; I don’t believe it. So far not one of you
has sent us a single written statement of a single Menshevik committee agreeing
to a congress. Be under no illusion! If the St. Petersburg Mensheviks agree to
make concessions, demand from them, as a conditio sine qua non, recognition
of the congress to be convened by the Bureau, and recognition of the
St. Petersburg Committee as the only legal committee connected with the
working-class movement—to be given in writing, and copies to be sent to Vperyod without
fail (over their own signatures) and on behalf of all the members, specified by
name, of the St. Petersburg Minority group. Even then do not allow them any
contacts at all—otherwise you will win yourselves internal enemies,
mark my words!


Inform Rakhmetov immediately by express telegram that around March 20,
1905, there will be a most important conference here with the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party and a host of other parties about an
agreement for an
uprising[3]
—Rakhmetov’s presence is essential, let him come post haste and
lose no time.


In conclusion I tell you once again: you do not know the Minority forces
throughout Russia and are under an illusion. This is a mistake. The Mensheviks
at present are stronger than we are; it’s going to be a long and hard
fight. The icons
abroad[4]
raise a heap of money. I consider it
simply indecent for us to raise the question of an agreement with the
Bund, etc., after their (and the Lettish) conference with
the C.C.[5]
(minutes in
Posledniye Izvestia[6] and in
Iskra No. 89). It would be idiocy; it would look as if we were
thrusting ourselves upon them. We shall be told: we don’t know you, we
have already reached agreement with the C.C. It will end in disgrace, believe
me!


All the very best. Lenin

March 16, 1905


Dear friend,


I have just learnt that, at the request of the Bund, the conference here of
eighteen Social-Democratic and other revolutionary parties
(including the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the P.P.S.) has been postponed
to the beginning of April. It is extremely important for us to settle jointly
with Rakhmetov a number of fundamental questions concerning our participation
in this conference (its aim is to reach agreement on an
uprising). Iskra is carrying on a most vile intrigue. If Rakhmetov has
not left yet, make every effort to see that he goes immediately, and let me know
at once without fail exactly what you know about the time of his departure.


We are pretty worried here about the congress. It’s all very well for you, Igor
and Lyadov to write about the Old Man being nervy. Who wouldn’t be nervy
when we are surrounded here by enemies who take advantage of every item of news
and who get their news more quickly than we do. Really, this is unpardonable on
the part of the Bureau. As regards the East, for example, all we know is that
Zemlyachka is touring the Urals and that Lyadov visited Saratov. The reply
from the latter place is vague, nothing definite. We do not know what
arrangements have been made for publishing leaflets over the signature of the
“Committees of the Eastern District”. It is a disgrace and a scandal! Recently the Socialist-Revolutionaries showed us one such leaflet, a stupid
one, against Gapon! Obviously, this is a C.C. intrigue, but surely two members
of the Bureau who

    

visited the East; could have learnt something and written us about it in good
time, so as not to put us in an idiotic position in face of the enemy!
Don’t they feel ashamed at putting Vperyod in such an extremely
awkward position? And more than awkward, because Iskra brazenly takes
advantage of everything. In Iskra No. 89 the Council excommunicates
everyone who goes to the congress. The votes are again falsified there. They
count 75 votes as of January 1, 1905 (33x2=66+9 from the C.C., Central
Organ and Council). They have invented the Kazan and Kuban committees, which
were never endorsed, and lie about the Polesye and North-Western committees
having been endorsed as of January 1, 1905. Actually, they were not endorsed
until April 1, 1905. We exposed this lie in Vperyod
No. 10.[1]


Here is something that should be borne in mind: for the congress to be lawful
from Iskra’s point of view, there must be nineteen
committees attending it. By our reckoning, this is wrong. But if there were 28
(apart from the League) fully qualified organisations in Russia as of
January 1, 1905, then the participation of 14–15 at the congress is
extremely desirable, almost essential. Meanwhile, we have 13—1
(Ekaterinoslav)+2 (Voronezh and Tula)==14, and that only by counting Tiflis, a
doubtful. Of course, the congress is necessary all the same, if only of a dozen
committees, and the sooner the better. Any kind of congress, so long us it is a
congress. But why is there no news of the Bureau having visited a
single neutral or Menshevik committee? Was it not decided that the
Bureau would invite and visit all of them? Why hasn’t Lyadov visited the
Kuban Committee? Why, in travelling through, did he not invite to the congress
the Don, Kharkov, Gornozavodsky and Kiev committees? And the various groups in
these towns? An excellent means of stirring the workers is to invite them to the
congress themselves. Why isn’t this being done? It would really
have enormous significance! Why isn’t there a scrap of news about Kursk,
the Polesye Committee and others? We shall do everything we can from here, but
not

    

much can be done from here. There are slight chances of making contact with
Kazan, Siberia, Kursk, Polesye, and Saratov, but all this is problematical. And
yet, if all these live, plus the Urals, were at the congress, then its full lawfulness, even according to Iskra’s reckoning, would be
beyond doubt. Do write.

Yours,

Lenin

Dear friends,


I should like to say a few words to you about congress delegates. If you are
sending them from Russia, then my letter does not apply. But I heard that you
are thinking of giving a mandate to one of the people here. If this rumour is
true, then I would advise giving mandates to both of your candidates
here, i.e., to Josephine and Danila—one with a vote and the other
with a
consultative voice (i.e., write a letter to the congress that the Odessa
Committee requests the congress to let Josephine attend with a consultative voice, as a member of the Southern Bureau and a very useful
worker in a consultative capacity, or, for example, Danila, as having an
excellent knowledge of the local areas and having worked with remarkable energy
among the Odessa proletariat). You may rest assured that the congress will grant
such a request from the Committee. Please read this letter toall the Committee
members and send me a
reply.[1]



P.S. Are you taking workers into the Committee? This is essential, absolutely
essential! Why don’t you put us in direct contact with workers? Not a
single worker writes to Vperyod. This is a scandal. We need at all
costs dozens of worker correspondents. I would ask you to read this
part of the letter, too, not only to all Committee members, but also to all
Majority organisers and agitators.


Regards to everyone!

Yours,

Lenin

In reply to this letter, Lydia Knipovich, a member of the Odessa Committee
of the R.S.D.L.P., informed Lenin that the mandate to the congress
previously issued to V. V. Vorovsky in the name of the Odessa Committee was
being transferred to Lenin and that Vorovsky would receive his mandate from
the Nikolayev Committee.

April 4, 1905


Dear friend,


You wrote yourself that you were now being shadowed. What’s more, I have
gathered information fully confirming this fact from St. Petersburgers who have
recently arrived from the scene of activities. There can be no doubt at all
about it. I know from my own experience and from that of lots of comrades that
one of the, most difficult things for a revolutionary is to leave a danger spot
in good time. Whenever the time comes to drop work in a given locality,
that work becomes particularly interesting and particularly needed; so
it seems always to the person concerned. I consider it my duty, therefore, to
demand of you most insistently that you abandon St. Petersburg for a
time. This is absolutely essential. No excuses of any kind,
no considerations for the work, should put off this step. The harm caused by an
inevitable arrest will be enormous. The harm caused by going away will be
insignificant, and merely apparent. Advance young assistants for a
time, for a month or two, to fill the top posts, and rest assured that,
with an extremely brief and temporary setback, the cause, on the whole, will
gain by it tremendously. The young people will acquire more experience in key
posts, and any mistakes they may make will be speedily corrected by us. An
arrest, however, would ruin all our major opportunities for organising central
work. Once more, I insistently advise going out immediately to the
provinces for a month. There’s heaps of work to be done everywhere, and
everywhere general guidance

    

is needed. If there is a will to go (and a will there
must be) the thing can always be arranged.


I’m not writing anything about the agreement of March 12,
1905.[1]
Cursing will do no good. I suppose they could not act otherwise. The
thing now is to prepare energetically for the congress and to increase the
number of delegates. Don’t be too free with money, take care of it; it
will be needed more than ever after the congress.


 
Notes

Bureau of the Majority Committees concluded on March 12 (25), 1905, on the

Congress of the Party.

Dear Comrade,


I have read with interest your
letter[2] (No. 6) about the primary
nucleus of the organisation among handicraft workers. At the factories this
nucleus should be represented by the factory committee, but what about the
handicraft industries? You stand for trade union circles, but what about your
opponents—? I didn’t quite grasp what they stand for. Neither do I
know, unfortunately, what these old trade union “councils”
were. When did they exist? How were they formed? How did they combine Social-Democratic and trade union work?


Not being familiar with the practical aspect of this practical question, I
hesitate to express an opinion
as yet. Further letters may tell me
more—then we shall see. One must study experience and be careful in
changing things, that is true. But it’s not quite clear to me what Economism has
to do with it. Don’t the factory committees, too, mainly discuss factory
interests (which are also trade union interests)? Yet no one has objected to the
factory committee being the primary nucleus of the Social-Democratic
organisation. The important thing is living conditions, conditions of assembly,
conditions under which people meet, conditions of joint work, because the
primary nucleus should meet frequently and regularly and function in a
particularly lively fashion. Finally, is a single type of organisation
obligatory here? Would not a variety of types be better for adaptation to
various conditions and for acquiring richer experience?

 

Thanks for the letters. Keep on writing, for it is not often
we have news about the day-to-day (the most interesting)
aspect of the work.


Lenin

Geneva, July 8, 1905


Dear Comrades,


Your letter of July 6 somewhat surprised us. You should already have known that
Citizen Plekhanov is no longer the representative of the Russian
Social-Democratic Party in the International Socialist Bureau.


In Iskra No. 101, Citizen Plekhanov published the following letter,
which we translate literally, and
which, one would think, he should
have brought to the notice of the Bureau:



“Comrades, the decisions of the conference [of the breakaway section
of the
Party],[1] which have dealt a mortal blow to the central institutions of our
Party, compel me to divest myself of the title of editor of the Central Organ
and fifth member of the Council (elected by the Second, lawful
Congress).


Plekhanov.



“P.S. I take this opportunity publicly to ask that section of the Party
which recognises the decisions of the ’Third’
Congress[2] as binding,
whether it wishes me to continue to represent this, now—
alas!—dissevered Party in the International Socialist Bureau. I can remain
the representative of the R.S.D.L.P. only if this is the wish of
both sections.

“Montreux, May 29, 1905.”



The editorial board of
Proletary,[3] the Central Organ of
the Party, replied to this statement of Citizen Plekhanov’s with the
following paragraph, published in No. 5, for June 13, 1905:


“In regard to Comrade Plekhanov’s postscript we can
state that the question of the Party’s representation in the

    

International Bureau by Comrade Plekhanov has now been submitted to the C.C. of
the Party for its decision.”


The question has not yet been
settled and, consequently at the
present time Citizen Plekhanov
cannot, in the capacity of
representative of the
Party,[4] sign any document emanating from the International Bureau.


In view of this we draw your attention, dear comrades, to the fact that it is
very inconvenient for us to communicate with the Bureau through a comrade who
himself declares publicly that he cannot represent the Party so long as
it does not definitely authorise him to do so. We again repeat our request to
the International Secretariat that, pending settlement of the question of
representation in the International Socialist Bureau, everything that concerns
us (letters, manifestoes, documents, funds, etc.) should be sent to the address
of the Party’s Central Committee (V. Oulianoff, Rue de la Colline, 3,
Genéve).


Accept, dear comrades, the assurance of our fraternal sentiments.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the Geneva Conference of the Mensheviks held
simultaneously with the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in April 1905.





[2]
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in London from April
12 to 27 (April 25–May 10), 1905, and was attended by 24 voting delegates
and 14 delegates with a consultative voice. It was the first Bolshevik
congress.


All the Congress proceedings were guided by Lenin. He wrote the drafts of
all the basic resolutions adopted by the Congress and spoke on the question
of the armed uprising, on the participation

   

of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary government, on the
attitude towards the peasant movement, on the Party Rules and on a number
of other questions. The Minutes of the Congress record over a hundred
speeches and motions made by Lenin.


The Congress condemned the actions of the Mensheviks, their opportunism in
organisational and tactical questions; it laid down the tactical line of
the Bolsheviks aimed at the complete victory of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution and its development into a socialist revolution. The resolutions
of the Congress outlined the tasks of the proletariat as the leader of the
revolution and the strategic plan of the Party in the bourgeois-democratic
revolution, namely, the proletariat, in alliance with the peasantry, and
with the liberal bourgeoisie isolated , was to fight for the victory of the
revolution.


The Congress amended the Party Rules: a) it adopted Lenin’s wording of
Clause One; b) it defined precisely the rights of the Central Committee and
its relations with the local committees; c) it modified the organisational
structure of the Party’s central bodies: in place of the two centres (the
Central Committee, the Central Organ) the Congress established a single
competent Party centre—the Central Committee.





[3]
Proletary (The Proletarian)—underground Bolshevik weekly,
Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., founded in accordance with a resolution of
the Third Party Congress. By a decision of the plenary meeting of the Party
C. C. of April 27 (May 10), 1905, Lenin was appointed Editor-in-Chief.


Proletary was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) to November 12
(25), 1905. Twenty-six numbers were put out. The newspaper carried on the
line of the old, Leninist, Iskra, and maintained complete
continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod. Lenin wrote over
sixty articles and paragraphs for the newspaper. His articles were
reprinted in the local Bolshevik periodicals and published in leaflet form.






[4]
The question of the R.S.D.L.P.’s representation in the International
Socialist Bureau was discussed in the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. on May 7 (20),
1905. Plekhanov’s appointment as representative of the R.S.D.L.P. in the
I.S.B. was signed by Krasin, Lenin and Postolovsky with a reservation to
the effect that Lenin was instructed to implement this decision in the
event of a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations started with
Plekhanov. Lenin considered recognition of the validity of the Third
Congress, membership of the Party and acceptance of its decisions to be
obligatory on the part of Plekhanov.


The Mensheviks nominated Plekhanov to the I.S.B. at their conference. On
June 16, 1905, Plekhanov notified the I.S.B. that he had been authorised to
represent the Party by both splinter


   

groups and gave a tendentious account of the split in which he denied the
necessity and validity of the Party’s Third Congress.

July 11, 1905


Dear friends,


A number of letters front all over Russia, Alexandrov’s news, a talk
with Tick and several other new arrivals—all this strengthens my
conviction that there is some internal defect in the work of the C.C., a defect
of organisation, in the way the work is arranged. The general opinion is that
there is no Central Committee, that it does not make itself felt, that no one
notices it. And the facts confirm this. There is no evidence of the C.C.’s
political guidance of the Party. Yet all the C.C. members are working themselves
to death? What’s the matter?


In my opinion, one of the principal causes of it is that there are no regular
C.C. leaflets. Leadership by means of talks and personal contacts at a time of
revolution is sheer utopianism. Leadership must be public. All
other forms of work must be wholly and unconditionally subordinate to this form. A responsible C.C. litterateur should concern himself first
of all with writing (or obtaining from contributors—though the editor
himself should always be prepared to write) a leaflet twice a week on Party and
political topics (the liberals, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Minority,
the split, the Zemstvo delegation, the trade unions, etc., etc.) and
republishing it in every way, immediately mimeographing in 50 copies (if there
is no printing press) and circulating it to the committees for
republication. Articles in Proletary could, perhaps, sometimes be used
for such leaflets—after a certain amount of revision. I can not understand
why this is not being done! Can Schmidt

    

and Werner have forgotten our talks on this? Surely it is possible to write and
circulate at least one leaflet a week? The Report on the Third
Congress [1]

has not been
reprinted[2] in full anywhere in Russia all this time. It is so
outrageous, such a fiasco for all the C.C. ’s famous “techniques”
that I simply cannot understand what Winter was thinking about, what Sommer and
the others are thinking about! After all, are there not committee
print-shops in
existence?


Apparently, the C.C. members completely fail to understand the tasks of
“keeping in the public eye”. Yet without that there is no centre,
there is no Party! They are working themselves to the bone, but they are working
like moles, at secret rendezvous, at meetings, with agents, etc., etc. It is a
sheer waste of strength! If you are short-handed, then put third-rate forces on
the job, even tenth-rate ones, but attend to the political leadership
yourselves, issue leaflets first and foremost. And then—personal
appearances and speeches at district meetings (in Polesye no one attend ed the
meeting. A scandal. They all but broke away!), at conferences, etc. Something
like a C.C. diary should be published, a C.C. bulletin, and every important
question should be dealt with in a leaflet issued twice a week. It is not
difficult to publish one: 50 copies can be run off on a hectograph and
circulated, one of the committees can print it and have copies sent to us. The
thing is to act, to act all the time openly, to stop being
dumb. Otherwise we here, too, are completely cut off.


Perhaps the C.C. should be enlarged? Half a dozen more agents taken on? People
could be found for this, I’m sure. In fact, I want to suggest a practical step
right now: in view of the almost total absence of correspondence between the
C.C. members (we have had only two letters from Werner and Winter, and front
Alexandrov only news from the road, “travel impressions, nothing
more), it is absolutely essential to carry out our joint decision of
May 10, 1905, concerning the holding of a meeting by September 1,
19O5.[3]
For heaven’s sake, don’t put this off, don’t be stingy about
spending 200-300 rubles. Without this, there is a great

    

danger that we shall not be able to set things going properly. At the moment
they are not moving at all. This is evident from all reports.


There are still six weeks to go to September 1. It is possible to wind up
affairs and make arrangements for a trip in good time, after corresponding among
others with Alexandrov as to who should go. I await a reply.

Dear friends,


In regard to your recent letters I should say that I agree with all the
decisions except two. 1) I emphatically protest against the appointment of
Matryona as an agent and earnestly request you to revise it. He is a
muddle-headed fellow, who can cause us great harm, desert us a dozen times, put
us to shame by his stupidity, etc. Let him work in the Committee—as an
agent he is no good at all, unless you put him on a “technique”
job. As regards Stanislav, please let me know who he is, tell me more about
him. For my part I would strongly recommend Lalayants as an agent. In Odessa
and the Southern Bureau he displayed outstanding ability as an organiser;
according to the general opinion he has got real live work going there. He was
the guiding spirit of all the local work—so a number of Odessites
reported, some of whom were anything but favourably disposed towards the
“rockfirm”. Last but not least he is a man of exceptionally high
principle. 2) Regarding Plekhanov, I am extremely surprised at your silence on a
question that had been raised here in Winter’s time. Have we the right to
appoint as the representative of the Party someone who does not want to come
into the Party and refuses to recognise the Third Congress? He has now declared
in print that he does not consider the Third Congress lawful and will act as
representative only of both sections. A number of comrades here had
pointed out, when Winter was still here, that, in appointing Plekhanov, we would
only pamper him and spoil him altogether. I was in favour of Plekhanov at first,
but I now see that he can only be appointed on certain

    

conditions. Just imagine concretely what it will mean to have as our
representative on the Bureau someone to whom no one speaks, and who
cannot be made to “represent” the C.C. and not
himself! We have now at last secured direct contact between the Bureau (the
I.S.B.) and us, and we see that there are quite a number of small business matters, financial and others (requests on behalf of Russia and concerning Russia
about which I wrote to them recently; the method of representation,, about which
they asked me a few days ago, etc.). The Bureau wrote about another “proposal of
Bebel’s”[1] (which has not yet reached us); evidently,
the old fellow is out to “make peace” again (Kautsky has published a
mean article in connection with the German edition of the
“Report”[2]). Think what our position will be if
Plekhanov is the representative and Plekhanov has to deal with Bebel on the
question of “peace”! I under stand very well what strong reasons there are
to make us all, and especially you, desire “peace”, desire the
appointment of Plekhanov, but I have become convinced that such a step, without
a real guarantee of peace, will be only a false step, will confuse the
issue still more, will cause new splits, violations of agreements, altercations
and fresh resentment, and will only make unity more remote. In
my opinion, all the talk about unity will be so much empty phrase-making so long
as a realisable plan for it has not been worked out from experience;
things are going in this direction, we must wait a few months, let everyone
assess the absurdity of the decisions of the conference, let experience
destroy their idiotic “organisational statute”, let
experience cut down their claims (for, in general, things are going
better with us, and we are obviously going forward to victory)—and then
direct negotiations will be started between the central bodies without
intermediaries, then we shall work out (whether at once or after two or three
attempts, I do not undertake to say, of course) a modus vivendi. But
now it is necessary to fight,


My proposal is to make a “proposal” to Plekhanov on your lines,
but on condition that he is willing to recognise the Third Congress,
come into the Party and submit to its decisions. By such a Step we 8hall
observe the conventions and eliminate any possible confusion.

 

Pending your reply I shall not propose anything to Plekhanov. I earnestly beg
you to postpone a decision until we meet in September.


I am extremely surprised that you write, nothing about the “Open
Letter”[3] written by Reinert that was sent to me. I
don’t understand the why and wherefor. Why is there not a word about this
in the decisions? Write quickly whether it is to be published in the
Central Organ. If it is, then I should like very much to ask for a slight
alteration concerning tactical differences so that it may not come into
contradiction With my pamphlet, which Lyubich will tell you
about.[4] I hope we shall see eye to eye on this and, if possible, I would ask to be
allowed to make this alteration myself.


I am extremely surprised that the “Report” is not being issued in Russia in
full. It’s scandalous! Make all the technical staff hurry up with this, for
heaven’s sake!


We are extremely grateful for the detailed decisions, letters from committees
and leaflets you have sent us. At long last something like regular contacts
between us are being established! Please, don’t drop this custom and find
a good St. Petersburg secretary. We are badly in need of information from
St. Petersburg about Party affairs, the liberals, questions of Party
life that are being discussed in the circles, etc., etc. Do not forget that the
Bund and the Mensheviks are better informed than we are here!


All the very best.

N. Lenin


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Bebel’s offer to mediate in uniting the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks was
addressed to the International Socialist Bureau after he had received a
negative reply to a similar proposal addressed directly to Lenin on January
21 (February 3), 1905. ^^(See Lenin’s reply, p. 295 of this volume).^^





[2]
The Report on the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and the resolutions
of the Congress were published in the pamphlet Bericht über den III
Parteitag der S.D.A.P.R., München. K. Kautsky wrote an article “Die
Spaltung der russischen Sozialdemokratie” (“The Split in Russian
Social-Democracy”) in Leipziger Volkszeitung, the mouthpiece of
the German Left Social-Democrats (No. 135 for June 15, 1905), against the
circulation of this pamphlet. In reply to Kautsky’s article Lenin wrote his
“Open Letter to the Editorial Board of the Leipziger
Volkszeitung” ^^(see Vol. 8 of this edition)^^, which the editors did
not publish.





[3]
The Open Letter of the C.C. to the Organisation Committee of
the Mensheviks, written by A. A. Bogdanov, was published in
Proletary on August 9 (July 27), 1905 issue No. 11.  
 The C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. proposed to the Menshevik centre—the
Organsation Committee—to enter into negotiations for unity on the
following terms, with the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks preserving
ideological independence: 
 (1) the local committees unite on the basis outlined by the Third
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.; 
 (2) the central bodies come to an arrangement for joint activities
aimed at re-establishing unity; 
 (3) the parallel existence of the Party organs to be preserved. This
plan was criticised by Lenin in his letter to the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. dated August 14, 1905. ^^(see pp. 326–27 of this volume).^^





[4]
In the “Open Letter” the tactical differences between the Bolsheviks
and the Mensheviks were recognised as “insignificant”. The pamphlet here
referred to by Lenin is Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the
Democratic Revolution, on which he worked in the course of June–July
1905. ^^(see Vol. 9 of this edition)^^.

No.1


July 28, 1905


Dear friends,


The two following important questions must be decided as quickly as possible:
1) The question of Plekhanov. We have instructed a
special agent (Lyadov) to tell you how the matter stands. I shall repeat it
briefly. Plekhanov acted with incredible impudence by writing to the Inter
national Socialist Bureau that both sections of the Party had recognised (!)
him, and in every way denouncing and denigrating our Third Congress. I have a
copy of his letter sent to me from the Bureau. It will be sent on to you. With
great difficulty I established direct contact with the International Socialist
Bureau and refuted Plekhanov. Plekhanov then refused to be the
representative. You know that I was by no means unconditionally opposed to Plekhanov’s appointment, but now it would be quite unthinkable. It would be
such a disavowal of me that my position would become impossible. It would
discredit us altogether in the eyes of the International Socialist Bureau. Do
not forget that almost all the Social-Democrats abroad are on the side of the
“icons” and think nothing of us, look down on us. An incautious step
on your part will spoil everything. Therefore I earnestly request Werner and
Schmidt to con firm, as quickly as possible, if only provisionally, the steps I
have taken. That is one thing. Secondly, Plekhanov should be offered a
scientific organ in the name of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., but on condition
that he recognise the Third Congress and all its decisions as binding on him. If
he turns this down, the blame will fall on him, while we shall have demonstrated
our conciliatory spirit. If he accepts, we shall take a further step to meet
him. And so: I earnestly advise you to rescind the decision about
representation,

    

and, as regards the scientific
organ, to draft the proposal with
the above
condition.[1] 2) About the proposal for mediation on the part of the
International Socialist Bureau. The full text will be sent to you, although
Lyadov has already taken it for you. For the purpose of reconciliation, the
International Socialist Bureau proposes a conference between us and the
Minority, under the chairmanship of members of the I. S. Bureau. The foreign
Social-Democrats (Bebel and others) are strongly urging the I.S.B. to bring
pressure to bear on us. Letters of this kind have come even from the British
(the Social-Democratic Federation; I have a copy of the letter, in the usual
conciliatory vein, about it being a
crime to quarrel at such a time,
etc.[2]). I wrote to the I. S. Bureau that it was not within my
competence to settle this question, and that the decision had to come from the
whole C.C., to which, I said, I was writing immediately. Then I enquired
whether they had in mind mediation only, or a court of arbitration that was
binding on both sides; it was important for me, I said, to write on this point
to the C.C. So far there is no reply from them.


My opinion is as follows. The conference should certainly be agreed to. It
should be fixed for round about
September 1. We should send to it without fail
one or two C.C. members from Russia (do not forget that our meeting is fixed for
September 1., and that it is extremely necessary in all respects). Mediation
should be accepted with thanks. A binding decision by arbitration should be
refused on the strength of the Third
Congress
resolution,[3] which
has bound us unconditionally and which states that the conditions for complete
amalgamation with the Minority should be submitted to the Fourth Congress for
confirmation. The Third Congress instructed us to prepare and work out these conditions, but not to endorse them finally. In fulfilment of the instruction of
the Third Congress, we accept mediation and will try to work out a fully
detailed modus for agreement now and for gradual amalgamation. If we can manage
it, we shall implement the agreement at once, and submit the plan for
amalgamation to the Fourth Congress, which will then have to be convened at the
same time and in the same place with the obligatory attendance of all Minority
organisations. It is extremely important to bear in mind

    

that the Mensheviks have no central body whose decisions are binding on
them. Iskra is not subordinated to the Organisation Committee. We
should not play the role of fools entering into an agreement with people who
have neither the right nor the power to speak for the whole Minority. It is
essential therefore to make it clear at once that the delegates from the
Minority at the meeting with the I. S. Bureau should be both from the
Organisation Committee and from Iskra, and in addition should promise
to invite the opinions of all Minority organisations as soon as possible,
giving a list of them to us. Incidentally, if from the point of view of Russia
it is of more importance to you that the Mensheviks of Russia should
preponderate, then you will discuss whether special Iskra delegates are
necessary. You will know best. But do not forget that without the consent of
Iskra all agreements will be a fiction. One more question: should we
in form the I. S. Bureau of the secret resolution of the Third Congress? Have we
the right to do so? I am in doubt about this. Of course, informing the European
socialist comrades is not “publishing”, and they can be made to
undertake not to publish. But is this advisable? Decide for yourselves. It is
easy to give a satisfactory explanation even without informing them about the
Third Congress resolution which binds us.


I shall publish the open letter to the Organisation Committee in Proletary No. 11 (No. 10 is already coming out). I did not publish it earlier
because I was waiting for an explanation from you, which only arrived
yesterday. We earnestly request you to make a note on each document whether it
is to be published and published immediately.


And so, reply as soon as possible on behalf of Werner and Schmidt at any rate:
1) Will you write the reply to the
I. S. Bureau yourselves or do you instruct me to do so?
2) Do you approve my reply or not? 3) If not, I would ask you to hurry up
with a reply, so that we can reach full agreement; any misunderstanding in
such a matter, lack of clarity or lack of information, is fraught with the
greatest danger.


P.S. Please send my letters on to Dubois, I haven’t got his address.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The decision appointing Plekhanov Editor-in-Chief of the party’s
scientific organ was adopted by the C.C. Of the R.S.D.L.P. on May 7 (20),
1905; Lenin was instructed to implement this decision in the event of the
negotiations with Plekhanov being satisfactorily concluded.





[2]
The Social-Democratic Federation, founded in 1884, included within its
ranks representatives of reformism (Hyndman and others), anarchists, and
Marxists representing the Left wing of the British socialist movement. In
1907 it was renamed the Social-Democratic Party; in 1911 this Party and the
Left elements of the Independent Labour Party formed the British Socialist
Party, which, in 1920, together with the Socialist Unity group, played the
chief role in establishing the Communist Party of Great Britain.





[3]
A secret resolution of the Third Congress on the question of
“preparing the terms of unification with the Mensheviks” stated that the
Congress “instructs the C.C. to take steps towards preparing and working
out the terms of unification with the breakaway section of the R.S.D.L.P.,
which terms are to be submitted for final endorsement to a new Party
congress.”  (see The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its
Congresses, Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee, Part I,
1954, p. 90).

August 2, 1905


Dear An. Vas.,


Yesterday I sent you a “business” letter and asked for
Iskra No. 105
[1]

and Plekhanov’s L. Feuerbach
[2]

to be sent to
you. Today I’d like to talk to you on things other than current petty business.


Our people in Geneva are down in the dumps. It’s surprising how little is
needed for people who are not quite self-dependent and not used to independent
political work, to lose heart and start moping. And our Geneva Bolsheviks are
terrible mopers. A serious struggle is on, which the Third Congress, of course,
did not put an end to a-nd merely opened a new phase of it; the Iskrists are
lively busybodies, brazen as hucksters, well skilled by long experience in
demagogy—whereas among our people a kind of “conscientious
stupidity” or “stupid conscientiousness” prevails. They
can’t put up a fight, they’re awkward, inactive, clumsy,
timid.... They’re good fellows, but no damn’d good whatever as politicians. They
lack tenacity, fighting spirit, nimbleness and speed. Vas. Vas. is extremely
typical in this respect: a charming fellow, an utterly devoted worker and honest
man, but he’ll never make a politician, I’m afraid. He’s much too
kind—one can hardly believe that the “Galyorka” pamphlets were
written by him. He brings

    

no fighting spirit either to the newspaper (he is always regretting that I do
not allow him to write kind articles about the Bund!) or to the colony. A spirit
of despondency reigns and I am for ever being reproached (I have only been three
weeks in the country, and travel to town for four to five hours three
and sometimes four times a week!) because things are not going well
with them, because the Mensheviks are smarter, etc., etc.!


And our C.C., for one thing, is not much of a “politician” either,
it’s much too kind, it, too, suffers from a lack of tenacity, resourcefulness
and sensitivity, from inability to take political advantage of every trifle in
the Party struggle. Secondly, it has a lofty contempt for us
“foreigners” and keeps all the best people away from us or takes
them from here. And we here abroad, find ourselves behindhand. There is not
enough ferment, stimulus or impulse. People are incapable of acting and fighting
by themselves. We are short of speakers at our meetings. There is no one to pour
cheer into people, to raise key issues, no one capable of lifting them above the
Geneva marsh into the sphere of more serious interests and problems. And the
whole work suffers. In political struggle a halt is fatal. There are thou sands
of demands and they are continually increasing. The new-Iskrists are not dozing
(they have now “intercepted” the
sailors[5] who arrived
in Geneva, have enticed them, probably by their usual political showmanship and
overloud marktschreien
[3]

, “utilising” post facto the Odessa
events for the benefit of their coterie). We are impossibly short of
people. I don’t know when Vas. Vas. intends to write, but as a speaker and
political centre he is beneath criticism. He is more likely to spread
despondency among people than to rouse them and call them to order. Schwarz is
absent; he writes from over there zealously and well, even better than he did
here, I should say, but that’s all he does. As for personally exercising
an influence on people and being able to direct them and meetings, he is rarely
capable of doing that even when in Geneva. It is a large, important centre
here. There are lots of Russians. Crowds of travellers. Summer is an especially
busy time, for among

    

the multitude of Russian tourists coming to Geneva there is a certain percentage
of people who should and could be made use of, aroused, drawn in and guided.


Think it over and write to me in greater detail (preferably to my private
address: 3. Rue David Dufour). Do you re member writing me that your absence
from Geneva would be no loss, because you wrote a lot even from afar. You do
write a lot, and we keep the newspaper going somehow (just somehow and
no more, though we desperately need a lot more). But not only is there a loss,
but a tremendous loss, which is felt more and more sharply every day. Personal
influence and speaking at meetings make all the difference in politics. Without
them there is no political activity and even writing itself becomes less
political. Faced by an enemy who has powerful forces abroad, we are losing more
ground each week than we can probably make up in a month. The fight for the
Party is not over, and it will not be brought to real victory without straining
every nerve....


All the best.

Yours,

N.Lenin

August 14, 1905


Dear friends,


I have just read in Iskra No. 107 the minutes of the meeting of July 
12, 1905, between the C.C. and the Organisation
Committee.[1] It is
most regrettable that so far the promised minutes have not been
received from you. There have been no letters either. Really, it is impossible
to work in this way. I knew nothing about the plan to issue the “Open
Letter” or the plan of negotiations, or the plan for some sort of
concessions. Is such an attitude to a member of the collegium permissible?
Think of the position you put me in! The position is absolutely impossible, for
it is precisely here, abroad, that I have to answer everybody frankly—you
will admit this yourself on calm reflection.


Your reply to the Organisation Committee gives rise to a number of
perplexities. I can’t make out whether you are trying to be cunning or
what? Can you have forgotten that there is the straightforward resolution of the
Third Congress that the terms 6f unification must be endorsed by a new congress?
How could one talk seriously of co-opting to the C.C. when there are two rival
organs? How could one leave unanswered the toleration of two central organs,
i.e., a complete violation both of the Rules and of the decisions of the Third
Congress? How was it possible not to present the Mensheviks with a principled
ultimatum on the organisational question: (1) congresses instead of
plebiscites as the supreme organ of the Party; (2) unconditional subordination
of Party literature to the Party; (3) direct elections to the C.C.; (4) subordination of the minority to the majority, etc.?

 

Haven’t you taken warning from the unfortunate exam pie of the
transportation “agreement”, which was immediately wrecked by
Frockcoat, causing so much fresh
bitterness?[2] Nothing can do such
harm to the cause of future unity as a fictitious agreement which satisfies no
one and leaves grounds for a struggle; such an “agreement” will
inevitably lead to a new rupture and redoubled bitterness!


Or are you being cunning? Are you hoping to “take in” the
Organisation Committee, or to set the Mensheviks in Russia at loggerheads with
those abroad? Has there not been sufficient experience on this score, proving
the futility of such attempts?


I repeat in all seriousness: you are putting me in an impossible
position. I am not exaggerating. I earnestly request you to answer these
questions: 1) shall we have the meeting on September 1, as we
decided, or have you rescinded this decision? 2) if you have rescinded it, then
how, when and where will your meeting (of C.C. members) be held and what
measures do you intend to take to enable me to cast my vote and (what is
much more important) discover your real intentions. A meeting
is devilishly necessary on a thousand matters. We have no money. The
Germans, for some reason, are not giving any. If you do not send 3,000 rubles,
we shall go under. Practically all the minutes have been set
up,[3] 1,500 rubles are needed for the publication. The treasury is empty as
never before.


What is this resolution of the Orel-Bryansk Committee? (Iskra
No. 106.)[4] There is some muddle here. For
heaven’s sake, tell us what you know. Couldn’t someone be sent
there—Lyubich from Voronezh, for example?


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Menshevik Iskra published the minutes of the meeting
between the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. and the Mensheviks’ centre—the
Organisation Committee—held on July 12, 1905, to discuss unification of
the Party. The Mensheviks proposed a plan, which, considering the
impossibility of convening a Congress, called for unification of the Party
“by means of sufficient mutual concessions by both sections of the
Party”. The plan set forth in the minutes provided for the Organisation of
a Central Committee consisting of representatives of both sections of the
Party, and for retaining Iskra and Proletary as the
official organs of the Party. The


   

representatives of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. found the point concerning
the formation of a Central Committee consisting of representatives of both
sections of the Party acceptable; the question of the functioning of two
organs was postponed pending clarification of the attitude towards this on
the part of the editorial boards concerned; as to the terms in general, the
representatives of the C. C. of the R.S.D.L.P. considered that, although
they did not conflict with the basic principles of the Party Rules, not all
of them were practicable.





[2]
This refers to the agreement concluded by member of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. Leonid Krasin and the Social-Democrat V. L. Kopp (Frockcoat)
arranging for illegal transportation to and from Russia. On the basis of
this agreement V. L. Kopp attempted not only to monopolise the business of
illegal communication with Russia, but to seize some of the property and
literature belonging to the Bolsheviks.





[3]
This refers to the publication of the minutes of the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P.





[4]
The Oral-Bryansk Committee, having heard the report on the Third Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P., did not “consider it possible to take one or another
stand” and recommended the Minority, not represented at the Third
Congress, “to amalgamate with the Party”, declaring that “in the area of
its revolutionary work it would make no distinction between the comrades of
the Minority and those of the Majority, both of which it considered members
of a single Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party”.

Dear An. Vas.,


I have received your letter. You had better write to my private address:
3. Rue David Dufour.


I don’t know what to do about Kostrov’s pamphlet. I have not yet
read it in the press, but from the old manuscript I know what kind of stuff it
is. You are quite right about its being plain “Black-Hundred
literature”.[2] You ask—how to reply?


Vas. Vas. has written a paragraph for Proletary—an uninteresting
one, I don’t feel like publishing it. Olin has delivered a lecture, he is
writing, too, but I don’t think he’ll manage it. Two things are required
here, in my opinion:


firstly, “a brief outline of the history of the split”. A popular
one. Starting from the beginning, from Economism. Properly documented. Divided
into periods: 1901-03; 1903 (Second Congress); August 26, 1903-November 26,
1903; November 26, 1903-January 1904; January-August 1904; August 1904-May 1905;
May 1905 (Third Congress).


I think it could be written so clearly, exactly, and concisely that even those
to whom Kostrov addresses himself would read it.


Secondly, we need a lively, sharp, subtle and detailed characterisation
(literary-critical) of these Black Hundreds. As a matter of fact, this falsity
is at the bottom of things both with L. M. (did you read the disgraceful stuff
in No. 107? Schwarz is replying with an article. I don’t know whether it
is worth while?) and with Old Believer. A number of such articles and pamphlets
should be collected, the gross lie should be shown up, nailed down, so
that it would be impossible to wriggle out of it, and branded as definitely
“Black-Hundred literature”. The new-Iskrists have now provided
plenty of material and if it is carefully gone over and these dirty methods of
tittle-tattle, talebear-

    

ing, etc., are exposed in all their beauty, a powerful effect could be
produced. L. M.’s obscure “personal hints” alone—what
undiluted filth it is!


I may perhaps tackle the first subject myself, but not just now, not soon; I
have no time for it
[1]

(afterwards, I daresay, it will be too late!).


I would not tackle the second subject and I think that only you could
do it. A nasty job, a stinking one, there’s no denying it, but, after all,
we are not fine gentlemen, but newspapermen, and it is impermissible for Social-
Democratic publicists to allow “foulness and poison” to go
unbranded.


Think this over and drop me a line.


A pamphlet on the mass political strike has to be produced—that should
not be difficult for you.


You should certainly continue writing popular pamphlets as well, selecting
something topical. What precisely, I do not know. Perhaps about the Bulygin
Duma? It will be necessary to await the
publication.[3]


It would he good to write about workers’ organisation. Compare our Rules (Third
Congress) and the Conference Statute, analyse the two, explain the idea,
importance and methods of revolutionary organisation of the proletariat
(particularly for an uprising), the difference between Party organisations and
those aligned with the Party, etc. In part, this would be an
answer to Kostrov, a popular one, for the masses, on a burning topic of the
day. Have a try!


All the very best,

Yours,

N. Lenin,


 
Notes
 

[1]
I am now going to answer Plekhanov (Sotsial-Demokrat
No. 2).[4] He
has to be pulled to pieces thoroughly, for he, too, has a heap of abominations
and miserable arguments. I hope that I shall succeed.


Further, I am turning over in my mind a plan for a popular pamphlet: The
Working Class and
Revolution[5]—a description of democratic and socialist tasks, and then conclusions about an uprising and a
provisional revolutionary government, etc. I think such a pamphlet is essential.
—Lenin
 



[2]

“Black-Hundred Literature”—articles of Kostrov (N. Jordania) published
first in Sotsial-Demokrat (organ of the Georgian Mensheviks),
Nos. 1–3, and subsequently in pamphlet form under the title Majority
or Minority?




[4]
Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata (Diary of a Social-Democrat) No. 2 for
August 1905 published Plekhanov’s article “Selected Passages From
Correspondence With Friends (A Letter to the Editors of
Proletary)” in which the author answered Lenin’s article “On the
Provisional Revolutionary Government. Article One. Plekhanov’s Reference to
History” ^^(see Vol. 8 of this edition)^^, and accused Lenin and the
Bolsheviks of Blanquism.





[5]
A plan of the pamphlet The Working Class and Revolution was drawn
up by Lenin ^^(see Vol. 9 of this edition)^^, but the pamphlet on this
subject was not written.





[3]
The manifesto concerning the Bulygin Duma was published on August 6 (19),
1905. On August 29 (16) Proletary published an article of Lenin’s
on this subject entitled “Oneness of the Tsar and the People, and of the
People and the Tsar” ^^(see Vol. 9, pp. 191–99, of this edition)^^.

Today, August 29, 1905, at 8 p.m., copies of the letter from the Geneva group to
the forwarding office and of the reply of the latter to the former reached the
C.C. representative abroad.


In connection with these documents, the representative abroad of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. points out to the Geneva group that it has displayed lack of
understanding of Party discipline and has violated the Party Rules. The
forwarders are agents of the Central Committee. Any dissatisfaction with
C.C. agents is a matter for examination primarily by the Central Committee
itself. According to the Rules, the C.C. deals with all conflicts arising within
the Party, and particularly so in the case of conflicts between members of the
Party’s various organisations and C.C. agents. Therefore, by inviting
C.C. agents to a meeting of the group, the latter took a step that was, formally
speaking, incorrect in general and tactless in particular.


If, however, this invitation was not supposed to be a formal act, then it should
not have been made in writing and officially.


The “personal behaviour” of “officers” is either merely
personal (unconnected with and independent of the office they hold), in which
case its investigation by the group amounts to squabbling; or else, the
personal behaviour

    

has to do with the office, in which case every Party member, who is dissatisfied
with this behaviour, and who insists on a formal, official
investigation, is obliged first and fore most to address himself
formally to the C.C. The Geneva group of the R.S.D.L.P., by allowing questions
concerning dissatisfaction with C.C. agents to “come up” before the group as a
matter of formal examination prior to this being formally
reported to the C.C., has thereby again showed failure to understand the
discipline and Rules of the Party.


The difference I have just mentioned between squabbling and
criticism of an officer (criticism which is obligatory for
every Party member, and which should be made in an open way and addressed
directly to the central institutions or the Congress, and not underhand,
private, parochial criticism), this difference is evidently not clearly grasped
by the group.


The C.C. representative abroad therefore considers it his duty to warn
all young comrades of the group. In the “colonial” conditions of
life abroad people can always be found who are liable to contract the disease of
squabbling, gossip and tittle-tattle, people who very badly fulfil the functions
which the C.C. or the Congress entrusts to them, but who are eager to gossip
about the unsatisfactory fulfilment of other functions by other Party
members. Some comrades, through inexperience, curiosity or spinelessness, may
often listen seriously to these people. Such people, however, should not be
listened to, but should be sharply called to order and not allowed to
raise formal questions concerning the “personal behaviour of
officers” until these questions have been formally submitted for
consideration to the appropriate Party institutions and examined and decided
by them.


Party members abroad easily succumb to the disease I have indicated, but all
young comrades with healthy nerves should keep a strict eye on themselves and
others, for the only way of combating this disease is to see to it that
any inclination towards squabbling and tittle-tattle is immediately and
relentlessly nipped in the bud.


That is why the C.C. representative abroad has decided:


I. To request the Geneva group to withdraw its letter of
August 28 to the forwarding office.

 

This would be the best and speediest way of ending a bad business which, by the
very force of events, threatens to lead to the most unpleasant quarrels and
rifts.


The group is not obliged, of course, to meet the request which I am
making in the name of the C.C. I venture to make this request
because I am dealing with comrades, with whom so far I have, never had
any formal conflict.


II. Should the group reject my request then point I of
the decision falls away. In that case, I propose that the group:


1.) Inform me whether it intends to comply with the Party Rules as explained
  above, i.e., to comply with the decision made by me in the name
  of the C.C. (an appeal against this decision can be made (a) at a full
  meeting of the C.C. or (b) at a Congress, but it is binding until an nulled by
  a higher body).


  2) Send me, in accordance with Clause 11 of the Party
Rules, all information concerning the make-up of the group and “all its
activities” (votings, etc.) in connection with the present unfortunate
business.


N. Lenin,

the Representative Abroad

of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.

At the request of Comrade Vas. Vas. I am explaining the passage he indicated in
my decision (that people can be found who do their work badly, but who are eager
to gossip about the shortcomings of others). The suggestion that I meant to
accuse someone, etc., is without grounds. Every Party worker has his
shortcomings and drawbacks in the work, but we must be careful that
criticism of short comings or their examination at the central Party bodies does
not overstep the boundary where tittle-tattle begins. The whole point and
substance of my decision are meant to serve as a warning and a
request that an immediate stop be put to a matter that has been wrongly
and badly begun.

Dear An. Vas.,


Your plan for a pamphlet on Three Revolutions pleased me
immensely. I’d drop the reply to Plekhanov for the time being if I were
you—let that enraged doctrinaire bark away to his heart’s
content. To delve specially into philosophy at such a time! You must work as
hard as you can for Social-Democracy—don’t forget that you are committed for your entire working time.


As for the Three Revolutions, tackle this straight away. This subject has to be
dealt with in a thorough manner. I am sure you could make a success of
it. Describe, in a popular way, the tasks of socialism, its essence and the
conditions for its realisation. Then—victory in the present revolution,
the significance of the peasant movement (a separate chapter), what could
now be regarded as complete victory; a provisional government,
revolutionary army, uprising—the significance and conditions of
new forms of struggle. Revolution a la 1789 and a la
1848. Finally (better to make this the second part and the preceding
one—the third), about the bourgeois character of the revolution, more
fully about the economic aspect, then thoroughly expose the
Osvobozhdeniye people in all their interests, tactics and political intrigue.


This is a rich theme indeed, and a militant one, against the Iskra
vulgarisers. Please tackle it at once and take your time over it. It is
extremely important to produce a popular thing on this subject, something
forceful and pointed.


Now about the split. You misunderstood me. It’s no use your waiting for me, for
these are different subjects: one is

    

the history (we shall try to manage that); the other—an outline of their
polemical methods. A literary-critical out line on the subject, let us say, of
“cheap and shoddy literature”. Here an analysis is to be given in a
whole pamphlet of several chapters, with quotations, showing up all this
disgusting claptrap of Old Believer, Martov and the rest in their polemic with
Proletary, as well as the rehash of this theme in “Majority or
Minority”, etc. Pillory them for their paltry method of
warfare. Make them into a type. Draw a full-length portrait of them by
quotations from their own writings! I am sure you’d pull it off, if only you
collect a few quotations.


All the very best.

Yours,

Lenin


P.S. I have received the article about Kuzmin-Karavayev. Also the 1848 feuilleton.

September 7, 1905


Dear friends,


Today I received news of your agreement to a conference on the Duma with the
Bund, the Letts,
etc.[2] Only today, although the thing happened a
month ago! It is left for me to write you another “protest” (an
occupation which, it seems, is becoming my profession)....


Definitely, I shall accuse you formally before the Fourth Congress of the crime
called “restoration of duocentrism in defiance of the Rules and will of
the Party”. Really, I shall. Just think—is it not duocentrism that
you have introduced! I am obliged ex officio to run the organ of the
Central Committee. Is that not so? But how can I do that when I do not get a
scrap of writing on any question of tactics, and a for-r-r-rmal enquiry
about the “pre-arranged” meeting on September 1 (new style) is left
without reply! Just think what the outcome will be if there is disharmony
between us! Is it so difficult to get someone to write in good time, if only on
matters of “state importance”?


I have written about the Duma in Nos. 12, 14 and 15 of Proletary. I am
also writing in No. 16, which will come out on September 12
(new style)[1]

. In
Posledniye Izvestia (September 1, new style, No. 247) the Bund talked
itself popeyed. We’ll give them a whipping they won’t forget till

    

they’re able to sit up again. These Bundists are such dolts and trumpeters, such
nitwits and idiots, they are the limit! Iskra has got tangled up in
lies, especially Martov in the Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung (August 24, new
style—translation in Proletary No. 15). For heaven’s
sake, don’t rush in with an official resolution and do not give way an
inch to this Bundist-new-Iskrist conference. Is it true that there will be no
minutes? How can one possibly confer with these prostitutes without minutes?


I strongly warn you against the Armenian Social-Democratic
Federation.[3]
If you have agreed to its participation in the conference, you have made a
fatal mistake, which must
be rectified at all costs. It is
represented in Geneva by a couple of disrupters who publish sheer trivia here
and have no serious connections with the Caucasus. It is a Bund
creatura, nothing more, specially invented to cultivate Caucasian
Bundism. If you allow these people to attend a Russian Conference, that
is, a conference of organisations working in Russia, you will get yourself into
a terrible mess. All the Caucasian comrades are against this gang of disruptive
writers (I know this from many people); and we shall soon trounce them in
Proletary. You will only
evoke protests from the Caucasus and a
fresh squabble instead of “peace” and
“unity”. For pity’s sake! How can one ignore the Caucasian
Union, which is working so hard in Russia, and hobnob with the dregs of the
Geneva marsh! I beg you most earnestly, don’t do it.


I have received the decision about dividing the money equally with the
Organisation Committee. It will be carried out to the letter.


All the best.

N. Lenin

Mensheviks, of the Bund, of the Lettish Social-Democrats, of the
Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania and the Revolutionary Ukrainian
Party. The Conference approved the Bolshevik tactics of active boycott of
the Bulygin Duma. The Conference decisions were assessed by Lenin, in his
articles “The First Results of the Political Alignment” and “The
Hysterics of the Defeated” ^^(see Vol. 9 of this edition)^^. The
Mensheviks refused to sign the resolutions of the Conference.

The Armenian Social-Democratic Federation—a nationalist
organisation formed in 1903, shortly after the Second Congress of the

proletariat; like the Bundists, it recognised only the federative principle
of party organisation.

September 14, 1905


Dear friend,


I hasten to reply to your pessimistic letter. I cannot verify the facts, but it
seems to me that you are exaggerating; that’s the first point. The
C.C. ’s leaflets are good, and Rabochy No. 1 is very
good.[1]
This is a big thing. At the moment financial affairs are bad, but
connections exist and the prospects are very good. One big enterprise, very
solid and profitable, has been set up, so the
“financier”[2]
is certainly not asleep. The second point: you take a wrong view
of things. To wait until there is complete solidarity within the C.C. or among
its agents is utopian. “Not a circle, but a party”, dear friend!
Focus attention on the local committees; they are autonomous, they give
full scope, they free one’s hands for financial and other connections, for
statements in the press, and so on and so forth. Mind you don’t make the
same mistake you are blaming others for; don’t moan and groan, and if you
don’t like working as an agent, push on with committee work
-and urge those who think like you to do the same. Assuming that you do have
differences of opinion with the “agents”. It is far more advisable
 for you to get your views accepted in the committee, especially if it is a
 united, principled committee, and to conduct an open, straightforward, vigorous
 policy in it than to argue with the “agents”. If you are right
 about the anaemia of the committees and a plethora of “agents”, the
 remedy for this malady is in your own hands: flock into the committees. The
 committee is autonomous. The committees decide everything at
 congresses. The committees can pass resolutions. The committees have the

    

right to go into print. Don’t sit idle, looking up at the
“heads”, but get down to business on your own. You now have a broad,
free field and independent, rewarding work in a most important committee. Throw
yourself into it, pick a willing team, approach the workers boldly and widely,
run off leaflets, order them from us, Schwarz, me, Galyorka, loudly
voice your Party opinion in the name of the committee. In this way, I assure
you, you will do a thousand times more to influence the whole Party and the
C.C. in the direction you desire than by bringing personal influence to bear on
the agents and members of the C.C. It strikes me that you are looking at things
in the old parochial way, and not from the Party standpoint. The C.C. is
elective, the congress is not faroff, you have your rights, make use of them and
bring all energetic, resolute sup porters on to the same road: into the
committees! Pressure must be brought to bear formally, through the committees,
and not personally through talks with the agents. No one is obliged to be an
agent if he wants to work in the committees!


You write that the agent Myamlin stated that Iskra’s
Khlestakovian report is
fair.[3] Very well. That is his
right. But in Letuchy Listok No. 1, the C.C. stated that two-thirds
of the Party is on our side. That means that Myamlin has hit out at himself!
Your job is to curb the Myamlins and expose and discredit them through your
own committee, and not through talks with them. The committees will elect
people who appoint the Myamlins, but it is not the Myamlins who decide the fate
of the Party. Let energetic people capture the committees: there you have a
slogan for all, which I advise you to spread, to drum into people’s heads
and to implement.


The agent Myamlin stands for two central organs. Again:
who will decide? The committees and their delegates to the fourth
congress. Prepare one, two or more committees—there you have a rewarding
and practical task. Suppose the Myamlins are victorious. The
committees have the right to start their own organ of the press, even a
single committee! That is why you err and drift into the old, pre-party point of
view when you write: “They are printing Trotsky’s leaflets”
(there is nothing wrong in that if the leaflets are fairly

    

good and vetted. I advise the St. Petersburg Committee, too, to print his
leaflets vetted, say, by you), or when you write: “A fall from grace
à la Boris is imminent.” I don’t understand it. Suppose there
are Borises. This junk is always plentiful. Suppose the Borises and Myamlins
prove to have the majority (of the committees, don’t forget that,
of the committees). Then “all the preceding work is
undone”, you conclude. Why? How can Proletary become undone,
what can cause its undoing? Even the absurdity of “two central
organs” will not cause the undoing of Proletary, it will only
introduce absurdity into the Rules. Life will only preserve Proletary
and sweep away the absurdity. Even the Myamlins will not dare to close down
Proletary. And finally, let us assume the worst of possible endings,
in the vein of your pessimism: suppose the closing down does take place. I shall
then ask: what is the St. Petersburg Commit tee for? Is it likely that Proletary will be weaker as the organ of the St. Petersburg Committee than as
one of “two” central organs? Take immediate energetic measures to
have the St. Petersburg Committee establish not formal, but business-like,
close, permanent ties with Proletary, and you will strengthen your
position and the impact of your ideas so much that you will defy a hundred
Myamlins. The St. Petersburg Committee is a force three times as great as all
the “agents” put together. Make Proletary the organ of the
St. Petersburg Committee and the St. Petersburg Committee the thorough-going
executor of the ideas and tactics of Proletary; there you
have a real struggle against Myamlinism, and not a struggle by
complaints and groaning. Hundreds of addresses can be found in St. Petersburg,
and a host of opportunities for organising workers’ correspondence,
revitalising contacts, placing orders for leaflets, republishing articles from
Proletary in leaflet form, retelling them in leaflets, re-writing them
in the form of leaflets, etc., etc. Leaflets can and should deal also with
general Party problems (the other day the Kostroma Committee sent us a
resolution against Plekhanov being appointed to the International Bureau: a
downright smack in the eye, and no mistake!). Myamlinism must be combated by
exemplary organisation of committee agitation, by militant
leaflets to the Party and not by wry complaints to the C.C.!

 

What article of mine in No. 5 (?) of Zarya (on Prokopovich) are
you referring

to?[4] I am puzzled. Why are you dissatisfied with
Ruben? Put me in direct touch with him and Lalayants without fail.


All the very best. Write oftener and cheer up! The Myamlins be damned!


Yours,
N. Lenin

Letuchie Listki (Leaflets) of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P.—a non-periodical publication dealing with current tactical and
organisational questions in keeping with the decisions of the Third
Congress of the Party. Altogether four numbers were put
out. Listok No. 1 was printed in June 1905 at the print-shop of
the St. Petersburg Committee of the Party and reprinted in abridged form in
July by the Moscow Committee of the Party.


Rabochy (The Worker)—an illegal popular Social-Democratic
newspaper, published in pursuance of the decision of the Third Congress of
the Party by the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in Moscow in
August–October 1905. The de facto editor of the paper was A. A. Bogdanov.

[3]
The report of the Menshevik Iskra published in the French
socialist newspaper Le Socialiste No. 11, dealt with the attitude
of the local Party organisations to the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. Iskra declared that the Congress was recognised as
lawful by only eight organisations of the R.S.D.L.P. (Tver, Tula,
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Orel, Kursk and Minsk) uniting
2,000,000–2,500,000 workers; 25 organisations,


   

according to Iskra, did not recognise the Congress; in four
organisations the Congress was recognised by a minority, and the attitude
to the Congress on the part of nine organisations was unascertained. Since
this false information was not given by Iskra to the press in
Russia, Lenin published in Proletary No. 9, for July 26 (13),
1905, under the heading “Our Khlestakovs” a full translation of the
article printed in Le Socialiste with his introductory and
concluding comments. The statistics concerning the committees of the
R.S.D.L.P. which allegedly “refused to recognise” the Third Congress of
the Party were also dealt with by Lenin in his article “Keeping
International Social-Democracy Informed of Our Party Affairs” published in
Proletary No. 15, for September 5 (August 23), 1905 ^^(See Vol. 9
of this edition)^^.

September 20, 1905


Dear friend,


Thanks for letter No. 3. We may publish part of
it.[1] You have made a
start with the talks with the editorial board not merely on formal questions (on
the Rules, contacts, addresses, and so on), not only on subjects for reportage
(such and such events occurred), but on the subject of the gist of your
views, your understanding of our tactics, and how precisely
you put these tactics into effect in lectures, at meetings, etc. Such
talks between practical workers in Russia and ourselves are extremely
valuable to us, and I request you most earnestly to advocate, remind and insist everywhere that anyone who wants to consider the Central Organ his
own C.O. (and every Party member should want that), should not restrict
himself to formal answers or reports, but should talk with the
editorial board about the views he is advocating, talk not for
publication, but to create an ideological connection. To regard such talks
as a mere pastime is to lapse into narrow-minded practicalism and leave to
chance the entire principled, ideological aspect of all our practical work, all
agitation, for without a clear, well-thought-out
ideological content agitation
degenerates into phrase-mongering. And to work out a clear ideological content
it is not enough to be merely a contributor to the C.O., it requires also joint
discussions about how the practical workers understand one or other
proposition, how they are putting into actual practice particular
views. Without this, the editorial board of the C.O. is left in the air, it will
not know whether its advocacy is

    

accepted, whether there is any response to it, how practical life modifies it,
what amendments and additions are needed. Without it, Social-Democrats will
sink
to a level where the writer scribbles and the reader reads from time to
time. Consciousness of connection with the Party is still weak among us, it
has
to be strengthened by word and deed.


I shall try to make use of your example by publishing part of your letter. On
the whole we are in agreement and see eye to eye with you (your ideas coincide
with mine in Two Tactics). In particular, it seems to me that you are
wrong in attacking the Mensheviks for the words “preparation of the
masses for an uprising”. If there is a mistake here, it is not a
cardinal one.


All the very best.

Yours,
Lenin

I received your Letuchy Listok No. 2 for June 24, 19O5, only today,
October 3, 1905, new style. (It takes the “United Centre”
three months to inform its members....)


The article: “Fundamentals of Party Organisation” is very good. I
can imagine what it’s like to have to chew over the ABC to the Mensheviks! But
you have to. The writer of the article has made an excellent job of it. I am
thinking of publishing it in
Proletary.[1] It is late, of
course, but better late than never.


This article has set me thinking that you can and should see to it that the
C.C. is not mute but always articulate. The time is past for ideological
leadership through “whisperings” in secret meeting places and
rendezvous with agents! Leadership should be through political
literature. Rabochy is not suitable for that, it has a different role
to perform. You must decidedly issue a C.C. bulletin in a format not
exceeding two printed pages, but you should issue it twice a
week. It would contain a short article on a political, tactical or
organisational subject, then brief, minor items of three lines each. Only (1) it
must be printed, for the hectograph is now very bad (is there not some small
equipment that operates rapidly?) and (2) it must be done punctually
and frequently.


Your plan of converting Rabochy into a smaller weekly newspaper is not
clear to me. In my opinion, a popular organ is one thing (I am not in favour of
it, but the Congress decided on it, so that’s that), and a
bulletin of really guiding political articles of a general kind is
another. You have three or four good contributors, so it would be as easy as
anything to get two small articles every week, and the significance would be
tremendous!

October 3, 1905


Dear friends,


I have received a pile of documents and listened to Delta’s detailed
story. I hasten to reply on all the points.


1) I shall not be able to come at the scheduled time, as there can be no
   question of my leaving the newspaper
now.[1] Voinov is stuck in
   Italy. Orlovsky had to be sent away on business. There is no one to replace
   me. Therefore the thing is being postponed until Russian October, as arranged
   by you.


2) I repeat my most urgent request that you send a formal reply to the
   International Bureau. As to whether you are sending someone to the conference
   abroad. Exactly whom and when. As to whether you are appointing some
   one—also precisely. Otherwise you will discredit yourselves incredibly
   in the eyes of the International Bureau.


3) About Plekhanov, also formally and conclusively—yes or no. Who should
   be appointed? Postponement of this question is extremely
dangerous.[2]


4) About legal publishing, make a formal decision quickly. My draft agreement
   with
Malykh,[3] has done you no harm whatever, as it is only a
   draft. I merely repeat that Malykh provided a livelihood for lots of people
   here, whom the Party is enable to maintain. Do not forget that. I would
   advise both concluding an agreement with Malykh and continuing to do business
   with the others after the manner of Schmidt.


5) As regards opposition to the C.C. on the part of almost all the agents, I
   have the following to say. Firstly, co-opting Insarov and Lyubich, which I
   fully welcome, will probably

    

improve matters very much. Secondly, some of the agents are evidently
exaggerating somewhat. Thirdly, would it not be advisable to put some of the
agents on the commit tees with instructions to concern, themselves with the
whole area of two or three neighbouring committees? Unity of tactics should not
be overestimated: a certain variety in the actions and plans of the committees
will do no harm.


6) I consider it extremely important
to start preparing for the fourth
congress.[4] It is high time. It will probably be six months late
   at least, if not more. All the same, it is high time. I think we are a little
   to blame for the laxity among some of the committees and for allowing them to
   waive the decisions of the Third Congress concerning the conditions of
   admission for the Mensheviks. If these committees, which at one and the same
   time recognise and do not recognise the Third Congress, do not define their
   attitude to the fourth congress, there will be chaos. Some of them will not
   attend the fourth congress. Another scandal. Some of them will attend it and
   desert to the other side at the congress. We should not confuse the policy of
   uniting the two parts with the mixing-up of both parts. We
   agree to uniting the two parts, but we shall never agree to mixing them
   up. We must demand of the committees a distinct division, then two congresses
   and amalgamation. Two congresses at the same time, in one place, and they
   will discuss and accept the drafts for amalgamation prepared beforehand.


But just now we must vigorously oppose any mixing-up of the
two sections of the Party. I would advise giving the agents a watchword of this
kind in the most definite form and instructing them to put it into effect.


If this is not done there will be an unholy mess. The Mensheviks have everything
to gain by confusion and they will go out of their way to breed it. They
won’t be “any the worse for it” (since nothing can be worse
than their disorganisation), whereas we value our organisation, embryonic
though it is, and will defend it tooth and nail. It pays the Mensheviks to mix
things up and make another scandal out of the fourth congress, for they are not
even contemplating a congress of their own. We must direct all our
efforts and all our thoughts towards cementing and

    

better organising our section of the Party. These tactics may seem
“egoistic”, but they are the only reasonable ones. If we are well
united and organised, if we get rid of all the whiners and turncoats, then our
hard core, even if not very large, will carry with it the whole mass of
“organisational nebulosity”. But if we have no such core, the
Mensheviks, having disorganised themselves, will disorganise us as well. If we
have a hard core, we shall soon force them into amalgamation with us. If we have
no core, then it will not be the other core (it is non-existent) that will win
the day, but the muddleheads, and then, I assure you, there will be
fresh squabbles, a fresh, inevitable split and resentment a hundred times worse
than before.


So let us prepare for real unification by increasing our own strength
and working out clear drafts for standards of rules and tactics. And
the people who chatter idly about unification, who mix up the relations
between the sections of the Parry, should, in my opinion, be ruthlessly removed
from our midst.


All the best.

Yours,
N. Lenin

[4]
The Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in
Stockholm on April 10–25 (April 23–May 8), 1906.


It was attended by 112 voting delegates representing 57 local organisations
and 22 delegates with a consultative voice. There were, in addition, three
representatives each from the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and
Lithuania, the Bund, and the Lettish S.D.L.P. and one each from the
Ukrainian S.D.L.P. and the Labour Party of Finland, and a representative of
the Bulgarian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Bolshevik delegates
included, among others, V. I. Lenin, F. A. Artyom (Sergeyev), M. V. Frunze,
M. I. Kalinin, S. G. Shahumyan, and V. V. Vorovsky.

   

The principal items on the agenda were the agrarian question, the current
situation, the class tasks of the proletariat, the attitude to the Duma,
and organisational questions. On all issues a sharp struggle was waged
between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Lenin made reports and speeches
on the agrarian question, the current situation, on the question of tactics
in regard to the Duma elections, on the armed uprising and other questions.


The Mensheviks’ numerical preponderance at the Congress, though slight,
determined the character of the Congress decisions. On a number of
questions the Congress adopted Menshevik resolutions (the agrarian
programme, the attitude towards the Duma, etc.). The Congress adopted
Lenin’s formulation of Clause One of the Party Rules concerning membership
of the Party. The Congress admitted into the R.S.D.L.P. the non-Russian
Social-Democratic organisations of Poland and Lithuania and the Lettish
Social-Democratic Labour Party, and made arrangements for the Bund to join
the R.S.D.L.P.


The Central Committee elected at the Congress consisted of three Bolsheviks
and seven Mensheviks. Only Mensheviks were elected to the editorial board
of the Central Organ.


An analysis of the Congress is given in Lenin’s pamphlet Report on the
Unity Congress the R.S.D.L.P. ^^(see Vol. 10 of this edition)^^.

October 5,1905


Dear friends,


I have just received Reinert’s new letter. I have gone carefully into his
proposal, talked it over with Delta and revised my negative reply in the letter
of October 3, 1905.


I can return Orlovsky in a week’s time. They could then, perhaps, manage
without me somehow for a week or two. I would write a few articles in advance
and do some writing during the journey. But your plan, nevertheless, seems to me
highly irrational. According to the news now filling the foreign press, feeling
in Finland is running very high. It is openly reported that a number of
outbreaks are imminent and that an uprising is being prepared. Troops are being
sent there in force. The coastal and naval police have been reinforced
fourfold. After the John Grafton
incident,[1] special
attention is being paid to ships approaching the coasts. Arms have been
discovered in many places and the search for them has been stepped up. It is
considered within the bounds of possibility that clashes will be deliberately
provoked to provide a pretext for using armed force.


To arrange a general meeting there under such circumstances means taking a
quite unnecessary risk. It would be an absolutely desperate undertaking. A
trifling accident (the likelihood of which in Finland now is particularly great)
would be enough to wreck everything, both the C.C. and the C.O., for then
everything here would go to pieces. We must face the facts: it would mean
handing over the Party wholly to the Menshevik leaders to be torn to pieces. I
am sure that when you have thought the matter over you will agree that we are
not entitled to do that.

 

Please discuss whether the p]an could not be altered in the following way. All
of us to meet in Stockholm. Compared to the present plan this would mean for you
some slight inconveniences and tremendous advantages. The inconveniences lie in
the half-a-day’s delay (counting from Abo, near which it is proposed to
meet) or a maximum of one day each way. Two days in all, possibly even 4
days. That is a mere trifle. The advantages are greater safety. A total
break-down would then be ruled out completely. That means we shall not in the
slightest jeopardise the C.O. and the whole C.C.; we shall not be doing anything
stupid or desperate. Some of you can travel quite legally; they cannot be
arrested. The rest will obtain passports of other people or will travel without
passports (Delta says it is easy for the Finns to arrange for crossing the
frontier). In the event of an arrest being made, it would be, firstly, an
isolated case and not wholesale break-down and, secondly, there would be
absolutely no evidence, so that in the event of legal proceedings it would be
impossible for the police to dig up anything serious. We are then guaranteed
meeting for two to three days in complete safety, with all the documents
available (I shall bring them with me and you will send yours by post, etc.),
and with the possibility of drawing up any minutes, manifestos, etc., that we
like. Finally, we would then try out whether I could travel to Stockholm more
frequently, in order to work for you and for the leaflets, etc., from there (the
Mensheviks, I believe, did something of the kind in the South).


Please discuss this plan carefully. If you approve, send me a telegram
addressed: Kroupsky, 3, rue Dawid Dufour, Genève, signed Boleslav with just a
number indicating the date when I ought to be in Stockholm (30=I should be
there by September 30; 2 or 3=1 should be there by October 2 or 3, and so on).


All the best.
N. Lenin

October 8, 1905


Dear friends,


I hasten to inform you of an important change that has taken place in regard to
representation on the International Bureau. The South-Russian Conference
of
Mensheviks[2] adopted a resolution on this question in which (1)
there is a gross lie about me personally. I am replying in No. 20 of
Proletary[1]

, which will come out the day after tomorrow; (2) they ask Plekhanov
to represent their section of the Party.


This is exactly what we need! Plekhanov, of course, will accede to their
request. His quasi-neutrality, which is so disastrous to us, will be shown up,
and that is just what we wanted to prove. Let there be two representatives on
the International Bureau: one from the Majority and one from the Minority. That
will be the best thing. Moreover, if Plekhanov represents the Minority that
will be better still. It is an excellent precedent for future unity. I earnestly request you: abandon now all thought of Plekhanov and appoint your own
delegate from the Majority. Only then will our interests be fully taken care
of. It would be good to appoint Orlovsky. He knows languages, he is a good
speaker, and an impressive personality. Most contacts are by writing, almost
all of them, and we, of course, would begin consultations. As a matter of fact,
there would be nothing to consult about: I assure you from experience that this
representation is a mere formality. At one time

    

Plekhanov often entrusted this representation to Koltsov
and no harm ever came of it, although Koltsov was no good
at all as a “parliamentarian” and an impossible, clumsy
lout in general.

 All the best.
N. Lenin

The South-Russian Inaugural Conference of the Mensheviks was held
in Kiev in August 1905. It was attended by twelve delegates from Menshevik
groups and committees. The Conference adopted resolutions on the following
questions: amalgamation of both sections of the Party; the Duma; the
composition of Iskra editorial board; representation of the
R.S.D.L.P. in the International Socialist Bureau; the Articles of
Association, and others.


Lenin sharply criticised the decisions of the Conference in his articles
“A New Menshevik Conference” and “The Latest in Iskra Tactics,
or Mock Elections as a New Incentive to an Uprising”^^(see Vol. 9 of this
edition)^^.

October 14


Dear An. Vas.,


Your article deals with a subject that is extremely interesting and very
timely.[2] Recently, in a leading article, Leipziger
Volkszeitung[3] ridiculed the Zemstvo members for their
September Congress, for “playing at a Constitution”, for
already posing as parliamentarians, etc., etc. The mistake of Parvus
and Martov needs analysing from this aspect. But your article gives no
analysis. I believe the article should be revised along one of two lines: either
the weight of emphasis should be shifted to our new-Iskrists, who are
“playing at parliamentarism”, and you should demonstrate in detail
the relative, temporary importance of parliamentarism, the futility of
“parliamentary illusions” in an era of revolutionary struggle, etc.,
by explaining the whole thing from the beginning (for Russians this is very
useful!) and introducing a bit of
Hilferding,[4] just by way of
illustration; or else you should take Hilferding as a
basis—the article will then need less revision—give it a different
heading, but describe more clearly Hilferding’s method of presenting the
question. Of course, you may find another plan of revision, but please set to
work on it at once, without fail. You have time for it, since the article could
not go into this issue (the Moscow
events[5]+ the old material
have taken up all the space). So, the deadline is Tuesday, October 17. Please
make it a comprehensive article and send it by October 17. It would be better
to revise it along the first lines, it may then turn out to be an editorial!


If we already had a parliament, we would certainly support the
Cadets,[6]
Milyukov and Co. contra Moskov-

    

skiye Vedomosti. For example, when balloting, etc. Such action there would
not in the slightest degree violate the independence of the class party of
Social-Democracy. But in an era not of parliament, but of revolution (you make
the distinction in the very heading), support for people who are incapable
of fighting in a revolutionary way is 1) violation of the independence of
our Party. The deal cannot be clear and above-hoard. It is precisely the
“sale” of our right to revolution, as you say, and not the
use of our right for the purpose of support. In a parliament we give
support without in any way disappearing. Now we are disappearing by
obliging the Milyukovs to speak for us on definite
terms. Further, what is most important 2) such support is betrayal of the
revolution. There is no parliament as yet, it is only an illusion of
the Milyukovs. We must fight in a revolutionary way for a parliament,
but not in a parliamentary way for a revolution; we must fight in a
revolutionary way for a strong parliament, and not in an
impotent “parliament” for a revolution. In Russia now,
without the victory of the revolution, all victories in
“parliament” (the Duma or the like) are nothing, worse than
nothing, for they blind the eyes by a fiction. Parvus has not
understood this.


The Cadets have already become
regierungsfähig[1]
 (the Trubetskois and
Manuilovs in the role of rectors, etc.), they have already climbed to the second
storey of freedom of assembly (at the price of debasing assemblies), the storey
of quasi-parliamentarism. All they need is that the proletariat, while
remaining actually in the basement, should imagine itself on the second
storey, should fancy itself a parliamentary force and agree to
“conditions” about “support” and so on. That is a rich
theme! We now are strong owing to the revolutionary struggle of the people and
weak in a quasi-parliamentary respect. With the Cadets it is just the
reverse. They calculate on dragging us into
quasi-parliamentarism. Iskra has allowed itself to be fooled. It is on
this point that a detailed analysis of the relation of
“‘parliamentarism’ to revolution” would be appropriate (cf. Marx on
the class struggles in France in
1848).[7]

 

These ideas outlined by you (I am stating them, of course, in a very general and
inexact way) must be amplified, mulled over, and served up. People in Russia are
now badly in need of having the relation between parliamentarism and revolution
explained to them from the very beginning. But Martov and Co. go into hysterics
and scream: if only we would become legal! If only we would act openly! It
doesn’t matter how, so long as it’s legal! It is now of all times that we
need steadfastness, the continuation of the revolution, struggle against a
wretched semi-legality. Iskra has failed to understand this. Like all
opportunists, they do not believe in the energy and stubbornness of the workers’
revolutionary struggle. Moscow is a lesson to them. And here we have that
vulgarian Parvus applying to Russia the tactics of petty deals!


Did you receive my letter? All the very best to you and to An. Al.


Yours,
Lenin

Constitutional-Democratic Party, the chief party of the liberal-monarchist
bourgeoisie in Russia. Founded in October 1905, its membership was made up
of representatives of the bourgeoisie, Zemstvo leaders of the landowning
class and bourgeois intellectuals. The Cadets called themselves the “party
of people’s freedom”. Actually they strove towards a deal with the
autocracy in order to preserve tsarism in the form of a constitutional
monarchy. Their watchword from the beginning of the imperialist war was
“war to a victorious finish”. After the February revolution of 1917, as a
result of a deal with the S.R. and Menshevik leaders of the Petrograd
Soviet, they occupied key positions in the bourgeois Provisional Government
and pursued a counter-revolutionary policy opposed to the interests of the
people.


After the victory of the October Revolution the Cadets came out as
implacable enemies of the Soviet power. They took part in all the
counter-revolutionary armed actions and campaigns of the
interventionists. Living abroad as émigrés after the defeat of the
interventionists and whiteguards, the Cadets did not cease their
anti-Soviet activities.

October 13, 1905


Dear friend,


The resolution of the Odessa Committee on the trade union struggle
(“decisions” No. 6 or 5—it is not clear; in letter No. 24. It
is dated September 1905) seems to me highly erroneous. The excitement of the
struggle against the Mensheviks naturally explains this, but one must not fall
into the other extreme. And that is just what this resolution does. I venture,
therefore, to make a critical analysis of the Odessa Committee’s
resolution, and would ask the comrades to discuss my remarks, which are in no
way due to a desire to find fault.


The resolution is in three (unnumbered) parts in the preamble, and five
(numbered) parts in the resolution proper. The first part (the opening paragraph
of the preamble) is quite good: to undertake “leadership of all
manifestations of the class struggle of the proletariat” and “never
to forget the task” of leading the trade union
struggle. Splendid. Further, the second point, that the task of preparing for
an armed uprising comes “into the forefront”, and (the third or
final point of the preamble) “in consequence of this the task of leading
the trade union struggle of the proletariat inevitably recedes into the
background”. This, in my opinion, is wrong theoretically and incorrect
from the point of view of tactics.


It is wrong theoretically to equate the two tasks as if they were on
the same level: “the task of preparing for an armed uprising” and
“the task of leading the trade union struggle”. The one task is said
to be in the forefront, the

    

other in the background. To speak like that means comparing and contrasting
things of a different order. The armed uprising is a method of political
struggle at a given moment. The trade union struggle is one of the constant
forms of the whole workers’ movement, one always needed under capitalism and
essential at all times. In a passage quoted by me in What Is To Be
Done?[1] Engels distinguishes three basic forms of the
proletarian struggle: economic, political, and theoretical—that is to
say, trade union, political, and theoretical (scientific, ideological, and
philosophical). How can one of these basic forms of struggle (the trade union
form) be put on a level with a method of another basic form of struggle
at a given moment? How can the whole trade union struggle, as a
“task”, be put on a level with the present and by far not the
only method of political struggle? These are incommensurable things,
something like adding tenths to hundredths without reducing them to a common
denominator. In my opinion, both these points (the second and third) of the
preamble should be deleted. Alongside “the task of leading the trade union
struggle” can be put only the task of leading the general political
struggle as a whole, the task of waging the general ideological struggle as a
whole, and not some particular, given, modern tasks of the political or
ideological struggle. In place of these two points mention should be made of the
necessity of never for a moment forgetting the political struggle, the education
of the working class in all the fullness of Social-Democratic ideas, and the
need to achieve a close, indissoluble connection between all manifestations
of the workers’ movement for creating an integral, truly Social-Democratic
movement. This indication could be the second point of the preamble. The third
could mention the necessity of warning against the narrow conception and narrow
formulation of the trade union struggle, which are zealously disseminated by the
bourgeoisie. I am not, of course, putting forward a draft for the resolution, I
am not touching on the question whether it is worth while making special mention
of this; for the time being I am merely examining what expression of your
thought would be theoretically correct.


Tactically, the resolution in its present form puts the case

    

for an armed uprising rather lamely. An armed uprising is the highest method of
political struggle. Its success from the point of view of the
proletariat, i.e., the success of a proletarian uprising under Social-Democratic
leader ship, and not of any other kind of uprising, requires extensive
development of all aspects of the workers’ movement. Hence the idea of
contraposing the task of an uprising to the task of leading the trade union
struggle is supremely incorrect. In this way the task of the uprising is played
down, belittled. Instead of summing up and crowning the entire workers’
movement as a whole, the result is that the task of the uprising is dealt with
as a thing apart. Two things are, as it were, mixed up: a resolution on the
trade union struggle in general (this is the subject of the Odessa
Committee’s resolution), and a resolution on the disposition of forces in
the present work of the Odessa Committee (your resolution goes off on this tack,
but that’s quite another pair of shoes).


I pass on to the numbered points of the part comprising the resolution proper.


Ad I. “To expose the illusions” “which are bound up with the
trade unions”... this is more or less passable, although it were best
deleted. Firstly, it belongs to the preamble, where the inseparable connection
of all aspects of the movement should be pointed out. Secondly, the nature of
the illusions is not stated. If this is to be inserted at all, there should be
added: bourgeois illusions as to the possibility of meeting the economic and
other needs of the working class in capitalist society.


...“strongly emphasising their [the unions’?] narrowness compared with the
ultimate aims of the workers’ movement”. It follows that all trade unions
are “narrow”.
What about Social-Democratic trade unions which are linked with the
political organisation of the proletariat? The crux of the matter is not that
trade unions are “narrow”, but that this one aspect (and narrow just
because it is one aspect) should be bound up with others. Consequently, these
words should either be thrown out or further mention should be made of the need
to establish and strengthen the connection between one aspect and all
the others, the need to imbue the trade unions with Social-Democratic
    

content, Social-Democratic propaganda, and to draw them into
all Social-Democratic work, etc.


Ad II. All right.


Ad III. For the reasons stated, it is incorrect to compare the task of the trade
unions with the “most urgent and primary task” of an armed
uprising. There is no need to speak of the armed uprising in a resolution on the
trade union struggle, for the former is a means for the “over throw of the
tsarist autocracy” which is mentioned in point II. The trade unions could
broaden the basis from which we shall draw strength for an uprising, so that, I
say once again, it is erroneous to contrapose one to the other.


Ad IV. “To wage a vigorous ideological struggle against the so-called
Minority”, which is reverting to “Economism” “in
problems of the trade unions”. Isn’t this too general for a
resolution of the Odessa Committee? Doesn’t it seem an exaggeration? After
all, there has been no criticism in the press of any resolution of the
Mensheviks on the “trade unions” . It has merely been pointed out that the
liberals praise them for a tendency to fall over backwards in their seal on this
question. The only [inference] to be drawn from this is that we too must show
zeal, without however “falling over backwards” in the attempt. I
think this point should either be deleted altogether, leaving only a warning
against narrowness and mentioning the struggle against the tendencies of the
bourgeoisie and liberals to distort the tasks of the trade unions, or it should
be formulated specially in connection with some particular resolution of the
Mensheviks (I do not know of such resolutions at the present time, unless some
kind of Akim resolutions appeared among you in the South).


Ad V. Now this is the real thing. The words “and, if possible,
leadership” I would replace by “and leadership”. We do
everything “if possible”. The insertion of these words here of all
places may be misinterpreted in the sense that we strive less for leadership,
etc.


Generally speaking I think we should be careful not to exaggerate the struggle
against the Mensheviks on this issue. This is probably just the time when trade
unions will soon begin to spring up. We must not stand aloof, and above all not
give any occasion for thinking that we

    

ought to stand aloof, but endeavour to take part, to influence, etc. For there
is a special section of workers, elderly family men, who will make very little
contribution to the political struggle at present, but very much to the trade
union struggle. We must make use of this section, merely guiding their steps in
this field. It is important that at the very outset Russian Social-Democrats
should strike the right note in regard to the trade unions, and at once create a
tradition of Social-Democratic initiative in this matter, of Social-Democratic
participation, of Social-Democratic leadership. In practice, of course, there
may not be enough forces, but that is quite another question; even so, given an
ability to make use of all the available forces, some will always be found for
the trade unions as well. Forces have been found for writing a resolution on the
trade unions, i.e., for ideological guidance, and that’s the crux of the
matter!


I wish you all the best and ask you to drop me a line about receipt of this
letter and about your thoughts in connection with it.


Yours,

N. Lenin

October 26, 1905


Dear Beastie,


I received your long letter a few days ago. Many thanks. We get very little news
from St. Petersburg, and few leaflets of any kind. Please do not abandon your
intention to send us absolutely all news of every kind as well as
correspondence.


As regards Party affairs, it seems to me that your pessimism is a bit
exaggerated. I judge by things over here. I continually hear from the
“periphery” that Proletary is obviously on the decline,
that things are going from bad to worse, that the newspaper is running to seed
and so on and so forth. But things are not as bad as they seem. With the
gigantic movement that there is now, no single C.C. in the world, under
conditions where the Party is illegal, could satisfy a thousandth part of the
demands made on it. That our slogans, the slogans of Proletary, are
not just a voice crying in the wilderness, can be clearly seen even from the
legal newspapers, which report meetings of 10,000-15,000 in the University,
etc. My word, our revolution in Russia is a fine one! We hope to return there
soon—things are heading that way with remarkable speed.


We shall certainly arrange a meeting with the C.C. This question is already
settled and everything has been arranged.


As regards differences of opinion, you seem to be exaggerating too. I see no
disagreements here between Proletary and the C.C. Timing the uprising?
Who would undertake to fix it? Personally, I would willingly postpone it until
the spring, and until the Manchurian army comes home; I am inclined to think
that in general it will be to our advantage to postpone it. But, then, nobody
asks us any way. Take the present tremendous strike.

 

That the C.C. is focussing its attention on leadership through the press is, in
my opinion, the right tactics. I only wish that in addition to Rabochy,
which is very useful at the present time, we had
agitational bulletins, small ones of two, or a maximum of four, pages,
lively, frequent, issued at least once a week, and sometimes twice. With the
present gigantic, incredible growth of the movement, the Party can be led only
through the press. And we must produce lively, mobile, speedy, brief
leaflet-bulletins, giving the main slogans and the results of the main events.


Concerning stoppage of the Central Organ, there is a misunderstanding here. They
were afraid of the whole business going bankrupt, but had no intention
of suppressing the C.O. Generally speaking the importance of the foreign-based
section of the Party is now diminishing hour by hour, and this is
unavoidable. We shall not abandon Proletary, of course, under any
circumstances, until we can get it published in Nevsky Prospekt in
St. Petersburg. But we must now pay a great deal of attention to a legal
newspaper as well. We here abroad already have to put the shutters up
(propagandist literature), and we shall soon close down altogether and open up
in St. Petersburg.


In preparing for the uprising, I would advise at once carrying out extensive
propaganda everywhere for the organisation of a large number, hundreds
and thousands, of autonomous combat squads, very small ones (from
three persons upwards), which would arm themselves as best they can and
prepare themselves in every way. The time of the uprising, I repeat, I would
willingly postpone until the spring, but it is difficult, of course,
for me to judge from a distance.


All the very best.

Yours,
N. Lenin

Please write to me immediately whether you authorise me to invite Plekhanov on
to our broad Editorial Committee (the 7-man one) and the editorial board of
Novaya
Zhizn.[1] Wire
(signature—Boleslav. Address—Krupskaya): yes or no. I shall make
another attempt at a rapproachement with him, although there is not much hope.

Novaya Zhizn (New Life)—the first legal Bolshevik daily
published in St. Petersburg from October 27 (November 9) to December 3(16),
1905. Lenin took over the editorship upon his return to Russia early in
November 1905. Novaya Zhizn was, in effect, the Central Organ of
the R.S.D.L.P. Closely associated with the paper were V. V. Vorovsky,
M. S. Olminsky and A. V. Lunacharsky. Maxim Gorky contributed articles and
gave the paper financial aid. The paper’s circulation reached 80,000.



Novaya Zhizn was constantly persecuted. Fifteen of its
twenty-seven issues were confiscated and destroyed. It was banned after the
publication of No. 27. The last issue No. 28 came out illegally.

Dear Georgi Valentinovich,


I am writing this letter to you because I am convinced that the need for
Social-Democratic unity is a question that can no longer be put off, and the
possibility for it is now greater than ever. Two reasons prevent me from further
postponing a direct approach to you: 1) the founding of a legal
Social-Democratic newspaper, Novaya Zhizn, in St. Petersburg, and 2)
the events of the last few
days.[1] Even if these events do not
lead to our returning to Russia very soon, at any rate this return is now very,
very near, and the Social-Democratic newspaper provides an immediate basis for
the most serious joint work.


That we Bolsheviks earnestly desire to work together with you is something I
need hardly repeat to you. I have written to St. Petersburg asking all the
editors of the new newspaper (at present there are seven of them: Bogdanov,
Rumyantsev, Bazarov, Lunacharsky, Orlovsky, Olminsky and myself) to send you a
joint and official request to join the editorial board. But events will not
wait, postal communication is interrupted, and I do not think I am justified in
postponing an essential step for what is really a mere formality. In fact, I am
absolutely sure of general agreement and joy on account of this proposal. I am
very well aware that all Bolsheviks have always regarded disagreement with you
as something temporary, due to exceptional circumstances. It goes without
saying, the struggle often involved us in steps, statements and actions which
were bound to make future unity more difficult, but there has always been a
readiness on our part to unite, a consciousness of the extreme
abnormality of the best force among Russian

    

Social-Democrats standing aloof from the work, a consciousness of the entire
movement’s extreme need of your guiding, close and immediate
participation. And we all firmly believe that if not today, then tomorrow, and
if not tomorrow, then the day after, our union with you will come about despite
all difficulties and obstacles.


But it would be better if it were today rather than tomorrow. Things have now
taken such a turn that we may be too late, and we intend to exert every
effort not to be late.


Would you care to work together with us? I should be extremely glad if you would
agree to meet me and talk this over. I am confident that a personal meeting
would remove many misunderstandings, and many seeming difficulties in the way
of unity would vanish at once. But should you not agree in general, or not agree
just now, I venture to take the liberty of touching on some of these
difficulties in advance.


These difficulties are: 1) Your disagreements with many members of the new
editorial board. 2) Your disinclination to join either of the two halves of the
Social-Democratic Party.—The first difficulty, I think, is wholly
removable. We are in agreement with you on approximately nine-tenths of the
questions of theory and tactics, and to quarrel over one-tenth is not worth
while. You wanted, and still want, to correct some assertions, which you regard
as erroneous, in my writings. But nowhere at any time have I gone out of my way
specially to impose my views on any Social-Democrat, and none, positively none,
of the new editors has entered into an engagement to be
“Leninist”. Barsov’s speech at the Third Congress was an
expression of the general view in this respect. You consider that the
philosophical views of three of the seven persons mentioned are
erroneous.[2] But these three, too, have not attempted, and are not
attempting, to link these views of theirs with any official Party matter. And
these three—I am not speaking at random but on the basis of precise
knowledge of the facts—would be extremely glad to work jointly with
you. For you and us to part company politically now, at a time when your general
sympathy with the views of the Majority is known, among other things, from your
lecture, is evident from your latest writings, and is evident indi-

    

rectly from the position adopted by Parvus, who is perhaps most in agreement
with you—to part company politically now would be extremely undesirable,
extremely inopportune, and extremely harmful for the Social-Democratic
movement.


And a new legal newspaper, which will have an audience of tens, if not hundreds,
of thousands of workers—indeed, all the coming work in Russia at a time
when your immense knowledge and vast political experience are terribly needed by
the Russian proletariat—all this will provide new ground, on
which it will be so much easier to forget the past and work together on a real
live job. To pass from work in Geneva to work in St. Petersburg is a transition
that is exceptionally favourable, psychologically and from the Party
standpoint, for going over from disunity to unity, and I very much hope that we
shall not miss such an opportunity, which has not occurred since the Second Congress and which, probably, will not occur again so soon.


Here, however, is the second difficulty. Perhaps you do not want unity with one
half of the Party. You will demand unity of the whole Party as a conditio
sine qua non for your participation in the work. You are quite right in
holding that such unity is desirable and necessary. But is it possible at
present? You yourself are inclined to answer this in the negative, for not
long ago you were proposing a federation. Today the broadest tribune
for our influence on the proletariat is a daily newspaper in
St. Petersburg (we shall be in a position to issue it in an edition of 100,000
copies and bring the price down to one kopek). Is a joint editorial board with
the Mensheviks conceivable at present? We think it is not. And so do
the Mensheviks. And so do you, judging from your proposal for a federation. Are
three newspapers really necessary? Cannot we get together for a
political organ of revolutionary Social-Democracy when there are really
no organisational disagreements between us, and the Party’s coming out
into the open tomorrow will dispel all lingering fears about conspiracy. And the
revolution itself will sweep away our tactical differences with astonishing
speed; besides, you have not expressed any disagreement with the
resolutions of the Third Congress;

    

and these resolutions, after all, are the sole Party directive that
unites all of us Bolsheviks.


It seems to me that under such circumstances your coming over to us is fully
possible, and it will not make future unity more difficult, but will rather
facilitate and accelerate it. Instead of the present struggle, which is being
protracted owing to your standing aloof, the revolutionary Social-Democratic
movement as a whole will be in a stronger position. The struggle, too, will
gain by it by becoming steadier, more disciplined. The general body of Social-
Democrats will at once feel confident, hopeful—a different atmosphere will
immediately be created, and the new newspaper, hour by hour, will win for itself
a leading position in the Social-Democratic movement, without looking backwards,
without going into details of the past, but only firmly and steadfastly leading
the working class in the present arena of struggle.


I conclude by once again asking you to agree to meet me and by expressing the
general confidence of us Bolsheviks in the usefulness, importance and necessity
of working jointly with you.


Sincerely yours,


V. Ulyanov

Dear Comrades,


I have received your “Letter to the Comrades”. I shall not publish
it—indeed you do not ask me to do so. But I consider it my duty to reply
to you. I have more than once stated in print what I am repeating to you now. It
is useless to complain and mourn over the split. We must work hard to
do away with it, we must think how to unite, and not indulge in
platitudes and lamentation. Complaining about the struggle of two
parties and creating a third, and a secret one at that, as you
have done, hiding yourselves from both organisations—means
intensifying the split. If you have been expelled for violating the
rules of the organisation, it serves you right, and it’s no use trying to
muddle things by making out that you were expelled for your opinions, for your
conciliatory attitude, and not because of your disruptive activities.


An “inaugural congress” is an empty phrase. Just think
a bit, the tiniest little bit, what groups precisely should
send their delegates, and how many from each? Just think
a tiny bit how you would react to the idea of an inaugural
meeting without a basis of voting rights. Would you not
call it charlatanry?

 

Why do you say nothing about the idea of two congresses, that of the
Majority and the Minority, held at the same time and in the same place? This
idea was put forward by the C.C. and by
Proletary.[2] Would
it not be easier to hold two congresses from the existing two parties
than to start by creating a third (on which you will waste
months, if not years) and then to convene three
congresses? What idiot is going to submit to an “inaugural congress”
without? knowing beforehand whether the Social-Democrats will really be
represented there, which of them exactly, and in what proportions?


The slogan of “two congresses” has in its favour 1) the assent of
one party of the two; 2) full readiness for a congress on the part of the
Majority and the fact that its standards for convocation and the
rights of its congress were made known; 3) the possibility of achieving
the same thing very rapidly in the groups and organisations of the
other party: by publicly listing all groups, getting their opinions,
and publishing draft rules of the congress.


But all that your slogan of an “inaugural congress” has in its
favour is the whining of certain whimperers, for not a single section
of the Party knows the basis of this congress in any respect
whatever. You are simply people of little faith and weak nerves. The sight of an
unclean disease and ugly pimples has made you turn away. This is understandable,
humanly speaking, but irrational. We think that one must not turn away, that a
third party will not get us anywhere, whereas the two existing ones will unite
after all, albeit not at once and not without painful treatment.

Wednesday, August 14, 1907


Dear Alexei Maximovich,


We arrived here today with Meshkovsky and tomorrow we are going to
Stuttgart.[1] It is very, very important that you, too, should be
there.[2] For one thing, you were appointed officially by the
C.C. (with a consultative voice). Secondly, it would be very good to see you, as
it may be a long time before we meet. Thirdly, it is only a matter of a
day’s journey from where you are and it will last not more than a
week (it is not London!). It will not be at all late if you leave on Sunday or
even Monday.


In short, everything is in favour of your coming. I wish you would, health
permitting. Don’t miss this opportunity of seeing the international
socialists at work—it is something quite, quite different from a
general acquaintance and mere chatting. The next congress will not be held for
another three years. Besides, we shall never be able to discuss all our business
by mail unless we meet. In short, come without fail. Au revoir!


My best regards to Maria
Fyodorovna.[3]


Yours,
N. Lenin

Dear An. Vas.,


I have received your pamphlet at last—the first part arrived quite a long
time
ago.[1] I kept waiting for the end so as to read it as a whole,
but I waited in vain. So far the third supplement is still missing (“How
Marx Regarded”, etc.). This is most unfortunate for, not having the
complete manuscript, one is afraid of giving it to the press to be set up. If
this third supplement has not been sent yet, please try to send it as quickly as
possible. The money (200 rubles) has been sent to you; did you receive it?


As regards the content of your pamphlet, I liked it very much, as did all our
people here. A most interesting pamphlet and excellently written. The only
thing is, there are many unguarded statements, so to speak—I mean the kind
of things which various S.R.s,
Mensheviks, syndicalists, etc., will pick
on. We discussed collectively whether we should touch it up or give an
explanation in the preface. We decided on the latter course, as it would be a
pity to touch it up; it would impair the integral character of the exposition.


The conscientious and attentive reader will be able to understand you correctly,
of course; nevertheless, you should specially guard yourself against
false interpreters, whose name is legion. For example, we must of course
criticise Bebel, and I do not approve of Trotsky, who recently sent us a hymn of
praise to Essen and German Social-Democracy in general. You are right in
pointing out that in Essen Bebel was wrong both on the question of militarism
and on the question of colonial policy (or rather on

    

the character of the radicals’ fight
at Stuttgart on this
subject).[2]
But it should be mentioned in this connection that these are the mistakes
of a person with whom we are going the same way, and which can only be rectified
in this, Marxist, Social-Democratic way. For there are many people among us (you
probably do not see their press) who maliciously chuckle over Bebel for the
sake of glorifying Socialist-Revolutionarism, syndicalism (à
la Yezersky, Kozlovsky, Krichevsky—see Obrazovaniye,
etc.) and anarchism.


In my opinion, all your ideas can and should always be set forth in
such a way that criticism will be aimed not at orthodoxy, not at the Germans in
general, but at opportunism. Then it will be impossible to
misinterpret you. Then the conclusion will be clear, namely, that Bolshevism,
taking a lesson from the Germans and profiting by their experience (this demand
of yours is a thousand times correct!), will take all that is vital
from syndicalism in order to kill Russian syndicalism and
opportunism. To do this is easier and more natural for us Bolsheviks than
for anyone else, for in the revolution we have always fought against
parliamentary cretinism and Plekhanovite opportunism. And it is we alone who,
from the revolutionary and not from the pedantic Cadet standpoint of Plekhanov
and Co., can refute syndicalism, which produces no end of confusion
(particularly dangerous confusion in the case of Russia).


Proletary No. 17 has come
out and has been sent to you, and so
has
Zarnitsy.[3] Have you received them? Do you read
Tovarishch? How do you like it now? What about your remembering old
times and poking fun at them in verse? Write please.


All the very best.

Yours,
Lenin


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the pamphlet by A. V. Lunacharsky (Voinov) on the attitude
of the Party towards the trade unions, which was written in connection with
the discussion of this question at the Seventh, Stuttgart, Congress of the
Second International. Lunacharsky attended the Congress as a member of the
Russian delegation and a representative of the Bolsheviks. He was elected
to the committee that drafted a resolution on the question of “the
relations between political parties and the trade unions”.


Lunacharsky’s pamphlet was not published owing to the tightening of the
censorship in 1908. ^^See Lenin’s preface to the pamphlet in Vol. 13 of
this edition.^^





[2]
This refers to the Essen Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party,
held on September 21–23, 1907, at which Bebel came out against
Karl Liebknecht, who had criticised Noske’s chauvinist stand and the whole
behaviour of the German delegation at the Stuttgart Congress. Bebel also
came out against Rosa Luxemburg and all the German Left wingers for the
“methods” (i.e., for their bloc, with the Bolsheviks) which they adopted
at the Congress in their struggle against the social-chauvinists and
social-imperialists.





[3]
Proletary—a Bolshevik illegal newspaper, edited by Lenin,
published from August 21 (September 3), 1906 to November 28 (December 11).
1909. Altogether 50 issues were put out. Proletary,


   

in effect, was the Central Organ of the Bolsheviks. The paper devoted a
good deal of space to tactical and general political questions, and
published reports on the activities of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., the
decisions of conferences and C.C. plenary meetings, C.C. letters on various
questions of Party activity, and a number of other documents. The paper was
in close touch with the local Party organisations.


During the years of the Stolypin reaction Proletary played an
important role in preserving and strengthening the Bolshevik organisations
and combating the liquidators, otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders.


By a decision of the plenary meeting of the Party’s C.C. of January 1910
the paper was closed down.


Zarnitsy (Summer Lightning)—a Bolshevik legal symposium,
published in St. Petersburg in 1907.

January 9, 1908, Geneva


Dear Al. M.,


My wife and I arrived here a few days ago. We both caught cold on the way. We
are settling down here just anyhow, for the time being temporarily, so
everything is bad. I was very glad to have your letter: it would really be fine
to make a trip to Capri! I shall definitely find time one of these days to visit
you. At present, unfortunately, it is impossible. We have come here with the
commission to establish a newspaper: to transfer Proletary here from
Finland. We haven’t decided yet finally whether we shall choose Geneva or
some other city. In any case we must hurry and we have our hands full with the
new arrangements. It would be nice to pay you a visit in the spring or summer,
when things here are well under way! What is the best time for Capri?


How is your health? How do you feel? Does your work go well? I heard while
passing through Berlin that you and Lunacharsky have been touring Italy and, in
particular, have been in
Rome.[1] Do you like Italy? Do you
meet many Russians?


It would be best for me to visit you when you are not engaged on anything big,
so that we can wander about at leisure and chat together.


Have you received my book (the first volume of collected articles for
twelve
years)[2]? I asked for it to be sent to you from St. Petersburg.


My very best regards to Maria Fyodorovna. Au revoir!


Yours,
N. Lenin


My address is: Mr. Wl. Oulianoff,
17, Rue des deux Ponts, 17, (chez Küpfer), Genève.

January 15, 1908


Dear A. M. and M. F.,


I received your express letter today. The idea of dropping in on you on Capri is
delightfully tempting, dash it! You have painted such an attractive picture that
I have definitely made up my mind to come out, and I shall try to bring my wife
with me. Only I am still uncertain about the date; at present I must give all my
attention to Proletary, it must be established and work got
going smoothly at all costs. That will take a month or two at least. But it must
be done. By the spring we shall find ourselves drinking the white wine of Capri,
looking at Naples and chatting with you. Incidentally, I have begun to study
Italian and, as a learner, I pounced at once on the address written by Maria
Fyodorovna: expresso instead of espresso! Let’s have
that dictionary!


As for the shipment of Proletary, you have brought it on your own head
by writing. You won’t be able to wriggle away from us now so easily! A
heap of commissions have to be given straight away to M. F.:


1) To find the secretary of the union of steamship employees (there must be
such a union!) serving on steamers that maintain communications with Russia.


2) To find out from him where the ships come from and go to,
   and how often. He must arrange weekly shipments for us
   without fail. How much will that cost? He must find someone for us who is
   punctual (are there punctual men among the Italians?). Will they
   want an address in Russia (in Odessa, say, for delivering the newspapers or
   could small quantities be kept temporarily with some

    

Italian innkeeper in Odessa? This is extremely important for us.


3) If M. F. cannot take care of this herself—making all the arrangements,
finding the necessary people, instructing them, checking, etc., let her be
sure to put us in touch with this secretary—we shall then write to him
directly.


This thing is urgent. In two or three weeks’ time we hope to publish
Proletary here and it will have to be dispatched at
once[1]


Well—until we meet on Capri! Now, A. M., take care of yourself.


Yours,
V. Ulyanov


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Arrangements for delivering Proletary to Russia through Gorky and
Andreyeva were made in the early months of 1908, but hitches occurred owing
to police interference. In a letter to Morgari, socialist M. P. editor of
Avanti!, Gorky wrote at the beginning of May 1908, that two
parcels containing the newspaper Proletary had been sequestered in
Genoa and asked for an explanation of this “strange
misunderstanding”. Gorky’s letter was published in Avanti! on
May 5 (18), and on May 25 the newspaper reported that the ban on
Proletary had been lifted.

January 29, 1908


Dear Comrade,


About two-and-a-half to three months ago in Finland I received your letter with
the reminder about the debt, which I handed over to the
C.C.[2] Now
the “Finnish smash-up” has compelled me to move to Geneva, involving
consider able time and trouble. Today one of the comrades here has told me that
you are insistently reminding about the debt and that the Englishman is even
threatening publication in the press (!), etc.


I shall immediately write again to Russia to say that the debt must be
repaid. But, you know, it is extremely difficult to do this now! The
Finnish smash-up, the arrests of many comrades, the seizure of papers, the need
to remove printing-presses and to send many comrades abroad—all this has
entailed heavy and unforeseen expenditure. The Party’s financial
plight is all the more unfortunate because during two years everyone has grown
out of the habit of working illegally and has been “spoilt” by legal
or semi-legal activities. Secret organisations have had to be organised almost
afresh. This is costing a mint of money. And all the intellectualist, philistine
elements are abandoning the Party; the exodus of the intelligentsia is
enormous. Those remaining are pure proletarians who have no opportunity of
making open collections.


It should be explained to the Englishman and brought home to him that the
conditions at the time of the Second Duma when the loan was made were quite
different, that the Party will, of course, pay its debts, but it is impossible,
inconceivable to demand this just now, that it would be usury, and so
on.

 

We must convince the Englishman. It is hardly likely
he will be able to get the money. And making a row will
lead him nowhere.


If I am not mistaken, the members of the factions signed
separately and the responsibility is by factions too.


All the best.

Yours,
N. Lenin


P.S. Not knowing your address, I have written to Quelch, asking him to
obtain some literature. I am extremely grateful to him; I’m
afraid he can’t always make out my terrible English!


My address is: VI. Oulianoff, 17, Rue des deux Ponts, Genève.

Rothstein, Theodore Aronovich (1871–1953)—a Social-Democrat. In
1890 he was compelled to emigrate from Russia. Settled in England joined
the English Social-Democratic Federation where he adhered to its Left
wing. Joined the R.S.D.L.P. in 1901. Contributed to the Russian and foreign
socialist press. Took part in founding the Communist Party of Great
Britain. Returned home in 1920. From 1921 to 1930 engaged in diplomatic
work, afterwards Director of the Institute of World Economy and World
Politics. From 1939 an Academician.





[2]
During the Fifth (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (April 30–May 19 [May
13–June I], 1907), owing to the Party’s extremely difficult financial
position, a loan was raised with the help of Maxim Gorky and
George Lansbury, the money being advanced by an English soap manufacturer
and was to be repaid by January 1, 1908. The loan not being repaid in time,
the lender wrote to Theodore Rothstein, reminding him about it,

   

and the latter, then a member of the English Social-Democratic Party, wrote
to Lenin about it.


After the October Revolution the Soviet Government, through L. B. Krasin,
repaid the debt to the lender’s heirs who returned the letter acknowledging
the debt signed by all the participants of the Congress.

February 2, 1908


Dear A. M.,


I am writing to you about two matters.


Firstly, about the Semashko affair. If you do not know him personally,
it is not worth while your intervening in the matter described below. If you do
know him, it is worth while.


L. Martov made a “statement” in the Berne Social-Democratic
newspaper to the effect that Semashko was not a delegate at the Stuttgart
Congress, but merely a journalist. Not a word about his being a member
of the Social-Democratic Party. This is a vile attack by a Menshevik on a
Bolshevik who is in prison. I have already sent my official statement as the
representative of the R.S.D.L.P. in the International
Bureau.[2] If
you know Semashko personally, or knew him in Nizhni-Novgorod, you should write
without fail to the same newspaper saying that you are shocked at
Martov’s statement, that you are personally acquainted with Semashko as a
Social-Democrat, and that you are sure that he is not implicated in the affairs
inflated by the international police. I am quoting below the news paper’s
address and the full text of Martov’s statement, which M. F. will
translate for you. Write to the editors yourself in Russian, and ask M. F. to
append a German translation.


The second matter. All three of us have come together here now, having been sent
from Russia to establish Proletary (Bogdanov, I and one
“Praktik”). Everything is in running order, in a day or two we shall
publish an
announcement.[3] You are on our list of
contributors. Drop us

    

a line as to whether you could give us something for the first issues (something
after the manner of your “notes on philistinism” in
Novaya Zhizn, or fragments from a story you are
writing[4],
etc.


All the very best. Best regards to M. F.!

Yours,
V. Ulyanov


The following was published in Berner
Tagwacht[5]
(address of the editorial office: Kapellenstrasse 6, Bern. Social-Democratic organ) No. 24, January 30, 1908.


“Erklärung. In einigen Zeitungen stand zu lesen, dass der
unlängst in Genf verhaftete D-r Simaschko ein Delegierter der Genfer Gruppe der
russischen Sozialdemokratie in Stuttgart gewesen sei. Dem gegenüber erkläre
ich, dass D-r Simaschko nicht Mitglied der russischen Section auf dem genannten
Kongresse war und kein Delegiertenmandat besessen hat. Er war dort nur als
Journalist tätig.


“L. Martoff, Delegierter der russischen Sozialdemokratie auf dem
Stuttgarter Kongress.”
[1]



That’s all. The disgusting thing about it is that Social-Democracy indirectly, as it
were, shakes the dust off its the feet, and repudiates Semashko!


 
Notes
 

[1]

“Statement. Some newspapers reported that Dr. Semashko,
recently arrested in Geneva, was a delegate in Stuttgart of the Russian
Social-Democratic group in Geneva. In contradiction to this, I declare that
Dr. Semashko was not a member of the Russian section at the said Congress and
had no delegate’s mandate. He was there only in the capacity of
journalist.


“L. Martoff, delegate of Russian Social-Democracy at the Stuttgart Congress. —Ed.

 



[2]

N. A. Somashko was arrested in Geneva at the end of January 1908. Lenin’s
statement was published in the newspaper Berner Tagwacht No. 29,
for February 5, 1908.





[3]
The announcement concerning the resumption of Proletary abroad was
issued as a separate leaflet, stating that the publication had been
transferred from Russia to Geneva and giving publication dates, the names
of contributors and subscription rates.





[4]
Gorky’s Notes on Philistinism were published in the legal
Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn in October–November 1905.





[5]
Berner Tagwacht—daily, organ of the Swiss Social-Democratic
Party, founded in Berne in 1893. At the beginning of World War I the paper
published articles by Karl Liebknecht, Franz Mehring and other Left
Social-Democrats. From 1917 the paper openly supported the
social-chauvinists.

February 7, 1908


Dear A. M.,


I shall consult A. A. about your statement; since you did not know him
personally I think it is not worth while publishing
it.[1]


To what Bolshevik symposium have you sent the article on cynicism? I am puzzled,
because people write to me a good deal about Bolshevik symposia, but I have
never heard of this one. I hope it is to the St. Petersburg
one.[2]
Send me a copy of your letter to Sienkiewicz, if you have one (indicating
when it was sent)—but Sienkiewicz will no doubt publish
it since it is an opinion
poll.[3]


Your plans are very interesting and I should like to come. But, you will agree,
I cannot very well throw up the Party job, which needs organising
immediately.[4] It is difficult to get a new job going. I can’t
throw it up. We shall have it going in about a couple of months or so, and then
I shall be free to tear myself away for a week or two.


I agree with you a thousand times about the need for systematically
combating political decadence, renegadism, whining, and so forth. I do not think
that there would be any disagreement between us about “society” and
the “youth”. The significance of the intellectuals in our Party is
declining; news comes from all sides that the intelligentsia is
fleeing the Party. And a good riddance to these scoundrels. The Party
is purging itself from petty-bourgeois dross. The workers are having a bigger
say in things. The role of the worker-professionals is increasing. All this is
wonderful, and I am sure that your “kicks” must be under stood in
the same sense.

 

Now—how are we to exert influence, what exactly should our literature be?
Symposia or Proletary? Of course, the easier thing is to reply: not
or, but and—the reply will be irreproachable but of
little practical value. We must have legal symposia, of course; our comrades in
St. Petersburg are working on them by the sweat of the brow, and I, too, have
been working on them after London, while sitting in
Kwakalla.[5] If
possible, all efforts should be made to support them and continue
these symposia.[6]


But my experience from London up to November 1907 (half a year!) has convinced
me that no systematic legal literature can now be produced. I am
convinced that what the Party now needs is a regular political organ,
consistently and vigorously pursuing a policy of struggle against
disintegration and despondency—a Party organ, a political
newspaper. Many people in Russia do not believe in a foreign-based organ. But
this is an error, and our collegium knew what it was doing when it decided to
transfer Proletary here. That it is difficult to organise, set it up
and run it—goes without saying. But it has to be done and it will
be done.


Why shouldn’t literary criticism be included in it? Too little space? I
don’t know, of course, your system of working. Unfortunately, when we
have met, we spent more time chattering than talking business. If you
don’t like writing small, short, periodical (weekly or fortnightly)
articles, if you prefer to work on big things—then, of course, I
would not advise you to interrupt it. It will be of greater benefit!


If, however, you are inclined towards joint work in a political
newspaper—why not continue and make a regular feature of the genre which
you began with “Notes on Philistinism” in Novaya Zhizn,
and began very well, in my opinion? I wrote to you about this “with an
ulterior motive” in one of the first letters, thinking: if it appeals to
him, he will seize on the idea. And it seems to me that in your last letter you
are seizing on it after a fashion. Or am I mistaken? How great would be the
gain, both- for Party work through the newspaper, which would not be so
one-sided as it previously was, and for literary work, which would be more
closely linked with Party work,

    

with systematic, continuous influence on the Party! There should be not
“forays”, but a solid onslaught all along the line, without stops or
gaps; Bolshevik Social-Democrats should not only attack all kinds of duffers
piecemeal, but should conquer all and everything as the Japanese conquered
Manchuria from the Russians.


Of the three subjects that you mention for the symposia (philosophy, literary
criticism, and current tactics) one- and-a-half would go into the political
newspaper, into Proletary, viz.: current tactics and a good half of
the literary criticism. Ah, there is nothing good about all those special, long
articles of literary criticism scattered through various semi-Party and
non-Party periodicals! We should try to take a step away from this old,
intellectualist, stuff ed shirt manner, that is, we should link literary
criticism, too, more closely with Party work, with Party
leadership. That is what the adult Social-Democratic Parties in Europe are
doing. That is what we should do, too, without being afraid of the difficulties
of the first steps of collective news paper activity in this field.


Large works of literary criticism—in books, partially in periodicals.


Systematic, periodic articles, in the concert of a political newspaper, linked
with Party work, in the spirit, of what was begun by Novaya
Zhizn—tell me, have you any inclination towards this, or not?


The third subject is philosophy. I am fully aware of my unpreparedness in this
sphere, which prevents me from speaking about it in public. But, as a
rank-and-file Marxist, I read attentively our Party philosophers, I read
attentively the empirio-monist Bogdanov and the empirio-critics Bazarov,
Lunacharsky, etc.—and they drive me to give all my sympathy
to Plekhanov! It takes physical strength to keep oneself from being
carried away by the mood, as Plekhanov does! His tactics are the height of
ineptitude, and baseness. In philosophy, however, he upholds the right cause. I
am for materialism against “empirio-” etc.


Can, and should, philosophy be linked with the trend of Party work? With
Bolshevism? I think this should not be done at the present time. Let our Party
philosophers put in some more work on theory for a while, let them dis-

    

pute and ... seek a meeting of minds. For the time being, I would stand
for such philosophical disputes as those between materialists and
“empirios” being separated from integral Party work.


I look forward to your reply, meanwhile I must conclude.


Yours,
Lenin


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to Gorky’s statement for the press in connection with the
arrest of Semashko.





[2]
The article “On Cynicism” was written by Gorky for the French magazine
Les Documents du Progrès and was first published in the
symposium Literaturny Raspad (Zerno Publishers, St. Petersburg,
which appeared in 1908) and afterwards in the March issue of the French
magazine. The article contained erroneous ideas of a god-building nature.





[3]
Gorky’s letter of January 30, 1908, to Henryk Sienkiewicz was an answer to
the opinion poll organised by the latter on the attitude to the seizure of
the Poznan landowners’ estates by the Prussian government.


Gorky’s letter was an accusatory document directed against Sienkiewicz’s
defence of big private landownership in Poznan. Gorky wrote to Sienkiewicz
that, while he appreciated his gift as an artist, he protested against
Sienkiewicz appealing to Wilhelm II with such arguments as the “peaceful”
behaviour of the Poles, who were “not kindling in the fire of
revolution”, were punctually paying their taxes and providing soldiers for
the Prussian army. “These words give me reason to doubt the strength of
your love for the Polish people,” Gorky wrote in conclusion.


The 252 replies to Sienkiewicz’s questionnaire were published by him in
book form in Paris, but Gorky’s reply was left out.





[4]
Lenin was engaged in the work of issuing the newspaper
Proletary, publication of which had been transferred from
Finland to Geneva at the end of 1907.





[5]
Kwakalla—a jocular name for the village Kuokkala, in
Finland, where Lenin lived during May–November 1907.





[6]
The Bolshevik symposia were published after the coup of June 3rd when the
legal newspapers and periodicals were obliged to close down owing to
censorship persecution. The year 1907 and beginning of 1908 saw the
publication of the symposia Golos Zhizni (The Voice of Life),
Zarnitsy (Summer Lightning), Kalendar dlya vsekh (Popular
Calendar) for 1908, Tyemi Dnya (Topics of the Day),
Tekushchaya Zhizn (Current Life), O Veyaniakh Vremeni
(Spirit of the Times).

February 13, 1908


Dear An. Vas.,


Yesterday I sent you a short note about Bringmann.
I hasten to reply to your letter of February 11.


I don’t quite understand why you should feel hurt by
my letter. Not on account of philosophy, surely!


Your plan for a section of belles-lettres in Proletary and
for having A. M. run it is an excellent one, and pleases me exceedingly. I have
in fact been dreaming of making the literature and criticism section a
permanent feature in Proletary and having A. M. to run it. But I was
afraid, terribly afraid of making the proposal outright, as I do
not know the nature of A. M.’s work (and his work-bent). If a man is busy
with an important work, and if this work would suffer from him being torn away
for minor things, such as a newspaper, and journalism, then it would be foolish
and criminal to disturb and interrupt him! That is something I very well
understand and feel.


Being on the spot, you will know best, dear An. Vas.
If you consider that A. M.’s work will not suffer by his being
harnessed to regular Party work (and the Party work will
gain a great deal from this!), then try to arrange it.


Proletary No. 21 will come out on February 13(26). So
there is still time. It is desirable to have the manuscripts
by Friday, which will give us plenty of time to put them in the issue
which comes out on Wednesday. If it’s some thing urgent we could manage it even
if the copy arrives on Sunday (to avoid delay, write and send it directly to my
address), or even (in an extreme case!) on Monday.

 

You, too, must write without fail. Won’t you send us for No. 21 either a
political article on Russian affairs (10,000-16,000 characters) or an article on
Fern’s
resignation[1] (8,000-10,000 characters)? Better still,
not “either...or”, but “both...and”.


I send you my best regards and ask you to reply whether
A. M.’s contribution to Protetary is being arranged. If it
is, let him begin at once, without waiting for the “meeting”
and an
agreement.[2]


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the refusal of E. Ferri, leader of the centrist majority of
the Italian Socialist Party, to edit the Party’s Central Organ
Avanti!. Lunacharsky’s article “The Crisis in the Italian Workers
Party” was published in Proletary No. 23, for March 11 (February 27), 1908.





[2]
The reference is to a meeting on Capri, sponsored by Gorky, which was
to have been attended by Lenin, Bogdanov, Bazarov, Lunacharsky and
Skvortsov-Stepanov to discuss questions of publishing activities and
theoretical questions. The meeting took place in April 1908
(Skvortsov-Stepanov did not attend; he came to Geneva for a week to
meet Lenin). Lenin mentions it in his “A Letter to Students at the
Capri Party School” dated August 30, 1909^^(see Vol. 15 of this
edition)^^.

I think that some of the questions you raise about our
differences of opinion are a sheer misunderstanding. Never,
of course, have I thought of “chasing away the intelligentsia”, as the silly syndicalists do, or of denying its necessity for the workers’ movement. There can be no divergence
between us on any of these questions; of that I am quite
sure, and since we cannot get together at the moment, we
must start work together at once. At work we shall best
of all find a common language.


I am very, very pleased with your plan of writing short
paragraphs for Proletary (the announcement has been sent
to you). Naturally, if you are working on something big,
do not break it off.


Regarding Trotsky, I wanted to reply last time, but I
forgot. We (i.e., the editorial board of Proletary, Al. Al.,
myself and “Inok”—a very good colleague from the home
Bolsheviks) decided straight away to invite him on to
Proletary. We wrote him a letter, proposing and outlining
a theme. By general agreement we signed it the “Editorial
Board of Proletary”, so as to put the matter on a more
collegial footing (I personally, for example, had had a
big fight with Trotsky, a regular fierce battle in 1903-05
when he was a Menshevik). Whether there was something
in the form of our letter that offended Trotsky, I do not
know, but he sent us a letter, not written by him: “On
Comrade Trotsky’s instructions” the editorial board of Proletary was informed that he refused to write, he was too.
busy.

 

In my opinion, this is mere posturing. At the London
Congress,[1] too, he acted
the poseur. I don’t know really whether he will
go with the Bolsheviks....


The Mensheviks here have issued an announcement about the monthly Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata[2] over the signatures of Plekhanov, Axelrod,
Dan, Martov and Martynov. I shall get it and send it to you. The struggle may
become sharper. But Trotsky wants to stand “above the contending factions”....


It is in regard to materialism as a world outlook that I think I disagree with
you in substance. Not the “materialist conception of history” (our
“empirios”[3] do not deny that), but philosophical
materialism. That the Anglo-Saxons and Germans owed their philistinism to
“materialism”, and the Romance peoples their anarchism, is something
I emphatic ally dispute. Materialism, as a philosophy, was everywhere pushed
into the background by them. Neue Zeit, that most sober and
well-informed organ, is indifferent to philosophy, was never a zealous supporter
of philosophical materialism, and of late has been publishing the
empirio-critics without a single reservation. It is wrong, absolutely wrong to
think that dead philistinism could be deduced from the materialism which Marx
and Engels taught! All the philistine trends in Social-Democracy are most of
all at war with philosophical materialism, they lean towards Kant,
neo-Kantianism, the critical philosophy. No, the philosophy which Engels
substantiated in Anti-Dühring keeps philistinism at arm’s
length. Plekhanov does harm to this philosophy by linking the struggle
here with the factional struggle, but after all no Russian
Social-Democrat ought to confuse the present Plekhanov with the old Plekhanov.


Al. Al. has just now left me. I shall communicate with him again about the
“meeting”. If you insist—it could be arranged for a couple of
days and very soon at that.


All the best.
Lenin


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Fifth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in London on
April 30–May 19 (May 13–June 1), 1907. It was attended by 336
delegates, of whom 105 were Bolsheviks, 97 Mensheviks, 57 Bundists, 44
Polish Social-Democrats, 29 Lettish Social-Democrats and 4
non-factionalists. The Poles and Letts supported the Bolsheviks, who
had a solid majority at the Congress. One of the main questions
discussed was that of the attitude to the bourgeois parties. Lenin
delivered the report on this question. On all fundamental issues the
Congress adopted Bolshevik resolutions. A Central Committee was
elected consisting of 5 Bolsheviks, 4 Mensheviks, 2 Polish and 1
Lettish Social-Democrats. Among the alternate members elected to the
C.C. were 10 Bolsheviks, 7 Mensheviks, 3 Polish and 2 Lettish
Social-Democrats.


The Fifth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. marked the victory of Bolshevism
in the Russian working-class movement. The decisions of the Congress
summed up the struggle of the Bolsheviks against the opportunist,
Menshevik wing of the Party in the period of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution. The Bolsheviks’ tactics were approved by the Congress and
accepted as the tactics of the whole Party.





[2]
Golos Sotsial-Democrata (Voice of a Social-Democrat)—a
newspaper, the organ of the Mensheviks, published from February 1908
to December 1911, first in Geneva, thon in Paris. The newspaper coming
out in open support of the liquidators, Plekhanov resigned from the
editorial board in May 1909, after which the paper took definite shape
as the ideological centre of the liquidators.





[3]
Lenin is referring to the group of empirio-critics and
empirio-monists, adherents of the reactionary idealist philosophy of
Mach and Avenarius, namely, Bogdanov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky.

Dear A. M.,


It’s a pity I can’t manage to go and see you. A reply has come from
Brussels[1] and here there is no delay. But there is no money and no
time, and I cannot abandon the newspaper.


Judging from the fact that you own a nanny-goat, I see that you are in a good
humour, the right frame of mind, and life is normal with you. With us things are
going none too well. We are pretty much at loggerheads with Al. Al. over this
philosophy. I am neglecting the newspaper because of my hard bout of philosophy:
one day I read one of the empirio-critics and swear like a fishwife, next day I
read another and swear still worse. And Innokenty scolds me—and quite
right too—for neglecting Proletary. Things are not running
smoothly.


Ah, well, it’s only natural. Things will come right.


It would be fine if you could manage to write for Proletary without
your major works suffering.


With warm greetings and best regards to A. Vas. and Maria Fyodorovna.


Yours,
Lenin

March 24, 1908


Dear A. M.,


I have received your letter concerning my fight with the Machists. I quite
understand and respect your feelings and I ought to say that I get something
similar from my St. Petersburg friends, but I am very deeply convinced that you
are mistaken.


You must understand—and you will, of course—that once a Party man
has become convinced that a certain doctrine is grossly fallacious and
harmful, he is obliged to come out against it. I would not be kicking
up a row if I were not absolutely convinced (and I am becoming more and more
convinced of this every day as I study the original sources of wisdom of
Bazarov, Bogdanov and Co.) that their book is ridiculous, harmful, philistine,
fideist—the whole of it, from beginning to end, from branch to root, to
Mach and Avenarius. Plekhanov, at bottom, is entirely right in being
against them, only he is unable or unwilling or too lazy to say so
concretely, in detail, simply, without unnecessarily frightening his
readers with philosophical nuances. And at all costs I shall say it in my
own way.


What kind of “reconciliation” can there be here, dear A. M.? Why, it
is ludicrous even to mention it. A fight is absolutely inevitable. And
Party people should devote their efforts not to slurring it over, putting it off
or dodging it, but to ensuring that essential Party work does not
suffer in practice. That is what you should be concerned about,
and nine-tenths of the Bolsheviks in Russia will help you in this and heartily
thank you for it.

 

How is this to be done? By “neutrality”? No. There cannot and will not
be any neutrality on such an issue. If it is possible to speak of
neutrality, it can only be in a relative sense: we must
separate all this fight from the faction. So far, you have been writing
“from the outside”, keeping away from the factional publications; go on
writing in this way. Only so will the faction not be committed, not be
involved, not be compelled tomorrow or the day after to
decide, to vote, i.e., to turn the fight into a
chronic, protracted, hopeless affair.


That is why I am against
allowing any kind of philosophy in
the
journal.[2] I know I am being abused for this: he wants to stop other
people’s mouths, while he has not yet opened his own! But just think it
over coolly.


A journal with philosophy. No. 1—three articles of Bazarov, Bogdanov and
Lunacharsky against Plekhanov. One article of mine saying that Studies in
the Philosophy of Marxism=Berdayevism and reactionary clericalism.


No. 2—three times three keyed up articles of Bogdanov, Bazarov and
Lunacharsky against Plekhanov and Lenin. One article of mine, proving from
another angle that Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism=reactionary
clericalism.


No. 3—howling and cursing.


I could write six or a dozen articles against Studies in the Philosophy of
Marxism, one article against each author and each aspect of his views. Can
this drag on in this way? flow long? Will this not make a split
inevitable through endless exacerbation and embitterment? Will
this not bind the faction to make a decision: decide, analyse, and end
the “discussion” by a vote....


Think this over carefully, if you fear a split. Will the practical workers
undertake to distribute books with such a “fight”? Isn’t another way
better: go on writing as before, outside the factional
publications. Do your scrapping on the side, for the time being the
faction can wait. If there is a chance of weakening the inevitable
animosity, it can only be in this way, I think.


You write: the Mensheviks will gain from a fight. You are mistaken, deeply
mistaken, A. M.! They will gain if the Bolshevik faction does not dissociate
itself from. the philosophy of the three Bolsheviks. In that case,
they will

    

definitely win. But if the philosophical fight goes on out side the faction, the
Mensheviks will be definitely reduced to a political line and that will be the
death of them.


I say: separate the fight from the faction. Of course, such a
separation, on living persons, is rather difficult and painful. It needs
time. It needs solicitous comrades. Here the practical workers will help, here
you should help, here it is a question of “psychology”, and you know
best. I think you could help a lot here—provided that, on reading my book
against the Studies,
[1]

you don’t become as furious against me as I
became against them.


As regards the journal, think it over carefully and answer me soon. I am a
little doubtful whether it is worth while for us to make the journey to you
together at present. Why jangle nerves unnecessarily? Why draw out the
torture
there is no avoiding a fight. Would it not be better to settle this business of
the journal simply, without long negotiations and ceremonial and futile
meetings. I am merely putting questions to you in order to consult you.


Best regards to M. F. I shall most certainly come to Capri and try to bring my
wife along, only I should like to do this independently of the philosophical
fight.


All the very best.

Yours,
Lenin


P.S. I enclose important information about a spy among
you.

How is it there is no news from you, dear A. M.? You wrote that you had long
finished your big work and were going to help us in Proletary. But
when? What about your doing a small article on Tolstoy or something of that
sort? Send us a line whether you intend to do
so.[1]


Al. Al. is on his way to you. I can neither abandon the paper nor get away from
my work. But this is only a delay, I shall come all the same.


What do you think of Proletary? It is an uncared-for
waif. Never before have I so neglected my paper: I spend whole days
reading the accursed Machists, and dash off articles for the newspaper in
incredible haste.


Well, all the best.

Yours,
Lenin


To M. F. thousand greetings! I shall bicycle down to see her!


Get Anat. Vas. to write for Proletary too! Let me do some
philosophic barking by helping Proletary in the meantime!


 
Notes

Gorky’s article on Tolstoy did not appear in Proletary. Asked
in 1927 whether he had written such an article, Gorky answered. “I
wrote something about Tolstoy for Proletary. I don’t remember
what the title was. Possibly, ’A Great Man’.”

Dear A. V.,


I have received your letter. I am very glad that you are undertaking
work for Proletary. This is absolutely necessary,
particularly in regard to the subjects you mention+Italian letters. Mind
you don’t forget that you are a contributor to a Party newspaper and
don’t let those round you forget it.


All the very best.

Yours,
Lenin


P. S. Privately, about philosophy: I cannot return your compliments and
I think you will soon take yours back. As for me, I have parted company (and
probably for a long time) with the preachers of “the union of scientific
socialism and religion” and with all Machists as well.

April 16, 1908


Dear Al. M.,


Today I received your letter and hasten to reply. It is useless and harmful for
me to come: I cannot and will not talk to people who are preaching the
union of scientific socialism and religion. The time for
notebooks[1]
is past. It’s no use arguing, and it’s stupid to jangle one’s nerves
for nothing. Philosophy must be separated from Party (factional)
affairs: the decision of the Bolshevik Centre
[2] makes this
obligatory.


I have already sent to be printed the most formal declaration of
war.[3] There is no longer any room for diplomacy here—of
course, I am speaking of diplomacy not in the bad sense, but in the good sense
of the word.


“Good” diplomacy on your part, dear A. M. (if you, too, have not come
to believe in God), should consist in separating our joint (i.e., including
myself) affairs from philosophy.


A talk on other matter than philosophy won’t come off now: it would be
unnatural. Incidentally, if these other matters, not
philosophical, but Proletary matters, for example, really demand
talks just now, and at your place, I could come (I don’t know
whether I shall find the money:
there are difficulties at present), but I repeat: only on condition that I do
not speak about philosophy or religion.


And I definitely intend coming to have a talk with you when I am free and
through with my work.


All the very best.

Yours,
Lenin


Best regards to M. F.: she is not for God, by any chance, is she?

April 19, 1908


Dear A. M.,


I have received the telegram from you and M. F. and am sending my refusal today
or tomorrow morning. I repeat, on no account is it permissible to mix
the disputes of writers about philosophy with a Party (i.e.,
factional) matter. I have already written about this to
An.
Vas.[1] and to avoid any misinterpretations or incorrect conclusions from my refusal to come I repeat it for all the comrades. We
should continue to conduct our factional work harmoniously: none of us has
regretted the policy which we pursued and implemented at the time of the
revolution. Hence, it is our duty to defend it before the Party. We can
only do this all together, and we should do it in Proletary and in all
Party work.


If, in the course of it, A should inveigh against B, or B inveigh against A, on
account of philosophy, we must do this as a thing apart, that is,
without interfering with the work.


I shouldn’t like you and the comrades to put a bad construction on my
refusal to come. I am very sorry, but the whole situation and the state of the
editorial board prevent my coming.


All the very best.

Yours, Lenin


We are expecting to receive the promised article about the Rome strike from
An. Vas. as soon as possible. We are expecting help for Proletary from
all writers: we are all answerable to our comrades in Russia, who are dissatisfied with it. Let Al. Al. concern himself seriously about money! They
are crying out in Russia for lack of money.

Dear friend,


Thanks for your letter. Both your “suspicions” are wrong. I was not
suffering from nerves, but our position is difficult. A split with Bogdanov is
imminent. The true cause is offence at the sharp criticism of his philosophical
views at lectures (not at all in the newspaper). Now Bogdanov is hunting out
every kind of difference of opinion. Together with Alexinsky, who is kicking up
a terrible row and with whom I have been compelled to break off all relations,
he has dragged the boycott out into the light of day.


They are trying to bring about a split on empirio-monistic and boycott
grounds. The storm will burst very soon. A fight at the coming conference is
inevitable. A split is highly probable. I shall leave the faction as soon as the
policy of the “Left” and of true “boycottism” gets the
up per hand. I invited you, thinking that your speedy arrival would help to
pacify. In August (new style) we are nevertheless counting on you without fail
as a participant in the conference. Be sure to arrange things so as to be able
to travel abroad. We shall send money for the journey to all the
Bolsheviks. Issue the slogan locally: mandates to be given only to local, and
only to active Party workers. We earnestly request you to write for our
newspaper. We can now pay for articles and will pay regularly.


All the best.


Do you know of any publisher who would handle the work on philosophy I am
writing?[2]

May 18, 1909


Werte Genossin,


I sent you yesterday by registered book-post a copy of my book on
philosophy—in memory of our conversation about Mach when we last
met.[3]


If possible, I should like to ask you to write a note about this book for
Neue Zeit[4] for the “Verzeichnis der in der Redaktion eingelaufenen Druck-Schriften”=

[1]

. If this necessitates any
formality, such as sending the book direct to the editors (who do not understand
Russian), please drop me a line about it and I shall try to send a special copy
to the editors of Neue Zeit,


You, of course, have heard from Comrade Tyszka about our internal struggle among
the Bolsheviks. Your article against the otzovists and
ultimatumists[5]
has pleased everyone very
much[6]; it is a pity that you write
so rarely in Russian; you prefer the rich Social-Democratic Party of
the Germans to the poor Social-Democratic Party of the Russians.


All the best! Regards to Tyszka. With greetings.

N. Lenin


P.S. The note of Die Neue Zeit editors to Rothstein’s (excellent)
article in No. 33 leads me to think that Kautsky himself is none too
pleased now with his defence of the I.L.P. in
Brussels[7].... Am I right?



 
Notes
 

[1]

“List of printed matter received by the editorial board.”—Ed.

 



[2]
Luxemburg, Rosa (1871–1919)—a prominent member of the
international labour movement, one of the leaders of the Left wing of
the Second International. Started revolutionary activities in the late
eighties, was one of the founders and leaders of the Social-Democratic
Party of Poland. From 1897 took an active part in the German
Social-Democratic movement.


After the revolution of November 1918 in Germany took a leading part
in the Inaugural Congress of the Communist Party of Germany.  In
January 1919 she was arrested and killed by order of the Scheidemann
government.





[3]
Lenin and Krupskaya visited Rosa Luxemburg early in January 1908 when
they stopped over in Berlin on their way to Geneva from Stockholm.





[4]
The notice (note) concerning the appearance of Lenin’s. book
Materialism and Empirio-Criticism was published in the
journal Die Neue Zeit, 1. Band, No. 2, October 8, 1909.





[5]
Otzovists (from the Russian word
otzovat—recall)—the name given to some of the Bolsheviks
(Bogdanov, Pokrovsky, Lunacharsky, Bubnov and others) who demanded
that the Social-Democratic deputies in the Third Duma should be
recalled and that work in the legal organisations should be
stopped. In 1908 the otzovists formed a group of their own and waged a
struggle against Lenin. They emphatically refused to sit in the Duma
or work in the trade unions, co-operative societies and other mass
legal and semi-legal organisations of the workers. They strove to shut
themselves up within the framework of the illegal organisation: to
tear the Party away from the non-party masses and expose it to the
attacks of reaction. Lenin called the otzovists “liquidators of a new
type” and “Mensheviks inside out”.


A variety of otzovism was ultimatumism. The ultimatumists differed
from the otzovists only in form. They proposed that an ultimatum
should first be presented to the Social-Democratic group in the Duma
and if it was not complied with, the Social-Democratic deputies should
be recalled from the Duma.



Ultimatumism was virtually otzovism in disguise. Lenin called the
ultimatumists “bashful otzovists”.


In the spring of 1909 the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders
formed a promotion group to organise an anti-Party school on the Isle
of Capri (Bogdanov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky and others). This group, in
effect, was the centre of the anti-Party faction of otzovists,
ultimatumists, and god-builders.


A meeting of the extended editorial board of Proletary held
in June 1909 adopted a decision that “Bolshevism, as a definite
tendency in the R.S.D.L.P. has nothing in common with otzovism or
ultimatumism” and called upon the Bolsheviks to resolutely combat
this defection from revolutionary Marxism. Bogdanov (Maximov), the
guiding spirit of otzovism, was expelled from the ranks of the
Bolsheviks.


Later, in his book “Left-Wing” Communism—an Infantile
Disorder, Lenin wrote that the Bolsheviks were able to make an
orderly retreat and preserve their forces after the failure of the
revolution because “they ruthlessly exposed and expelled the
revolutionary phrase-mongers, those who did not wish to understand
that one had to retreat, that one had to know how to retreat, and that
one had absolutely to learn how to work legally in the most
reactionary of parliaments, in the most reactionary of trade unions,
co-operative and insurance societies and similar organisations”^^(see
Vol. 31, p. 28, of this edition)^^.





[6]
The article referred to was “Revolutionary Hangover” published in
Proletary No. 44, April 8 (21), 1909.




[7]
The reference is to Kautsky’s stand at the meeting of the
International Socialist Bureau on October 11, 1908 on the question of
the British Labour Party’s membership of the Second
International. This is dealt within Lenin’s article “Meeting of the International Socialist Bureau”^^(see Vol. 15 of this edition)^^.

Dear Mark,


I am sending you for Lyova my reply to the
Capriotes.[2] If he
considers it necessary, let him make a copy for Inok, and then send the letter
to Capri—I don’t know the address. I think it could be sent in two
envelopes: the outer one inscribed “Signor Massimo Gorki, Villa
Blaesus, Capri, Italie”, and the inner one: “For the Executive
Committee of the School”.


I don’t know any other address.


As regards Trotsky, I must say that I shall be most vigorously opposed to
helping him if he rejects (and he has already rejected it!)
equality on the editorial board, proposed to him by a member of the
C.C. Without a settlement of this question by the Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Centre, no steps to help Trotsky are
permissible. Consequently, the Economic Committee is entitled to agree
to the printing of
Pravda[3] at the Proletary
printing-press only if this will not be help for a new faction (for
Trotsky is founding a new faction, whereas the Bolshevik C.C. member proposed to
him instead that he should come into the Party) but a strictly
commercial deal, for payment, as with any other person, provided the compositors
are disengaged, etc. I insist most categorically that the question of the
attitude to Pravda shall still be decided by the Executive
Committee of the Bolshevik Centre and that pending this decision not a
single step in the way of help shall be taken, nor shall we bind
ourselves in any way.


All the best.
N. Lenin


P.S. Please make a copy of my letter to the Capriotes in any case. It
may prove necessary for the B.C.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lyubimov, A. I. (1879–1919)—a Social-Democrat, joined the
revolutionary movement in 1898. Repeatedly persecuted by the tsarist
government. In 1904 was co-opted on to the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. Delegate of the Party’s Council to the Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. Adopted a conciliatory stand towards the Mensheviks
both after the Second Congress of the Party and during the years of
reaction.





[2]

^^See Lenin’s “A Letter to the Organisers of the Party School on
Capri” (Vol. 15 of this edition).^^


The Capri school was organised in 1909 on Capri (Italy) by
the otzovists, ultimatumists and god builders. The meeting of the
extended editorial board of Proletary exposed the factional
anti-Bolshevik nature of the school, which was condemned and qualified
as “a new centre being formed for a faction breaking away from the
Bolsheviks”^^(see Vol. 15, p. 450, of this edition)^^.


The school began to function in August, lectures being read by


   

Bogdanov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky, Gorky, Lyadov, Pokrovsky and
Desnitsky. Lenin declined the organisers’ invitation that he come to Capri
as a lecturer. In his letter to the school’s students, who insisted on his
reading a cycle of lectures to them, Lenin explained that he could not do
it inasmuch as it was “a school deliberately hidden away from the
Party” in “a remote foreign spot” and bearing a factional
character. Lenin proposed to the students that they should come to Paris
where they would learn real Social-Democracy instead of the
“separatist factional ‘science’” of the otzovists and
god-builders (see Vol. 15, pp. 472–78, of this edition).





[3]
This refers to the Mensheviks’ newspaper Pravda, published in
1908–12. The first issues appeared in Lvov, and from No. 4 onward the
paper came out in Vienna.

Dear Gr.,


I have received No. 7–8 of
Sotsial-Demokrat.[2] I
object to Trotsky’s signature; signatures must be
omitted. (I have not yet read the articles.)


As regards Proletary, I think we should insert in it 1) am article on
the elections In St. Petersburg (in connection with the claptrap of
Rech[3] and Vodovozov, if Rech has not misreported
him); 2) on the Swedish strike—a summing-up article is essential; 3)
ditto on the Spanish
events[4];
4) on the Mensheviks, in connection with their (very vile) polemic with the
Geneva
(Georgien[5]) anti-liquidator; 5) in the supplement as a
special sheet, an answer to the “Open Letter” of Maximov and
Co.[6] A proper answer must be given to them so that these scoundrels
do not mislead people by their lies.


After three weeks’ holiday, I am beginning to comb round. I think I could take
No. 4 and 5, upon myself, if need be No. 1 as well, but I am still afraid to
promise. Write me your opinion and the exact deadlines. What else is
there for Proletary?


No. 2 and 3 can be made up from Vorwärts; I shall send it to you, if
you will undertake to write.


As regards Pravda, have you read Trotsky’s letter to Inok? If you
have, I hope it has convinced you that Trotsky behaves like a despicable
careerist and factionalist of the Ryazanov-and-Co. type? Either
equality on the editorial board, subordination to the C.C. and no
one’s transfer to Paris except Trotsky’s (the scoundrel, he wants to
“fix up” the whole rascally crew of Pravda at our
expense!)—

    

or a break with this swindler and an exposure of him in the C.O. He pays lip-service to the Party and behaves worse than any other of the factionalists.


All the best.


N. Lenin


P.S. I’m afraid we’ll have to give Kamenev up as a bad job. An article on
The Social
Movement[7]has been promised six weeks (or
six months) ago?


My address is: Mr. Wl. Oulianoff (Chez Madame Lecreux), Bombon
(Seine-et-Marne).


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Zinoviev, Grigory Yevseyevich (1883–1936)—joined the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1901. From 1908 to April 1917 was an emigrant abroad, member
of the editorial board of the Party’s Central Organ
Sotsial-Democrat and of the Bolshevik newspaper
Proletary. During the years of reaction (1907–10) and the new
revolutionary upsurge he adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the
liquidators, otzovists and Trotskyists. In the period of preparation and
conduct of the October Revolution he wavered and was opposed to an armed
uprising.


In November 1927 he was expelled from the Party for factional activities,
was twice reinstated and expelled again for anti-Party activities.





[2]
Sotsial-Demokrat—Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., an illegal
newspaper published from February 1908 to January 1917. The editorial
board, by decision of the C.C. elected at the Fifth (London) Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P., was composed of representatives of the Bolsheviks,
Mensheviks and Polish Social-Democrats. The paper was virtually run by
Lenin.





[3]
Rech (Speech)—a daily newspaper, Central Organ of the Cadet
Party, published in St. Petersburg from February 1906. Closed down by the
Military Revolutionary Committee on October 26 (November 8), 1917.





[4]
The reference is to the general strike in Sweden, which broke out on
August 4, 1909, following the lockout of 83,000 workers in various branches
of industry, and to the revolt in Catalonia. Articles on these subjects
were published in Proletary No. 47–48 under the headings:
“Lessons of the Class Struggle (the General Strike in Sweden)”, a leading
article and “Colonial Robbery and Revolution”.





[5]
The polemic Lenin intended writing about was carried on in June and
August–September 1909 in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, Nos. 15

   

and 16–17, in connection with an article by a Geneva anti-liquidator
Menshevik, apparently Victor Tevzaya (Georgien), entitled “A Word on a
Topical Subject”, in which he defended the idea of an illegal party and
urged that the Menshevik organisations clear their ranks of the liquidator
legalists. In leading articles headed “Concerning the Article of a Geneva
Comrade” and “On the Organisational Discussion” the Golos
people denied that they “winked at” liquidationism and accused the author
of sectarianism. In his reply (“On the Same Subject”) Georgien quoted a
number of documents reflecting the activities of the liquidators in the
organisations in Russia. No special article on this polemic appeared in
Proletary. Reference to a promised analysis and evaluation of
liquidator ideas “piled up” in issue No. 15 of Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata is contained in a footnote to Lenin’s article “The
Liquidation of Liquidationism”^^(see Vol. 15, p. 460, of this edition)^^.





[6]
This refers to the contents of the current issue, No. 47–48, of
Proletary, which published the following articles by Lenin: “The
Liquidators Exposed”, “On the Open Letter of the Executive Committee of
the Moscow Regional Committee”, and “The Elections in St. Petersburg”,
and to the supplement to this issue containing the article “The Faction of
Supporters of Otzovism and God-Building”^^(see Vol. 16 of this edition)^^.





[7]

L. B. Kamenev’s article on the Menshevik five-volume publication The
Social Movement in Russia at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century
edited by L. Martov, P. Maslov and A. Potresov, was published in
Proletary, Nos. 47–48 and 49, September 5 (18) and October 3
(16), 1909.

Dear Mark,


I entirely agree, of course, to your making free use of my letter for a report
or for publication.
[1]

Bear in mind, though, that I am writing an article
[2]

for
Proletary in which I bluntly describe the gang of scoundrels, Maximov
and Co., as canaille, and call their school nothing but a “Yerogin’s
hostel”.
[3]

And so, to avoid misunderstanding I agree to speak
“mildly” only to workers who address me personally
over their own signatures.


Maximov and Co., however, are a band of adventurers who have enticed some
workers into their Yerogin hostel. To avoid contradictions, do not
circulate my letter among our people, but send it exclusively to
organisations with this reservation (the reservation had better be
published too):


“The appropriate reply to the company of offended writers, unrecognised
philosophers and ridiculed
god-builders[4] who have hidden away
their so-called “school” from the Party, will be given in
Proletary. The present letter, however, is Lenin’s personal
reply to those workers who have addressed him personally.”


I should advise everyone either not to go to Bogdanov’s
lecture—or to answer him in such a way as once and for all to kill the
desire to butt in. It is base cowardice to go

    

gate-crashing on a faction from which he has already been ejected. There is
nothing more harmful now than sentimentalising. A complete break and
war, more determined than that against the Mensheviks. This war will
quickly teach the fools who have still “not made things out”.


All the best.

God-builders—adherents of a religious-philosophical trend,
hostile to Marxism, which in the period of reaction (1907–10) arose among
a section of the Party intellectuals who had moved away from Marxism after
the defeat of the revolution of 1905–07. The god-builders advocated the
creation of a new “socialist” religion and tried to reconcile Marxism
with religion. An extended meeting of the editorial board of
Proletary held on June 8–17 (21–30), 1909 condemned god-building
and declared in a special resolution that the Bolshevik section of the
Party had nothing in common with “such a distortion of scientific
socialism”. (See the C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its
Congresses, Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee, Part 1,
1954, p. 222.)


The reactionary nature of god-building was exposed by Lenin in his book
Materialism and Empirio-criticism^^(see Vol. 14 of this
edition)^^.

November 16, 1909


Dear Alexei Maximovich,


I have been fully convinced all the time that you and Comrade Mikhail were the
most hardened factionalists of the new faction, with whom it would be silly of
me to try and talk in a friendly way. Today for the first time I met Comrade
Mikhail, and had a heart-to-heart chat with him both about affairs and about
you, and I perceived that I had been cruelly mistaken. Believe me, the
philosopher Hegel was right: life proceeds by contradictions, and living
contradictions are so much richer, more varied and deeper in content than they
may seem at first sight to a man’s mind. I regarded the school as
merely the centre of a new faction. This has turned out to be
wrong—not in the sense that it was not the centre of a new faction (the
school was this centre and is so at the present time), but in the sense that
this was incomplete, not the whole truth. Subjectively, certain people made such
a centre out of the school, objectively, it was such, but in addition the
school drew to it real front-rank workers from real working-class life. What happened was that, besides the contradiction between the old and the new faction, a
contradiction developed on Capri, between some of the Social-Democratic
intellectuals and the workers from Russia, who will bring Social-Democracy on to
the true path at all costs and whatever happens, and who will do so
despite all the squabbling and dissension abroad, despite the
“incidents”, and so on and so forth. People like Mikhail are a
guarantee of it. Moreover, it turned out that a contradiction developed in the
school between elements of the Capri Social-Democratic intelligentsia.

 

I gathered from Mikhail that you are taking things hard, dear A. M. You have
seen the working class and Social-Democratic movement from an aspect and in
forms and manifestations which already more than once in the history of Russia
and Western Europe have led intellectuals of little faith to despair of the
workers’ movement and Social-Democracy. I am confident that this will not
happen in your case, and after my talk with Mikhail I want to shake your hand
heartily. With your gifts as an artist you have rendered such a tremendous
service to the working-class movement of Russia—and indeed not only of
Russia—and will render a still greater service yet, that it is on no
account permissible for you to fall a prey to moods of depression evoked by
episodes of the struggle abroad. Conditions occur when the course of the
working-class movement inevitably gives rise to this struggle abroad, and to
splits, dissension and the quarrelling among the circles
—but this is not because of the workers’ movement being intrinsically weak
or Social-Democracy intrinsically erroneous, but because the elements out of
which the working class has to forge its Party are too heterogeneous and diverse
in calibre. The working class will forge it in any case, it will forge an
excellent revolutionary Social-Democratic Party in Russia, and it will do so
more speedily than Sometimes seems likely from the standpoint of the
thrice-accursed emigrant position; it will forge it more surely than might be
imagined if one were to judge by some external manifestations and individual
episodes. People like Mikhail are a guarantee of that.


All the very best to you and to Maria Fyodorovna. I am now hopeful that we shall
meet again and not as enemies.


Yours,

Lenin

Dear A. M.,


You are wrong in asking me to come over. Why should I be slanging Maximov,
Lunacharsky, etc.? You yourself write about keeping at loggerheads strictly
among ourselves and yet you invite us to do the same in public. It’s no
model. And about repelling the workers, you are wrong there too. If they accept
our invitation and call on us, we shall have a chat with them and fight for the
views of a certain news
paper,[2] which certain factionalists are
abusing (I heard this long ago from Lyadov and others) as being a deadly bore, a
semi-literate and useless paper which does not believe in the proletariat or
socialism.


As regards a new split, your arguments don’t hang together. On the one
hand, both are nihilists (and “Slav anarchists”—why, my dear man,
the non-Slav Europeans at times like ours fought, cursed and split a hundred
times worse than we do!)—and, on the other hand, the split will be not
less deep than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. If it is a question
of the “nihilism” of the “loggerheads”, of the
semi-literacy, etc., of someone who does not believe in what he writes,
etc.—then, the split is not deep or it is not a split at all. And if the
split is deeper than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks—then it is
not a question of nihilism, not a question of writers who do not believe in what
they write. It doesn’t hold water, really! You are wrong about the present
split and
justly[1]

say: “I understand people but not their deeds.”


What strikes you and Maximov in Proletary as insincerity and futility, etc., is due to a totally different view point on the
entire present moment (and, of course, on Marxism). We have been marking time
for almost two years now, torturing questions which still seem “disput-

    

able” to Maximov, but which events decided long ago. And if we were to
continue “disputing” about them, we would still be vainly marking
time. But by parting company, we shall show  the workers clearly, directly and
definitely, two ways out. The Social-Democratic workers will make their choice
easily and swiftly, for the tactics of preserving (in storage cans) the
revolutionary words of 1905-06 instead of applying the revolutionary
method to a new, different situation, to a changed epoch, which demands different methods and different forms of organisation—these
tactics are dead. The proletariat is moving towards revolution and will come to
it, but not in the way it did prior to 1905. To one who
“believes” that the proletariat will make it, but who does not
understand this “not in the way”–to him our position is
bound to seem insincere, futile, tedious, based on lack of faith in
the proletariat and socialism, etc., etc. The divergence resulting from this is,
undoubtedly, deep enough to make a split—at least
abroad—inevitable. But it does not come anywhere near the split between
the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, if one Is to speak of the depth of the split in
the Party, in Social-Democracy, among Marxists.


You are surprised that I fail to see Mikhail’s hysteria, lack of
discipline (it is not for you to say, nor for Mikhail to listen) and other bad
qualities. Well, I have had a little opportunity of testing him: I thought that
nothing would come of a conversation between you and me, that there was no sense
in writing. Under the impression of my talk with Mikhail, I wrote at once, in
the heat of the moment, without even reading through the letter, without putting
it off until the next day. The next day I thought: I have been foolish enough to
believe Mikhail. But it turned out that for all his enthusiasm Mikhail was right
to some extent, for we did have our talk, you and I—not
without hitches, of course, and not without Proletary being
annihilated, but that can’t be helped!


All the very best,


N. Lenin

 

Notes
 

[1]
An addition “justly”: I make a reservation. Without understanding their deeds one cannot understand people either, unless it be
... outwardly. That is to say, it is possible to understand the psychology of one or other participant of a struggle, but not the meaning of the
struggle, not its party and political significance.

Dear friend,


I have received your letter of September 20, 1909, and was extremely glad to
hear from you. It is a pity there was no news from you earlier—we are now
terribly isolated here; we tried to get in touch with you and Vyach., but
failed. These are indeed hellishly difficult years and a possibility of
contacts with old friends is ten times more valuable for that reason. I shall
answer your letter point by point. You have seen the newspaper up to December
1908. Since then much water has flowed under the bridge.


With the so-called “Lefts” we have a complete split, which was made
good in the spring of 1909. If you come across my book on philosophy (I sent it
to you immediately it came out, i.e., in the beginning of the summer of 1909)
and the newspaper for 1909, you will hardly say that we are making concessions
to the silly Lefts. There is a complete and formal split with Maximov and the
Maximovites. An out-and-out fight. They may set up their own organ, or they may
not. They are stirring things up in St. Petersburg  and Odessa, but they cannot
become a force; it is the death agony of “otzovism-ultimatumism”, in
my opinion. The split with Maximov and Co. cost us no little energy and time,
but I think it was inevitable and will be useful in the long run. Knowing your
views, I think, I am even confident, that we are in agreement here.


As to what you say about it being time to “liquidate the belief in a
second coming of the general-democratic onset”, I definitely do not agree
with you there. You would only be playing into the hands of the otzovists (who
are very prone to such “maximalism”: the bourgeois revolu-

    

tion is behind us—ahead is the “purely proletarian” one) and
the extreme Right-wing Menshevik liquidators. (Incidentally: have you heard
about the split among the Mensheviks? Plekhanov has left the editorial board of
their newspaper, Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, and the editorial hoard of
their collective work: The Social Movement in Russia in the Twentieth
Century. In August 1909 he published Dnevnik No. 9, where he
called the Mensheviks the accomplices of the
liquidators,[4] and said about Potresov “he is no comrade of mine”, and that
Potresov had ceased to be a revolutionary, and so on. Things with us are moving
towards an alignment with the Plekhanovite Mensheviks with the aim of
strengthening the Party.) But the main thing, in my opinion, is that such a view
is theoretically wrong. The “German line” is possible—without
doubt. And we frankly recognised that as early as the beginning of 1908. But
this possibility can become a reality only through a number of
“general-democratic” onsets (or upsurges, or crises, etc.) just as
France came to the end of the “general-democratic” onsets not after
1789-93, but after 1871 (i.e., after 1830, 1848, and 1871), and Germany not in
1849-50, but also after 1871, i.e., after the
Verfassungsstreit[1]

of
the sixties. Struve, Guchkov and Stolypin are trying their hardest to
“copulate” and produce a Bismarckian Russia—but nothing comes
of it. Nothing. They’re impotent. All the signs show, and they themselves admit,
 that nothing comes of it. Stolypin’s agrarian
policy[5] is
correct from the point of view of Bismarckianism. But Stolypin himself
“asks” for 20 years to make something “come of it”. But
twenty years, and even a shorter time, is impossible in Russia without
1830-1848-1871 (if in the French style) and 1863-1865 (if in the German
style). It is impossible. And all these dates (both 1830-1848-1871 and
1863-1865) are a “general-democratic onset”.


No, we cannot “liquidate” the idea of “a general-democratic
onset”—that would be a cardinal mistake. We should recognise the
possibility of a “German line”, but we should not forget that so far
it does not exist. It simply

    

does not. We should not link the destinies of the proletarian party with the
success or failure of the bourgeois revolution—that is indisputable. We
should organise the work so that, whatever the turn events take, it will be a
stable, unalienable achievement—that is true. But we are obliged to do our
duty as leaders of a democratic, “general-democratic”, movement
right to the end, until the Russian 1871, until the complete turn of the
peasantry to the side of an
Ordnungspartei.[2]

And such a turn, as far as
Russia is concerned, is still a long way off! We cannot deny the possibility
of a “German”, that is to say, a “rotten”, solution of
“general-democratic” problems, but we are obliged to do
everything, we are obliged to work long and hard in order that this
solution will be not “rotten”, not German, but French, i.e., that of
the 1830-1848-1871 type, and not of the 1863-65 type (merely a
“constitutional” crisis). There is no guarantee that our 1863-65
will turn out to be “rotten” or successful, but it is our business,
the business of the working-class party, to do everything to make the
“rotten” develop into the successful, to make the
German Verfassungsstreit develop into a real French scrimmage. There
are no historical laws to prevent a rotten crisis from turning into a real
scrimmage. There are no such laws. Every thing depends on the circumstances, on
the mass of poor peas ants (whom Stolypin has suppressed but not satisfied), on
the strength of the workers’ party, on the conditions, friction and conflicts
between Guchkov and the “spheres”, etc., etc. We should see to it
that we are stronger (and by the time of our 1863-1865 we shall be stronger than
the Germans were then), and that the peasants then do what we tell them, and not
what the liberals tell them. Only the struggle will decide how far this will be
achieved. We shall demand everything in the sense of a “general-democratic
onset”: if successful we shall gain everything, if unsuccessful,—a part; but, in going into battle, we must not confine ourselves to
demanding a part. To build in a new way, to organise in a new way, to enter the
crisis in a new way—such is the crucial feature of the moment,
but all the old

    

slogans, the demand for “everything”, must be maintained,
developed and strengthened.


All the very, very best. I wish you health and good cheer.


Yours whole-heartedly,

Old Man

Skvortsov-Stepanov, Ivan Ivanovich (1870–1928)—one of the
oldest participants in the Russian revolutionary movement, a Marxist
writer. Joined the revolutionary movement in 1892; from, the close of 1904
a Bolshevik. In 1906 a delegate to the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., at which he adopted a Leninist stand. In the period of reaction
(1907–10) adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the Vperyod
faction, but under the influence of Lenin he rectified these errors. He was
repeatedly arrested and exiled for his revolutionary activities.


After the October Socialist Revolution he occupied important government and
Party posts.

Liquidators—adherents of an opportunist trend dominant among the
Mensheviks during the period of reaction following the defeat of the first
Russian revolution of 1905–07. They demanded the liquidation of the
revolutionary illegal party of the proletariat and the creation in its
stead of an opportunist party operating legally within the framework of the
tsarist regime. Lenin and other Bolsheviks untiringly denounced the
liquidators, who were betraying the cause of the revolution. The Prague
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (January 1912) expelled the liquidators from
the Party.

Meaning Stolypin’s agrarian reform aimed at using the kulaks as a bulwark
of the regime in the countryside. The tsarist government issued a Ukase on
November 9 (22), 1906, regulating the peasants’ withdrawal from the
communes and the establishment of their proprietary rights on the allotment
lands. Under this Stolypin law (which got its name from P. A. Stolypin,
Chairman of the Council of Ministers) the peasant was free to with draw
from the village commune, take possession of his allotment on a
proprietorship basis, and sell it. The rural community was obliged to give
the peasants who withdrew from the commune an allotment of land in one
place (an otrub, homestead). The Stolypin reform speeded up the
development of capitalism in the countryside and the process of
differentiation among the peasantry, and sharpened the class struggle in
the village. The Stolypin reform is characterised and evaluated in a number
of works by Lenin, notably in his The Agrarian Programme of
Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution, 1905–1907^^See
Vol. 13 of this edition)^^.

To explain the at first glance strange proposal and re quest which we and the
C.C. are addressing to you, we
must clarify the situation in our Party.


To understand this situation, one must have a clear idea, firstly, of the
violent nature of the counter-revolution and the appalling chaos in the
Social-Democratic organisation and Social-Democratic work; and, secondly, of
the basic ideological and political trends in our Party.


On the first question, it is sufficient to note the tremendous decline among
the organisations everywhere, almost their cessation in many
localities. The wholesale flight of the intelligentsia. All that is left are
workers’ circles and isolated individuals. The young, inexperienced worker is
making his way forward with difficulty.


On the second question. There were two trends among
the Social-Democrats in the revolution (and two factions,
tatsächlich
Spaltung[1]

): the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. Stockholm 1906 and London
1907.[5] An opportunist
and a revolutionary wing.


The 1907-08 break-down gave rise (α) among the Mensheviks—to
liquidationism (definition), (β) among the Bolsheviks—to
otzovizm (and ultimatumism). Definition.


(α) Beginning with March 1908, the Mensheviks took absolutely
no part in the central work of the Party and even tried to disrupt it (August
1908). Abroad they predominate (students, immature bourgeois intellectuals,
etc.). A wide-open split abroad (thanks to the Mensheviks) and

    

their complete non-participation in Party work, plus a struggle
against the Party.


The conference of December 1908 brands
this.[6]


(β) Otzovism-ultimatumism among the Bolsheviks in
1908-09. The Bolsheviks’ resolute struggle against it and
Kaltstellung[2]

of the otzovists and ultimatumists. Removal.


Chaos in Russia increasing.


Plekhanov’s statement, August 1909 (”What Can We Do for
You?”[7] , the liquidationism of Golos; liquidationism
declared to be petty-bourgeois opportunism; acknowledgement of the crisis in
the Party [frightful disease I; resignation from the editorial board of the
Social Movement which had taken refuge in a
b\:urgerlich-liberalen Verlag[3]

).


The significance of Plekhanov’s statement=a feeble echo, the confirmation
by a factional enemy of the Bolsheviks of all their accusations.


The gravitation of the Mensheviks in Russia towards the Party
(particularly in the case of workers: St. Petersburg, Moscow).


Experience of Party unity on this basis, on the recognition of the
struggle on two fronts: against liquidatlonism and against
otzovism-ultimatumism.


Conditions for unity on our part: unconditional recognition of the struggle
against liquidationism (half-measure of the C.C.: a personal concession);
cessation of factional struggle (=of the split abroad in particular) and
loyal subordination to the majority of the Party (Bolsheviks+Poles in particular), which extricated the Party from the 1907-09 crisis
and set it on the path of a resolute struggle on two fronts.


Conditions of the Mensheviks: concealment of a clear definition of
liquidationism (half-measure in the unanimous resolution) and
equality on the editorial board of the Central Organ (virtually the
leading Party body in view of the extreme weakness and instability of the
C.C. in Russia).


In the C.C. an extremely unstable compromise is effected 1) a
unanimous resolution deleting the name liquidation-

    

ism[8] 2) three and two in the C.O., in circumstances of the
Menshevik declaration about “mechanical suppression”, “a state
of siege”, etc.; 3) refusal of the Mensheviks resolutely, clearly and
irrevocably to renounce their factional newspaper and factional
organisation, and to recognise loyal subordination to the Majority.


Hence our fears. Having dissolved the Bolshevik faction and handed over the
money to the C.C. (actually 5 powers in circumstances of an accidental and
wavering majority, marred by otzovism-ultimatumism), we fear (have every ground
for fearing) a split of the Mensheviks abroad and their dragging in of
liquidationism (in the shape of equality on the editorial board).


We are convinced that in view of attempts at a split, organised from abroad by
the Mensheviks, the C.C. (i.e., the Bolsheviks+the nationals) will
not be strong enough to combat liquidationism, and we will have to
resume the factional struggle, reply to the split by a split.


The experience of the “truce”: the Bolsheviks have die—
armed. The experience of the “Party way of life”,


The conditions to be put to the Mensheviks: (α) complete
disarmament—cessation of, the factional newspaper, the factional funds,
the factional split abroad; (β) loyal implementation of the
resolution on the struggle against liquidationism; (γ) loyal
subordination to the majority in the C.O.; (δ) loyal assistance to the C.C. in Russia.


Si non—non!


The flirting of the Mensheviks with the otzovists-ultimatumists. Trotsky’s impotence and connivance in regard to the liquidators.

March 27, 1910


Dear Comrade Mikhail,


How is your health? Are you getting better? Write about this, tell us whether
you are putting on weight and how much.


The fog of conciliatory unity among us is beginning to disperse. I am sending
you a reprint from No. 12 of
Sotsiai-Demokrat[1] You will
see from it that there has been an all-out fight with the Golos
group. The question now boils down to whether there are any Plekhanovites in
existence, whether there are any pro-Party Mensheviks in
existence, or whether all the Mensheviks are Golos supporters,
and Plekhanov is simply an isolated individual.


Intensified agitation has to be carried on for the withdrawal of the
Plekhanovites from the Golos groups, for the replacement of the
Golos supporter in the Bureau of the C.C. Abroad by a
Plekhanovite and so on—and by means of such agitation to verify in
practice whether Party unity will result at least in our unity with
the Plekhanovites or whether nothing at all will come of it.


The group of Bolsheviks here is about to start such agitation; when it does,
you will receive news of it.


The
Vperyodists[2] are holding a sort of meeting here; it is said
that Bogdanov and Stanislav have arrived. What they intend to do is not
known. They are behaving stupidly and the Central Organ will, probably, have to
fight them as well, after their first press statement. There was a letter from
Russia saying that Alexinsky wrote to the Moscow Vperyod group about
their plan to organise a school of their own for 50 people (they have
raised money, then?)

    

but that the Vperyod people in Moscow are said to be inclined
towards a general party school.


There is no correspondence with Gorky. It is rumoured that he has become
disillusioned with Bogdanov and has realised the falsity of the latter’s
behaviour. Have you any news from Capri?


There are few forces in Russia. Ah, if only we could send from here a good
Party worker to the C.C. or for convening a conference! But here everyone
is a “has-been”.


Keep well and write,


All the best.


Yours,


Lenin

organised in December 1909 on the initiative of Bogdanov and Alexinsky; the
group had its press organ of the same name. In 1912 together with the
Menshevik liquidators they joined the general anti-Party bloc (the August
bloc) against the Bolsheviks, which was organised by Trotsky. Lacking
support among the workers, the group virtually fell to pieces in 1913. It
disintegrated completely in 1917, after the February revolution.

My dear comrade,


Fully sharing your idea, stated in Dnevnik No. 11, about the need
for a close and sincere alignment of all genuinely Social-Democratic
elements in the struggle against liquidationism and otzovism, I should
very much like to have a talk with you personally about the present state
of affairs in the Party. If you, too, find this useful and if your health
permits, be so kind as to write me (or wire) a few words as to when you
could meet me in San Remo. I am ready to make the journey for that
purpose.[1]


With comradely greetings,


N. Lenin


Vl. Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, Paris, XIV.

In answer to this letter Plekhanov wrote on April 2, 1910: “I, too, think,
that the only way of coping with the crisis our Party is now living through
is by a close alignment among the Menshevik Marxists and the Bolshevik
Marxists, and I believe that you and I should talk this over.” Plekhanov,
however, wrote that this meeting should be held later. During the
Copenhagen Congress of the Second International, at which Plekhanov and
Lenin wrote to the Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of
Germany protesting against the publication in Vorwärts of an
anonymous article by Trotsky, an agreement was reached between Lenin and
Plekhanov for a joint struggle for the Party and the Party principle
against liquidationism and the liquidators, and for Plekhanov’s
contribution to Rabochaya Gazeta.

April 7, 1910


Dear Comrade M.,


I am sending you the resolution of our local Plekhanovites, or, rather, the
pro-Party
Mensheviks.[1] If it is true that with you in Davos the
pro-Party elements preponderate among the Mensheviks, it is extremely important
that they should respond immediately, rally together one way or another and
come out openly. Obviously, Bolsheviks should be very cautious in
giving such advice to Mensheviks, for even among the Plekhanovites there is no
accusation more terrible, horrible and intolerable than that of “aiding
the Bolsheviks” or of working “for the Bolsheviks”, etc.


In the present confused situation there are, in my opinion, only two ways out:
either back to our own Bolshevik faction, or a determined fight
together with the Plekhanovites for the Party and against the Golos
people. The second alternative is the more desirable, but, it does not
depend on us. So long as it is possible, we shall do all we can for the
second way out. Only after trying out all possibilities, all means
for the second way out, shall we return to the first one.


I am very glad that your acquaintance with pragmatism has begun to turn you
away from Machism. In Russia now they are intensively translating all this
“latest” philosophical muck: Petzoldt and Co., the pragmatists,
etc. This is good: when our people in Russia, especially the Russian workers,
see the teachers of our Bogdanov and Co., au naturel—they will
quickly turn away from both teachers and pupils.

 

To regard truth as an instrument of cognition means, in effect, to go over to
agnosticism, i. e., to abandon materialism. In this and in everything
fundamental, the pragmatists, Machists, empirio-monists are birds of a feather.


With warm greetings and wishing you a speedy and lasting recovery.


Yours,

N. Lenin

April 11, 1910


Dear A. M.,


I did not receive the letter from you and M.F. sent through M. S. Botkina until
today. Before I forget: you can write to me at my private address
(Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, 4, Paris, XIV) and at the address of the
Party—in which case it is safer to use two envelopes, the inner one
marked: for Lenin, private (110, Avenue d’Orléans, Mr. Kotliarenko, Paris, XIV).


I shall try and send you tomorrow the publications you
ask for.


Did I criticise you, and where? It must have been in Diskussionny
Listok
No. 1[1]

C.O.).[2] I am
sending you a copy. If this is not what your informants had in mind, then I
don’t remember anything else at the moment. I wrote nothing else during
that period.


Now about unity. You ask: is this a fact or an anecdote?
I shall have to go back a long way to tell you about this,
for there is something both “anecdotal” (rather trivial)
about this fact, and something serious, in my view.


There have been deep and serious factors leading to Party unity: in the
ideological field—the need to purge Social-Democracy from liquidationism
and otzovism; in the practical field—the terribly difficult plight of the
Party and of all Social-Democratic work, and the coming to maturity of a new
type of Social-Democratic worker.

 

At the C.C. plenum (the “long plenum”—three weeks of agony, all
nerves were on edge, the devil to pay!) to these serious and deep-lying
factors, which were by no means generally recognised, were added minor, petty
factors—a mood of “conciliation in general” (without any
clear idea with whom, for what, and how); hatred of the Bolshevik Centre
for its implacable ideological struggle; squabbling on the part of the
Mensheviks, who were spoiling for a fight, and as a result—an infant
covered with blisters.


And so we have to suffer. Either—at best—we cut open the blisters,
let out the pus, and cure and rear the infant.


Or, at worst—the infant dies. Then we shall be childless for a while
(that is, we shall re-establish the Bolshevik faction) and then give birth to a
more healthy infant.


Among the Mensheviks, those working for serious unity are the Plekhanovites
(not quite consciously, rather slowly and waveringly, but they are nevertheless
working for it, and, what is most important, they cannot help working for it),
the pro-Party-ists and the workers. The Golos people,
however, are fencing, causing confusion and making mischief. They are building
up a strong, legal, opportunist centre in Russia (Potresov &
Co. in the press: see Nasha
Zarya[3] No. 2—what a scoundrel
this Potresov is!—and Mikhail, Roman, Yury+the sixteen authors of the
“Open Letter”[4] in No. 19/20 of Golos—in
practical, organisational work).


The C.C. plenum wanted to unite everyone. Now the Golos people
drop out. This abscess must be removed. It can not be
done without squabbling, rows, nervous strain, mud and “scum”.


We are just now in the thick of this squabbling. Either the C.C. in Russia iops
off the Golos supporters by removing them from important bodies
(such as the Central Organ, etc.)—or our faction will have to be re-established.


In No. 11 of Dnevnik, Piekhanov has given an appraisal of the plenum
which clearly shows that the sincere and serious desire to fight opportunism
now prevails with him over the minor, petty desire to utilise
the Golos opportunists against the Bolsheviks. Here, too,
things take a com plex and protracted course, but the Mensheviks’ legalistic,
liquid ationist centre that has been built up in Russia will

    

inevitably lead to serious Social-Democrats turning away from them.


Now about the Vperyodists. At one time it seemed to me that within this group,
too, there were two trends: towards the Party and Marxism, towards
renouncing Machism and otzovism, and the opposite. As far as the first;
trend is concerned, Party unity would enable the patent absurdities of
otzovism, etc., to be corrected in a convenient and unembarrassing Party
way. But, apparently, the second trend is getting the upper hand among them. Alexinsky (a mere babe-in-arms in politics, but one who has
turned angry and is committing one stupidity after another) kicked up a row and
resigned from both the editorial board of Diskussionny Listok and
from the Party’s School
Committee.418^^ They will probably
organise a school of their own, again a factional one, again on
the side. If they do, we shall fight again and win the workers away from them.


And so it works out, that in the matter of unity the “anecdotic”
predominates at the present time, is brought into high focus, gives
occasion for sniggering and sneering, etc. It is said that the
Socialist-Revolutionary Chernov has even written a farce about unity among
the Social-Democrats entitled “A Storm in a Tea-cup”, and that this farce
will be performed here in a day or two before one of the groups of the
emigrant colony, who are addicted to sensationalism.


It is sickening to be stuck in the midst of this “anecdotic”
situation, this squabbling and row-making, nervous strain and
“scum”; to observe all this is also sickening. But one should not
allow oneself to succumb to the mood. Life in exile is now a hundred times
harder than it was before the revolution. Life in exile and squabbling are
inseparable.


But the squabbling will pass away; nine-tenths of it remains abroad; it is an
accessory feature. The development of the Party, the development of the
Social-Democratic movement goes forward despite all the devilish
difficulties of the present situation. The purging of the Social-Democratic Party from its dangerous “deviations”, from liquidationism and otzovism goes forward steadfastly; within the
framework of unity it has progressed considerably farther
    

than before. As a matter of fact, we had finished with otzovism ideologically
before the plenum. We had not finished with liquidationism at that time; the
Mensheviks succeeded temporarily in hiding the snake, but now it has
been dragged out into broad daylight, now everyone sees it, now we shall kill
it!


And this purging is by no means only an “ideological” task, a labour
of armchair workers as that fool (or rogue) Potresov thinks, who stands
up for the Machists the way the Mensheviks at the plenum stood up for the
Vperyodists. No, this purge is inseparably bound up with the mass working-class movement, which learns how to organise Social-Democratic work in
the present difficult period, learns precisely by rejection, finds the
right path by rejecting liquidationism and otzovism. Only that windbag
Trotsky imagines that this rejection can be avoided, that it is superfluous, that it does not concern the workers, that the issues of
liquidationism and otzovism have been posed not by life itself, but by the wicked polemicists.


I can imagine how distressing the sight of this painful growth of the new
Social-Democratic movement must be to those who have not seen and lived through
its painful growth in the late eighties and early nineties. At that time such
Social-Democrats were to be counted by the score, if not in individuals. Now
there are hundreds and thou sands of them. Hence the crisis and crises. And the
Social-Democratic movement as a whole is coping with them openly and
will overcome them honestly.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin

Dear N. A.,


We must meet as soon as possible to talk about the speediest
convocation of a meeting of Bolsheviks (anti-Vperyodists). Yesterday
Mark+Lozovsky+Lyova departed with a protest against a factional
newspaper.[2] The funny fellows! I am glad that the muddlers are out
of it, but we must speedily ascertain the attitude of the remaining people. If possible come out as quickly as you can and take steps for an early
meeting.


Yours,

Lenin

October 7, 1910


Dear Comrade,


I received the letter from you and Wurm and your article late yesterday
evening. In accordance with your and Kautsky’s request, lasse ich es
bei Ihrem Artikel
bewenden.[1]


I have already written about half of a long article against both Martov and
Trotsky.[2]

I shall have to leave it and start on an article against
Trotsky. Since you meet Kautsky, please toll him that I am taking care
of the reply to Trotsky. If the Germans are so afraid of a polemic, I
don’t think it matters much whether the reply comes a week earlier or a
week later?


What a pity that even Kautsky and Wurm do not see how disgusting and mean such
articles as those of Martov and Trotsky are. I shall try to write at least a
private letter to Kautsky to clarify the matter. It is really a down right
scandal that Martov and Trotsky lie with impunity and write scurrilous lampoons
in the guise of “scientific” articles!


By the way, could you help me to clear up two practical questions. First: could
a translator from Russian into German be found in Berlin (for articles for
Neue Zeit)? Or is this unreliable and expensive, so that it would be
better to look for someone here? I shall look out for someone here In any case,
hut I should like to know your opinion, as you have considerable experience in
this respect.

 

Second: what if I were to write a pamphlet (of a size á la.
Cherevanin: Das Proletariat in der russischen Revoiution) on the
subject of the Russian revolution, its lessons, class struggle, etc. Could a
German party publisher be found or not? Do the Germans pay for such things, or
must payment be looked for only from the Russians, while the Germans are served
nebenbei?


In connection with the reply to Martov, I have dug into some very interesting
strike statistics of 1905-08 and should very much like to analyse them. It is a
subject more suitable for a book or pamphlet than for an
article.[3]

But the
Germans are disgracefully “unconscious” in questions concerning the
appraisal of the Russian revolution!


I enclose a brief enumeration of what it is desirable to add against Martov. If
you include even a part of it in your article, it would be very
good.[18]


Beste Grüsse.


Yours,

Lenin


Here, in my opinion, are the chief (not all, by far) points of
Martov’s lies and falsehood which it is desirable to point out (if not in
full, at least in part):


In saying that Comrade Radek is misquoting, Comrade Martov casts suspicion
without giving proof. We, however, have full proof that Martov quotes
falsely. “So far we have been speaking French” (Die Neue
Zeit, 1910), Martov quotes Lenin. The quotation is
distorted. Lenin said: “During the revolution we learned to
’speak French”’
(Proletary No. 46)[4]

. By distorting the
quotation, Martov contrives to conceal the fact that he (like all opportunists)
calls on the workers to unlearn the methods of revolutionary struggle.


“To speak French”—“richtiger gesagt:
blanquistisch”,[5]

is Martov’s emendation. We thank him for his
frankness. To call the participation of the French proletariat in the French
revolutions “Blanquism” is precisely the “essence” of the
views of Martov and
Queesel.[19]

 

“In ganz Westeuropa,” writes Martov, “betrachtet man
die Bauernmassen in dem Masse für bündnisfähig, als sie die schweren Folgen
der kapitalistischen Umwälzung der Landwirtschaft zu spüren bekommen
...; für Russland malte man sich ein Bild aus, wie mit dem
Proletariat sich die 100 Millionen Bauern vereinigen..., die noch nicht
von der kapitalistischen Bourgeoisie in die Schule genommen worden sind”
(Neue Zeit, Seite 909). Das ist eben russisches
Quesseltum![6]


The Russian Quessel forgot to mention that in the agrarian
programme of the Russian Social-Democrats (adopted In Stockholm, 1906, when
the Mensheviks had a majority!) it is stated “support for the
revolutionary actions of the peasantry to the extent of confiscation
of the landed estates”. Is there anything like this in
“Europe”, O Russian Quessel? There is not, for in Europe the
questions of a bourgeois revolution are no longer
revolutionary issues. The “school of the capitalist
bourgeoisie” as far as the Russian peasants are concerned is a school of
betrayals and treachery on the part of the liberal bourgeoisie (which has been
betraying the peasants to the landowners and absolutism), and only
extreme opportunists are capable of defending such a school.


In scoffing at the “union with the proletariat of 100 mil lion
peasants”, Martov is scoffing at the whole revolution, which has
demonstrated such a union in practice both in the arena of the uprising
(October, November-December, 1905) and in the arena of both Dumas
(1906-1907).


Martov vacillates helplessly between the liberals (they are against
“confiscation of the landed estates”, against
“revolutionary actions of the peasantry”) and the Social-Democrats,
who so far have by no means withdrawn their support of the peasant
uprising or their statement to this effect contained in their
programme.

 

Martov believes that during the years of revolution (1905-07) it was
not the question of a republic, but “die Frage der
Unabhängigkeit der Volksvertretung”
(S. 918)[7]

that was on the order
of the day. Independence from whom? From the monarchy which had
carried out
Staatsstreiche?[8]

The Russian opportunists forget at least the
connection between the agrarian and the political revolution (is it possible
to fight for the confiscation of the landed estates without fighting for a
republic?); they forget that the era of Staatsstreiche, der Aufstände,
der
Niederwerfungsstreiks,[9]

by virtue of its
obective conditions and not of our will, puts the question of
a republic on the order of the day. The “republic” as a slogan of
the day in 1905==“romanticism”;
“independence” (from the monarchy which carries out
Staatsstreiche and wages den
Bürgerkrieg)[10]

=Realpolitik,
is not that so, O Russian Quessel?


Apropos. Rosa Luxemburg argued with Kautsky as to whether in Germany the moment
had arrived for
Niederwerfungsstrategie,[11]

and Kautsky plainly and bluntly stated that he considered this
moment was unavoidable and imminent but had not yet arrived. But Martov,
“deepening
(verballhornend[12]

)

Kautsky, denies the applicability of
the Niederwerfungsstrategie to the year 1905 in Russia! Martov finds
that the uprising in December 1905 was
evoked “künstlich”[13]

(Neue Zeit, S. 913). Die Leute, welche so glauben, können
nur künstlich zur Sozialdemokratie gerechnet
werden. Natürlich sind sie
Nationalliberale.[14]


Martov ridicules the view that the proletariat is “die
ausschlaggebende Macht”
(S. 909)[15]

in the revolution. So far only the
liberals have dared (and not always, at that)

    

to deny the indisputable historical fact that in 1905 the Russian proletariat
actually played the part of “der ausschlaggebenden
Macht”. And when a theory which denies the “hegemony of the
proletariat in the Russian revolution” gained the upper hand in the
five-volume Social Movement (edited by Martov and Potresov), Plekhanov
resigned from the editorial board and declared the Social
Movement a work of liquidators. Martov now represents not Menshevism as a
whole but only that kind of Menshevism which Plekhanov, who has remained a
Menshevik, has repudiated and which he has called opportunism.


Martov contraposes the Russian boycott of 1906 to the anarchists’ defence of
boycott (“political abstention”) “in ganz
Westeuropa”. We have already spoken about the boycott of 1906 (you
have already dealt with this). But speaking of boycott in general, why did
Martov forget the chief application of a boycott in the Russian
revolution, the boycott of the Bulygin Duma (the law of August 6, 1905)?
Against this boycott were all the liberals, even those of the Left
(Osvobozhdeniye League), in favour of it were the Bolshevik Social-Democrats. Is
it because this boycott was victorious that Martov is silent about it?
Is it because this boycott was the slogan of a victorious
Niederwerfungsstrategie?


All the Mensheviks (especially in Nasha Zarya, Vozrozhdeniye and
Zhizn[20]) seized on Rosa Luxemburg’s dispute with
Kautsky in order to declare K. Kautsky a “Menshevik”. Martov is
trying his hardest, by means of kleinliche und miserable Diplomatie,
to deepen the gulf between Rosa Luxemburg and K. Kautsky. These
elende[16]

devices cannot succeed. Revolutionary Social-Democrats may
argue about the timing of Niederwerfungsstrategie in Germany,
but not of its appropriateness in Russia in 1905. It has never
occurred to Kautsky to deny its appropriateness for Russia in
1905. Only liberals and German and Russian Quessels can deny that!


Well then, will not the upshot of the question of the mass strike in Magdeburg
(the acceptance of Rosa’s resolution and her withdrawal of the second
part) make for peace be-

    

tween her and Kautsky? and the Vorstand? Or will it not be
soon?[21] ((I wrote to Rosa Luxemburg a couple of weeks ago
from Stockholm.))


My address is: Vl. Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, 4, Paris, XIV.

Dear Comrade,


Many thanks for the letter and news of the Plekhanovite agitation. All such
information, which gives us an accurate idea of the moods prevailing among the
Social-Democrats abroad, is now extremely valuable to us. I too am thinking of
going on a lecture tour in Switzerland (Geneva, Lausanne, Berne,
Zurich[2] ). I don’t know whether the journey will be worth it.


Regarding a bloc with Plekhanov, I think you are quite right that we should be
in favour of it. Since 1909 I have been wholly in favour of a
rapprochement with the Plekhanovites. And even more so now. We can and
should build the Party only with the Plekhanovites—the Vperyod
and Golos people should have been given up as hopeless long ago. It is
a mistake to think that the Plekhanovites are weak, mere “ciphers”
(as is sometimes said), etc. That is an impression existing abroad. I am deeply
convinced that nine-tenths of the Menshevik workers in Russia are
Plekhanovites. The whole history of Menshevism in the revolution vouches for the
fact that Plekhanovism is the best (and therefore the most viable) product of
the proletarian stream of Mensheviks.


In Copenhagen, Plekhanov and I talked about publishing a popular newspaper. It
is essential. (Trotsky has clearly turned to the liquidators, to support of the
Golos group, to disruption of the Party bloc between the
Bolsheviks and Plekhanovites.) Plekhanov and I fully agree that nothing can be
done with Trotsky. We shall either establish a popular newspaper under the
C.O., or separately by the group of Bolsheviks. Plekhanov has promised
to contribute. Money will be needed—we have exceedingly little. I am hop-

    

ing for every assistance from you. We are struggling hard to establish a
periodical in Russia (à la Vozrozhdeniye or Zhizn). We
can’t get the thing going, there is no secretary, no one through whom to
arrange things—our people are continually being arrested, worse luck! Yet
a periodical is
Essential.[3]


All the best.


Yours,


Lenin

November 14, 1910


Dear A. M.,


There has been no news from you and M. F. for a very long time. I have been
looking forward eagerly to news from Capri. What’s wrong? Surely you
don’t keep count of letters as some people are said to keep count of
visits.


Everything here is as of, old. A host of trivial affairs and all kinds of
trouble connected with the struggle of the various “dominions”
inside the Party. Brrr!... It must be nice on Capri....


By way of relaxation from the squabbling we have taken up the old plan of
publishing Rabochaya Gazeta. With difficulty we raised 400
francs. Yesterday No. 1 came out at last. I am sending you a copy together with
a leaflet and a subscription
list.[1] Members of the Capri-Neapolitan
colony who sympathise with such an enterprise (and with the
“rapprochement” between the Bolsheviks and Plekhanov) are invited
to afford every assistance. Rabochaya Gazeta is necessary, but we
can’t make a go of it with Trotsky, who is intriguing in favour of the
liquidators and the otzovists and Vperyod supporters. Already in
Copenhagen Plekhanov and I protested vigorously against Trotsky’s despicable article in Vorwärts. And what a disgusting article he has
published in Neue Zeit, too, on the historical significance of the
struggle among the Russian
Social-Democrats[2]! And
Lunacharsky’s in the Belgian Le Peuple—have you seen it?


We are setting up a small legal periodical to combat Nasha Zarya and
Zhizn—this, too, with Plekhanov’s participation. We hope
to issue No. 1
soon.[3]

 

And so we jog along. Little by little, hard and slowly we are making headway,
extricating ourselves from the squabbles.


What is the news with you? Did you write to Stroyev and what reply did you
receive? We wrote a first letter to him to “make contact”; he
received it and replied that he did not understand who was writing. We wrote
again. Not a word. There’s a terrible shortage of the right people, and
the old ones have dispersed.


Arrangements were on the point of completion in St. Petersburg for putting out a
weekly newspaper together with the Duma group (the Mensheviks there fortunately
incline not towards the liquidators, but towards Plekhanov), but the matter has
been held up again, the devil knows
why.[4]


Write how you are getting on. Is your work going well? Has anything come
of the journal we talked about in the summer? How are things with
Znaniye?[5]


I have the right to be cross with M. F. She promised to write. Nothing has
come. She promised to find out about the Paris library on the history of the
Russian revolution. Nothing has come. That’s bad.


All the best.


Yours,


Lenin


Tria’s report will, probably, be published after all. The
editorial board of the
C.O.[6] decided this. But the squabbling
on that editorial board—ye gods!...

Dear A. M.,


November 22, 1910


I wrote you a few days ago when sending Rabochaya Gazeta, and asked
what had come of the journal we talked about in the summer and about which you
promised to write to me.


I see in Rech today a notice about Sovremennik, published
“with the closest and exclusive [that is what is printed!
illiterately, but so much the more pretentiously and significantly I
participation of Amfiteatrov” and with you as a regular
contributor.[1]


What is this? How does it happen? A “large monthly” journal, with
sections on “politics, science, history, social life”—why,
this is something quite different from symposia aiming at a concentration of
the best forces of belles-lettres. Such a journal should either have a
perfectly definite, serious and consistent trend, or it will
inevitably disgrace itself and those taking part in it. Vestnik
Yevropy[2] has a trend—a poor, watery, worthless
trend—but one which serves a definite element, certain sections of the
bourgeoisie, and which also unites definite circles of the professorate and
officialdom, and the so-called intelligentsia from among the
“respectable” (or rather, would-be respectable)
liberals.
Russkaya Mysl[3] has a trend, an odious trend, but
one which performs a very good service for the counter-revolutionary liberal
bourgeoisie. Russkoye
Bogatstvo[4] has a trend—a
Narodnik, Narodnik-Cadet trend—but one which has kept its line for scores
of years, and which serves definite sections of the
population. Sovremenny
Mir[5] has a trend—often Menshevik-Cadet trend (at present
with a leaning towards pro-Party Menshevism)—but a trend A journal without
a trend is an absurdity, a ridiculous, scandalous and harmful thing. And what
sort of trend can there be with

    

the “exclusive participation” of Amfiteatrov? One cannot expect
G. Lopatin to provide a trend, and if the talk (said also to have got into the
newspapers) is true about Kachorovsky’s participation, then that is a
“trend”, but a trend of the blockheads, a S.R. trend.


During our talk in the summer when I told you that I had all but written you a
disappointed letter about Confessions but did not send it because of
the split with the Machists which had begun at that time, you replied:
“it’s a pity you did not send it”. Then
you went on to reproach me for not going to the Capri
school,[6] and
you said that, if matters had taken a different course, the breakaway of the
Machists and otzovists might have cost you less nervous strain, less waste of
energy. Recalling these talks, I have now decided to write to you without
putting it off and without waiting for any verification, while the impression
the news has made is still fresh.


I think that a political and economic monthly with the exclusive participation
of Amfiteatrov is something many times worse than a special Machist-otzovist
faction. What was and still is bad about this faction is that the
ideological trend deviated and still deviates from Marxism, from Social-Democracy, without, however, going so far as a break with Marxism, and only
creating confusion.


Amfiteatrov’s journal (his
Krasnoye Znamya[7] did
well to die when it did!) is a political act, a political enterprise in which
there is not even a realisation that a general “leftism” is not
enough for a policy, that after 1905 to talk seriously about politics without
making clear one’s attitude towards Marxism and Social-Democracy is out of
the question, impossible, inconceivable.


Things are turning out bad. It’s saddening.


Yours,

Lenin


To M.F.—salut et fraternité.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Sovremennik (The Contemporary)—a monthly literary and political
journal, published in St. Petersburg in 1911–15. Grouped around it were
Menshevik liquidators, Socialist-Revolutionaries, “Popular Socialists”
and Left liberals. The journal had no ties whatever with the working-class
masses. A leading role in the journal at the beginning of its existence was
played by A. V. Amfiteatrov.


As a result of Lenin’s letter, Gorky demanded that the words in the
announcement describing him as “regular contributor” should be
deleted^^(see V. I. Lenin and A. M. Gorky, Letters, Reminiscences,
Documents, Second Russ. ed., Moscow, 1961, p. 59)^^. Gorky broke with
Sovremennik in August 191l, but resumed his contributions in 1912
when Amfiteatrov resigned from the editorial staff.





[2]
Vestnik Yevropy (European Messenger)—a monthly magazine devoted
to politics, history and literature, bourgeois-liberal in trend, published
in St. Petersburg from 1866 to 1918.





[3]
Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought)—a monthly literary and political
journal published in Moscow from 1880 to 1918. Up to 1905 it was of a
liberal-Narodnik trend. In the nineties it sometimes published articles of
the Marxists. After the revolution of 1905 it became the organ of the Right
wing of the Cadet Party. The editor was P. B. Struve.

I have received your two letters, which surprised me.
What could be easier, it would seem, than to write and
tell us simply and clearly what is the matter? We are still
in the dark. It should not be difficult to find a person to
write sensibly, clearly and frankly at least once a week.


Your attempt to detach
the liquidators from liquidationism is unfortunate to a degree. We have never
approved this distinction. Only sophists draw it. We earnestly re quest you not
to believe the sophists and not to make this distinction. One can reconcile
oneself to anything but the liquidators, and if you do not want the work to be
ruined, keep them out of it.


With great difficulty we obtained from a publisher hero a further thousand
rubles and will send them to you tomorrow. If this publisher approaches you
again with questions, advice, conditions, and so on—don’t answer at
all, or answer as we once advised.


Concerning the little magazine, we have had nothing from anyone.


So we repeat once more our insistent request: we have obtained for you what you
require, see that you do not let us down, keep out the liquidators (there is no
such thing as liquidationism without liquidators. And who could have played
such a cruel joke on you by assuring you of a distinction between
liquidationism and the liquidators?) and, further, see to it that we get a
sensible, clear, frank and detailed letter every week. Surely these two
requests are not difficult, not too much; we cannot manage without it.


Yours....

January 3, 1911


Dear A. M.,


I have long been intending to reply to your letter but intensification of
the
squabbling[1]

here (a hundred thousand devils take it!) distracted me.


But I should like to have a chat with you.


First of all, before I forget: Tria has been arrested together with Jordania and
Ramishvili. It is reported as being true. A pity, for he is a good chap. A
revolutionary.


Regarding Sovremennik. In Rech today I read the contents of
the first issue and I am cursing and swearing. Vodovozov on Muromtsev
... Kolosov on Mikhailovsky, Lopatin “Not ours”, etc. You
can’t help swearing. And here are you, teasing as it were: “realism,
democracy, activity”.


Do you think these are good words? They are bad words, used by all the
bourgeois tricksters in the world, from the Cadets and S.R.s in our country to
Briand or Millerand here, Lloyd George in Britain, etc. The words are bad,
turgid, and they carry a S.R.-Cadet message. It’s not good.


As regards Tolstoy, I fully share your opinion that hypocrites and rogues will
make a saint of him. Plekhanov, too, was infuriated by all the lying and
sycophancy around Tolstoy, and in here we see eye to eye. He criticises
Nasha Zarya for it in the C.O.
(the next issue),[3] and I am
doing so in
Mysl[2]

(No. 1 arrived today. Congratulate us on our
own little journal in Moscow, a Marxist one. This has been a happy day for
us). Zvezda No. 1. (it appeared on December

    

16 in St. Petersburg) also contains a good article by Plekhanov with a
trivial comment, for which we have already scolded the
editors. It was probably concocted by that ninny Yordansky, together
with Bonch! But how come Sovremennik to combat the “legend about
Tolstoy and his religion”. Is it Vodovozov with Lopatin? You must be
joking.


That they have started hitting out at the students is, in my opinion,
comforting, but Tolstoy must not be allowed to get away with either
“passivism” or anarchism or Narodism or religion.


As regards quixotism in the international policy of Social-Democracy, I think,
you are wrong. It is the revisionists who have long been asserting that colonial
policy is progressive, that it implants capitalism and that therefore it is
senseless to “accuse it of greed and cruelty”, for “without
these qualities” capitalism is “hamstrung”.


It would be quixotism and whining if Social-Democrats were to tell the workers
that there could be salvation some where apart from the development of
capitalism, not through the development of capitalism. But we do not say
this. We say: capital devours you, will devour the Persians, will devour
everyone and go on devouring until you overthrow it. That is the truth. And we
do not forget to add: except through the growth of capitalism there is no
guarantee of victory over it.


Marxists do not defend a single reactionary measure, such as banning
trusts, restricting trade, etc. But to each his own. Let Khomyakov and
Co. build railways across Persia, let them send
Lyakhovs,[4] but the
job of the Marxists is to expose them to the workers. If it devours,
say the Marxists, if it strangles, fight back.


Resistance to colonial policy and international plunder by
means of organising the proletariat, by means of defending freedom
for the proletarian struggle, does not retard the development of
capitalism but accelerates it, forcing it to resort to more civilised,
technically higher methods of capitalism. There is capitalism and
capitalism. There is
Black-Hundred-Octobrist[5] capitalism and
Narodnik (“realistic, democratic”, full of
“activity”) capitalism. The more we expose capitalism
before the workers for its “greed and cruelty”, the more difficult
is it for capitalism

    

of the first order to persist, the more surely is it bound to pass into
capitalism of the second order. And this just suits us, this just suits the
proletariat.


You think I have fallen into a contradiction? In the be ginning of the letter I
considered the words “realism, democracy, activity” bad words, and
now I find them good? There is no contradiction here; what is bad for the
proletariat is good for the bourgeois.


The Germans have an exemplary journal of the opportunists: Sozialistische
Monatshefte. There gentlemen like Schippel and Bernstein have long been
attacking the international policy of the revolutionary Social-Democrats by
raising an outcry that this policy resembles the “lamentations of
compassionate” people. That, brother, is a trick of opportunist
swindlers. Ask for this journal to be sent to you from Naples and have their
articles translated if you are interested in international politics. You
probably have such opportunists in Italy too, only there are no Marxists in Italy, that’s what makes her so nasty.


The International proletariat is pressing capitalism in two ways: by converting
Octobrist capitalism into democratic capitalism and, because it drives
Octobrist capitalism away from itself, by transplanting this
capitalism to the savages. This, however, enlarges the basis of capitalism and
brings its death nearer. There is practically no Octobrist capitalism left in
Western Europe; practically all capitalism is democratic. Octobrist capitalism
has gone from Britain and France to Russia and Asia. The Russian revolution
and the revolutions in Asia=the struggle for ousting Octobrist capitalism and
replacing it by democratic capitalism. And democratic capitalism=the last of
its kind. It has no next stage to go on to. The next stage is its death.


What do you think of Zvezda and Mysl? The former is dull, in
my opinion. But the latter is all ours and I am delighted with it. I’m
afraid they’ll soon close it down, though.


I was wondering whether you could arrange for my book on the agrarian question
to go to Znaniye. Talk it over with Pyatnitsky. I just can’t find a
publisher, not for love or
money.[6]


Reading your postscript: “my hands are shaking and freezing” makes
me indignant. What wretched houses you

    

have on Capri! It’s a disgrace, really! Even we here have central heating; and your “hands are freezing”. You must revolt.


All the very best.


Yours,


Lenin


I have received from Bologna an invitation to come to the school there (20
workers). I have turned it
down.[7] I don’t want to have
anything to do with the Vperyodists. We’re trying again to get the workers
to come here.

The Black Hundreds were monarchist gangs of pogromists organised

Octobrists—members of the Octobrist party (or Union of October
Seventeenth), a counter-revolutionary party of the big industrial
bourgeoisie and landowners who engaged in capitalist farming. It was
founded in November 1905. While paying lip service to the Manifesto of
October 17, in which the tsar, frightened by the revolution, promised the
people “civil liberties” and a constitution, the Octobrists unreservedly
supported the home and foreign policies of the tsarist government. The
leaders of the Octobrists were the well-known industrialist A. Guchkov and
the owner of vast estates M. Rodzyanko.





[6]
Lenin is apparently referring to his book The Agrarian Question in
Russia Towards the Close of the Nineteenth Century written in 1908 for
the Granat Bros. Encyclopaedia. It was not published there for censorship
reasons, and Lenin intended, as his letter indicates, to have it published
by the Znaniye book publishers. However, it was first published in Moscow
in 1918 as a separate booklet by the Zhizn i Znaniye Publishing House ^^(see
Vol. 15 of this edition)^^.





[7]
The anti-Party school in Bologna (November 1910–March 1911) was a
continuation of the Capri school. Lecturers at this school were Bogdanov,
Lunacharsky, Trotsky, Lyadov, Maslov, Sokolov and others. An invitation to
read lectures there was turned down by Lenin in view of the anti-Party
tendency and splitting activities of the school’s organisers. Lenin invited
the students to Paris, where he promised to read them a number of lectures
on the questions of tactics, the situation within the Party and the
agrarian question. The lectures in Paris did not take place.

Saturday, February 25, 1911


Dear Vlasov,


I have just received your letter and I hasten to reply at once without waiting
for Grigory, who forwarded Samovarov’s letter on to you today.


Nadya is writing today to Lyubich. What a pity you didn’t think of it
before. Now you must write to him not about preparing to leave, but about
immediate departure. Write to him again, insisting emphatically on immediate
departure, otherwise the enemy will have four (the Bundist+the Lett+two
Mensheviks) and we’ll have no more than that (three, of whom one is
doubtful,+one Pole).


Your letter concerning the declaration grieves me very much, for I see from it
how inadequate our agreement still is and hence (to my extreme regret)
how “precarious” it is.


Among the changes proposed by you, there are some to which no objections can be
made. These include: dealing with the question of affairs abroad in a special
resolution; adding to the declaration a special paragraph on the significance
of the. Duma and on the fact that those not assisting in the elections to the
Fourth Duma are traitors; separating the question of renewing the
primary Party cells (although I do not understand why it should
be separated and where it should be put. It must be dealt with, however! But
where?).


But you propose many more changes that are unacceptable and harmful.


(“To recognise that the conference is urgent”? Why try to be cunning? You
don’t believe in it yourself! To breed hypocrisy and
self-deception—there is nothing more harmful than that just now!)

 

“To express satisfaction that otzovism-ultimatumism has in effect
disappeared from the political horizon”....


That is untrue. I have seen workers who support Vperyod, and
even Yevgeny in his speeches refutes this untruth.


“To welcome the decision of the Vperyod group to take part in the
elections”....


There has been no such decision so far. And if it does appear tomorrow,
it is scandalous “to welcome” the splitters for doing their
duty and to keep silent about the expro
funds.[2]


You write: “I know of no otzovist or ultimatumist statements of
Vperyod after the plenum”....


You ought to know better. Just look: (1) The leaflet of the Vperyod
group after the plenum: sheer abuse of the central bodies—not a word
about renouncing the otzovist ultimatumist platform. (2) The symposium
No. 1[3]—ditto. Not a single guiding article on the
Duma and Duma activities. (3) Lunacharsky in Le Peuple (it is
quoted in the C.O.—Lunacharsky was officially delegated by the Vperyod
group to the Copenhagen Congress). (4) The leaflet of the Geneva
Vperyod group (it is quoted in part in Golos S.-D.), which
lines up with Lunacharsky.


Vperyod, after the plenum, was in duty bound to issue
a new platform, since the old one (it came out on December
27, 1909, i.e., on the eve of the plenum) is an otzovist-ultimatumist platform. Vperyod has not done this!


Your basic mistake is that you believe words and close your eyes to
deeds. A lot of “good words” have been told you by various people
like Domov or Alexinsky and I don’t know who else, and you believe
them. You write: Vperyod “is on the eve of dissolution or is a
possible ally of ours”, it “is freeing itself from the
otzovist-ultimatumist platform”.


This is untrue. They are the lying words of swindlers who are ready to
promise anything so long as they can disguise the facts, namely, their
own special school, their 85,000 rubles of expro money.


What if Domov does move away from Vperyod—Domov is a high school
teacher, a philistine, an ignorant old woman, and not a politician. What if
Alexinsky has “quarrelled” with Bogdanov and Co.—now,
after returning from

    

Bologna, he has quite made it up again and yesterday delivered a lecture on
behalf of the Vperyod group!


You put your trust in words and leave yourself helpless in
deeds—which means repeating the fatal error of the plenum,
an error which has weakened the Party for a year at least. If you now,
a year after the idiotic conciliatory errors of the plenum, repeat
these errors, you will completely ruin all prospects of “unity”. I
say this with the fullest conviction, for I know it thoroughly from experience. Leave it to Samovarov to shout about my having wrecked
“unity” (this is the catch-phrase of Trotsky and Yonov. Samovarov
has to shout this nonsense (which he dares not utter in print
and which I have publicly dealt with and refuted in No. 2 of
Diskussionny
Listok[1]

, for he is ashamed to admit the mistake
the conciliators made at the plenum. Their mistake was that they almost ruined
the prospect of unity with the pro-Party Mensheviks, by believing the
words of the anti-Party Golosists and allowing them to consolidate
themselves in deeds.


Mind you don’t repeat this mistake!


The Vperyodists are very strong. They have a school=a conference=agents. We (and
the C.C.) have not. They have money—some 80,000 rubles. You think
they will give it to you? Are you really so naïve?


And if not, how can you regard as “allies” factionalists who are keeping a factional fund against you!


It is the height of naïvetá to write: “I do not want to make it difficult
for the Vperyod splinter elements to achieve a rapprochement.”


They have achieved a rapprochement with the liquidators, they have organised a
school against you, they are pulling the wool over your eyes, saying: we are all
right, we are not otzovists, and you believe their words and do not combat
their deeds. It’s the limit, really!


You write: “I should not like to have the Vperyodists expelled from the
general Party (not factional) organisation abroad.”


Either the one or the other: either you encourage a special

    

faction and let it keep its money, in which case we shall publish our
statement to the C.C. (demanding a committee of enquiry) and say: let the
Vperyodists help such a C.C.,
we shall not do so.


Or you condemn the factionalism of the Vperyodists, in which case you
have to he consistent. By condemning in words only, you make yourself
ridiculous.


In that case it must be said: so long as the Vperyodists (1) do not
publish a new platform, (2) do not make pro-Party statements, (3) do
not dissolve their factional school, (4) do not hand over their
factional funds to the Party—they remain an anti-Party faction.


If you do not say this, you will lose our co-operation without gaining that of the Vperyodists. Is that good policy?


As for the splinter elements (future ones!), do not worry about
that. If we are strong, they will all come to us. If we are weak, if we
believe in words, we shall be laughed at, that’s all. To find the right
form is not so difficult: for example, after condemning the Vperyod
faction, to say that part of the Vperyodist workers
stand for elections, for legal opportunities, for the Party principle, and that
you call on such workers, such Vperyodists, to come away from the
faction and to the Party, etc., etc.


In the resolution on unity abroad it should be clearly specified who
the disrupters are: the Golosists and Vperyodists must be
named, and it must be explained wherein lies their “disruption
and anti-Partyism”: not in ideas (argue and write about this in
Diskussionny Listok, etc.) but in the special school, in the
special school funds, in the special organ (Golos), in the special
collections for Golos, and in the special factional groups (which
maintain contacts with Russia against the C.C.).


If the Golosists and Vperyodists are not precisely and clearly named, the whole
resolution=0. In that case you will compel us to come out against this
playing at unity.


If you name them precisely and say clearly what their factionalism is,
you will immediately and definitely win over the majority of our
people abroad (the Bolsheviks+ the Plekhanovites+pro-Party
workers+the bulk of the groups in the “provinces”
and in America, where there are no leaders of Golosism).

 

If the C.C.’s “struggle” against factions consists in its
paying court to the anti-Party factions of Golos and
Vperyod, in hampering our work (in a Party spirit) by
multi-storey formalities (the Pole, a committee, a collegium of people who are
not acquainted with the matter, “invitation” of Vperyodists, quarrel
with Alexinsky, etc., etc.), then you can count us out.


We have just received a letter from St. Petersburg. Samovarov has proposed to
the Social-Democratic Duma group that it issue an electoral platform!


This—to a majority of Mensheviks! (and not a word to us). If Samovarov
wants to carry on in this fashion, I promise you that I shall begin a
series of leaflets directly against Samovarov.


If an agreement among us is possible, the Bolsheviks must rally into a
trend and work harmoniously (on the basis of the agreement),
and not carry on intrigues, nor go over to the Mensheviks.


Write and let me know your opinion as soon as possible.


All the best.


Yours,


Lenin


P.S. Have you seen Nikitich? Has he tried to sell the story of
Vperyod’s peace-loving nature? He’s a great hand at making
promises and throwing dust in people’s eyes.

May 27, 1911


Dear A. M.,


A few days ago I received a letter from Poletayev. He writes, inter alia:
“We have received a letter from Gorky. He is proposing that N. I. should
come abroad to work out a plan for unity around some organ, and adds that he has
spoken to you about this and to the Menshevik M” (Martov, I assume).


Poletayev adds that N. I. is hardly suitable for this plan and that if somebody
must come, it should be somebody else. It is hardly likely that Pokrovsky will
make the journey.


Reading this in Poletayev’s letter frightened me—no, really.


Our uniting with Mensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless, as I
told you here. If we start arranging a meeting for such a hopeless
plan—the result will be nothing but a disgrace (personally I would not go
even to a meeting with Martov).


Judging from Poletayev’s letter, the participation of the Duma group is
planned. Is this necessary? If it is a question of a journal, then the Duma
group has nothing to do with it. If it is a question of a newspaper, it should
be borne in mind that we have had plenty of discord as it is with
Zvezda: they have no line, they are afraid of going with us, afraid of
going with the liquidators, they play hot and cold, they give themselves airs,
they vacillate.


Besides, a union of the Plekhanovites+our people+the Duma group
threatens to give Plekhanov a preponderance, for Mensheviks predominate
in the Duma group. Is it desirable and reasonable to give Plekhanov a
preponderance?


I very much fear that Yordansky is unsuitable for such plans (for he
has “his” own journal and he will either raise

    

obstacles or try to impose “his” journal, leaving it as
his, that is, a semi-liberal organ).


To avoid disappointments and hopeless squabbles, I think we should be very
careful as regards “unity”. Upon my word, we should be not uniting
now, but dissociating! If a publisher can be found for a journal or a newspaper,
you should conclude an agreement with him off your own bat (or
take money from him without an agreement, if possible), but the arrangement of
a meeting will only make a mess. Truly, the result will be a mess.


I am writing to you because I do not want to see you of all people
wasting your time, nervous energy, etc , on a mess. I know from my own
bitter experience of 1908-11 that it is impossible to “unite”
now. In our Mysl, for example, Plekhanov more than once
behaved temperamentally—he was dissatisfied, for example, with my article
on strikes and on
Potresov,[1]

 saying that I was abusing “him”! We managed
to smooth things over and for the time being we can and must work with
Plekhanov, but formal unions and meetings are premature and could spoil
everything.


Don’t hurry with the meeting!


It is said positively among us that there exists a government oircular of
Stolypin’s for closing down all Social-Democratic
publications. It sounds like the truth Before the Fourth Duma they will probably
put the screw on ten times tighter.


Legal opportunities will evidently diminish in the immediate future. We must
push on with illegal work.


M. F. wrote that you have completely withdrawn from Znaniye. That means a
complete break with Pyatnitsky and my last letter came too late?


All the best.


Yours,


Lenin


P. S. Sovremennaya
Zhizn[2] in Baku has also been

Paris, November 1, 1911


Dear Comrade,


You will be doing me a great service if you can help me with advice and action
in the following matter. A number of organisations of our Party intend to call a
conference (abroad—of course). The number of members of the conference will be about 20-25. Is there a possibility of organising this conference in
Prague (to last about a
week)?[2]


The most important thing for us is the possibility of organising it in
extreme secrecy. No person, no organisation, should know about it. (It is a
Social-Democratic conference, hence legal according to European laws,
but the majority of the delegates do not have passports and cannot use
their own names.)


I earnestly beg you, dear comrade, if it is at all possible, to help us and tell
me as quickly as possible the address of a comrade in Prague who (in the event
of an affirmative reply) could make all the practical arrangements. It would be
best if this comrade understood Russian—if this is impossible we can also
reach agreement with him in German.


I hope, dear comrade, that you will pardon me for troubling you with this
request. I send you my thanks in anticipation.


With Party greetings. N. Lenin


My address is:


VI. Oulianoff


4, Rue Marie Rose, 4,


Paris, XIV.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
N\uemec, Antonin (1858–1926)—a Right Social-Democrat. From 1897
virtual leader of the Czech Social-Democrats, whom he represented in the
Second International. In 1906–18 Social-Democratic deputy to the Vienna
Imperial Council; in 1918–25 deputy to the National Assembly of the
Czechoslovak Republic.





[2]
This refers to arrangements for the Sixth All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P., which was held in Prague on January 5–17 (18–30), 1912.


The Czech Social-Democrats rendered great help in organising this
Conference. They not only gave the premises for the Conference, but
provided accommodation for the delegates in the homes of Czech workers and
generally took care of the delegates. The building in which the Prague
Conference was held (7, Gibern St.) is now a Lenin Museum.
