Dear A. M.,

We shall shortly send you the resolutions of the
Conference.[1] We have finally succeeded—in spite of the
liquidationist[2] scoundrels—in reviving the Party and its Central
Committee. I hope you will be as glad of this as we are.

Won’t you write a May Day leaflet for us? Or a little
leaflet in a similar May Day spirit? Quite a short one, a
“heart-warmer”, what do you say? Think of old times,
remember 1905, and put down a couple of words, if you
have the mind to write. There are two or three illegal
printing-presses in Russia, and the Central Committee will
republish it, probably, in several tens of thousands of copies.
It would be a good thing to gel a revolutionary manifesto
like the Tales in
Zvezda.[3] T am very, very glad that you are
helping Zvezda. We are having a devilish hard job with
it—internal and external and financial difficulties are
immense—but still we are managing so far.

All the best,
 >Lenin

P.S.  And
Sovremennik[4] has had the sense to die, after
all! That was a good deed on its part.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the resolutions passed by the Sixth (Prague)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. of 1912. The resolutions and
“Announcement” concerning the Conference were published in
booklet form in Paris in February 1912 by the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P.





[2]
Liquidationism—an opportunist trend in the R.S.D.L.P. that
emerged in the period of reaction following the defeat of the 1905–
07 revolution. The liquidators demanded liquidation of the illegal
revolutionary party of the working class and tried to subordinate
the working-class movement to bourgeois interests. The Sixth
(Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. expelled the
liquidators from the Party.





[3]
Zvezda (The Star)—legal Bolshevik newspaper (December 1910–
May 5, 1912). In 1911 and 1912 it published seven stories by Gorky
from his Tales of Italy series.





[4]
Sovremennik (The Contemporary)—literary and political monthly
published in St. Petersburg from 1911 to 1915. It was a rallying
point for Menshevik liquidators, Socialist-Revolutionaries,
Popular Socialists and Left-wing liberals.

Dear A. M.,

I am very glad you have agreed to try and write a May
Day leaflet.

I enclose the Conference resolutions.

I have seen Zhivoye
Dyelo.[1] A rotten little liquidationist
rag with an “approach”. Liberal propaganda. They are
glad that the police prevent the question of the Party being
openly discussed.

Zvezda will continue, either as a weekly or as a kopek
daily.[2] You helped Zvezda very, very much with your
splendid Tales, and that made me extremely joyful, so that
the joy—if I am to talk straight—outweighed my sadness
at your “affair” with the Chernovs and
Amfiteatrovs[3]....
Brr! I am glad, I must confess, that they are “going up
the spout”.

But as for your having nothing to live on and not being
able to get printed anywhere, that’s bad. You ought to
have got rid of that leech Pyatnitsky long ago and
appointed an honest agent, an agent pure and simple, to deal with
Znaniye[4] (perhaps it’s already too late, I don’t know)!!!
If only.... It would have been a gold mine....

I see Rozhkov’s Irkutskoye
Slovo[5] very rarely. The man’s
become a liquidator. And Chuzhak is an old ass, hardened
and pretentious.

Yours,
 Lenin

Thank
M. F.[6] for her letter to Moscow, and a thousand
greetings!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Zhivoye Dyelo (Vital Cause)—Menshevik liquidationist legal
weekly, published in St. Petersburg from January to April 1912.
Sixteen issues appeared. Its contributors included L. Martov,
F. Dan and P. Axelrod.





[2]
The daily newspaper for the workers that succeeded Zvezda was
Pravda (Truth), the first issue of which appeared on May 5, 1912.





[3]
Reference is to Gorky’s work for the magazine Zavety (Behests),
to which V. Chernov, a Socialist-Revolutionary leader, contributed,

__PRINTERS_P_563_COMMENT__
36*

   

and for the magazine Sovremennik, which in 1911 was run by
A. Amfiteatrov.





[4]
Znaniye (Knowledge)—a book-publishing firm founded in St. 
Petersburg in 1898 by a group of writers. Gorky joined the firm
later and virtually became its leading spirit. The managing
director was K. P. Pyatnitsky.





[5]
Irkutskoye Slovo (Irkutsk Word)—weekly newspaper with a
Menshevik-liquidationist orientation (1911–12). =

Its publisher, Rozhkov,
a member of the R.S.D.L.P. since 1905, had in the years of
reaction become one of the ideologists of liquidationism; N. 
Chuzhak (N. F. Nasimovich) was a literary critic.

Dear Comrade,

I hasten to reply to some of your questions. A report
on the Conference is a necessary and most important thing.
I hope that, once you have taken it on, you will go round
all Switzerland, and not only the two
cities.[2]

“From the Announcement I cannot make out what steps
the Conference took to draw in various trends abroad and
national organisations.” These are your words.

But the Announcement stated clearly and precisely that
the Vperyod
group[3] + Trotsky +
Plekhanov[4] were invited,
and the nationals three times. What more was needed?

Lunacharsky at Zinoviev’s lecture in Paris had the brass
face to say that it was a
“Gaunerkniff”,[1]

because, he said,
the invitations were sent out not by the Conference but
by delegates who had arrived. Well, isn’t this Lunacharsky
a scoundrel? 23 sessions = 12 days: if the invitations hadn’t
been sent out beforehand, the people who were invited would
have missed half (letter has to be sent off, secret addresses
given, then they have to arrive—just add it all up!). And
from Trotsky’s letter you can see that the invitation was
from 7 people = 1/2 of the total of 14.

I was against the invitation, but the delegates invited
the Vperyod group and Trotsky and Plekhanov.

The chairman of the credentials committee was the 
delegate from Kiev (a Menshevik). Even Trotsky has admitted
(under pressure!) that this is a bona fide organisation.

Whom will the worker believe, then? The Kiev 
organisation or ranters abroad?

Don’t believe rumours. Neither the Plekhanovites nor
the Vperyod people, no one left the Conference. There were
in all two pro-Party Mensheviks. The one from Kiev

    

behaved with extreme correctness and on the whole went with
us. The one from Ekaterinoslav behaved with extreme
obstructiveness, but even he did not leave the Conference
and only moved “protests” in the spirit of Plekhanov.

The Ekaterinoslav delegate moved his own draft
resolution on the constitution of the Conference, in which he
fully admitted that everyone had been notified, protested
that some had not come, but wanted the Conference to
constitute itself as representing Russian organisations.
He remained on this in a minority of one.

Now 12 delegates are in Russia, making reports
everywhere. There are already letters about this from St. 
Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Samara, Nikolayev and Tiflis. The
work has begun and will continue.

The
Bund[5] + the Letts are trying to fix up a conference
with the liquidators. Let them try! It’s deeds that are
needed, gentlemen, and not words!! You have been
impotent (+ Trotsky + Vperyodists) since November 26,
1910[6]
—when Trotsky proclaimed the calling of a conference—
and you will remain impotent.

We have broken with the liquidators, the Party has
broken with them. Let someone try to set up a different
R.S.D.L.P. with the liquidators! It would be laughable.

The Duma Social-Democratic group is directly neither
for us nor for them. But
(1) there were two deputies at
our
Conference[7];
(2) Zvezda has nine Social-Democratic
deputies on its list of contributors, while the liquidationist
Zhivoye Dyelo has four. There are facts for you!

Among the Letts the Bolsheviks have declared war on
their Central Committee.

Well, I wish you every success! Greetings to all our
friends.

Yours,
 N. Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]

 “Swindler’s trick”.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin refers to reports on the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference
of the R.S.D.L.P. (January 1912). G. L. Shklovsky made reports
on the Conference in Berne and Lausanne, but his tour of all
Switzerland did not take place.





[3]
Vperyod group—an anti-Party group of otzovists, ultimatumists
and god-builders (see Notes 73 and 77); was organised in December
1909 on the initiative of A. Bogdanov and G. Alexinsky. It had its
own organ called Vperyod (Forward). Lacking the support of the
workers, the group had virtually collapsed by 1913. Its complete
and formal dissolution occurred in 1917, after the February
bourgeois-democratic revolution.





[4]
Trotsky (Bronstein), L. D. (1879–1940)—joined the R.S.D.L.P.
in 1897, became a Menshevik. During the years of reaction (1907–
10) and the subsequent revolutionary revival, though ostensibly
an advocate of “non-factionalism”, he in fact adopted the position
of the liquidators. In 1912 he was the organiser of the anti-Party
August bloc. During the First World War he took up a Centrist
stand. Returning from emigration after the February
bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917, he joined the Inter-District
Organisation and together with its other members was admitted to the
Bolshevik Party at the Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.).
After the October Socialist Revolution Trotsky held a number of
government posts. In 1918 he was opposed to the Brest Peace
Treaty, in 1920–21 he led the opposition in the discussion on the
trade unions, and from 1923 conducted a bitter factional struggle
against the Party’s general line, against Lenin’s programme of
building socialism, and preached the impossibility of the victory
of socialism in the U.S.S.R. In 1927 Trotsky was expelled from
the Party. For anti-Soviet activities he was deported from the
U.S.S.R. in 1929, and in 1932 deprived of Soviet citizenship.

Plekhanov, G. V. (1850–1918)—outstanding figure in the
Russian and international working-class movement, the first
propagandist of Marxism in Russia. In 1883 he set up in Geneva the

   

first Russian Marxist organisation, the Emancipation of Labour
group. An opponent of Narodism, Plekhanov also opposed
revisionism in the international working-class movement. He wrote
a number of works that played a big part in defending and
propagating materialist philosophy. After the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. (1903) Plekhanov took up a position of reconciliation
with opportunism and later joined the Mensheviks. In the years
of reaction (1907–10) and during the subsequent revolutionary
revival Plekhanov came out against the Machist revision of Marxism
and against liquidationism. During the First World War he became
a social-chauvinist. After the February bourgeois-democratic
revolution he returned to Russia from emigration, and opposed the
Bolsheviks and the socialist revolution on the grounds that Russia
was not ripe for socialism. When the October Socialist Revolution
occurred, his attitude to it was negative, but he took no part in
the struggle against Soviet power.





[5]
Bund (General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland and
Russia) was organised in 1897; it spread nationalism and separatism
in the working-class movement in Russia. It disbanded in March
1921.





[6]
Lenin has in mind the resolution of November 26, 1910, passed at
a meeting of the so-called Party Social-Democratic Club in Vienna
(mainly composed of Trotskyists) and aimed against Rabochaya
Gazeta (Workers’ Gazette) (see Note 29).





[7]
The delegates whom the Social-Democratic group in the Third
Duma sent to the Prague Party Conference were N. G. Poletayev
and V. Y. Shurkanov (the latter was subsequently exposed as an
agent provocateur). They arrived late at the Conference. Lenin met
them in Leipzig.

Dear Comrade,

Nadya sent you my little note
today.[1]

I hasten to let
you know—so that there should be no misunderstanding
and you should not make any mistake in your report—
that yesterday there was a meeting in Paris of “
Social-Democrats” who were enemies of the Conference. They all
(the Plekhanovites and the Golos
group,[3] the Vperyod
group and the conciliators, and tutti
quanti[2]

)

adopted
a resolution of protest against the Conference, and also
something about excluding me from the International
Socialist
Bureau[4] (this is from hearsay, because, of course, the
Bolsheviks and the supporters of the
Conference[5] did not
attend the meeting).

Naturally, all this is laughable. If these gentry proved
unable to retain their grip even on the C.C. Bureau Abroad
(make fun of it in your report, using Plekhanov’s funeral
oration in No. 15 of this Dnevnik,
Supplement 2![6]), now
they will be even less able to set up anything. Well, kind
friends, not words but deeds: you boast that you have united.
Do please unite in Nasha Zarya and Zhivoye Dyelo, and
above all in Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata.[7]

Comedians!

All the best, and best wishes for success.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

[2]
The like.—Ed.
 



[3]
Golos group—Mensheviks associated with the liquidators’ paper
Golos Sotsial-Demokrata (Voice of the Social-Democrat) published
first in Geneva and then in Paris.





[4]
International Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.)—permanent executive and
information body of the Second International. The decision to set
up the Bureau was taken at the Paris Congress of the Second
International in 1900. From 1905 to 1912 Lenin represented the
R.S.D.L.P. in the Bureau. With the outbreak of the world war
the I.S.B. became an obedient tool in the hands of the
social-chauvinists.





[5]
In Paris, on March 12, 1912, a meeting of representatives of the
Bund Committee Abroad, the Vperyod group, Golos Sotsial–
Demokrata, Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda, the pro-Party Mensheviks
and the conciliators passed a slanderous anti-Party resolution
aimed against the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. and its decisions. As representative of the C.C. of
the R.S.D.L.P. in the International Socialist Bureau, Lenin wrote

   

two letters concerning this resolution to the Bureau Secretary
Camille Huysmans (see present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 547–50, and
this volume, pp. 31–32).





[6]
Reference is to Plekhanov’s article “Vechnaya Pamyat” (Eternal
Memory) published in Supplement 2 to No. 15 of Dnevnik
Sotsial-Demokrata (Diary of a Social-Democrat), which Plekhanov brought
out at intervals between March 1905 and April 1912 in Geneva.
Sixteen numbers were issued. Publication was resumed in 1916
in Petrograd, but only one issue appeared.





[7]
Nasha Zarya (Our Dawn), =

Zhivoye Dyelo (Vital Cause) and =

Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata (Voice of the Social-Democrat) were organs of
the Menshevik liquidators.

March 28, 1912

Dear Friends,

I am terribly upset and disturbed by the complete
disorganisation of our (and your) relations and contacts. Truly,
it is enough to make one despair! Instead of letters, you
send various telegraphically brief exclamations which are
quite incomprehensible.

(1) Nothing from Ivanovich. What is he doing? Where
is he? How is he getting on? It’s devilishly necessary to
have someone legal in Petersburg or near Petersburg, because
things are bad there. This is a furious and difficult war.
We have neither information nor guidance, nor
supervision of the paper.

(2) Not one of the Conference delegates gives us any
contacts. Not one, and not a single contact. Why, that’s
complete collapse!

(3) No resolutions from anywhere which are sensible,
clear, stating what organisations adopted them, supporting
the decisions, confirming that their delegate attended, came
back, reported!! Is it really not clear how different such
formal resolutions are from letters of an intimate character:
“decent”, “jolly good”, “we won”, etc.? There are no
resolutions from Kiev or from Savka’s
town.[2] Nikolai has
sent in a letter full of joyful exclamations but absolutely

    

senseless. It is quite unsuitable either for the press or for
official use. Were all the resolutions read out? Were they
approved? What is the text of resolutions on the Conference?
Are they joining forces with the local liquidators? Not
one (not one!) of these fundamental elementary questions
is answered. Not a single word of communication with
that town (most important!) has been transmitted to us.
Is not that collapse? Isn’t that a parody of work?

(4) No resolutions from anywhere, not a single one,
demanding the money! Simply a disgrace.

(5) Neither from Tiflis nor from Baku (terribly important
centres) is there any word of sense about reports having
been delivered. Where are the resolutions? Shame and
disgrace!

(6) Not a single reprinting from anywhere of the
Announcement or even part of it, either in print or hectographed!
A disgrace.

(7) No precise reply in writing about the platform either.
Will it be published? When? Has it been approved
completely? We have to print it in the Central Organ, but
have no precise information.

(8) They will have to go round all the organisations
again and everywhere get resolutions adopted which are
precise, formal, detailed, sensible, clear
(a) on
representation at the Conference and on its substance,
(b) on
support for the Central Committee,
(c) and against the
liquidators, specifically against the local ones, and in general,
and
(d) demanding return of the money.

(9) About the money, things are bad, send us a
resolution which gives us the right to bring an action. The
Germans have sent a refusal. Unless it is taken to court, we
shall have a complete breakdown in three or four months.

(10) If you have no financial resources, the budget must
immediately be radically reviewed: we have gone beyond
all limits, and are approaching bankruptcy.

(11)  In
Vorwärts[3] of March 26, there was a furious and
malicious article against the Conference, from the editorial
board. Clearly this is Trotsky. There is a great battle over
the Conference—but Russia is silent. It is no use putting
on a bold show and boasting; everyone knows about Vorwärts
and the protests, but nothing comes from Russia.
 

Summing up: this is collapse and disorganisation. A
round of visits and contacts. Precise correspondence.
Reprinting of the Announcement, even by hectograph.
Otherwise it’s all boasting.

Lenin

Pass on the letter to S.  for further transmission.
Greetings.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Novoye Vremya (New Times)—daily newspaper published in St. 
Petersburg from 1868 to 1917. At first moderate-liberal in tone, it
became an organ of reactionary aristrocratic =

circles and
officialdom after it was taken over by A. S. Suvorin in 1876. From 1905
onwards it was an organ of the Black Hundreds. It was closed down
by the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet
on October 26 (November 8), 1917.





[2]
Savka’s town—Ekaterinoslav, where Y. D. Zevin, who used the
pseudonym “Savka”, was working.





[3]
Vorwärts (Forward)—daily newspaper, central organ of the
German Social-Democratic Party, started in Berlin in 1891. In the
late nineties, after the death of Engels, the editorship of the paper
fell into the hands of the Party’s Right wing and regularly
published articles by opportunists.

In the issue for March 26, 1912, Vorwärts carried an anonymous
slanderous article written by Trotsky against the Sixth (Prague)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. and its decisions. The
German opportunists on Vorwärts refused to publish Lenin’s reply
to Trotsky. In order to give the German workers a true picture of
the Prague Conference, Sotsial-Demokrat printed Lenin’s reply in
German and published it as a separate pamphlet Der Anonymus
aus dem “Vorwärts” and die Sachlage in der Sozialdemokratischen
Arbeiterpartei Russlands (The Anonymous Writer in “Vorwärts” and
the State of Affairs in the R.S.D.L.P.).

The pamphlet was sent out to 600 German addresses—
editorial boards of Social-Democratic publications, local committees,
and libraries.

 Readers will note that each volume of this PDF editions presented and linked below contains a copyright notice by David J. Romagnolo, the editor and publisher of the Marx2Mao website (www.marx2mao.com), who scanned and created this superb series of facsimiles. [Web viewing versions in HTML are presented and linked on the right]
David claimed a copyright on the presentation (not the content) of these digital incarnations of Lenin's works, but admitted himself that he isn't sure whether such a claim has legal standing.  In fact, he is right to express doubt about this.  The law and court precedent is quite unambiguously clear here:  "slavish reproductions" of public domain works (such as the collected works of Lenin)... whether they be photographic bit map scans, or the meticulously re-type-set digital files David produced...  CAN NOT be claimed to be owned by anyone.  
As always, we at Marxists Internet Archive encourage the widest possible distribution and sharing of the materials we archive, but, while we share Dave's wish this material be distributed freely, and without charge, the fact is that under the existing bourgeois intellectual property law neither David, nor we, nor anyone else, actually, have the legal right to restrict how this material is used or re-distributed. 
We thank David J. Romagnolo for his years of work meticulously re-creating a stunningly high resolution, re-type-set digital archive of Lenin's Collected Works  – making this was an outstanding service to the workers movement – and we encourage users to remember to credit David J. Romagnolo and www.marx2mao.com when reproducing or using these files.

Dear Comrade Huysmans,

I thank you for sending me the Paris
“resolution”.[2]

As I have already written to you, the Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. condemned the liquidators and various groups
abroad[3] which are introducing disorganisation into our
Party and represent nothing in Russia. On the one hand,
in Paris at the present time it is groups of this kind that
have voted for the above-mentioned resolution. An old
custom has it that all condemned persons have the right
to inveigh against their judges for 24 hours. The persons
who have signed the resolution have made excessive use of
this right, and perhaps even abused it.

On the other hand, there are groups who were invited
to the Conference but refused to take part in it. Now they
are “protesting” and attempting to call another conference,
appealing to the gods to witness that they stand for unity.
A very original way to get unity! We shall see whether they
will make any headway in Russia. It is just as difficult to
carry out anything real in Russia as it is easy to vote for
abusive resolutions in Paris. And, of course, Paris, Vienna,
etc., do not possess the right to speak in the name of Russia.

In any case, the persons who signed the Paris resolution
are in too much of a hurry when they begin to talk about
a “split”. In order to establish that a split exists, it must
be established that there exist at least two Central
Committees in Russia. So far this is not so.

As for Citizen Plekhanov, the C.C. informed him more
than a month ago of the Conference resolutions. He has not

    

vouchsafed a reply. Consequently, at the present time I am
quite ignorant of whether Citizen Plekhanov has (and from
which C.C.) any powers as a member of the International
Socialist Bureau.

If you, dear comrade, are luckier than I, i.e., if you
get any reply from Citizen Plekhanov, I hope you will be
good enough to inform me.

With fraternal greetings, 

Yours to command,
 N. Lenin

Don’t be light-hearted about the campaign of the
liquidators abroad. It is a great mistake when people simply
dismiss what goes on abroad with a wave of the hand and
“send it to hell”. The liquidators will cause a lot of
confusion if they call their conference with the Bund + the
Caucasian Regional
Committee[2] + the Letts +
liquidationist intellectuals. And they will call it! We must fight
stubbornly, seriously and systematically. There must be
a round tour and explanation everywhere of the liquidators’
deception. Reprint the long article in the last issue of
Rabochaya
Gazeta[3] as a leaflet. I advise you to print a
number of leaflets immediately (all the important resolutions of
the Conference are a must). With leaflets you will win
everything. Be exceptionally careful in setting about
Izvestia.[4]
The paper will be a great pretext for the police. And it is
more important than anything else to hold on until the
elections. Remember that there are no replacements.

April 16, 1912

Dear Friends 

For God’s sake give us more contacts. Contacts, contacts,
contacts, that’s what we haven’t got. Without this
everything is unstable. Remember that two have already left
the scene, there are no replacements for them. Without
contacts everything will fall to pieces alter one or two
further arrests. You must without fail set up regional
committees (or simply groups of trusted agents), linked up
with us, for every region. Without this everything is shaky.
As regards publication, you should press on with reprinting
the entire resolution about the
elections,[3] to make it
everywhere available in full and among the masses.

As regards the money, it is time to stop being naive
about the Germans. Trotsky is now in full command there,
and carrying on a furious struggle. You must send us a
mandate to take the matter to the courts, otherwise we
shall get nothing. We have already sent the May Day
leaflet everywhere. I advise you to publish the appeal to the
peasants about the elections as a leaflet (from Rabochaya
Gazeta: the peasantry and the
elections).[2]

Make sure of
republishing the long article from Rabochaya Gazeta. This is
an essential supplement to the platform, in which a very

    

important paragraph about socialism has been omitted.
Write! Contacts, contacts. Greetings.




P.S. Vorwärts is printing the most brazen lies, as, for
example, that all Russia has already declared in favour of
the Bundist-Lettish conference. It’s Trotsky and Co. who
are writing, and the Germans believe them. Altogether,
Trotsky is boss in Vorwärts. The foreign department is
controlled by Hilferding, Trotsky’s friend.

Dear Colleague,

I am sending new material today for the Voter’s Handbook.
This is nearly all, there will be another article or two from
here in two days’ time, and then you will get an article
on the budget from Tver.

(1) I very much advise you also to reprint from Zvezda
No. 34 (December 17, 1911) the article by Frey: “The Role
of Worker Electors in the Election Campaign” (it would
also be a good thing to reprint his article in No. 36,
December 31, 1911, about the role of peasant
electors,[1]

as well).
Don’t go out of your way to cut them down. It is better to
publish in full a substantial article which will be of value
in giving intelligible guidance for the elections. Don’t go
out of your way for cheapness and brevity—better publish
something solid.

If, after all, it is absolutely impossible to publish all
the articles, be certain to return those you don’t.

(2) Here it is most essential to make arrangements for
regular correspondence. Let your secretary write to me
direct here, and not through Arcachon, to avoid any delay.
Give us a better address for letters to you.

(3) You are wrong not to reply to the liquidators. This
is a great mistake. You can and should reply, without
saying a word about the Conference. You should print a
brief reply to every lie of Zhivoye Dyelo: Zhivoye Dyelo
in such-and-such a number is lying, as all the liquidators
do. It is essential to reply, otherwise you lose.
 

(4) If Plekhanov writes, you should send his articles
here in proofs. Otherwise it becomes a “privilege” for him,
which we cannot tolerate. Be careful. You will force us to
leave if Plekhanov is given the privilege of writing against
the Conference when we cannot write in favour of it. It
would be a mean trick to allow him to abuse it when we
cannot praise it.

(5) Be sure to send us in a separate packet, wrapped up
in Novoye
Vremya,[2] these numbers of Zvezda: Nos. 24
and 25 of the summer of 1911, No. 18 (54), No. 19 (55),
No. 22 (58), No. 23 (59)—we haven’t got them—and 
Zhivoye Dyelo No. 11 and No. 12. Please send us confiscated
issues separately, wrapping them up in newspapers of the
Right.

(6) Let us know as soon as possible about the daily
paper.[3] What will be the size? What length of article
can be sent?

(7) Try and buy as cheaply as possible the Verbatim
Reports of the Third Duma, especially the sessions of
1911–12. Write.

June 6, 1912 
 

Dear Colleague,

It is terribly annoying that my first letter to you about
the book (thank you very much for sending it) has been
lost. It is an incredible—but with us, it turns out, a
possible—fact that a letter of a purely scientific nature can be
lost. I will try and repeat it from memory, because I did
not take a copy.

I read your
book[1]

with great pleasure, and was very glad
to see that you had taken up a serious and large-scale work.
This work will certainly enable you to test, deepen and
consolidate your Marxist convictions.

I will note some ideas which came into my mind when
reading it. It seemed to me that here and there, when
studying the results of “differentiation”, departures from the
countryside are overlooked. I will make clear what I mean
by this example,
(a) first aspect: out of 100 households 25
have no horse = 25 per cent, or have no sowings;
(b) second
aspect: of 150 households 36 have no sowings = 24 per cent.
Diminished differentiation, it, would seem? But if 30
households or families have left the village for the town, or
migrated, etc., then in fact proletarisation has increased.
I think this is a typical example. The statistics always
consider the households in existence, remaining “narrowly
statistical” and omitting what is sometimes most important.
 

Then, the author definitely and more than once confines
the subject of his research to the tillage aspect. But in
his conclusions he imperceptibly extends the theme,
speaking of the whole of agriculture and sometimes even of the
whole economy. This leads to error, because some aspects
of “differentiation”, i.e., of the proletarisation of the
peasants and the genesis of capital, are, as a consequence,
lost (for example, commercial stock-breeding in Yaroslavl
Gubernia and other forms of penetration of exchange into
agriculture, as it becomes specialised).

Furthermore. Do not the rows of figures sometimes
obscure the types, socio-economic types of farmers (
substantial bourgeois farmer; middle farmer; semi-proletarian;
proletarian)? This danger is very great because of the
qualities of statistical material. The “rows of figures” carry
one away. I would advise the author to take this danger
into account: our “socialists of the chair” unquestionably
in this way throttle the living Marxist content of data.
They drown the class struggle in rows and rows of figures.
This does not occur with the author, but in the big work
he has undertaken he ought particularly to take account
of this danger, this “line” of the socialists of the chair,
the liberals and the Narodniks. He should take it into
account and trim it down, of course.

Lastly,
Maslov[4] has appeared as something like a deus
ex machina. Cur? Quomodo? Quibus
auxiliis?[2]

After all,
his theory is very remote from Marxism. The Narodniks
rightly called him a “critic” (=opportunist). Perhaps the
author took him on trust more by chance?

Such were my thoughts when reading your interesting
and serious book. I shake you by the hand, and wish you
success in your work. I take this opportunity to send warm
greetings to the whole family, and particularly to the
“water-carrying
nags”[5]—do you remember?

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

Maslov, P. P. (1867–1946)—economist, Social-Democrat, wrote a

The expression recalls the summer of 1907, when Lenin for
conspiratorial purposes and to restore his health was living at
Knipovich’s country house in Stjernsund (Finland). To get water for
their flowers the Knipovich family had to pull a water-cart from
a well that was situated a long way from the garden. When he saw
members of the family setting out for water, Lenin came out of
the house and helped them pull the cart.

Dear Colleague,

I send you one more article by I. Gylka. The author
reminds you that he is expecting an advance.

It is urgently necessary to reply to him immediately
(you can do it through me, but without fail on a separate
sheet). The author lives in Lemberg, makes a special study
of his subject, and such a contributor should be drawn in.
Once again I advise you to pay him an advance, and in any
case to reply to him at once.

N.B. If Gylka’s articles are not accepted, return them
at once without fail!

We have received the parcel, and cannot help
complaining.

Of the books, only one! Write and say why. Did other
members of the staff take the rest of the books received?
Have they taken them for long, or for good? If so, you
ought to arrange to send them to us for a time. We repeat
that without books we cannot work.

The office should be more careful about this.

We received the Voter’s Handbook two and a half weeks
after publication! Yet to send it at once would have cost
5 kopeks....

There has been a delay with the papers, after all. We
are stuck here without newspapers, and we shall be without
them for another two or three days.

I would very much advise you to send a reporter to the
City Council, find out how many
applications[1]

they are
getting from tenants and set about publishing this 
systematically (encouraging successful districts and appealing
to the unsuccessful). Very little time is left, and the paper
should make itself responsible for the whole business.
 

You should get from the City Council, through any
statisticians among your acquaintances (or officially from the
editors and the members of the State Duma), all the
statistical material (if they don’t exist, then buy
Rech[3] for
those years and months, or some other paper) about the
elections to the First, Second and Third State Duma +
Petersburg statistics (housing, population, etc.). With such
material in your hands, and with an intelligent reporter
visiting the City Council daily or 2–3 times a week, you
can run a good section in the paper about the course of the
elections.

Do you send Pravda to the Wiener
Arbeiter-Zeitung[4]
in Vienna? Send it, and send it to us as well by wrapper.

I advise you to reply to Trotsky through the post: “To
Trotsky (Vienna). We shall not reply to disruptive and
slanderous letters.”
Trotsky’s dirty campaign against 
Pravda is one mass of lies and slander. The well-known Marxist
and follower of Plekhanov, Rothstein (London), has
written to us that he received Trotsky’s slanders and replied
to him: I cannot complain of the Petersburg Pravda in
any way. But this intriguer and liquidator goes on lying,
right and left.

Yours faithfully,
 V. Ulyanov

P.S. It would be still better to reply in this way to Trotsky
through the post: “To Trotsky (Vienna). You are wasting
your time sending us disruptive and slanderous letters.
They will not be replied to.”
 

Notes

[2]
Pravda (Truth)–the first legal mass workers’ daily in Russia.
The first issue appeared in St. Petersburg on May 5, 1912.

Pravda played a key role in the history of the Bolshevik Party
and the revolution. It was a collective propagandist, agitator and
organiser in the struggle to put the Party’s policy into practice.
As a centre of the campaign for Party principles, it fought
resolutely against the Menshevik liquidators, otzovists and Trotskyists
and opposed international opportunism. Pravda helped to build a
firm foundation for a mass Bolshevik party.

Lenin guided the policy of Pravda, which published 270 of his
articles. The paper was closed down eight times by the tsarist
government but continued to appear under fresh names: 
Rabochaya Pravda (Workers’ Truth), =

Severnaya Pravda (Northern Truth), =

Pravda Truda (Truth of Labour), =

Za Pravdu (For Truth), =

Proletarskaya Pravda (Proletarian Truth), =

Put Pravdy (Path of Truth), =

Rabochy (The Worker), =

and Trudovaya Pravda (Labour Truth).
Before the outbreak of the First World War, on July 21, 1914, the
paper was banned and did not recommence publication until after
the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917.

On March 18, 1917, Pravda began appearing as the organ of the
Central and Petrograd Committees of the R.S.D.L.P. On April 18,
upon his return from abroad, Lenin joined the editorial board and
became its leading spirit. Between July and October 1917, the
paper was persecuted by the bourgeois Provisional Government
and had frequently to change its name, appearing as Listok Pravdy
(Pravda’s News Sheet), =

Proletary (The Proletarian), =

Rabochy (The
Worker), and =

Rabochy Put (Workers’ Path). After the victory of
the October Socialist Revolution, on November 9, 1917, the
Party’s central organ began appearing under its original name 
Pravda.

Rech (Speech)—daily newspaper, central organ of the
Constitutional-Democratic Party; appeared in St. Petersburg from

newspaper, central organ of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party,
founded by Victor Adler in Vienna in 1889. Banned in 1934, it

Party of Austria.

Dear Colleague,

I have received your long letter, and I see that you and
T must most certainly have it out.

First of all, a detail. You won’t find correspondents
at two kopeks a line. So long as you have no money, you
will have to make do with our articles about affairs abroad.

Now for the main thing. You complain of monotony.
But this will always be the case if you don’t print polemics—
if, in particular, you cut down Kamenev (he writes in a
different tone)—if you reduce everything to “positive
liquidationism”. And in addition you will lose all your
contributors if you don’t print them, and don’t even reply
and don’t send back articles (for example, mine: the reply
to Blank—important! “Unquenchable
Hopes”[2] and a
number of others!!).

Just look at Nevsky Golos: it’s more lively. It is not
afraid of polemics. It attacks. It boldly makes its point
to the bitter end.

By avoiding “painful questions”, Zvezda and Pravda
make themselves dry and monotonous, uninteresting,
uncombative organs. A socialist paper must carry on polemics:
our times are times of desperate confusion, and we can’t
do without polemics. The question is whether they are
to be carried on in a lively way, attacking, putting forward
questions independently, or only on the defensive, in dry
and boring fashion.
 

For example, the “Supporter of Zvezda” in No. 16 gave
a good reply. Clearly he is a man of principle. But all the
same he did not dissipate the terrible fears aroused 
everywhere (I have a series of letters) by No. 6 of Nevsky
Golos.[3]
What did happen, after all? Was there a conference? Called
by whom? What for? None of this is clear! And until this
is cleared up no one wants to work. Everyone is saying:
haven’t I the right to know who I am working for, whom
I am helping to get elected to the Duma? Maybe it’s a
liquidator? Maybe it’s some muddled Trotskyist
conciliator? Perhaps I am taking part (indirectly) in drawing up
a “common platform”??

Such questions paralyse energy and introduce
demoralisation.

Meanwhile Nevsky Golos is attacking briskly and takes a
more challenging line. You can’t hide differences from
the workers (as Pravda is doing): it’s harmful, fatal,
ridiculous.
You can’t leave it to the adversary, to Nevsky Golos,
to open up discussion of differences. Pravda will perish
if it is only a “popular”, “positive” organ, that is
certain .

It would certainly be victorious if it were not afraid
of polemics, talked straight about the liquidators, became
lively through argument, by an article against
Axelrod,[4]
etc. Such articles as Axelrod’s attract: all the workers
hear about the differences and are attracted to Axelrod’s
open explanations, because he says things straight out a
hundred times more boldly than we do. All the workers
hear the talk about a united platform, all the leading
workers know Axelrod’s
article[5]—and if you are silent, you
have fallen behind! And the paper which falls behind is
lost. A paper must be a step ahead of everyone, and that goes
for both Nevskaya Zvezda and for Pravda. Side by side with
the two “positive” little articles, Pravda must provide
polemics—Kamenev’s literary note—a feature article
ridiculing the liquidators—and so forth. Monotony and lateness
are incompatible with the newspaper business. And Pravda
has in addition a special and exceptionally important duty:
“whom is it going to lead”—this
is what everyone is asking,
what everyone is trying to read between the lines. It would
be important to have a meeting (once in four years, before

    

the elections)—you can’t carry on the paper without even
infrequent meetings with your constant contributors. Think
over this well and quickly, for time won’t bear delay.

Best wishes,
 Ulyanov
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Nevskaya Zvezda (Neva Star)—legal Bolshevik newspaper
published in St. Petersburg from February to October 1912. Lenin
directed the paper’s policy from abroad. It was constantly
persecuted by the government. Of the 27 numbers that appeared 9 were
confiscated, and for 2 the editors were fined. The editors were
frequently prosecuted.





[2]
The articles Lenin mentions here, “Petty Artifices (A Reply to
Blank)” and “Unquenchable Hopes”, have not been discovered to
this day.





[3]
The liquidators’ paper Nevsky Golos (Neva Voice) No. 6, for July 
5, 1912, carried a report on meetings held in St. Petersburg by
representatives of various Social-Democratic trends (allegedly
including supporters of Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda) to discuss
the Fourth Duma election campaign. The editors of Nevskaya
Zvezda and Pravda denied any participation by their
representatives in these meetings.





[4]
Axelrod, P. B. (1850–1928)—a Menshevik leader. During the years
of reaction and the subsequent revolutionary revival, he was one
of the leaders of the liquidators and a member of the editorial
board of the Menshevik liquidators’ newspaper Golos Sotsial–
Demokrata. During the First World War he maintained a position of
social-chauvinism under cover of Centrist phrases. He was hostile
to the October Socialist Revolution.





[5]
The article Lenin refers to was “On Current Themes (From P. B.
Axelrod’s Letters to Friends)”, published in Nevsky Golos No. 6 on
July 5, 1912, and in Nasha Zarya No. 6 for 1912. Lenin criticises
the article in his work How P. B. Axelrod Exposes the Liquidators
(see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 175–86).

Dear Colleague,

I have received your letter about the “pressing matter”
and, I confess, read it with a sorrowful feeling. It shows
quite clearly that there is between us not enough of the
mutual understanding that in a “pressing matter”, as in
any serious matter, is most essential.

And the matter is really serious and—I agree with you—
pressing (not in the sense of a few days, of course). In order
to get mutual understanding on this, we ought to meet:
this would cost four or five days and 11 + 11 + 15 + 10 = 47
rubles all in all....

All that I can do at present to meet your request, I am
doing. I am sending you an article “On the Election
Platform”.[1] You will see clearly, I hope, what my views are
from this article.

As regards altering it, I must lay down special conditions
(usually I don’t make any, as you know, relying entirely
on a comradely, collective and not pettifogging attitude).
But on this occasion these special conditions are essential
for me, because the question is one of vast importance,
a radical question of principle.

I can agree only to
(1) eliminating the subhead and
(2)
minimum corrections for the censorship (only!!) in three or
four places, correction of individual words, and nothing
more at all.
If even then you can’t print it either in Pravda
or in Nevskaya Zvezda, return the article, I need it. To
eliminating mention of the liquidators I cannot agree.

The essence of the whole question is that the liquidators
are setting a trap: “let’s have an open platform” (while
privately the liquidator thinks: I will sign anything in

    

an open platform). And that is true, the liquidator will
sign anything in an open platform!! And it will be not a
platform, not a serious affair, but philistine chatter, a list
of “reforms”, a competition with the liberals on their own
ground, because every liberal (up to and including
Trubetskoi) will at present, six or eight weeks before the
elections, put his name to anything!! The liberals and the
liquidators will sign anything, if only they can get elected to
the Fourth Duma.

One must grasp the essence of the question, the principle
involved, and not be afraid of somewhat “unusual”, “
unsuitable” (for Pravda) expressions, polemics, etc. The
workers in their mass will understand very well the spirit of
the thing (“no cutting up”)—and that is the whole point.
All will understand why inventing open platforms in
Third-of-June Russia, six or eight weeks before the elections,
is ridiculous, stupid, philistine, even scoundrelly. And
that is the essence.

Such an article printed as a feature in Pravda, even in
small type, will at once take up a position, and kill the
adventurism of the inventors of open platforms. It will
kill the demagogy of their “say openly what you believe
in”. Used not Katkov in just the same way to ask: “Say
openly that you recognise the autocracy”?

Much has devolved on Pravda in the elections, and much
will be required of it. It would be a scandal if Pravda were
ridiculed from the left for drawing up open platforms.
Pravda has in practice the position of leader. That position
must be defended honourably. It should say clearly, calmly
and firmly: against the liquidators. And at once the whole
gang of these petty liberals will be killed. Let them put
forward their own list: they won’t dare, because they will
be completely disgraced!! I await a speedy reply.

With greetings,
 Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

Dear Colleague,

I have your letter, and the letter from Vitimsky. I was
very glad to get a word from him. But the contents of his
letter gave me great concern.

You write, and as
secretary,[1]

evidently, on behalf of
the editorial board, that “the editorial board in principle
considers my article fully acceptable including the attitude
to the liquidators”.
If that is so, why then does Pravda
stubbornly and systematically cut out any mention of the
liquidators, both in my articles and in the articles of other
colleagues?? Don’t you really know that they already have
their candidates? We know this for certain. We have had
official communications about this from a city in the
south,[2]

where there is a deputy from the worker curia. Undoubtedly
the same applies to other places.

The silence of Pravda is more than strange. You write:
“The editorial board considers it an obvious
misunderstanding” that it is being “suspected of striving to legalise the
demands contained in the platform”. But surely you will
agree that this is a fundamental question, one which
determines the whole spirit of the publication, and moreover
one which is inseparably bound up with the question of the
liquidators. I have not the slightest inclination for “
suspecting”; you know from experience that I show tremendous
patience with your corrections for reasons of censorship as
well. But a fundamental question requires a straight answer.

    

One must not leave a contributor uninformed as to whether
the editorial board intends to direct the section of the paper
dealing with the elections against the liquidators, naming
them clearly and precisely, or not against them. There is
not and cannot be any middle course.

If the article “must be printed anyway” (as the secretary
to the editorial board writes), then how am I to understand
Vitimsky’s “the angry tone is harmful”? Since when has
an angry tone against what is bad, harmful, untrue (and
the editorial board is “in principle” in agreement!) harmed
a daily newspaper?? On the contrary, colleagues, really and
truly on the contrary. To write without “anger” of what
is harmful means to write boringly. And you yourselves
refer, and justly so, to monotony!

Furthermore, I have not had any reply for a long time
concerning the article about November 9 (the reply of a
correspondent).[4] I repeat my request: return what cannot
pass the censorship or what you unquestionably reject.

We receive Pravda irregularly
(yesterday we didn’t get
it at all!!).
We have not seen Zvezda, either No. 14 or No. 17,
at all. A scandal! Can’t you send us the page proofs by
wrapper, rather than throw them away? That costs two
kopeks. It would save time. To send proofs to a contributor
is perfectly legitimate. When leaving at night, the night
editor would put the wrapper into a post-box—that would
be all. (But the wrappers often tear, they should be made
larger, the same size as the newspapers. It would be best
of all to use long narrow envelopes: in such envelopes—
unsealed—press material is more likely to arrive, and the
envelopes don’t cost much.) It is particularly essential
to have Zvezda No. 17.
Today is Thursday: two days’ delay!!

Finally, please let me know whether it would not be
possible to publish in one form or another (like Nevsky
Golos, which has more than once printed information about
the Social-Democrats abroad) the following news. The
German
Vorstand[3]

has made an appeal to the 11 (sic!)
Social-Democratic groups, factions and centres, suggesting a joint
conference on the subject of “unity”. The so-called “Lenin
trend” has replied with the most categorical refusal: what

    

can be more ridiculous and unworthy than this playing
at an agreement abroad with “centres and factions” which
have demonstrated their absolute impotence in Russia? No
negotiations with them, no agreements with the
liquidators—such was the reply of the so-called “Lenin trend”.
Whether anything has come of this arch-stupid idea of
Trotsky’s, and whether anything will come of it, is not
known.

And so I ask you to reply: can a report describing these
“Paris novelties”, and giving an assessment of them, be
published, in one form or another, in the newspaper you
edit? Do censorship conditions make this possible, or is
it quite
impossible?[5] (I ask only about the censorship
aspect of the case, since in principle—I venture to think on
the basis of the previous letter—the editorial board is not
in favour of unity with the liquidators, isn’t that so?)

With comradely greetings,
 V. Ulyanov

Cracow, August 1, 1912

Krakau, Oesterreich.
 Zwierzyniec. 218.
 Wl. Ulijanow

Dear A. M.,

I have received your letter and a letter from the
Siberians. My address now is not Paris, but Cracow—see above.

I haven’t quite understood what party you have decided
to expel me from. From the Socialist-Revolutionary perhaps?

No, joking apart, it’s a bad, philistine, bourgeois style
you have adopted, to wave us away with a “you’re all
squabblers”. Just have a look at the latest S.R. literature
—Pochin, Izvestia zagranichnoi oblastnoi organizatsii—
compare it with Revolutsionnaya Mysl and with 
Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya[2]—and then again with
Ropshin,[3] etc.
Remember
Vekhi[4] and the polemics (quasi-polemics)
conducted against it by Milyukov,
Gredeskul[5] (who has now
discovered that a second revolution in Russia is not
necessary), etc., etc.

Compare all this as a whole, the sum total of ideological
trends from 1908 to 1912 among the
S.R.s,[6]
Trudoviks,[7]
Bezzaglavtsi[8] and
Cadets,[9] with what existed and exists
among the Social-Democrats (somebody, some day—
probably a historian—will certainly do this work). You will
see that everyone, literally everyone outside the
Social-Democrats was discussing the same questions, literally the
very same, on account of which little groups have broken

    

away from our Party in the direction of liquidationism and
otzovism.

The bourgeois, the liberals, the S.R.s like to shout about
“squabbles” among the Social-Democrats, because they
themselves do not take “painful questions” seriously, tag
along behind others, play the diplomat, and make do with
eclecticism. The difference between the Social-Democrats
and all of them is that among the Social-Democrats
squabbles are the externals of a struggle of groups with profound
and clear ideological roots, while among them squabbles
are externally smoothed over, internally empty, petty,
trivial. Never and not for anything would I exchange the
sharp struggle of currents of opinion among the
Social-Democrats for the nicely smoothed emptiness and
intellectual poverty of the S.R.s and Co.

All the very best.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Greetings to M. F.!

P.S.
And in Russia there is a revolutionary revival, not
just a revival, but a revolutionary one. And we have
managed at last to set up a daily Pravda—incidentally, thanks
precisely to that (January)
Conference[1]

which the fools
are yapping at.
 

Notes
 

[1]
The Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.
—Ed.
 



[2]
The publications mentioned here—Pochin (Beginning), Izvestia
zagranichnoi oblastnoi organizatsii (Journal of the Regional
Organisation Abroad), Revolutsionnaya Mysl (Revolutionary Thought)
and Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia)—were run
by various groups and|trends in the Socialist-Revolutionary
Party.





[3]
Reference is to the novels by V. Ropshin (B. Savinkov), one of the
leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party: Kon bledny (The
Pale Horse), published in the magazine Russkaya Mysl (Russian
Thought) No. 1 for 1909, and To chego ne bylo (What Never
Happened), published in the magazine Zavety (Behests) Nos. 1–8,
April–November 1912, and in No. 1 for January 1913.





[4]
Vekhi (Landmarks)—a symposium published by the
Constitutional-Democrats in Moscow in the spring of 1909. Its articles
devoted to the Russian intelligentsia cast a slur on the
revolutionary-democratic traditions of the liberation movement in Russia, and the
views and activities of the outstanding revolutionary democrats^of
the nineteenth century V. G. Belinsky, N. A. Dobrolyubov,
N. G. Chernyshevsky and D. I. Pisarev. The contributors to the

   

symposium vilified the revolutionary movement of 1905 and
thanked the tsarist government for protecting the privileged classes
“with its bayonets and jails” from “fury of the people”.





[5]
Milyukov, P. N. (1859–1948)—leader of the Constitutional–
Democratic (Cadet) Party, prominent ideologist of the Russian
imperialist bourgeoisie. One of the men who in October 1905 founded the
Cadet Party, he became chairman of its Central Committee and
editor of its central organ, the newspaper Rech (Speech). He was a
member of the Third and Fourth Dumas. After the February
bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 he became Minister for
Foreign Affairs in the bourgeois Provisional Government and after
the October Socialist Revolution helped to organise the foreign
military intervention against Soviet Russia. Later ho was active
among the White émigrés.

Gredeskul, N. A. (b. 1864)—professor of law, publicist,
Constitutional-Democrat; deputy to the First Duma. Worked on Cadet
Rech and a number of other bourgeois-liberal papers. In 1916 he
left the Constitutional-Democratic Party. After the October
Socialist Revolution taught as a professor in Leningrad.





[6]
Socialist-Revolutionary Party (S.R.s)—a petty-bourgeois party in
Russia; emerged at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 as a
result of the union of various Narodnik groups and circles. The
S.R.s did not recognise the class differences between the
proletariat and the small owners. They glossed over the class
differentiation and contradictions within the peasantry and denied the
leading role of the proletariat in the revolution. The tactics of
individual terrorism which the S.R.s advocated as the main form
of struggle against the autocracy did great harm to the
revolutionary movement and made it more difficult to organise the masses
for revolutionary struggle.

The Bolshevik Party exposed the S.R.s’ attempts to masquerade
as socialists, waged a determined struggle against them for
influence over the peasantry, and exposed the harm caused to the
working-class movement by their tactics of individual terrorism. At
the same time the Bolsheviks, under certain conditions, made
temporary agreements with the S.R.s in the struggle against
tsarism.

The heterogeneity of the peasantry as a class determined the
political and ideological instability and organisational disunity
of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their constant wavering
between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In the period of
reaction (1907–10) the S.R.s suffered complete ideological and
organisational collapse. During the first world war the majority
of them became social-chauvinists.

After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic
revolution in 1917, the S.R.s together with the Mensheviks and the
Cadets were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary
bourgeois-landowner Provisional Government, and their leaders (Kerensky,
Avksentyev, Chernov) were members of it. The S.R. Party refused

   

to support the peasant demand for abolition of the landed estates
and came out in favour of landed proprietorship. The S.R.
ministers in the Provisional Government sent punitive expeditions
against peasants who had seized the landowners’ estates.

At the end of November 1917, the Left wing of the party formed
the independent party of Left S.R.s. In an attempt to preserve their
influence over the mass of the peasants, the Left S.R.s formally
recognised Soviet power and came to an agreement with the
Bolsheviks, but soon joined the struggle against Soviet power.

During the years of foreign intervention and civil war, the
S.R.s engaged in counter-revolutionary subversion, actively
supported the interventionists and whiteguards, participated in
counter-revolutionary conspiracies, and organised terrorist acts
against leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party.
After the Civil War the S.R.s continued their hostile activities
against the Soviet state.





[7]
Trudovik group (Trudoviks)—group of petty-bourgeois democrats
in the Duma, consisting of peasants and intellectuals with a
Narodnik orientation.

Their politics were the class politics of the small peasant
farmer and the Trudoviks in the Duma wavered between the Cadets
and Social-Democrats. Since the Trudoviks did to some extent
represent the peasant masses, the Bolsheviks in the Duma adopted
tactics of co-operating with them, in certain fields, for the sake of
the common struggle against tsarist autocracy and the Cadets.





[8]
Bezzaglavtsi—semi-Cadet, semi-Menshevik group of the Russian
bourgeois intelligentsia, formed when the revolution of 1905–07
was on the wane. It took its name from the political weekly Bez
Zaglaviya (Without a Title) published in St. Petersburg between
January and May 1906. Under cover of their formal non–
attachment to any party, the Bezzaglavtsi advocated bourgeois-liberal
and opportunist ideas, and supported the revisionists in the
Russian and international Social-Democratic movement.





[9]
Witte, S. Y. (1849–1915)—statesman of tsarist Russia, a convinced
supporter of the autocracy, who sought to preserve the monarchy
by means of small concessions and promises to the liberal

   

bourgeoisie and harsh repressive measures against the people. He was
Prime Minister (1905–06).

Dear Colleague,

Kamenev writes to us today that you have informed him
that peaceful relations have once again been restored
between Plekhanov and yourselves by the elimination of
“misunderstandings”.

I would very much ask you to let me know the
meaning of this dream. We had every reason to believe that the
rejection of the articles by
Dnevnitsky[2] and Plekhanov
regarding a concession to the liquidators (for it was 
precisely about this that they were writing, under the screen
of “unity”) took place quite deliberately and resolutely.
So what “misunderstandings” could there be in this case?

Are there not new misunderstandings in this latest
communication?

The last, or more precisely yesterday’s, editorial in Rech
(July 19) is of tremendous importance. It cannot be doubted
that the Cadets have done everything in their power (and
beyond it) to “hush up” Zvezda and Pravda.
And now they
have come out with it! It is clear that they themselves
have thereby admitted the danger. They have shown
themselves unable to pass it by and hush it up. They have
been driven out of their position of silence. And
Prokopovich and Blank in Zaprosy
Zhizni[3] echo them still more
crudely, stupidly, tearfully.

Now of all times it is essential, in my opinion, to bring
intense pressure to bear on Rech, to publish a number of
articles against it and inflame the struggle still further.
This is necessary both from the point of view of principle

    

(since only Zvezda and Pravda are carrying on a campaign
on behalf of work ins-class democracy, while both Rech
and the Prokopoviches approvingly pat the liquidators on
the back), and for practical reasons (since it is just this
more lively struggle that must liven up both arguments
and talks with the electors and their enrol men t in the
electoral registers).

Could you not find out how many people are registering,
by polling districts, streets and professions? It would be
extremely important to encourage them by concrete
examples, in order to arouse competition between districts, streets
and professions.

I hope you’ll be kind enough also to inform Nevskaya
Zvezda that I insist on the return of my article replying to
Blank (“Petty Artifices”) if it is not printed in No. 18.
I will in that case certainly print it in the journal. Now
that all the liberals + liquidators + non-Party and Co.
have turned against us, it would be criminal for us to keep
silent.

The election campaign in Petersburg has begun
successfully—the leadership has been won by
Zvezda and Pravda—
what is necessary is not to lose one’s grip on it, and 1o carry
through the Tight to a finish. This is in the interests of the
paper itself, quite apart from everything else, which, of
course, I do not mention.

I await news of the “positively decided” question.

With greetings,
 V. Ulyanov

P.S. I still await a reply about the articles: “The
Results of Six Months’
Work”.[1]


P.P.S. Couldn’t you at least send me a cutting from
No. 17 of Nevskaya Zvezda—the lit He article “Unity or
Split”?

Dear A. M.,

If you recognise that “our squabbles are produced by an
irreconcilable difference of ideological roots”—that the
same applies to the S.R.s (that it is the same with the
Cadets—Vekhi—this you did not add, but there can be
no doubt about it)—that there is being created a 
reformist (apt word!) party—then you cannot say both to the
liquidator and to his enemy: “Both of you are squabblers.”

In that case the business of those who have understood
the ideological roots of the “squabble”, without taking
part in it, is to help the masses to discover the roots, and
not to justify the masses for regarding the disputes as “a
private matter between the generals”.

We “leaders have not written a single clear book, not
a single sensible pamphlet”.... Untrue. We wrote as best
we could. No less clearly, no less sensibly, than before.
And we have written a lot. There have been cases when
we wrote against people without any “squabbling” (against
Vekhi[1]

against
Chernov,[3] against
Rozhkov,[2]

etc.). [Do
you see all the issues of Nevskaya Zvezda?]

... “The result of this: among the workers in Russia
there are a great number of good ... young people, but they
are so furiously irritated with those abroad”....
This is a
fact; but it is not the fault of the “leaders”, it is the result
of the detachment, or, more truly, the tearing asunder
of Russia and the emigrant centres. What has been torn
    

asunder must be tied together again, and to abuse the leaders
is cheap and popular, but of little use ... “that they dissuade
the workers from taking part in the conference”....

What conference? The one the liquidators are now calling?
Why, we ourselves are dissuading them too! Isn’t there
some misunderstanding on your part about
this?[4]

I have read that Amfiteatrov has written, in some Warsaw
paper,[5] if I am not mistaken, in favour of boycotting the
Fourth Duma? Do you happen to have this article? Send
it me, I will return it.

Things are warming up in the Baltic Fleet! I had a visit
in Paris (this is between ourselves) by a special delegate
sent by a meeting of the sailors and Social-Democrats.
What’s lacking is organisation—it’s enough to make one
weep!! If you have any officer contacts, you should make
every effort to arrange something. The sailors are in a
fighting mood, but they may all perish again in vain.

Your articles in Zaprosy Zhizni were not too good. It’s
a strange journal, by the way—liquidationist–
Trudovik-Vekhi.
A “classless reformist” party just about sums it up....

You ask why I am in Austria. The C.C. has organised
a Bureau here (between ourselves): the frontier is close by,
we make use of it, it’s nearer to Petersburg, we get the
papers from there on the third day, it’s become far easier
to write to the papers there, co-operation with them goes
better. There is less squabbling here, which is an
advantage. There isn’t a good library, which is a disadvantage.
It’s hard without books.

All the very best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Greetings to M. F.

Dear Colleague,

You remind me again about the address of a friend. You
have already asked me once for this address, and T sent it
to you. It was added by me—I well remember—at the
very end of a long letter. Look this up if you can. But
perhaps it is simpler to repeat the address: Herrn Kurt
Lauschner, Beuthen (Ober-Schlesien). Piekarerstr. 19/III,
Germany. Inside it is essential to add: for Herr Hörsing:
Für Herrn Hörsing (there are two Beuthens in Germany,
therefore it is necessary to specify
“Ober-Schlesien”)...[1]

has arrived. Many thanks. Dansky’s manuscript has also
arrived. I am extremely surprised that today, when I had
from you both Pravda and a packet of reactionary papers,
I did not receive Thursday’s Nevsky Golos. But I, for a
number of important reasons, very much need to have
Nevsky Golos directly it appears. If it does not appear,
please don’t be too lazy to send me two words about it
at once. It is extremely important for me to know as soon
as possible whether it appeared on Thursday, August 23
(as Nevsky Golos promised on August 17), and, if it did
appear, to get a copy. By the way, I sent you a long time
ago a list of issues of Zvezda, Nevskaya Zvezda, Pravda
and Zhivoye Dyelo missing from my files. You still don’t
reply whether you can send them. Yet one mutual friend
told me the other day that you have files of Zvezda and
Nevskaya Zvezda. Let me know, please, whether you have
kept the list I sent, and whether you can send me the missing

    

issues. I take advantage of this opportunity to
congratulate Comrade Vitimsky (I hope it will not be difficult
for you to pass this letter on to him) on the remarkably fine
article in Pravda
(No. 98)[2] which I received today. The
subject chosen was extremely topical, and was splendidly
worked out in a brief but clear form. In general it would
be useful from time to time to recall, quote and explain in
Pravda Shchedrin and other writers of the “old” Narodnik
democratic movement. For the readers of Pravda—for the
25,000—this would be appropriate and interesting, and
also it would throw light on present-day questions of
working-class democracy from another point of view, and in
other words.

What is the circulation of Pravda? Don’t you think it
might be useful to publish monthly statistics, even briefly
(circulation, name of town and district)? What could be the
arguments against publishing them? If there are no special
considerations, it seems to me that you should publish.

I almost forgot. We have had a number of complaints
from various places abroad that neither when subscriptions
are sent, nor when money is sent for particular issues,
does Pravda arrive. I don’t get it regularly now myself.
This means undoubtedly that something is wrong in the
dispatch department. Please take the most energetic steps
you can. Look yourselves at the letters from abroad about
subscriptions, and get the matter cleared up. Send one copy
of Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda to the following address:
Frl. Slutzky: Katherinenstr. 8 g. H.II (bei Worte),
Halensee, Berlin.

Dear A. M.,

How is your health? Last time the news you sent me was
not good—temperature rising, etc. Are you quite well again?
Write a couple of words: I shall be very grateful.

Still nothing from you in Pravda. A pity. You ought
to support the paper.

We are now “up to the ears” in the elections.
Absenteeism is damnably great. In the worker curia likewise.
But still everywhere Social-Democrats have been elected.
Very much depends on the outcome of the elections for the
building up of the
Party.[1]

Have you heard anything about the liquidators’
conference?

In what journal will you be printed? What’s happening
about Znaniye?

All the best, and I wish you a speedy and sound recovery.

Regards to M. F.

 Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the elections to the Fourth State Duma, which
ended on November 7 (20), 1912.





[2]
Luch (Bay)—legal daily newspaper put out by Menshevik
liquidators in St. Petersburg from September 1912 to July 1913. In all
237 issues appeared. The newspaper existed mainly on the
liberals’ donations. Its policy was controlled by P. B. Axelrod,
F. I. Dan, L. Martov and A. S. Martynov.





[3]
Dyen, (The Day)—liberal-bourgeois daily paper, published in
St. Petersburg from 1912 until it was closed down on October 26
(November 8), 1917. Its contributors were Menshevik liquidators,
who took over the paper completely after the February
bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917.





[4]

Dear A. M.,

The other day I had a letter from the editorial board
of Pravda in Petersburg, in which they ask me to write to
you that they would be extremely glad of your regular
contributions. “We would like to offer Gorky 25 kopeks
a line, but we are afraid of offending him.” That’s what
they write to me.

To my mind, there is nothing at all to be offended at.
Nobody could even dream of your contributions
depending on considerations of payment. In the same way,
everybody knows that the workers’ Pravda, which usually pays
2 kopeks a line, and still more frequently pays nothing,
cannot attract anyone by its fees.

But there is nothing bad about contributors’ to a workers’
paper receiving regular payment, however small it may
be. In fact, it’s all to the good. The circulation is now
20–25 thousand. It’s time it began thinking of a proper
arrangement about payment for contributions. What is
bad about everybody working on a workers’ paper beginning
to earn a little? And how can there be anything offensive
in this proposal?

I am sure that the fears of the Petersburg editors of
Pravda are quite without foundation, and that you will not
treat their proposal otherwise than in comradely fashion.
Write a couple of words, either to them direct at the office,
or to me.

Tomorrow is the election of electors in Petersburg (for
the worker curia). The struggle with the liquidators has

    

developed. In Moscow and Kharkov the Party people have
won.

Have you seen Luch, and do you get it at all? There are
people who have fiddled the cards and pretend to be “
kindhearted”!

I have seen an advertisement for
Krugozor.[1] Is this
your undertaking, or are you there by invitation?

Every good wish, and above all for your health.
Greetings to M. F.

Yours,
 Lenin

47. Ulica Lubomirskiego. Krakau.

Dear Colleague^

I read today in Pravda and in Luch about the result of
the elections for the worker curia in Petersburg. I cannot but
express to you my congratulations on the leading article
in No. 146. At a moment of defeat, inflicted not by the
Social-Democrats (analysis of the figures clearly shows
that it was not Social-Democrats who got the liquidators
in), the editorial hoard at once look the appropriate, firm
and dignified tone in pointing out the significance of a protest
in principle against “belittling”. Don’t misunderstand, these
lines. Don’t think that they are produced by anything
except the desire to share my thoughts, so natural for a
constant contributor. It was a difficult time. The struggle
was hard. Almost everything possible was done, but
demoralisation had its effect, and the non-Party workers gave
their votes to the opportunists. All the more essential,
then, is the strictly principled, insistent and stubborn work
of the united whole (the united editorial board, for example,
or the general body of contributors, and so forth) to
counteract the demoralisation.

It is extremely important not to break off the study of
the election results which Pravda began, but to continue it.
To collect and print the votes of all the candidates (you
have only 9 out of 13). To collect and print an enquiry
into how the non-Party workers voted, how the Putilov

    

workers voted (7 and 2 liquidators), the Semyannikov
workers voted (2 and 1 liquidator), and so on, factory by factory.

Only Pravda can do this important job with success.

Greetings and best wishes.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Colleague,

I send you the St. Petersburg Mandate which by chance,
thanks to an opportunity of very speedy delivery, reached
us from Petersburg. Publish this Mandate to the St. 
Petersburg deputy without fail, in a prominent position and in
large type. It is quite intolerable that Luch, distorting
the Mandate, is already mentioning it and printing reports
about it, while Pravda, whose supporters drew up the
Mandate and got it adopted and put it into action, is silent
about it.... What does this mean? Can a workers’
newspaper exist if it behaves with such contempt for what
interests the workers? (Naturally, if certain expressions and
phrases are undesirable from the censorship point of view,
partial changes are possible, as usually happens in such
cases.) But not to print such a thing means not only to
give ground for hundreds of disputes, in which Pravda
will be the guilty party, but also to inflict the greatest
possible damage on it as a newspaper, on the circulation
and organisation of the paper as an undertaking. A
newspaper, after all, is not just something for the reader to do
a bit of reading in and the writer to do a bit of writing in.
A newspaper must itself seek out, itself discover in good
time arid, at the appropriate moment, print certain material.
A paper must look for and find the contacts it needs. Yet here
suddenly is a Mandate to the St. Petersburg deputy, coming
from the supporters of Pravda, but not printed in Pravda...
Please reply immediately on receiving this letter.

Dear Colleague,

We were extremely sad to see two blunders in Sunday’s
Pravda. First, there was no article about the Basle
Congress, and secondly, you did not print the greetings to the
Congress from Badayev and the
others.[1] As regards the
first point, we are partly to blame as well, because we did not
send an article. We were busy with extremely urgent and
important affairs. It would not have been at all difficult
to write such an article, and the editorial board of Pravda
knew that the Congress was opening on Sunday. But the
second omission is entirely the responsibility of Badayev.
It is quite unforgivable that he is not concerned about
his paper, that he signs anything that may turn up without
at once taking it to his paper. A workers’ paper in
Petersburg without the co-operation of the workers’ deputy for
Petersburg (particularly as he is a Pravda supporter) is
a stupid situation. It is most essential to pay as much
attention as possible to this important omission, both on
the part of the whole editorial board and on the part of
Baturin[2] (to whom, by the way, please pass on this letter,
and from whom it would be very pleasant to have a couple
of lines), and on the part of the deputy himself.

You asked for the address of Gorky. Here it is: Signor
Massimo Gorki. Villa Spinola. Capri (Napoli). Italie.

Here is the address of a correspondent in Rome; write
to him, he will contribute to Pravda: B. Antonoff, Via le
Giulio Cesare, 47. Roma. Italy.
 

Why don’t you send the money you owe? This delay is
causing us great difficulties. Please don’t be late. Why
haven’t you replied to the request to print a notice in the
paper that the editorial board is looking for Nos. 5–10 of
Pravda?

I wish you all the best.

Yours,
 V.

Dear Al. M.,

It seems a long time since we have had any word from
you. How are you getting on? Are you well?

I received today No. 187 of Pravda with the
subscriptions for 1913. The paper is having a hard passage: since
the summer decline in circulation, the rise has been very
slow, and a deficit remains. They have even temporarily
stopped payment to two permanent contributors, which has
made our position exceptionally difficult.

We propose to develop intensive agitation among the
workers for subscriptions, and to use the money collected to
strengthen the paper and expand it, because since the opening
of the Duma there has been no room at all for articles.

I hope you too will take part in the agitation for
subscriptions, in order to help in “rescuing” the paper. In
what form? If you have a tale or something suitable, the
announcement of it will make very good agitation. If not,
send them a promise to provide one in the near future,
and particularly in 1913. Finally, a few simple lines, in a
letter to the workers from you, about the importance of
supporting the workers’ paper actively (by subscriptions,
sales, collections), would also be splendid agitation.

Please drop a line about one or the other—direct to the
editor of Pravda (2 Yamskaya, St. Petersburg) or to me
here (Ulijanow, 47, Lubomirskiego, Krakau).

Probably there will be no war, and we shall remain here
for the time being, “taking advantage” of the desperate
hatred of the Poles towards tsarism.
 

The liquidators are now carrying on an attack against
revolutionary strikes! They’ve sunk to that. There is talk
of a strike and demonstration for January 9.

Among the workers’ deputies, for the first time in the
three Dumas (2nd, 3rd, 4th), all six deputies from the chief
gubernias are on the side of the Party. Things are difficult,
but still the cause is going ahead.

Have you seen the “defence” of Ropshin in
Zavety,[1]
in the name of “freedom of thought and criticism” (in reply
to the letter to the editor from Natanson and Co.)? That
is worse than any liquidationism—renegacy which is
muddled, cowardly, evasive and nonetheless systematic!

We are swimming “against the stream”.... One has now
to fight for revolutionary agitation among the masses
against very many “would-be revolutionaries”.... Among
the mass of the workers there is unquestionably a
revolutionary mood, but the new democratic intelligentsia (
including the workers’ intelligentsia) with a revolutionary
ideology is growing up slowly, lagging behind, can’t yet
catch up.

Very warm greetings!

Write me a couple of words.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Greetings to M. F.! She has somehow fallen quite,
quite silent....

Dear A. M.,

New Year’s greetings to you, too! I wish you all the
very best, and above all health! We have
Malinovsky,[1]
Petrovsky and Badayev staying with us just now.
Yesterday I received your letter and read it out to them. They
were all extraordinarily pleased. Malinovsky wanted to
visit you, but probably the distance will be a barrier.
Ah, if only you could be nearer to us.... If your health
permitted, you could transfer to the local Galician health
resorts like Zakopane, find a healthy place in the
mountains, two days nearer to Russia; we could get more
frequent visits from the workers, once again organise a
workers’
school[2]: crossing the frontier is not difficult, the price
of the journey from Petersburg is 12 rubles, contacts with
the workers of Moscow and the South are also possible....
I’ve been really day-dreaming in connection with M. F.’s
journey.... That was a wonderful idea of hers, really
wonderful. Make sure to drop me a line, when you have a chance,
whether she has succeeded in getting her legal papers (
probably she will succeed). Also let me know how Malinovsky
can find her in Petersburg or in Moscow. Through Tikhonov?
If we can’t find some cash to expand and strengthen Pravda,
it will perish. The deficit is now 50–60 rubles a day. We
have to increase the circulation, reduce costs, expand the
paper. We have held out for 200 issues—a record. After
all, we are influencing twenty to thirty thousand worker–

    

readers systematically in a Marxist spirit: it is something
really big, and we should be damnably sorry if the paper
went under. We are discussing with the deputies, from every
point of view and in every possible way, how to get Pravda
out of its difficulties, but fear that without financial help
from outside we won’t succeed.

Malinovsky, Petrovsky and Badayev send you warm
greetings and best wishes. They are good fellows,
especially the first. Really, it is possible to build a workers’
party with such people, though the difficulties are
incredibly great. The base at Cracow has proved to be useful:
our move to Cracow has fully “paid for itself” (from the
point of view of the cause). The deputies confirm that a
revolutionary mood is unquestionably growing among the
mass of the workers. If we now create a good proletarian
organisation, without obstacles from the treacherous
liquidators—the devil knows what victories we can then win
when the movement from below develops....

What you write about letters from Russia is remarkably
interesting and characteristic. Menshevik workers say that
Russia has outlived Marx!! And this is not the only case.
The liquidators introduce such corruption, such a spirit
of treachery, such desertion, as it is difficult to imagine.
And in addition, thousands of intrigues for “uniting” with
them: the only way to make a mess of the whole cause, to
spoil the building of the Party, which has had a difficult
start, is once again to begin the intrigues =“unity” with
the liquidators. Well, the battle isn’t over yet....

I am ready to share with all my heart in your joy at the
return of the Vperyod group, if...
if your supposition is
justified that “Machism,
god-building[3] and all that
nonsense has been dumped for ever”,
as you write. If that is
so, if the Vperyod people have understood this or will
understand it now, then I warmly join in your delight at
their return. But I underline “if” because this, so far, is
still a hope rather than a fact. Do you remember, at Capri
in the spring of 1908, our “last meeting” with Bogdanov,
Bazarov and
Lunacharsky[4]? Do you remember how I
said that we should have to part company for two or three
years, and how then M. F., in the chair, furiously protested,
calling me to order,
etc.![5]
 

It has turned out to be four and a half, nearly five years.
And this is not very long, for such a period of the most
profound collapse as occurred in 1908–11. I don’t know
whether Bogdanov, Bazarov, Volsky (a semi-anarchist),
Lunacharsky,
Alexinsky[6] are capable of learning from the
painful experience of 1908–11. Have they understood that
Marxism is a more serious and more profound thing than
it seemed to them, that one cannot scoff at it, as Alexinsky
used to do, or dismiss it as something dead, as the others
did? If they have understood this—a thousand greetings
to them, and everything personal (inevitably brought in
by the sharpness of the struggle) will in one moment be
thrown on the scrap-heap. But if they haven’t understood
it, if they haven’t learned anything, then don’t hold it
against me: friendship is friendship, but duty is duty.
Against attempts to abuse Marxism or to confuse the policy
of the workers’ party we shall fight without sparing our
lives.

I am very glad it is through Pravda, which did not
directly attack them, that the way has been found for the gradual
return of the Vperyod people. Very glad. But for the sake
of a lasting rapprochement, we must now move towards
it slowly and cautiously. That is what I have written to
Pravda too. And friends of the reunion of the Vperyodists
with us must bend their efforts to this also: a careful, tested
return of the Vperyodists from Machism,
otzovism,[7]
god-building can yield great results. The least carelessness, any
“recurrence of the Machist, otzovist, etc., disease”, and
the struggle will burst, out still more violently.... I have
not read the new “Philosophy of Living Experience” by
Bogdanov, probably the same old Machism in a new dress....

We have excellent connections with Sergei Moiseyev in
Paris. We have known him a long time, and are working
together. He is a real Party man and Bolshevik. It, is with
such people that we are building the Party, but there are
damnably few of them left.

Once again I wish you the best: I must finish this letter,
which has become indecently long. Good health!

Yours,
 Lenin
 

N. K. sends her warm greetings!

(Some more good workers from Russia have gathered
here. We are organising a
conference.[8] Alas, we haven’t
the money, or we could get a devil of a lot done from this
base!)

I am writing to Pravda today that they, after asking
Tikhonov, should print a notice that Tikhonov and you
are in charge of the literary ^department of Pravda. Isn’t
that so? Write to them yourself, if they don’t print it.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Malinovsky was subsequently exposed as an agent provocateur.





[2]
Reference is to the Party school at Poronin, which the C.C. of
the R.S.D.L.P. planned to organise in 1913, during the Duma’s
summer recess, for members of the Social-Democratic group in the
Duma, workers and Party activists. Lenin intended giving an
important series of lectures on political economy, the theory and
practice of socialism in Russia, and on the agrarian and
nationalities problems. Difficulties, such as lack of funds, etc., prevented
the school from being organised.





[3]
Machism, or empirio-criticism—reactionary subjective-idealist
philosophical trend which became widespread in Western Europe
at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
centuries. Its founders were the Austrian physicist and philosopher
Ernst Mach and the German philosopher Richard Avenarius.
In Russia, during the years of reaction, the influence of Machism
made itself felt among some intellectuals of the R.S.D.L.P.,
particularly Menshevik intellectuals (N. Valentinov, P. Yushkevich
and others). Some literary men among the Bolsheviks also adopted
Machist positions (V. Bazarov, A. Bogdanov and others). Though
they claimed to advocate Marxism, the Russian Machists were
trying to revise the fundamental principles of Marxist philosophy.
In his book Materialism and Empirio-criticism Lenin revealed the
reactionary essence of Machism, defended Marxist philosophy from

   

revisionist attacks and in the new historical conditions obtaining
at the time pushed forward the development of dialectical and
historical materialism in all respects. The defeat of Machism was
a crippling blow to the ideology of Menshevism, otzovism and
god-building.

God-building—A religious-philosophical trend hostile to
Marxism. It arose during the period of reaction among certain Party
intellectuals who departed from Marxism after the defeat of the
1905–07 revolution. The god-builders (A. V. Lunacharsky, V. 
Bazarov and others) advocated a new “socialist” religion and tried
to reconcile Marxism with religion. Maxim Gorky was at one time
associated with them.





[4]
Bogdanov, A. =

(Malinovsky, A. A.; =

Maximov, N.) (1873–1928)—
Social-Democrat, philosopher, sociologist, economist; by training,
a doctor. After the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. he joined
the Bolsheviks and was elected a member of the Central
Committee. He was on the editorial boards of the Bolshevik newspapers
Vperyod and Proletary, =

and worked as an editor of the Bolshevik
newspaper Novaya Zhizn (New Life). In the years of reaction (1907–
10) and the subsequent revolutionary revival ho headed the
otzovists, and the Vperyod anti-Party group. In philosophy he tried
to create his own system of “empiric-monism” (a variety of
subjective-idealist philosophy), which Lenin criticised sharply in his
Materialism and Empirio-criticism. At a meeting of the enlarged
editorial board of the newspaper Proletary in June 1909 Bogdanov
was expelled from the Bolshevik Party. After the October Socialist
Revolution he became one of the organisers and leaders of the
Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation). From 1926 onwards he
was director of the Blood-Transfusion Institute which he had
founded.

Bazarov, V. (real name Rudnev, V. A.) (1874–1939)—
philosopher and economist, joined the Social-Democratic movement in
1896.

Between 1905 and 1907 he contributed to a number of Bolshevik
publications, gave up Bolshevism in the years of reaction, and
became one of the main representatives of the Machist revision of
Marxism.

Lunacharsky, A. V. (1875–1933)—professional revolutionary,
prominent Soviet statesman.

Having entered the revolutionary movement in the early
nineties, he became a Bolshevik after the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. During the years of reaction he turned away from
Marxism, took part in the anti-Party Vperyod group, and called
for the merging of religion and Marxism.





[5]
Lenin visited Capri for a few days at Gorky’s request in April
1908. During his stay he told A. Bogdanov, V. Bazarov and
A. V. Lunacharsky that he definitely disagreed with them in
matters of philosophy.





[6]
Alexinsky, G. A. (b. 1879)—started his political career as a
Social-Democrat. An otzovist and one of the organisers of the anti-Party

   

Vperyod group in the years of reaction, he became a social–
chauvinist during the world war and worked for a number of bourgeois
papers. In July 1917 he made slanderous allegations against Lenin
and the Bolsheviks. In April 1918 he fled the country.





[7]
Otzovism (from the Russian “otozvat”—to recall)—an opportunist
trend among the Bolsheviks, which was led by A. Bogdanov.
Under cover of revolutionary phrases the otzovists (besides
Bogdanov the group included G. A. Alexinsky, S. Volsky, A. V.
Lunacharsky and M. N. Lyadov) demanded the recall of the
Social-Democratic deputies from the Third Duma. They also refused to
work in legal organisations. Declaring that under conditions of
reaction the Party should conduct only illegal work, the otzovists
refused to participate in the Duma, the trade unions, the
cooperatives or any mass legal and semilegal organisations.

A variety of otzovism was ultimatumism. The ultimatumists
proposed that the Social-Democratic deputies in the Duma should
be presented with an ultimatum demanding implicit obedience to
the decisions of the Party Central Committee and, if they rejected
it, that they should be recalled. Ultimatumism was actually a
masked form of otzovism. Lenin called the ultimatumists “bashful
otzovists”.

The otzovists caused great harm to the Party. Their policy
would have isolated the Party from the masses and converted it
into a sectarian organisation.





[8]
Reference is to the Conference of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. with
Party workers, known for conspiratorial purposes as the “
February Conference”. It look place in Cracow on December 26, 1912,
lasting till January 1, 1913 (January 8–14, 1913).

January 25, 1913

Dear Comrade,

In answer to your request, I am sending you as brief an
“exposé” as
possible.[1] If you had not added that “the history
of the polemics” would not be barred from your book, it
would have been quite impossible to give an account of
Bolshevism.

Moreover, doubt has been aroused in my mind by your
sentence: “I shall try to make no changes in your account.”
I must lay down as a condition for it being printed that
there are to be no changes whatsoever. (As to purely
censorship changes we could, of course, come to a special
arrangement.)

If it doesn’t suit, please return the sheet.

With fraternal greetings,
 N. Lenin

My address is: Wl. Uljanow. 47. Lubomirskiego. Krakau.
Autriche.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to his article “On Bolshevism”, which was written
for the second volume of N. A. Rubakin’s book Sredi Knig (Among
Hooks) (see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 485–86).

On January 10 (N.S.), 1913, Rubakin wrote Lenin a letter
asking him for a “brief exposé (not more than one sheet of
notepaper) ... of the very essence of Bolshevism and to indicate the
books where this essence is expounded”. Lenin’s article in the
second volume of Sredi Knig was published without alterations.

Dear A. M.,

Of course, I have nothing against your sending my letter
to Tikhonov.

After your account I have become interested in
Lunacharsky’s article “Between Fear and Hope”. Couldn’t
you send it to me, if you have a copy? If you want it I
shall return it without fail.

The collections for the Moscow paper rejoiced us greatly.
Our trio of deputies from Moscow Region—Malinovsky,
Shagov and Samoilov—will set about this. That has already
been agreed. But care is needed: before consolidating
Pravda, we cannot set about a Moscow paper. We have
a plan for organising a Moskovskaya
Pravda.[3]

Please write to Tikhonov that he should talk only to
Badayev and Malinovsky—but he must talk with them.

I was particularly glad of the following words in your
letter: “From all the plans and suppositions of the Russian
intelligentsia, it is clear beyond any doubt that socialist
thought is
interlarded with various currents radically
hostile to it. They include mysticism, and metaphysics,
and opportunism, and reformism, and relapses into
Narodism. All these currents are all the more hostile because
they are extremely indefinite and, not having their own
platforms, cannot determine themselves with sufficient
clarity.”

I underline the words which have particularly delighted
me. That’s just it: “radically hostile”, and all the more
so because they are indefinite. You ask, for example, about

    

Stepanov
(I. I.).[4] What did he turn out to be in the era
of collapse and vacillation, 1908–11 (yet he was a good
fellow, a hard worker, well-read, etc.)? He wanted to make
peace with the Vperyodists. But then that means that he
was wobbling himself.

He wrote letters to me about giving up the democratic
revolution in Russia as a bad job, that in our country things
would proceed without revolution, on Austrian lines.
I branded him as a liquidator for these philistine ideas.
He was offended. And then
Larin[5] blurted out his ideas
in print.

Now Stepanov is demonstratively writing not for us but
for Rozhkov’s paper Novaya Sibir at
Irkutsk.[6] And do
you know what “trend” Rozhkov has discovered? Did you
read his article in Nasha Zarya of 1911 and my reply in
Zvezda?[1]

And Rozhkov has dug himself in as an arch–
opportunist. And Stepanov? Allah knows. That’s just it: an
“extremely indefinite” and muddled position. I should
never entrust any at all independent department to
Stepanov now: he himself doesn’t know where he will jump
next. But probably he could be a useful contributor. He
is one of those who haven’t “seen clearly”. To commission
him to “organise” a department means to kill both him
and the department for certain.

You write: “It’s time we had our journal, but we haven’t,
a sufficient number of people who have come properly to
terms with each other for this.”

I don’t accept the second part of this sentence. The
journal would oblige a sufficient number of people to come to
terms with each other, provided there was a journal,
provided there was a nucleus.

A nucleus does exist, but there is no full-size journal
for external reasons—no money. If we had money, I am
sure we could manage a full-size journal even now, because
in addition to the nucleus of contributors we could, for
payment, draw in a lot of people by giving out subjects
and allocating jobs.
 

So long as we have no money, we must in my opinion
not only dream hut build upon what we’ve got, in other
words, on
Prosveshcheniye.[7] Of course, it’s a little fish,
but in the first place a big fish, like everything else, grows
from a little one. Secondly, better a little fish than a big
cockroach.

It’s time, high time, to begin coming to terms, if we want
to have “people who have come to terms” in large numbers.

“It’s time we had our journal.” The literary nucleus
is there. The correctness of the line has been confirmed
by the experience of 12 years (or even 20), and particularly
by the experience of the last six years. We should gather
around this nucleus, thereby defining it in greater detail,
training it up and expanding. We had to begin with the
illegal one and with Pravda. But we don’t want to stop
at that. And therefore, once you have said that “it’s time
we had our journal”, allow me to call you to account for
these words: either to draft out at once a plan of enquiries
for money for a full-size journal with such-and-such a
programme, such-and-such an editorial board and
such-and-such a body of contributors, or to begin on the same
plan expanding Prosveshcheniye.

Or more truly, not either—or, but both.

I await your reply. You probably have already had a
letter from Vienna about Prosveshcheniye. There is a reliable
hope of consolidating it for 1913 in a smaller form. You
want us to “have our journal”, then let’s push it ahead
together.

I haven’t heard anything about the Dashnaks. But I
think it’s a nonsensical rumour. It’s been started by the
government, which wants to swallow up Turkish
Armenia.[8]

The
P.P.S.[2]

are undoubtedly for Austria and will fight
for her. A war between Austria and Russia would be a
very useful thing for the revolution (throughout Eastern
Europe), but it’s not very probable that Franz-Josef and
Nicky will give us this pleasure.

You ask me to keep you better informed. With pleasure—
only you must reply. I send you (for the time being

    

confidentially) the resolutions of our recent conference (which
in my view was very successful and will play its
part).[9]

Resolutions, they say, are of all forms of literature the
most boring. I am a man who has consumed too many
resolutions. Drop me a line about how readable they are
for you (especially about revolutionary strikes and about
the liquidators).

What bad effect has the rumour about an amnesty had
in Russia? I don’t know. Drop me a line.

N. K. sends her regards.

All the best.
 Yours,
 Lenin

[3]
Reference is to the newspaper Nash Put (Our Path). Lenin had
pointed out the necessity for a legal workers’ newspaper in
Moscow in the summer of 1912. But the fund-collecting campaign for
the Moscow newspaper did not begin until November 1912. 
Pravda No. 176 for November 24 (O.S), 1912 published a “Letter from
a Group of Moscow Workers”, which indicated that it would be
possible and opportune to start a workers’ newspaper in Moscow.
The call to make collections for the paper was enthusiastically
supported by the workers, but, its appearance was delayed by the
arrest, in February 1913, of the group of Bolsheviks who were
starting it.


The first number of Nash Put appeared on August 25 (
September 7), 1913. Lenin was active on the paper. Its contributors
included Maxim Gorky, Demyan Bedny, M. S. Olminsky, I. I.
Skvortsov-Stepanov, and also the Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth
Duma. Nash Put was very popular among the workers and received
donations from 395 workers’ groups. When the paper was banned
on September 12 (25), 1913, after only 16 issues had appeared, the
Moscow workers staged a protest strike but did not succeed in
getting the ban lifted.





[4]
Skvortsov-Stepanov, I. I. (1870–1928)—one of the oldest
participants in the Russian revolutionary movement. He joined the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1896, becoming a Bolshevik and Marxist writer
towards the end of 1904. On several occasions between 1907 and
1911 he was nominated by the Bolsheviks as a candidate for the
Duma. In the period of reaction he held incorrect views on the
agrarian problem and adopted a conciliatory attitude to the
anti-Party Vperyod group, but under Lenin’s influence overcame his
mistakes.





[5]
Larin, Y. (Lurye, M. A.) (1882–1932)—Social-Democrat,
Menshevik. After the defeat of the 1905–07 revolution he became an active
supporter of liquidationism, but in August 1917 was admitted to
the Bolshevik Party. After the October Socialist Revolution he
held various administrative and managerial posts.





[6]
Novaya Sibir (New Siberia)—socio-political and literary daily
newspaper with a liberal orientation. It was published in Irkutsk
from December 1912 to February 1913. The liquidator N. Rozhkov
was, in practice, its editor.





[7]
Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment)—legal Bolshevik socio-political
and literary monthly; began publication in St. Petersburg in
December 1911. Maxim Gorky was editor of the fiction section. The
magazine was banned by the tsarist government on the eve of the
first world war, in June 1914. One further issue (a double one)
appeared in the autumn of 1917.





[8]
Reference is probably to rumours of the possibility of a rising in
Turkish Armenia under the leadership of the Armenian
bourgeois-nationalist Dashnaktsutyun Party. This was suggested in an
article “Turkish Armenians and Russia” in the newspaper Russkoye
Slovo (Russian Word) No. 7, January 9, 1913.





[9]
Reference is to the resolutions of the Cracow Conference of the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. and Party workers (January 8–14, 1913).

To Comrade Andrei, and if he is not in Petersburg, then
to Nos. 3, 6 and
others.[2]

Dear Friend,

I was extremely sorry to hear that you consider that
Vasily exaggerates the importance of
Dyen.[3] In reality
the key to the situation at present is precisely Dyen and
the way it is run. Unless we secure a reform and proper
management in this field, we shall reach bankruptcy, both
material and political. Dyen is the necessary means of
organisation for uniting and lifting up the movement.
Only through this means can now come the necessary influx
of people and resources for what you indicate. Things are
bad in Petersburg primarily because Dyen is bad, and we
are unable to make, or the board of “editors” there prevents
us making use of Dyen.

At one kopek a month 25,000 will provide 250 rubles.
Remember without fail that there are no other sources at
all. The whole situation in general will now depend on the
outcome of the struggle with the liquidators in Petersburg.
That is clear. And this struggle can be decided only by the
proper management of Dyen. If it is true that Nos. 1 and
3, or 3 and 6, are for caution in reforming Dyen, i.e., for
delay in expelling the present editors and office staff, this
is very sad. We repeat: this smells of bankruptcy. We must

    

seriously come to agreement and set about reforming Dyen.
(1) We need accounts made up to the last kopek.
(2) Has
No. 1 had a letter about this?
(3) Have you read this letter?
(4) You must take the cash (revenue and subscriptions)
into your own hands.
(5) Will this be done, and when will
it be done?
(6) It is essential to put in our own editorial
board of Dyen and throw out the present one. Work is
thoroughly bad at present, the boosting of the Bundist
liquidators (Zeit) and the non-Social-Democrat Jagiello is
an absolute disgrace. The absence of a campaign for unity
from below is stupid and base. They keep silent about
unity on Vasilyevsky Island, about the liquidators’ refusal,
they don’t know how to reply to No. 101 of
Luch[4] or to
their reply: are such people editors? They are not people,
but wretched wet-rags and wreckers of the cause.

The use made of Dyen for keeping the class-conscious
workers informed and reporting their work (the Petersburg
Committee particularly) is beneath all criticism. You must
put an end to the so-called autonomy of these editorial
failures. You must set about it before all else. You should
install yourself in “sanctuary” with No. 1. Put in a telephone.
Take the editorial board into your own hands. Draw in
assistants. You on your own—with some of these people as
pure executives—given our work from here, can fully cope
with the job. If this is well organised, there will also be a
revival in the work of the Petersburg Committee, which is
ridiculously inept, incapable of saying a word, lets every
occasion for a statement go by. And it ought to be making
a statement almost daily in legal form (in the name of
“influential workers”, etc.) and at least once or twice a
month illegally. Once again, the key to the whole situation
is Dyen. Here it is possible to conquer, and then (only then)
organise the local work as well. Otherwise everything
will collapse.

You should wail, so far as a Moscow paper is concerned.
But No. 3 and his two colleagues should publish a letter
immediately. Their delay is unforgivable. They should
come out immediately, take up their position, declare that
this is our affair—the affair of those three—that they are
in charge (otherwise the liquidators will elbow them out).
Much has already been lost, hurry.
 

So a statement must be made. Why shouldn’t No. 3,
too, be a publisher? What in general is the distribution
o! duties between Nos. 1, 3, 6 and their immediate friends?
Has there been a report? Is there complete agreement?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter deals with the state of affairs in the Pravda editorial
office at the end of 1912 and the beginning of 1913. The “February”
Conference of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. and Party workers in
Cracow in 1913 prescribed measures for improving the editors’
work.





[2]
Members of the Bolshevik group in the Fourth Duma were referred
to by their “numbers” for purposes of secrecy. No. 1 was A. Y.
Badayev, No. 3—R. V. Malinovsky, and No. 6—G. I. Petrovsky.

Dyen (The Day)—cover name for Pravda.





[4]
Lenin refers to a leading article “The Working Masses and the
Underground” published in the Menshevik liquidators’ paper
Luch No. 15 (101), January 19, 1913. It was aimed against the
Party’s illegal work. This liquidationist sally was exposed by
Lenin in his article “To the Social-Democrats”, published as a
hectographed leaflet in Cracow (see present edition, Vol. 18,
pp. 529–31).

Dear Colleagues,

I cannot but express my indignation at the printing by
the editorial board of Mr. Bogdanov’s stupid and impudent
letter in No. 24, and the senseless note from the
editors.[1]
It had been precisely and clearly laid down as a condition
that such things should not be printed without
consultation.

The editorial board is mocking us by infringing the
conditions. It is not surprising that for the same reasons
no confidence whatever is aroused by the letter of
Mikhalchi, who contradicts himself a hundred times in it.

The enquiry from the Riga workers (No. 24) is dated
January 19.[2] There was every possibility both of linking
it up with the article on Narodism in No. 17 (January 22)
and of sending it here in good time. I repeat that the
editorial board is making a mockery of the conditions laid
down. I insistently ask you, after those whom it concerns
have read this letter, immediately to pass it on to the
publisher of the newspaper, Deputy Badayev.

Yours faithfully,
 V. Ilyin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to Bogdanov’s letter to Pravda protesting at the
refusal of Pravda supporters to co-operate with the liquidators in the
nomination of a workers’ deputy to the Fourth Duma. In a note
to the letter the editors confined themselves to stating that
agreement had not been reached through the fault of the liquidators.





[2]
The enquiry from the Riga workers of January 19, 1913 was printed
in No. 24 of Pravda, January 30, 1913. The authors of the enquiry,
who signed themselves “A group of Narodnik workers and
Social-Democrat Readers of Pravda” asked the editors to state their
opinion on the question of “uniting with the Left Narodniks”. Lenin’s
article “On Narodism”, with which he wanted to link up this
enquiry, had been published in Nos. 16 and 17 of Pravda on January 
20 and 22, 1913 (see present edition, Vol. 18, pp. 524–28).

Today we have learned of the beginning of reform in
Dyen.[1] A thousand greetings, congratulations and wishes
for success. At long last you have managed to begin the
reform. You cannot imagine to what extent we have been
exhausted by working with a sullenly hostile editorial
board. Additional for Nos. 1 and
3[2]: we are surprised that
you could take offence or be displeased at the sharp letter
with the three-ruble note enclosed. All the sharpness was
directed precisely against those editors whom you happily
have begun to throw out. Sharpness against those who
should be thrown out, what is bad about that? Once again
we congratulate you on the beginning of the reform. The
letter by No. 3 in Dyen is magnificent, and the other letters
too. Reply whether you have received the draft of the Budget
speech. Send us as much material as possible. One cannot
work without it. The speech on the Budget could be
expanded to twice the size, if there were material. The statements
of the
numbers[3] are excellent. I congratulate them with
all my heart. Please repeat the second address for letters
to the students: we have some doubt about the name. Please
send us addresses for literature as soon as possible.

How about
No. 10[4]? Surely, as a pupil of A.,  he may
become a number. What is the circulation of Vechernaya
Pochta[5]? Did Jan’s comrades receive what he sent? Ask
No. 3. Warm greetings.

Dear A. M.,

Now, sir, what’s the meaning of this bad behaviour of
yours? You’re overworked, tired, your nerves are out of
order. This is all wrong. In Capri of all places, and in the
winter when there are probably less “visitors”, you ought
to have a regular way of life. You have no one to look
after you, is that why you have let yourself slide like this?
Honestly, it’s no good. Pull yourself together and give
yourself a stricter regime, really! Falling ill in limes like
these just isn’t allowed. Have you begun working at night?
Why, when I was in Capri, I was told that it was only
with my coming that things had got out of hand, while
before me everyone went to bed at the right time. You
must rest and establish a régime, without fail.

I will write to Troyanovsky and his wife about your
wish to meet them. This would be a really good thing. They
are good people. We haven’t seen much of them at work yet,
but everything we have heard up to now speaks in their
favour. They also have money. They might get into their
stride and do a great deal for the journal. Troyanovskaya
is going to Russia soon.

It is a great joy to me, and to all of us, that you are taking
up Prosveshcheniye. I confess that I did have the thought!
now as soon as I write about our little journal, A. M. will
lose his enthusiasm. I repent, I repent of such thoughts.

Now it really will be splendid if little by little we draw
in fiction writers and set Prosveshcheniye going! Excellent!
The reader is new, proletarian; we shall make the journal
cheap; you will let in only democratic fiction, without

    

moaning, without renegade stuff. We shall consolidate
the workers. And the workers now are fine. Our six deputies
in the Duma from the worker curia have now begun to work
outside the Duma so energetically that it is a joy to see.
This is where people will build up a real workers party!
We were never able to bring this off in the Third Duma.
Have you seen the letter in Luch (No. 24) from the four
deputies about their
resignation?[1] A good letter, wasn’t it?

And have you seen in Pravda how mildly Alexinsky is
writing, and so far not making a row? Wonderful! He sent
one “Manifesto” (why he entered Pravda). They didn’t
print it. And still, so far, he is not making a row.
Wonder–ful! But Bogdanov is making a row: a piece of
exceptional stupidity in Pravda No. 24. No, we shall never gel
anywhere with him! I have read his Engineer Mannie. It’s
the same old Machism = idealism, so concealed that neither
the workers nor the stupid editors of Pravda understood
it. No, this Machist is as hopeless as Lunacharsky (thanks
for his article). If only Lunacharsky could be separated
from Bogdanov in aesthetics, as Alexinsky has begun to
draw apart from him in politics ... if only...

As regards the theory of matter and its structure, I am
fully in agreement with you that one should write about it,
and that it is a good remedy against “the poison which the
shapeless Russian soul is sucking”. Only you are wrong
to call this poison “metaphysics”. It ought to be called
idealism and agnosticism.

For the Machists call materialism metaphysics! And it
so happens that a host of the most prominent present-day
physicists, on the occasion of the “wonders” of radium,
electrons, etc., are smuggling in the God business—both the
crudest and the most subtle—in the shape of philosophical
idealism.

As regards nationalism I am fully in agreement with you
that we ought to take this up more seriously. We have a
marvellous Georgian who has sat down to write a big
article for Prosveshcheniye, for which he has collected all the
Austrian and other
materials.[2] We shall go at this hard.
But that our resolutions (I am sending them in printed form)
“are formalities, bureaucracy”, there your abuse is off
target. No. It’s not a formality. In Russia and in the

    

Caucasus the Georgian + Armenian + Tartar + Russian
Social-Democrats have worked together, in a single
Social-Democratic organisation for more than ten years. This is not
a phrase, but the proletarian solution of the problem of
nationalities. The only solution. So it was in Riga too:
Russians + Letts + Lithuanians. Only the separatists—the
Bund—used to stand aloof. The same at Vilna.

There are two good Social-Democratic pamphlets on the
nationalities problem: Strasser and Pannekoek. Would
you like me to send them to you? Will you find anyone to
translate them from the German for you?

No, the disgusting situation that exists in Austria won’t
happen here. We won’t allow it! And there are more of
our Great Russians here. With the workers on our side we
won’t let in any of the “Austrian spirit”.

As regards
Pyatnitsky,[3] I am for prosecution. There
is no need to stand on ceremony. Sentimentalism would
be unforgivable. Socialists are not at all against use of
the slate court. We are for making use of legality. Marx
and Bebel made use of the stale court even against their
socialist opponents. One must know how to do it, but it
must be done.

Pyatnitsky must be prosecuted, and no nonsense. If you
hear reproaches against you for this—spit in the mugs of
those who make them. It is the hypocrites who will reproach
you. To give way to Pyatnitsky, to let him off for fear of
going to court, would be unforgivable.

Well, I have chattered more than enough. Write and
tell me about your health.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. We know Foma-Piterets. He is now at Narym.
Foma from the Urals? We don’t seem to remember him.
At the Congress of 1907 there was a Foma-Piterets.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the following letter from the Bolshevik deputies in
the Fourth Duma—A. Y. Badayev, G. I. Petrovsky, F. N.
Samoilov and N. R. Shagov—on their resignation from the liquidators’
newspaper Luch: “On December 18, 1912, we, in accordance with

__PRINTERS_P_563_COMMENT__
37—01148

   

the wishes of the Social-Democratic group of December 15,
accepted the proposal of the newspaper Luch that we should be included
among its contributors.

“Since then more than a month has passed. In all this time
Luch has acted in constant and rabid opposition to anti–
liquidationism. We consider its advocacy of an ‘open’ workers’ party
and its attacks on the underground, in the present conditions of
Russian life, impermissible and harmful.

“Since we find it impossible to allow our names to be used as a
cover for the liquidationist views advocated by Luch we request
the editors to remove us from the list of its contributors” (Luch
No. 24, January 30, 1913).





[2]
Lenin refers to J. V. Stalin’s writing of the article “The
Nationalities Problem and Social-Democracy”.





[3]
Gorky suspected dishonesty on the part of K. P. Pyatnitsky, the
managing director of the St. Petersburg publishing firm Znaniye
(Knowledge). The matter was never actually taken to court.

Dear Colleagues,

Let me first of all congratulate you on the vast
improvement in the whole conduct of the paper which has become
apparent during the last few days. I want to congratulate
you and to wish you further successes in the same direction.
The day before yesterday I sent the first two short articles
entitled “An Increasing
Discrepancy”.[1]

From No. 234
of Pravda I see clearly that these articles will not be
suitable. Therefore please pass them over without delay to
Prosveshcheniye, to which I am sending the final section.
Please pass over to them also the other articles which have
not been printed (the reply to Mayevsky; on morality;
Bulgakov on the
peasants[2]—Bulgakov’s articles from
Russkya Mysl, etc.). Please be sure to reply as soon as
possible whether you have done this. Send me Nos. 7, 8,
21 and 24 of Luch and No. 25 of Pravda. I had always been
getting Pravda until lately in the mornings, as I do Rech
and Novoye Vremya. But for the last week Pravda has
begun to come late, and arrives only in the evenings.
Clearly the dispatch department is working carelessly. I
earnestly request you to take steps to see that, they display
greater care with the daily post.

I receive no new books at all. Steps must be taken
(a) to
get them from the publishers on a deposit account,
(b) to
get the Duma arid official publications through the deputies.
It is absolutely impossible to work without books.... I don’t
receive either Zavety or Russkaya
Molva.[3] I can’t get on

    

without them. I particularly need the issue of Russkaya
Molva where they wrote about Luch and explained that the
Mensheviks are against underground work.

March 1 (14) will be the 30th anniversary of the death
of Marx. You ought to publish a supplement for two or
three kopeks, four pages in Pravda formal with a big
portrait of Marx and a number of small
articles.[4] There
should also be detailed advertisements both for Pravda
and Prosveshcheniye. Probably it would pay for itself with
a circulation of 25–30 thousand, and make a profit. If you
agree, cable me: “Draw up” (we shall then sit down to
write), then, in addition, send a more detailed reply. Reply
please, two or three times a week in a few lines, about what
articles you have received and which will be printed.

In my opinion you were quite right to publish Dnevnitsky
in full, as a first step. But for the future it would be better
to hold up such long (and bad) articles, and to begin
correspondence about passing them over to Prosveshcheniye.

Yours,
 I.

  For Vetrov
   Urgent

Dear Colleague,

It is extremely sad that our correspondence is still not
properly organised, that I still have no special address
for you personally, that yon don’t reply to my questions
for so long.
(1) I wrote to you a very, very long time ago
that Zvezda still had, in addition to the article “Debates
in Britain on Liberal Labour Policy”, the articles “Two
Utopias”[1]

and a criticism of the boycott policy (against
Amfiteatrov, I don’t remember the
title[3]). I repeat what
I asked: get hold of them and send them to me. I hope to
make use of them.
(2) At Pravda there are also a number
of articles which have not been used there. I very much
want, you to find them and make them into notes of a
publicist signed, say, T.... The approximate arrangement would
be:
I. Reply to Mayevsky (in Luch, about liquidationism).
(This subject is the more necessary because Dnevnitsky
and Plekhanov, in No. 234 of Pravda, have struck false
notes.)
II. Bulgakov in Russkaya Mysl on the peasants
(I don’t remember the title).
III. On morality (two short
articles).
IV. “An Increasing Discrepancy” (on the February
1913 conference of the Cadets. We must react to this. Two
short articles were sent to Pravda the day before yesterday;
the
remaning four are small, I am sending them today).
The titles for these paragraphs should not be in large type
(as was clone in the article “Results of the
Elections”[2]

in No. 1 of Prosveshcheniye) but in small point.
 

There are an awful lot of misprints in No. 1 of 
Prosveshcheniye....
I enclose the corrected proofs of the article “Debates
in Britain on Liberal Labour Policy”. It should be printed.
Have yon really not managed to get rid yet of Mikhalchi....
This is essential, I assure you, essential. I have seen a
misprint on page 26 of Prosveshcheniye No. 1. A correction in
print is absolutely necessary. I enclose the correction.

V. Il.

Misprint

Many misprints occurred in the January number of
Prosveshcheniye (1913, No. 1). We correct one which distorts
the sense. On page 26, line 23 from the top, it reads: “25 per
cent in the workers’ party”, but should read “52 per cent”.

Dear L. B.,

I am sending you Poletayev’s letter (return it
immediately) and a short article (also to be
returned)....[1]


I have read Current Topics. What scoundrels! But, we
don’t know whether to attack or keep silent about these
young pigs. Is it really worth pitching into them now?
What is your opinion?

My view is that they ought to he hammered a little, but
not too much, in the next issue of the
C.O.[3]

Your report, seems to have turned out wonderfully well__

A thousand greetings!

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Good news from Petersburg, Moscow Region and
the South. The workers’ illegal organisation is growing
and taking shape. A reform of Pravda has begun.

Troyanowsky is starting something like an intrigue on
account of Koba’s article for Prosveshcheniye: “The
Problem of Nationalities and Social-Democracy”. He wants
it to be stated that the article is for discussion, because
Galina is for cultural-national autonomy!!

Of course we are absolutely against. The article is a
very good one. It’s a burning question, and we shall not
give up one iota of our attitude in principle against the
Bundist rabble.
 

It may “blow over”, but ... tenez vous pour
averti![2]


We have decided to attack the Vperyodists. Get Miron
to write whether there is enough money for four pages of
the C.O.

Have you read “The Meteor” in Russkoye Bogatstvo?
What is it? A lampoon?

Sotsial-Demokrat (Social-Democrat)—central organ of the

to January 1917. Lenin was virtually in charge of the paper, which
printed more than 80 of his articles and short items. During the
period of reaction (1907–10) and the subsequent revolutionary
revival Sotsial-Demokrat was of enormous significance in the
Bolsheviks’ campaign against the liquidators, Trotskyists and otzovists,
for the preservation of the illegal Marxist party and
strengthening of its ties with the masses.

Dear A. M.,

I have read the
“Manifesto”[1] today....

It seems there is a complete amnesty for writers. You
should try to get hack—having first found out, of course,
whether they won’t play you a dirty trick on account of the
“school”,[2] etc. Probably they won’t be able to prosecute
you for this.

I hope you don’t take the view that one mustn’t “accept”
an amnesty? This would he wrong. A revolutionary, as
things are today, will do more from inside Russia, and our
deputies even sign “the solemn oath”.

But you don’t have to sign anything, only to make use
of the amnesty. Drop me a line about your opinion and
your plans. Perhaps you will call here it you do move—
after all, it’s on your way!

And for a revolutionary writer to have the possibility
of roaming around Russia (the new Russia) means that he
is afterwards able to hit a hundred limes harder at the
Romanovs and Co....

Did you get my last letter? Somehow we haven’t had
news from you for a long time. Are you well?

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Did you get the letter from N. K. with the material?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The “Manifesto” referred to is the amnesty decree promulgated
in connection with the 300th anniversary of the House of the
Romanovs.





[2]
Reference is to a school on Capri organised by the Vperyod group
in 1909 with Gorky’s participation.

Dear L. B.,

I received your letter today
and ...[1]

from the report
on the Third Duma group. Thanks. I passed it on today
to Malinovsky, who is here; ... is leaving today....

It’s strange, very strange indeed, about Dan! He lives
quite freely, goes to the group, is the editor of Luch, etc.!!
The secret police are playing some big game here!

There are heavy arrests at home. Koba has been arrested.
We have discussed with Malinovsky what measures to take.
The circulation of Pravda is 30–32 thousand on week-days
and 40–42 thousand on holidays. There is a general cry
that we haven’t the people. The liquidators have a mass
of intellectuals, while all ours get arrested.

It’s been decided “in principle” to abolish the extra
sheets and to publish weekly supplements to Pravda, for
an extra payment, of 4–8--12 pages (in place of Zvezda);
it would be a good thing if successful—but the lack of
people is a hindrance.

The Six get on very well together, but complain that it’s
hard going....

All the “intelligentsia” are with the liquidators. The mass
of the workers are with us (40,000 Pravda, against 12,000
Luck) but the workers are producing their own intelligentsia
with the greatest difficulty. Slowly and with difficulty.

Party affairs in Russia in general are obviously
improving. Workers’ circles, groups and organisations are obviously
developing
everyhwere and growing stronger. Expanding.
And the Urals and the South and Moscow Region (
particularly). In the Caucasus there is an improvement (latest
information is that there are arrests again)....
 

There is an undoubted revival in the Social-Democratic
movement. Once again people have begun to give (a little)
money. News! There are signs of a revival of revolutionary
organisations in the forces. But the tempo of the movement
is different somehow, new in some way.

You have, of course, noticed Plekhanov in Pravda? Had
his fling and ... returned. What a wobbler he is! Helped
Mayevsky[2] (after January 1912)—then abandoned him
(August 1912)—was mercilessly attacked by him—now
attacks him in turn!! Kiselyov has sent me a long letter,
reproaching me for keeping down the pro-Party Mensheviks,
of whom I am supposed to be unwarrantedly demanding
that they should be “Leninists”. The man’s a crank! But
Gr—y thinks this is a “move” by Plekhanov....

Something new in the history of intrigue: K. Radek
has put out a pamphlet Meine Abrechnung, against Tyszka,
gave him a terrific lambasting. They have promised to
send you a copy too.

I have read Rosa’s new book Die Akkumulation des
Kapitals. She has got into a shocking muddle. She has distorted
Marx. I am very glad that Pannekoek and Eckstein and
0. Bauer have all with one accord condemned her, and said
against her what I said in 1899 against the Narodniks.
I intend to write about Rosa for No. 4 of
Prosveshcheniye.[3]

Koba had time to write a big article on the nationalities
problem (for three issues of Prosveshcheniye). Good! We
must fight for the truth against the separatists and
opportunists of the Bund and among the liquidators.

There is a certain moving of the waters towards Russia:
there are more leaving foreign parts to work at home than
before.

Trotsky, they say, is offended with Luch.

But I must close. Warm regards from Malinovsky and
us all. All the best.

Vonrs, Lenin

In March and April 1913 Lenin was working on an article to be
called “Rosa Luxemburg’s Unsuccessful Addition to Marxist
Theory”. He drew up a plan of the article, compiled statistical tables
and copied quotations from Marx’s Capital, but the article was
never published.

   For IV. Iv.

Dear Comrades,

Many thanks for your detailed letter and very valuable
information. Write more often, and give us contacts with
the districts.

It is very important that the liquidators are giving a
“hostile” reception to the rapprochement of the pro-Party
Mensheviks with the Party. A resolution about this ought
to be adopted in the districts. This fact proves for the 1,000th
time that the liquidators have finally become a non-Party
and anti-Party element, that unity is possible only against
them (against Luch) and by no means with them. You
are quite right, in my belief, in attributing great
importance to this fact. One can’t in any way talk about unity
with the liquidators: one cannot unite the Party with the
destroyers of the Party. The resolution of the February
Conference of 1913 about unity from below, it seems to me,
should be hectographed (if there are not enough copies),
adding the resolution against Luch with the precise list
of the five
points.[1]

Furthermore, I fully share your opinion about the
importance of a campaign against the
Seven,[2] and of the workers
displaying initiative in this respect. The Seven are
wavering and near-Party, but to a very little extent Party people.
One can enter into agreements with them within the Duma,
in order to direct them and drag them after oneself, but it
would be a crime to gloss over their liquidationism, their
lack of character and principle. We must support and

    

develop the campaign against the Seven. Now that the
liquidators’ Luch is expanding (obviously on liberals’ money,
because its deficit is 1,000 rubles a month, and its
circulation is only 12,000) we must strengthen tenfold the
campaign to support the six workers’ deputies, to increase
Pravda’s readership, to extend Pravda. We must take the
struggle for Pravda direct into the factories, pressing them
to subscribe for more copies, winning away every factory
from Luck, so that there is a competition between the
factories for the largest number of subscribers to Pravda. A
victory of Party principles is a victory for Pravda and vice
versa. We should start this kind of campaign: to increase
the circulation of Pravda from 30,000 to 50,000–00,000,
and the number of subscribers from 5,000 to 20,000, and
proceed unfalteringly in this direction. Then we shall
extend and improve Pravda.

Your remarks about the lack of intellectuals are very
true. And we won’t have them. Pravda and the illegal
publications will replace them. You should publish at least
hectographed resolutions and leaflets until more is
technically possible. There should be a weekly publication of 30–00
copies of hectographed resolutions of the Petersburg
Committee by way of directives. We could always come to an
agreement by correspondence about these resolutions. Think
this over. It will strengthen the illegal work, reduce the
number of victims, make the propaganda more general,
etc.

The resolution of the Petersburg Committee for the Six
against the Seven is
excellent.[3] Haven’t you even
hectographed it? This is absolutely essential. Now this is just
the kind of campaign that is necessary. We shall try to
send you articles for
Izvestia.[4] Let us know the dates.
Tell us what the size will be, and what the length of the
articles should be.

L. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the resolution “The Attitude to Liquidationism, and
Unity” passed at the “February” Conference of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. and Party workers held in Cracow from December 26,
1912 to January 1, 1913 (January 8–14, 1913) (see present edition,
Vol. 18, pp. 463–65).





[2]
The Seven were the seven Menshevik liquidator deputies who
belonged to the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma.





[3]
Reference is to the resolution of the Petersburg Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. passed in February 1913. The resolution noted the
correctness of the political line maintained by the Bolshevik
deputies in the Fourth Duma and condemned the conduct of the
Menshevik deputies supporting the liquidators’ paper Luch.





[4]
At a meeting in February 1913 the Petersburg Committee took a
decision to publish Izvestia P.K. R.S.D.R.P. (News of the P.C.
of the R.S.D.L.P.) and planned the first issue. The project did
not materialise.

Dear A. M.,

How do you stand about a little article or a story for
the May issue of Prosveshcheniye? They write to me from
there that they could publish 10–15 thousand (that’s how we
are marching ahead!), if there were something from you.
Drop me a line whether there will
be.[1] Then Pravda
reprints it, and we get 40,000 readers. Yes ... the affairs of
Prosveshcheniye could begin to prosper; otherwise there
does not exist, devil take it, a single consistent journal
for the workers, for the Social-Democrats, for revolutionary
democracy; nothing but rotten sour-pusses of one kind
or another.

How is your health? Have you rested, and will you be
taking a rest in the summer? It is essential, my word on
it, that you should have a good rest!

Things are not too well with me. The wife is down with
goitre. Nerves! My nerves are also playing me up a little.
We are spending the summer in the village of Poronin,
near Zakopane. (My address is: Herrn Wl. Ulianow, Poronin,
Galizien, Austria.) It’s a good place, and healthy. Height
about 700 metres. Suppose you took it into your head to
pay us a visit? There will be interesting workers from Russia.
Zakopane (seven versts from us) is a well-known health
resort.

Have you seen Demyan Bedny’s
Fables?[2] I will send
them if you haven’t. If you have, write and say what
you think of them.
 

Do you get Pravda and Luch regularly? Our cause is
going ahead—in spite of everything—and the workers’ party
is being built up as a revolutionary Social-Democratic party,
against the liberal renegades, the liquidators. We shall
have cause to celebrate one day. We are rejoicing just now
at the victory of the workers in Petersburg over the
liquidators when the Board of the new Metalworkers’
Union[3]
was elected.

And “your” Lunacharsky is a line one!! Oh, what a fine
fellow! Maeterlinck, he says, has “scientific mysticism”....
Or Lunacharsky and Bogdanov are perhaps no longer yours?

Joking apart. Keep well. Send me a couple of words.

Rest as well as you can.

Yours,
 Lenin

Ulianow, Austria. Poronin (Galizien).

How  did  you find   the  jubilee  number  of
Pravda?[4]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the May 1913 issue of Prosveshcheniye there are no works by
Gorky, but the June issue contains his story “Krazha” (“The
Theft”).





[2]
Bedny, Demyan (Pridvorov, Y. A.) (1883–1945)—outstanding
Soviet poet, joined the Bolshevik Party in 1912. In 1911 he had begun
contributing to the Bolshevik newspapers Zvezda and Pravda. His
poems and fables were fired with the spirit of the class struggle
against the capitalist system and its defenders. During the period
of foreign intervention and civil war Bedny went to the front as a
poet-agitator.





[3]
The elections of the Board of the Petersburg Metalworkers’ Union
took place on April 21 (May 4), 1913. The meeting was attended by
nearly 800 people and another 400 were unable to get in because
there was no room. The Bolsheviks submitted a list of candidates
for the Board that had been published in Pravda No. 91 and was
distributed among those present. Despite the liquidators’ demand
that candidates should be elected “irrespective of trend”, the
majority of the meeting voted for the Pravda list; 10 out of the
14 successful candidates for the Board were Pravda nominees.

[4]
Reference is to Pravda No. 92, April 23, 1913, which contained
Lenin’s articles “Anniversary of Pravda” and “A Few Words on
Results and Facts”.

Dear Colleagues,

Today at last I have received the file of Pravda for the
last few days or, more precisely, for the last week. My best
thanks and best congratulations on your success: in my
opinion the paper has now undoubtedly found its feet.
The improvement is a tremendous one and a serious one,
and, let us hope, firm and for good. The length of
Plekhanov’s articles and the abundance of anti-liquidationism
(about which one of the workers’ deputies writes to me) are
now questions of detail; it won’t be difficult to correct
matters in Ibis respect, now that the paper has taken a firm
stand, and I think that the workers on the spot will see at
once bow to make the necessary correction. We have also
received the detailed letter of a member of the staff (who
unfortunately has not the pleasant “deputy” quality), and
we were very glad of it, congratulating him on every kind
of success. It seems as though now (and only now, after
the
St—v[1]

adventure) the period of wavering has ended ...
touch wood!...

I don’t advise you to present Plekhanov with ultimatums:
it is too early, it may do harm!! If you do write to him,
write as kindly and mildly as possible, He is valuable
now because he is fighting the enemies of the working-class
movement.

As regards Demyan Bedny, I continue to be for. Don’t
find fault, friends, with human failings! Talent is rare.
It should be systematically and carefully supported. It
will be a sin on your conscience, a great sin (a hundred

    

times bigger than various personal “sins”, if such occur...)
against the democratic working-class movement, if you
don’t draw in this talented contributor and don’t help
him. The disputes were petty, the cause is a serious one.
Think over this!

As regards expansion, I have recently written in detail
to one of the Prosveshcheniye people; I hope you also have
seen the letter. I, too, am in favour of financial caution:
to provide the same six pages (the present extra sheets) in
another form, with a different sauce and title and content:
4 pages of Sunday supplement for the advanced workers + 2
pages of a “workers’ kopek” for 1 kopek, for the masses,
to win a hundred thousand readers, with an especially
popular content. You shouldn’t imitate Luch but go your
own road, the proletarian road: 4 pages for the advanced
workers and 2pages (and later even 4)
for the masses, for a
long and stubborn battle for 100,000 readers. We must go
wide and deep, into the masses, and not follow intellectual
patterns like Luch.

Once again greetings, congratulations and best wishes.

Yours,
 V. I.

Another special greeting to Vitimsky: his article about
the workers’ press and workers’ democracy against
the
liberals[2] was very successful!! And the Bogdanov “Ideology”
is certain to heresy: I promise you that I will prove this
exactly!![3]

Marxists are glad of an increase in circulation when it
is increased by Marxist articles, and not by articles against
Marxism. We want a principled paper—all the contributors
and readers of Pravda want it—a Marxist, not Machist
paper? Isn’t that so?

P.S. The address is not Paronen, but Poronin (Galizien),
and be sure to add on the wrapper: via Warsaw-Frontier–
Zakopane.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Who this refers to has not been established.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin refers to the article by M. S. Olminsky (A. Vitimsky) “Kto s
kem?” (“Who Is on Whose Side?”), published in Pravda No. 106,
May 10, 1913. The article was part of the polemic with Luch
concerning the conference between the editors of bourgeois
publications and representatives of the workers’ press. The conference
was called for the purpose of protesting at the introduction of
harsher laws against the press. The chairman of the conference did
not allow a vote on the draft resolution submitted by the Pravda
representatives. They and representatives of a number of trade
union papers refused to sign the liberal editors’ resolution.
Besides the representatives of Rech, Russkaya Molva, Sovremennoye
Slovo and Dyen, etc., =

only the representatives of Luch and Nasha
Zarya signed the resolution, thus acting against the workers’
papers represented at the conference.





[3]
On Lenin’s insistence A. A. Bogdanov’s article “Ideology” (from
the “Dictionary of Foreign Words” series) was rejected by Pravda
as anti-Marxist. Concerning the statement which Bogdanov then
sent to Pravda announcing his resignation from the paper, Lenin
wrote a “Letter to the Editor” which was published in the
newspaper Put Pravdy No. 9, January 31, 1914 =

(see present edition, Vol. 
20, pp. 93–94).

Dear Friends,

In our opinion you made a mistake in tying yourselves
up with
Fyodor.[1] Probably nothing but squabbles will
come of it. You should have published your own
report.[2]
But now we have to start from what has already been done.
In the present situation it is essential to insist above all
on complete equality, and at the very outset to move a formal
resolution, approximately in this form: “The
co-operative[3]
resolves that in drawing up the report no majority decision
of one wing over another is allowed, and both wings (the
Six and the Seven) enjoy complete equality in all respects,
i.e., the commission is set up on a parity basis, and disputed
passages are edited by agreement, and not by a majority
decision. If speeches of the deputies are printed at the end
of the report, the selection of the speeches also is to be by
agreement.”
This resolution is essential. Otherwise they
will set up a commission on the basis of equality, and then
the co-operative, by a majority of one, will endorse what
the liquidator proposes. If Feodora rejects such a resolution,
we recommend you officially to declare that, in view of their
unwillingness to agree to equality, you reserve complete
freedom] of action. Even so, you can still put forward your
own candidate.

We append the first rough draft of the theses:
1) The election campaign. The circumstances in which
it takes place. Its results for the Social-Democrats. The
platform of the Social-Democrats: the 8–hour day,
confiscation of the land, complete democratisation.
 

2) The composition of the Social-Democratic group. How
it was set up. The Jagiello

case.[4] (Exposition of the points
of view of the Six and the Seven. Indication of protests
made.)

3) The political platform of the group and its first speeches.
The declaration. Indicate that the Six reject cultural–
national autonomy. Indicate dial wide sections of the workers
have approved precisely ... the watchwords in the
declaration. An outline of the political position of the
Social-Democrats.

The main watchwords are still: the 8–hour day, transfer
of the land, complete democratisation.

4) Questions put down by the group.

5) The group and the Budget.

6) The bourgeois groups in the Duma and sharp criticism
of them and of the liberals (the speeches by Maklakov, the
Octobrists,[5] the Black
Hundreds[6]).

7) The workers and the group. Their instructions, appeals,
reactions, material for questions, mutual aid in cash, etc.

8)  Immunity of the deputies (the case of
Petrovsky[7]).

Internal differences: each side puts forward its own point
of view, with an equal number of pages to each. Statements
made by each side to the press are reprinted. A list of
workers’ resolutions, as many as there are. The supplement.
Most important tasks.

We await your news. Apartments have been
taken.[8]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Fyodor (Feodora)—cover name for the Menshevik section of the
Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma.





[2]
Lenin means a report on the activity of the Social-Democratic
group in the Fourth Duma. No such report had been published.





[3]

“The co-operative” was the cover name for the Social-Democratic
group in the Fourth Duma.





[4]
Lenin refers to the controversy over the right of J. I. Jagiello, the
deputy to the Fourth Duma for Warsaw, to belong to the
Social-Democratic group.





[5]
Octobrists or Union of October Seventeen—counter-revolutionary
party of the big industrial bourgeoisie and big landowners who
ran their estates on capitalist lines. It was founded after
publication of the tsar’s manifesto of October 17, 1905, in which the tsar,
frightened by the revolution, promised the people “civil rights”
and a constitution. The Octobrists unreservedly supported the
home and foreign policy of the tsarist government. Their leaders
were A. Guchkov, the powerful industrialist, and M. Rodzyanko,
who owned huge estates.





[6]
The Black Hundreds—bands of monarchists organised by the
tsarist police to fight the revolutionary movement. These bands
murdered revolutionaries, attacked progressive intellectuals and
staged pogroms against the Jews.





[7]
Reference is to the arrest of Y. M. Sverdlov and K. T.
Novgorodtseva (Sverdlova) at the apartment of G. I. Petrovsky, a member
of the Fourth Duma, on February 10 (23), 1913. They wore given
away to the police by the agent provocateur R. V. Malinovsky.





[8]
Lenin refers to accommodation for the Party school which the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. was planning to organise at Poronin.

Dear Georgy Valentinovich,

At the request of the six Social-Democratic deputies
I invite you to come for a few weeks to Zakopane in the
summer to deliver lectures on such questions of Marxism
and the Social-Democratic movement as yon may select.
We have heard today from Petersburg that it is also possible
that four deputies may come who support the liquidators
or who are wavering (Buryanov, Tulyakov, Khaustov and
maybe even Mankov). As Mensheviks, they naturally
attribute particular importance to the question of your
participation.

On our part, we should think it very useful that Party
people of various views should take part in an enterprise
which seems to us extremely important for strengthening
connections with the workers and reinforcing Party work.

In view of the conspirative nature of the case, we have
decided not to tell a single group abroad about the plan
to organise these lectures—all the more so because the
deputies would probably be in peril of particularly severe
penalties.

Poronin, where it is proposed to hold the lectures, is
seven kilometres by rail from Zakopane—one of the best
mountain health resorts in Galicia. As to the financial

    

side (travelling expenses), we can come to a special
arrangement by correspondence, if required.

Please write whether you agree to this proposition.

Yours faithfully,
 N. Lenin

My address is: Herrn Wl. Ulianow.
 Poronin (Galizien). Autriche.

Dear Al. Max.,

We have had a letter today from Petersburg that our
plan for a visit of the Social-Democratic deputies here is
close to fulfilment (extra-conspiratively: it has been decided
not to say a word to anyone except you). In addition to
the six supporters of Pravda it is possible, they write, that
Tulyakov, Buryanov, Khaustov and even, maybe, Mankov
may come. Probably they will manage to draw in some
of the workers as well (non-deputies). Write, please, whether
you could come (for a number of lectures, or talks, or classes,
just as you please). It would be a fine thing! Seven kilometres
from here by rail is Zakopane, a very good health resort.
As regards money for the journey, we shall raise it, in all
probability (so they write). We can collect and send you all
the information about Zakopane as a health resort.

If your health permits, do come for a short time! You
would meet more workers, after the ones at
London[1] and
the Capri school.

Malinovsky wanted to visit you but didn’t manage it,
he was short of time. He and all the deputies send you
warm greetings.

I await your reply.

Yours,
 Lenin

The newspapers are full of reports about the
“conflict”.[2]
I think they are going to stifle Pravda for us. Maklakov
will bring this off one way or another—by-passing the

    

Duma, against, the Duma or in some other way, but bring
it off he
will![3]

In that case we shall turn again to illegal literature—
but we have no money.

Hasn’t the “merchant” begun to contribute yet? It is
time, just the right time.

Address: Herrn Wl. Ulianow. Poronin (Galizien)
Autriche.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Gorky had been a delegate to the Fifth (London) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., which took place from April 30 to May 19 (May 13
to June 1), 1907.





[2]
The conflict was between the Fourth Duma and the government,
in connection with a speech by the Black Hundred deputy Markov II
who had said with reference to a representative of the Ministry
of Finance “there must be no stealing”. The Duma had not reacted
in any way to the statement. The Cabinet, considering this an
insult to the whole government, insisted that Markov II should be
prosecuted for slander and demanded that Rodzyanko, Chairman
of the Fourth Duma, should make a public statement condemning
Markov’s speech.





[3]
Pravda was banned on July 5 (18), 1913 by decree of the St. 
Petersburg Chamber of Justice on the proposal of N. A. Maklakov,
Minister of the Interior. On July 13 (26) of the same year it resumed
publication under the new name of Rabochaya Pravda (Workers’
Truth).

July 25, 1913

Dear A. M.,

I have kept on intending to write to you, and then
pulling it off on account of my wife’s operation. The other
day at last the operation look place, and things are now on
the mend. The operation proved a rather difficult one: I
am very glad indeed that we managed to get Kocher to
operate.

Now to business. You wrote that you would be in Berlin
in August. When in August? At the beginning or at the end?
We intend to leave here on August 4. Our tickets lake us
through Zurich, Munich and Vienna, and we shall break the
journey in each of these cities. (Possibly the doctor will
not let us leave so soon as the 4th: in that case we shall
postpone it again.)

Couldn’t we see each other somewhere? In all probability
it would suit you to travel through Berne, or through
Zurich, or through Munich, wouldn’t it?

There is great need for us to meet. The closing down of
Pravda creates a devilishly difficult situation. Perhaps
we could think of something. Then in Berlin you could do
a very great deal for us, i.e., for Pravda.

Therefore I beg you to write immediately, be it only
two words, whether our meeting is possible, either here or
in the places mentioned, at the beginning of August? If it
is impossible, I will write to you about everything in greater
detail, particularly about the school (the arrest of the

    

organiser[1]

has spoilt things for us damnably; we are looking
for another).

I shake your hand warmly and wish you the best of luck,
and most of all health for the journey. So reply at once!

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

I found your letter on my return home. Be sure and send
as much material as you can about, the nationalities
problem in the Caucasus (since you, unfortunately, cannot
write yourself), send us both the article by Kostrov and his
booklets, reports by the delegates translated into Russian
(I hope you will find someone to do this), statistics of
nationalities in the Caucasus and material on the relations between
the nationalities in the Caucasus, in Persia, Turkey and
Russia. In a word, send everything there is and that you
can collect. Don’t forget also to look for comrades in the
Caucasus who could write articles about the problem of
nationalities there.

Greetings and wishes for
success.[2]

Yours,
 V. Ilyich
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Shahumyan, S. G. (1878–1918)—outstanding figure in the
Communist Party and the Soviet state. Joined the R.S.D.L.P. in 1900.
From 1904 to 1910 he was one of the leaders of Party work in the
Transcaucasus and one of the organisers and editors of Bolshevik
legal and illegal publications. An active opponent of the
Mensheviks. He was co-opted as an alternative member for the Central
Committee by the Central Committee which had been elected by
the Sixth (Prague) Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. While exiled to
Astrakhan (1911–14), he wrote, on Lenin’s instructions, the work
National-Cultural Autonomy, in which he upheld the principles of
proletarian internationalism. On his return from exile in 1914 he
became leader of the Baku Bolshevik organisation.





[2]
In reply to this letter Lenin received a letter from S. G.
Shahumyan written on September 7, 1913 in Astrakhan. Shahumyan wrote
that later he would send statistics of nationalities in the

   

Caucasus, and gave the following provisional figures—5 million Moslems, 2
million Armenians and 2 million Georgians. Concerning the distribution of
nationalities in uyezds, gubernias and the cities—Tiflis, Baku, Batum,
Elisavetpol, etc., he suggested using the Caucasian Calendar. He
also sent the pamphlet he had promised and a translation of two reports on
Armenian affairs.

you very much for sending me Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta:
only No. 7 is missing, and also Nos. 7 and 9 of

Please send them.

It seems to me that yon are making a gigantic mistake
in drifting unconsciously with the stream and not changing
the tone of the paper. Everything suggests that both the
tone and the content of the news section must he changed.
It is essential to achieve legality, ability to pass the censor.
This can and must be achieved. Otherwise yon are
destroying, for no reason at all, the work you have undertaken.
Think this over more seriously.

September 30, 1913

Dear A. M.,

This reply has been delayed a little. Sorry. How devilishly
furious I was in Berne, and later!! I thought: if you were
in Verona (the telegram from you about Bebel was from
Verona)—or in some
Rom...[2]?? Why, I could have come
to Verona from Berne!! But from you at that time there was
not a sound for months....

What you write about your illness worries me terribly.
Are you doing the right thing in living without treatment
at Capri? The Germans have excellent sanatoria (for
example, at St. Blasien, near Switzerland) where they treat and
completely cure lung diseases, achieve complete healing,
feed you up, then systematically accustom you to cold,
harden you against catching cold, and turn out fit people,
able to work.

While you, after Capri, and in winter, want to go to
Russia???? I am terribly afraid that this will injure your
health and undermine your working capacity. Are there
first-class doctors in that Italy of yours??

Really, go and visit some first-class doctor in
Switzerland[1]

or Germany, and set about a couple of months of serious
treatment in a good sanatorium. Because to squander official
property, i.e., to go on being ill and undermining your
working capacity, is something quite intolerable in every
respect.

I have heard (from the editor of Prosveshcheniye, who
saw Ladyzhnikov) that you are dissatisfied with Pravda.

    

Because it’s dry? That is true. But it’s not easy to correct
this defect all at once. We haven’t the people. With great
difficulty, one year after it started, we secured a merely
tolerable editorial board in Petersburg.

(I have forwarded your letter to Prosveshcheniye.)

Write what your plans are, and what your health is like.
I earnestly ask you to set about your treatment seriously—
really, it is quite possible to be cured, and to let it go on
is simply outrageous and criminal.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Some of the people we have had here, and some we
shall have, are good. And have you seen “Nash Put”? What
a success, eh? Our second paper. We shall start a third,
too, in the South.

Address: Ulianow. Poronin (Galizien). Austria. (During
the winter I shall be in Cracow: Lubomirskiego. 51.)

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you very much for twice sending the newspaper
in time, i.e., simultaneously with all the bourgeois papers.
But apart from these two occasions, Za Pravdu always
comes half a day later than the bourgeois papers. Can’t
this be altered, and the paper always be sent at the proper
time, so that it comes at the same time as the bourgeois
press?

Best greetings!

Yours,
Lenin

P.S. What is the circulation now? Will there ever be (at
last!!) a financial report? As regards legality, your secretary
is wrong in his last letter: much can and should still be
done in the sense of increasing the paper’s legality.

How many subscribers are there now?
 

Notes

Za Pravdu (For Truth)—one of the names under which the
Bolshevik paper Pravda appeared from October 1 (14) to December 5
(18), 1913. Altogether 52 issues appeared; 24 were confiscated and for 2
the editors were fined.  

The financial report referred to in the letter was printed in No. 9 of
Za Pravdu, October 13.

To the Editor

For the Editorial Board

Dear Colleagues,

Welcoming the excellent beginning of the struggle by
the six deputies for proper respect of the will of the majority
of the workers, and the excellent campaign of your
paper,[1]
I would ask you also to take notice of the following:

If the Seven begin impudently proclaiming themselves
the Social-Democratic group (as they have done at, the end
of their article in
No. 60[2]). then the Six must without
fail declare calmly, briefly and firmly: “We are the
Social-Democratic Labour group, since we act in keeping with the
will of the majority of the class-conscious workers, put it
into effect and represent the majority. The seven non-Party
deputies have not refuted a single fact, a single figure,
out of the mass quoted in our paper and demonstrating this
truth. Here is our address; write to us, worker comrades,
and do not imagine that we shall insult you by thinking
you capable of believing the theory that ‘seven deputies are
higher than the Party, higher than the will of the majority
of the workers’. Even 77 deputies could not be higher than
that will. We are strictly fulfilling it.”

Such a brief declaration is essential. Then you should
send a formal statement to Senior Conventus (i.e., to the
State Duma). Then the Seven will very rapidly, at, once
lose their arrogance: very, very rapidly they will agree
    

to equality (which all of them have recognised in writing).
Neither they nor anyone else will have any other way out.
Once you have begun a job, you can’t back out. The
Six have made a splendid beginning, and their victory is
assured, if they carry on correctly—in a week or two their
victory is inevitable.

Best greetings and wishes,
 V. I.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In October 1913 Za Pravdu published a statement by the
Bolshevik deputies (the Six) demanding that the Menshevik section of the
Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma (the Seven) should recognise the
equality of the Six and the Seven to decide all questions in the
Social-Democratic group in the Duma. In the same month the Bolshevik
deputies announced in Za Pravdu the refusal of the Menshevik
liquidators to acknowledge the equality of the Six and the Seven in the
group and stated that it was necessary to form an independent Bolshevik
workers’ group in the Duma.





[2]
Lenin refers to the article “A Threat to the Unity of the
Social-Democratic Group”, which was published in the liquidators’
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 60, October 18, 1913.

Dear Colleagues,

I congratulate you on the excellent beginning of your
campaign for the rights of the worker deputies.

After reading the dirty intrigue in Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta, I earnestly advise you to think matters over and
accept my plan of
yesterday.[1]

Such things must not be left
without an organisational solution.

It is not enough for the workers to send resolutions: it
is essential that the workers should organise deputations
to the Duma group.

Greetings and best wishes!

Yours,
 V. I.

In view of the importance of the campaign against the
Seven, it is extremely important for us, as contributors,
to have daily information. But Za Pravdu is late every day.
We earnestly ask you to take steps to see that the paper is
sent daily in good time, and without delay.

That the majority is for the Six is clear. But the conduct
of the Six is inconsistent. Victory is within their grasp,
if they take the logically (and politically) inevitable step
and proclaim themselves a separate group.

Once this is done, and a statement handed in to the Duma,
the Seven will he obliged (by the very technique of work
in the Duma) to enter into an agreement with the Six.

It would be ridiculous to let victory slip from their hands
when it is completely assured. The more resolutely they
separate, the more speedily will federation be restored.

The campaign against the Seven began excellently, but is
now being carried on with insufficient determination. In
reply to the most shameless insolence of the liquidators,
the newspaper needs not to complain but to attack, stressing
the infringement of the will of the proletariat by the Seven,
and their anti-Party character. The watchword should be:
“Resign your seats, gentlemen of the Seven, if you don’t
want to reckon with the will of the majority of the workers,
if you want to go against the Party.” This watchword should
be made quite clear and precise, repealing it daily.

Dear Colleagues,

It is essential to insert a loose sheet on Sunday, devoted
entirely to the campaign for the Six.

One big article, with subheads.

We send you the
text.[1]

Put in the resolution of the 
Conference[2] (was it on account of that resolution that that issue
of Za Pravdu was confiscated?).

You should demand that the Seven resign their seats.

Add the results of the Petersburg resolutions, if they
are clearly in our
favour.[3]

Drop us a line, or telegraph: “Supplement in hand.”

Best greetings,
 Yours,
 V. I.

Dear Colleagues,

I hasten to congratulate with all my heart all Marxist
workers on the victory of the cause of the majority against
the disorganisers, on the setting up of a group which does
not wish to thwart the will of the
majority.[1] I have just
received the Sunday issue of Za Pravdu. The calculations
are particularly good—they should be continued.
Once again, greetings to all from all.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear A. M.,

Whatever are you doing? This is simply terrible, it
really is!

Yesterday I read your reply in Rech to the “howling”
over
Dostoyevsky,[1] and was preparing to rejoice, but
today the liquidators’ paper arrives, and in it there is a
paragraph of your article which was not in Rech.

This paragraph runs as follows:

“And ‘god-seeking’ should be for the time being” (only
for the time being?) “put aside—it is a useless occupation:
it’s no use seeking where there is nothing to be found.
Unless you sow, you cannot reap. You have no God, you
have not yet”
(yet!) “created him. Gods are not sought—they
are created; people do not invent life, they create it.”

So it turns out that you are against “god-seeking” only
“for the time being”!! It turns out that you are against
god-seeking only in order to replace it by god-building!!

Well, isn’t it horrible that such a thing should appear
in your article?

God-seeking differs from god-building or god-creating
or god-making, etc., no more than a yellow devil differs from
a blue devil. To talk about god-seeking, not in order to
declare against all devils and gods, against every ideological
necrophily (all worship of a divinity is necrophily—be it
the cleanest, most ideal, not sought-out but built-up divinity,
it’s all the same), but to prefer a blue devil to a yellow one
is a hundred times worse than not saying anything about
it at all.
 

In the freest countries, in countries where it is quite
out of place to appeal “to democracy, to the people, to
public opinion and science”, in such countries (America,
Switzerland and so forth) particular zeal is applied to render
the people and the workers obtuse with just this very idea
of a clean, spiritual, built-up god. Just because any religious
idea, any idea of any god at all, any flirtation even with a
god, is the most inexpressible foulness, particularly
tolerantly (and often even favourably) accepted by the democratic
bourgeoisie—for that very reason it is the most dangerous
foulness, the most shameful “infection”. A million physical
sins, dirty tricks, acts of violence and infections are much
more easily discovered by the crowd, and therefore are
much less dangerous, than the nubile, spiritual idea of god,
dressed up in the most attractive “ideological” costumes.
The Catholic priest corrupting young girls (about, whom I
have just read by chance in a German newspaper) is much
less dangerous, precisely to “democracy”, than a priest
without his robes, a priest without crude religion, an
ideologically equipped and democratic priest preaching the
creation and the invention of a god. For it is easy to expose,
condemn and expel the first priest, while the second cannot
be expelled so simply; to expose the latter is 1,000 times
more difficult, and not a single “frail and pitifully wavering”
philistine will agree to “condemn” him.

And you, knowing the “frailty and pitiful wavering” of
the (Russian: why Russian? Is the Italian any better??)
philistine soul, confuse that soul with the sweetest of poisons,
most effectively disguised in lollipops and all kinds of
gaily-coloured wrappings!!

Really, it is terrible.

“Enough of self-humiliation, which is our substitute for
self-criticism.”

And isn’t god-building the worst form of self–
humiliation?? Everyone who sets about building up a God, or who
even merely tolerates such activity, humiliates himself
in the worst possible way, because instead of “deeds” he
is actually engaged in self-contemplation, self-admiration
and, moreover, such a man “contemplates” the dirtiest,
most stupid, most slavish features or traits of his “ego”,
deified by god-building.
 

From the point of view, not of the individual, but of
society, all god-building is precisely the fond self–
contemplation of the thick-wilted philistine, the frail man in the
street, the dreamy “self-humiliation” of I he vulgar petty
bourgeois, “exhausted and in despair” (as yon condescended
to say very truly about the soul: only yon should have said,
not “the Russian”, but the petty-bourgeois, for the Jewish,
the Italian, the English varieties are all one and the same
devil; stinking philistinism everywhere is equally
disgusting—but “democratic philistinism”, occupied in ideological
necrophily, is particularly disgusting).

Reading your article over and over again, and trying to
discover where this slip of your tongue could come from,
I am at a loss. What does it mean? A relic of the “
Confession”, which you yourself did not approve?? Or its echo??

Or something different: for example, an unsuccessful
attempt to bend back to the viewpoint of democracy in general,
instead of the viewpoint of the proletariat? Perhaps it was
in order to talk with “democracy in general” that you decided
(excuse the expression) to indulge in baby-talk? Perhaps it
was “for a popular exposition” to the philistines that you
decided to accept for a moment their, the philistines’,
prejudices??

But then that is a wrong approach, in all senses and in
all respects!

I wrote above that in democratic countries it would be
quite out of place for a proletarian writer to appeal “to
democracy, to the people, to public opinion and science”.
Well, but what about us in Russia?? Such an appeal is not
quite appropriate, because it also in some ways flatters
the prejudices of the philistines. A kind of general appeal,
general to the point of vagueness—even Izgoyev of Russkaya

Mysl[2] will sign it with both hands. Why then select
watchwords which you distinguish perfectly well from those of
Izgoyev, but which the reader will not be able to
distinguish?? Why throw a democratic veil over the question
for the reader, instead of clearly distinguishing the petty
bourgeois (frail, pitifully wavering, exhausted, despairing,
self-contemplating, god-contemplating, god-building,
god-indulging, self-humiliating, uncomprehendingly-anarchistic—
wonderful word!!—et cetera, et cetera)
 

—from the proletarians (who know how to be of good
cheer not only in words, and who are able to distinguish the
“science and public opinion” of the bourgeoisie from their
own, bourgeois democracy from proletarian democracy)?

Why do you do this?

It’s damnably disappointing.

Yours,
 V. I.

P.S. We sent you the novel by registered book post. Did
you receive it?

P.P.S. Get as good medical treatment as you can, please,
so that you can travel in the winter, without colds (it’s
dangerous in the winter).

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter was prompted by the appearance in Russkoye
Slovo (Russian Word) No. 219, September 22, 1913, of an article by
Gorky “On the Karamazov Attitude”, protesting against the Moscow Art
Theatre’s staging of Dostoyevsky’s reactionary novel The
Possessed. The bourgeois press came to the defence of the play and
Gorky replied with another article “Once Again on the Karamazov
Attitude”, which was published in No. 248 of Russkoye Slovo,
October 27, 1913.  

Large sections of the article, but without the concluding para graph,
were reprinted on October 28 (November 40) in Rech No. 295.  The
next day Gorky’s article, including the final paragraph, which Lenin quotes
in full in his letter, was reprinted in the liquidators’ Novaya
Rabochaya Gazeta No. 69.

Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought)—literary-political magazine
that was published in Moscow from 1880 to 1918. After the 1905 revolution
it became the organ of the Right wing of the Constitutional-Democratic
(Cadet) Party. Izgoyev, A.S., a bourgeois journalist, was one of
the ideologists of this party.

Sharp, and nothing more. For God’s sake, less sharpness.
Analyse (he arguments more calmly, repeal the truth, as

...[1]
On the question of god, the god-like and everything
connected with it, there is a contradict ion in your
position—the same, I think, which I used to point out in our
talks when we last met in Capri. You broke (or appeared
to break) with the Vperyod people, without having noticed
the ideological basis of “Vperyodism”.

The same has happened now. You are “most vexed”, you
“cannot understand how the words ‘for the time being’ crept
in”—that is how you write—and yet at the same time you
defend the idea of God and god-building.

“God is the complex of those ideas, worked out by the
tribe, the nation, mankind, which awaken and organise
social feelings, having as their object to link the
individual, with society and to bridle zoological individualism.”

This theory is obviously connected with the theory or
theories of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky.

And it is clearly wrong and clearly reactionary. Like
the Christian socialists (the worst variety of “socialism”,
and its worst distortion), yon make use of a method which
(despite your best intentions) repeals the hocus-pocus of
the priests: you eliminate from the idea of God everything
about it that is historical and drawn from real life (tilth,
prejudices, sanctified ignorance and degradation, on the
one hand, serfdom and monarchy, on the other), and
instead of the reality of history and life (here is
substituted in the idea of God a gentle petty-bourgeois phrase
(God=“ideas which awaken and organise social feelings”).
 

Your wish in so doing is to say something “good and
kind”, to point out “truth and justice” and the like. But your
good wish remains your personal affair, a subjective “
innocent desire”. Once you have written it down, it goes out
among the masses, and its significance is determined not
by your good wishes, but by the relationship of social forces,
the objective relationship of classes. By virtue of that
relationship it turns out (irrespective of your will and
independently of your consciousness) that you have put a
good colour and a sugary coating on the idea of the
clericals, the Purishkeviches, Nicholas II and the
Struves,[2] since in practice the idea of God helps
them keep the people in slavery. By beautifying the idea of god,
you have beautified the chains with which they fetter ignorant workers and
peasants. There—the priests and Co. will say—what a good and profound
idea this is (the idea of God), as even “your” leaders
recognise, Messrs. democrats: and we (the priests and Co.) serve that idea.


it is untrue that god is the complex of ideas which awaken and organise
social feelings. That is Bogdanov idealism, which suppresses the
material origin of ideas. God is (in history and in real life) first of all
the complex of ideas generated by the brutish subjection of man both by
external nature and by the class yoke—ideas which consolidate
that subjection, lull to sleep the class struggle. There was a
time in history when, in spite of such an origin and such a real meaning of
the idea of God, the struggle of democracy and of the proletariat went on
in the form of a struggle of one religious idea against another.


But that time, too, is long past.  

Nowadays both in Europe and in Russia any, even the most
refined and best-intentioned defence or justification of the idea of God is
a justification of reaction.  

Your entire definition is reactionary and bourgeois, through and
through.  God==the complex of ideas which “awaken and organise social
feelings, having as their object to link the individual with society and to
bridle zoological individualism 

Why is this reactionary? Because it falsely colours the idea of
“bridling” zoology preached by priests and feudals. In reality,
“zoological individualism” was bridled not by

    

the idea of God, it was bridled both by the primitive herd and the
primitive community. The idea of God always put to sleep and
blunted the “social feelings”, replacing the living by the dead, being
always the idea of slavery (the worst, hopeless slavery). Never
has the idea of God “linked the individual with society”: it has always
tied the oppressed classes hand and foot with faith in
the divinity of the oppressors.  

Your definition is bourgeois (and not scientific, not historical)
because it operates with sweeping, general, “Robinson Crusoe” conceptions
in general, not with definite classes in a definite historical
epoch.  

The idea of God among the Zyrian savages, etc. (including semi-savages)
is one thing. With Struve and Co. it is something quite different. In both
cases class domination supports this idea (and this idea supports it). The
“popular” conception of God and the divine is “popular” ignorance,
degradation, darkness, just like the “popular conception” of the tsar,
the devil and dragging wives by the hair. I completely fail to understand
how you can call the “popular conception” of God “democratic”.  

It is untrue that philosophical idealism “always has in view only the
interests of the individual”. Did Descartes have the interests of the
individual more in mind than Gassendi? Or Fichte and Hegel as compared with
Feuerbach?  

That “god-building is the process of the further development and
accumulation of social elements in the individual and society” is simply
terrible!! If there were freedom in Russia, the entire bourgeoisie would
praise you to the skies for such things, for such sociology and theology of
a purely bourgeois type and character.  

Well, that’s enough for the time being: this letter is too long as it
is. Once again, I shake your hand and wish you good health.  

Yours, 

V. I.

I have just had the telegram, and changed the envelope,
which had been marked for A....  

What’s happening to the Central Organ?? This is a disgrace and a
scandal!!  No sign of it yet, and not even the proofs. Enquire and get an
explanation, please.  

The issue of Vorwärts where Kautsky used the rotten phrase
that there is no Party (die alte Partei sei verschwunden
literally) is No. 333 of December 18, 1913. You should get hold of it (rue
de Bretagne. 49 or somewhere else) and organise a protest campaign. We are
for an exchange of opinion, for the resolution of the
I.S.B.—this N.B.—but are absolutely against Kautsky’s
scoundrelly
phrase.[2] He should be beaten unmercifully for this, with the
reservation that we are for Aussprache (exchange of opinion), etc.

Idiotically stupid are the people who have “taken fright” at trusted
agents,[2] as something allegedly “insulting” to the Party
cells. That means, the argument runs, that there are no Party cells if
they want trusted agents!  

Comedians! They chase words, without thinking about how
devilishly complicated and subtle life is, producing entirely new
forms, which we only partly “catch on” to.  

People for the most part (99 per cent of the bourgeoisie, 98 per cent
of the liquidators, about 60–70 per cent of the Bolsheviks) don’t know how
to think, they only learn words by heart. They’ve learnt
the word “underground”. Firmly.  They can repeat it. They know it by
heart.  

But how to change its forms in a new situation, how
to learn and think anew for this purpose, this we do not under
stand.  

The summer conference of 1913 (abroad) decided to over come the
Seven. The campaign of the working masses in the autumn of 1913 in
Russia—the majority are for us!! A “circle” of “trusted
agents” (without election by the Party cells!!  Alarm!!—shout Antonov,
Isaac and Co.) decided—and the masses carried it out.  

How can that be done? Well, that is where one must learn to understand
such a “cunning” mechanism. It could not have been done, were
there no underground and no Party cells. And it could not have been
done, if there were no new and cunning forms of the
underground and the Party cells.  
 

I am very interested in whether you will succeed in making our people
understand this. Write in as much detail as you can.  

We have received one copy of Sputnik
Rabochego.[3] 5,000 copies have already been sold!!
Hurrah!! Set about the women’s
journal[4] super-energetically!

Trusted agents—workers chosen to maintain constant contact
between the Central Committee and the local Social-Democratic groups, and
to evolve flexible forms of leadership for local activities in the big
working-class centres. The system of trusted agents was initiated by the
Cracow Conference of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. of 1913 and the need for it
was confirmed by the Poronin Conference.

Sputnik Rabochego na 1914 God (Worker’s Handbook for
1914)—a pocket calendar put out by the Party Priboi Publishers in
December 1913. The whole edition was sold in one day. In February 1914 a
second, revised edition was produced.  

The calendar included Lenin’s article “Strikes in Russia” (see
present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 534–38).

1914


Cracow, January 12, 1914 

Dear Comrade Wijnkoop, 

Thank you most cordially for your kind letter. I hope you have read in
the German Social-Democratic papers (Vorwärts and Leipziger
Volkszeitung) the articles of our opponents (for example,
J. K. of the Rosa Luxemburg group, and Z. L., who
represents no group in Russia, in Leipziger
Volkszeitung). The German Social-Democratic press is boycotting us,
particularly Vorwärts, and only Leipziger Volkszeitung
has printed one article from us (signed by the editorial board of
Sotsial-Demokrat, Central Organ of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour
Party[1]

).



In Bremer
Bürger-Zeitung[2] Radek writes about Russian affairs. Yet Radek
also represents no group whatever in Russia! It is ridiculous to
print articles by emigrants who represent nothing, and not accept articles
from the representatives of organisations which exist in Russia!  

And the attitude of Kautsky—can anything be more idiotic? In relation
to all other countries he studies the history of the movement, criticises
documents, tries to understand the true sense of the differences,
the political significance of splits. In relation to Russia, history does
not exist for him. Today he repeats what he has heard from Rosa Luxemburg,
yesterday he repeated what he had heard from Trotsky, Ryazanov and other
writers who only represent

    

their own “pious wishes”, tomorrow he will begin to repeat what other
Russian students or emigrants are kind enough to tell him, and so on. While
in Neue Zeit (!!) only commonplaces, declamations, no facts, no
understanding of the essence of the questions on which we differ!! Pure
childishness!!  

We are being lectured on unity with the liquidators of our Party—an
absurdity. It is we who are bringing unity into being, by rallying the
workers of Russia against the liquidators of our Party. I attach a
document which we circulated to members of the International Socialist
Bureau. You will find there facts and figures which prove
that we are the ones who represent the unity of the Party (and the vast
majority of the workers) in Russia against, groups of liquidators
who are without workers.  

Unfortunately even Pannekoek in Bremer Bürger-Zeitung
refuses to understand that you have to print the articles of the two wings
of Social-Democracy in Russia, and not the articles of Radek who represents
only his own personal ignorance and fantasy, and who does not wish
to provide precise facts.  

Once again I thank you, dear Comrade Wijnkoop, you personally and the
Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party, for your kind letter,
and please pass on my greetings to Comrade Gorter.  

I hope you will forgive my bad French.  

Yours, 

Vl. Ulyanov (N. Lenin) 

Wl. Uljanow. 51. Ulica Lubomirskiego, Krakau (Cracovie).

Dear Friend, 

I send you the draft Ukrainian appeal for Shakhtyorsky
Listok,[1] and particularly ask you to be tactful in getting it
adopted (not on my behalf, of course, and better not in your name either)
through
Lola[2] and two or three Ukrainians (of course, against
Yurkevich and, if possible, without the knowledge of this
disgusting, rotten nationalist philistine, who under the flag of Marxism is
preaching the division of the workers by nationalities, a
special national organisation of the Ukrainian workers).  

You will understand why it is inconvenient for me to send such
a draft in my own name. Lola wrote to me that he agrees with me
against Yurkevich, but Lola is naïve. The matter, however, must
not drag on. It is terribly important that a voice should be heard from
amongst the Ukrainian Social-Democrats for unity against
dividing up the workers by nations. And now Shakhtyorsky Listok
(received by me only today, Wednesday, April 1, as a supplement to the
Sunday Put Pravdy) should immediately be made use of for
this purpose.  

Rewrite my draft (I agree to all changes, of course, if only
there remains the direct protest against the division by nations); let Lola
alone or with someone else, etc., accept and translate it into
Ukrainian, and then send it through me to Put Pravdy
in his name or (better) on behalf of a group (though it be of two or three
people) of Ukrainian Marxists (still better, Ukrainian workers).  
 

This should be done tactfully, quickly, against Yurkevich and
without his knowledge, because this twister will make trouble.


(I have received your story of Stepanyuk’s report and the speech by
Yurkevich; frankly speaking, I was angry with you—you didn’t understand
what the essence of Yurkevich’s position was. And I again—I’m
sorry—called you the Holy Virgin. Please don’t be angry, it was because
I’m fond of you, because we’re friends, but I can’t help being angry when I
see “something that recalls the Holy Virgin”.)  

Reply as quickly as possible and say whether you can carry out this
assignment properly, and how soon.  

On Monday I sent you the collection and a note attached to Nadya’s
letter. Have you received them?  

All the best.  

Yours, 

V.U. 

If my draft could be retold by a Ukrainian voice, and with a couple of
vivid Ukrainian examples, that would be best of all!! I will bring pressure
to bear on Put Pravdy.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Shakhtyorsky Listok (Miners’ Leaflet)—appeared on March 16,
1914 as a supplement to No. 38 of Put Pravdy. It was published on
the initiative of the miners themselves and on funds which they
collected. The second Shakhtyorsky Listok came out in No. 77 of
Put Pravdy, May 4, 1914.  

The Appeal to the Ukrainian Workers was printed in Ukrainian
in No. 28 of Trudovaya Pravda on June 29, 1914 over the signature
of Ocksen Lola. The MS. of Lenin’s draft appeal has not been preserved. The
contents of the document published in Trudovaya Pravda justify the
assumption that it was Lenin’s work.  

The “Editorial Comment on Ocksen Lola’s ‘Appeal to the Ukrainian
Workers’” was written by Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 20,
p. 494).





[2]
Lola, 0. N. (Stepanyuk) (1884–1919)—Ukrainian
worker and Bolshevik. Persecuted for his revolutionary activities, he
emigrated after the 1905–07 revolution to Galicia, then to Paris.

Dear Friend, 

I enclose Lola’s
letter.[2] Return it at once after reading it. (He is
obviously twisting, but all the same we shall make a small step
forward through him. I beg you very much, if you go to Zurich, do your
utmost to see the Ukrainian Social-Democrats, ascertain their attitude on
the question of a separate national-Ukrainian Social-Democratic
organisation, and try and organise even a little group of
anti-separatists.)  

If Nik. Vas. has not yet been at our printing-press, let him ask them:


1) to stick both leaflets on paper with the printed heading of
the press; 

2) to write out in German (or, if they don’t know the
language, then in French) an exact estimate of the cost of (α)
setting, (β) the same paper 5,000+1,000, (γ) printing
and everything else.  

As regards an intensive effort to discover contacts (in order to
prepare for “the important
affair”[3])—and especially for correspondence—both in Paris and in
Switzerland, I hope you will do your best.  

Yours, 

V.U. 

P.S. Would it not be possible before your departure to concentrate all
our books (and those which Kamsky has from Orlovsky’s library) with
Nik. Vas., and make him swear an oath not to allow them to be
plundered. If
       brother[1]
    

has written about his books, do the same with them. From this library
(Orlovsky’s, Kamsky has it) please get, or have procured, the Minutes
of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., and send them to me as
quickly as possible.  

One more thing s. v. pl.: 

It is essential to republish the Party Programme and Rules (with the
changes of January
1912).[4] Please let the Committee of Organisations Abroad have them
set up (after ascertaining the exact cost) and send us the
page proof:
we shall say then how many should be printed.  

[“Programme and Rules of the R.S.D.L.P.”]  

Is there in Paris No. 11 of Sotsial-Demokrat
(February or March 1910)? If there is, send us all the copies.



 
Notes

This word was written by Lenin in English.—Ed.  
 



[2]
Lenin sent Inessa Armand 0. Lola’s (Stepanyuk’s) letter of April 22
(N.S.), 1914, in which Lola wrote that he was entirely in agreement with
the “Appeal to the Ukrainian Workers”, but that it should be printed on
behalf of the Pravda editorial board and not over his signature.





[3]
The “important affair” was the preparation for the next Party
Congress which was to be held in accordance with the decision of the
“August” (sometimes called “Summer”) 1913 Conference of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. and Party workers. The outbreak of the First World War prevented
this.





[4]
The Programme and Rules of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party, with amendments to the Rules made by the Sixth (Prague)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. of 1912, were published by the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. in Paris in 1914.

P.S. I have not spoken with Yurkevich, but I must say that I am
profoundly indignant at the preaching of separation of the
Ukrainian workers into a special Social-Democratic organisation.  

With Social-Democratic greetings,

Lenin 

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter is an addendum to a letter from G. Y. Zinoviev to the
editorial board of the magazine Dzvin, in which Zinoviev re ported
on his talks with a member of the editorial board, L. Yurkevich, on the
conditions under which the Bolsheviks might work for the magazine.  

The statements in favour of splitting off the Ukrainian workers into a
separate Social-Democratic organisation which roused Lenin’s indignation
had been made in Yurkevich’s preface to a book by Levinsky, Ocherk
razvitiya ukrainskogo rabochego dvizheniya v Galitsii (Outline of the
Development of the Ukrainian Working-Class Movement in Galicia) (Kiev,
1914). Lenin sharply criticised the views of the bourgeois nationalist
Yurkevich on the problem of nationalities in his article “The Right of
Nations to Self-Determination” (see present edition, Vol. 20,
pp. 448–49).  

Dzvin (The Bell)—legal nationalist monthly with a Menshevik
orientation; published in Ukrainian in Kiev from January 1913 to the middle
of 1914.

May 18, 1914 

Dear Comrade Nazar, 

Many thanks to you for the bulletins of the 13th Census and for the
fifth volume of the 12th (1900) Census.  

I have been expecting any day the same volume (Agriculture) of
the 13th Census (Census of 1910), but for some reason it does not
arrive. Probably the Statistical Bureau has sent it to you, because
Hourwich wrote to me that this volume had been published. Please drop me a
line whether you have this volume (Agriculture. Census of 1910), whether you can get it and send it me. I will
immediately send you the cost of postage.  

Please note my new address: Poronin (Galizien).  

Congratulations on the splendid May Day in Russia:
250,000 in Petersburg alone!! Put Pravdy for May 1 has been
confiscated, but I have learned from Novy
Mir[2] that you often get confiscated issues as well. Altogether
the news from Russia is evidence that revolutionary feelings are developing
not only among the working class.  

On May 15 Sima is leaving Cracow (Zak&fwhatthe&awhatthed
K&awhatthepielowy D-ra Kadena w Rabce. Galizien) for the summer
to take a post in a village between Cracow and Poronin; she is very glad to
have got this post.  

N. K. sends her greetings. With all my heart I hope you will get better
and have a good rest in the summer.  

Yours,
V. I. 
 

P.S. We have lately had news from the organisation in the Urals: things
are not at all bad there. They’re alive and growing!  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Nakoryakov, N. N. (b. 1881)—began his revolutionary activity
in 1901, worked in the R.S.D.L.P. committees in Kazan and Samara and was a
delegate to the Fourth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. In 1911 he emigrated to
America, where he edited the Menshevik orientated
newspaper Novy Mir, published by Russian émigrés.
In 1917 he returned to Russia and in 1925 joined the R.C.P. (B).

Novy Mir (New World)—Menshevik-Orientated newspaper published by a group of Russian
émigrés in New York in 1911–17. From 1912 to 1916 the paper

458).

May 19, 1914[2] 

Dear Suren, 

I have received your letter of April 17. I hope you will reply when you
have read the end of the article on self-determination of nations (I am
writing it just now) in
      Prosveshcheniye.[1]


Regarding your pamphlet against An, be sure to send a
Selbstanzeige, or exposition, to
Prosveshcheniye,[3].  

I propose the following plan to you in addition. In order to combat the
stupidity of the “cultural-national autonomists”, it is necessary for the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour group to bring in a Bill in the Duma for
the equality of nations and the defence of the rights of national
minorities.  

Let’s draft such a
Bill.[4] The general principles of equality—the division of the
country into autonomous and self-governing territorial units according to,
among other things, nationality (the local population indicates the
boundaries, the State Parliament endorses them)—the limits of powers of
autonomous regions and areas, as well as of self-governing local
units—illegality of any departure from the equality of nations in the
decisions of the autonomous regions, Zemstvos, etc.; common school
councils, democratically elected, etc., freedom and equality of
language—choice of languages by municipal institutions, etc.— defence
of minorities: the right to a proportional share of

    

expenditure, to school premises (free) for pupils of “alien”
nationalities, to have “alien” teachers, “alien” departments in museums
and libraries, theatres, etc.—the right of every citizen to seek
cancellation (by the courts) of every departure from equality in respect of
any “infringement” of the rights of national minorities (five-year
censuses of the population in mixed regions, ten-year censuses in the state
as a whole), etc.  

I have a feeling that by this means we could give a popular explanation
of the stupidity of cultural-national autonomy and kill the
supporters of this stupidity for good.  

The Bill might be drafted by the Marxists of all, or of very
many, nations of Russia.  

Write immediately whether you agree to help in this. In general, write
more frequently, not less than once a week. It is unforgivable to
put off replying for a long time: have this in mind, especially now!!  

All the best, 

Yours, 

V.I.

The date “May 19” was crossed out by N. K. Krupskaya and replaced by
the date when the letter was sent, “June 4”. In the margin

   

is written: “For ... [one word heavily deleted.—Ed.]
urgent.” The letter has an addendum by N. K. Krupskaya: “Because
of the Bill the letter remained unposted for two weeks. Have you received
the previous letter sent to the same address? Why don’t you reply?  Warmest
greetings!”

Reference is to Shahumyan’s pamphlet National-Cultural
Autonomy, which he wrote in Armenian in 1913. The pamphlet was a reply
to articles by the Armenian bourgeois nationalist D. Ananun (An), “The
Problem of Nationalities and Democracy”.  

No communication from the author about the contents of the pamphlet was
published in Prosveshcheniye.





[4]
The outlines of the Bill given in this letter formed the basis of
Lenin’s “Bill on the Equality of Nations and the Safeguarding of the
Rights of National Minorities” (see present edition, Vol. 20
pp. 281–83). The Bill was to be brought into the Fourth Duma by the
Bolshevik group, but this was not achieved.

I have just read, my dear
       friend,[1]

Vinnichenko’s new novel which you sent
me.[3] There’s balderdash and stupidity! To combine together as much as
possible of every kind of “horror”, to collect in one story “vice” and
“syphilis” and romantic crime, with extortion of money by means of
blackmail (with the sister of the blackmailed person turned into a
mistress), and the trial of the doctor! All this with hysterical outbursts,
eccentricities, claims of having one’s “own” theory of organising
prostitutes. This organisation represents nothing bad in itself; but it is
the author, Vinnichenko himself, who makes nonsense of it,
smacks his lips over it, makes it his “hobby horse”.  

The review in Rech says that it is an imitation of Dostoyevsky
and that there are good parts in it. There is an imitation, in my opinion,
and a supremely bad imitation of the supremely bad in Dostoyevsky. Of
course, in real life there are individual cases of all the “horrors”
which Vinnichenko describes. But to lump them all together, and in
such a way, means laying on the horrors with a trowel,
frightening both one’s own imagination and the reader’s, “stunning” both
oneself and the reader.  

Once I had to spend a night with a sick comrade (delirium tremens), and
once I had to “talk round” a comrade who had attempted suicide (after the
attempt), and who some years later did commit suicide. Both recollections
à la Vinnichenko. But in both cases these were small
fragments


    

of the lives of both comrades. But this pretentious, crass idiot
Vinnichenko, in self-admiration, has from such things compiled a collection
that is nothing but horrors—a kind of “twopenny
dreadful”. Brrr.... Muck, nonsense, pity I spent so much time reading it.


P.S. How are things going with your arrangements for the summer?  

Yours, V. I. 

Franchement, continuez vous à vous f&ahatcher ou
      non?[2]

My

dear friend!  

The precedent letter I’ve sent in too much hurry. Now I can more
quietly speak about our
    “business”.[2]


I hope you’ve grasped what is in the report?[7] The most important
part is the conditions 1–13 (and then 14—slanderous, less
important). They should be presented as vividly as possible.  

N.B.: The addendum about the demonstration on April 4, 1914 goes
into the report, under the question of closing the
liquidationist paper. The addendum about the Plekhanov
Yedinstvo[8] goes into the report under the question of the
groups abroad 

I am sure that you are one of those people who develop, grow stronger,
become more vigorous and bold when they are alone in a responsible
position—and therefore I obstinately do not believe the
pessimists, i.e., those who say that you ... can hardly.... Stuff and
nonsense! I don’t believe it!  You will manage splendidly! With your
excellent French you’ll lay them all flat, and you won’t allow Vandervelde
to interrupt and shout. (In the event of anything like that, a formal
protest to the whole Executive Committee and a threat to leave the
meeting+the written protest of the whole delegation.)  

They must give you the right to make a report. You will say that you
ask for the opportunity, and that you have precise and practical
proposals. What could be more business-like

    

and practical? We put ours forward, you put yours, and then we shall
see. Either we adopt common decisions, or let us each report to our
congresses, to the Congress of our Party. (But in practice,
clearly, we shall adopt absolutely nothing.)  

The essentail thing, in my opinion, is to
prove that only we are the Party (the other side are a fictitious bloc or
tiny groups), only we are a workers’ party (on the other side are the
bourgeoisie, who provide money and approval), only we are the
majority, four-fifths.  

This is the first thing. And the second is to explain in as popular
language as possible (I should absolutely fail in this, not knowing
the language, while you will succeed) that the Organising Committee==a
fiction. The reality which it conceals is merely a group of
liquidationist writers in St. Petersburg. Proof? The literature....  

Collapse of the August bloc.

 (N.B. Departure of the Letts.)

 (Cf. Prosveshcheniye No. 5, I am sending my
       article[3]

to Popov.)  

The argument may be: your (i.e., Bolshevik) advantage among the Letts
is small, your majority is a small one. Reply: “Yes, it is small. If you
like to wait, it will soon be écrasante.” 

We excluded the liquidators’ group from the Party in January 1912. The
result?  Have they set up a better party?? None at
all. What they have is the complete break-up of the August bloc—aid
to them by the bourgeoisie, desertion of them by the workers. Either accept
our conditions, or no rapprochement, not to speak of
unité!!  

Arguments against Jagiello: an alien party. We don’t trust
it. Let the Poles unite.  

Argument against Rosa Luxemburg: what is real is not her
party, but the “opposition”. Proof: there were three electors
from Warsaw for the worker curia: Zalewski, Bronowski and
Jagiello. The first two belong to the opposition. (If Rosa evades
this, make her talk. If she denies it, demand that it be entered in the
minutes, promising that we shall expose Rosa L.’s
untruth.) And so all the Social-Democratic electors from
Warsaw=opposition (the elections to the

    

Fourth Duma). And in the rest of Poland? Unknown!! Give us the
names of the electors!!  


[[LEFT-BOX-END: 

Kautsky’s letter against Rosa and for the opposition was in
Pravda.[9] 

I am sending this No. to Popov. It can be quoted.

]]



In general, I think I have sent you rather too many of the
“most detailed” kind (as you asked), than too few.  

In any case, the three of you will always find arguments and reasons
and facts, and you always have the right to have a separate
consultation—as to appointing a speaker from the delegation, etc.  

The O.C. and the Bund will lie impudently: 

... “They too, they will say, have an underground. It was recognised
by the August Conference....”  

Untrue! Literature published abroad. Newspapers?

      The departure of the Letts? Their verdict?  

Quotations from “Nasha Zarya” and
“Luch” against the underground!! (These were “slips of
the tongue”?? Untrue! This is being said below by a bunch, a
handful of liquidationist workers, and it is a crying act of
disorganisation.)  

Or: you haven’t an underground either.  


{{ 
But is Pravda with 40,000 copies ranting about the underground? Or
are the workers letting themselves be deceived??  


[[DITTO: {{ ]] 

And what about the conference of the summer of 1913 and its
decision: that the 6 deputies should make a statement? And then
6,722 votes for us, 2,985 against.  A majority of 70 per cent!!  

Lay as much stress as possible on the trade unions and the
insurance committees: this has exceptional influence with the Europeans. We
shall not allow the liquidators to disorganise our firm majority in the
trade unions and insurance committees!!  

[4]

* I’ve forgotten the money question. We will pay for letters,
telegrams (please wire oftener) & railway expenses, hotel
expenses & so on. Mind it!  
 

If possible try to be on Wednesday evening already in Brussels in order
to arrange, prepare the delegation, come to agreement & so on.


If you succeed to receive the first report, for 1–2 hours,—it is
almost
all.*[5]

Afterwards it will only be a matter of “hitting back”, worming out
“their” counter-propositions (on all 14 questions) and declaring that we
are not in agreement, and will report to the Congress of our
Party. (We shall not accept a single one of their propositions.)  

Very truly.
       Yours,[6]


V. I. 

If there is talk of the money held by the former trustee, refer to the
resolution of January 1912,[10] and refuse to say any more. We, that is,
don’t renounce our right!!  

I am sending Popov Plekhanov’s articles (from Pravda) about
the
liquidators.[11] Quote them, and say that Pravda
remains of the same opinion.

Bolsheviks’ representatives had every formal right to use the Party

Dear Comrade Herman, 

It seems to me that an important moment is approaching in the
attitude of the Lettish Social-Democrats to the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party (in the person of the Central Committee—to our part
of the R.S.D.L.P.—if that suits your legitimists, who want to
“consider” the liquidators a little).  

Here clarity and honesty are necessary.  

In 1911–14 the Letts (their C.C.) were liquidators.  

At the Congress of 1914[2] they became opponents of liquidationism,
but neutral as between the O.C. and the C.C.  

Now, after Brussels, after the resolution in No. 32 of Trudovaya
Pravda,[3] the Letts want to enter our Party and conclude an
agreement with the C.C.  

Is this a good thing?  

It is good, if what is being done is clearly understood and there is an
honest attitude towards it.  

It is bad, if it is being done without clear understanding, without
firm resolution and reckoning with the consequences.  

Those who want legitimacy in the sense of restoring the
Stockholm-London (1906–07) R.S.D.L.P., had better not join our Party:
there will be no result except squabbles, disappointments, offence taken
and mutual hindrance. That was “a federation of the worst type” (as was
stated in the resolution of the January 1912 Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P.).[4] It was rottenness. Away with that rottenness!


If it is a question of defending the relics of federalism (for example,
the Stockholm agreement and delegation
    

from the Lettish C.C. to the Russian C.C.[5]), then it’s a waste of
time! In my belief we shall not accept it. It is play-acting, diplomacy
à la Tyszka (which is now being imitated by the scoundrels
in the Polish opposition, who went over at Brussels to the liquidators),
not team work. Are we agreed in principle? Yes or no? If the
answer is yes, then we must march together against
(1) liquidationism,
(2) “nationalism” (=(a) “cultural-national autonomy” and (b) the
separatism of the Bund),
(3) against federalism. We have clearly, openly, before all the workers of
Russia, unfurled these banners since January 1912. That is not a
short time. You could and should have realised what was involved.  

So let’s come to an agreement—if we are to agree—clearly and
honestly. To play at hide-and-seek, in my opinion, is out of place and
unworthy. We are waging a serious war: against us are all the
bourgeois intellectuals, the liquidators, the nationalists and the
separatists of the Bund, the federalists overt and covert. Either we
conclude an agreement against all these enemies, or it would
be better put off.  

It is better to confine ourselves to engagement than to tie ourselves
up with marriage, if there is no complete certainty that the union will
endure!!  

All this is my personal opinion.  

But I should very much like to come to an understanding with you and to
reach clarity. If we came to an agreement on fundamentals at Brussels, we
can and must ask ourselves without diplomacy whether we can agree
on a stable treaty.  

I am very worried that part of the Letts are 

for cultural-national autonomy, or wavering, 

for Bundist federalism, or wavering, hesitating to
attack the nationalism and separatism of the Bund,


hesitating to support our demand that the liquidationist paper
of a group of disorganisers in Petersburg[6] should be closed, etc.


Is it a great part? in general and among members of the Central
Committee? among the workers and among the intellectuals?  

Is it influential?  
 

After all, it, is we who are waging the battle against the
liquidators in Petersburg and throughout Russia. What
is to he done if yon cannot conscientiously help us tight
the liquidators and the Bundists?? To conclude a lasting
agreement in that case would he dishonest, and simply
unrealistic!

And now, in addition, there is this disgusting manoeuvre
of the Polish opposition in favour of the liquidators (voting
for the Brussels
resolution),[7] for nationalism (recognition
of cultural-national autonomy as “an arguable proposition”),
for federalism (the demand for the old, Tyszka, agreement
of 1906 with the
P.S.D.[1]

).



Clarity, clarity before everything else! Anyone who has
not realised the state and the circumstances of the war of
proletarian democracy against bourgeois democracy (= the
liquidators and the nationalists) had better wait.

I would like to know your opinion!

Yours,
 Lenin

I should he very glad to hear the opinion of “Paragraph”
on these questions. Show him this letter!

(Please give the “14 points” of our
C.C.[8] to Rude for
a day to read through.)

S.D.L.P.). Stressing the “need for unity of forces and activity of the
working class”, the resolution stipulated the following as the basis of
unity: (1) “uncurtailed demands”; (2) recognition of the underground; (3)
unity from below; (4) “recognition of the democratic majority and not the

July 21, 1914

Dear Colleague,

To my greatest regret, a number of quite exceptional and
unforeseen circumstances (beginning with the resignation
of Malinovsky) obliged me at the very beginning to
interrupt the article on
Marx[1] which I had begun, and after
several unsuccessful attempts to find time to continue it,
I have been forced to the conclusion that I shall not be able
to do this work before the autumn.

I offer you my profound apologies, and express the hope
that the editorial board of your so valuable publication will
have time to find another Marxist and get the article from
him by the time appointed.

Yours to command,
 V. Ilyin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin managed to finish his article on Marx in November 1914 (see
present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 43–91).  

In its reply to Lenin’s letter the Granat Bros. Publishing House wrote
on July 12 (O.S.), 1914: “Since with this particular article we connect a
whole series of factors of great importance to the entire character of the
Dictionary, we are unable to resign ourselves to having an indifferent,
average interpretation of this subject. We have all along wanted to get a
scientifically serious and forceful interpretation.... Though we have
considered foreign as well as Russian names, we cannot find an author. We
request you most earnestly, therefore, to go ahead with the article.... We
are prepared ... to grant a considerable postponement—till August
15.... We request you most insistently, again and again, not to

   

give it up and to share with us the view that this article would be a
valuable and necessary undertaking.” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.)

Dear Colleague 

Some days ago, despairing of any opportunity to finish
the work, I sent you a letter giving it up, with my
apologies.[1]

But now the political circumstances on which I am so
extremely dependent are suddenly changing again in
radical fashion. First of all, the exceptional security measures
in St. Petersburg, about which I read today in the Russian
papers, are to remain in force until September 4, 1914,
evidently meaning that the paper for which I was writing is
slopped until then. Secondly, the war will, it seems,
interrupt a number of urgent political affairs with which I was
burdened. Therefore I could now set about continuing the
article on Marx which I have begun, and could probably
finish it soon. If you have not yet placed the order with
someone else, and commissioned another author, please
reply by cable to me (at my expense): Uljanow. Poronin.
Rabotaite.[2]


If you have already commissioned someone else, please
reply by postcard.

With assurances of my deep respect,
 V. Ilyin

Absender: Wl. Uljanow, Poronin (Galizien), Austria.

Dear K.,

I have had your postcard, and hasten to reply. Wait
a little: we shall let you know about what can and should
be done regarding what you (and we)
desire.[1] Don’t forget,
by the way, that legality here is now of a special kind:
have you spoken about this with the friends at Lausanne?
Be sure to have a talk with them.

We remain at Berne. The address is Donnerbühlweg 11a.
Uljanow.

As regards a lecture, I don’t know yet. I shall have to
think it over, and consult in greater detail. How many
people could be counted on where you
are?[2]

All the best. Greetings from all.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. It might, perhaps, be better to give a talk about
the critique and my anti-critique. Two words nevertheless:
one cannot on formal grounds defend the scoundrelly
chauvinism of the Germans. There were bad resolutions, there
were some that were not bad; there were declarations of
both types. But there is a limit to everything! And it has
been overstepped. We cannot be patient, we cannot be
diplomatic we must revolt against shameful chauvinism with
all our strength!!

Dear Karpinsky,

I am taking advantage of this messenger to speak openly.

There is every ground for expecting that the Swiss police
and military authorities (at the first signal from the
Russian or French Ambassador, etc.) will bring us before a
military tribunal or expel us for breach of neutrality, etc.
Therefore don’t write anything openly in your letters. If
you have to communicate anything, write in chemicals (the
sign of chemicals is the date on the letter underlined).

We have decided to publish the attached manifesto,
instead of the not very readable
theses.[1] Let us know when
you get it, calling the manifesto “The Development of
Capitalism”.

It ought to be published. But we advise you to do this
only on condition that you take (are able to take) the
maximum precautions!!

No one should know where and by whom it was publisher!.
All rough copies should be burned!! The copies printed
should be kept only by some influential Swiss citizen,
deputy and so forth.

If this is impossible, don’t print it.

If it cannot be printed, do it on a mimeograph (also
with the greatest precautions). Reply: I have received the
development of capitalism (in so many) copies==I shall
reprint it in so many copies.

If it cannot be published, either in print or mimeographed,
write immediately. We shall think of something else.
Reply in as much detail as possible.
 

(If you succeed in publishing it, send us here by hand
3/4 of the copies; we shall find somewhere to keep them.)

I await a reply!

Yours,
 Lenin

N.B. [[ 

P.S. We shall find the money for the publication.
Only write beforehand, how much will be needed,
because there is very little money. Could not the 170 
francs from the Committee of Organisations
Abroad[2]
be used for this purpose?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the theses “The Tasks of Revolutionary
Social-Democracy in the European War”, known as “The Theses on War”, and
to the Manifesto of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., “The War and Russian
Social-Democracy” (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 15–19, 25–34).





[2]
The Committee of Organisations Abroad was elected at a
conference of the groups of the R.S.D.L.P. abroad in Paris in December
1911. Its composition changed several times. At the conference of
R.S.D.L.P. groups abroad held in Berne from February 27 to March 4, 1915,
N. K. Krupskaya, I. F. Armand, G. L. Shklovsky and V. M. Kasparov were
elected to the Committee. During the war the Committee was based in
Switzerland and worked under Lenin’s immediate guidance. It did much to
co-ordinate the activities of the R.S.D.L.P. sections abroad, campaigned
against the social-chauvinists, and worked for unity of the Left-wing
internationalists among the Social-Democrats of various countries.

Dear Friend

I spoke here today at Plekhanov’s lecture, against his
chauvinism.[1] I intend to deliver a lecture here on
Tuesday. I should like to lecture at Geneva (the European war
and European socialism) on
Wednesday.[2] Arrange it, after
proper discussion—as conspiratively as possible, i.e., so
that no permission will be required (of course, it is also
desirable that there should be a maximum audience). You
are the best judge of how to do this. It should combine
the maximum audience with the minimum of police
publicity and police interference (or police threats). At Berne I
lectured to members of the groups and guests whom they
recommended (about 120–130 persons), without notices, etc.
Would not this method be best?

Reply immediately to Mr. Ryvline. Villa Rougemont.
Chailly sur Lausanne. For me. On Tuesday I am lecturing
here at Lausanne, and your reply should be here by
Tuesday afternoon. When we meet, we can have a more detailed
talk about our affairs. And so, if permission is required at
Geneva, then think it over ten times, whether a closed
meeting would not be best. In general, of course, you decide.
If it is all right for Wednesday (to arrange the lecture for
Wednesday evening), I will arrive on Wednesday morning.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Plekhanov’s lecture “On the Socialists’ Attitude to the War” was
organised by the local group of Mensheviks in Lausanne on October 11, 1914.


Only Lenin spoke in the discussion of the lecture. Some brief notes by
Lenin on Plekhanov’s lecture and reply to the discussion, and also the
rough plan of Lenin’s speech on the lecture, have been preserved. A
newspaper report of Lenin’s speech was printed in Golos (Voice)
No. 33, October 21, 1914. A report on the meeting, containing the text of
Plekhanov’s lecture, was published in the same paper.





[2]
Lenin lectured on “The Proletariat and the War” in Lausanne on
October 14, 1914, and on “The European War and Socialism” in Geneva on
October 15.

Dear K.,

Just while I was staying in Geneva joyful news arrived
from Russia. There also arrived the text of the reply of
the Russian Social-Democrats to
Vandervelde.[1] We
therefore decided to publish, instead of a separate manifesto,
the next issue of the Central Organ,
Sotsial-Demokrat.[2]
Today this decision will be finally shaped, so to speak.

And so, please take all the necessary steps as soon^as
possible to find a Frenchman, i.e., a Swiss citizen, as a
responsible editor, and to determine the costs. We think
of two pages as the size, with a format something like that
of the Paris
Golos.[3] The dates of publication will be
indefinite—hardly more often than two or three times a
month at first. The printing will be small, because with our
orientation we cannot reckon on the man in the street (500
copies?). The price is to be about 10 centimes. All this is
still assumption, but you need to know it for the discussion
with the compositor.

And so, the price?

How long is needed for the publication (setting, etc.)
of an issue of that size?

Then the type? Is there only one large size, or is there
also a small size, brevier? How many thousand letters and
spaces will go into two pages of Golos format of
(1) large
type and
(2) small type, brevier?

You should not distribute the type of the manifesto
which has already been set: we shall fit it into the paper.
By Monday we shall send you some small amendments

    

to the manifesto, and a different signature (because after
contact with Russia we are now acting more officially).

A thousand greetings!

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Please check up whether my letters to you arrive
absolutely to time (without any delay).
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the Bolsheviks’ reply to Emile Vandervelde’s telegram,
which he sent to the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, appealing for
support of the Russian Government in the war against Germany. The reply,
which was published over the joint signature of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 33, November 1,

   

1914, stated that in the interests of democracy and socialism the
Bolsheviks considered it an urgent task of the revolutionary proletarian
party in the period of the imperialist war to extend and consolidate the
class organisations of the proletariat and to develop the class struggle
against the imperialist bourgeoisie and its governments.





[2]
The central organ of the R.S.D.L.P., Sotsial-Demokrat, was
revived by Lenin after it had been silent for almost a year. No. 33
appeared in Geneva on November 1 (14), 1914.

October 17, 1914

Dear Friend,

I arrived home last night after my lecture tour and found
your letters. Heartiest greetings to you, and, through you,
to all Russian friends. The reply to Vandervelde was given
to a translator yesterday, and I have not yet seen the text.
I will write about it as soon as I see it.

In my view the most important thing now is a consistent
and organised struggle against the chauvinism which has
seized upon the whole bourgeoisie and the majority of the
opportunist socialists (and those making their peace with
opportunism—like Mr. Kautsky!). And to perform the tasks
imposed by this struggle it is first of all necessary to
combat the chauvinism of one’s own country—specifically, in
Russia the gentry à la Maslov and Smirnov (see Russkiye
Vedomosti and Russkoye Slovo) whose “works” I have
read,[6]
or Messrs. Sokolov, Meshkovsky, Nikitin and others whom
you have seen or heard. Plekhanov, as I think you have
already been told, has become a French chauvinist. Among
the liquidators there is evidently
confusion.[1]

Alexinsky,
they say, is a Francophil. Kosovsky (the Bundist, a
Right-winger, I heard his lecture) is a
Germanophil.[2]

It seems
as though the middle course of the whole “Brussels
bloc”[7]
of the liquidator gentry with Alexinsky and Plekhanov will

    

be adapting themselves to Kautsky, who now is more
harmful than anyone else. How dangerous and scoundrelly his
sophistry is, covering up the dirty tricks of the opportunists
with the most smooth and facile phrases (in Neue
Zeit[8]).
The opportunists are an obvious evil. The German “Centre”
headed by Kautsky is a concealed evil, diplomatically
coloured over, contaminating the eyes, the mind and the
conscience of the workers, and more dangerous than
anything else. Our task now is the unconditional and open
struggle against international opportunism and those who screen
it (Kautsky). And this is what we shall do in the Central
Organ, which we shall shortly issue (probably two little
pages). We must with all our strength now support the
legitimate hatred of the class-conscious workers for the rotten
behaviour of the Germans, and draw from this hatred
a political conclusion against opportunism and any
concession to it. This is an international task. It devolves on us,
there is no one else. We must not retreat from it. It is wrong
to put forward the watchword of the “simple” restoration of
the International (for the danger of a rotten conciliatory
resolution on the Kautsky-Vandervelde line is very, very great!).
The watchword of “peace” is wrong: the watchword should
be transformation of the national war into a civil war.
(This transformation may be a long job, it may require and
will require a number of preliminary conditions, but all
the work should be carried on in the direction of precisely
such a transformation, in that spirit and on that line.)
Not sabotage of the war, not separate, individual actions
in that spirit, but mass propaganda (not only among
“civilians”) leading to the transformation of the war into
a civil war.

In Russia chauvinism hides behind phrases about “la
belle France” and unfortunate Belgium (and what about
the Ukraine, etc.?) or behind “popular” hatred of the
Germans (and of “Kaiserism”). Therefore our unquestionable
duty is to combat these sophistries. And in order that the
struggle should proceed along precise and clear lines we
need a watchword which generalises it. That watchword
is: for us Russians, from the point of view of the interests of
the working masses and the working class of Russia, there
cannot be the smallest doubt, absolutely any doubt, that

    

the lesser evil would be now, at once the defeat of tsarism
in this war. For tsarism is a hundred times worse than
Kaiserism. Not sabotage of the war, but the struggle against
chauvinism and the concentration of all propaganda and
agitation on the international rallying (rapprochement,
solidarity, agreement, selon les
circonstances[3]

)

of the
proletariat for the purpose of civil war. It would be a mistake
both to call for individual acts of shooting officers, etc.,
and to tolerate arguments like the one that “we don’t want
to help Kaiserism”. The first is a deviation towards
anarchism, the second towards opportunism. We, on the
contrary, must prepare mass (or at the very least collective)
action among the troops—not only of one nation—and
carry on all propaganda and agitation work in that
direction. The direction of our work (stubborn, systematic, maybe
protracted) in the spirit of turning the national war into
a civil war—there is the crux of the matter. The time for
this transformation is a different question, at present still
unclear. We must allow this moment to mature, and
systematically “make it mature”.

This is all for the time being. I will write frequently.
You write more often too.

Set forth in greater detail the leaflet of the Petersburg
Committee.

More details about the views and reactions of the workers.

The balance of forces among the “groups” in St. 
Petersburg? That is, have the liquidators grown stronger as regards
ourselves? To what extent?

Is Dan at liberty? His position? And that of Chirkin,
Bulkin and Co.?

More details.

To whom precisely, and in whose name, did you send
a hundred rubles?

All the very best.
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

The watchword of peace, in my opinion, is incorrect at
the present moment. It is a philistine, parson’s watchword.
The proletarian watchword must be civil war.

Objectively, from the radical change in the situation
in Europe, such a watchword follows for the epoch of a
mass war. The same watchword follows from the Basle
resolution.[9]

We can neither “promise” civil war nor “decree” it, but
to go on working—if necessary for a very long time—in
that direction, we are in duty bound. You will see the
details in the Central Organ
article.[4]

Meanwhile I am only
indicating the main points of our position, so that we can
reach a really good understanding.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Our intellectuals in Paris (outvoted in the section by the
workers) have gone as volunteers (Nik. Vas., Antonov and others) and
have issued a stupid non-Party
appeal[10] jointly with the S.R.s. It
has been sent to you.—Lenin

[2]
Martov is behaving most decently of all in Golos. But will
Martov hold out? I don’t believe it.—Lenin

[3]
According to circumstances.—Ed.

(present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 35–41).—Ed.
 



[5]
During the imperialist world war Shlyapnikov was sent to Stockholm by
the Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. and the Bolshevik group in the
Duma and was for a time the connecting link between Lenin and the Russian
section of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. and the Petersburg Committee.





[6]
Lenin refers to P. Maslov’s letter to the editors of Russkiye
Vedomosti, which was published under the heading “War and Commercial
Agreements” in No. 207 of the paper for September 10 (23), 1914, to the
article by Y. Smirnov (Gurevich), “The War and European Democracy”,
published in No. 202 of Russkiye Vedomosti, September 3 (16),
1914, and to the appeal by writers, artists and actors “Concerning the
War”, published in Russkoye Slovo No. 223, September 28
(October 11), 1914.





[10]
At the beginning of the war part of the Committee of R.S.D.L.P.
Organisations Abroad, which was in Paris, and some members of the Paris
section of the Bolsheviks—N. I. Sapozhkov (Kuznetsov), A. V. Britman
(Antonov) and others—together with the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries approved a declaration on be half of the
“Russian Socialists”, published it in the French press, and then went to
the front.





[7]
Lenin refers to the Brussels “Unity” Conference of July 16–18, 1914,
convened by the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau
“for an exchange of opinion” about the possibility of restoring the unity
of the R.S.D.L.P. Represented at the conference were the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks), the Organising Committee (Mensheviks), the
Plekhanov Yedinstvo group, the Vperyod group, the Bund,
the Social-Democratic Party of the Lettish Region, the Social-Democrats of
Lithuania, the Polish Social-Democrats, the Polish Social-Democratic
opposition and the P.P.S. (Letf wing). The
Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau was represented
by Emile  Vandervelde, Camille  Huysmans, Karl  Kautsky, A. Nemets and
others. Well in advance of the conference, the leaders of the
I.S.B. reached a secret agreement with the liquidators for joint action
against the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, refused to submit to

   

the decisions of the Brussels Conference and exposed before the
international proletariat the true aims of the “unifiers”.





[8]
Die Neue Zeit (New Times)—theoretical journal of the German
Social-Democratic Party. It was published in Stuttgart from 1883 to
1923. Up to October 1917 it was edited by Karl Kautsky, and afterwards by
Heinrich Cunow. During the First World War the journal took up a Centrist
position and virtually supported the social-chauvinists.





[9]
Reference is to the manifesto on the war passed by the Extraordinary
International Socialist Congress held in Basle, November 24–25, 1912. The
manifesto recommended that in the event of an imperialist war socialists
should use the economic and political crisis evoked by the war to fight for
a socialist revolution.

October 17, 1914

Dear Friend,

I have read the reply to Vandervelde, and attach my
ideas on the subject of that reply.

It would be extremely desirable that in the event of the
Duma being convened (is it true that it is being summoned
in a month’s
time?)[1] our group should make a statement
independent of the bloc, and should set forth a consistent
point of view. Reply at once
(1) whether there will be a
session of the Duma,
(2) whether you have good contacts
with the Duma
group,[2] and how many days this will
require.

October 21, 1914

I continue my interrupted letter. My criticism of the
reply, of course, is a private affair, intended only for friends
with the object of reaching complete mutual understanding.
The Central Organ will appear in a day or two, and we
shall send it to you.

About the International, don’t be an optimist, and beware
of the intrigues of the liquidators and opportunists.
Although Martov is going left today, this is because he is
alone. But what will happen tomorrow? Tomorrow he will
descend to their common plan: to slop the mouths (and the
mind and the conscience) of the workers with an indiarubber
resolution in the spirit, of Kautsky, who justifies all and
sundry. Kautsky is the most hypocritical, most revolting
and most harmful of all! It is internationalism, if you please,
for the workers of every country to shoot, at the workers of

    

another country under the guise of “defence of the
fatherland”!!!

Let them intrigue—it is after all no more than a petty
intrigue today, at such a moment in world history, to think
of playing diplomacy with opportunism and setting up a
“German” International Socialist
Bureau![3] We must today
maintain our principles. The workers of Petersburg are
imbued with the best feelings of enmity to the traitors
among the German Social-Democrats. With all our strength
we must support and consolidate that feeling and
consciousness into firm resolution to fight international opportunism.
Up till now German Social-Democracy was the main
authority—today it is a model of what not to do!

You are needed in Stockholm. Organise the
correspondence with Russia as well as you can. Send my letters (is
that
possibbe?) to the one who gave you a note in pencil:
we must reach an understanding with him in as much detail
as
possible.[4] This is extremely important. We are
beginning publication of the Central Organ.

Write more often!

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Russkaya Molva (Russian Tidings)—daily newspaper of the
Progressist Party; appeared in St. Petersburg from December 1912 to
August 1913.





[2]
Reference is to the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the
Fourth Duma, consisting of the Bolshevik deputies A. Y. Badayev,
G. I. Petrovsky, M. K. Muranov, F. N. Samoilov, N. R. Shagov and
R. V. Malinovsky (Malinovsky was subsequently exposed as an agent
provocateur). Working under the direct supervision and control of the
Central Committee, the Bolshevik group in the Duma acted on behalf of the
Party and the majority of class-conscious workers.





[3]
When he speaks of the creation of a “German” International Socialist
Bureau, Lenin has in mind the German social-chauvinists’ proposal to move
the headquarters of the I.S.B. Executive Committee from Brussels to
Amsterdam.





[4]
At the end of October 1914 Shlyapnikov talked with Pieter Troelstra,
leader of the Dutch Social-Democratic movement, who had come to Stockholm
on behalf of the opportunist leaders of German Social-Democracy to get an
agreement on the transfer of the Inter national Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.)
to Amsterdam for the duration of the war, and to influence the Scandinavian
Social-Democrats towards justifying the treacherous position taken up by
the leaders of German Social-Democracy. During his meeting with Troelstra,
which took place in the presence of a representative of the Organising
Committee, Y. Larin, the Menshevik Dalin, Alexandra Kollontai and others,
Shlyapnikov handed him the manifesto of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., and the
reply of the Bolshevik group in the Duma to Emile Vandervelde, and later,
at his request, sent him letters explaining the Bolsheviks’ attitude to the
war.

October 27, 1914

Dear Friend,

I have just received your second letter, and sit down
to have a talk with you.

Many thanks for the letter about events in St. 
Petersburg.[3] It will make an excellent report for the Central
Organ. An issue of the Central Organ will be published in a
few days, and we shall send it to you. Wait for it. Wait
also for the next issue. You must stay for the time being
in Stockholm until transport through Stockholm
(1) of
letters,
(2) of people and
(3) of literature has been completely
organised. For this you should systematically train and
test a good transmitting agent in Stockholm. Is Comrade
Skovno suitable for this? What’s good about her is that
she is a Bolshevik. She won’t go over to the other side.
But is she business-like, is she alert, does she attend to
details?

I am delighted if Comrade
Kollontai[4] has taken up
our position, and I am also glad at the excellent (on the
whole) management of Golos by Martov in Paris. But I
am in deadly fear that Martov (and others akin to him) will
go over ... to the position taken up by Kautsky and Troelstra.
I hate and despise Kautsky now more than anyone, with
his vile, dirty self-satisfied hypocrisy. Nothing has happened,
so he says, principles have not been abandoned,
everyone was entitled to defend his fatherland. It is
internationalism, if you please, for the workers of all countries
to shoot one another “in order to defend their fatherland”.
 

Rosa Luxemburg was right when she wrote, long ago,
that Kautsky has the “subservience of a theoretician”—
servility, in plainer language, servility to the majority of
the Party, to opportunism. Just now there is nothing in
the world more harmful and dangerous for the ideological
independence of the proletariat than this rotten self–
satisfaction and disgusting hypocrisy of Kautsky, who wants to
smother and cover up everything, to tranquillise the
awakened conscience of the workers by sophistries and
pseudo-scientific chatter. If Kautsky succeeds in this, he will
become the main representative of bourgeois corruption in
the working-class movement. And Troelstra will be for him
—oh, that Troelstra is a more skilful opportunist than the
“kind” little old man Kautsky! How that Troelstra
manoeuvred in order to drive honest men and Marxists out of the
Dutch Party (Gorter, Pannekoek, Wijnkoop)!! I shall
never forget how Roland-Hoist, when she once visited
me in Paris, said about Troelstra: “ein hundsgemeiner Kerl”
(gredin, in
French)[1]

....

I am sorry that you cast pearls
before
him....[5] Troelstra+the opportunist scoundrels in
the
Vorstand[2]

of the German Social-Democrats are carrying
on a dirty little intrigue in order to cover everything up.
Be on your guard, don’t become the unwilling victim of
that intrigue!! Don’t accidentally give any help to these
worst enemies of the working-class movement, who in an
epoch of crisis are defending chauvinism “theoretically”,
and carrying on a petty and revolting diplomacy. The
only one who has told the workers the truth—although not
loudly enough, and sometimes not quite skilfully—is
Pannekoek, whose article we have sent to you (pass on a
translation to the
Russians).[6] His words, that if now the “
leaders” of the International that was murdered by the
opportunists and Kautsky come together and begin “papering
over” the cracks, this “will be of no significance whatever”—
these are the only socialist words.
They are the truth. Bitter,
but the truth. And now the workers need the truth, the whole
truth, more than at any other time, not rotten diplomacy,
not playing at “papering over”, not smearing over the evil
with indiarubber resolutions.
 

It is clear to me that Kautsky, Troelstra plus
Vandervelde (it may be plus X+Y+Z or minus X, Y, Z—this is
not important) are now busy with an intrigue for that
purpose. The transfer of the International Bureau to
Holland is a similar intrigue by the same scoundrels.

I shall keep away from them and from it—and will give
the same advice to our representative in the International
Socialist Bureau (Litvinoff, 76. High Street. Hampstead,
London, N. W.)—and I advise you to do the same.

“Don’t attend the counsels of the
impious”,[7] don’t
put any faith in Troelstra, and the like, etc., etc., just
present them with a brief ultimatum: here is the manifesto
(a revision of the theses; we shall send it to you in print
in a few days) of our C.C. on the war: do you want to
publish it in your language?? No? Well, then adieu, our roads
diverge!

If Kollontai is on our side, let her help to “push” this
manifesto in the other languages. Make the acquaintance
of Höglund, a young Swedish Social-Democrat, leader of the
“opposition”, read him our manifesto (refer to me: we
became acquainted at Copenhagen). Sound out whether he
Is ideologically close to us (he is only a naïve, sentimental
anti-militarist: these are the very people who should be
told—either the watchword of civil war, or remain with the
opportunists and the chauvinists).

The essence of the whole problem in Russia now is to
organise an ideological rebuff to the opportunists of the
International and to Kautsky. This is the key question.
Won’t Martov go over at this point??... I fear so!...

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Die Neue Zeit (New Times)—theoretical journal of the German
Social-Democratic Party. It was published in Stuttgart from 1883 to
1923. Up to October 1917 it was edited by Karl Kautsky, and afterwards by
Heinrich Cunow. During the First World War the journal took up a Centrist
position and virtually supported the social-chauvinists.





[4]
Kollontai, Alexandra (1872–1952)—-member of the
Social-Democratic movement from the 1890s, took part in the revolution of
1905–07. Between 1906 and 1915 she was associated with the Mensheviks. In
1915 she became a member of the Bolshevik Party, having adopted a
revolutionary-internationalist stand at the out break of war. After the
October Socialist Revolution she held responsible posts.





[5]
At the end of October 1914 Shlyapnikov talked with Pieter Troelstra,
leader of the Dutch Social-Democratic movement, who had come to Stockholm
on behalf of the opportunist leaders of German Social-Democracy to get an
agreement on the transfer of the Inter national Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.)
to Amsterdam for the duration of the war, and to influence the Scandinavian
Social-Democrats towards justifying the treacherous position taken up by
the leaders of German Social-Democracy. During his meeting with Troelstra,
which took place in the presence of a representative of the Organising
Committee, Y. Larin, the Menshevik Dalin, Alexandra Kollontai and others,
Shlyapnikov handed him the manifesto of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., and the
reply of the Bolshevik group in the Duma to Emile Vandervelde, and later,
at his request, sent him letters explaining the Bolsheviks’ attitude to the
war.

Reference is to Anton Pannekoek’s article “Der Zusammenbruch der
Internationale” (“The Collapse of the International”), printed in
Berner Tagwacht, the organ of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party,
Nos. 245, 246 and 247, for October 20, 21 and 22, 1914.





[7]
Lenin refers to the conference of socialists of the neutral countries
proposed by Pieter Troelstra and Thorvald Stauning. The conference took
place in Copenhagen on January 17–15, 1915. It was attended by
representatives of the socialist parties of Sweden, Den mark, Norway and
Holland. The conference approved a resolution calling on the
Social-Democratic parties of the neutral countries to urge their
governments to mediate between the belligerent countries and thereby help
to restore peace. Some of the Social-Democratic parties placed before the
conference declarations on their attitude to the war. From the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. the conference received No. 33 of Sotsial-Demokrat
containing the manifesto “The War and Russian Social-Democracy”, and an
official report of the arrest of the Bolshevik deputies to the Duma.

Für Alexander


Dear Friend,

In two or three days you will receive our Central Organ,
and then I hope there will be complete “harmony” of our
views. Frankly speaking, I am a little afraid whether some
of the steps you have taken may not be interpreted in the
sense that you are ignoring our legitimate representative
in the International Socialist Bureau—Mr. Litvinoff, 76.
High Street. Hampstead. London, N. W. Of course, such
an interpretation will be a malicious distortion, but all
the same be more careful.

Troelstra has deceived you, or led you into error. He
is an arch-opportunist, and an agent of the intrigues of the
most scoundrelly centre of the most scoundrelly
opportunists—the German Social-Democrats (headed by Kautsky,
who basely defends the opportunists), with their most
foul Vorstand. We shall not attend any conferences or join
in any steps, taken on the initiative of scoundrels like them.
We will stand aside: let them disgrace themselves! For
they, having disgraced themselves once, will disgrace
themselves again. The French have already rejected their
intrigues, and without the French there can be only a dirty
comedy acted by dirty blackguards.

Larin, to all appearances, is swindling you without
scruple. If he expresses his “confidence” in the German
Vorstand, I can well understand that Troelstra has “taken
note of it”. Of course he would!! Confidence in the rottenest
opportunists!! For God’s sake correct what can be corrected,

    

and don’t express the least confidence, direct or indirect,
in any of the opportunists, either German or French.
Pannekoek is right: the Second International is dead for ever.
It was killed by the opportunists (and not by “
parliamentarism”, as the slow-witted Pannekoek put it). “Papering
over” the differences is only a petty intrigue, and we must
take no part in it, either direct or indirect.

We shall try to send you a couple of leaflets shortly.
Don’t go away, have patience. Arrange everything I wrote
to you about, wait until the Central Organ has reached
Russia, wait until we reach a complete understanding with
the Russian colleagues too (both with Kamenev and with
others), after they have received the Central Organ. Before
all this has been done there can be no thought of your
departure. It would be premature for us as yet to
leave.[2] Find
out, by the way, whether Social-Democratic things can
be printed in Sweden (as for example, our Central Organ).

Poor Gorky! What a pity that he has disgraced himself
by putting his signature under that rotten little paper
of the Russian liberal
gentry.[3] Both Meshkovsky and
Plekhanov and others (including Maslov and Smirnov)
have sunk to the same level.

Make sure of getting and rereading (or get someone to
translate to you) Kautsky’s Weg zur
Macht[1]

—what

he
wrote there about the revolution of our times!!

And what a scoundrel he has become now, renouncing all
this!

Our job now is a merciless war on chauvinism, covered
up by chatter about defence of the “fatherland” etc.,
especially on the “socialist chauvinism” of Plekhanov,
Guesde, Kautsky (the worst of the lot, the hypocrite!) and Co.
Defending the revolution (bourgeois in Russia and socialist
in the West), we preach it in wartime too. Our watchword
is civil war. It is all purest sophistry that this watchword
is unsuitable, etc., and so forth. We cannot “make” it,
but we preach it and we work in that direction. In every
country preference should be given to the struggle against
the chauvinism of the particular country, to awakening of
hatred of one’s own government, to appeals (repeated,

    

insistent, numerous, tireless) to the solidarity of the workers
of the warring countries, to their joint civil war against
the bourgeoisie.

No one will venture to guarantee when and to what extent
this preaching will be “justified” in practice: that is not
the point (only base sophists renounce revolutionary
agitation because they don’t know when the revolution will take
place). The point is to work on those lines. Only that work
is socialist, not chauvinist. And it alone will bear socialist
fruit, revolutionary fruit.

The watchword of peace now is absurd and mistaken
(especially after the betrayal by almost all the leaders up
to and including Guesde, Plekhanov, Vandervelde,
Kautsky). In practice it would mean petty-bourgeois moaning.
But we must remain revolutionaries in war conditions too.
And must preach the class struggle among the troops also.

All the best. Write more often.

Yours,
 Lenin

spirit of bourgeois patriotism and justification of tsarist Russia’s

Berne, November 17, 1914

Dear Colleague,

I have sent you today by registered post the article on
Marx and
Marxism[1] for the dictionary. It is not for me
to judge how far I have succeeded in solving the difficult
problem of squeezing the exposition into a framework of
about 75,000 letters and spaces. I will observe that I had
to compress the literature very intensively (15,000 was the
ultimatum), and I had to select the essence of various
tendencies (of course, with the majority for Marx). It was
difficult to make up my mind to renounce many quotations
from Marx. In my view, quotations are very important
for a dictionary (especially on the most controversial
questions of Marxism, which include philosophy and the agrarian
problem first and foremost). Headers of the dictionary
should have available all the most important statements
by Marx, otherwise the purpose of the dictionary would not
be achieved. That is how it seemed to me. I don’t know
either whether you will be satisfied from the point of view
of censorship: if not, perhaps we could manage to agree on
the rewording of some passages, having in mind passing the
censor. For my part, without ultimative demands from the
editorial board, I could not make up my mind to “correct”
a number of quotations and propositions of Marxism for
reasons of censorship.

I hope you will be kind enough to let me know
immediately (a postcard will do) that you have received the article.
I would ask you particularly to send the fee due to me as
soon as possible to Gospodin Mark Timofeyevich Yeliza-
    

rov, 17 Grechesky Prosp., Flat 18, Petrograd (sending it to
me here in wartime would involve the expense of an exchange
operation and would be most inconvenient for me).

With assurances that I am at your service,
 V. Ilyin

P.S. On account of the war, my library has been held up
in
Galicia,[2] and I could not find some quotations from
Marx’s works in the Russian translations. If you think it
necessary, perhaps you could request someone in Moscow to
do it? (In my view, it is not.) Incidentally, I should be
very glad if you found it possible to send me a proof of
the article, and to let me know whether partial corrections
of the proof are possible or not. If you cannot send the
proof, I hope you will be kind enough to send me an off-print.

My address: Wl. Uljanow. 11. Distelweg. 11. Bern.

November 28, 1914

Dear Friend,

I have had a telegram from
Branting[1] today that “the
newspapers confirm the arrest of five
deputies”.[2] I fear
that now we cannot doubt the fact of the arrest.

This is terrible. The government has evidently decided to
have its revenge on the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
group, and will stick at nothing. We must be ready for
the very worst: falsification of documents, forgeries, planting
of “evidence”, false witness, trial behind closed doors,
etc., etc.

I think that without such methods the government would
not succeed in getting a sentence.

Could you not try to find out the names of the six who
have been arrested?

Is K.  all right?

At all events, the work of our Party has now become
100 times more difficult. And still we shall carry it on!
Pravda has trained up thousands of class-conscious workers
out of whom, in spite of all difficulties, a new collective of
leaders—the Russian C.C. of the Party—will be formed.
It is now particularly important that you should remain in
Stockholm (or near Stockholm), and put all your energy
into establishing contacts with Petersburg. (Write whether
you have received any money as a loan: in my last letter
I put in a little note for you about this. If you have not
had any and cannot get any, we shall probably be able
to send you something; write in as much detail as possible.)
 

In Zurich a newspaper Otkliki is promised (probably the
liquidators+Trotsky) in December. In Paris a daily S.R.
Mysl (arch-philistine phrase-making, playing at “

Leftism”)[3] has begun to appear. An abundance of papers,
phrases from the intelligentsia, today r-r-revolutionary,
tomorrow...? (tomorrow they will make peace with Kautsky,
Plekhanov, the liquidationist “patriotic-chauvinist–
opportunist intelligentsia” in Russia)....

Among the working class in Russia they never had
anything, and have nothing. You cannot trust them in the
slightest.

I shake you warmly by the hand, and wish you courage.
Times are difficult, but ... we shall get through!

Yours,
 Lenin

the Bolshevik deputies of “high treason”, and all the deputies were

Dear Comrade,

I have received your letter and the English
enclosure.[2]

Many thanks!

I send you both the things you wrote about. Let us know—
if you translate them and send them off—what happens
to them.

It is said that in Hamburger Echo there was a leading
article “Über unseren Verrat an der
Internationale”,[1]

which
staled that the Germans (i.e., the German opportunist
scoundrels) are all in it, and that Plekhanov, Maslov and
Chkheidze are for
them.[3]

Is it true? And what do yon think about it?

Greetings and best wishes,
 V. Ilyin

P.S. Ask Alexander to make the acquaintance of Kobetsky
(Kobezky. Kapelwej. 514. Kjobenhavn VI) and to take
from him my letter to himself (Alexander).

It is useless to advocate a well-meaning programme of
noble wishes for peace, if we do not at the same time and in
the first place advocate the preaching of illegal
organisation and civil war of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.

N. Lenin

The European war has brought this great benefit to
international socialism, that it has exposed for all to see the

    

utter rottenness, baseness and meanness of opportunism, thereby giving a
splendid impetus to the cleansing of the working-class movement from the
dung accumulated during decades of peace.  

N. Lenin 

 
Notes

 “On Our Betrayal of the International.”—Ed.
 



[2]
The enclosure was a letter from Shaw Desmond, correspondent of the
British Social-Democratic paper The Labour Leader, which he wrote
on November 29, 1914 asking for information on the attitude of the
R.S.D.L.P. to the questions of war and peace. Lenin wrote his reply on Shaw
Desmond’s letter and in this letter.

Dear Citizen, 

Tria has passed on to me your letter of December 28, 1914.  

You are obviously mistaken. We take the stand of international
revolutionary Social-Democracy, and you of the national bourgeoisie. We are
working to bring together the workers of various (and particularly
the warring) countries, while you evidently are moving nearer to
the bourgeoisie and the government of “your” nation. We are on different
roads.

Dear Friend, 

I very much advise you to write the plan of the pamphlet in as much
detail as
possible.[2] Otherwise too much is unclear.  

One opinion I must express here and now: 

I advise you to throw out altogether § 3—the “demand (women’s)
for freedom of love”.  

That is not really a proletarian but a bourgeois demand.  

After all, what do you understand by that phrase? What can be
understood by it?  

1. Freedom from material (financial) calculations in affairs
of love?  

2. The same, from material worries?  

3. From religious prejudices?  

4. From prohibitions by Papa, etc.?  

5. From the prejudices of “society”?  

6. From the narrow circumstances of one’s environment (peasant or
petty-bourgeois or bourgeois intellectual)?  

7. From the fetters of the law, the courts and the police?  

8. From the serious element in love?  

9. From child-birth?  

10. Freedom of adultery? Etc.  

I have enumerated many shades (not all, of course). You have in mind,
of course, not nos. 8–10, but either nos. 1–7 or something
similar to nos. 1–7.  

But then for nos. 1–7 you must choose a different wording, because
freedom of love does not express this idea exactly.  
 

And the public, the readers of the pamphlet, will inevitably
understand by “freedom of love”, in general, some thing like nos. 8–10,
even without your wishing it.  

Just because in modern society the most talkative, noisy and
“top-prominent” classes understand by “freedom of love” nos. 8–10,
just for that very reason this is not a proletarian but a bourgeois demand.


For the proletariat nos. 1–2 are the most important, and then
nos. 1–7, and those, in fact, are not “freedom of love”.  

The thing is not what you subjectively “mean” by this. The
thing is the objective logic of class relations in affairs of
love.  

Friendly shake
hands![1]



W. I.

I apologise for my delay in replying: I wanted to do it yesterday, but
was prevented, and I had no time to sit down and write.  

As regards your plan for the pamphlet, my opinion was that “the demand
for freedom of love” was unclear and—independently of your will and your
wish (I emphasised this when I said that what mattered was the objective,
class relations, and not your subjective wishes)—would, in present social
conditions, turn out to be a bourgeois, not a proletarian demand.  

You do not agree.  

Very well. Let us look at the thing again.  

In order to make the unclear clear, I enumerated approximately ten
possible (and, in conditions of class discord, inevitable)
different interpretations, and in doing so re marked that interpretations
1--7, in my opinion, would be typical or characteristic of proletarian
women, and 8–10 of bourgeois women.  

If you are to refute this, you have to show (1) that these
interpretations are wrong (and then replace them by others, or indicate
which are wrong), or (2) incomplete (then you should add those which are
missing), or (3) are not divided into proletarian and bourgeois in that
way.  

You don’t do either one, or the other, or the third.  

You don’t touch on points 1–7 at all. Does this mean that you admit
them to be true (on the whole)? (What you write about the prostitution of
proletarian women and their

    

dependence: “impossibility of saying no” fully comes under points
1--7. No difference at all can be detected between us here.)  

Nor do you deny that this is a proletarian interpretation.


There remain points 8–10.  

These you “don’t quite understand” and “object” to:
“I don’t understand how it is possible” (that is what you have
written!) “to identify” (!!??) “freedom of love with” point
10....  

So it appears that I am “identifying”, while you have
undertaken to refute and demolish me?  

How so?  

Bourgeois women understand by freedom of love points
8--10—that is my thesis.  

Do you deny this? Will you say what bourgeois ladies
understand by freedom of love?  

You don’t say that. Do not literature and life really prove
that that is just how bourgeois women understand it? They prove it
completely! You tacitly admit this.  

And if that is so, the point is their class position, and it is hardly
possible and almost naïve to “refute” them.  

What you must do is separate from them clearly,
contrast with them, the proletarian point of view. One must take
into account the objective fact that otherwise they will snatch
the appropriate passages from your pamphlet, interpret them in their own
way, make your pamphlet into water pouring on their mill, distort your
ideas in the workers’ eyes, “confuse” the workers (sowing in
their minds the fear that you may be bringing them alien
ideas). And in their hands are a host of newspapers, etc.  

While you, completely forgetting the objective and class point of view,
go over to the “offensive” against me, as though I am
“identifying” freedom of love with points 8–10.... Marvellous, really
marvellous....  

“Even a fleeting passion and intimacy” are “more poetic and
cleaner” than “kisses without love” of a (vulgar and shallow) married
couple. That is what you write. And that is what you intend to write in
your pamphlet. Very good.  

Is the contrast logical? Kisses without love between a vulgar couple
are dirty. I agree. To them one should contrast ... what?... One
would think: kisses with love? While

    

you contrast them with “fleeting” (why fleeting?)  “passion” (why not
love?)—so, logically, it turns out that kisses without Love (fleeting)
are contrasted with kisses without love by married people.... Strange. For
a popular pamphlet, would it not be better to contrast
philistine-intellectual-peasant (I think they’re in my point 6 or point 5)
vulgar and dirty marriage without love to proletarian civil marriage with
love (adding, if you absolutely insist, that fleeting intimacy and
passion, too, may be dirty and may be clean). What you have arrived at is,
not the contrast of class types, but something like an
“incident”, which of course is possible. But is it a question of
particular incidents? If you take the theme of an incident, an individual
case of dirty kisses in marriage and pure ones in a fleeting intimacy, that
is a theme to be worked out in a novel (because there the whole
essence is in the individual circumstances, the analysis
of the characters and psychology of particular
types). But in a pamphlet?  

You understood my idea very well about the unsuitable quotation from
Key,[2] when you said it is “stupid” to appear in the role of
“professors of love”. Quite so. Well, and what about the role of
professors of fleeting, etc.?  

Really, I don’t want to engage in polemics at all. I would willingly
throw aside this letter and postpone matters until we can talk about
it. But I want the pamphlet to be a good one, so that no one
could tear out of it phrases which would cause you unpleasantness
(sometimes one single phrase is enough to be the spoonful of tar
in a barrel of honey), could misinterpret you. I am sure that
here, too, you wrote “without wishing it”, and the only reason why I am
sending you this letter is that you may examine the plan in greater detail
as a result of the letters than you would after a talk—and the plan, you
know, is a very important thing.  

Have you not some French socialist friend? Translate my points 1–10 to
her (as though it were from English), together with your remarks about
“fleeting”, etc., and watch her, listen to her as attentively as
possible: a little experiment as to what outside people will say,
what their impressions will be, what they will expect of the pamphlet.

 

I shake you by the hand, and wish you fewer headaches and to get better
soon.  

V. U. 

P.S. About
Baugy[3] I don’t know.... Possibly my
friend[1]

promised too much.... But what? I don’t know. The thing has been postponed,
i.e., the conflict has been postponed, not eliminated. We shall
have to fight and fight!! Shall we succeed in dissuading them? What is your
opinion?

of the central organ. The group took its name from the town of Baugy in
Switzerland, where it had its headquarters. Lenin learned of the project by
chance, from a letter which the group sent to Inessa Armand suggesting that
she should contribute to the paper. Lenin was against the publication of
such small papers and the question “The C.O. and a new newspaper” was
placed before the conference of R.S.D.L.P. organisations abroad, held in
Berne, February 27 to March 4, 1915. The conference adopted a resolution
confirming the correctness of Lenin’s line.

February 11 

Dear Friend, 

I have received your two letters, of February 4 and 5. Many thanks. As
regards sending Sotsial-Demokrat, we have given your letter to the
secretary of the dispatch committee to read. Tomorrow I shall remind him
personally, and I hope that they will do everything.  

The Parisians promised to send you Plekhanov’s little pamphlet, and we
are very surprised that you have not received it. We shall order it once
more, and get one our selves to send
you.[2] 

The two Plekhanovites of whom you wrote were here. We chatted with
them. Take notice of the little fair one (they are going back the same
way): apparently Plekhanov repelled him even more than the little dark
one. The latter, I think, is a hopeless chatterbox. But the former keeps
very quiet, and you can’t find out what is going on in his head.  

From Nashe Slovo (which is appearing in Paris in place of
Golos) we have had a letter today with a plan for a common protest
against “official social-patriotism” (on the subject of the scheme for a
London conference of socialists de la Triple
Entente[3]). Whether the conference will take place, we don’t know; we
had the other day from Litvinov a letter he transmitted from Huysmans, who
is planning something strange, calling together the Executive Committee of
the International Socialist Bureau on February 20 at The Hague, and on
February 20–25 organising in the same place personal negotiations (!!)
with the delegates from

    

Britain, France and Russia!! Astonishing!! It looks like preparations of
some kind for something Francophil and patriotic (by the way, you are
absolutely right that there are now many “phils” and few socialists. For
us both Francophils and Germanophils are one and the same = patriots,
bourgeois or their lackeys, and not socialists. The Bundists, for example,
are for the most part Germanophils and glad of the defeat of Russia. But in
what way are they any better than Plekhanov? Both are opportunists,
social-chauvinists, only of different colours. And Axelrod too).  

We have replied to Nashe Slovo that we are glad of their
proposal, and have sent them our draft
     declaration.[1]

Hopes of an agreement with them are not great, because Axelrod, it is said,
is in Paris—and Axelrod (see Nos. 86 and 87 of Golos and No. 37
of Sotsial-Demokrat) is a social-chauvinist, who wants to
reconcile Francophils and Germanophils on the basis of
social-chauvinism. Let us see what is dearer to Nashe
Slovo—anti-chauvinism or the good will of Axelrod.  

I think that both in Russia and throughout the world a new basic
grouping is coming into existence within Social-Democracy: the chauvinists
(“social-patriots”) and their friends, their defenders—and the
anti-chauvinists. In the main, this division corresponds to the division
between the opportunists and the revolutionary Social-Democrats. But it
plus précis represents, so to speak, a higher stage of
development, nearer to the socialist revolution. And among us the old
grouping (liquidators and Pravdists) is becoming out of date, and being
replaced by a new, more sensible division: social-patriots and
anti-patriots. By the way. They say that
Dan[4]==a German “social-patriot”, i.e., a Germanophil,
i.e., for Kautsky. Is this true? It looks very much like the
truth. It’s an odd thing that in the Organising
Committee[5] the split is along bourgeois lines: Francophils
(Plekhanov+Alexinsky+Maslov+Nasha Zarya) and Germanophils
(Bund+Axelrod+Dan?? etc.).  

If you don’t get any money from the Swedes, let us know:
we shall send you 100 francs. Think over very thoroughly

    

where it is best (i.e., most useful for the cause and safest
for you: this is very important: you must protect
yourself!!) to lie low, in London or in Norway, etc. It is of the
greatest importance to organise transport, even little by
little. You ought to have an interview with the
Plekhanovites who in two or three weeks will be in your place, and
come to an arrangement about all this.

All the best; I wish you courage and all good things.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

Many thanks for all your trouble and assistance, about
which you write in your last letter.

Your articles in Nashe Slovo and for
Kommunist[1] on
Scandinavian affairs have raised the following question in
my mind: 

Can one praise and find correct the position of the Left
Scandinavian Social-Democrats who reject the arming of
the people? I argued about this with Höglund in 1910 and
tried to prove to him that this was not Leftism, nor
revolutionism, but simply the philistinism of petty-bourgeois
provincials.[2] These Scandinavian petty-bourgeois have
lucked themselves away in their little countries, almost at the
North Pole, and are proud of the fact that you can’t get to
them in a month of Sundays! How can one allow that a
revolutionary class on the eve of the social revolution
should be against the arming of the people? This is not
struggle against militarism, but a cowardly attempt to
retire from the great questions of the capitalist world.
How can one “recognise” the class struggle, without
understanding its inevitable transformation at certain moments
into civil war?

It seems to me that you ought to collect material on
this, and come out resolutely against in Kommunist, and
then, for the instruction of the Scandinavians, print it
afterwards in Swedish, etc.

I should like to know your opinion about this in more
detail.
 

Bruce Glasier, in my belief, is an unsuitable contributor:
although he has a proletarian strain in him, still he is an
unbearable opportunist. You will hardly be able to go along
with him: he will start crying after two days, and saying
that he was “trapped”, that he doesn’t want and doesn’t
recognise anything of the kind.

Have you seen the book by David, and his opinion about
our
manifesto?[3]

Is there not in the Scandinavian countries any material
on the struggle of the two currents of opinion concerning
the attitude to the war? Could not one gather precise
material (reactions, assessments, resolutions) with a precise
contrasting of facts regarding the tendencies of the two
currents? Do facts confirm (in my opinion, they do) that the
opportunists—taken as a current of opinion—are, on the
whole,>chauvinists than the revolutionary Social-
Democrats? What do you think, would it not be possible to gather
and work up such material for Kommunist?

I shake your hand, and wish you all the best, 

N. Lenin

P.S. Who is this Shaw Desmond who has been giving
a lecture in the Scandinavian countries? Is the text of
his lecture available in English? Is he a conscious
revolutionary, or à la Hervé?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The magazine Kommunist was organised by Lenin and published by
the editorial board of the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat in
co-operation with G. L. Pyatakov and E. B. Bosh, who both financed the
publication. N. I. Bukharin was also on the editorial board. Only one
(double) issue appeared, in 1915.  

Lenin had intended making Kommunist the organ of the Left
Social-Democrats but serious difficulties soon arose between the editorial
board of Sotsial-Demokrat and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh. These
difficulties became more acute after the double issue had appeared.  

This issue contained Alexandra Kollontai’s article “Why Was the German
Proletariat Silent in the July Days?”  

Nashe Slovo (Our Word) printed a number of articles by
Kollontai.





[2]
Lenin criticises the incorrect position of Carl Zeth Höglund and the
Swedish, Norwegian and Swiss Left Social-Democrats in his articles “The
Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution” and “The ‘Disarmament’
Slogan” (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 77–87, 94–104).





[3]
Reference is to Eduard David’s book Die Sozialdemokratie im
Weltkrieg (Social-Democracy in the World War), published in

__PRINTERS_P593_COMMENT__ 38—01148
   

Berlin in 1917. For a criticism of this book see Lenin’s article “The Main
German Opportunist Work on the War” (see present edition, Vol. 21,
pp. 270–74).

Dear Comrade,

The weathercock (Drehscheibe) Kautsky and Co. want now,
with the help of Left phrases and a purely verbal departure
from “the policy of
August 4”,[1] to “stifle” the
revolutionary ferment which is beginning. We are now for peace,
these gentlemen will be saying together with Renaudel and
Co., striving thereby to satisfy the revolutionary masses.

There is talk of a conference of the Lefts—and it is more
than likely that dirty little souls of the Bernstein-Kautsky
type will make use of such a conference in order, once again,
to deceive the masses with the help of “passive radicalism”.

It is quite possible that sensible statesmen of both
belligerent groups now have nothing against the incipient
revolutionary ferment being stifled by an idiotic “peace
programme”.

I don’t know whether the German Lefts are already strong
enough to upset the manoeuvre of these passive (and
hypocritical) “radicals”. But you and we are independent parties.
We must do something: work out a programme of revolution,
expose the idiotic and hypocritical watchword of peace,
denounce and refute it, talk with utter frankness to the
workers—in order to tell the truth (without the base
diplomacy of the leaders of the Second International). And the
truth is this: either one supports the revolutionary ferment
which is beginning, and assists it (for this one needs the
watchword of revolution, of civil war, of illegal
organisation, etc.), or one stifles it (for this one needs the
watchword of peace, the “condemnation” of “annexations”, maybe
disarmament, etc., etc.).
 

History will show that it is we who were right, i.e., the
revolutionaries in general, not necessarily A or B.

I should like to know whether you (your Party) are able
to send your representative (knowing one of the three main
languages). And do you think it possible that both our
parties officially (in writing or verbally, better: and
verbally) should propose a joint declaration (or resolution)?

If there are only money
difficultes, let us know exactly
how much is needed. Perhaps we will be able to help.

Best greetings.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear Comrade,

The question of a conference of the “Left” is going ahead.
There has already been a first
Vorkonferenz,[3] and a second,
decisive one, will be held shortly. It is extremely important
to draw in the Left Swedes (Höglund) and the Norwegians.

Be kind enough to write
(1) whether we are in agreement
with you (or you with the C.C.), if not, wherein we differ,
and
(2) whether you will undertake to draw in the “Left”
Scandinavians.

Ad 1. You know our position from Sotsial-Demokrat. In
Russian affairs we shall not be for unity with the Chkheidze
group[4] (which Trotsky, and the O.C., and Plekhanov,
and Co. want: see The War), because this is a cover-up and
defence of Nashe Dyelo. In international affairs we shall
not be for rapprochement with Haase-Bernstein-Kautsky
(for in practice they want unity with the Südekums and to
shield them, they want to get away with Left phrases and
to change nothing in the old rotten party). We cannot
stand for the watchword of peace, because we consider it
supremely muddled, pacifist, petty-bourgeois, helping the
governments (they now want to be with one hand “for
peace”, in order to climb out of their difficulties) and
obstructing the revolutionary struggle.

In our opinion, the Left should make a common
declaration of principle
(1) unquestionably condemning the
social-chauvinists and opportunists,
(2) giving a programme
of revolutionary action (whether to say civil war or
revolutionary mass action, is not so important),
(3) against the

    

watchword of “defence of the fatherland”, etc. A
declaration of principle by the “Left”, in the name of several
countries, would have a gigantic significance (of course, not in
the spirit of the Zetkin philistinism which she got adopted
at the Women’s
Conference[5] at Berne; Zetkin evaded the
question of condemning social-chauvinism!! out of a desire
for “peace” with the Südekums+Kautsky??).

If you are not in agreement with these ladies, drop us
a line straightaway.

If you are in agreement, do take on the translation of
(1) the manifesto of the Central Committee (No. 33 of
Sotsial-Demokrat)[1]

and
(2) the Berne resolutions (No. 40
of
Sotsial-Demokrat)[2]

into Swedish and Norwegian, and
get in touch with Höglund—do they agree to prepare a
common declaration (or resolution) on such a basis (naturally
we shall not quarrel over details)? Particular speed with
this is necessary.

And so I await your reply.

Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade Wijnkoop,

The scheme with which we are now occupied, the plan
for an international declaration of principle by the Marxist
Left, is so important that we have no right to delay, and
must carry it through successfully to its conclusion,
moreover as quickly as possible. The fact that we are late with
it presents a great danger!

The article by A. P. in Berner Tagwacht (July 24) on
the Congress of the S.D.P. of Holland is extremely
important for our mutual
understanding.[1] I welcome with the
greatest joy the position taken up by you, Gorter and
Ravesteyn on the question of a people’s militia (we have
that in our programme too). An exploited class which did
not strive to possess arms, to know how to use them and
to master the military art would be a class of lackeys. The
defenders of disarmament as against a people’s militia
(there are “Lefts” of this kind in Scandinavia too: I argued
about this with Höglund in 1910) are taking up the
position of petty bourgeois, pacifists, opportunists in the small
states. But for us it is the point of view of the great states
and the revolutionary struggle (i.e.,
also of civil war) which
must be decisive. Anarchists may be against a people’s
militia, from the point of view of the social revolution
(conceived of without relation to time and space). But our
most important task now is to draw a sharp line of
demarcation between the Marxist Left on the one hand and the
opportunists (and Kautskians) and anarchists on the other.
 

One passage in the article by A. P. really revolted me,
namely the one where he says that the declaration of
principle by Mme. Roland-Hoist “completely corresponds to
the point of view of the S.D.P.”!!

From that declaration of principle, in the form in which
it was printed in Berner Tagwacht and in Internationale
Korrespondenz,[2] I see that we cannot in any circumstances
accept solidarity with Mme. Roland-Hoist. Mme.
Roland-Hoist, in my opinion, is a Dutch Kautsky or a Dutch
Trotsky. These people in principle “firmly disagree” with the
opportunists, but in practice, on all important questions, they
agree!! Mme. Roland-Hoist rejects the principle of defence
of the fatherland, i. e., she rejects social-chauvinism. That is
good. But she does not reject opportunism!! In a most lengthy
declaration there is not one word against opportunism!
There is not one clear, unambiguous word about 
revolutionary means of struggle (but in return, all the more phrases
about “idealism”, self-sacrifice, etc., which every scoundrel,
including Troelstra and Kautsky, can very willingly
accept)! Not one word about a rupture with the opportunists!
The watchword of “peace” is quite d la Kautsky! Instead
of this (and quite consistently, from the point of view of
the unprincipled “declaration of principle” of Mme.
Roland-Hoist) the advice to co-operate both with the S.D.P.
and the S.D.L.P.!! This means unity with the opportunists.

Quite like our Mr. Trotsky: “in principle firmly against
defence of the fatherland”, in practice for unity with the
Chkheidze group in the Russian Duma (i.e., with the
opponents of our group which has been exiled to Siberia, with
the best friends of the Russian social-chauvinists).

No. No. Never and in no circumstances shall we agree in
principle with the declaration of Mme. Roland-Hoist. It is
a quite thoughtless, purely platonic and hypocritical
internationalism. Just one long compromise. It is suited
(speaking politically) only to the task of forming a “Left
wing” (i.e., a “harmless minority”, a “decorative Marxist
signboard”) in the old, rotten and scoundrelly lackey parties
(the Liberal Labour parties).

Of course, we do not demand an immediate split in this
or that party, for example, in Sweden, Germany or France.
It is very possible that the time for this will be more

    

favourable (for example, in Germany) somewhat later. But in
principle we must unquestionably demand a complete break
with opportunism. The whole struggle of our Party (and of
the working-class movement in Europe generally) must be
directed against opportunism. The latter is not a current
of opinion, not a tendency; it (opportunism) has now become
the organised tool of the bourgeoisie within the
working-class movement. And furthermore: questions of the
revolutionary struggle (tactics, means, propaganda in the army,
fraternisation in the trenches, etc.) must undoubtedly be
analysed in detail, discussed, thought out, tested,
explained to the masses in the illegal press. Without this any
“recognition” of revolution remains only an empty phrase.
We have no common road with phrase-mongering (in Dutch:
“passive”) radicals.

I hope, dear Comrade Wijnkoop, that you will not take
offence at these remarks of mine. After all, we must come
to a proper agreement, in order to carry on jointly this
difficult struggle.

Please show this letter to Comrade Pannekoek and other
Dutch friends.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

P.S. I will shortly semi you the official resolution of our
Party (of 1975) on the question of the right of all nations
to
self-determination.[3] We are for this. Now, in the struggle
against the social-chauvinists, we must be more for this
than ever before.

Dear A. M.,

We are sending you the money tomorrow. Many thanks
for the news from Russia. In principle we have nothing
against an agreement; we hope that you will be extra careful.

As regards armament of the people versus disarmament,
it seems to me all the same that we cannot alter the
programme.[4] If the words about the class struggle are not an
empty phrase in the liberal sense (as they have become
with the opportunists, Kautsky and Plekhanov), how can
one object to a fact of history—the transformation of this
struggle, under certain conditions, into civil war? How
moreover can an oppressed class in general be against the
armament of the people?

To reject this means to fall into a semi-anarchist attitude
to imperialism—in my belief, this can be seen in certain
Left-wingers even among ourselves. Once there is
imperialism, they say, then we don’t need either self-determination
of nations or the armament of the people! That is a crying
error. It is precisely for the socialist revolution against
imperialism that we need both one and the other.

Is it “realisable”? Such a criterion is incorrect. Without
revolution almost the entire minimum programme is
unrealisable. Put in that way, realisability declines into
Philistinism.

It seems to me that this question (like all questions of
Social-Democratic tactics today) can be put only in
connection with the evaluation of (and reckoning with) opportunism.
And it is clear that “disarmament”, as a tactical watchword,

    

is opportunism. Moreover it is a provincial one, it stinks of
a little state, detachment from the struggle, poverty of
ideas: “it’s no business of mine”....

We are sending you the draft (individual) of a declaration
of the international
Left.[1]

We urge you to translate it and
to pass it on to the Left in Sweden and Norway, in order
to make a business-like advance to a
Verständigung[2]

with
them. Send us your observations, resp. your counterdraft,
if you wish, and secure the same from the Left in
Scandinavia.

Beste Grüsse.[3]


Yours,
 Lenin

constitution would, as the twelfth point stipulated, ensure “replacement
of the regular army by the general arming of the people”.

Dear A. M.,

We were very glad about the statement by the Norwegians
and your efforts with the
Swedes.[1] It would be devilishly
important to have a joint international statement by the
Left Marxists! (A statement of principle is the main thing,
and so far the only thing possible.)

Roland-Hoist, like Rakovsky (have you seen his French
pamphlet?), like Trotsky, in my opinion, are all the most
harmful “Kautskians”, in the sense that all of them in
various forms are for unity with the opportunists, all in
various forms embellish opportunism, all of them (in various
ways) preach eclecticism instead of revolutionary Marxism.

I think your criticism of the draft declaration does not
show (unless I am mistaken) any serious differences between
us. I think it mistaken in theory and harmful in practice
not to distinguish types of wars. We cannot be against
wars of national liberation. You quote the example of
Serbia. But if the Serbs were alone against Austria, would we
not be for the Serbs?

The essence of the thing today is the struggle between
the Great Powers for the redivision of the colonies and the
subjugation of the smaller powers.

A war of India, Persia, China and so forth with Britain
or Russia? Would we not be for India against Britain, etc.?
To call that “a civil war” is inexact, an obvious
exaggeration. It is extremely harmful to stretch the conception of
civil war beyond measure, because that blurs the essence of
the question: a war of hired workers against the capitalists
of a particular state.
 

It is the Scandinavians, apparently, who are falling into
a petty-bourgeois (and provincial, kleinstaatisch) pacifism,
repudiating “war” in general. That is not Marxist. One
has to combat this, like their rejection of the militia.

Once again greetings, and congratulations on the
Norwegian declaration!

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade Radek,

I return your
draft.[1] Not a word about social–
chauvinism and (=) opportunism and the struggle against them!!
Why such an embellishing of the evil and concealment
from the working masses of their main enemy in the
Social-Democratic parties?

Will you make an ultimatum of insisting that not a word
should be said openly about a ruthless struggle against
opportunism?

I hope to arrive two days earlier (i.e., September 2–3) if
you inform me that the Germans will also come earlier
(otherwise Zinoviev will come alone).

(Your draft is too “academic”, not a militant appeal,
not a fighting manifesto.)

Will you be sending your draft to Wijnkoop? Are you
insisting that they (the Dutch) should come?

Please send me at once the (German) translation of my
draft (about which you wrote to Wijnkoop) and the
translation of our resolution of 1913 (the nationalities question).
That makes two things.

We must make every effort to publish our pamphlet (in
German) before September 5. I am writing today to
Kasparov that he should help you and find another translator
(in Berne—Comrade Kinkel). Can you (with Kasparov)

    

work at “extra speed” and translate this pamphlet in the
course of a week? And what about the printing? Can it be
printed in three or four days? We must make every effort
and do this!

I beg you to reply immediately.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

August 23, 1915

Dear Alexander,

As regards the plan of your journey, it is very hard for
me to give you definite advice from so far
off.[2] Our
financial affairs are known to you. Nadezhda Konstantinovna has
written to you in detail (in addition to what was sent, 600
francs were promised before October 10+400 francs one
month later. In all, 1,000 francs. For the time being there
is no hope of more).

On the one hand, extreme care is essential. Have you
completely reliable papers? And all the rest?

On the other hand, it would be unquestionably useful for
the cause just now, if a fully-informed and independent
person travelled round two or three centres, made contacts,
established relations and immediately returned to Sweden,
to pass on all the contacts to us and to discuss the further
situation. This would be most important.


[[ 
Kommunist No. 1 will appear in 8–10 days; then, after
as many more, No. 2 (or Nos. 1–2 together). No. 44 of the
Central Organ will appear in a day or two. A pamphlet
about the war with all documents will come out in a
fortnight. It is already being set.

Events in Russia have completely endorsed our position,
which the social-patriot donkeys (from Alexinsky to
Chkheidze) have christened defeatism. The facts have proved that
we are right!! The military reverses are helping to shake
the foundations of tsarism, and facilitating an alliance of
the revolutionary workers of Russia and other countries.

    

People say: what will “you” do, if “you”, the revolutionaries,
defeat tsarism? I reply:
(1) our victory will fan the flames of
the “Left” movement in Germany a hundredfold;
(2) if “we”
defeated tsarism completely, we would propose peace to
all the belligerent powers on democratic terms and, if this
were rejected, we would conduct a revolutionary war.

It is clear that the advanced section of Pravdist workers,
that bulwark of our Party, has survived, in spite of terrible
devastations in its ranks. It would be extremely important
for leading groups to come together in two or three centres
(most conspiratively), establish contact with us, restore a
Bureau of the Central Committee (one exists, I think, in
Petersburg already) and the C.C. itself in Russia. They
should establish firm ties with us (if necessary, one or two
persons should be brought to Sweden for this purpose). We
would send news-sheets, leaflets, etc. The most important
thing is firm and constant relations.

Chkheidze and Co. are obviously shuffling: they are true
friends of Nashe Dyelo, Alexinsky is pleased with them
(I hope you have seen The War by Plekhanov+Alexinsky+
Co. There’s a disgrace!!) and yet they “play” at Leftism
with the help of Trotsky!! I don’t think they will succeed
in deceiving the class-conscious Pravdists.

Write what you decide. Greetings.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Will A. Kollontai agree to help us arrange in the
U.S.A. for an edition of our pamphlet in
English[1]

?

Für Alexander

Dear Friend,

Try and see Belenin and tell him, please, that he has been
co-opted a member of the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. You understand, of course,
that the maximum secrecy must be observed in this matter,
and that you must “forget” about it after passing on the
information to Belenin (I am not writing to him direct for
obvious reasons). His function during the journey is very
important: Trotsky and the company of lackeys of
opportunism abroad are straining every effort to “gloss over” the
differences, and “save” the opportunism of Nasha Zarya, by
whitewashing and lauding the Chkheidze group ( = the most
faithful friends of Nasha Zarya). It is necessary to set up
groups in Russia (of old, experienced, sensible Pravdist
workers who have fully mastered the question of the war)
and take the best of them (2–3) into the C.C. If there are
difficulties, or if doubts arise, then he could limit himself
to setting up analogous bodies (for example, “the leading
All-Russia Workers’ Group” or “Committee”, etc.; it’s not
the name that counts, of course).

Your connections and your knowledge of old and
experienced workers will help you to give advice to Belenin, who,
of course, will treat this work with exceptional seriousness
and caution. And the most important thing is that he should
now be extremely careful, making a short trip and bringing
back all the contacts.
 

Best greetings! Drop me a line directly you receive this
letter.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. The pamphlet will appear earlier than I thought.
I have already received part of the proofs. Probably in a
week or ten days we shall have both the pamphlet and
No. 1–2 of Kommunist.

There will now be three members of the C.C. abroad. In
Russia there are a number of candidate members (workers)
and arrested members of the C.C. (also workers, leading
Pravdists).




P.P.S. Tomorrow you will get a more detailed letter from
Nadezhda Konstantinovna. Treat it with the utmost
attention.

October 10, 1915

Dear Friend,

Tomorrow we are publishing two issues of the Central
Organ at the same time—No. 45–46 (devoted to the
Zimmerwald Conference) and No. 47, containing news from Russia
and the “theses” on
tactics.[1]

These theses consist partly
of replies to the questions which we touched on in our
correspondence, and you in your talks with N. I., etc. I shall
await your comments.

Have you received the Russian text of the pamphlet
Socialism and War?

(In parenthesis: A. M. has sent in a criticism of the
German text, and I replied to her in a detailed letter to America.
If you are interested, ask her to send it to you. About her
leaflet I wrote to her at Bergen, asking permission to make
corrections. There is no reply. I am afraid I shall have to
write to America, and that means a big delay.)

News from Russia testifies to the growing revolutionary
mood and movement, though to all appearances this is
not yet the beginning of revolution.

The most important thing for us now is to establish
contacts and make them regular (this is quite possible by
correspondence; consider whether one copy of the paper and
manifestos cannot be sent in a thin binding). Let us hope
that Belenin will succeed in organising this. Otherwise
one cannot dream of any systematic, connected work.
 

Pay special attention to the thesis about the Soviet of
Workers’ Deputies. One must be careful with this thing:
200 or 300 leaders might be arrested!! Except in connection
with an insurrection, the “strength” of a Soviet of Workers’
Deputies is an illusion. One should not give way to it.
All the best.

Yours,
 Lenin

Could not one organise the transcribing of such articles
in the Central Organ as “Eleven Theses” in chemical ink,
for rapid delivery to Petersburg? Think it over well.

November 9, 1915

Dear A. M.,

Only yesterday did we get your letter of October 18 from
Milwaukee. Letters take a terribly long time! You have
not yet received my letter (and Nos. 45–46 and 47 of 
Sotsial-Demokrat) about Zimmerwald, and containing all the
replies to your questions; yet that letter was written more than
a month ago. Try at any rate to calculate where you will be
(approximately, in six weeks’ time) and give us addresses
(for letters to you), so that they arrive nearer.

As regards the New York Volkszeitung, Grimm assured me
today that they are quite Kautskian! Is that the case? I
think our German
pamphlet[1]

might help you to determine
the “strength” of their internationalism. Have you had it?
(500 copies were sent to you.)

In a few days we are publishing here (in German, and then
we hope to put it out in French and, if we can manage the
money, in Italian) a little pamphlet on behalf of the 
Zimmerwald Left. Under this name we should like to launch into
international circulation, as widely as possible, our Left
group at Zimmerwald (the C.C. + the Polish Social–
Democrats+the Letts+the Swedes+the Norwegians+1 German+
1 Swiss) with its draft resolution and manifesto (printed in No.
45–46 of Sotsial-Demokrat). The little pamphlet (20–30–35
thousand letters and spaces) will contain these two
documents and a small
introduction.[3] We rely on you to
publish it in America in English too (for it is hopeless to do this

    

in England: it has to be brought there from America) and,
if possible, in other languages. This is to be the first
publication by the nucleus of Left Social-Democrats of all countries,
who have a clear, exact and full reply to the question of
what is to be done and in which direction to go. It would be
most important if you could succeed in publishing this in
America, circulating it as widely as possible and 
establishing firm publishing links (Charles Kerr (N.B.) at Chicago;
the Appeal to
Reason[2]

at Kansas, etc.), for it is generally
most important for us to come out in various languages (you
could do a great deal in this respect).

As regards money, I see with distress from your letter
that so far you have not managed to collect anything for
the Central Committee. Perhaps this “Manifesto of the
Left” will help....

I never doubted that Hillquit would be for Kautsky and
even to the right of him, because I saw him at Stuttgart (1907)
and heard how afterwards he defended the prohibition against
bringing yellow
peopl einto America (an “internationalist”)....

The Zimmerwald Manifesto itself is inadequate; Kautsky
and Co. are ready to put up with it, on condition that there is
“not a step further”. We don’t accept this, because it is 
complete hypocrisy. So that if there are people in America who
are afraid even of the Zimmerwald Manifesto, you can brush
them aside, and bring in only those who are more Left
than the Zimmerwald Manifesto.

I shake you by the hand and wish you every success!

Yours,
 Lenin

(Ulianow. Seidenweg. 4a. III. Bern)

Try establishing contact with them—if only in writing, should

sure to sound them out with our resolution of the “Zimmerwald Left”.
And what is Eugene Debs? He sometimes writes in a revolutionary
way. Or is he also a wet-rag à la Kautsky?

Write when you will again be in New York,
and for how many days.
Try everywhere to see (if only for 5 minutes)
the local Bolsheviks, to
“refresh” them and get them in touch with us.—Lenin

January 11, 1916

Dear Alexei Maximovich,

I am sending you at the Letopis address, not for Letopis
but for the publishing house, the manuscript of a pamphlet
and request you to publish
it.[2]

I have tried in as popular a form as possible to set forth
new data about America which, I am convinced, are
particularly suitable for popularising Marxism and
substantiating it by means of facts. I hope I have succeeded in
setting out these important data clearly and
comprehensibly for the new sections of the reading public which are
multiplying in Russia and need an explanation of the world’s
economic evolution.

I should like to continue, and subsequently also to
publish, a second part—about Germany.

I am setting to work on a pamphlet about
imperialism.[1]


Owing to war-time conditions I am in extreme need of
earnings, and would therefore ask, if it is possible and will
not embarrass you too much, to speed up publication of
the pamphlet.

Yours with respect,
 V. Ilyin

The address is Mr. Wl. Oulianoff, Seidenweg, 4-a, Berne,
(Suisse).

Dear Friend,

As regards your letter and its mention of the current
reproach that I am “uncompromising”, I should like to
discuss the subject with you in greater detail.

As regards James, he never understood politics and was
always against the split. James is a wonderful person, but
on these subjects his judgements are profoundly wrong.

In Russia (and now in the new International too) the
question of a split is the basic one. Any compromise here would
be a crime. I know well how many good people (James,
Galyorka, the Petrograd “friends” among the intellectuals)
were against the split in the Duma group. All of them were
1,000 times wrong. The split was essential. And the split
with Chkheidze and Co. now, too, is absolutely essential.
All who waver on this subject are enemies of the proletariat,
and we must be uncompromising with them.

But who is wavering? Not only Trotsky and Co. but also
Yuri+Eug. B. (as late as last summer they were “creating
scenes” on account of Chkheidze!!). Then the Poles (the
opposition). In their Gazeta Robotnicza No. 25, there is
their resolution: once again for manoeuvring, as in Brussels
on July 3 (16), 1914.

With them an uncompromising attitude is obligatory.

Radek is the best of them; it was useful to work with him
(for the
Zimmerwarld Left as well, by the way), and we did
work. But Radek is also wavering. And our tactics here are
two-sided (this Yuri+Nik. Iv. absolutely could not or would
not understand): on the one hand, to help Radek to move

    

left, to unite all who could be united for the Zimmerwald
Left. On the other hand, not to allow one iota of wavering
on the basic issue.

The basic issue is the break with the O.C., with Chkheidze
and Co.

The Poles are wavering, and published a most
black-guardly resolution after No. 1 of Kommunist.

The conclusion?

Either to hang on to the title of Kommunist, and open
the door to squabbling and wavering, to letters to the editor
(from Radek, Bronski, perhaps Pannekoek and others),
complaints, whining, gossip, etc.

Not on any account.

This would be harmful to the cause.

It means helping the scoundrels of the O.C., Chkheidze
and Co.

Not on any account.

Kommunist was a temporary bloc to achieve a definite
object. The object has been achieved: the journal was
published, the rapprochement attained (then it was possible,
before Zimmerwald). Now we have to go by another road,
to go further.

Kommunist has become harmful. It has to be stopped,
and replaced by a different title: Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata
(edited by the editorial board of
“Sotsial-Demokrat”).[2]

Only in this way will we avoid squabbling, avoid
wavering.

In Russia, is there also discord? Oh, of course! But it is
not our business to increase it. Let Chkheidze and Co.,
Trotsky and Co. busy themselves with increasing the discord
(that is their “profession”). Our job is to pursue our own line.
The fruits of such work are manifest: the Petrograd workers
are 100 times better than the Petrograd intellectuals (even
the “sympathisers”...).

We had to make temporary concessions to the “trio” (Yuri
+ Eug. Bosh+Nik. Iv.), because at that time it was
impossible to bring out the journal otherwise (now it is possible);
and the main thing was that we had not yet seen Eug. Bosh+
Yuri at work, and could hope that the work would lead
them upwards.

But they went downwards.
 

And the temporary alliance must be dissolved. Only
in that way will the cause not suffer. Only in that way will
they too learn.

For we are not against discussion. We are against editorial
rights for those who displayed unforgivable vacillation (
perhaps owing to their youth? then we shall wait: perhaps in
five years’ time they will straighten themselves out).

Nik. Iv. is an economist who studies seriously, and in
this we have always supported him. But he is (1) credulous
where gossip is concerned and (2) devilishly unstable in
politics.

The war pushed him towards semi-anarchist ideas. At
the conference which adopted the Berne resolutions (the
spring of
1915)[3] he produced theses (I have them!) which
were the height of stupidity, a disgrace, semi-anarchism.

I attacked sharply. Yuri and Eug. Bosh listened and
remained satisfied that I did not allow any falling away to
the left (they declared at the time their complete
disagreement with N. Iv.).

Six months passed. Nik. Iv. studies economics. He doesn’t
occupy himself with politics.

And lo and behold, on the question of self-determination,
he serves us up the same nonsense. Eug. Bosh+Yuri sign it!!
(Take their “theses” from N. Iv., and my reply to
him.[4])

Yet the question is an important one. It is an essential
question. It is inextricably bound up with the question of
annexations—a most topical question.

They didn’t think it out. They didn’t read. They didn’t
study. They listened two or three times to Radek (he has the
old “Polish” disease: he is confused on this)—and signed.

That is a scandal. It is a disgrace. These are not editors.
We must refute such people, expose them, give them time
to study and think, and be in no hurry to humour them:
“Here are editorial rights for you, distribute your nonsense
among the workers!!”

If that is allowed, they will bring matters to polemics in
the press—and then I will be obliged to call them “
imperialist Economists”, and demonstrate their complete emptiness,
the completely unserious and unthought-out character of
their ideas. Polemics in the press will drive them away for
years.
 

But if we stop Kommunist now, they will think it over
and drop their nonsense: they will read and become convinced.
Come on, dear friends, write a serious pamphlet, if you
proclaim that you have “differences” on policy (which you
have never studied or worked on), let’s have it! They will
think it over, and not produce it. And in a few months they
will be “cured”.

That’s how it has been in the past. So it will be in the
future.

On the question of annexations (and of self-
determination) our position (the resolution of
1913)[1]

has been 
completely confirmed by the war. And this question has become
a topical one. While Radek+the Dutchmen (Gorter and
Pannekoek) have obviously got muddled on this. In Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata we shall explain this affair again and
again.

We must conduct matters so as to:

(1) stop Kommunist;

(2)  in publishing the miscellany about the
Jews,[5] give
Yuri+Eug. Bosh as much humouring, rights and privileges
as possible (it won’t harm the cause in this case). Detailed
conditions in a written agreement;

(3) the same as regards their transport group (take their
regulations and our amendments to them);

(4) publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata under the
editorship of the editorial board of Sotsial-Demokrat.

We shall invite them to contribute. We shall say to them:
you have differences? Prepare a serious pamphlet! We shall
undertake to print it. (They won’t write it, because they
haven’t even begun to think seriously about the question;
they haven’t even studied it!!)

Now that will be a business-like policy.

Eug. Bosh has long been intending to go to Russia.
There she could be useful. Here she has nothing to do, and
she will invent something to do.

Do you know that affiction of life abroad: “inventing”
things to do for people stranded abroad? A terrible
affliction.
 

Well, that’s all for the time being. Gather all the
documents and put yourself abreast of the facts. We shall talk
about it again and again.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I attach a copy of my reply to N. I. Bukharin on the
subject of what the new “differences” mean.

Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata (Social-Democratic Review) was
published by the editorial board of the central organ of the R.S.D.L.P.,
the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat, under Lenin’s direct
supervision. Two issues appeared: No. 1 in October, and No. 2 in December
1916.





[3]
Reference is to the conference of the R.S.D.L.P. sections abroad, which
was held from February 27 to March 4, 1915 in Berne (Switzerland).  

In his report to the conference on “The War and the Tasks of the
Party” Lenin dealt with the most vital questions of Bolshevik strategy and
tactics during the imperialist war.  

Bukharin put forward theses in defence of anti-Marxist views, which
Lenin characterised as a trend of “imperialist Economism”.  

The conference passed the resolutions written by Lenin on the character
of the war, on the slogan “defence of the fatherland” on the slogans of
revolutionary Social-Democracy, on the attitude to other parties and
groups, etc. (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 158–64).

Reference is to Lenin’s reply to Bukharin, which criticised the theses
“On the Self-Determination Slogan” that had been sent to the editors of
Sotsial-Demokrat over the signatures of Bukharin, Pyatakov and
Eugène Bosh in November 1915. Lenin also criticised these “theses”
in his articles “The Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism”, “Reply to
P. Kievsky (Y. Pyatakov)” and “A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist
Economism” (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 13–21, 22–27 and 28–76).

Jews in Russia collected by Shlyapnikov during his trip.  The project was
never realised.

May 21, 1910

Dear Grigory,

I don’t want to turn our correspondence into an
altercation. The question is a serious one and, although I have
discussed it more than once, I will repeat my views since it is
a necessity.

After more than six months’ work with the “publishers”
(from Kiev) and several months of thinking over this
experience from every point of view, the editorial board of
the Central Organ sent them in the winter of 1915 a letter
which you also signed. In this letter the editorial board
stated that it was giving up participation in Kommunist,
on account of a number of considerations which were set
forth in exceptional detail, took up a great deal of space in
our letter, and amounted to this: that we could not assume
Party responsibility for such co-editors, that their attitude
to the cause was a non-Party one, and that we must regard
the temporary attempt to reach understanding as
unsuccessful.

We decided to publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.

Then you began to have hesitations, which led to our last
talk at Kienthal. I made a concession to you by agreeing
to an attempt to restore relations, on the condition that
(1)
there should be an agreement between the editorial board
of the Central Organ and the publishers for each issue;
(2)
they should give up their group position of an “
imperialist economic” character, their “playing” on the differences
with Radek, etc.

These conditions were not written down, and you now
dispute them. But that dispute has become unimportant,

    

since you yourself have set forth in writing, in your draft
letter to A., your conditions, and the publishers have not
accepted even these! (and you had been assuring me that the
question was settled, that they would not insist on equal
rights!).

The fact is, consequently, that if, even after our meeting
at Kienthal, one were to accept your “interpretation”, i.e.,
that I had laid down more extensive conditions than you,
even so, your lesser conditions have also been rejected by
the publishers.

It is obvious that your direct and unquestionable duty
after this was to attack the publishers with all your strength,
to break with them for good, and to use every effort to prove
to Alexander that it was impossible to have any dealings
with these gentry as editors of a leading journal.

Instead of this you propose to surrender to them, to
renounce all conditions and to withdraw the letter written
by the editorial board of the Central Organ which you
yourself signed! And this on the pretext that “they should not
be taken seriously”. In reality, what you are proposing is
that your policy should not be taken seriously. You reduce
the letter from the editorial board to devil knows what,
abjure your own point of view and give the right to the
publishers to draw the conclusion that the editorial board of
the Central Organ was merely throwing its weight about!

These are no longer hesitations, these are hesitations
cubed, which are turning into something much worse.

It remains for me only to repeat for the last time why I
don’t enter Kommunist, why I consider it anti-Party and
harmful, why I maintain the position of the letter from the
editorial board of the Central Organ breaking with the
publishers.

We concluded a temporary “federation” with the
publishers, and called it a “federation” in so many words, quite
definitely making a reservation about its temporary
character, “as an experiment”. When we concluded this temporary
alliance, the publishers were opposing the wobblings of
Bukharin (at the Conference in Berne in March 1915), and there
was not a single fact pointing to any rapprochement of this
group of three (the publishers + Bukharin) with special
views of their own.
 

But after the very first number of the journal they did
come together in this way, and when, after a long
preliminary correspondence, I called their trend “imperialist
Economism”, you wrote to me that you agreed. This was in
March 1910. It confirmed once more the most detailed letter
from the editorial hoard of the Central Organ written during
the winter.

The Party—and international—situation now is such that
the Central Committee must continue to go ahead
independently, not lying its hands either in Russian or in
international affairs. The “publishers”, good for nothing as writers
and as politicians (which the editorial board of the Central
Organ was obliged to recognise in its winter letter), want to
tie us down with an agreement about equal rights, i.e., we
must agree to grant equal rights to a lady who hasn’t written
a single line and doesn’t understand a single thing, and to a
“young man” who is entirely under her influence. And they
will make use of this equality to play on our differences
with Radek, with Bukharin and others!

It is simply madness to agree to equal rights on such
conditions, it means ruining all the work.

It is not true that they want “only a discussion”. They
have every opportunity for a discussion. They have money.
Nearly a year has gone by. Why don’t they write, why
don’t they publish discussion pamphlets? Because they
don’t want to take responsibility themselves! That is clear.
And it is this that constitutes their mockery of Party
principles, because anyone who proclaims that he has differences
must think out his case, come forward openly, face his
responsibility, and not “play” and not aspire to “equality”
when the Party does not even know the position they take
up (and when they have no position).

It is a fact that Bukharin stumbles at every step into
the views which he set forth in writing in March 1915 (at the
Conference), and which you also rejected. You admitted this
fact by agreeing in March 1916 (a year later) with my
assessment of “imperialist Economism”.

By granting “equality”, you grant equality in face of
the Party to the wobblings of Bukharin! You tie our hands
and encourage these wobblings. That is an insane policy.

You know that Radek, in the first place, was so “

    

offended” (at our insistence on the printing of our theses in
Pannekoek’s
journal[2]) that—as you yourself wrote to me in
March 1916—he carries on “no team work” with you! And
the differences with him have not disappeared; on the
contrary, you yourself agreed with me that his estimate of the
Irish insurrection was a philistine one. And you propose to
give “equality” to publishers who hide behind Radek,
playing (for 2,000 francs!) on our differences with him!!
This is an insane policy.

Secondly, Radek is one thing and the editorial board of
his paper (Gazeta Robotnicza) is another. That this paper
has also started a game (using the Chkheidze group, Trotsky,
etc.) you yourself have admitted. Remember that this
paper appeared in February 1916, and that the letter of
the Committee of Organisations
Abroad[1]
against it was
worked out with your participation. Well then, is it serious
politics if we now in our leading journal grant “equality”
to people who want to make their career by “utilising” our
struggle with the Poles, who betrayed us to Vandervelde
and Kautsky on July 3 (16), 1914??

Thirdly, you know that at Kienthal Radek wanted to
build up a majority against us among the Left, at the
meeting of the Left, making use of Fröhlich, the Robmann
woman, etc., and that an ultimatum was required to force him
to recognise the independence of our Central Committee.
What new “game” will these people make of this when the
question arises of the attitude to Junius (the question has
already arisen), or of a “mechanical separation” from the
Kautskians and others! Do you guarantee that there will
be none?? If you do, this would amount on your part to
renouncing all our policy. If you don’t, then it is insane to
tie our hands after this in the editorial board of our leading
journal.

In no circumstances do I accept this insane policy. This
is my final decision. I continue to think that only the
publication of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata disentangles the affair
(which you want to put in a hopeless tangle). Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata groups around us a number of most useful
workers (Varin, Safarov, the Letts, etc.), detaches Bukharin

    

from the publishers to us, enables us to lead the Party (and
the international Left) and not to march at the tail of ...
Madam Publisher.

Write to me precisely what your decision is. Formally
the matters now stand in this way, that the editorial board
of the Central Organ has broken with Kommunist, and its
final attempt (even your lesser conditions) has been rejected.
That means that we must announce in print that Kommunist
has stopped, and that Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata is going
to appear.

I shake your hand and send you salut.

V. U.

Two issues were published: No. 1 in January and No. 2 in April 1916. Its
official publishers were Henriette Roland-Hoist and Anton Pannekoek. Lenin
took an active part in the foundation of the

   

magazine and, after the publication of No. 1, in organising its translation
into French, so that it could be more widely distributed.

Dear A.,

Evidently there has been an interruption in our
correspondence, and quite a number of misunderstandings have
been caused by your not receiving our second letter sent to
Stockholm. Otherwise I cannot understand how you can write
that we don’t answer your questions. We replied to 
everything in the greatest detail;
it was you who didn’t reply to
us. N. K. is writing very often; we will have to be patient
and repeat some things in order to achieve results. It is
essential to maintain regular correspondence.

About Kommunist you write to me that the split with
Chkheidze arouses no doubts. In whom? In Bukharin and Co.!
But what I wrote was that this relates not to Bukharin
and Co. but to Radek and Co.

Kommunist was our temporary bloc with two groups or
elements—(1) Bukharin and Co.,
(2) Radek and Co. While it
was possible to march together with them, this was the
right thing to do.
Now it is not—and we must temporarily
part or, more correctly, move away.

The Poles adopted in the summer of 1915 (after No. 1–2
of Kommunist) and printed only in 1916 a resolution which
once again showed their wobblings on the question of
Chkheidze.
Is it reasonable now to afford them the possibility
and right (they are, after all, staff members of Kommunist!!)
to muscle in and spoil the journal with their squabbling??

In my belief, it is not reasonable. It is much more useful
for the cause to take another title (Sbornik Sotsial–
Demokrata) and wait a while, until the Poles have learned better
(or until they come under Germany) or until the situation
changes.
 

Further. About Bukharin and Co. I will certainly send
you (though not very soon, because it depends on a journey
to Berne) Bukharin’s “theses” of the spring of 1915. Then
you will see what it is all about:

1) In the spring of 1915 Bukharin (at the Conference!)
writes theses in which he is visibly rolling down into the
swamp. The
Japanese[2] are against him. (Therefore we
temporarily accept the maximum of concessions in 
Kommunist,
in order to create a form convenient for clearing up the
affair: shall we succeed in overcoming Bukharin’s
waverings “in comradely fashion”? will E. B., who calls herself
a Bolshevik, help in this or not?)

2) In the summer of 1915 (or approaching the autumn)
Bukharin-H^e Japanese, now as a group of three, sign the
theses about self-determination. Utterly wrong, in our
opinion, and a repetition of Bukharin’s mistakes.

3) At the beginning of 1916 Bukharin on the question of
the “Dutch Programme” (from No. 3 of the Bulletin of the
I.S.C.) again returns to the ideas of his spring theses of
1915!!!

The conclusion? A bloc is impossible in this case also.
We must wait until Bukharin’s waverings have ceased.
A journal which would be an organ of Polish-Bukharin
waverings would be harmful. It would be harmful in such
a situation to cling to the old title, and not to be capable
of selecting another (Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata).

The non-Party and dishonest behaviour of the Japanese
lies in this, that they want to throw the responsibility for
their wobblings on us. Excuse us, kind friends, we shall not
allow you to do this! If you want to be Party people, you
will help us partly in money to publish Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata, where we (after all, we are not wobbling) will
analyse your mistakes in comradely fashion without naming
you, not giving the enemy the chance to rejoice and gloat.

Moreover, if the Japanese took seriously the most serious
question of differences (abroad il n’y a qu’un
pas[1]

to a
separate faction!! You can believe me, I’ve been seeing this
happen for about 20 years!!), they would force themselves
to study the difference, think it over, work at it (they did

    

not think and did not study, but, simply blurted out the
first thing that came into their heads). They would have
given a full statement of their differences, either in a
manuscript for an intimate circle of leading comrades (who could
have helped in not giving publicity to the question in the
press), or in a pamphlet if they wanted to “go into print”
(they’ve got the money).

Then they themselves would he answering for their “ideas”.
That is essential. If you want to teach the workers now
truths—answer for them, and don’t throw responsibility on
us, don’t hide behind us (we are nobodies, let Lenin and Co.
answer to the Party for the “discussion”, i.e., for the
gloating of our enemies).

No, kind friends!! That won’t wash!! I am not going to
answer for your wobblings. We shall publish Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata even without your help, Messrs. Japanese.
We shall grant you a postponement: think it over, clear up
your ideas, decide finally whether you want to assume
responsibility for a new muddle or not. If all you want is to
“match” us against the Poles and the Dutch in the Russian
press, that we won’t allow you to do.

This is the situation, these are my views; and I repeat that
I will certainly send you Bukharin’s spring theses, so that
you can judge the whole situation according to the
documents.

N. K. is writing today about self-determination. We are
not for fragmentation. But what about the question of
annexations? Bukharin and Co. (just like Radek with Rosa
Luxemburg and Pannekoek) have not thought over what
it means to be “against old and new annexations” (the
formula in the press drawn up by Radek)?? Why, that is “
self-determination of nations”, only expressed in other words!

Well, so long until next time.

Yours,
 Lenin

July 2, 1916

Dear M. N.,

I am sending you the
manuscript[1]

today by registered
post. All the material, the plan and the greater part of the
work were already completed on the plan as ordered, 5 
signatures (200 manuscript pages), so that to cut it down once
more to 3 signatures was absolutely impossible. It will be
terribly disappointing if they don’t publish it! Wouldn’t
it be possible at least to get it printed in the journal of
the same
publisher?[3] Unfortunately, for some reason my
correspondence with him has lapsed.... As regards the name
of the author, I would, of course, prefer my usual pseudonym.
If that is inconvenient, I suggest another: N. Lenivtsyn.
Or if you want to, take any other. As regards the notes, I
would earnestly ask you to retain them; you will see from
No. 101 that they are exceptionally important for me. And
then in Russia the students, etc., are also readers: they
need to have the literature indicated to them. I deliberately
selected a most economical system (in the sense of space and
paper). Using small type, 7 manuscript pages mean
something like two pages of print. I particularly ask you to leave
in the notes, or to appeal to the publisher to leave them.
As regards the title: if the one given is inconvenient, if it
is desirable to avoid the word imperialism, then put in:
“The Basic Peculiarities of Contemporary Capitalism.” (The
subheading, “A Popular Outline”, is unquestionably

    

necessary, because a number of important matters are set forth
in that style.) The first sheet with a list of chapters, some
of which have headings that are perhaps not quite
convenient from the point of view of the restrictions, I am sending
for you. If you find it more convenient and safer, retain
it and don’t send it further. Altogether it would be very
pleasant if both could be printed in the journal of the same
publisher. If you see nothing inconvenient in this, drop
them a line about it. I shall be very grateful to you. I shake
your hand and send my best greetings.

P.S. I strove with all my might to adapt myself to the
“restrictions”. It’s terribly difficult for me and I feel there
is a great deal of unevenness on account of this. But it can’t
be helped!

Bukharin’s article is beyond question
unsuitable.[2]
There is not any shadow of a “theory of the imperialist
state”. There is a summary of data about the growth of
state capitalism, and nothing else. To fill an illegal journal
with this most legal material would be absurd. It must be
rejected (with supreme politeness, promising every assistance
in getting it published
legally).[1]


But perhaps we had better wait for Yuri’s article, and
not write to Bukharin for the time being.

We should wait, too, with the letter to Bukharin about
their “faction”, otherwise he will think that we have
rejected it out of “factionalism”.

To pose the question of the “epoch” and the “present
war”, as though they were “extremes”, is just what is meant
by falling into eclecticism. Just as though our aim were to
strike the “happy mean” between “extremes”!!!

The problem is to give a correct definition of the
relationship of the epoch to the present war. This has been done
both in the resolutions and in my articles:
 ||| 

“the present
imperialist war is not an exception, but a typical phenomenon
in the imperialist epoch.”
[[The typical is not the unique.]]

  ||



One cannot understand the present war without
understanding the epoch.

When people say Ibis about the epoch, this is not just a
phrase. It is correct. And your quotations from my old
articles say only that. They are correct.
 

But when people draw from this the conclusion, as they
have begun to do, that “in the epoch of imperialism there
cannot be national wars”, that is nonsense. It is an obvious
error—historical and political and logical (for an epoch is
a sum of varied phenomena, in which in addition to the
typical there is always something else).

And you repeat this error, when you write in your
remarks:


||| 

“Small countries cannot in the present epoch defend their
fatherland.”


[=the vulgarisers]



Untrue!! This is just the error of Junius, Radek, the
“disarmers” and the Japanese!!

One should say: “Small countries, too, cannot in
imperialist wars, which are most typical of the current imperialist
epoch, defend their fatherland.”

That is quite different.

In this difference lies the whole essence of the case against
the vulgarisers. And it’s just the essence which you haven’t
noticed.

Grimm repeats the error of the vulgarisers, and yon
indulge him by providing a wrong formulation. On the
contrary, it is just now that we must (both in talks and in
articles) refute the vulgarisers for Grimm’s benefit.

We are not at all against “defence of the fatherland” in
general, not against “defensive wars” in general. You will
never find that nonsense in a single resolution (or in any of
my articles).

NB ||| 

We are against defence of the fatherland and
a defensive position in the imperialist war of 1914–16 and in
other imperialist wars, typical of the imperialist epoch.
But in the imperialist epoch there may be also
“just”, “
defensive”, revolutionary wars [[namely (1) national, (2) civil,
(3) socialist and suchlike.]]


 

Notes
 

[1]
Privately, in my own name, I will advise Bukharin to change
the title and retain only the economic part. For the political part is
quite incomplete, not thought out, useless.—Lenin
 



[2]
For Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata Bukharin wrote an article called
“On the Theory of the Imperialist State”, but because of its mistaken
anti-Marxist propositions concerning the question of the state and the
dictatorship of the proletariat the article was rejected by the editors.

Dear Com.,

Unfortunately we cannot print the article “On the Theory
of the Imperialist State”. As it turns out, so much space is
occupied with material from Russia that all other subjects
are restricted, and there is not enough money. Things are
difficult.

But the main thing is not that. The main thing is some
defects in the article.

The title does not correspond to the contents. The article
consists of two parts, the combination of which has been
insufficiently thought out:
(1) about the stale in general,
and
(2) about state capitalism and its growth (especially in
Germany). The second part, is good and useful, but
nine-tenths legal. We would advise you to print it in one of the
legal reviews (if not in Letopis), after very little alteration,
and would be ready to do everything we can to help such
publication.

The first part touches on a subject of tremendous
importance in principle, but that’s just it—it only touches on it.
We cannot, when publishing a review once a year, print on
such a basic question of theory an article which has been
insufficiently thought out. Leaving aside the polemic against
Gumplowicz, etc. (that would also be better worked over
and developed into a legal article), we must point out a
number of extremely inexact formulations by the author.

Marxism is a “sociological” (???) “theory of the state”;
the state==the “general” (?) organisation of the ruling classes;
the quotations from Engels are broken off just at those

    

points which are particularly important, if you are discussing
this subject. The distinction between the Marxists and the
anarchists on the question of the state (pp. 15–16) has been
defined absolutely incorrectly: if you are to deal with this
subject, you must speak not in that way; you must not speak in
that way. The conclusion (the author gives it in italics):
“Social-Democracy must intensively underline its hostility
in principle to the state power” (p. 53)—[compare: the
proletariat creates “its provisional state organisation of power”
(p. 54) (“state organisation of power”!?)]—is also either
supremely inexact, or incorrect.

Our advice is to work up into legal articles
(α) the
section about state capitalism and
(β) the polemic with
Gumplowicz and Co. Leave the rest to mature. That is our
conviction.

Dear Friend,

Evidently Belenin’s decision about his “trip” has already
been taken, judging by the letter which Grigory has sent me
today. And the time is quite short! Yet we have particular
reason to exchange letters and come to an understanding
with him: this is now incredibly important. Therefore I
most earnestly request you to take all possible steps to see
Belenin personally, to pass on to him all that follows, and
frankly and also in detail write to me (without fail!) how
matters stand, i. e., whether or not there are difference?,
divergencies, etc., between us and Belenin, and what they
are (and how to eliminate them, if they exist).

The elimination of
James[4] (I earnestly ask you not to
say one word about this elimination to a single person
abroad: you cannot imagine, how dangerous in all respects is
chatter abroad on these subjects, and in connection with
such events)—the elimination of James makes the position
critical and once again raises the question of the general
plan of work.

In my convinced opinion, this plan is composed, first,
of the theoretical line, secondly, of the most immediate
tactical tasks and, thirdly, of direct organisational tasks.

(1) On the first point, the order of the day now is not only
the continuation of the line we have endorsed (against
tsarism, etc.) in our resolutions and
pamphlet[1]

(this line has

    

been remarkably confirmed by events, by the split in
Britain,[5] etc.), but also cleansing it of the stupidities which
have accumulated, and the muddle about rejecting
democracy (this includes disarmament, repudiation of self–
determination, the theoretically wrong rejection “in general” of
defence of the fatherland, the wobblings on the question
of the role and significance of the state in general, etc.).

It will be an extreme pity if Belenin does not receive my
article in reply to Kievsky (just yesterday it was sent to
be transcribed, and will be ready only in a few days). What
are we to do? Don’t neglect the necessity of coming to an
understanding on theoretical questions: really and truly,
it is essential for work in such difficult times. Think over
whether we could not put into effect the following plan (or
something similar); I am beginning to realise that
Belenin’s wife is not in America, as I thought, but in Spain,
through which Belenin will of course travel now. Could we
not organise the copying and passing on of manuscripts to
his wife in Spain? In that case perhaps my article, too, even
if sent in a week from now, would reach Belenin in time,
because he will certainly spend a few days in Spain.

Think it over; apart from this special case, regular
correspondence with Belenin’s wife, and with Spain in general,
is extremely important. Spain is a supremely important point
just now, because it is still more convenient to work there
than in Britain and elsewhere.

I cannot dwell more fully on theoretical agreement. The
enemy has already seized on the stupid repudiation of
the significance of democracy
(Potresov[6] in No. 1 of Dyelo).
Bazarov has made a fool of himself in Letopis. Bogdanov is
talking another kind of balderdash, but also balderdash in
Letopis. An exceptionally suspicious bloc of the Machists
and the O.C.–ists has come into being there. A shameful
bloc! It’s hardly likely that we can break it up.... Should
we perhaps try a bloc with the Machists against, the O.C.–
ists? Hardly likely to succeed!! Gorky is always supremely
spineless in politics, a prey to emotion and passing moods.

The legal press in Russia is acquiring exceptional,
importance, and therefore the question of the correct line, too,
becomes still more and more important, because it is easier
for the enemy to “bombard” us in this field.
 

The best thing would be, probably, if Belenin could have
a “base” in Spain and receive our letters and manuscripts
there: we could continue our discussion, exchange letters,
Belenin could return there soon after his short trip further on
(for the danger is very great, and it would be much more
useful for our cause if Belenin made brief trips round a few
cities and then returned to Spain, or to where he is now,
or to a neighbouring country to consolidate contacts, etc.).

On the second point. The main thing now, I think, is to
publish popular leaflets and manifestos against tsarism.
Consider whether this could be organised in Spain? If not,
we shall prepare them here and send them on. For this the
most efficient transport contacts are essential. You were
quite right: the Japanese have proved absolutely useless.
Best of all would be foreigners, with whom we could
correspond in English or some other foreign language. I will not
dwell on the question of transport, because you yourself
realise and know this. The trouble is that there is no money,
but they should collect some in Petersburg.

The main Party question in Russia has been and remains
the question of “unity”. Trotsky in the 500 or 600 issues of
his paper has not managed to speak out, or to think out,
fully whether there is to be unity with Chkheidze,
Skobelev and Co., or not. I think there are still some “unifiers”
in Petersburg as well, though very weak (was it not they who
published Rabochiye Vedomosti in
Petersburg?).[7] “Makar”,
they say, is in Moscow and also playing the conciliator.
Conciliationism and unificationism is the most harmful
thing for the workers’ party in Russia—not just idiocy,
but the destruction of the Party. For in practice “
unification” (or conciliation and the like) with Chkheidze and
Skobelev (they are the key point, because they give themselves
out to be “internationalists”) is “unity” with the O.C., and
through it with Potresov and Co., i.e., in practice it is 
playing the lackey to the social-chauvinists. If Trotsky and Co.
have not understood this, so much the worse for them.
Dyelo No. 1 and—especially—the participation of the
workers in the war industries committees, prove that this is so.

Not only in elections to the Duma the day after peace
is signed, but in general on all questions of Party practice,
“unity” with Chkheidze and Co. is the essential question
    

today. We can rely only on those who have understood just
how deceptive the idea of unity is and how necessary it is
to break with that fraternity (Chkheidze and Co.) in Russia.
Belenin ought to rally only such people as leaders.

By the way, a split on the international scale is also due.
I consider it quite timely now that all class-conscious
leading workers in Russia should understand this, and should
adopt resolutions in favour of an organisational break with
the Second International, with the International Bureau of
Huysmans, Vandervelde and Co., in favour of building a
Third International only against the Kautskians of all
countries (Chkheidze and Co., also Martov and Axelrod =
the Russian Kautskians). only in rapprochement with
people who lake the stand of the Zimmerwald Left.

On the third point. The most pressing question now is
the weakness of contacts between us and leading workers in
Russia!! No correspondence!! No one but James, and now
he has gone!! We can’t go on like that. We cannot organise
either the publication of leaflets or transport, either
agreement about manifestos or sending over their drafts, etc.,
etc., without regular secret correspondence. That is the key
question!

This Belenin did not do on his first visit (probably he
couldn’t at the time). Convince him, for Christ’s sake,
that this must be done on the second visit! It must be done!!
The immediate success of the visit, really and truly, must
be measured by the number of contacts!! (Of course the
personal influence of Belenin is still more important, but ho
will not be able to stop anywhere for long without
destroying himself and harming the cause.) The number of contacts
in each city will be the measure of the success of his visit!!

Two-thirds of the contacts, as a minimum, in each city,
should be with leading workers, i.e., they should write
themselves, themselves master secret correspondence (artists
are made, not born), should themselves each train up 1–2
“heirs” in case of arrest. This should not be entrusted to
the intelligentsia alone. Certainly not. It can and must be
done by the loading workers. Without this it is impossible
to establish continuity and purpose in our work—and that
is the main thing.

That’s all, I think.
 

As regards legal literature, I will also add: 

it is important to ascertain whether they will accept my
articles in Letopis (if the O.C.–ists cannot be thrown out
by moans of a bloc with the Machists). With restrictions?
Which?

We must find out in greater detail about
Volna.[8]

As regards myself personally, I will say that I need to
earn. Otherwise we shall simply die of hunger, really and
truly!! The cost of living is devilishly high, and there is
nothing to live on. The cash must be dragged by
force[2]

out
of the publisher of Letopis, to whom my two
pamphlets[3]

have been sent (let him pay at once and as much as possible!).
The same with Bonch. The same as regards translations. If
this is not organised I really will not be able to hold out,
this is absolutely serious, absolutely, absolutely.

I shake you firmly by the hand and send a thousand best
wishes to Belenin. Drop me a line that you have received
this immediately, just two words.

Yours,
Lenin

P.S. Write frankly, in what state of mind Bukharin is
leaving? Will he write to us or not? Will he carry out our
requests or not? Correspondence (with America) is possible
only through Norway. Tell him this and arrange it.

October 25, 1916

Dear Friend,

We regret very much that you haven’t written a single
line to us so far. One must hope that the big events in Vienna
will stimulate you at long last to write to us in detail.

Berner Tagwacht (and then other papers) printed a report
that at a war factory in Speyer (Austria) there was a strike
of 24,000 workers, that Czech soldiers opened fire, and that
700 (seven hundred!) workers were killed! How much truth
is there in this? Please let us know about it in as much
detail as you can.

As regards the act of Friedrich
Adler,[3] I would beg
you to let us know the details.

The papers here (Berner Tagwacht and Volksrecht—do
you get them both, or neither?) extol this act. Avanti!
(does Avanti! reach you?) states that Friedrich Adler was
the author of the famous manifesto of the Austrian
internationalists. Is that true? And is it now convenient to speak
about this openly?

(1) Did Friedrich Adler tell anyone about his plan?
(2) Did he give any friend any documents, letters, statements
to be published later?
(3) Is it true, as the Vienna Arbeiter
Zeitung writes, that everywhere (both in the railway club
and in other places) be was in a minority (and how big
was that minority?),
(4)——that his position in the
organisation had become “unbearable” (?)—(5)—that at the last
party conference he received only seven votes?—(6) that
at the last two meetings of trusted agents he attacked the

    

party extremely sharply and demanded “demonstrations”?
(What kind precisely?)

Please write us in as much detail as possible about all
these questions, and in general give us more information
and details about Friedrich Adler. Unless you give us
special instructions to (he contrary, we shall print in our
papers everything that we get from you (and will also
publish them—as material from our editorial office—in the
local German-language press).

As regards the political assessment of the act, we
maintain, of course, our old conviction, confirmed by decades
of experience, that individual terrorist acts are inexpedient
methods of political struggle.

“Killing is no
murder,”[1]

wrote our old Iskra about
terrorist acts; we are not at all opposed to political killing
(in this sense the servile writings of the opportunists in
Vorwärts and the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung are simply
revolting), but as revolutionary tactics individual attacks are
inexpedient and harmful. Only the mass movement can be
considered genuine political struggle. Only in direct,
immediate connection with the mass movement can and must
individual terrorist acts be of value. In Russia the terrorists
(against whom we always struggled) carried out a number
of individual attacks; but in December 1905, when matters
at last reached the stage of a mass movement, insurrection—
when it was necessary to help the masses to use violence—
then just at that moment the “terrorists” were missing.
That is where the terrorists make their mistake.

Adler would have been of much greater help to the
revolutionary movement if, without being afraid of a split,
he had systematically gone over to illegal propaganda
and agitation. It would be very good if some Left group
were found to publish a leaflet in Vienna which would
inform the workers of its view; if it branded in the sharpest
possible way the servile behaviour of the Vienna Arbeiter
Zeitung and Vorwärts, morally justified Adler’s act (“
killing is no murder”), but as a lesson for the workers declared:
not terrorism but systematic, prolonged, self-sacrificing
activity in revolutionary propaganda and agitation,

    

demonstrations, etc., etc., against the lackey-like opportunist
party, against, the imperialists, against one’s own
governments, against the war that is what is needed.

Tell us also, please, how right it would be to regard
Adler’s act as a gesture of despair? I think that politically
it is so. He had lost his faith in the party, he could not
bear the fact that it was impossible to work with this party,
that it was impossible to work with Victor Adler, he could
not accept the idea of a split and take upon himself the
burdensome task of a struggle against the party. And as
a result of his despair came this attempt.

An act of despair of a Kautskian (Volksrecht writes that
Adler was not a supporter of the Zimmerwald Left, but
rather a Kautskian).

But we revolutionaries cannot fall into despair. We
are not afraid of a split. On the contrary, we recognise
the necessity of a split, we explain to the masses why a
split is inevitable and necessary, we call for work against
the old party and for revolutionary mass struggle.

What trends (resp. what individual shades of opinion)
exist in Vienna and in Austria in assessing Adler’s act?
I am afraid that the Vienna Government will declare
Friedrich Adler insane, and not let matters come to a trial.
But if they do, it will certainly be essential to organise
the distribution of leaflets.

Write more and in greater detail, and observe exactly
all technical precautions.

Best greetings!

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear Comrade,

Thank you very much for your story of the Geneva
arguments.[2] It is very important for us to have reactions
from our readers. It’s a pity that we rarely get to know
them.

Lunacharsky, Bezrabotny and Co. are people without
heads.

I advise you to put the question to them squarely: let
them produce written theses (and afterwards in the press),
brief and clear (like our resolutions)—(1) about self–
determination (§ 9 of our Party Programme). Do they agree or
not with the resolution of 1913?

If they don’t, why have they kept silent? Why haven’t
they produced their own?

(2) Why do they reject defence of the fatherland in the
present war?

(3) How do they pose the question of “defence of the
fatherland”?

(4) What is their attitude to national wars, and (5)—to
national insurrections?

Let them reply!

They will muddle themselves up like children, I’ll take
a bet. They haven’t understood anything whatever on the
question of the historical character of the “nation” and of
“defence of the fatherland”.

Since you want to argue with them, I send you my article
from No. 3 (or 4) of Sbornik on this
subject.[3] This is
private, i.e., only for you: after reading it, return it to me

    

or give it to the Karpinskys, to return to me with their
packet. I cannot as yet show it to everyone.

I thought that you had left, and therefore sent my letter
about Swiss affairs only to Noah. But the letter is 
intended for you too.
Read it. Noah does not send a word in reply.
Strange! Very strange!

Best greetings. Get better!

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

You question my remark as to the possibility of
transforming the present imperialist war, too, into a national
war.

Your argument? “We shall have to defend an imperialist
fatherland”....

Is that logical? If the fatherland remains “imperialist”,
how can the war then be national??

The talk about “possibilities”, in my opinion, has been
theoretically wrongly introduced by Radek, and by § 5
of the theses of the
Internationale.[5]

Marxism takes its stand on the facts, and not on
possibilities.

A Marxist must, as the foundation of his policy, put
only precisely and unquestionably demonstrated facts.

That is what our (Party) resolution
does.[1]


When instead of it we are presented with “
impossibility”, I reply: untrue, un-Marxist, a cliché. All kinds of
(transformation are possible.

And I quote a historical fact (the wars of 1792–1815).
I take this example to illustrate the possibility of
something like that nowadays (if there is a development 
backwards).

In my opinion, you are confusing the possible (about
which it was not I who began talking!!) with the real,
when you think that the recognition of a possibility allows
us to alter our tactics. That is the height of illogicality.
 

I recognise the possibility that a Social-Democrat may
be transformed into a bourgeois, and the reverse.

An indubitable truth. Does it follow from this that I
will now recognise a particular bourgeois, Plekhanov, as
a Social-Democrat? No, it does not follow. But what about
the possibility? Let’s wait for it to be transformed into
reality.

That’s all. It is precisely in “methodology” (about which
you write) that one must distinguish the possible from
the real.

All kinds of transformation are possible, even of a Tool
into a wise man, but such a transformation rarely becomes
actual. And merely because of the “possibility” of such
a transformation I shall not cease to consider the fool to
be a fool.

Your perplexities about “dualistic” training are not clear
to me. For I concretely gave the example (Norway) both in
Prosveshcheniye[2]

and in my article against
Kievsky.[3]


You don’t reply to that!! You choose the quite unclear
example of Poland.

This is not “dualistic” training, but reducing different
things to a common denominator, bringing Nizhni and
Smolensk to a common Moscow.

A Swedish Social-Democrat who does not stand for the
freedom of secession for Norway is a scoundrel. This you
do not challenge. A Norwegian Social-Democrat may be
either for secession or against it.
Is unity on such a question
obligatory for all Social-Democrats of all countries? No.
That would be a cliché, a ridiculous cliché, a ridiculous
pretension.

We never blamed the Polish Social-Democrats (I wrote
this in Prosveshcheniye) because they were against the
independence of Poland.

Instead of a simple, clear, theoretically unchallengeable
argument: we cannot now be for the kind of democratic

    

demand (for an independent Poland) that in practice subordinates
us completely to one of the imperialist powers or coalitions 

(this is unquestionable, this is enough; it is essential and
sufficient) 

—instead of this they talked themselves into an absurdity: “It is
unrealisable.”  

We laughed this out of court in 1903 and in April 1916.  

The good Polish Social-Democrats almost, almost proved the
unrealisability of a new Polish state, only ... only the imperialist
Hindenburg interfered: he went and realised
it.[6] 
   

To what ridiculous pedantry people descend when they desire (from the
Cracow point of
view[7]) to make more profound (or more foolish?) the “economic”
aspect!!  

The P.S.D. have got themselves into the position of repudiating
       “Staatenbau”[4]

!!

But is not all democracy Staatenbau? And the independence for the
Dutch Indies which Gorter demands, is not that the
Staatenbau?  

We are for freedom of secession for the Dutch Indies. But is a
Social-Democrat of the Dutch Indies bound to be for secession?
There is another example for you of what you call “dualistic” training!!

   

War is the continuation of politics. Belgium is a colonialist country,
you argue. Nevertheless, shall we really be unable to determine
which politics the present war continues, the politics of
Belgian slave-owning or of Belgian liberation??  

I think we shall be able to.  

And if anyone loses his way, that will be a question of fact.


One cannot, after all, “prohibit” national wars (as Radek wants) out
of fear that brainless people or swindlers again pretend that the
imperialist war is a national one!! That is ridiculous, yet that is the
conclusion from what Radek is saying.  
 

We are not against a national insurrection, we are
for it. That is clear. And we cannot go further than that: we
shall consider each case concretely, and I don’t think we shall take the
rebellion of the South in the United States in 1863 as a “national
insurrection”....  
   

I had Engels’s article from the Grünberg
Archives,[8] but sent it away to Grigory. I shall get it back from him
and send it to you.  

Very best greetings, 

Yours, Lenin 

N. K. asks me very much to send her greetings too.

Dear Friend, 

Of course, I also want to correspond. Let’s continue our
correspondence.  

How I laughed over your postcard, I really had to hold my sides, as
they say. “In France there is no such measure as the ha, but there is the
acre, and you don’t know how big an acre is....”  

That really is funny!  

It was France—imaginez-vous?—that introduced the
metric system. According to the metric system, adopted in most countries of
the world, a ha=hectare=100 acres. An acre is not a French measure
but an English one, about 4/10 of a hectare.  

You mustn’t be offended over my laughing. I didn’t mean any harm. After
all, is it so surprising that you do not often come across the words
hectare, ha, etc.? They are dull, technical words.  

Many thanks for translating the
theses.[4] I will send them to Abramovich and Guilbeaux.  

Alter them for France? It’s hardly worth the while, much is different
there.  

Today there was a meeting of the Lefts here: not everyone
came, only 2 Swiss + 2 foreigners (Germans) + 3 Russ. Jew.
Polish[1]

... Schwach! I think it will be almost a failure:
the second meeting will be in ten days’ time.... It’s difficult for them,
because what it actually amounts to is a war

    

with Grimm, and their forces are too small. Well, we’ll see.  

As regards women, I agree with your addendum.  

You are being captious about the thesis that Social-Democrats
(1) in Switzerland
(2) now should not vote in any circumstances for war credits. After all,
the beginning goes on all the time about the present,
imperialist war. Nothing else but that.  

“The working men have no country”—this means that
(α) his economic position
(le salariat[2]

)

is not national but international,
(β) his class enemy is international,
(γ) the conditions of his emancipation also,
(δ) the international unity of the workers is more
important than the national.  

Does this mean, does it follow from this, that we should not
light when it is a question of throwing off a foreign yoke??  Yes
or no?  

A war of colonies for emancipation?  

—of Ireland against England?  

And an insurrection (national), is not that defence of the fatherland?


I will send you my article against Kievsky about
this.[3]


If you need more books, write. One can get a lot here, and all
the same I am often in the libraries.  

All the best.

Dear Friend, 

As regards rewording for the French, I would not under take
 it.[1]

Perhaps you will try?  

They were written for the Swiss: the “military part” here is a
special one (for a small state), the inner-party situation is different,
etc., etc. Besides, I would not be able to find concrete material
about France.  

I should be heartily glad to do something for the French Left, but
somehow contacts don’t get established. Grisha writes long but
exceptionally meaningless letters, full of water, chews old stuff, nothing
business-like, tells us nothing precise about the French Left, and
establishes no, absolutely no contact with them.  

As regards the fatherland, you evidently want to establish a
contradiction between my writings previously (when? 1913? where precisely?
what precisely?)  and now. I don’t think there are any contradictions. Find
the exact texts, then we shall look at it again.  

Of course, there were always differences between the orthodox and the
opportunists as to the conception of fatherland (cf. Plekhanov 1907 or
1910, Kautsky 1905 and 1907, and Jaurès: L’armée
nouvelle). I entirely agree with this: here the divergence was a
radical one. I don’t think I have ever said anything against that.  
 

That the defence of the fatherland is admissible (when it is
admissible) only as the defence of democracy (in the appropriate epoch), is
my opinion too.  

Of course, proletarians should never “merge” with the general
democratic movement. Marx and Engels did not “merge” with the
bourgeois-democratic movement in Germany in 1848. We Bolsheviks did not
“merge” with the bourgeois-democratic movement in 1905.  

We Social-Democrats always stand for democracy, not “in the name of
capitalism”, but in the name of clearing the path for our
movement, which clearing is impossible without the development of
capitalism.  

Best greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin 

P.S. If you need books, write.

Dear Friend 

As regards “defence of the fatherland” I don’t know whether we differ
or not. You find a contradiction between my article in the collection of
articles To the Memory of
      Marx[1]

and my present statements, without quoting either precisely. I
cannot reply to this. I haven’t got the collection To the Memory of
Marx. Of course, I cannot remember word for word what I wrote in
it. Without precise quotations, then and now, I am not able to
reply to such an argument on your part.  

But generally speaking, it seems to me that you argue somehow
in a somewhat one-sided and formalist manner. You have taken one
quotation from the Communist Manifesto (the working men have no
country) and you seem to want to apply it without any reservations, up
to and including the repudiation of national wars.  

The whole spirit of Marxism, its whole system, demands that each
proposition should be considered
(α) only historically,
(β) only in connection with others,
(γ) only in connection with the concrete experience of
history.  

The fatherland is an historical concept. The fatherland in an epoch or,
more precisely, at the moment of struggle for the overthrow of
national oppression, is one thing. At the moment when national movements
have been left far behind, it is another thing. For the “three types of
countries” (§ 6 of our theses on
 self-determination[2]

)

there cannot
    

be a proposition about the fatherland, and its defence,
identically applicable in all conditions.  

In the Communist Manifesto it is said that the working men
have no country.  

Correct. But not only this is stated there. It is stated there
also that when national states are being formed the role of the proletariat
is somewhat special. To take the first proposition (the working men have no
country) and forget its connection with the second (the
workers are constituted as a class nationally, though not in the same sense
as the bourgeoisie) will be exceptionally incorrect.  

Where, then, does the connection lie? In my opinion, precisely in the
fact that in the democratic movement (at such a moment, in such
concrete circumstances) the proletariat cannot refuse to support it (and,
consequently, support defence of the fatherland in a national war).  

Marx and Engels said in the Communist Manifesto that the
working men have no country. But the same Marx called for a
national war more than once: Marx in 1848, Engels in 1859
(the end of his pamphlet Po and Rhine, where the national
feeling of the Germans is directly in flamed, where they are directly
called upon to wage a national war). Engels in 1891, in
view of the then threatening and advancing war of France (Boulanger)
+Alexander III against Germany, directly recognised “defence of
the
fatherland”.[8] 

Were Marx and Engels muddlers who said one thing today and another
thing tomorrow? No. In my view, admission of “defence of the fatherland”
in a national war fully answers the requirements of Marxism. In
1891 the German Social-Democrats really should have
defended their fatherland in a war against Boulanger + Alexander III. This
would have been a peculiar variety of national war.  

Incidentally, in saying this, I am repeating what I said in my
article against
Yuri.[3]

For some reason you don’t mention it. It seems to me that on the question
raised here there are precisely in that article a number of
propositions which make clear completely (or nearly so) my understanding of
Marxism.  
 

As to Radek—my “quarrel” (???!!!) with Radek. I had an argument
last spring with Grigory, who had no under standing at all of the political
situation at that time, and reproached me for breaking with the Zimmerwald
Left. That is nonsense.  

The connection with the Zimmerwald Left is also a conditional
thing. First of all, Radek is not the Zimmerwald Left. Secondly, there was
no “break” with Radek in general, but only in a particular
sphere. Thirdly, it is stupid to conceive of the connection with
Radek in such a way that our hands should be tied in the
necessary theoretical and practical struggle.  

Ad 1 (to point 1). I never, anywhere, took a single step, not a
suspicion of it, not merely towards a break, but even towards weakening the
ties with the “Zimmerwald Left”. Nobody has ever pointed one out to me,
or will be able to point it out. Neither with Borchardt, nor with the
Swedes, nor with Knief, etc., etc.  

(Radek very meanly threw us out of the editorial board of
Vorbote. Radek behaves in politics like a Tyszka huckster,
impudent, insolent, stupid. Grigory wrote to me in the spring of
1916, when I was already in Zurich, that he had no “team
work” with Radek. Radek has moved away— that is the
fact. He moved away on account of Vorbote, both from me
and from Grigory. On account of the impudence and huckster-like
meanness of one person, the Zimmerwald Left does not cease to be Left, and
there is no purpose in dragging it into the affair: it’s not
sensible, not correct.  

Gazeta Robotnicza, in the number for February 1916, is a
pattern of such a Tyszka-like rotten servile “game” (Radek follows in his
footsteps). Anyone who forgives such things in politics I consider
a donkey or a scoundrel. I shall never forgive them. For such
things you punch men’s faces or turn away.  

Of course I did the second. And I don’t repent. We did not lose a
single hair of our ties with the Left Germans. When the
problem arose of marching together with Radek in practice (the
Zurich Congress of November 4–5,
1916[9]), we went ahead together. All Grigory’s silly phrases
about my break with the Zimmerwald Left proved to be a stupidity, which
they always were.)  
 

Ad 2—the “sphere” of the break with Radek, therefore, were
(α) Russian and Polish affairs. The resolution of the
Committee of Organisations Abroad confirmed this.
(β) The affair with Yuri and Co. Radek even now is writing (I
can send you them if you wish) the most impudent letters to me (and
Grigory) on the theme that, “we” (he + Bukharin + Yuri and Co.) “see
things” in such-and-such a way!! Only a donkey and a scoundrel, who wants
to invent an “intrigue”, squeezing through the crack of
differences between us and Yuri and Co., can write in this way. If Radek
did not understand what he was doing, then he is a
donkey. If he did understand, then he is a scoundrel.  

The political task of our Party was clear: we could not tie
our hands by equality in the editorial board with N. I. + Yuri +
E. B. (Grigory did not understand this, and drove me to a direct ultimatum:
I declared that I would resign from Kommunist if we did
not break with it. Kommunist was a good thing, so long as
there was no separate programme of the trio who composed 1/2 the
editorial board). To grant equality to a group consisting of
Bukharin + Yuri + E. B. would be idiocy and the ruin of all the
work. Neither Yuri, quite a little pig, nor E. B. has a drop of brains, and
if they had allowed themselves to descend to group stupidity with
Bukharin, then we had to break with them, more precisely with
Kommunist. And that was done.  

The polemics over self-determination are only beginning as yet. Here
they are in complete confusion—as in the whole question about
the attitude to democracy. To grant “equality” to little pigs and
fools—never!  They didn’t want to learn peaceably and in comradely
fashion, so let them blame themselves. (I pestered them, provoking
conversations about it in Berne: they turned up their noses! I wrote them
letters, tens of pages long, to Stockholm—they turned up their noses!
Well, if that’s how it is, let them go to the devil. I did everything
possible for a peaceable out come. If you don’t want it, I will
punch your faces and expose you as idiots before the whole world. That, and
only that, is the way to treat them.)  But where does Radek come in, you
may ask.  

Because lie was the “heavy artillery” of this “group”, artillery
hidden in the bushes on one side. Yuri and Co.

    

were quite skilful in their calculations (E. B. is capable as an intriguer,
it turned out that she was not leading Yuri to us, but setting up
a group against us). Their calculation was: we shall start the war, but
it’s Radek who will fight for us!! Radek will fight for us, while
Lenin will have his hands tied.  

But it didn’t come off, my dear little pigs! I will not let my hands be
tied in politics. If you want to fight, come out openly. But the role of
Radek—secretly inciting young pigs, but himself hiding behind the
“Zimmerwald Left”—is the height of scoundrelism. The most lousy ... of
the Tyszka swamp could not have been playing the huckster, the lackey and
the intriguer behind one’s back in dirtier fashion.  

Ad 3—I have already stated clearly. The question of the relationship
of imperialism to democracy and the minimum programme is arising on an
ever wider scale (see the Dutch programme in No. 3 of the
Bulletin[10] the American S.L.P. have thrown out the
whole minimum programme.
      Entwaffnungsfrage[4]

).

On this Radek has absolute confusion in his head (this is clear
from his theses; it was also shown by the question of indirect and direct
taxes raised in my theses). I will never let my hands be tied in explaining
this most important and fundamental question. I cannot. The question has to
be cleared up. There will be dozens of “falls” over it yet (they
will stumble for certain).  

Anyone who understands the “connection” with the Zimmerwald Left in
such a way that we should let our hands be tied in the theoretical
struggle against “imperialist Economism” (that international
disease; Dutch-American-Russian, etc.), understands nothing. To learn by
heart the words “Zimmerwald Left” and to kowtow before the utter
theoretical confusion in Radek’s head, that I don’t accept.  

The results: after Zimmerwald manoeuvres were more
difficult. It was necessary to take the essential from Radek,
E. B. and Co., without allowing one’s hands to be tied. I
consider that I was successful in this. After Bukharin’s departure to
America and, above all, after Yuri had sent us his article and
after he had accepted (he accepted! he had
    

to accept) my reply, their affairs, as a “group”, were
finished. (Yet Grigory wanted to perpetuate that group,
granting it equality: we would give it equality!!)  

With Radek we parted company on the Russo-Polish arena, and
did not invite him into our
Sbornik.[11] It had to be that way.  

And now he can do nothing which could spoil the work. He was
obliged at the Zurich Congress (November 5, 1916) to go together
with me, as now, against Grimm.  

What does this mean? It means that I succeeded in
  dividing[5]

the questions: not in one iota is the internationalist pressure on
the Kautskians (Grimm
 y compris[6]

)

weakened, and at the same time I am not subjected to “equality” with
Radek’s stupidity!  

Strategically I now consider the cause to have been won. It is possible
that Yuri + Co. + Radek + Co. will abuse me. Allez-y,
mes
     amis![7]
Now the odium will fall on you, not on us. But
you will now not injure the cause, and for us the road has been
cleared. We have disentangled our selves from the dirty (in all
senses) muddle with Yuri and Radek, without in one iota weakening
the “Zimmerwald Left”, and possessing the requisites for the
struggle against stupidity on the question of the attitude to democracy.


Voilà. I apologise for this long letter and for the
abundance of sharp words: I can’t write otherwise when I am speaking
frankly. Well, after all, this is all entre nous, and perhaps the
unnecessary bad language will pass.  

Best greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin 

In general, both Radek and Pannekoek are incorrect in the way
they approach the question of the struggle against Kautskianism. This
N.B.!!

Dear Comrade, 

Will you allow me to suggest an amicable agreement?  

I must admit that yesterday I paid insufficient attention to one very
important point in your
arguments.[2] Namely, the idea that the peculiarity of Switzerland
lies, among other things, in her greater degree of democracy (the
referendum), and that this peculiarity should be made use of also
for propaganda purposes. This idea is very important and, in my opinion,
completely correct.  

Could we not apply this idea in such a way that our differences (which
are probably very insignificant) should disappear? For example: 

If we put the question for the referendum only in this
way—for complete elimination or against?—we shall get a mixture of
pacifist (bourgeois-pacifist, etc.) and socialist votes for it, i.e., we
shall get not a clarification of a socialist consciousness but a darkening
of it, not the application of the idea and the policy of class
struggle to this particular question (namely, the question of
militarism) but the renunciation of the point of view of the class struggle
on the question of militarism.  

But if we put the question for the referendum in this way—for the
expropriation of large capitalist enterprises in industry and agriculture,
as the only way of completely eliminating militarism, or against
expropriation?  
 

If we put it like that, we shall be saying in our practical policy the
same thing that we all recognise theoretically, namely, that the complete
elimination of militarism is thinkable and realisable only in connection
with the elimination of capitalism.  

Consequently there should be approximately the following formulation:
(1) we demand the immediate expropriation of large enterprises,
perhaps in the form of a direct Federal property and income tax, with such
high, revolutionarily-high, rates for large properties that the capitalists
will, in fact, be expropriated.  

(2) We declare that such a socialist transformation of Switzerland is
economically possible already today, directly, and, in consequence of the
unbearably high cost of living, is urgently necessary as well, and that for
the political effecting of such a transformation Switzerland needs not a
bourgeois but a proletarian government, which would rely not on the
bourgeoisie but on the broad masses of hired workers and small people, and
that the revolutionary mass struggle which we see beginning, for example,
in the mass strikes and street demonstrations in Zurich, and which is
recognised by the Aarau
decision,^^264 pursues exactly that purpose—to put a
real end in that way to the intolerable position of the masses.


(3) We declare that such a transformation of Switzerland will quite
inevitably arouse imitation and the most resolute enthusiastic support
on the part of the working class and the mass of the exploited in
all civilised countries, and that only in connection with
such a transformation will the complete elimination of militarism
for which we strive, and for which at present particularly wide masses in
Europe are instinctively thirsting, become not an empty phrase, not an
amiable wish, but a genuine, practically achievable and politically
self-explanatory measure.  

What do you think of this?  

Do you not consider that, if the question is put in this way (both in
practical agitation and in parliamentary speeches and proposals for a
legislative initiative and for a referendum), we shall avoid the
danger that bourgeois and “socialist” pacifists will falsely understand
and misinterpret

    

our anti-militarist slogan in the sense that we suppose it possible to
completely abolish militarism in bourgeois Switzerland, in her
imperialist environment, without a socialist revolution
(which, of course, is nonsense that we all unanimously repudiate).  

With Party greetings,

 N. Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Another letter has arrived today from St. Petersburg—they have been
attentive in their writing lately.  

Apart from the letter from
Guchkov,[2] which is going into No. 57 of the Central Organ (being
set), and which probably Grigory showed you in Berne, letters from Lvov and
Chelnokov[3] have been received, all on the same subject, the country’s
bitter indignation (against the traitors carrying on negotiations for a
separate peace), etc.  

The mood, they write, is supremely revolutionary.  

My manuscript about imperialism has reached Petersburg, and now they
write today that the publisher (and this is Gorky! oh the calf!) is
dissatisfied with the sharp passages against ... who do you
think? ... Kautsky! He wants to get in touch with me about it!!! Both
laughable and disappointing.  

There it is, my fate. One fighting campaign after another—against
political stupidities, philistinism, opportunism and so forth.  

It has been going on since 1893. And so has the hatred of the
philistines on account of it. But still, I would not exchange this fate for
“peace” with the philistines.  

Now there is Radek as well. No. 6 of Jugend-Internationale
(have you seen it?) contains the article by Nota Bene. We (Grigory and I)
at once recognised Bukharin. I replied to his exceptional stupidities in
No. 2 of
  Sbornik.[1]

(You haven’t seen it? It was ready a few days ago.)  
 

Today Grigory sends me No. 25 of Arbeiterpolitik. There is the
same article in it (with cuts, obviously made by the censors),
signed by Bukharin. (We have received one more number of, Novy
Mir, from New York, containing a criticism—alas, alas! A correct
one: that is the tragedy, that a Menshevik is right against
Bukharin!!—a criticism evidently of the same article (in a
number which we haven’t got) by Bukharin in Novy Mir.)  

And Radek—“Tyszka’s methods”, Grigory writes to me
today—publishes in No. 25 of Arbeiterpolitik praise of Bukharin
(“a young force”) and a little note, in passing, about the “three
editors of Kommunist”!  

He squeezes into the crack of the differences between us: the
time-honoured policy of riffraff and scoundrels, incapable of arguing with
us straightforwardly and resorting to intrigues, double-dealing,
baseness.  

There is a picture for you of what is, and of what
Radek does (a man is judged not by what he says or thinks about
himself, but by what he does—do you remember that Marxist truth?).  

Voilà.  

This is the kind of “environment” one has to fight with!!


And what theoretical disgrace and nonsense in Radek’s “theses”....


I have been reading the Plaidoirie[4] by Humbert-Droz. My
God, what a philistine of Tolstoyism!! I have written again to
Abramovich. Is he really hopeless after all? I am wondering whether there
are not in Switzerland bacilli of petty-bourgeois (and petty-state)
thick-wittedness, Tolstoyism, and pacifism, which destroy the best people?
I am sure there must be!  

I have read the second pamphlet by P. Golay
(L’Anti-militarisme)—what a gigantic step back in comparison
with the first (Le Socialisme qui meurt), and into the
same swamp....  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

P.S. Do you ski? You really should! Learn the trick, get yourself skis
and go off to the mountains—you must. It’s good in the mountains in
winter!  It’s delightful, and smells of Russia.

December 21, 1916 

Dear M.N., 

I have received your postcard, of December 14, 1916. If they write to
you that the publisher owes me “in addition to the 500 rubles another 300
rubles”, I must say that I consider he owes me more, because he
accepted
(1) my work on the agrarian question,
Part 1[1]

and
(2) my wife’s booklet on an educational
subject.[2] And I consider that there is an obligation to pay for what
has been accepted, once the manuscript has been delivered.  

I wrote about this to Petersburg, but my contacts with Petersburg are
exceptionally weak and intolerably slow.  

You “thought it possible” to throw out the criticism of Kautsky in my
pamphlet[3].... Sad! Really, really sad. Why? Would it not be better to
ask the publishers: print outright, gentlemen, that we—the
publishers—have eliminated criticism of a Kautsky. Really, that is how it
should have been done.... Of course, I am obliged to submit to the
publisher, but let the publisher not be afraid to say what he wants and
what he doesn’t want; let the publisher answer for the cuts, not I.  

You write: “You won’t thrash me, will you?”, i.e., for agreeing to
throw out this criticism?? Alas, alas, we live in too civilised an age to
settle questions so simply....  
 

Joking aside, it is sad, devil take it.... Well, I shall settle
accounts with Kautsky in another place.  

I shake your hand and send my best greetings.

Dear Friend, 

About Radek. You write: “I told him at Kienthal that he had behaved
badly.”  

Is that all? Only that! What about the political conclusion?? Or was
his action only an accident?? Only his personal affair?? Nothing of the
kind! There is the source of your political mistake. You do not assess what
is going on politically. Yet really this is a question of politics, however
strange it might seem at first sight.  

As regards defence of the fatherland. It would be most unpleasant for
me if we differed on this. Let us try once more to come to agreement.  

Here is some “material for reflection”: 

War is the continuation of politics.  

Everything depends on the system of political relations before
the war and during the war.  

The main types of these systems are
(a) the relation of the oppressed nation to the oppressing,
(b) the relation between two oppressing nations on account of the loot, its
division, etc.,
(c) the relation of a national state which does not oppress others to one
which oppresses, to a particularly reactionary state.  

Think over this.  

Caesarism in France + tsarism in Russia against
non-imperialist Germany in 1891—that was the historical
situation in 1891.  

Think over that! And I was writing of 1891 in No. 1 of Sbornik
as
well.[1]

 

How glad I am that you have had a talk with Guilbeaux and Levi! It
would be a good thing to do this more frequently, or at any rate from time
to time. As for the Italian, he is lying! Turati’s speech is a model of
rotten Kautskianism (he has dragged “droits nationaux”
into the imperialist war!!). And the article by bb about this speech in Volksrecht is rotten too.


Oh, how I would like to write about this, or to have a talk with the
Italian!!  

How stupid that Levi is attacking parliamentarism!! Stupid!! And a
“Left”, too!! God, how much muddle there is in people’s heads.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

About Radek you, following Grigory, seem to have got confused between
personal impressions and sadness over the “dark” political picture in
general and politics. You are sorry, you regret, you sigh—and nothing
more. No other policy than that which was followed could have been
pursued. We could not renounce correct views and surrender to “Tyszka’s
methods”. The picture is “dark” not because of this, and the Lefts are
weak not because of this, and Vorbote is not appearing not because
of this—but because the revolutionary movement grows extremely slowly and
with difficulty. This has to be put up with; rotten blocs with a certain
person (or with E. B. + Kii) would only interfere with performing
the difficult task of standing fast in difficult times.  

As regards “imperialist Economism”, it somehow turns out that we are
“talking past each other”. You evade the definition I gave,
pass it by and put the question again.  

The “Economists” did not “renounce” political struggle (as you
write)—that is inaccurate. They defined it wrongly. The
“imperialist Economists” do the same.  

You write: “Would even the complete rejection of democratic demands
mean rejecting the political struggle? Is not the direct struggle
for the conquest of power political struggle?”  

The whole point is that with Bukharin (and partly with Radek as well)
this is just the kind of thing you get and it is wrong. “The direct
struggle for the conpuest
    

of power” while “completely rejecting democratic demands” is something
unclear, unthought-out, confused. This is just what Bukharin is confused
about.  

More precisely, you approach the question from rather a different point
of view, when you see a contradiction between §§ 2 and 8.  

In § 2 there is a general statement: the socialist
revolution is impossible without the struggle for democracy. This
is unquestionable, and this is just the weakness of Radek + Bukharin that
they, while disagreeing (like you), don’t venture to challenge
it!!  

But further, in a certain sense for a certain period, all
democratic aims (not only self-determination! Note that! You have forgotten
that!) are capable of hindering the socialist revolution. In what sense? At
what moment?  When? How? For example, if the movement has already
developed, the revolution has already begun, we have to seize
the banks, and we are being appealed to: wait, first
consolidate, legitimise the republic, etc.!  

An example: in August 1905, the boycott of the Duma was correct, and
was not rejection of political struggle.  

((§ 2 in general, refusal to participate in
representative institutions is an absurdity; § 8 there are cases when
we have to refuse; there is a visual comparison for you which
makes clear that there is no contradiction between § 2 and
§ 8.))  

Against Junius. The situation is the imperialist war. The remedy for
it? Only a socialist revolution in Germany. Junius did not draw this
conclusion, and took democracy without the socialist revolution.


One should know how to combine the struggle for democracy and
the struggle for the socialist revolution, subordinating the first
to the second. In this lies the whole difficulty; in this is the whole
essence.  

The Tolstoyans and the anarchists throw out the first. Bukharin and
Radek have become confused, failing to combine the first with the second.


But I say: don’t lose sight of the main thing (the socialist
revolution); put it first (Junius has not done this); put all the
democratic demands, but subordinating them to it, co-ordinating them with
it (Radek + Bukharin unwisely

    

eliminate one of them), and bear in mind that the struggle for the
main thing may blaze up even though it has begun with the struggle for
something partial. In my opinion, only this conception of the matter is the
right one.  

A war of France + Russia against Germany in 1891. You take “my
criterion”, and apply it only to France and Russia!!!! For pity’s
sake, where is the logic here? That’s just what I say, that on the part
of France and Russia it would have been a reactionary war (a war in
order to turn back the development of Germany, to return her from national
unity to dismemberment). But on the part of Germany? You are
silent. Yet that is the chief thing. For Germany in 1891, the war did not,
and could not, have an imperialist character.  

You have forgotten the main thing—that in 1891 no imperialism existed
at all (I have tried to show in my pamphlet that it was born in 1898–1900,
not earlier), and there was no imperialist war, there could not be, on the
part of Germany. (By the way, there was no revolutionary Russia then
either; that is very important.)  

Furthermore, you write: “The ‘possibility’ of the dismemberment of
Germany is not excluded in the 1914–17 war either”, simply sliding away
from the assessment of what exists to what is possible.  

That is not historical. It is not political.  

What exists today is an imperialist war on
both sides. This we have said 1,000 times. This is the essence.


And the “possible”!!?? All kinds of things are “possible”!  

It is ridiculous to deny the “possibility” of transforming
the imperialist war into a national war (though Usiyevich was horrified at
the idea!). What is not “possible” on this earth! But so far it
has not been transformed. Marxism buttresses its policy on the
actual, not on the “possible”. It is possible that one
phenomenon will change into an other—and our tactics are not
fossilised. Parlez-moi de la réalité et non pas des
      possibilités![1]


Engels was right. In my day I have seen an awful lot of hasty charges
that Engels was an opportunist, and my

    

attitude to them is supremely distrustful. Try, I say and prove first that
Engels was wrong!! You won’t prove it!  

Engels’s foreword to The Class Struggles in
France[2]? Don’t you know that it was distorted in Berlin
against his will? Is that serious criticism?  

His statement about the Belgian
strike[3]? When? Where? What? I don’t know it.  

No. No. Engels was not infallible. Marx was not
infallible. But if you want to point out their “fallibility” you have to
set about it differently, really, quite differently. Otherwise you are
1,000 times wrong.  

Very, very best greetings.  

Yours, Lenin

1917 

A meeting of the C.C. of the Swiss party was held here on Sunday
(January 7).  

The scoundrel Grimm at the head of all the Rights got carried
(against Nobs, Platten, Münzenberg and Name) a decision to
postpone, for an indefinite period, the party congress which had
been fixed for February 11, 1917 specially on the question of the war. The
reasons were false. In reality it was his desire for a bloc with the
Rights, with the social-patriots, who threatened to resign if defence of
the fatherland were rejected!! They don’t want to allow the Swiss workers
to decide the question of defence of the fatherland!!!  

Name, they say, told Grimm excellently that he was cutting his own
throat as international secretary.  

Chairman of Zimmerwald, etc.—yet such a scoundrel in politics!  

I have a mind to write an open letter to Charles
Naine,[1]

a member of the International Socialist Commission, to publish it, to call
Grimm a blackguard in it, and to say that I don’t want to be in the
Zimmerwald organisation with such a type, and am sending a reasoned
statement on this to my Central Committee.  

It’s important to “catch” Grimm immediately, en flagrant
    délit[2]

—to

expose him (since “they” will not let anything get into the press), to
tear off his mask.  
 

I think this will make Radek + Roland-Holst also say something
to Grimm.  

Of course, such a leaflet is not suitable for publishing under
our imprint, it must be published separately, outside our firm.  

Very, very best greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin

Dear Friend, 

About Engels. If you have run across the issue of Neue Zeit
with Kautsky’s story (and Engels’s letters) about how they distorted
Engels’s preface to Klassenkämpfe, it would be a good thing if
you copied it out in full detail in a special notebook. If you can’t, then
send me the exact number of Neue Zeit, the year, volume and
page.[2] 

Your attacks on Engels, I am convinced, are totally groundless. Excuse
my frankness. One must prepare much more seriously before writing like
that!  Otherwise it’s easy to disgrace oneself—I warn you entre
nous, as a friend, between ourselves, in case you begin talking in
this way some day in the press or at a meeting.  

The Belgian strike? First of all it is possible that on this question
of fact, an individual question, Engels was mistaken. Of course, that is
possible. One must collect every thing he wrote on this question. Secondly,
events in recent times in general, 1905 definitely, have
provided something new about general strikes, which Engels did not
know. Engels had been accustomed for decades to hear about the “general
strike” only the empty phrases of the anarchists, whom he
legitimately hated and despised. But later events have
demonstrated a new type of “mass strike”, a
political one, i.e., a particularly non-anarchist one. This new
feature Engels did not know yet, and could not know.  

This must not be forgotten.  

Was not the Belgian strike a transition from the old to the
new? Could Engels at that time (1891–92?? He was already 71–72;
dying) see that this was not the old Belgian

    

belch (the Belgians for a long time were Proudhonists), but the transition
to something new? This must be thought over.  

As regards “defence of the fatherland”, in my opinion, you are
falling into abstraction and unhistoricalness. I repeat what I said in the
article against
 Yuri[1]

:

defence of the fatherland = justification for taking part in the
war. Nothing more. To generalise this, to make it a “general
principle”, is ridiculous, supremely unscientific. (I will send
you the American programme of the S.L.P., with this ridiculous
generalisation.) Wars are a supremely varied, diverse, complex thing. One
cannot approach them with a general pattern.  

(I) Three main types: the relation of an oppressed nation to the
oppressor (every war is the continuation of politics; politics is the
relationship between nations, classes, etc.). As a general rule,
war is legitimate on the part of the oppressed (irrespective of whether it
is defensive or offensive in the military sense).  

(II) The relation. between two oppressor nations. The struggle for
colonies, for markets, etc. (Rome and Carthage; Britain and Germany
1914–17). As a general rule, a war of that kind is robbery on
both sides; and the attitude of democracy (and socialism) to it
comes under the rule: “Two thieves are fighting, may they both
perish”....  

(III) The third type. A system of nations with equal
rights. This question is much more complex!!!! Especially if side
by side with civilised, comparatively democratic nations there stands
tsarism. That’s how it was (approximately) in Europe from 1815 to 1905.


1891. The colonial policy of France and Germany was
insignificant. Italy, Japan, the United States had no
colonies at all (now they have). In Western Europe a
system had come into being (N.B. this!! Think over this!!  Don’t
forget this!! We live not only in separate states, but also in a certain
system of states; it is permissible for the anarchists to ignore
this; we are not anarchists), a system of states, on the whole
constitutional and national. Side by side with them was powerful,
unshaken, pre-revolutionary tsarism, which had plundered and oppressed
everyone for hundreds of years, which crushed the revolutions of 1849 and
1863.  
 

Germany (in 1891) was the country of advanced socialism. And
this country was menaced by tsarism in alliance with Boulangism!  

The situation was quite, quite different from what it is in 1914–17,
when tsarism has been undermined by 1905, while Germany is waging a war to
dominate the world. A different pair of shoes!!  

To identify, even to compare the international situations of 1891 and
1914, is the height of unhistoricalness.  

Stupid Radek wrote recently in the Polish manifesto (“Befreiung
Polens”) that “Staatenbau” is not the aim of the
Social-Democratic struggle. This is arch-stupidity! It is half-anarchism,
half-idiocy! No, no, we are not at all indifferent to the
Staatenbau, to the system of states, to their mutual
relations.  

Engels was the father of “passive radicalism”?? Untrue! Nothing of
the kind. You will never be able to prove this. (Bogdanov and Co. tried,
but only disgraced themselves.)  

In the imperialist war of 1914–17, between two
imperialist coalitions, we must be against “defence of the fatherland”,
since
(1) imperialism is the eve of socialism,
(2) imperialist war is a war of thieves over their booty,
(3) in both coalitions there is an advanced proletariat,
(4) in both a socialist revolution is ripe. Only for
these reasons are we against “defence of the fatherland”, only
for these reasons!!  

Best greetings and wishes.  

Yours,
Lenin 

I have sent for the addresses of the youth organisations. They have
been promised me.  

And so, as regards the plan of publication: push ahead with
the affair. And your lecture on
pacifism?[3] 


P.S. I got both your last two letters at once, but it must have been my own
fault.

Dear Friend, 

Your lecture was yesterday, and I am impatiently waiting for news of
how it went off. When I got your express letter on Thursday, I hurried to
Radek at the other end of the town and collected some cuttings from him. I
wanted very much to write you a long letter on pacifism (an extremely
important subject in general, a basic one from the point of view of the
whole international situation today, about which I wrote in the
       article[1]

--I

have received it, merci!—and lastly a particularly important
subject for Switzerland). But I did not manage it: both on
Thursday and on Friday we had meetings of the Lefts.  

Things have gone badly for the Lefts here, because Nobs and Platten
have become frightened of a war against Grimm, who furiously
attacked the
referendum[2] and frightened our young friends!! Sad!! In Berne,
judging from Grigory’s letters, things are better. Radek, at my insistence,
has written a little pamphlet against the “Centre” here and Grimm, but
yesterday the “Lefts” defeated (!!) the plan that it should be published
by the Lefts: they have been frightened by the fright of Nobs and
Platten. What warriors! What Lefts!  

I think you should consider your lecture last night a
rehearsal, and make ready to repeat it in Geneva and La
Chaux-de-Fonds. It is worth working up this subject, and lecturing on it
more than once. It will do the Swiss

    

a tremendous lot of good. Write in as much detail as possible
how you put the question, what arguments you advanced,
what objections you met, etc.  

Have the draft resolutions for the Swiss Congress on defence of the
fatherland and the question of the war been translated into French? I mean
translation in the press:
Grütlianer, Sentinelle, etc. Or not?  

It would be well to arrange for their translation, if it has not been
done, and to think about agitation and propaganda.  

Probably this question will go ahead in connection with your visit to
Chaux-de-Fonds. I shall await news from you.  

Abramovich is working wonderfully, and he should be supported in every
possible way.  

All possible greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin 

P.S. Trotsky has sent in a silly letter. We shall neither print it nor
reply to him.  


Has any campaign begun in the press of French Switzerland about
(1) the referendum and
(2) the resolutions on the war question for the Congress? Or is there no
campaign? Do you see, and regularly, Volksrecht and Berner
Tagwacht? This is essential now; we have to help the Swiss Lefts.


Did I write to you that Guilbeaux refused to sign the resolution
against Grimm?  (Or maybe you have heard this already from Grigory?) He’s
not up to much, our Guilbeaux; he’s afraid of a war with Grimm, he’s
afraid of Sokolnikov, who is afraid of a split; he’s
afraid of Merrheim, who is afraid of “Monsieur” Jouhaux!! Well, what
warriors!! I want to write about this to Olga.

[1]
Reference is apparently to the article “Bourgeois Pacifism and

[2]
The referendum was on the question of holding an extraordinary congress
of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party to discuss the attitude to be adopted
to militarism and war. The referendum was declared by the Swiss Left
Social-Democrats in connection with the decision of the Executive of the
Swiss Social-Democratic Party to postpone the congress indefinitely.

Dear Friend, 

I send you the cuttings I have taken from Radek (only up to Saturday:
return them (to me) immediately after the lecture).  

Note the paragraph in the resolution of the Internationale
which declares against pacifism (against “persuasion”).  

The conference at The Hague and similar pacifist declarations and
measures undertaken by the governments and the bourgeoisie are produced


(1) by hypocrisy 

(2) by deception of the people 

(3) by the trend of bourgeois pacifism, possessing “big”
names and dreaming of peace without a social revolution. This
trend has a vast literature (aristocratic, not for the people)


(4) by calculation: it is convenient sometimes for one, sometimes for
another power to “show itself” peaceful, to gain time, etc.  

This is in general. Concretely, one must study each particular case,
and each power.  

I haven’t got the figures you ask for.  

(The addresses have been sent: Abramovich and his friends are the best
people to give a recommendation, if required.)  

The key to the question of pacifism (a question most important for
Switzerland): the idea that war is not connected

    

with capitalism, is not the continuation of the politics of
peacetime. In this lies the theoretical falsity; the practical one is
evasion of the social revolution.  

In great haste. Greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I have received the cuttings. Merci!  

We were recently visited by two escaped prisoners of war. It was
interesting to see “live” people, not corroded by emigrant life. As
types: one is a Jew from Bessarabia, who has seen life, a Social-Democrat
or nearly a Social- Democrat, has a brother who is a Bundist, etc. He has
knocked about, but is uninteresting as an individual because
commonplace. The second is a Voronezh peasant, a man of the soil, from an
Old Believers’ family. A breath from the Black Earth. It was extremely
interesting to watch him and listen. He spent a year in a German prison
camp (a mass of horrors) with 27,000 Ukrainians. The Germans build
up camps according to nations, and do their utmost to break them away from
Russia; for the Ukrainians they sent in skilful lecturers from Galicia. The
results? Only 2,000, according to him, were for “self-rule” (independence
in the sense more of autonomy than of separation) after months of effort by
the agitators!! The remainder, he says, were furious at the thought of
separation from Russia and going over to the Germans or Austrians.  

A notable fact! One cannot but believe him. 27,000 is a big number. A
year is ample time. The conditions for the Galician propaganda were
exceptionally favourable. And yet closeness to the Great Russians got the
upper hand! This does not imply, of course, that “freedom of
separation” is in any way wrong. On the contrary. But it follows from

    

this that, maybe, fate will free Russia from the “Austrian type” of
development.  

As regards defence of the fatherland our Voronezh man is like
Troyanovsky and Plekhanov. He sympathises with socialism, but “if the
Germans are pushing on, why shouldn’t we defend ourselves?” He doesn’t
understand. He is deeply hurt (both he and the Jew!!) that the
Germans are so mercilessly beating “our people”. As regards the tsar and
God, all the 27,000, he says, have finished with them completely, as
regards the big landowners too. They will return to Russia embittered and
enlightened.  

All the yearning of the Voronezh man is to get back home, to the land,
to his farm. He traipsed around the German villages working, kept his eyes
open and learned a lot.  

They praise the French (in the prison camps) as good comrades. “The
Germans also curse their Kaiser.” They hate the English: “Swelled heads;
won’t give you a piece of bread if you won’t wash the floor for them”
(that’s the kind of swine you get, perverted by imperialism!).  

To change the subject, what a splendid row has arisen over the
referendum, especially its preamble! Delightful! You should have seen the
articles by Grimm and Co. in Berner Tagwacht and the
“provincial” Social-Democratic press! One continuous howl and groan!
We’ve hit the scoundrels just where it hurt. I did my utmost to incite
Radek (he is still here, and we are maintaining—you didn’t expect
it?—the utmost friendship, as always against the “Centre”,
when there is no ground for Radekite twisting, diplomacy about
“rights”, etc.) to write a little pamphlet: we walked about Zurich for
hours with me “nagging” him. He sat down and wrote it. Our “Lefts”,
frightened by Nobs and Platten (those heroes were frightened by
Grimm, who him self was frightened by Greulich and Co.!!), heard it read
and turned it down (!!): it must not be printed, or they
would be expelled from the Party (!!). We shall print it separately.  

The situation is such that interest has been heightened, and that all
who are internationalists not merely in words must help the Swiss
workers and the Left. And we shall help them!  
 

And yet another subject. I have been rereading Engels’s Zur
Wohnungsfrage[2] with his preface of 1887. Do you know it?
Wonderful! I am still “in love” with Marx and Engels, and cannot calmly
stand any abuse of them. No, these were real people! We must learn from
them. We must not leave that basis. It was from that basis that
both the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians departed. (By the way, have
you seen the Loriot-Rappoport, Saumoneau
resolution?[3] Also 3/4 Kautskian. I want to write something for the
French, to demolish it and pacifism as a whole. I will ask Grisha whether
he will publish it. He did not reply about my answer to
      Souvarine![1]

).

Well, each and every good wish, I’ve chattered three bags full.  

All the best.  

Yours,
Lenin 

P.S. I hope that the referendum will bring much benefit in French
Switzerland as well. I await news from Abramovich, Olga, etc.

Dear Friend, 

I was very glad to have your letter. I like the plan of your
       lecture[1]

very much. I advise you to be sure to repeat it, to challenge H. Droz to
battle, to supplement the lecture with a section on the revolution (only
perhaps the size of the lecture will not permit it?), i.e., how
can the revolution take place, what is the dictatorship of the proletariat,
why is it necessary, why is it impossible without arming the
proletariat, why is it fully compatible with complete, all-round democracy
(in spite of the vulgar opinion)?  

Droz and the other Swiss social-pacifists do not under stand
it; they have not thought it out; and the Swiss conditions
d’un petit État et de la petite bourgeoisie d’un petit
  État[2]
generate in every possible way precisely pbs (=petty bourgeois) pacifism. 

If you receive Volksrecht and Berner Tagwacht (it is
essential to read these two papers), that is, in my opinion,
enough for judging the position of the Centre, which is exactly
the position of Grimm (the scoundrel! How fraudulently he “fights” the
social-patriot Huber-Rohrschach!!), and to which both Nobs and Platten have
(3/4) descended. You are terribly mistaken if you are not joking, when you
write of my “influence” on Platten. This is how matters

    

stand: he and Nobs “put themselves down” as Lefts at Zimmerwald and
Kienthal. I made dozens of attempts to draw them into discussions, a study
circle, talks. All in vain!! They are afraid of Grimm and of a
struggle against him. They are 3/4 in the “Centre”. They are
almost hopeless. Perhaps a strong movement of the Left will
straighten them out, but even that is hardly likely!  

Today we have not yet received the corrected resolution. We hope for it
tomorrow.  

Münzenberg told me yesterday that on Tuesday they are having a
conference of the Young from German- and French-speaking Switzerland. By
that time we must have our resolution on the question of the
war. (Radek undertook to draft one, but so far has not produced
it.) My opinion is that you should set to work as hard as you can, so as
before Tuesday to be able
(1) to write to Geneva and
      Ch.-de-F.[3]

that for the time being they should take my theses (the paragraphs
on the question of the war, section I) as a basis;
(2) to discover who will be at the meeting of the Young from French
Switzerland;
(3) to “work them over”, “instruct” them, so that they understand what
really distinguishes us from
(α) social-pacifism and
(β) the “Centre” (=Grimm and Co.). (Platten has understood
absolutely nothing, and doesn’t want to learn.) Our position, in general,
=Karl Liebknecht, the struggle against social-patriotism and the Centre of
one s own country; the inseparable connection between the struggle
against the war and the struggle against opportunism, and
all-round and immediate revolutionary work for
the socialist revolution.  

The preamble to the referendum, by the way,=the first step to a
platform of the Left in Switzerland. N.B. this.  

On Tuesday the Young from French Switzerland will definitely put
forward a draft Left resolution and fight for it. I have not yet seen the
corrections, but I am sure that he is injuring the cause
(reconciling and muddling the differences between the Left and the Swiss
social patriots, not opening them up. In this lies the whole essence and
the whole foulness of Grimm’s articles in Berner Tagwacht and
Neues Leben about the majority and the minority).  
 

Try to make friends with the French internees, start corresponding with
them, make contacts, found (a secret and informal) group of
Lefts among them. Most important!  

The slogan of “a mass movement” is not bad, but it is not
completely correct. Because it forgets the revolution, the
conquest of power, the dictatorship of the
proletariat. N.B. this!! Or more correctly: the support and
development (at once) of every kind of revolutionary mass actions,
with the object of bringing nearer the revolution, etc.


Platten = a muddlehead. With Scheidemann or with Liebknecht? he asks,
not understanding that the very thing Grimm is doing is “reconciling”,
uniting, confusing the Swiss social-patriots (Greulich and Co.)
and the Swiss “Left”, who are quite politically unconscious!!!


You are right: revolutionary struggle against the high cost of
living, strikes, demonstrations, etc., at once. At once “go to
the people”, i.e., to the masses, to the majority of the
oppressed, preaching the socialist revolution (i.e., taking over
the banks and all large-scale enterprises).  

Very best wishes.  

Yours,
Lenin

February 17, 1917 

Dear A. M., 

We had your letter today, and were very glad to get it. For a long time
we did not know that you were in America, and had no letters from you
except one, telling us that you were leaving America.  

I wrote to you on January 7–8 (the day the letter was forwarded from
Stockholm—all the letters direct from here to America are intercepted by
the French!), but evidently this letter (with an article for Novy
Mir) did not reach you while you were still in New York.  

Pleasant as it was to learn from you of the victory of N. Iv. and
Pavlov in Novy Mir (I get this newspaper devilishly irregularly;
it must be the fault of the post and not the dispatch department of the
paper itself), it was just as sad to read about the bloc between Trotsky
and the Right for the struggle against N. Iv. What a swine this Trotsky
is—Left phrases, and a bloc with the Right against the Zimmerwald Left!!
He ought to be exposed (by you) if only in a brief letter to
Sotsial-Demokrat!  

I have already received No. 1 of The Internationalist, and am
very glad of it. I have inadequate information about the conference of the
S.L.P. and the S.P. on January 6–7, 1917. It appears that the S.L.P. is
throwing out all its minimum programme (there is a temptation and a danger
for Bukharin, who has been stumbling “at that there spot” since
1915!!). It is a great pity that I cannot collect all the documents about
the S.L.P. (I asked Bukharin about it, but letters clearly get lost). Have
you any material? I could return it after reading.  
 

I am preparing (have almost got the material ready) an article on the
question of the attitude of Marxism to the
state.[5] I have come to conclusions which are even sharper against
Kautsky than against Bukharin (have you seen his “Nota Bene” in No. 6 of
Jugend-Internationale?  and Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata
No. 2[1]

?).

The question is exceptionally important. Bukharin is far better than
Kautsky, but Bukharin s mistakes may destroy this “just cause”
in the struggle with Kautskianism.  

I will send you my article about self-determination against
     P. Kievsky.[2]

What a pity we have no money! We would publish Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata No. 3 (all the material is ready and
waiting) and No. 4 (Bukharin’s article about the state, which we
rejected at first, and my article on the state)!  

The Zimmerwald Right, in my opinion, has ideologically buried
Zimmerwald: Bourderon + Merrheim in Paris voted for pacifism,
Kautsky also on January 7, 1917 in Berlin, Turati (December 17, 4916!!) and
the whole Italian party also. This is the death of Zimmerwald!! In words
they condemned “social-pacifism” (see the Kienthal resolution),
while in practice they have turned towards it!!  

Grimm has basely turned towards the social-patriots within the Swiss
party (our friend in Stockholm will send you material about it), entering
into a bloc with them on January 7, 1917
  (Parteivorstandssitzung[3]

)

against the Left for postponement of the Congress!! And now he has
even more basely attacked the Left for the Begründung des
 Referendums[4]

(we shall send it to you) and drawn up a “mid way”, “Centrist”
resolution. Have you got the Zurich Volksrecht, or can you get
it?? If not, we shall send you something, or try to.  

Tomorrow (February 18) is the Congress of the Swedish party. Probably a
split?  It seems as though there are devilish dissension and
confusion among the
Young.[6] Do you

    

know Swedish? Could you arrange contributions (by me and other Lefts) to
the newspaper of the Swedish Young?  

Please reply, if only briefly, but quickly and regularly,
because it’s terribly important for us to organise good correspondence with
you.  

Best greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin

Dear Friend, 

The other day we had a gratifying letter from Moscow (we shall soon
send you a copy, although the text is uninteresting). They write that the
mood of the masses is a good one, that chauvinism is clearly declining and
that probably our day will come. The organisation, they say, is suffering
from the fact that the adults are at the front, while in the factories
there are young people and women. But the fighting spirit, they say, is not
any the less. They send us the copy of a leaflet (a good one) issued by the
Moscow Bureau of the Central
Committee.[1] We shall print it in the next issue of the Central Organ.


Richard is himself again! It’s difficult for people to live, and for
our Party in particular. But still they do live.  

There is also a letter from Kollontai, who (let this be entre
nous for the time being) has returned to Norway from
America. N. Iv. and Pavlov (the Lett who was in Brussels:
Pavel Vasilyevich) had won Novy Mir, she says (I get this
paper very irregularly), but ... Trotsky arrived, and this scoundrel at
once ganged up with the Right wing of Novy Mir against
the Left Zimmerwaldists!!  That’s it!! That’s Trotsky for you!! Always true
to himself=twists, swindles, poses as a Left, helps the Right, so
long as he can....  

Among the Left in America, she says, things are not going badly, though
Kollontai is afraid of anarcho-syndicalist tendencies in the
S.L.P. (N. Iv., she says, is not afraid of this). I have read in the
S.L.P. organ (The Weekly People)[2] that they are throwing
overboard their minimum programme.... N. Iv. has been stumbling “at that
there

    

spot” since 1915. I fear for him! But the post to America is not
working.  

I have been putting in a lot of study recently on the question of the
attitude of Marxism to the state; I have collected a lot of
material and arrived, it seems to me, at very interesting and important
conclusions, much more against Kautsky than against
N. Iv. Bukharin (who, how ever, is not right all the same, though
nearer to the truth than Kautsky). I would terribly much like to
write about this: perhaps publish No. 4 of Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata with Bukharin’s article, and with my discussion of
his little mistakes and Kautsky’s big lying and vulgarisation of Marxism.



Nadya is ill: she has caught bronchitis and has a
   temperature. It looks as though she will be in bed for some time. I called
   in the doctor today.  


Wells and what about your visit to La Chaux-de-Fonds? Have you given up
this idea altogether, and all your plans about work in French Switzerland?
You should not let that drop. Things here, as I wrote, are not very good,
yet today we have finished leaflet
No.I[3] (“the Swiss group of Zimmerwald Lefts”). We shall
see what happens!  

If not now, then in general (i.e., a little later) we shall succeed (I
am sure)—if not we, then our successors—in building up a Left
trend in Switzerland. The ground for this exists!  

Have you read the propositions of the Left at the Congress of the
Zurich cantonal party at
Töss,[4] February 11, 1917? in Volksrecht?  Not bad all the
same, eh?  


All the very best greetings and handshakes. Excuse the scribble on the last
page: I am being hurried.  

Yours,
Lenin 

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Moscow Bureau’s leaflet which Lenin mentions was not published in
the Party’s central organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, because in January
1917, after the publication of No. 58, the paper closed down.  

The Moscow Bureau of the Central Committee was at the time the leading
body of the Moscow Regional Bolshevik Party organisation. Among the
Bureau’s members were Rozalia Zemlyachka, M. S. Olminsky and
I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov.





[2]
The Weekly People—organ of the Socialist Labour Party of
America, founded in New York in 1891.





[3]
Reference is to Leaflet No. 4, “Gegen die Lüge der
Vaterlandsverteidigung” (“Against the Lie about Defence of the
Fatherland”), which was later published over the signature of the “Group
of Zimmerwald Lefts in Switzerland”. Lenin was closely concerned with the
writing and editing of this leaflet. It included the “Proposed Amendments
to the Resolution on the War Issue” and a number of other writings by
Lenin.





[4]
The Congress of the Zurich Social-Democratic organisation in Töss was
held on February 11 and 12, 1917. It discussed the Social-Democratic
attitude to militarism and war. Two draft resolutions were moved: =

(1) a resolution drafted by the Rights in a spirit of social-chauvinism and
=

(2) a Centrist draft approved by the majority of the leaders of the Swiss
Social-Democratic Party. =

The majority resolution was passed by 93 votes to 65. To prevent the
social-chauvinist resolution being adopted, the Lefts voted for the
majority resolution, but moved amendments drafted by Lenin (see present
edition, Vol. 23, p. 282). The Lefts’ motion containing these amendments
received 32 votes. The materials of the Congress were published in the
newspaper Volksrecht.

March 5, 1917 

Dear A. M., 

Newspaper reports speak of a congress of the Young being called in
Sweden on May 12 to found a new party “on Zimmerwald principles”.  

I must admit that this news particularly disturbs and angers me. For
“Zimmerwald” is clearly bankrupt, and a good word is once again serving
to cover up decay! The Zimmerwald majority—Turati and Co., Kautsky and
Ledebour, Merrheim—have all gone over to the position of
social-pacifism, condemned so solemnly (and so fruitlessly!) at
Kienthal. The manifesto of Kautsky and Co. of January 7, 1917, a number of
resolutions of the Italian Socialist Party, the resolutions of
Merrheim—Jouhaux and Longuet—Bourderon (+Raffin-Dugens in
unity with Renaudel), is not this the bankruptcy of Zimmerwald?
And the Zimmerwald “Centre”—R. Grimm, who on January 7, 1917 entered
into an alliance with the social-patriots of Switzerland to fight
the Left!!  Grimm, who abuses the social-patriots of all countries
except the Swiss, whom he covers up! C’est
     dégo&uhattant![1]

I am beside myself with fury at these scoundrels; it is revolting to listen
to them and to hear about them; it is even more revolting to think of
working with them. Buffoonery!  

We intend to collect material for you about this bankruptcy of
R. Grimm. Write whether you can get the Zurich Volksrecht. You
will find the principal material there in

    

the preamble to the referendum, in the resolution of the
Left at Töss (February 11, 1917), etc., etc.  

But the majority of the Swedish Left, I am sure, are
sincere. This is clear. And it is necessary at all costs to help them
before May 12 to understand beforehand the utter banality of
social-pacifism and Kautskianism, all the vileness of the Zimmerwald
majority, to help them work out a good programme and tactics for
themselves, for the new party.  

Really, we must (all of us, the Left in Sweden and those who can get
into touch with them) unite, bend every effort, help—for the moment in
the life of the Swedish party, the Swedish and Scandinavian labour
movement, is a decisive one.  

Since you read Swedish (and speak it too), a considerable share of
responsibility falls on you, if we understand “internationalism” not in
the sense of “it’s no concern of mine”.  

I am sure you are doing a great deal. One would like to rally and unite
the Lefts to help the Swedes at such a difficult moment in their
life. Could not one organise in Christiania, Copenhagen and Stockholm for
this purpose a group of Russian Bolsheviks and Lefts who know Swedish and
can help? The work could be divided: to collect the main documents and
articles (I was sent the polemic between Nerman and Mauritz Västberg in
Politiken of November 28, 1916 on the theme, “first a programme,
then a new party”—but I could not unterstand
it); to work out one’s own theses to help them; to print a number of
articles to aid them. Swedes able to write in German, French or
English could also enter such a
group.[2]


What is your opinion, is this possible or not? Is it worth while
worrying with it?  

My opinion is that it is worth while, but of course I am not in a
position to judge from far away, outside. I only see and know in
the firmest way possible that the question of the programme and tactics of
a new socialism, genuinely revolutionary Marxism and not rotten
Kautskianism, is
    

on the agenda everywhere. This is clear both from the S.L.P. and
The Internationalist in America, and from the data about Germany
(the resolutions of the Lefts, January 7, 1917) and about France (the
pamphlet of the Lefts in Paris, Les socialistes de Zimmerwald et la
     guerre[3]

),

and so on.  

In Denmark Trier and others would, I am sure, join in the
cause of setting up a new, Marxist, party in Scandinavia; part of
the Norwegian Lefts also. The struggle with Branting and Co. is a serious
business: necessity must force them to take a more serious
attitude to questions of the theory and tactics of revolutionary Marxism.


In my opinion, the work of preparing for May 12 should be pushed
intensively, and from three sides simultaneously:
(1) the assistance group mentioned earlier;
(2) groups of the Scandinavian Lefts: write an article (in the Swedish
papers) about the necessity of founding at once such groups to
prepare a programme and tactics for May 12.  

(3)—the third interests me particularly, not because it is
the most important (initiative from within is more important), but because
we can help here. If, for example, you were immediately,
after looking through the main literature of the Left and Right in Sweden,
to rough out on the basis of it theses on these lines: 

theoretical (programme) and practical (tactical) differences 






defence of the fatherland;


conception of imperialism;


character of the war;


disarmament;


social-pacifism;






+ dicta-

torship

of the

prole-

tariat


 {{ 


the nationalities question;


revolution;


“mass actions”;


civil war;


attitude to trade, unions;


opportunism and struggle against it, etc.




 

Every thesis should include (a) what has been said about it (“the
essence”) by the Left in Sweden; (b) by the Right there.  

On this basis, taking account of the position of the Left in Russia,
Germany and America (the main countries in this respect), we could work out
our own theses and, by publishing them in Swedish, help the Swedes
to make preparations for May 12.  

Some of the main points from the most important
resolutions and articles of the Right and the Left wing in Sweden ought for
this purpose to be translated into Russian or German, or French, or
English.  

In essence, morally and politically, we are all responsible for the
Swedish Young and must help them.  

You are in an exceptionally favourable position to give such aid. Write
at once what you think about it.  

It would be useful, probably, to send this letter on to Lyudmila also,
together with your views.  

All the very best. I wish you every success.  

Yours,
Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I enclose the leaflet and my best congratulations on it.  

Don’t give it to anyone as yet: it would be a good thing if no one knew
that it comes partly from the Russians. May not Usiyevich or
someone near him have blabbed?  

Let the distribution be made by the Swiss groups.  

We here in Zurich are in a state of agitation today: there is a
telegram in Zürcher Post and in Neue Zürcher Zeitung
of March 15 that in Russia the revolution was victorious in
Petrograd on March 14 after three days of struggle, that 12 members of the
Duma are in power and the ministers have all been arrested.  

If the Germans are not lying, then it’s true.  

That Russia has for the last few days been on the eve of
revolution is beyond doubt.  

I am beside myself that I cannot go to Scandinavia!! I will
not forgive myself for not risking the journey in 1915!  

Best greetings.  

Yours,
Lenin

March 16, 1917 

Dear A. M., 

We have just received the second set of government telegrams about the
revolution of March 1 (14) in Petrograd. A week of bloody battles by the
workers—and Milyukov + Guchkov +
Kerensky[3] in power!!  On the “old” European pattern....  

Well, what of it! This “first stage of the first revolution (among
those engendered by the war)” will not be the last, nor will it be only
Russian. Of course, we shall continue to be against defence of the
fatherland, against the imperialist slaughter controlled by
Shingaryov[4] + Kerensky and Co.  

All our watchwords remain the same. In the last issue of
Sotsial-Demokrat we actually spoke of the possibility of a
government “of Milyukov and Guchkov, if not of Milyukov and
     Kerensky”.[1]

It turned out that it was both... and: all three
together. Lovely! We shall see how the party of people’s freedom (after
all, it’s in a majority in the new ministry, since
Konovalov[5] is even just a little “more Left”, while Kerensky is
certainly more Left!) will give the people freedom, bread and peace.... We
shall see!  

The main thing now is the press and the organisation of the workers in
a revolutionary Social-Democratic party.
Chkhenkeli[6] must now (he promised!) provide funds for “defence of
the fatherland”. While Mr. Chkheidze, although he did utter ultra-Left
speeches during the revolution or on its eve (when Yefremov, too,
spoke in no less

    

rrrevolutionary fashion), of course, does not
deserve one atom of confidence after all his “politics” with
Potresov and Co., with Chkhenkeli, etc. It would be the greatest misfortune
if the Cadets were now to promise a legal workers’ party, and if our people
accepted “unity” with Chkheidze and Co.!!  

But this will not happen. First, the Cadets will not allow anyone a
legal workers’ party except the Potresovs and Co. Secondly, if they do
allow it, we shall set up as before our own separate party and
without fail combine legal work with illegal.  

On no account a repetition of something like the Second
International!  On no account with Kautsky! Definitely a more
revolutionary programme and tactics (there are elements of it in
K. Liebknecht, the S.L.P. in America, the Dutch Marxists, etc.) and
definitely the combination of legal and illegal work. Republican
propaganda, the struggle against imperialism, as before
revolutionary propaganda, agitation and struggle with the aim of an
international proletarian revolution and the conquest of power by
the “Soviets of Workers’ Deputies” (and not the Cadet swindlers).  

After the “great rebellion” of 1905—the “glorious
     revolution”[2]

of 1917!...  

Be so kind as to forward this letter to Lyudmila, and drop me a line as
to how far we are in agreement, or how far we differ, and also as to the
plans of A. M., etc. If our
deputies[7] are allowed to return, one must definitely be brought for a
couple of weeks to Scandinavia. All the best.  

Yours,
Lenin

March 17, 1917 

Dear A.M., 

I have just had your telegram, worded so that it sounds almost ironical
(just imagine thinking about “directives” from here, when news is
exceptionally meagre, while in Petersburg there are probably not only
effectively leading comrades of our Party, but also formally commissioned
representatives of the Central Committee!).  

Only just this minute I have read the telegram of the Peters burg
Telegraph Agency of the 17th giving the programme of the new government,
and the news about Bonar Law’s statement that the tsar has not yet
abdicated and that no one knows where he is.  

Yesterday it seemed that the Guchkov-Milyukov government was already
completely victorious and had already come to an agreement with the
dynasty. Today the situation is that the dynasty does not exist and the
tsar has fled, clearly preparing for a counter-revolution!...  

We have begun working out theses which we shall perhaps finish this
evening and then, naturally, will immediately forward to you. If possible,
wait for these theses, which correct (resp. cancel) what I am
writing now in my own name only, so far.  

—Zinoviev and I have just managed to draw up a first draft of the
theses, a rough one, very unsatisfactory in the editorial sense
(of course, we shall not print it in this form) but giving, I
hope, an idea of the main point.  

We earnestly ask you to acquaint Yuri and Eug. B. with it, and also
Lyudmila, and likewise to drop us at least a

    

line or two before you
leave[1]

—and

also make certain to arrange with someone who is staying
in Norway to forward our material to Russia and Russian
material to us. Please do this, and ask this comrade remaining behind (or a
Norwegian comrade who knows German, French or English) to be
exceptionally efficient. We shall send money for the expenses.


In my opinion, the main thing now is not to let oneself get entangled
in stupid “unification” attempts with the social-patriots (or, what is
still more dangerous, with the wobblers like the Organising Committee,
Trotsky and Co.) and to continue the work of our Party in a
consistently internationalist spirit.  

What is now on the agenda is expansion of the work, organisation of the
masses, awakening of new sections—the backward, the rural, domestic
servants—Party cells in the forces for systematic and detailed
 Entlarvung[2]

of the new government, and preparation for the conquest of power by the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies. Only such a power can give
bread, peace and liberty.  

What is needed today is to finish off the reactionaries, not a
shadow of confidence or support for the new government (not a shadow
of confidence in Kerensky,
Gvozdyov,[3] Chkhenkeli,
Chkheidze[4] and Co.)  and armed temporising, armed
preparation of a wider base for a higher stage.


If there is freedom of the press, republish (as material for the
history of the recent past) our writings here, and inform us by cable
whether we can help by writing from here through Scandinavia. We are afraid
that it will be some time before we succeed in leaving accursed
Switzerland.  

All the best.  

Yours,
Lenin 

I wish you every kind of success!  
 

P.S. I am afraid that there will now be an epidemic in
Petersburg “simply” of excitement, without systematic work on a party of
a new type. It must not be à la “Second
International”. Wider! Raise up new elements! Awaken a new initiative, new
organisations in all sections, and prove to them that
peace will be brought only by an armed Soviet of Workers’
Deputies, if it takes power.

Dear Vyach. Al., 

I am considering every possible way of
     travelling.[1]

The following is an absolute secret. Please reply to me immediately and,
perhaps, best by express (I think we won’t ruin the Party by a dozen extra
express letters), so that I can be sure no one has read the letter.  

Take out papers in your own name for travelling to France and England,
and I will use them to travel through England (and
Holland) to Russia.  

I can put on a wig.  

The photograph will be taken of me with the wig on, and
I shall go to the Consulate in Berne with your papers and wearing
the wig.  

You must then disappear from Geneva for a minimum of a few weeks (until
my telegram arrives from Scandinavia):
for this period you must hide yourself well away in the mountains, where,
we shall, of course, pay for your board and
lodging.  

If you agree, begin preparations immediately in the most
energetic (and most secret) fashion, and drop me a line at once in any
case.  

Yours,
Lenin 

Think over all the practical steps involved and write to me in
detail. I am writing to you because I am convinced that between us
everything will remain absolutely secret.

Dear Comrade, 

I have sent you (through Inessa) copies of two of my articles for
Pravda—for information, to co-ordinate our views.  

I need them back on Monday: if necessary, send them express
and take them to the station.  

Be careful about blocs with the
Nachalo[1] people: we are against rapprochement with other
parties, are for warning the workers against
Chkheidze. Essential! Chkheidze is clearly wobbling: cf. how he is being
praised in the Temps of March 22 and in many other papers. We are
for the C.C. in Russia, for Pravda, for our
Party, for a proletarian militia preparing the way for peace and
socialism.  

Greetings! 

Yours,
Lenin

Dear Comrade Anatoly Vasilyevich, 

As regards a conference, my personal opinion (I am sending on
your letter to Zinoviev) is that it is expedient now only between people
who are ready to warn the proletariat not only against the Gvozdyov
supporters,[2] but also against the waverings of Chkheidze.


In this, I believe, is the essence of our inner-Party and, if one may
use the term, near-Party situation.  

It is just for this reason that I am not wasting time on a
single conference with Martov and Co.  

Independence and separateness of our Party, no rapprochement with
other parties, are indispensable conditions for me. Without this one
cannot help the proletariat to move through the democratic
revolution to the commune, and I would not serve any other ends.


I personally would be for a conference with people and groups
who agree on this basic point.  

I should be very glad to have a talk with you, without any formal
conferences, and should consider it valuable for myself personally
(and for the cause).  

With all my heart I congratulate you, too, and shake your hand, and
send greetings as well from N. K. to you both.  

With fraternal greetings,

 Lenin 

My address:

 Wl. Uljanow. Spiegelgasse. 14II (bei
Kammerer). Zürich. I.  

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was written in reply to a letter from A. V. Lunacharsky,
who was to visit Zurich in March 1917 and had suggested to Lenin that there
should be a joint conference of Bolsheviks and Vperyod
supporters. Lenin turned down the proposal.





[2]
Gvozdyov (see also Note 288) was leader of the so-called
“Workers’ Group” under the Central War Industries Committee, set up by
the Russian bourgeoisie in 1915.

Dear Comrade, 

I have sent you through Inessa copies of my two letters to
Pravda. I hope you have done what I asked, and today (Sunday) or
tomorrow have sent them back to me by express.  

After Tuesday (I am lecturing here on Tuesday evening) I will send you
a copy of letter
No. 3.[1]

Then, I think, it will be easy for us to come to an agreement
about tactics.  

Lunacharsky has written to me proposing a “conference”.  I have
replied: I am agreeable to having a talk with you (Lunacharsky)
     personally.[2]

(He will be coming to Zurich.)  I am agreeable to a conference, however,
only on condition that the workers are warned against the
waverings of Chkheidze. He (Lunacharsky) has said nothing.  

So it means that we shall confine ourselves to a personal
talk.  

Chkheidze is obviously wobbling: cf. Le Temps of
March 22 praises Chkheidze, while on March 24 it abuses
him.  

The picture is clear!!  

Therefore I am a little afraid that you have been in too much of a
hurry to draw up a general
resolution[5] (I have sent it to Pravda today, together with
my article, addressed to Herrn Fürstenberg, Boulevard Hotel,
Kristiania. You can send articles there, with a note that the
articles are for Pravda, and that I supplied the address; as to
articles on questions of principle, it would be useful for us to
reach preliminary agreement).  
 

Pravda, probably, needs articles. At any rate I am
writing, and I am advising all friends to write.  

I fear that you are too much in a hurry also to unite with the
Vperyod group.  

In your resolution the ending is good (I had time only to look through
it rapidly: it had to go off), but the beginning (about democracy
in general) seemed to me very bad.  

As regards unity with Vperyod. I sent a telegram to
Scandinavia to the members of our Party who are leaving: 

“Notre tactique: méfiance absolue, aucun soutien nouveau
gouvernement, Kerensky surtout soup&ctailonnons, armement proletariat
seule garantie, élection immédiate douma de Petrograd
aucun rapprochement autres
    partis.”[3]


The last is conditio sine qua non.  

We don’t trust Chkheidze.  

Our deputies and Kamenev are already in Petersburg,
or will be there in a few days. There is a Central
Committee in Petersburg (Frankfurter Zeitung printed extracts
from its manifesto, lovely!), Pravda exists. We are for
preservation of this party absolutely, against all
fusions with the Organising Committee.  

(Probably there is no O.C. in Petersburg, since
Frankfurter Zeitung and Vossische Zeitung gave a detailed
account of the manifesto of Chkheidze and Co. of
March 16,[6] and there is not a word about the O.C. there.)


It is precisely for the elections to the Constituent Assembly (or for
the overthrow of the government of Guchkov and Milyukov) that we must
have a separate party, ours, which has in my opinion
completely justified itself during the years 1914–17.  

That means? Do the Vperyodists want; honestly to join this
party?  

Bon!  

They don’t want to? I won’t agree to “concessions” and
“bargaining”.  
 

Have a talk with them, as man to man and more than
once, and drop me a line, so that I have your reply by Tuesday (or at
latest Wednesday morning).  

Will you undertake to type in two copies (or in one copy) my
      manuscript[4]

of 500 pages (written on octavo), for payment not less than last
time? I would then publish it at once in Petersburg.  

You will oblige me greatly!  

Reply. 

All the best.  

Yours,
Lenin 

P.S. Lyudmila has left Stockholm. Don’t use Stockholm as an
address!  

P.P.S. Will you and Olga go to Russia, if there is an opportunity, and
when? Who else would go from Geneva?

Dear Friend, 

You must be in an excessively nervous state. This is my explanation for
a number of theoretical “oddities” in your letters.  

We should not distinguish the first and the second revolution, or the
first and the second stage??  

That’s just what we have to do. Marxism requires that we should
distinguish the classes which are in action. In Russia it is
not the same class as before that is in power. Consequently, the
revolution which lies ahead is quite, quite different.  

My phrase about support of the workers by the Milyukovs has (it seemed
to me) a clear sense; if the Milyukovs really wanted to finish off
the monarchy, they should have supported the workers. Only that!


One must not make a “fetish” out of revolution. Kerensky is a
revolutionary, but a chatterbox, a petty liar, a deceiver of the
workers. It is almost certain that even in the Petrograd “Soviet
of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies” the majority has been fooled
by him (with the help of the wobbling and muddling Chkheidze). And what
will happen to the countryside?  

It is quite possible that for a time the majority
both of the workers and of the peasants will really be for the
imperialist war (which the Guchkovs + Milyukovs are representing as
“defence of the Republic”).  

It would be a good thing if someone with free time (better still a
group, but if one doesn’t exist, then at least an

    

individual) undertook to collect all the telegrams (and articles
if possible) in all the foreign newspapers about the Russian
revolution.  

There are mountains of material. It is impossible to follow it all.


Probably we won’t manage to get to Russia!! Britain will
not let us through. It can’t be done through Germany.  

Greetings! 

Lenin

March 30, 1917 

Dear Comrade, 

I thank you with all my heart for the trouble you are taking and for
your help. I cannot, of course, make use of the services of people who are
connected with the publisher of Die
Glocke.[5] I cabled you today that the only hope of breaking out
of here is by an exchange of emigrants in Switzerland for German
internees. Britain will on no account let me through, or any
internationalists at all, neither Martov and his friends nor Natanson and
his friends. The British sent Chernov back to France, although he had all
his papers for transit!! It is clear that the Russian proletarian
revolution has no more malignant enemy than the British imperialists. It is
clear that Milyukov (and Co.), agents of Anglo-French imperialist capital,
and Russian imperialists themselves, are capable of everything—deception,
treachery, and everything else—in order to prevent the internationalists
returning to Russia. The least confidence in this respect either in
Milyukov or in Kerensky (an empty chatterer, an agent of the Russian
imperialist bourgeoisie in his objective role) would be simply ruinous for
the working-class movement and for our Party, and would border on betrayal
of internationalism. The only—without exaggeration, the only—hope for
us to get to Russia is to send as soon as possible a reliable person to
Russia, to secure from the government, by pressure from the
“Soviet of Workers’ Deputies”, an exchange of all the emigrants
in Switzerland for interned Germans. It is necessary to act with the
maximum

    

energy, making a record of every step, not sparing expense on telegrams,
and collecting documents against Milyukov and Co., who are capable of
dragging matters out, feeding us with promises, swindling, etc. You can
imagine what torture it is for all of us to be sitting here at such a time.


Furthermore, the dispatch of a reliable person to Russia is still
more necessary for reasons of principle. The latest information in the
foreign press gives clearer and clearer indications that the government,
with the direct help of Kerensky and thanks to the (putting it mildly)
unforgivable wobblings of Chkheidze, is swindling—and swindling not
without success—the working class, representing the imperialist war
as a “defensive” one. Judging from the telegram of the St. Petersburg
Telegraph Agency of March 30, 1917, Chkheidze has allowed himself to be
completely deceived by this slogan, adopted also by the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies—if this source, generally unreliable of course, is to be
believed. At all events, even if the report is untrue, the danger
of such a deception is all the same undoubtedly vast. All the
efforts of our Party must be concentrated on fighting it. Our Party would
disgrace itself for ever, commit political suicide, if it tolerated such a
deception. To judge from one report, Muranov returned from Kronstadt
together with Skobelev. If Muranov went there on behalf
of the Provisional Government of the Guchkovs and Milyukovs, I very much
ask you to pass on (through someone reliable), and to print, that
I absolutely condemn this, that any rapprochement with those who
are wobbling in the direction of social-patriotism and have taken up the
profoundly mistaken, profoundly harmful social-pacifist, Kautskian,
position of Chkheidze and Co. is, I am deeply convinced, harmful
for the working class, dangerous, inadmissible.  

I hope you have received my “Letters from Afar”
      Nos. 1–4,[1]

in which I developed the theoretical and political foundation for these
views. If these letters have been lost, or did not reach Petrograd, please
cable me, and I will send you copies.  
 

There is no doubt that in the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Deputies there are numerous, even, it seems,
a majority of
(1) supporters of Kerensky, a most dangerous
agent of the imperialist bourgeoisie, pursuing
imperialism, i.e., the defence and justification of a plundering war
of conquest on Russia’s part, under cover of an ocean of
sounding phrases and empty promises,
(2) supporters of
Chkheidze, who is wobbling hopelessly in the direction of
social-patriotism and sharing all (he philistinism and
stupidity of Kautskianism. Our Party is obliged to carry on the
most stubborn, the most highly principled, the most
pressing and most merciless struggle against both currents. And
I personally will not hesitate for a second to declare, and to
declare in print, that I shall prefer even an immediate split
with anyone in our Party, whoever it may be, to making
concessions to the social-patriotism of Kerensky and Co. or the
social-pacifism and Kautskianism of Chkheidze and Co.


I must at all costs demand the republication in Petrograd
—if only under the title: From the History of the Last Years
of Tsarism—of the Sotsial-Demokrat published here, of the
pamphlet by Lenin and Zinoviev on the war and
socialism,[6]
of Kommunist and Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata. But most of
all, and first of all, the theses in No. 47 of Sotsial-Demokrat
(of October 13,
1915).[2]

These theses are now exceptionally
important.

These theses say directly, clearly, precisely how we should
act in a revolution in Russia, and they do it 1 1/2 years before
the revolution.

These theses have boon remarkably, literally confirmed
by the revolution.

The war has not ceased, and cannot cease, to be
imperialist on the part of Russia, so long as
(1) the landowners and
capitalists, representatives of the bourgeois class, are in
power;
(2) so long as such direct agents and servants of that
bourgeoisie as Kerensky and the other social-patriots are
in power;
(3) so long as the treaties between tsarism and the
Anglo-French imperialists remain in force (the Guchkov–
Milyukov government has openly declared abroad—I don’t

    

know whether it has done so in Russia—that it is loyal to
these treaties). They are robber treaties, for the seizure of
Galicia, Armenia, Constantinople, etc., etc.;
(4) so long as
these treaties have not been published and not annulled;
(5)
so long as the whole alliance between Russia and the
Anglo-French bourgeois, imperialist governments has not been
broken off altogether;
(6) so long as state power in Russia has
not passed from the imperialist bourgeoisie (mere promises
and “pacifist” declarations, however much the stupid
Kautsky, Chkheidze and Co. believe in them, do not transform the
bourgeoisie into a non-bourgeoisie) into the hands of the
proletariat, which alone is capable, on condition that it is
supported by the poorer section of the peasantry, of breaking
not merely in words but in deeds with the interests of capital,
with imperialist policy, with the plundering of other
countries, of emancipating the peoples oppressed by the Great
Russians completely, withdrawing the troops from Armenia
and Galicia at once, etc.;
(7) only the proletariat is capable,
if it rids itself of the influence of its national bourgeoisie,
of winning the genuine confidence of the proletarians of all
the belligerent countries, and entering into peace
negotiations with them;
(8) these proletarian peace terms are set
forth precisely and clearly both in No 47 of Sotsial–
Demokrat and in my letter No. 4.

Hence it is clear that the watchword: “We are now
defending the Republic in Russia, we are now carrying on a ‘
defensive war’, we shall fight Wilhelm, we are lighting for the
overthrow of Wilhelm”
is the greatest deception, the greatest
swindling of the workers!! For Guchkov-Lvov-Milyukov
and Co. are landowners and capitalists, representatives
of the class of landowners and capitalists, imperialists who
are fighting for the same robber ends, on the basis of the same
robber treaties concluded by tsarism, in alliance with the
same imperialist robber bourgeoisie of Britain, France and
Italy.

The appeal to the Germans by the bourgeois and 
imperialist republic in Russia—“Overthrow Wilhelm”—is a
repetition of the lying slogan of the French social–
chauvinists, traitors to socialism, Jules Guesde, Sembat and Co.

In a very popular way, very clearly, without learned words,
it must be explained to the workers and soldiers that it is

    

not only Wilhelm who has to be overthrown, but also the
kings of Great Britain and Italy. That is first of all. And
secondly, and most important, the bourgeois governments must
be overthrown, beginning with Russia—for otherwise peace
cannot be won. It may be that we cannot immediately
“overthrow” the government of Guchkov-Milyukov. That
may be so. But that is not an argument for telling an
untruth!! The workers must be told the truth. We have to say
that the government of Guchkov-Milyukov and Co. is an
imperialist government, that the workers and peasants
must first of all (now or after elections to the Constituent
Assembly, if it is not used to deceive the people, if the
elections are not postponed until after the war—the question of
choice of moment cannot be decided from here), first of all
must transfer all state power into the hands of the working
class, the enemy of capital, the enemy of imperialist war,
and only then will they have the right to appeal for the
overthrow of all kings and all bourgeois governments.

For God’s sake try and deliver all this to Petrograd and
to Pravda, to Muranov and Kamenev and the others. For
God’s sake make every effort to send this with a most
reliable person. It would be best of all if a reliable sensible chap
like Kuba went (he would perform a great service to the whole
world working-class movement) and helped our friends in
Petrograd!! I hope you will do this!! Do everything in your
power.

Conditions in Petrograd are exceptionally difficult. The
republican patriots are straining every effort. They are
trying to drown our Party in slander and dirt (the
Chernomazov “affair”: I am sending a document about
it[3]

),

etc., etc.

There cannot be any confidence in Chkheidze and Co., or
Sukhanov or Steklov and the like. No rapprochement with
other parties, any of them! Not a shadow of confidence in or
support for the government of Guchkov-Milyukov and Co.!!
The most irreconcilable propaganda of internationalism and
of struggle with republican chauvinism and social–
chauvinism everywhere, both in the press and within the Soviet of
Workers’ Deputies: the organisation of our Party: this is

    

the essential. Kamenev must realise that he bears a world–
historic responsibility.[7]

Don’t grudge money on communications between
Stockholm and Petrograd!!

I beg you very much, dear comrade, to cable me on
receipt of this letter, and generally to keep me au courant in
every respect. I hope the Swedish friends will also help in
this.

All the best.

Yours,
 Lenin

In 1918 it was republished by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Red

[7]
Lenin stresses the responsibility borne by Kamenev because Kamenev, who
had returned to Petrograd from exile on March 12 1917, had become one of
the editors of Pravda and a representative of the Bolshevik Party
in the Petrograd Soviet.  

Kamenev, however, adopted a semi-Menshevik position on certain vital
aspects of Party policy. In articles published in Pravda he argued
that the Bolsheviks should give the Provisional Government conditional
support, while exerting pressure to make it open peace negotiations at
once. In his assessment of the war Kamenev leaned towards
defencism. Kamenev’s position was sharply criticised by Lenin in his
pamphlet Letters on Tactics (see present edition, Vol. 24,
pp. 42–54).

Dear Friends,

And so we are leaving through Germany on Wednesday.

Tomorrow this will be dually decided.

We shall send you a mass of packages containing our
books, papers and I lungs, requesting yon to forward them
in turn to Stockholm for transshipment to us in Petrograd.

We shall also send you money and credentials from
the Central Committee authorising yon to carry on all
correspondence and manage affairs.

We are thinking of publishing a leaflet, “Farewell Letter
to the Swiss
Workers”[1]

in German, in French and in Italian.

Inessa will not have time to do the French translation:
I hope you will do it and publish it (with Guilbeaux).

A comrade hero (who knows German and Italian), Julius
Mimiola, has promised me ho will do the Italian
translation and publish if.

(Krummgasse. 2.)

Zürich. 4.

I have given him your address. When you have the
German pamphlet, send it to him (and a letter in German) and
money for publication.

((Here is another address for you of a Left-wing German
here, who published leaflet No. 1 of the Zimmerwald Left,
and may be useful again for publications: Herrn Karl Schnepf.
Thurwiesenstrasse. 8. Zürich.
I will give him your address.))

Very best greetings and thousands of wishes.

All the best.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

P.S. We hope to collect the journey money for about 12
persons, because the comrades in Stockholm have helped us
very much.




P.S. Please take 2–3 copies, on the thinnest possible
paper, of my letters No. 1 and No. 2 to Pravda “(Letters from
Afar”), to send (for the information of comrades) to Paris
and elsewhere in Switzerland.

We shall hand over correspondence with Paris to you. You
will have to find a bookbinder (a most reliable one) for
sending letters to Paris in bindings (and to learn chemical
writing).




P.P.S. Come to a detailed agreement about correspondence
with Chaux-de-Fonds, and about publishing my
speech,[2]
with Abramovich (notify him that he should hurry up with
his preparations for travelling: we are going on Wednesday).

This letter was written in reply to a letter from A. V. Lunacharsky,

April 12, 1917

Dear Friend,

I hope that this letter will all the same reach you, and
also the newspapers which are being sent to you. I say “all
the same” because the difficulties of communication with
foreign countries are incredibly great. We were allowed in,
and received here with furious attacks, but up till now we
have received no books, manuscripts or letters. Evidently
the military censorship is working wonderfully—even with
excessive zeal, since yon know, of course, that we had not
even the slightest mention of the war, and could not have.

Please stop typing the agrarian manuscript, because I
have found one copy here, already set. What is missing in
it is the end, the end of the
“Conclusion”,[1] beginning with
the words:

“The whole of the peasantry and the proletariat are
opposed to the private ownership of the land. The reformative
path of creating a Junker-bourgeois Russia necessarily
presupposes the preservation of the foundations of the old system
of landownership and the slow....”

Now, from these words the end of the Conclusion is missing.

You will oblige me very much if from these words, and to
the end of the Conclusion, you take 4–5 copies and send them
(1) to me personally;
(2) to Pravda, 32 Moika;
(3) to
Stockholm, to the address given to you. I ought to receive at least
one of these copies.

Drop me a postcard, addressed to Pravda, or better still
to M. T. Yelizarov (for V. I.), 48/9 Shirokaya, Flat 24,
    

Petrograd, whether yon have received this letter, and when
yon sent the copies of the end of the Conclusion.

Our journey was wonderful, flatten was not admitted by
Milyukov.

The atmosphere here is a furious campaign of the
bourgeoisie against us. Among the workers and soldiers—sympathy.

Among the Social-Democrats, victory of “revolutionary
defencism” (now, they say, there is something to defend—the
Republic, against Wilhelm). Chkheidze and Co., Steklov
(leaders of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies in
Petrograd) have completely descended into revolutionary
defencism. Chkheidze is in a bloc with Potresov. All are
howling and screaming for “unity” of the whole Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. We, of course, are against.

On April 22, 1917 there will be an All-Russia Conference
of the Bolsheviks (of our Party) in
Petrograd.[2]

Write me whether our “Farewell Letter” has been
published, in what languages and how sales are going.

Write whether you have received the papers (I am
sending you a file of Pravda and cuttings from various papers).
Keep Paris and all Switzerland as well informed as possible.
All the best.

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
What is meant here is the Conclusion to Lenin’s book The Agrarian
Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution,
1905–1907. The book was written in November and December 1907 and
printed in 1908, but while it was still at the print-shop it was
confiscated by the police and destroyed.  

While he was abroad, Lenin decided that when he returned to Russia he
would get the book reprinted. This was done in 1917, but only part of the
Conclusion appeared. The Conclusion was not published in full until 1924,
in the magazine Proletarskaya Revolutsia (No. 5, pp. 166–72),
after the discovery in the Geneva Party archives of Lenin’s manuscript
entitled “The Agrarian Problem during the First Russian Revolution
(Towards a Revision of the Social-Democrats’ Agrarian Programme)”, which
contained the full text of the Conclusion,





[2]
Reference is to the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.), held in Petrograd, April 24–29 (May 7–12), 1917 (see

August 17 (30), 1917

Dear Friends,

With great difficulty, after long weeks of forced
interruption, it seems as though we are successfully resuming our
correspondence. Of course, to make this completely
successful you will have to go to a lot of pains and effort to organise
it at your end.

The shameful campaign of slander launched by the
bourgeoisie about the alleged espionage, or connection
therewith, of Hanecki, Kollontai and many others is, of course,
a scoundrelly cover for the crusade against the
internationalists on the part of our bold “republicans”, who want to
“compare favourably” with tsarism in their slander–
mongering.

(1) I have read somewhere in the Russian papers that
Hanecki and Radek have been publishing a
denial.[4] I don’t
know whether this is true. But it is essential. The first thing
to do is for Radek to write to Paris and get the minutes of
the last Paris trial of himself (by various factions of the
R.S.D.L.P.). Lunacharsky, denouncing these base
slanderers, long ago described this trial in Novaya
Zhizn.[5] But
that is not enough. Someone should try to get the minutes
or at least the full sentence of the court, and, if it cannot be
printed, take several typed copies and send them here. If it
is impossible to gel the minutes or the sentence, it would
be desirable to procure at least a written account of the trial
by one of the Parisians who look part in it, and to publish
at least a small pamphlet in Russian (there is a Russian
printing-press in Christiania), in order to give a documentary

    

refutation of these disgusting slanders. It will be possible
to send us at least some copies of the pamphlet, and extracts
from it should appear in Arbeiterpolitik, Politiken, Demain,
etc.

(2) It is equally essential that Hanecki should give a
documentary refutation of the slanderers, by publishing as rapidly
as possible the financial accounts of his trading and his
“business deals” with Sumenson (who is this lady? It’s the
first time I have heard of her!) and with Kozlovsky (it is
desirable that the accounts should be audited and signed by
a Swedish notary or Swedish socialists, several of them,
members of Parliament). It is also necessary to publish the text
of the telegrams (there has already been something in the
Russian papers, in Russkaya Volya, Bez Lishnikh
Slov[6]
and others, but probably not in full), and to analyse and
explain each.

We must fight against this shameful Dreyfus campaign,
against this slandering, by publishing the pamphlet, and as
quickly as possible, not sparing toil, trouble or money,
in order to brand the slanderers and, as far as possible, to
help those who have been arrested on this base and
slanderous charge.

(3) How are the financial affairs of the Bureau Abroad,
which was appointed by our Central Committee? After the
July persecutions it is clear that our C.C. cannot help (I
think so at any rate). Write whether you have succeeded in
collecting anything through the Swedish Left, and will
the Bureau manage to exist? What about the Bulletin? How
many issues have been published, and in what
languages?[7]
Has Guilbeaux bad all the issues? Have you a file of Demain?
Was the Bulletin sent to America, North and South? Write
about all this in as much detail as yon can.

(4) By the way. I don’t remember who informed us, but it
seems that after Grimm, and independently of him, Moor
appeared in Stockholm. That the scoundrel Grimm, as a
Kautskian “Centrist”, proved capable of a scoundrelly
understanding with “his” minister does not surprise me:
anyone who does not break resolutely with the social–
chauvinists always risks falling into this scoundrelly situation.
But what kind of man is Moor? Has it been fully and
absolutely proved that he is an honest man? That he never had,

    

and has not now, any direct or indirect dealings with
the German social-imperialists? If it is true that Moor
is in Stockholm, and if you know him, I would very, very
much ask you, earnestly ask you, insistently ask you to
lake every step to check this up in the most strict and the
most documented fashion. There is not, or rather, should
not he, any room even for a shadow of suspicion, reproach,
rumour, etc. I very much regret that the “Zimmerwald
Commission” did not condemn Grimm more
severely![8]
It should have been done more severely!

(5) I have been, and remain, unquestionably against
participation in the Stockholm
Conference.[9] I must observe
that I am writing all this letter personally, as from myself,
since I have had no chance either to ask the C.C. or even
communicate with it. Therefore, in replying to me with
particular detail, append to your letter your official,
detailed, business-like, documentary report (of the whole
Bureau) to the Central Committee, and I will send it on.

So, I am absolutely against participating in the Stockholm
Conference. I consider Kamenev’s
statement[10] (have you
seen Novaya Zhizn? you ought to subscribe to it) the height
of stupidity, if not of baseness, and have already written
about this to the Central Committee and for the press.
Luckily Kamenev was speaking only for himself, and was
disavowed by another Bolshevik.

I consider participation in the Stockholm Conference, or
in any other, with the Ministers (and scoundrels) Chernov,
Tsereteli, Skobelev and their parties, to be direct betrayal,
and will state this opinion in the press against all and
sundry. If in the “Zimmerwald Commission” (judging by the
report of the social-chauvinist Rozanov) it proved possible
almost to reject Stockholm, or to half-reject it, this is very
good. But “almost” and “half” are of no use at all, and
all this “half”-social-chauvinist Zimmerwald Commission,
which depends on the Italians and the Ledebourites, who
desire “unity” with the social-chauvinists, is a most harmful
institution.

(6) We are making the very greatest and unforgivable
mistake in delaying or postponing the convening of a
conference of the Left to found a Third International. It is
just now, when Zimmerwald is so shamefully wavering or

    

obliged to be inactive, just now while there still is in Russia
a legal (almost legal) internationalist party with more than
200,000 (240,000)
members[1]

(which does not exist anywhere
else in the world in wartime), it is just now that we are in
duty bound to call a conference of the Left, and we shall
really be criminals if we are late in doing so (the Bolshevik
Party in Russia is being driven more and more underground
day by day).

Money for the conference will be found. It is possible
to issue several numbers of its Bulletin. There is a centre
for it in Stockholm. There is a French “foothold” (Demain)
and an English one (the “Socialist Labour Party” of
America; its delegate
Reinstein[2]

was recently in Petrograd and
will probably be in Stockholm)—though by the way in
addition to the S.L.P. (the “Socialist Labour Party” of
America) there is also an English foothold, Tom Mann in
Britain, the minorities within the British Socialist Party, the
Scottish socialists and The International in America.

It would be simply criminal to postpone now the calling
of a conference of the Left.

It would be immeasurably stupid to “wait” for a “large”
number of participants, and to be “embarrassed” by the fact
that at present there are “few”. For just now such a conference
will be a moral force, independently of the number of
participants, while later it may be hushed up.

The Bolsheviks, the P.S.D., the Dutch, Arbeiterpolitik,
Demain—there is already a sufficient nucleus. They will
certainly be joined, if energetic action is taken, by part of
the Danes (Trier and others, who have left the party of
the scoundrel Stauning), part of the Swedish Young (against
whom we are sinning, in not leading them, because they
must be led), some of the Bulgarians, the Lefts in Austria
(“Franz”[11]), some of the friends of Loriot in France, part
of the Lefts in Switzerland (Youth International) and in
Italy, and then the elements in the Anglo-American
movement which I have already mentioned.
 

The resolutions of the conference of the Bolsheviks
(April 24–29), 1917) and of their congress (July 1917; see the
resolutions in Novaya
Zhizn),[12] the draft new programme
of the same Party—there is a sufficient ideological basis
(adding Vorbote, Tribune, Arbeiterpolitik and others) to be
able to present the whole world with clear answers to the
questions raised by imperialism, and to accuse the
social-chauvinists and the Kautskians.

Such a conference must be called at once, its provisional
Bureau must be set up, and its manifesto and draft
resolutions printed in three languages for passing on to the parties.
I repeat once again: I am profoundly convinced that, if we
do not do this now, we shall make this work terribly
difficult for ourselves in the future, and will terribly facilitate
an “amnesty” for the traitors to socialism.

(7) The ministerialism of the Russian Menshevik-“
Zimmerwaldists” must be specially utilised to put an ultimatum
to Zimmerwald in general: either a break with the Brantings,
Huysmans and Co., or we walk out immediately. By the
way: is Arbeiterpolitik making a campaign against Zetkin
and against the Braunschweiger Volksfreund for the way
these scoundrels, pursuing their intrigues, have been
whitewashing and supporting the Russian Mensheviks, Chkheidze
and Co., who have proved ministerial swine, just like
Sembat, Renaudel, Thomas and Co.?

Has Mehring, too, still not understood to this day the
utter baseness of Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Skobelev and Co.?

(8) You must get your letters sent on here—I hope to
receive immediately just as detailed a letter as mine (
otherwise I do not agree to correspond)—and literature as well:
files from the middle of June, at the very least, of 
Arbeiterpolitik, Demain, Kampf (Duisburg),
Weekly People (S.L.P.),
Leipziger Volkszeitung, Neue Zeit, The Call and others.
Spartacus,
the publications of Loriot and his friends, Avanti!,
etc., etc. As a beginning, you might at least send cuttings.

(9) You should send here, if possible every week, first,
articles for the provincial and Petrograd Party press (
reviews of the Left-wing movement abroad, facts, facts, facts);
secondly, leaflets (4–8--16 small pages) for publication as
booklets. Summaries of facts about the collapse of the
International, the disgrace of the social-chauvinists, the

    

disgrace of the Kautskians, the growth of the movement
of the Left: at least 4 booklets on each of these subjects,
16–32 small pages each. Facts and facts. There is a hope of
publishing this. Reply at once whether you can take it on.
When sending it on by our method (there can be no question
now of sending it legally) I think it is all the same which
language it is written in.

(10) I hope you have the file of Pravda, and are subscribing
to Novaya Zhizn. If you have not received Rabochy i Soldat
(closed down), Proletarskoye Dyelo (Kronstadt) and 
Sotsial-Demokrat (Moscow), write at once, and I will send them as
soon as the new method, being tested for the first time by
this letter, is organised satisfactorily.




P.S. August 18. I have just received Nos. 1, 2, 4 of the
new paper Proletary, the Central
Organ[13]—of course, they
will soon close it down, f will try and send it to you. I am
sending Nos. 1–7.

August 20. I have still not succeeded in sending off my
letter, and probably won’t succeed for some time. So this
is becoming something like a diary instead of a letter! It
can’t be helped. You must have a lot of patience and
determination, if you want to communicate at all with
internationalists in the “most free” imperialist republic. Today I
have learned from Izvestia that News of the Stockholm
Information Bureau of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
is being published weekly in Stockholm. Try to send files
of all Stockholm publications. We see nothing.

August 25 (September 7). It looks as though tomorrow it
will be possible to send this letter. Make every effort to
organise delivery from your end. Reply without fail at
once, if only briefly, to the address (within your country)
which the comrade delivering this letter (or his friend)
communicates to you. He will also pass on a cipher; as an
experiment 1 am writing a few words in this cipher, and
please reply to them in the same
cipher.[3]


P.S. Write one more pamphlet, 16–32 small pages, about
the secret diplomatic treaties of Russia: brief, precise, facts,
facts. Such-and-such a treaty of such-and-such a dale, month,

    

year, content so-and-so. A list of the treaties. A summary.
As brief and factual as possible. Reply whether you
undertake to do it, and when yon will send it.

I conclude: for God’s sake, a conference of the Left
immediately, a bureau of the Left, a bulletin of the bureau, and
decide on a second conference in 2 (1 1/2) months.

Greetings!

Lenin

While Robert Grimm, Chairman of the International Socialist Commission
(I.S.C.), was in Russia in the spring of 1917, he ex changed secret
dispatches with the Swiss statesman Hoffmann concerning the German terms
for conclusion of a separate peace treaty between Germany and Russia. When
this became known, he was expelled from Russia. The investigation of the
case was entrusted to a special commission nominated by the I.S.C., which
declared Grimm’s actions contradictory to the principles of the Zimmerwald
movement. Grimm was removed from his post of Chairman of the I.S.C. and the
commission’s decision on the case was ratified by the Third Zimmerwald
Conference, held in Stockholm in September 1917.

C.E.C. dissociated itself from Kamenev’s speech.

Dear Comrades,

With the greatest happiness I have heard from, my Finnish
friends that yon are at the head of the revolutionary wing
of the Finnish Social-Democratic. Labour Party and are
carrying on a struggle for the cause of the proletarian socialist
revolution. I can state with confidence on behalf of the
revolutionary proletariat of Russia that the great, organising
talent of the Finnish workers, their high level of
development arid their prolonged political schooling in democratic
institutions will help them successfully to effect the
socialist reorganisation of Finland. We count on the fraternal
aid of the revolutionary Social-Democrats of Finland.

Long live the international socialist revolution!

With best greetings,
 N. Lenin

November 11, 1917

People’s Secretarial
 For Commissar Orjonikidze
 Kharkov

I have received your telegram of January 20, 1918. Hearty
thanks for your energetic measures regarding food. Go on
trying for God’s sake as hard as you can to secure foodstuffs,
press on with collection and delivery of grain, so as to
arrange supply before the spring floods. All hopes are on you,
otherwise famine by the spring is inevitable.

I have talked, and will talk, with Pyatakov about
sending money. A hundred millions have been sent, fifty will
be sent to Kharkov. Take measures for triple defence of the
railway line from Petrograd to Kharkov. I am sure that
your relations with the Central Executive Committee in
Kharkov will as before be entirely friendly. Greetings and
best wishes.

It is essential immediately, with demonstrative speed, to
introduce a Bill stating that the penalty for bribery (
extortion, graft, acting as an agent for bribery, and the like)!

shall be 

not less than

ten years’ imprisonment and, in addition, ten years of
compulsory
labour.[2]

[2]
Lenin was prompted to write this letter by an incorrect decision
taken by the Moscow Revolutionary Tribunal, which on May 2,
1918 heard the case against four members of the Moscow
Commission of Investigation charged with bribery and blackmail and passed
a sentence of only six months’ imprisonment. On May 4 Lenin
proposed to the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.) that the judges who had
passed such a lenient sentence should be expelled from the Party.
Acting on the instructions given by Lenin in this letter, the
Council of People’s Commissars adopted a decision obliging the People’s
Commissariat of Justice “immediately” to draw up a Bill
stipulating a “heavy minimum sentence for bribery and any connivance
in bribery”. The Commissariat of Justice’s Bill was discussed by
the C.P.C. on May 8 and amended by Lenin before it finally
became law.

Dear Comrade Shahumyan,

Many thanks for your letter. We are delighted with your
firm and resolute policy. Be capable of combining with it
the most cautious diplomacy, unquestionably required by
the present most difficult, situation—and we shall be
victorious.

The difficulties are immeasurable. So far we are being
saved only by the contradictions and conflicts and struggles
among the imperialists. Be capable of making use of these
conflicts: for the time being we have to learn
diplomacy.[1]

Best greetings and wishes, and greetings to all friends.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The defeat of the anti-Soviet revolt of the Mussavatists at the end
of March 1918 consolidated Soviet power in Baku. A meeting of
the Baku Soviet on April 25 set up the Baku Council of People’s
Commissars, which besides Bolsheviks included some Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Shahumyan was made Chairman of the Baku
Council of People’s Commissars and Commissar for Foreign Affairs.
The Council launched a number of socialist projects. In April and
May 1918 Soviet power was established over a considerable part
of Azerbaijan.

The Azerbaijan workers’ and peasants’ struggle for the victory of
socialist revolution was waged in an extremely complex situation.
The German-Turkish intervention had begun in the Transcaucasus
and Turkish troops had invaded Azerbaijan. On the other hand,
the British Command in Iran had made contact with the Baku
Dashnaks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, in the hope
of using them to take over Baku and overthrow Soviet power in the
city. Lenin therefore instructed the leaders of the Baku Council of
People’s Commissars to be extremely flexible in taking advantage
of the contradictions within the imperialist camp and within the
nationalist parties.

May 23, 1918

Vladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich,
 Office Manager, Council of People’s Commissars

In view of your failure to fulfil my insistent request to
point out to me the justification for raising my salary as
from March 1, 1918, from 500 to 800 rubles a month, and in
view of the obvious illegality of this increase, carried out by
you arbitrarily by agreement with the secretary of the
Council, Nikolai Petrovich Gorbunov, and in direct infringement
of the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of
November 23, 1917, I give you a severe
reprimand.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Lenin refers to the decision of the Council of People’s
Commissars, passed on November 18 (December 1), 1917, “On the
Remuneration of People’s Commissars, Senior Government Employees
and Officials”, =

which he had drafted. It set the maximum monthly
salary for Commissars at 500 rubles with an allowance of 100
rubles for each member of the family unable to work.

Lenin also imposed a severe reprimand on N. P. Gorbunov,
Secretary of the C.P.C.

To be telephoned  to the Smolny,
Petrograd[1]

:



In view of the cutting of the Siberian Railway by the
Czechoslovaks and the tremendous threat to transport, in
view of interrupted communications the very greatest peril
menaces the food supply.

Comrade Vladimirov insists, and I support him, that
Petrograd should urgently send its best food supply personnel
to Moscow. These personnel, together with strong
detachments of selected workers, may save the situation.

Don’t delay. Don’t wait for help from outside. Strain
every effort for extraordinary measures by the Petrograd
workers.

Lenin

June 26, 1918

Also to Lashevich and other members of the C.C.

Comrade Zinoviev,

Only today we have heard at the C.C. that in Petrograd
the workers wanted to reply to the murder of Volodarsky by
mass terror and that you (not you personally, but the
Petrograd Central Committee members, or Petrograd
Committee members) restrained
them.[1]

I protest most emphatically!

We are discrediting ourselves: we threaten mass terror,
even in resolutions of the Soviet of Deputies, yet when it
comes to action we obstruct the revolutionary initiative of
the masses, a quite correct one.

This is im-poss-ible!

The terrorists will consider us old women. This is
wartime above all. We must encourage the energy and mass
character of the terror against the counter-revolutionaries,
and particularly in Petrograd, the example of which is
decisive.

Greetings!

Lenin

P.S. Detachments and still more detachments: make use
of your victory at the elections. If the Petrograders move
10–20 thousand into Tambov Gubernia, the Urals, etc., they
will save both themselves and the whole revolution, 
completely and for certain. The harvest is a giant one, we have to
hang on only a few weeks more.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Volodarsky, V.—a leader of the Petrograd Bolsheviks, editor of
the Petrograd newspaper Krasnaya Gazeta (Red Gazette) and
member of the Presidium of the Petrograd Soviet. He was murdered on
June 20, 1918 by Socialist-Revolutionaries, who in direct collusion
with whiteguards and foreign interventionists adopted terroristic
tactics against the Bolsheviks.

On August 30, M.S. Uritsky, Chairman of the Petrograd
Extraordinary Commission, was murdered by a Socialist-Revolutionary.
The same day a villainous attempt to assassinate Lenin was made
by the Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist Kaplan. Lenin was
gravely wounded by two poisoned bullets.

If you are still disinclined to understand Soviet policy,
which is equally hostile both to the British and to the
Germans, you will have only yourself to blame. Natsarenus
is on his way.

We shall fight the British if they continue their policy of
plunder.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was the last warning to A. M. Yuriev (Alexeyev),
Chairman of the Murmansk Territory Soviet, where the
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had a majority. On March 2,
1918 Yuriev had violated the instructions of the Soviet
Government by entering into negotiations with representatives of the
Entente and concluding a so-called “verbal agreement” with them,
which virtually placed the Territory’s military forces and
economy in the hands of the “Allies” and enabled the imperialists of
Britain, France and the United States to land troops in Murmansk.
   

Despite several warnings from the Soviet Government Yuriev
persisted in his criminal policy. On June 26 he sent Lenin a radio
message demanding further concessions to the interventionists.
Lenin’s reply was the telegram published here.

Natsarenus, S. P. (1883–1938)—Military Commissar
Extraordinary for the Murmansk-White Sea Territory in 1918; later
Military Commissar for the Petrograd Military District. He was also
at various times member of the Revolutionary Military Councils
of the 7th, 14th and 15th armies.

The Council of People’s Commissars has been informed
of quite intolerable behaviour, damaging to Soviet power,
by some requisitioning detachments. The detachments have
been sent for responsible service on the railways, for the
struggle against actual profiteering. Chiefs of detachments
are instructed to maintain the most stringent discipline in
their detachments, for the absence of which, as for all offences
by the detachments, the chiefs will be held to strict account
before the merciless judgement of the Revolutionary
Tribunal. Detachments should be informed that the Council of
People’s Commissars is convinced that class-conscious
workers will not tolerate any breach of the strictest proletarian
discipline, and will treat with the greatest severity those
who by their behaviour are disgracing Soviet power. But if
obvious hooligans have found their way into the detachments,
and refuse to obey the instructions of the central authorities
and their chiefs, or disgrace the Soviet Republic by taking
bribes from grain speculators, they must be immediately
arrested by their chiefs and the local Soviets of Deputies,
and delivered under guard to Moscow for committal to most
severe judgement by the Revolutionary Tribunal.

Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram followed a discussion by the Council of People’s
Commissars on July 1, 1918 concerning a report from V. I. Nevsky,
People’s Commissar for Railways, about protests received from
railwaymen over the illegal activities of certain requisitioning
detachments. Lenin drafted the telegram and submitted it to the
meeting. A typewritten copy with corrections and amendments in
Lenin’s hand has been preserved.

Two bombs were thrown in the German Embassy about
3 p.m. today, severely wounding Mirbach. This is an
obvious act of the monarchists or of those provocateurs who want
to drag Russia into war in the interests of the Anglo-French
capitalists, who have also bribed the Czechoslovaks. Mobilise
all forces, put everyone on guard immediately to catch the
criminals. All cars are to be detained and held for a triple
check.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The German Ambassador Mirbach was assassinated in the
afternoon on July 6 by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries Blyumkin
and Andreyev, who got into the German Embassy with a forged
document for the alleged purpose of negotiating with the
Ambassador and threw a bomb at him. The Left S.R.s hoped by this act
to provoke a war with Germany and be able to overthrow Soviet
power through the combined efforts of all the enemies of the
revolution. The assassination of Mirbach marked the beginning of the
Left S.R. counter-revolutionary revolt in Moscow, July 6 and 7,
1918, which was part of a general onslaught by internal
counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists of the Entente against Soviet
Russia; the rebels were secretly supported by foreign diplomatic
missions.

The revolt occurred during the Fifth All-Russia Congress of
Soviets, which instructed the Government to suppress the revolt
at once. The group of Left S.R. delegates to the Congress was
arrested. Thanks to the vigorous measures taken by the Soviet
Government and the concerted action of Moscow workers and garrison,
the revolt was put down.

the insolence to rise against Soviet power. Detain all cars.

Gubernia, uyezd, volost—Russian administrative-territorial

system of administrative-territorial division in 1929–30.—Ed.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the telegram that J. V. Stalin sent from Tsaritsyn
to Shahumyan on July 20, 1918. In this telegram Stalin condemned
the policy of the Mensheviks, Dashnaks and Socialist–
Revolutionaries in the Baku Soviet, who, on the pretext of defending the
city from the advancing Turkish army, advocated inviting the
“assistance” of British troops. On behalf of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars,
Stalin demanded that the Baku Council of People’s Commissars
should unconditionally implement the decisions of the Fifth
All-Russia Congress of Soviets on an independent foreign policy and
resolute opposition to the agents of foreign capital.

July 26, 1918

Esteemed Comrade Zetkin,

Many warm thanks for your letter of June 27, which was
brought me by Comrade Hertha Hordon. I will do all I can
to help Comrade Hordon.

We are all extremely glad that you. Comrade Mehring
and the other “Spartacus comrades” in Germany are with
us, “head and
heart”.[1] This gives us confidence that the
best elements of the West-European working class—in spite
of all difficulties—will nevertheless come to our assistance.

We here are now living through perhaps the most difficult
weeks of the whole revolution. The class struggle and the
civil war have penetrated deep among the population:
everywhere there is a split in the villages—the poor are for us,
the kulaks are furiously against us. The Entente has bought
the Czechoslovaks, a counter-revolutionary revolt is raging,
the bourgeoisie is making every effort to overthrow us.
Nevertheless, we firmly believe that we shall escape this
“usual” (as in 1794 and 1849) course of the revolution, and
will conquer the bourgeoisie.

With great gratitude, very best greetings and sincere
respect,

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. My wife asks me to give you her special greetings.
To Comrade Hoschka (we have translated his speech, as we

    

have your article) and to all, all friends the very best
greetings.

P.S. I have just been brought our new State Seal. Here is
the impression. The inscription reads: Russian Socialist
Federative Soviet Republic. Workers of all countries,
unite![2]

beginning of the First World War by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa
Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, Julian Marchlewski, Leon
Jogiches (Tyszka) and Wilhelm Pieck. The group carried on
revolutionary propaganda among the masses, organised anti-war
demonstrations, led strikes, and exposed the, imperialist nature of
the war and the treachery of the opportunist Social-Democratic
leaders. In April 1917, the group joined the Centrist Independent
Social-Democratic Party of Germany, while maintaining its
organisational independence. In November 1918, during the revolution
in Germany, the group renamed itself the Spartacus League; on
December 14, 1918 it published its own programme and broke with
the “Independents”. At the Inaugural Congress held from December
30, 1918 to January 1, 1919 the Spartacists founded the Communist
Party of Germany.

July 2 

Astrakhan
 For Shahumyan in Baku

Any actions by the Dashnaks against the decision of the
Fifth Congress of Soviets and the central Soviet power
will be considered insurrection and treason. As regards
sending troops we shall take steps, but cannot promise for
certain.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was Lenin’s reply to a telegram from Baku
reporting the advance of the Turkish troops and the treacherous
activities of the Dashnaks, and also the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who at an extraordinary meeting of the Baku
Soviet on July 25, 1918, in spite of energetic protests by Bolshevik
leaders of Soviet power in the city, had managed to gain an
insignificant majority for a resolution inviting the British to give Baku
military “assistance”.

After the passing of this resolution, the Bolsheviks declared
that they would resign their posts as People’s Commissars. They
continued, however, to light for Soviet power. At an emergency
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Baku Soviet on July 
26, 1918 it was decided that until the question of power was
finally settled all People’s Commissars should remain at their posts.
The All-Baku Conference of Bolsheviks held on July 27 resolved
that emergency measures should be taken to defend Baku under
the leadership of the, C.P.C.; it also resolved to announce general
mobilisation and call upon the workers to defend the city and
Soviet power. The Baku C.P.C. undertook various measures to fulfil
this decision.

In view of the critical food situation, we must not scatter
our forces. We must concentrate them in one place, where
it is possible to secure a lot of grain.

I suggest that forces be concentrated in Yelets Uyezd
where, according to a number of reports and on the evidence
of the People’s Commissar for the Interior Pravdin, who
inspected this area, the state of affairs, in the sense of the
throttling of the kulaks and the organisation of the poor
peasants, is a model one.

Send immediately, with the maximum speed, all the food,
harvesting and harvest-requisitioning detachments to
Yelets Uyezd, with the maximum number of threshers and
attachments (if possible) for rapid drying of the grain,
etc.

Give them the task of clearing the uyezd of grain surpluses
completely.

Probably this will yield several million poods of grain
(in my opinion, more than 6 million poods).

First send the maximum forces to those 12 (out of 21)
volosts of the uyezd where, according to the local people,
the organisation of the poor peasants is best, and
particularly to the former landed estates which have been
registered.

Don’t be niggardly with bonuses for rapid harvesting and
delivery of grain, assign for this purpose up to 30 million
rubles immediately (grant bonuses to volosts and villages
in the shape of machinery, grants for schools and hospitals
and, in general, mainly for such purposes). The maximum

    

bonuses must be given for delivery of all surpluses of grain,
medium bonuses for big deliveries in general, and so forth.
Among the workers of the famine-stricken gubernias (and
among the famine-stricken peasants there also) develop
mass agitation: crusade for grain to Yelets Uyezd!

Anisimov
 Astrakhan

The situation in Baku is still not clear to me.

Who is in power?

Where is Shahumyan?

Inquire of Stalin, and act in the light of all the
circumstances; you know that I have complete confidence in
Shahumyan. The situation cannot be understood from here, and
there is no possibility of giving speedy
help.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On July 31, 1918 external pressure and various internal factors
brought about the temporary collapse of Soviet power in Baku.
On August 1, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and
Dashnaks organised a counter-revolutionary government known as the
Dictatorship of the Central Caspian Area. Agents of the Entente,
they immediately sent their representatives to Iran to fetch the
British, and on August 4 a British force landed in Baku.

In these critical days the Baku Communists were with the
masses, explaining the situation and exposing the treacherous policy
of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Dashnaks; but
the Baku Communists lacked the strength and opportunity to
bring about any fundamental change in the political situation.
On August 12, a Communist conference took the decision to
withdraw temporarily to Astrakhan, taking as many arms and as much
equipment as possible. A group of Communists was appointed to
carry on Party work in Baku.

The plan of evacuation to Astrakhan did not succeed and the
leaders of Soviet power in Baku were arrested.

In the middle of September 1918 the Turkish command launched
an offensive on Baku. The troops of the Dictatorship of the
Central Caspian Area and the British force withdrew, and on the
morning of September 15 Turkish troops and Mussavatists entered
the city. The previous day a group of Communists had managed to
get the Commissars and other Bolsheviks out of prison. They
escaped from the city aboard the steamer Turkmen, but on September 
17 the crew, which had counter-revolutionary leanings, brought the
ship into Krasnovodsk port, where the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
Mensheviks and British interventionists were in command. All
the members of the Baku Council of People’s Commissars and other
Party workers were immediately arrested. On the night of
September 19, 1918, twenty-six leaders of the Baku Commune, who
have since become known in history as the twenty-six Baku
Commissars (S. G. Shahumyan, P. A. Japaridze, M. A. Azizbekov,
I. T. Fioletov, Y. D. Zevin, G. N. Korganov, M. G. Vezirov and
others), were brutally murdered in the Transcaspian desert by the
British interventionists with the direct participation of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks.

August 9, 1918

Comrade Fyodorov,

It is obvious that a whiteguard insurrection is being
prepared in Nizhni. You must strain every effort, appoint three
men will) dictatorial powers (yourself, Markin and one other),
organise immediately mass terror, shoot and deport the hundreds
of prostitutes who are making drunkards of the soldiers,
former officers and the like.

Not a minute of delay.

I can’t understand how Romanov could leave at a time
like this!

I do not know the bearer. His name is Alexei
Nikolayevich Bobrov. He says he worked in Vyborgskaya Storona
District in Petrograd (from 1916).... Previously worked in
Nizhni in 1905.

Judging by his credentials, he can be trusted. Check up on
this and set him to work.

Peters, Chairman of the Extraordinary Commission, says
that they also have reliable people in Nizhni.

You must act with all energy. Mass searches. Execution
for concealing arms. Mass deportation of Mensheviks and
unreliables. Change the guards at warehouses, put in
reliable people.

They say Raskolnikov and Danishevsky are on their way
to see you from Kazan.

Read this letter to the friends and reply by telegraph or
telephone.

Yours,
 Lenin

August 29, 1918

I allow myself to express the following wishes on the
question of fulfilment of the Council of People’s
Commissars’ resolution of August 29, on the submission of
reports within one week:

In the reports, which must be as popular as possible,
it is particularly necessary to note 

(a) improvement in the position of the masses (raising
of wages for the workers, school-teachers, etc.), 

(b) participation of the workers in administration (
personally outstanding workers, workers’ organisations
likewise, etc.), 

(c) participation of the poor peasants and their help to
Soviet power in the struggle against the kulaks, 

(d) expropriation of the landowners, capitalists, traders,
financiers, etc.

The main task is to demonstrate concretely, with facts,
exactly how Soviet power has made definite steps (the first)
towards socialism.

August 29, 1918

Comrade Kedrov,

You are giving us too little factual information. Send
reports with every messenger.

How much fortification work has been done?

Along what line?

At what points on the railway have sappers boon provided,
so that in the event of an advance in force by the
Anglo-French we can blow up and seriously damage such-and-such
a number (how many, there must be a full report, and where
precisely) of bridges, versts of the railway, passages through
the marshes, etc., etc.

Have you taken sufficient measures to safeguard Vologda
against the whiteguard peril? It will be unforgivable if
you display weakness or carelessness in this regard.

Greetings!

Lenin

Thanks. Recovery proceeding
excellently.[1] Am sure
that the crushing of the Kazan Czechs and whiteguards, as
well as of the kulak extortioners supporting them, will
be exemplarily ruthless.

Best greetings.

Copy to Pokrovsky, 53 Ostozhenka, Moscow

I have heard today Vinogradov’s report on the busts
and monuments, and am utterly outraged; nothing has
been done for months; to this day there is not a single bust,
the disappearance of the bust of Radishchev is a farce. There
is no bust of Marx on public display, nothing has been
done in the way of propaganda by putting up inscriptions in
the streets. I reprimand you for this criminal and
lackadaisical attitude, and demand that the names of all
responsible persons should be sent me for prosecution. Shame on the
saboteurs and thoughtless loafers.

I thank you with all my heart for your greetings and

the cause of building socialism. The proletarian mass of
railwaymen and clerks must overcome not only sabotage

it will overcome them.

September 20, 1918

Dear Comrades,

Today’s Pravda has quoted extracts from Kautsky’s
article against Bolshevism (from Sozialistische
Auslandspolitik).[1]

Kautsky’s disgraceful rubbish, childish babble and
shallowest opportunism impel me to ask: why do we do
nothing to fight the theoretical vulgarisation of Marxism
by Kautsky?

Can we tolerate that even such people as Mehring and
Zetkin keep away from Kautsky more “morally” (if one
may put it so) than theoretically.... Kautsky has found
nothing better to do now than to write against the
Bolsheviks, they say.

Is that an argument? Can one really so weaken one’s
own position? Why, that is only putting a weapon into
Kautsky’s hands!!

And this instead of writing:

Kautsky has absolutely failed to understand and has
distorted in a purely opportunist way 

the teaching of Marx on the state

 ” ” ” ” on the dictatorship of the
proletariat

 ” ” ” ” on bourgeois democray

 ” ” ” ” on parliamentarism

 ” ” ” ” on the role and significance
of the Commune, etc.



We ought to take these measures:

(1) have a detailed talk with the Left (Spartacists and
others), stimulating them to make a statement of principle,

    

of theory, in the press, that on the question of dictatorship
Kautsky is producing philistine Bernsteinism, not Marxism;

(2) publish as soon as possible in German my The State
and Revolution;

(3) provide it with at least a publisher’s foreword, as
for example:

“The publisher considers the appearance of this booklet
particularly essential at the present moment, in view of
the complete distortion of Marxism, precisely on these
quest ions, in the latest works of Kautsky, who is replacing
the viewpoint of the dictatorship of the proletariat by
philistine social-liberalism in the spirit of Bernstein and
other opportunists.”

(4) If it is impossible to publish the booklet quickly,
then get a note similar to the “publisher’s foreword” in the
newspapers (of the Left).

I would very much ask you to send (especially addressed
to me) Kautsky’s pamphlet (about the Bolsheviks,
dictatorship, etc.) as soon as it
appears—[2]

—and then to collect for me all Kautsky’s articles about
the Bolsheviks (“Democracy and Dictatorship”, the end
of 1917 or the beginning of 1918; then the article from
Sozialistische Auslandspolitik, August 1918) and other
articles, if there were any.

Very best greetings!

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the article “Karl Kautsky and Henriette
Roland-Holst on the Bolsheviks”, published on September 20, 1918 in
Pravda. The extracts mentioned by Lenin were taken from
Kautsky’s article “Democracy or Dictatorship” in No. 34 of the
magazine Sozialistische Auslandspolitik (Socialist Foreign Policy) for
August 1918. The magazine was the organ of the Kautskians. It
was published in Berlin from 1915 to 1922 (after November 1918,
under the title of Der Sozialist).





[2]
Kautsky’s pamphlet The Dictatorship of the Proletariat was
published in Vienna in the autumn of 1918. It distorted the Marxist
theory of the proletarian revolution and slandered the Soviet state.
Lenin in his book The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade
Kautsky and oilier works of this period castigated the leaders of
the Second International, particularly Kautsky, for their
distortion of Marxist teaching on the socialist revolution and the
dictatorship of the proletariat, and further developed Marxist theory
on these vital questions.

October 1, 1918

Comrades Sverdlov and Trotsky

Things have so “accelerated” in Germany that we must
not fall behind either. But today we are already behind.
We should call tomorrow a joint session of the
    Central Executive Committee
    Moscow Soviet
    District Soviets
    Trade unions, etc., etc.

A number of reports must be made on the beginning of
the revolution in Germany.
    (Victory of our tactics of struggle against
    German imperialism. And so forth.)

A resolution to be adopted.

The international revolution has come so close in one
week that it has to be reckoned with as an event of the next
few days.

No alliances either with the government of Wilhelm, or
with the government of Wilhelm II + Ebert and the other
scoundrels.

But for the German worker masses, the German working
people in their millions, once they have begun with their
spirit of revolt (so far only a spirit), we

are beginning to prepare

a fraternal alliance, bread, military aid.


||| 
We are all ready to die to help the German workers
advance the revolution which has begun in Germany.
 

The conclusion:

(1) ten times more effort to secure grain
(clean out all stocks both for
ourselves and for the German workers).

(2) Ten times more enrolments for the
army. We must have by the spring
an army of three million to help
the international workers’ revolution.

This resolution should go out to the whole world by
cable on Wednesday night.

Appoint the meeting for 2 p.m. on Wednesday. We shall
begin at 4, give me the platform for 1/4 hour of introduction,
I shall drive up and leave immediately afterwards. Send
the car for me tomorrow morning (but by telephone say
only:
agreed).[1]

Greetings!

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The joint meeting of the All-Russia C.E.C., the Moscow Soviet,
the factory committees and the trade unions, proposed by Lenin,
was held on Thursday, October 3, 1918. Lenin, who was
convalescing at Gorki after being wounded, could not attend the meeting,
but sent, a letter that was road out. His main proposals were
included in the resolution passed by the meeting, which on the same
day was officially announced to the world by telegraph.

Samara has been captured. The Volga is free. It would
be criminal not to make use of the few days remaining
before navigation closes. It is essential to strain every
effort to deliver the maximum quantity of oil and food
cargoes to the upper reaches of the Volga. This task cannot
be performed without the strictest centralisation of all
measures, and the precise fulfilment in the localities of
orders from the centre. Taking this into account, the
Council of People’s Commissars resolves, and orders the
fulfilment without fail:

(1) All vessels, rafts, etc., commandeered by various
organisations shall be returned immediately to the Central
Inland Waterways Board and the Central Oil Board
respectively. (This does not apply to the vessels and floating
transport already included in the Volga Military Flotilla.)

(2) The right of requisitioning vessels, rafts, etc., on the
Volga, previously granted to various organisations,
institutions and individuals, is annulled. The requisitioning
of floating moans of transport required for military
purposes shall henceforth take place on each occasion only by
special permission of the Revolutionary Military Council
of the Republic.

(3) All Commanders of Fronts, Extraordinary
Commissions and Soviets shall immediately take the most stringent
measures to ensure the unhindered movement of vessels and
the protection of cargoes against any seizures and delays
whatsoever.
 

(4) The control of the entire Volga tanker fleet and all
oil cargoes on the Volga is vested exclusively in the
Central Oil Board. (Telegraphic address: Glavkoneft, Moscow.)
All authorities, including the military and Front
Commanders, are instructed to carry out without question all
decisions of the Central Oil Board concerning the movement of
oil cargoes, and decisions of the Central Inland Waterways
Board concerning vessels.

(5) The direct control of oil cargoes along the whole
Volga is vested in Comrade Tarvid, member of the
Collegium of the Central Oil Board. All his instructions, and
likewise those of his agents, regarding oil are absolutely
binding on all authorities.

(6) All decisions as to requisitioning or prohibition of
dispatch of oil, etc., published up to this day, remain
in force only insofar as they do not contradict the
instructions of the Central Oil Board.

(7) Most strictly confirming the aforesaid, the Council
of People’s Commissars has decided to prosecute before
military-revolutionary courts all who infringe the present
decision, without regard to their posts or their Party
membership. Agents of the Central Oil Board, the Central Inland
Waterways Board and the Commissariat of food in the
localities are instructed to report to Moscow urgently all
actions by local authorities which interfere with the planned
work of these centres. Extraordinary Commissions will be
dispatched immediately to try the guilty and carry out
the sentences.

(8) The content of the present decision of the Council
of People’s Commissars is to be made known to all local
executive bodies and persons in official positions.

Dear Comrades,

I have received your paper numbered 24962 with an
extract from the resolution of the Presidium of October 7.

In all conscience I must say that this resolution is so
politically illiterate and so stupid that it makes one sick.
“...The Presidium is obliged to disclaim responsibility....”
That is how capricious young ladies behave, not grown-up
politicians. You will not free yourselves of responsibility,
but increase it threefold.

If the Commissariat of Public Education does not reply
to you and does not fulfil its duty towards you, then you are
obliged to complain, and with documents. You are not,
children, are you, that you can’t understand this?

When did you complain? Where is the copy? Where are
the documents and the proofs?

Both the whole Presidium and Vinogradov, in my opinion,
ought to be sent to prison for a week for inactivity.

If the Commissariat of Public Education “does not
produce the busts” (when did you demand them? From
whom? The copy and the document? When did you
complain?), you should have fought for your rights. But “to
disclaim responsibility” is the way of capricious young
ladies and stupid Russian intellectuals.

Forgive this frank expression of my opinion, and accept
communist greetings from one who hopes that you will get
your lesson in prison for inaction in authority, and from
one who is profoundly indignant at your behaviour.

Lenin

Lenin was prompted to write this letter by the decision of the
Presidium of the Moscow Soviet of October 7, 1918, in which the
loaders of the Soviet attempted to avoid responsibility for not
carrying out the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars on
setting up in Moscow monuments to outstanding figures in the
revolutionary movement and the world of culture.

October 18, 1918

Dear Comrades,

We have had news today that the Spartacus group,
together with the Bremen Left
Radicals,[2] has taken the
most energetic steps to promote the setting up of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Councils throughout Germany. I take this
opportunity to send our best wishes to the German
revolutionary internationalist Social-Democrats. The work of the
German Spartacus group, which has carried on systematic
revolutionary propaganda in the most difficult conditions,
has really saved the honour of German socialism and the
German proletariat. Now the decisive hour is at hand: the
rapidly maturing German revolution calls on the Spartacus
group to play the most important role, and we all firmly
hope that before long the German socialist proletarian
republic will inflict a decisive blow on world imperialism.

I hope that the book by the renegade Kautsky against
the dictatorship of the proletariat will also bring certain
benefits. It will prove the correctness of what the Spartacus
group always said against the Kautskians, and the masses
will the more quickly be freed from the corrupting
influence of Mr. Kautsky and Co.

With best greetings and firm hopes that in the very
near future it will be possible to hail the victory of the
proletarian revolution in Germany.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

portent of a new era, the era of victorious socialism, which
is now opening up both for Germany and for the whole world.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian
Communist Party (Bolsheviks),

   Committee

A radio message has just been received from Kiel,
addressed to the international proletariat and stating that
power in Germany has passed into the hands of the workers
and soldiers.

This radio message is signed by the Council of Sailors’
Deputies of Kiel.

In addition, German soldiers at the front have arrested
a peace delegation from Wilhelm, and have themselves
begun negotiations for peace direct with the French soldiers.

Wilhelm has abdicated.

It is essential to make every effort to communicate this
as soon as possible to the German soldiers in the Ukraine,
and to advise them to attack the troops of Krasnov, because
then we shall together win tens of millions of poods of grain
for the German workers, and beat off an invasion by the
British, whose squadron is now approaching Novorossiisk.

Telegraph receipt and fulfilment.

Ivanov, Chairman of the Unecha R.C.P.
 Unecha

I thank everyone for the greetings. Am particularly
touched by the greetings from the revolutionary soldiers of
Germany. It is now extremely important that the
revolutionary soldiers of Germany should take an immediate
and active part in liberating the Ukraine. First of all,
the whiteguards and the Ukrainian authorities must be
arrested and, secondly, delegates from the revolutionary
troops of Germany must be sent to all German military units
in the Ukraine, so that they may take rapid and common
action to liberate the Ukraine. There is no time to lose.
Not an hour must be wasted. Telegraph immediately
whether the revolutionary soldiers of Germany are
accepting this proposal.

Deputies, together with the Unecha organisation of the R.C.P.(B.),

I have just received from Unecha greetings from the
revolutionary soldiers of Germany. I consider it extremely
important that you should inform all posts on the
Ukrainian border of this by telegraph and, replying on my behalf
with gratitude for the greetings of the revolutionary soldiers
of Germany, you should appeal to them to help by rapid
and resolute action in the liberation of the Ukraine. Let
the revolutionary soldiers of Germany complete the
glorious German revolution they have begun by arresting
the whiteguards in the Ukraine and liberating it.

Long live the revolutionary soldiers of Germany in the
Ukraine!

Long live the fraternal alliance between the German
Soviet Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Republic!

Commander-in-Chief Vatsetis
 Serpukhov

The Defence Council inquires:

(1) Is it true that during the battles in the Balashov
area about two weeks ago our units in the course of two
or three days surrendered 25–30 guns to the enemy and,
if this is true, what have you done to bring those guilty
to trial and to avert similar happenings?

(2) Is it true that a fortnight ago you gave an order for
the capture of Orenburg and, if it is true, why is the order
not being carried out?

(3) What has been done to stabilise the position of our
units in the Perm area who are demanding urgent help
from the Centre?

The Defence Council awaits a reply from you to these
questions.

According to information received, notwithstanding the
decree of November 21, local co-operatives are being
nationalised and closed, their goods requisitioned and no help is
being given in restoring their legitimate
activity.[1] All
this causes dislocation of supply and upsets the
organisation of the Soviet Republic’s rear. The present is an
instruction immediately to cease attempts to infringe and evade
the decree of November 21, to restore the closed and
nationalised co-operatives, to return their goods, and without
fail to include the co-operatives in the distributive system,
on an equal footing with state shops. The co-operative
machinery should be made use of in all possible ways in
the business of purchasing supplies and distribution, and
representatives of the co-operative movement should be
drawn into co-operative commissions of the food supply
organisations. Infringement and evasion of the decree will
be punished. This telegram is to be communicated for
information and action to all Executive Committees and
food supply organisations of the Northern Region. To be
published in the local newspapers.

Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Defence Council
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The decree “On Organisation of Supply”, passed by the Council of
People’s Commissars on November 21, 1918, provided for
development of the co-operative movement and the revival of
nationalised and municipalised co-operative shops and stores. The decree
made it incumbent on the Poor Peasants’ Committees and the
local Soviets to establish systematic supervision of the work of
the co-operatives in order to prevent any attempts that might be
made by kulaks and other counter-revolutionary elements to
dominate them.

 Kursk (or present whereabouts)

The operations report of the Chief of Staff of the
Caucasus Front No. 4873 shows that the Krasnov troops have
occupied Raigorod, on the banks of the Volga south of
Sarepta, threatening in the first place our military freight
moving from Vladimirovka to Tsaritsyn, and secondly
the safety of the line from Astrakhan to Saratov. Please
take steps. The same operations report shows that a British
fleet of four vessels bombarded Staroterechnaya, south of
Astrakhan, set fire to two of our barges and withdrew to sea
unscathed, seizing our hospital ship Alesker with medical
staff on board. Where is our fleet and what is it doing?

Sokolnikov

I am extremely worried by the slowing down of
operations against the Donets coalfields and Rostov. There must
be a speed-up but, of course, only with substantial forces.
Work out practical directives for this purpose, and we shall
get them adopted by the Central Committee for the
Ukrainians, and equally for our own people. It is a crying
scandal that the suppression of the Cossack rising is dragging
on.[1] Reply in as much detail as you can.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the whiteguard Cossack rising on the Don, in the
Veshenskaya area, in the rear of the Southern Front. In a number
of directives to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic
and the Command of the Southern Front Lenin drew attention to
the danger of the rebels’ linking up with Denikin’s advancing
troops, and the need to crush the rebellion with all speed (see
this volume, pp. 378, 384, 387 and 388).

 Copies to Podvoisky and Rakovsky

Sokolnikov cables me that Denikin has magnificently
taken advantage of the interlude in the Donets coalfields,
fortified himself and gathered fresher forces than ours. The
peril is a tremendous one. The Ukraine is hound to
recognise the Donets Basin Front as unquestionably the most
important Ukrainian front, and at all costs to begin
immediately carrying out the directive of the
Commander-in-Chief to provide solid reinforcements for the sector
Donets-Mariupol. From Podvoisky’s information I see that
there is a mass of war materiel in the Ukraine, even without
counting Odessa. It should not be hoarded, and both Donets
workers and new units should be formed to take Taganrog and
Rostov. Have you mobilised all the officers in the Ukraine?
At all costs the forces against Denikin must be rapidly
and considerably increased. Cable in as much detail as
possible, and make your cipher clerks do their ciphering
more carefully, so that everything can be understood.

secondly—cannot the mouth of the Ural and Guriev

With the loss of Vilna the Entente has become still more
insolent. It is essential to develop the maximum speed
in regaining Vilna in the shortest possible time, so as not
to give the Whites the opportunity of bringing up their
forces and consolidating. Speed up the reinforcements which
are on the way and act as energetically as you can. The
Field Staff is to increase its supervision of the operation in
this direction in every possible way.

Donets coalfields, the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) and Lenin
repeatedly instructed the commanders of the Ukrainian Front and
the Ukrainian Soviet Government to assist the Southern Front.
But some of the military leaders of the Ukraine (N. I. Podvoisky,
V. A. Antonov-Ovseyenko and others), prompted by narrow, local
interests, held up the transfer of troops to the Donets sector.
Antonov-Ovseyenko, Commander of the Ukrainian Front, demanded
that the lines of demarcation between the Ukrainian Front and the
Southern Front in the Donets Basin should be revised, and that the
bulk of the forces operating in this area should be placed under his
command, and refused to recognise the major importance of the
Donets sector, claiming that the Ukrainian Front was confronted
by more important tasks in the Western and Southern Ukraine.
Lenin rejected his proposal.

Comrade Bukharin,

Print this with a circumstantial and calm analysis,
demonstrating in detail that such waverings of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries in the direction of the kulak and of
separation from Russia, i.e., of fragmentation of our forces in
face of Kolchak and Denikin, objectively lead to helping
the bourgeoisie and
Kolchak.[1]

Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the highly nationalistic resolution passed by the
Ekaterinoslav organisation of the Ukrainian Socialist–
Revolutionaries, who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, the policy
of the Soviet Government, and the political, economic and
military alliance between the Ukraine and Soviet Russia.

I express my very deepest gratitude and appreciation
to the comrades of the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army for the
tank sent as a
present.[1]

This gift is dear to all of us, dear to the workers and
peasants of Russia, as evidence of the heroism of their
Ukrainian brothers, and is dear also because it bears witness to
the complete collapse of the Entente which seemed so strong.

Best greetings and the warmest good wishes for success
to the workers and peasants of the Ukraine and the
Ukrainian Red Army.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Defence Council
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The war trophies captured by the Red Army on the Southern Front
included several French tanks. The Command of the 2nd Ukrainian
Soviet Army sent one of them to Lenin as a gift, accompanying it
with a loiter of welcome.

Up till now there has not been a single precise factual
reply from you as to what units have been moved into the
Donets Basin, how many rifles, sabres, guns, at what
station the advanced trains are. The capture of Lugansk proves
that those who accuse you of leaning to independence and
turning your eyes to Rumania are right. Understand that
you will be responsible for a disaster if you are late with
serious help to the Donets Basin.

mass desertion to our side, are not exaggerated? If you do,
what steps have you taken, first, to accelerate the offensive

Zinoviev, Defence Committee, Petrograd

With the object of ascertaining the situation in Petrograd,
the Defence Council requests you to give an exhaustive
reply: on what considerations was it decided to evacuate
several factories from Petrograd and the neighbourhood, by
whom and why was an instruction given to sink ships, the
total numbers of workers mobilised and remaining in the
factories, are all those who have been mobilised really being
used for defence requirements, for what reasons were
Commissars appointed to the slate factories, was there an
indiscriminate call-up of citizens or was the decision of the central
authority observed. The Defence Council, while leaving in
force for the time being the slate of siege in Petrograd, notifies
you that measures taken by the Petrograd Defence
Committee must be applied with the knowledge of, and in
appropriate cases by agreement with, the central
authority.[2]

Lenin
 Chairman, Defence Council
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At the beginning of May 1919, the threat of an offensive by White
Finnish troops made it necessary to mobilise the working people
of Petrograd in defence of the city. Some of the Petrograd leaders,
however, including G. Y. Zinoviev, Chairman of the city’s
Defence Committee, underestimated the strength and ability of the
defenders. In a mood of panic they decided without informing the
Defence Council, to evacuate several factories, and were
preparing to scuttle the Baltic Fleet. Workers were mobilised
haphazardly with the result that many factories of great defence importance
had to slow down. The telegram sent by Lenin was on behalf of
the Defence Council. The draft of it was signed by L. B. Krasin
and A. I. Rykov.





[2]
The Defence Council look direct control over the organisation of
the defence of Petrograd. On May 17, 1919 it decided not to
announce and not to carry out any general evacuation of Petrograd or
the Petrograd area, but to set up a special commission with powers
to state what should be moved out of the city, and how this should
be done.

The offensive against Petrograd multiplies tenfold the
peril, and the extreme necessity of suppressing the revolt
immediately, at all costs. Telegraph how things are going—
has the division which was landed got to work at last, are
the Voronezh and Tambov Communists who were sent you
arriving, do you need more reinforcements, and of what

Delays are extraordinarily dangerous.

I repeat my request I hat you telegraph me twice a week
about your actual help to the Donets Basin. I insist on
the fulfilment of this request. Don’t lose a moment of
your victory over Grigoryev, don’t release a single soldier
who has been fighting
Grigoryev.[1] Decree and put into
effect the complete disarmament of the population, shoot
on the spot without mercy for every concealed rifle. The
whole problem of the moment is a rapid victory in the
Donets Basin, the collection of all rifles from the villages, the
creation of a stable army. Concentrate all forces on this
task, don’t relax your energies, mobilise the workers en 
masse. Read this telegram to all prominent Bolsheviks.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Reference is to the counter-revolutionary “ataman” Grigoryev, who
in May 1919 had started an insurrection in the rear of the Red Army
in the Southern Ukraine (Elizavetgrad, Ekaterinoslav, Krivoi Rog
and Kherson area). The insurrection was crushed at the end of
May 1919.

 to be issued through

Lashevich, Yurenev, Gusev, Rozengolts,
 Smirnov, Muralov

Revolutionary Military Council, Eastern Front

Serious worsening of the situation near Petrograd and
the break-through in the South oblige us again and again
to take troops from your front. We cannot do otherwise.
You must go over to more revolutionary forms of military
work, cutting through the usual methods. Mobilise in the
front-line area everyone between 18 and 45 en masse, give
them the task of capturing the nearest big works like
Motovilikha, Minyar, promising to let them go when they have
captured these places, assigning two or three men per
rifle, calling on them to drive Kolchak out of the Urals.
Mobilise 75 per cent of members of the Party and the trade
unions. There is no other way out, you must go over to
revolutionary methods. Discuss in part with Kamenev how
to carry this out, and reply what you are undertaking.

(1) Without fail at once appoint (and carry through to
the end) an investigation into who misinformed yon, 
minimising the
disaster.[1]

After all, this is treachery.

(2) All measures must be taken and special attention
given to the rapid movement of the 6 regiments from the
Eastern Front.

For really it is you, Comrade Sklyansky, who have proved
to be responsible for the
delay!![2]

Reply to me what exactly you have done on both points.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Reference is to the critical situation in Petrograd.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin refers to the criminal delay in fulfilling his instructions on
the urgent dispatch of reinforcements to the Petrograd Front.

Gusev, Lashevich

We have to take the division in view of the bad and
almost catastrophic situation near Petrograd and in the
South. No help for it. We shall hope that, in view of the
capture of Ufa, the 5th Army will be able to give up the
division without yielding the Belaya River, and that by
doubling and redoubling our Party energy we shall together
cope with the problem of not letting things go as far as
defeat on the Eastern Front.

Lashevich, Yurenev
 Revolutionary Military Council Eastern Front
 Simbirsk

There are reports, first, of a considerable decrease in
the number of political workers in the armies of the
Eastern Front, because they are leaving for local
administrative work in the areas liberated from the enemy; and,
secondly, of the fatigue of some divisions. The most serious
attention must be given to this. Political workers and all
others, whoever they may be, should be absolutely forbidden
to leave the army before the Urals have been occupied, and
before they have been replaced by double the number of
Urals workers; and then at all costs you should secure
mobilisation en masse in the front-line area and replace the
tired units by fresh forces, if only for a temporary rest,
because the offensive against the Urals must not be weakened,
it must definitely be intensified, speeded up, strengthened
with reinforcements. Telegraph what measure you are
taking. Pay attention to the rising near Samara and on the
Irgiz.[1] Your silence about this is suspicious.

Lenin
 Chairman, Defence Council
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
During the decisive offensive actions of the Southern Group of the
Forces of the Eastern Front against Kolchak, White Cossack and
kulak risings occurred in a number of front-line areas (Samara and
Orenburg gubernias, and the Urals Region).

achieved. It is extremely necessary to mobilise,
immediately and to a man, the workers of the Urals factories that
are being liberated. New revolutionary methods must be
found for at once incorporating these workers in the army,
in order to provide a rest for those who are tired and to
transfer troops for the South. Inform the regiments of the

Lashevich, Yurenev
 Revolutionary Military Council, Eastern Front
 Simbirsk

Congratulations on your
victories.[1]

Special measures should be taken: first, to prevent the
Urals workers from pilfering arms, so that they don’t get
involved in harmful guerrilla warfare and, secondly, to
prevent the Siberian partisan spirit from demoralising our
troops.

Telegraph your opinion, also inform me whether you are
working well with the new Commander of the Front, and in
more detail about Bashkir
affairs.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the following decisive victories over the whiteguard
forces in the struggle for the liberation of the Urals: the capture
of the town of Zlatoust by the 5th Army (July 13, 1919) and the
capture of the town of Ekaterinburg (now Sverdlovsk) by the 2nd 
Army on July 14, 1919.

The new Commander of the Forces of the Eastern Front
appointed on July 13, 1919 was Mikhail Frunze.





[2]
Lenin refers to Krzhizhanovsky’s article “Zadachi elektrifikatsii
promyshlennosti” (“Tasks of the Electrification of Industry”), a
condensed version of which was published in Pravda No. 20 on
January 30, 1920.

July 31, 1919

Dear Alexei Maximych,

The more I read over your letter, and the more I think
of the connection between its conclusions and what it sets
forth (and what yon described at our meetings), the more
I arrive at the conviction that the letter, and your
conclusions, and all your impressions, are quite sick.

Petrograd has been one of the sickest places in recent
times. This is quite understandable, since its population
has suffered most of all, the workers have given up more
of their best forces than anyone else, the food shortage is
grave, and the military danger too. Obviously your nerves
can’t stand it. That is not surprising. Yet you won’t listen
when you are told that you ought to change your abode,
because to let oneself flog I he nerves to a slate of sickness is
very unwise, unwise even from the plain common-sense point
of view, not to speak of other points of view.

Just as in your conversations, there is in your letter a sum
of sick impressions, leading you to sick conclusions.

You begin with dysentery and cholera, and immediately
a kind of sick resentment comes over you: “fraternity,
equality”. Unconscious, but the result is something like
communism being responsible for the privations, poverty
and diseases of a besieged city!!

Then follow some bitter witticisms, which I don’t
understand, against “hoarding” literature (which? why connected
with Kalinin?). And the conclusion that a “wretched

    

remainder of the intelligent workers” say that they have
been “betrayed” into “captivity to the muzhik”.

That, now, has no sense in it at all. Is it Kalinin who
is being accused of betraying the workers to the muzhik?
That is what it amounts to.

This might be invented by workers who are either quite
green, stupid, with a “Left” phrase instead of a brain,
or else by those who are overwrought, exhausted, hungry,
sick, or else by the “remainder of the aristocracy” who have
a splendid ability to distort everything, a splendid gift
for picking on every trifle to vent their frenzied hatred
of Soviet power. You yourself mention this remainder
at the same point in your letter. Their state of mind is
having an unhealthy influence on you.

You write that you see “people of the most varied
sections of society”. It’s one thing to see them, another thing
to feel daily contact with them, in all aspects of one’s life.
What you mainly experience is from the “remainder”—if only
by virtue of your profession, which obliges you to “receive”
dozens of embittered bourgeois intellectuals, and also by
virtue of your general circumstances.

As though the “remainder” cherish “something bordering
on sympathy for Soviet power”, while “the majority of the
workers” produce thieves, “Communists” who have jumped
on the band-waggon, etc.! And you talk yourself into the
“conclusion” that a revolution cannot be made with the
help of thieves, cannot be made without the intelligentsia.

This is a completely sick psychology, acutely aggravated
in the environment of embittered bourgeois intellectuals.

Everything is being done to draw the intelligentsia (the
non-whiteguard intelligentsia) into the struggle against the
thieves. And month by month the Soviet Republic acquires
a growing percentage of bourgeois intellectuals who are
sincerely helping the workers and peasants, not merely
grumbling and spitting fury. This cannot be “seen” in
Petrograd, because Petrograd is a city with an
exceptionally huge number of bourgeois people (and “
intelligentsia”) who have lost their place in life (and their heads),
but for all Russia this is an unquestionable fact.

In Petrograd, or from Petrograd, one can only become
convinced of this if one is exceptionally well informed

    

politically and has a specially wide political experience.
This you haven’t got. And you are engaged, not in politics
and not in observing the work of political construction, but
in a particular profession, which surrounds you with
embittered bourgeois intellectuals, who have understood
nothing, forgotten nothing, learned nothing and at best—a
very rare best—have lost their bearings, are in despair,
moaning, repeating old prejudices, have been frightened
to death or are frightening themselves to death.

If you want to observe, you must observe from below,
where it is possible to survey the work of building a new
life, in a workers’ settlement in the provinces or in the
countryside. There one does not have to make a political
summing-up of extremely complex data, there one need only
observe. Instead of this, you have put yourself in the
position of a professional editor of translations, etc., a
position in which it is impossible to observe the new building
of a new life, a position in which all your strength is
frittered away on the sick grumbling of a sick intelligentsia,
on observing the “former”
capital[1]

in conditions of
desperate military peril and fierce privations.

You have put yourself in a position in which you cannot
directly observe the new features in the life of the workers
and peasants, i.e., nine-tenths of the population of Russia;
in which you are compelled to observe the fragments of life
of a former capital, from where the flower of the workers
has gone to the fronts and to the countryside, and where
there remain a disproportionately large number of
intellectuals without a place in life and without jobs, who specially
“besiege” you. Counsels to go away you stubbornly reject.

Quite understandably, you have reduced yourself to a
condition of sickness: you write that you find life not only
hard, but also “extremely revolting”!!! I should say so!
At such a time to chain oneself to the sickest of places as
an editor of translated literature (the most suitable
occupation for observing people, for an artist!). As an artist,
you cannot see and study anything there that is new—in
the army, in the countryside, in the factory. You have

    

deprived yourself of any opportunity of doing what would
satisfy the artist: in Petrograd a politician can work, but
you arc not a politician. Today it’s windows being broken for
no reason at all, tomorrow it’s shots and screams from prison,
then snatches of oratory by the most weary of the
non-workers who have remained in Petrograd, then millions
of impressions from the intelligentsia, the intelligentsia of
a capital which is no longer a capital, then hundreds of
complaints from those who have been wronged, inability
to see any building of the new life in the time you have
left after editing (the building goes on in a particular way,
and least of all in Petrograd)—how could you fail to reduce
yourself to a point when it is extremely revolting to go on
living?

The country is living in a feverish struggle against the
bourgeoisie of the whole world, which is taking a frenzied
revenge for its overthrow. Naturally. For the first Soviet
Republic, the first blows from everywhere. Naturally. Here
one must live either as an active politician or (if one’s
heart does not draw one to politics), as an artist, observe
how people are building life anew somewhere that is not,
as the capital is, the centre of furious attack, of a furious
struggle against conspiracies, of the furious anger of the
capital’s intelligentsia—somewhere in the countryside, or
in a provincial factory (or at the front). There it is easy,
merely by observing, to distinguish the decomposition of
the old from the first shoots of the new.

Life has become revolting, the “divergence” from
communism “is deepening”. Where the divergence lies, it is
impossible to tell. Not a shadow of an indication of a
divergence in politics or in ideas. There is a divergence of mood—
between people who are engaged in politics or are absorbed
in a struggle of the most furious kind, and the mood of
a man who has artificially driven himself into a situation
where he can’t observe the new life, while his impressions
of the decay of a vast bourgeois capital are gelling the
better of him.

I have expressed my thoughts to you frankly on the
subject of your letter. From my conversations (with you)
I have long been approaching the same ideas, but your
letter gave shape and conclusion, it rounded off the sum

    

total of the impressions I have gained from these
conversations. I don’t want to thrust my advice on you, but I cannot
help saying: change your circumstances radically, your
environment, your abode, your occupation—otherwise life may
disgust you for good.


All the best.

Yours,
 Lenin

Comrade Sklyansky,

I am not well, I have had to go to bed.

Therefore reply by messenger.

The delaying of the offensive in the Voronezh direction
(from August 1 to 10!!!) is monstrous. The successes of
Denikin are enormous.

What’s wrong? Sokolnikov said that there (on the
approaches to Voronezh) our forces were four to one.

So what is wrong? How could we miss the boat in this
way?

Tell the Commander-in-Chief that this won’t do. Serious
attention is required.

Should I not send the following telegram to the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front (copy
to Smilga):

In code

To be late with the offensive is quite intolerable,
because this delay will yield the whole Ukraine to Denikin
and will ruin us. You answer for every day and even hour
that the offensive is held up unnecessarily. Inform us at
once of your explanations, and the date when at last you
will begin a resolute offensive.

Lenin
 Chairman, Defence Council

Secret. Take 2 copies, and send one to Comrade 
Sklyansky with this note:

Comrade Sklyansky,

It is clear from this that they are trying to shift
responsibility. Probably there isn’t a single battle-worthy unit
against Mamontov: this is an absolute disgrace, and
complete negligence on the part of the Revolutionary Military
Council, or complete failure to use an opportunity.

As energetic measures as possible must be taken!

Lenin

To Sklyansky. See to it yourself that all this is kept secret.




Addition: The railway people say that our units that
have been sent against Mamontov are afraid to leave their
trucks.

By sending such units, the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic disgraces itself.

Bashkir Revolutionary Committee
 Ufa
 Copy to Comrade Validov

Now that the decisive victories of the Red Army in the
East have assured the free development of the Bashkir
people, the decision of the Revolutionary Military Council
of the Republic to transfer some Bashkir units to Petrograd
acquires exceptional political importance. The predatory
imperialists will see that the awakened peoples of the
East have risen to defend the centres of the proletarian
revolution. At the same time close contact between the armed
Bashkirs and the workers of Petrograd will ensure close
ties and mutual respect in the spirit of communism. I
express my profound conviction that the Revolutionary
Committee of the Bashkir Republic, and all advanced
Bashkir comrades, will make every effort to ensure that
the transfer of the Bashkir units takes place in the shortest
possible time and with the least possible burdening of the
railways. Please transmit fraternal greetings to the Bashkir
Red Army men.

Comrade Gusev,

Thinking over the letter from Sklyansky (about the
situation on September 15) and the sum total of the operations
reports, I am becoming convinced that our Revolutionary
Military Council of the Republic is working badly.

To keep on with reassuring reports is bad tactics. It
becomes “a game of reassurance”.

But in reality, we have stagnation, almost collapse.

At the Siberian Front they have put some blackguard
Olderogge and the old woman Pozern in charge, and “
reassured themselves”. An absolute disgrace! And now we are
beginning to get beaten! We shall make the R.M.C.R.
responsible for this, if energetic steps are not taken! To let
victory slip out of our hands is a disgrace.

Inaction against Mamontov. Evidently, there has been
one delay after another. The troops marching on Voronezh
from the North were late. We were late in transferring the
21st Division to the South. We were late with the armoured
cars. Late with communications. Whether it was the
Commander-in-Chief alone who visited Orel, or whether he went
with you, is all one: the job was not done. Communications
with Selivachov were not established, supervision of him
was not established, in spite of the long-standing and direct
demand of the Central Committee.

As a result, inaction against Mamontov and inaction
with Selivachov (instead of the “victories” promised from
day to day in childish little drawings—do you remember

    

how you showed me these little drawings, and how I said:
they’ve forgotten the enemy?!).

If Selivachov deserts, or his divisional commanders
betray us, the guilty party will be the R.M.C.R., because
it slept, and sent us soothing messages, but didn’t do its
job. We must send the best, most energetic commissars to
the South, not sleepy owls.

We arc late, too, with new formations. We are letting
the autumn go by—and Denikin will triple his forces, get
tanks, etc., etc. This can’t go on. The sleepy tempo of
work must be made into a lively one.

Reply (through Lydia Alexandrovna Fotiyeva).

Lenin

September 16

Apparently our R.M.C.R. “gives orders”, without being
interested in or able to follow up fulfilment. This may be
our common vice, but in military affairs it simply means
destruction.

Comrade Sklyansky,

Cavalry radio stations, and also light mobile field
stations, of which there are large quantities in the stores of
the Central Military Engineers’ Board, are absolutely
essential for the Southern Front. Give immediate
instructions for the urgent transfer to the Southern Front of 50
of each type. This is demanded by Stalin, who complains
very much of lack of communications.

Write me what exactly you have done, and incidentally
order for me from the C.M.E.B. a brief summary of the total
number of radio stations they possess, and their distribution
among the forces.

In the opinion both of Unshlikht and of Stalin, Sergo
is a most reliable military worker. That he is a most loyal
and most practical revolutionary, I know from my own
experience of over 10 years.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written on a letter from G. K. Orjonikidze (Sergo) of
October 15, 1919, reporting disorder and criminal lack of
discipline in the armies of the Southern Front.

Orjonikidze had written: “Something unbelievable, something
bordering on treachery. A light-minded attitude to the work, an
absolute failure to understand the seriousness of the situation. Not
a sign of order at any of the headquarters. Front H.Q. is a riot....
Where is this order and discipline, where is Comrade Trotsky’s
regular army?! How could he have allowed such a collapse? This
is beyond all bounds.”

October 20, 1919

Comrades Kaminsky, Oskin and Mezhlauk
 Tula

Comrades,

Tula is just, now of exceptional importance—and
generally speaking, even independently of the enemy
being close at hand, Tula is of vast importance to the
Republic.

Therefore you must exert all your energy to achieve
co-ordinated work, concentrating everything on military
affairs and military supplies.

I regret very much the friction between yourselves and
Zelikman on one side and Peters (he is an important and
extremely dedicated person) on the other, and I think that
this is Zelikman’s fault because, if some unevenness was
noticeable, it should have been immediately put right
(and this was not difficult to do), without letting matters
reach a conflict. The slightest unevenness must in future
be settled, reporting to the centre in time, not allowing
it to develop into a conflict.

Every effort must be made to improve the work in Tula;
it must be placed entirely on a war footing. A decree
reducing the civil administration will be published in a few
days. Not only must it be observed; it must be applied
with supreme conscientiousness and
zeal.[1] In Tula the
masses are far from being on our side. Hence the necessity
for particularly intensive work among the troops, among
the reservists, among the working men and women.
 

If you are short of personnel, write: we shall send you
help from Moscow.

Check up on the defence work unremittingly. Are strong
points being put up? Is the work weakening? Are there
enough materials, and workers? Are the Red Army men
being trained? Are supplies for them in order? All these and
similar questions must be assigned for special 
supervision to practical people and comrades devoted to the
Party. You hear full responsibility for the success of this
work and for any negligence (if you do not complain in
lime and do not appeal to the centre). The formation of
army units is of exceptional importance.

If we  take
Orel,[2] the effort should not be reduced,
but multiplied tenfold, since without this we shall not
conquer, and an interruption in the offensive means death
for us.

Read this letter to all responsible workers and Party
members and regularly, very briefly, keep me informed of
what in fact is being done.

With communist greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the transfer of certain Rod Army units to labour
service at the beginning of 1920, so that, they could ho used for
purposes of reconstruction. The war with bourgeois-landowner
Poland and Wrangel forced the Government to return the labour
armies to the fighting line.

Orel was liberated by Soviet troops on October 20, 1919, the day
Lenin wrote this letter.

October 24, 1919

Comrade V. V. Vorovsky
 State Publishing House

Having looked through the pamphlet Third International,
March 6–7, 1919, brought out by the State Publishing House,
Moscow, 1919 (price 8 rubles), 99 pages, I impose a severe
reprimand for such a publication, and demand that all
members of the collegium of the State Publishing House
should read my present letter, and should work out serious
measures to guarantee that such an outrage is not repeated.

The pamphlet is a horrible piece of work. A slovenly
mess. No table of contents. Some idiot or sloven, evidently
an illiterate, has lumped together, as though he were drunk,
all the “material”, little articles, speeches, and printed
them out of sequence.

No preface, no minutes, no exact text of the decisions,
no separation of decisions from speeches, articles, notes,
nothing at all! An unheard-of disgrace!

A great historic event has been disgraced by such a
pamphlet.

I demand:

(1) Correction by pasting in. (The guilty persons to
be sent to prison and obliged to paste in the additions in
every copy.)

That I should be informed:

(2a) How many copies were printed?

(2b) How many have been sold?

(3) Reprinting in a decent form. Proofs to be shown to me.
 

(4) Establishment of a rule that one definite person should
be responsible for each publication (a register of responsible
persons to be started).

(5) Other measures for introducing order; they are to
be worked out and sent to me.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Zinoviev,

(1) It is said that the combustible slate near Veimarn
is not deep down. If two or three sazhens of earth are removed,
an excavator can be used to break up the slate and
extract it.

We must make an effort; mobilise the bourgeoisie for
this (they can live in dug-outs for the time being); work
three shifts of eight hours; rouse the Petrograd workers
for this job; 

mobilise the peasants (four hours a day for two weeks,
as a beginning and so on).

(2) It is said that Zhuk (the one who was killed) was
making sugar out of sawdust?

Is that true? If it is true, you absolutely must find his
assistants, in order to continue the job. The importance is
tremendous.

Greetings!

Lenin

Gleb Maximilianych,

I was very interested in your report on peat.

Wouldn’t you write an article about it in 
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn (and then republish as a pamphlet, or in some
journal)?[1]

The question must be discussed in the press.

Here, you should say, are reserves of peat—milliards.

Its heat efficiency.

Its location—near Moscow; Moscow Region.

Near Petrograd—as exactly as possible.

Easy to secure (in comparison with coal, combustible
slate, etc.).

Use of the labour of the local workers and peasants (even
if only four hours a day for a start).

Here, you say, is the basis for electrification, increasing
output so many times by using existing power stations.

Here is the most rapid and most certain basis for the
restoration of industry—

—organisation of labour in socialist fashion (
agriculture + industry);

—a way out of the fuel crisis (we shall release so many
millions of cubic metres of timber for transport).

Put in the conclusions of your report; add a peat map;
brief and general calculations. The possibility of building
peal machines quickly, etc., etc. Briefly, the essence of
the economic programme.
 

The question must be brought up immediately in the
press.

Yours,
 Lenin

December 26

P.S. In case of necessity, get Winter on the job, but provide
the article as soon as you can.

To Litvinov from Lenin

It is extremely important for us to have all the documents,
resolutions, pamphlets, newspaper articles and speeches
dealing with the ideological trends in Left-wing socialism
and communism, especially anarcho-syndicalist distortions
of communism or attacks on communism. Collect all this
carefully in all languages, make clippings, send, or bring,
them in three or four copies, especially the German “
Independents”, their congress and after their
congress,[1] and
the German Communists.

Lenin

V. I. Lenin.
 1920

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers to the Independent Social-Democratic Party of
Germany, a Centrist party founded in April 1917. The party held an
emergency congress in Leipzig from November 30 to December 6,
1919, at which under pressure from Left-wing members of the
Party a programme of action recognising the idea of the dictatorship
of the proletariat and the system of Soviets was adopted. The
party’s proletarian wing also proposed “immediate and unconditional
joining of the Third International”. In October 1920 at the
Independent Social-Democratic Party’s congress in Halle a split
occurred, and in December 1920 a large section of the party joined the
Communist Party of Germany. The Right-wing elements formed a
separate party, retaining the old title Independent Social–
Democratic Party of Germany; this party existed until 1922.

January 16, 1920

To Comrade Tomsky, with a request to bring this before
   the All-Russia C.C.T.U.
   and the Communist group in the All-Russia C.C.T.U.

Dear Comrades,

I send yon herewith a report on the astonishing red tape,
carelessness, bureaucracy and helplessness displayed in
a most important practical matter.

I have never doubted that there is still very much
bureaucracy in our Commissariats, in all of them.

But I did not expect that there would he no less
bureaucracy in the trade unions.

This is the greatest disgrace. I very much ask you to
read all these documents in the Communist group of the
All-Russia C.C.T.U., and to work out practical measures
for combating bureaucracy, red tape, idleness and
helplessness.

Please be good enough to let me know the results.

Melnichansky himself rang me up about these 10,000
metalworkers. I made a fuss at the People’s Commissariat
of Railways, and now Comrade Melnichansky has let me
down....

With communist greetings,
V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At the end of 1919, Lenin gave instructions that 10,000 qualified
metalworkers should be sent to repair the railways. The leaders of
the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the Moscow
City Council of Trade Unions were slow in arranging; the transfer
of metalworkers to the Moscow railway system, and the delay
prompted Lenin to write this letter.

January 18, 1920

Comrade Lunacharsky,

Recently I had occasion—to my regret and shame,
for the first time—to look through the famous Dahl
dictionary.[1]

It’s a magnificent thing, hut then it’s a dictionary of
regional terms, and out of date. Is it not time to produce
a dictionary of the real Russian language, a dictionary,
say, of words used nowadays and by the classics, from
Pushkin to Gorky?

What if 30 scholars were set to work at this, and provided
with Red Army rations?

What would be your attitude to this idea?

A dictionary of the classical Russian language?

Without making a noise about it, have a talk with people
who know the subject, if it’s not too much trouble, and
let me know your opinion.

Yours,
 Lenin

In accordance with Lenin’s instructions, the People’s
Commissariat of Education began work on compiling a new dictionary,
but the project was not realised at that time. A new Tolkovy slovar
russkogo yazyka (Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian
Language) came out in 1935–40 in four volumes under the editorship of
D. N. Ushakov.

Gleb Maximilianovich,

I have received and read the
article.[1]

Magnificent.

We need several such articles. Then we shall publish
them as a
pamphlet.[2] What we lack is specialists with
a wide horizon and “an eye for the future”.

It is necessary
(1) for the time being to cut out the
footnotes or reduce them. There are too many of them for a
newspaper (I will have a talk with the editor tomorrow).

(2) Would it not be possible to add a plan, not a technical
one (this, of course, is a job for many people, and not to
be done in a hurry), but a political or state plan, i.e., a
task for the proletariat?

Approximately as follows: in 10 (5?) years let us build
20–30 (30–50?) power stations, in order to cover the whole
country with a network of centres of 400 (or 200, if we can’t
manage more) versts radius; using peat, water,
combustible slate, coal, oil (for example, make a survey of the whole
of Russia, giving rough approximations). Let’s begin at
once buying the necessary machines and models, you say.
In 10 (20?) years we’ll make Russia “electrical”.

I think you could produce such a “plan”—I repeat, not
a technical one but a state one—a draft plan.

It must be provided right away, in a visual, popular
form, for the masses, so as to carry them forward with a
clear and vivid perspective (entirely scientific at its
foundations); let’s set to work, and in 10–20 years we shall make
all Russia, both industrial and agricultural, electrical. We

    

shall set ourselves the target of having so many (thousands
or millions of horse-power or kilowatts?? devil knows
what) mechanical slaves and so on.

Could there also be a tentative map of Russia with centres
and their areas? Or is that not yet possible?

I repeat, we must carry away the mass of workers and
politically-conscious peasants with a great programme for
the next 10–20 years.

Let’s have a talk on the telephone.

Yours,
 Lenin

January 23

P.S. Krasin says that electrification of the railways is
impossible for us. Is that true? And if it is, perhaps it
will be possible in 5–10 years? Maybe it is possible in the
Urals?

Could not a special article be written about a “state
plan” for a network of power stations, with a map, or with
the approximate list (number) of them, with the prospects
of centralising the power of the whole country?

Ring me up on the telephone, please, when you get this
letter, and we shall have a talk.
 

Notes

Mikhail Alexandrovich,

Comrade Nikolayev has given me your letter and told
me the essence of the thing. I made inquiries of
Dzerzhinsky, and immediately sent off both the telegrams far which
you asked.

I take this opportunity of expressing to yon my deep
gratitude and sympathy for the great work of radio inventions
which you are carrying on. The newspaper without paper
and “without distances” which you are bringing into being
will be a great achievement. I promise to assist you in any
and every possible way in this and similar work.

With best wishes,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

All in code
 February 27, 1920

Trotsky

Of course, the Defence Council will not object to the
disbanding of the army clerical
staff.[1] All the symptoms
are that Poland will present us with absolutely
unreasonable, even arrogant terms. All attention must be directed
to preparing, strengthening the Western Front. I should
think extraordinary measures essential for rapid
transportation of everything possible to the Western Front from
Siberia and from the Urals. I am afraid we have been in
a little too much of a hurry with the labour
armies,[2]
if we don’t use them entirely to accelerate deliveries to
the Western Front. We have to give out the watchword
of being ready for war with Poland.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his telegram of February 26, 1920 Trotsky wrote that it would
be inexpedient to maintain the whole clerical staff of the 3rd Army,
which had been transferred to labour service. The army had only
one infantry and one cavalry division. The telegram further

   

stated that the Field H. Q. had given its assent to the disbanding of
the army clerical staffs and requested the opinion of the Defence
Council. Lenin marked the telegram “Report to the Defence
Council”.





[2]
Lenin refers to the transfer of certain Rod Army units to labour
service at the beginning of 1920, so that, they could ho used for
purposes of reconstruction. The war with bourgeois-landowner
Poland and Wrangel forced the Government to return the labour
armies to the fighting line.

I am very glad of your report that you expect the
complete defeat of Denikin soon, but I am afraid of your
excessive optimism. The Poles evidently are going to make
war with them inevitable. Therefore the main problem now
is not the Caucasus Labour Army, but preparations for the
speediest possible transfer of the maximum troops to the
Western Front. Concentrate all your efforts on this
problem. Make use of prisoners most energetically for the same
purpose.

March 14

Gleb Maximilianovich,

After looking through the statement by the
GOELRO[1]
and thinking over yesterday’s talk, I have come to the
conclusion that it is dry.

It is not enough.

Can’t you write, or commission an article from Krug
(or someone else) of such a kind as to
prove 

or, at any rate, illustrate 

a) the tremendous advantage, 

b) the necessity of electrification.


For example:

I. Transport. To restore in the old way—

we need a millions (at pre-war prices)

or a fuel + β working days.

But to restore it on the basis of electrification

a minus x million rubles

a minus y fuel +

(β minus z) working days.

Or also

α

—,

α + β

but with an effect so many times greater
than the  previous one.

II. Steam power. If industry is restored in the old way,
we must spend more than for restoring it on the basis of
electrification.

III. Agriculture.

To restore, say, + 5 million ploughs and teams of
horses.
 

The cost of doing this in the old way, and with
electrification?

This is a rough idea. I think an intelligent specialist
will do this work in a couple of days (if he wants to do it
conscientiously), taking either the Figures of pre-war
statistics (a few, really a few, summary figures), or a rough
and approximate calculation “(as a first
approximation”[2]
towards a first approximation).

Commission this. Perhaps yon will commission somebody
to collect the material for you and write the article yourself
or give an interview. I will send an interviewer. Then we
shall have the warp for propaganda. And that is important.

After reading this, ring me up on the telephone.

Yours,
 Lenin

March 15, 1920

Comrade Sklyansky,

A decision of the R.M.C. is required:

to turn particular attention to the mistake that has
obviously been made with the Crimea (sufficient forces
were not moved in
time)[1];

—all efforts should be exerted to correct the mistake
(events in
Germany[2] render extremely acute the question
of hastening Denikin’s final defeat);

—in particular, prepare naval equipment (mines,
submarines, etc.) and a possible advance from Taman into
the Crimea (I seem to remember that Mikhail Dmitriyevich
Bonch-Bruyevich told me this would be easy).

A number of most precise and most energetic decisions
by the R.M.C. on this are essential immediately.

Send me a copy.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The task of taking the Crimea, where the remnants of Denikin’s
defeated army under the command of General Y. A. Slashchov
had taken refuge, was given to the 13th Army of the South–
Western Front. In January 1920, only the 46th Division of this army
engaged Slashchov’s forces, but it was unable to break through
into the Crimea. Fresh attempts to take the Crimea in February
and the first half of March 1920 wore also unsuccessful.





[2]
Reference is to the events in Germany following the so-called “Kapp
putsch”. On March 13, 1920 Berlin was seized by counter–
revolutionary officers of the Reichswehr, who aimed at restoring the
monarchy and establishing a terroristic military dictatorship. The
German working class replied to this attempted counter–
revolutionary coup with a general strike, which spread all over the
country. The putsch was defeated.

It is extremely, extremely necessary for us to take Baku.
Devote all your efforts to this, and in your statements
you must be particularly diplomatic and make maximum
sure that a firm local Soviet authority is ready. The same
applies to Georgia, though I advise you to be even more
careful there. Come to an understanding with the
Commander-in-Chief about transfer of troops.

I have passed on to Comrade Khodorovsky a request to
help you as regards rations, wood fuel, etc.

He has promised to do this.

Write to me when someone is coming this way (bettor
through the military) 

(1) has anything been done to help you? in rations?
in fuel?

(2) do you need anything more?

(3) can you collect material for the history of the Civil
War

and the history of the Soviet Republic?


Can you collect any of this material in Kazan? Can I be

Please write to me, and give your address.

Best greetings.

May 5, 1920

Comrade Pokrovsky,

Some time ago it happened that I talked with Comrade
Lunacharsky about the necessity of publishing a good
dictionary of the Russian
language.[1]

Not like Dahl, but a
dictionary for use (and study) by all, a dictionary, so to
speak, of the classical, contemporary Russian language
(for example, from Pushkin to Gorky, perhaps). Provide
about 30 scholars, or as many as are needed, with rations,
taking, of course, those who are not suitable for any other
work—and let them do the job.

Lunacharsky said that he had been thinking about this
already, and that it was either being done or would be
done.

Be so kind as to find out whether it is being done, and
drop me a line.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

My sister has just told me of the terrible misfortune
which has overtaken you. Allow me to give you the very
warmest handshake, and to wish you courage and firmness
of spirit. I very much regret that I have not been able to
fulfil my desire to see you more often and to become better
acquainted. But your books, and what my sister has often
told me, have aroused a profound affection for you in me,
and I very much want to say to you bow necessary your
work is for the workers and for all of us, and how essential
it is now for you to be firm, in order to overcome your
grief and force yourself to return to work. Forgive me for
writing in a hurry. Once again, I shake you very warmly
by the hand.

Yours,
 Lenin

Theses should also be written for the Second Congress
of the Third International on the international economic
and political situation.

Could not Radek, or Lapinsky, who has more time, or
someone else, whom they would advise, be given the job of
making a preliminary draft of these theses, approximately
on the following
lines[1]:

(1) The division of the whole world (both in the sense
of the spheres of influence of banking and finance capital,
and in the sense of international syndicates and cartels,
and equally in the sense of the seizure of colonies and
semi-colonies) is the basic fact of imperialism, of the
economy of the twentieth century.

(2) Hence imperialist wars are inevitable in general,
and particularly the first imperialist war of 1914–18.

(3) Results of this war:

(a) reduction in the number of states that are
world powers, increase in the number of weak,
dependent states which are being plundered and divided;

(b) the tremendous sharpening of all capitalist
contradictions, both within all the capitalist
countries and among the countries themselves;

(c) in particular, the sharpening, on a world scale,
of both poles of capitalism: 

increase of luxury among a tiny number of
capitalist magnates;

increase of need, poverty, ruin, famine,
unemployment, extreme insecurity of existence;
 

(d) intensification of militarism, more intense and
accelerated preparation for new imperialist wars,
economically inevitable; a growth in the number
of wars throughout the world, particularly of
revolutionary wars;

(e) complete bankruptcy of the League of Nations,
exposure of its falseness; the collapse of “Wilsonism”.
The bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy.

(4) Explanation, in the briefest way, by characterising
(cf. the report by P. Levi, April 14,
1920[2]):

Britain and America
 France
 Japan
 the other, neutral countries of Europe and America
 the defeated countries (principally Russia and
Germany)
 the colonies^
 the semi-colonies (Persia, Turkey, China).

(5) Raw material—its exhaustion
 industry—its weakening (fuel, etc.)
 currencies—their collapse. Debts. Devaluation.
 “Dislocation”, break-up of the whole system of world
economy.

(6) The result == a world revolutionary crisis. The
communist movement and Soviet power.
 

Notes

The plan of theses expounded in this letter formed the basis of
Lenin’s report, on the international situation and the fundamental
tasks of the Communist International which he made at the
Second Congress of the Comintern, held in Moscow from July 19 to
August 7, 1920 (see present edition. Vol. 31, pp. 215–34).

To Comrade Chicherin

My proposal:

1) Directives to be given to Kopp through the People’s
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs in the spirit of Comrade
Chicherin’s proposal (only trade negotiations).

2) Gukovsky to be answered.

3) Curzon to be replied to in two days (not earlier;
why spoil them), after asking Kamenev and the Consul
once again: why haven’t we received the original in
English?

The reply to be extra polite on the following lines 

if Britain (+ France + ? + ?) wants a general, i.e.,
a real peace, we have long been for it.
In that case remove
Wrangel, since he is your man, kept by you, and then we
begin negotiations at once.

If Poland wants peace, we are for; we’ve said it clearly
and we repeat it, let her make an offer.

If you interrupt trade negotiations, we are very sorry,
but you expose yourselves as departing from the truth,
because you began these negotiations during Poland’s war
and promised an armistice. Calmly and precisely expose
their contradictions.

The draft reply to be approved by telephone through
the members of the Political Bureau on Friday or Saturday,
July 23 or 24.

Lenin
 

Comrade Chicherin,

If you agree, inform Comrade Krestinsky (he agrees in
principle), then draft the reply.

Yours,
 Lenin

September 15, 1920

To the Chief Board of Management of the Coal Mines
  of Eastern Siberia
  For the workers in the mines and also
  for their technical personnel

Dear Comrades,

I thank you with all my heart for your greetings of
August 2, 1920, transmitted through Comrade Ivan
Yakovlevich Ilyin. My talk with Comrade Ilyin about the energetic
work being done in the Siberian mines and his report of
the gradual growth of conscious discipline among the
workers (who are now working not for the capitalists but
for themselves) gave me tremendous pleasure.

Particularly precious in your greetings, comrades, was
the feeling of the deepest conviction in the final and
complete victory of Soviet power over the landowners,
capitalists and all kinds of exploiters, and also your unswerving
firmness and determination to overcome all obstacles and
difficulties. It is from this firmness of the working class
and toiling masses that, like every other Communist,
I draw my confidence in the inevitable world victory of
the workers and the workers’ cause.

With communist greetings, and wishes for your speediest
success,

Devotedly yours,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Frunze, R.M.C., Southern

Having received the exultant telegrams from Gusev and

at all costs you must enter the Crimea on the heels of the
enemy. Prepare as carefully as possible, and check whether
all the fords for taking the
Crimea[2] have been studied.

Dear Comrades,

As you have set it forth, I am in agreement with you,
but if you want to make use of my opinion against your
“opposition”, give them both your letter to me and my
reply.[1] Then they will be informed, and will be in a
position to give me their version:
and then I will not be informed
one-sidedly.

On the substance of the matter, this briefly is my view.
Until we have completely beaten Wrangel, until we have
captured the entire Crimea, military tasks come first. That
is absolutely unquestionable.

Furthermore, for Tula, in view of its armaments and
ammunition works, it may very well be that for a certain
time even after victory over Wrangel it will still be a task
of first priority to go through with producing rifles and
ammunition, because the Army must be made ready by the spring.

Excuse my brevity, and please inform me whether you
have shown the “opposition” this letter of mine and your
letter to me.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter addressed to Lenin certain members of the Presidium
of the Tula Gubernia Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) asked for his
advice on “which of the two positions in the situation at present
experienced by Soviet Russia is correct—the position giving
priority to peaceful construction, or the other position giving
priority to the necessity of straining every effort to solve our
military problems”. =

The authors of the letter expressed misgivings
that shoving priority to economic and educational (asks, as
certain members of the Tula Party organisation wore trying to do,
would weaken effort and discipline at the Tula munitions
factories.

Dear Comrades,

In my opinion, to provide scientists with an extra room
for a study, and for a laboratory, in Petrograd (a city
exceptionally well off as regards apartments) is really and
truly no sin. You should even have taken the initiative
yourselves.

I strongly request you to get this thing moving and,
if you disagree with me, to be kind enough to drop me a
few words immediately, so that I see where the obstacle is.

With communist greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

This letter was written in response to Maxim Gorky’s appeal to the
All-Russia Commission for Improving Scientists’ Living Conditions,

   

in which he mentioned certain cases when scientific workers had
been obliged to share too large a part of their flats with new tenants.
Gorky was then chairman of the Petrograd branch of the
Commission.

 Copy to the Southern Front

Wrangel is obviously withdrawing his forces. Possibly
he is already trying to take refuge in the Crimea. To let
him give you the slip would be the greatest crime. The
success of the impending blow depends to a considerable
degree on the 1st Cavalry Army. We request the R.M.C.
of the 1st Cavalry Army to adopt the most heroic measures
to accelerate the concentration of this Army.

November 2, 1920

Comrade Klasson,

I fear that you—excuse my frankness—will not be up to
making use of the decision of the Council of People’s
Commissars on
Hydropeat.[2] I fear this because you,
evidently, have spent too much time on “senseless dreams”
about the restoration of capitalism, and have not been
sufficiently attentive to the extremely specific features
of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism.
But I say this not in order to reproach you, and not only
because I remembered the theoretical arguments I had
with you in 1894–95, but with a narrowly practical object.

In order to make proper use of the decision of the C.P.C.
you must 

1) complain with ruthless strictness and in good time
of any breaches of this decision, checking up very closely
on its fulfilment and, of course, selecting for complaint
only those cases which come under the rule, “few but to
the point”;

2) from time to time—again following the same rule—
write to me (N.B. mark the envelope: PERSONAL, from
so-and-so, on such-and-such a question): 

please send a reminder or inquiry
 such-and-such (draft text on a separate sheet)
 to such-and-such a person or institution, on such–
and-such a question, in view of the recognition of the
works undertaken by Hydropeat as being of state
importance.
 

If you don’t let me down, i.e., if your reminders and
inquiries are strictly business-like (without departmental
squabbles or polemics), I will sign such reminders and
inquiries in two minutes, and they will sometimes be of
practical value.

Wishing you rapid and great success with your invention.

Greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Klasson, R. E. (1868–1926)—Soviet power engineer. He designed
and directed the construction of a number of power stations in
Moscow, Petrograd and in the Baku oilfields, and also the world’s
first peat-fuelled power station. He was one of the inventors of
the hydraulic method of extracting peat.

Lenin refers to the decision “On the Hydraulic Method of Extracting
Peat”, passed by the Council of People’s Commissars on October

November 6

G. M.,

This is a very important thing. Our
Commission[2]
(to which surely you have been invited? by the previous
decision?) will meet tomorrow (or November 8 in the
morning).

The (attached) draft of the subcommission must be
attentively discussed beforehand.

GOELRO[1]

has not been included at all!

In my opinion this is not right: what is any “plan” worth
(or any “planning commission” or “planning programme”)
without a plan of electrification? It is worth nothing.

Strictly speaking, it is GOELRO which should be the
single planning organ of the Council of People’s Commissars;
but so simply and brutally this will not be accepted, and
it would be wrong. We must think over (urgently, before
tomorrow) how the question should be put.

Perhaps
(1) the chairman of GOELRO should be given
a consultative vote in the economic department of the
Narrow Council of People’s
Commissars[3]?

(2) GOELRO should be made a standing commission of
the C.P.C., since it prepares and carries out, or should
carry out, electrification for the Supreme Economic
Council, for the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture,
for the People’s Commissariat of Railways, etc.
 

(3) All planning commissions of all People’s
Commissariats should be linked and co-ordinated with GOELRO.
But how?

By selling up yet one more commission attached to
GOELRO, composed of the chairmen of all the separate
planning commissions? Or how otherwise?

Ring me up when you have read this.

And return me the minutes (of the subcommission of
November 5) today, not later than 10 p.m.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

[2]
Reference is to the meeting of the preliminary conference on
organisation of contact between all People’s Commissariats concerned
with the economy. The preliminary conference was set up by the
Council of People’s Commissars on October 26, 1920; its chairman
was Lenin.





[3]
Narrow Council of People’s Commissars was organised in
December 1917. It had the rights of a commission of the Council of
People’s Commissars and its task was to relieve the Council of
minor affairs. Its decisions, which had to be unanimous, were
signed by V. I. Lenin and acquired the force of decisions of the
Council of People’s Commissars. If a difference of opinion arose the
matter was placed before the Council of People’s Commissars.

G. M.,

The following idea has come into my head.

There must be propaganda for electricity. How? Not,
only in words but by example.

What does this mean? The most important thing is to
make it popular. For this we have, here and now, to work
out a plan for lighting up every house in the R.S.F.S.R.
by electricity.

This is a long-term affair, because neither 20,000,000
(-40,000,000?) bulbs, nor wire, etc., shall we have for a
long time.

But all the same a plan is needed now, if only to cover
a number of years.

That comes first.

And secondly, we must work out right away a shorter
plan, and then thirdly—and this is most important—we
must be able to arouse both competition and initiative among
the masses, so that they set about the job straightaway.

Would it not be possible for this purpose immediately
to work out such a plan (for example):

(1) All volosts (10–15 thousand) to be supplied with
electric lighting in one year.

(2) All settlements (1 1/2 million, probably not more than
3/4 million) in two years.

(3) Priority for^the reading-room and the Soviet (two
light bulbs).

(4) Get the poles ready at once in such-and-such a way.

(5) Prepare the insulators at once yourselves (ceramics

    

works, I believe, are local and small affairs?). Make them
in such-and-such a way.

(6) Copper for the wires? Collect it yourselves in your
uyezd and volosts (a gentle hint at church bells, etc.).

(7) Organise (raining; in electricity in such-and-such
a way.

Could not something of this kind be considered, worked
out and decreed?

Yours,
 Lenin

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky

Would it not he possible to develop (not at once, but
straightaway after the
Congress,[2] for the Council of Labour
and Defence) a practical plan for an electrification
campaign:


Etwas[1]

:



(1) in each uyezd urgently to set up at least one power
station;

(2) make it obligatory for this centre to become a 
training, lecture, demonstration, etc., centre, and
take the entire
population through these courses (beginning with the young
people, or by volosts, etc.);

(3) immediately assign tasks among the population as
to what they can now make a start on (we need 2 1/2 million
poods of copper—so let us at once assign tasks for
bringing in 25million poods, let people voluntarily begin to
collect church bells, door handles, etc.; then poles, etc.);

(4) begin preparatory navvying work at once, assigning
tasks among the uyezds;

(5) mobilise all engineers, electricians, all who have
done courses at physico-mathematical faculties, etc., without
exception. Their obligation will be to deliver not less than
two (four?) lectures a week, to teach not less than (10–50?)
people about electricity. If they fulfil this—a bonus. If
they don’t—gaol.
 

(6) Write urgently a few popular pamphlets (some to
be translated from Germ an) and adapt the “book” (yours)
into a number of more popular articles, for teaching in
the schools and reading to the peasants.

And then a number of detailed measures on the
following two groups:

aa) propaganda and training 

bb) first steps towards pulling this into practice at once,
and from all angles.

Lenin

Bakury Volost Organisation of the R.C.P.,
 Bakury Volost, Serdobsk Uyezd, Saratov Gubernia
 Copy to the Saratov Gubernia Party Committee
   and the Gubernia Executive Committee

Dear Comrades,

The secretary of your organisation, Comrade Turunen,
has informed me in writing that, at the request of the
peasants, you have passed a decision to bring to my
knowledge through him the counter-revolutionary activities
of certain food-supply workers in your volost who are
ill-treating poor peasants, robbing them for personal
gain, encouraging illicit distilling, getting drunk, raping
women, provoking attacks on Soviet power, etc. You
ask me to take steps from here in Moscow to put an end
to these counter-revolutionary actions. But to fight on the
spot, with all your strength against counter-revolution
is one of the most important tasks of local Party
organisations, including yours. Your bounden duty is, by getting
into touch with the Uyezd Party Committee, and—if that
does not help—with the Gubernia Party Committee, to
secure the arrest and prosecution before the Revolutionary
Tribunal of counter-revolutionaries and scoundrels like
those about whom you are reporting.

What have you done in this direction?

In the second part of his letter, Comrade Turunen sets
out your view that Soviet power, in order to overcome
economic break-down, must for some time lean on the

    

peasantry as it would on a crutch. This is quite true. This
has been said in our Party Programme, and in the
resolutions of Party Congresses. At the last, Eighth All-Russia
Congress of Soviets, the question of reviving agriculture
was considered in detail and very carefully, and the
Congress adopted important practical decisions, which you
will have to apply on the spot, as directed by the Gubernia
authorities.

These decisions have been published in the newspapers.
In addition, Comrade Turunen will bring you some
supplementary material which he will have received at the People’s
Commissariat of Agriculture, where he was sent on my
recommendation.

With communist greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Gorbunov,

This Bonch-Bruyevich (no relation, only has the same
surname as V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich) is by all accounts a
very outstanding inventor. The matter is of immense
importance (a newspaper without paper and without wires,
for with a loudspeaker and with the receiver which
Bonch-Bruyevich has developed in such a way that it will be easy
for us to produce hundreds of receivers, all Russia will
be able to hear a newspaper read in Moscow).

I particularly ask you:

(1) to follow up this matter specially, calling in
Ostryakov and telephoning Nizhni, 

(2) to get the attached draft decree speedily through
the Narrow Council. If unanimity cannot be reached quickly,
be sure to prepare it for the Full Council of People’s
Commissars for Tuesday, 

(3) to inform me twice a month on the progress of the
work.[1]

Lenin

January 26
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter was written on a memorandum which P. A. Ostryakov,
construction chief of the first radio-telephone station in Moscow,
sent to Lenin on January 26, 1921. Ostryakov reported that he
was encountering difficulties and asked Lenin to help remove them
and endorse the decree Ostryakov had drafted.

On January 27, 1921 the C.P.C. passed a decree on organising
full-scale radio-telephone construction. It instructed the People’s
Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs to build stations for
two-way radio-telephone communication in Moscow and other centres.


Bonch-Bruyevich, M. A. (1888–1940)—outstanding Soviet radio
engineer. In 1916–19 he did research on electronic valves. In 1918
ho took charge of the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory.

February 6, 1921

Comrade Sklyansky,

I attach one more “warning”.

Our military command has failed disgracefully by
allowing Makhno to get away (in spite of an immense
superiority of forces and strict orders to catch him), and is now
failing still more disgracefully by proving unable to crush
a handful of bandits.

Order a brief report for me from the Commander-in-Chief
(with a brief sketch showing the disposition of bands and
troops) about what is being done.

How is the wholly reliable cavalry being used?

—the armoured trains? (Arc they rationally
distributed? Are they not moving wastefully, requisitioning
grain?)

—armoured cars?

—aeroplanes?

How, and how many are in use?

Both grain and wood fuel, everything is being lost because
of the bands, while we have a million-strong army. You must
do all you can to brace up the Commander-in-Chief.

Lenin

Secret

G. M.,

Look at this and note it. Return it at once secretly.

Milyutin is writing nonsense about the
plan.[1] The
greatest danger is that the work of planning the stale
economy may be bureaucratised.

This danger is a great one. Milyutin does not see it.

I am very much afraid that with your different approach
to the question you do not see it either.

We are beggars. Hungry, ruined beggars.

A complete, integrated, real plan for us at present—
“a bureaucratic utopia”.

Don’t chase it.

At once, without delaying a day or an hour, bit by bit
single out the most important, the minimum number of
enterprises, and put them on their feet.

Let’s talk about this personally before your report.
Think it over.

Lenin

February 25

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky,

On the question of the General Planning
Commission.[1]

(1) On its composition in general we shall come to an
agreement after your arrival. This will not be difficult.

(2) The Central Committee has decided to leave in Larin
for the time being. The danger from him is a very great
one, because it is in his character to disorganise any work,
seize power, overthrow all chairmen, drive specialists away,
speak (without a shadow of right to do so) in the name “of
the Party”, etc.

On you falls the heavy task of subordinating,
disciplining, moderating Larin. Remember: directly he “begins”
to go beyond limits, rush to me (or send me a letter).
Otherwise Larin will upset the whole General Planning
Commission.

(3) You have to set up within the General Planning
Commission a super-firm presidium (it must be without
Larin), so that organisers and strong people (capable of
giving a complete rebuff to Larin, and steadily going ahead
with this difficult work) should help you and relieve you
of administrative work (it was pointed out at the Central
Committee that you are, strictly speaking, not an
administrator). The Presidium, perhaps, could consist of two of
your assistants, one secretary, and so forth. You must be
the “leading spirit” of the work and the ideological guide
(in particular, kick out, get rid of tactless Communists
who may drive out the specialists).... Your task is to catch,
select, put on the job capable organisers, administrators

    


|||| N.B. 

(like Osadchy, etc.)—to provide the Central Committee of
the R.C.P. with the opportunity, the data, the material, for
evaluating them.

(4) The “GOELRO” as a GOELRO, you must restore as
a subcommission of the General Planning Commission. You
will be chairman of this subcommission too.

(5) You will have to set up quite a number of
subcommissions: we must have a talk about this, when you have
a plan for them.

(6) What will be exceptionally important is the
subcommission on


    study,
     checking
     and
     “tying up”, co-ordination,
     making proposals
     for altering 

current economic plans (for 1921 at the present moment).
Larin must without fail he made a member of this
subcommission but
(1) not as chairman and not as vice–
chairman and not as secretary;
(2) counterbalancing him, say,
with Sereda, as a model of balanced mind, non-fantasy,
non-harrassment.

(7) I suggest that you think over the following plan (I
consider it most important): to oblige a few persons,
members of the General Planning Commission, systematically
to present either to the Commission or to the subcommission
under § 6 reports and articles on the fulfilment by various
departments (and by various gubernias, uyezds, groups
of factories, individual factories, etc.) of current economic
plans and on the comparison of this fulfilment with various
years and for printing in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn. (I
consider it most important that Larin without fail, and also
Sereda, Popov, Strumilin, should be formally obliged to
follow with the greatest attention the facts and figures
of the real fulfilment of our economic plans, and should
print regular notes in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn for public
criticism and checking. Two or three specialists could also
be set to work on this. It is essential that each should answer
individually for the study and the checking; and that on
each part of this work there should be two persons,

    

independent of one another, for mutual checking and for testing
various methods of analysis, summarising, etc.).

Think about all this and let’s have a talk more than once
after your arrival.

Greetings!

Lenin

G.M.,

I return your
speech.[3]

Its main defect: too much about electrification, too little
about current economic plans.

The main emphasis is not laid where it should be.

When I had before me the communist “wiseheads” who
had not read the book The Electrification
Plan[4] and had
not understood its importance and were chattering and
writing nonsense about the plan in general, I had to push
their noses into this book, because there is no other serious
plan and there cannot
be.[1]


If I had before me the people who wrote that book, I
should push their noses not into the book but away from
it—into the problems of current economic plans.

Get down to those problems now, Messrs. Professors!
Your electrification is in alien
Ehren.[2]

Honour to it
indeed. You’ve written the first edition. We’ll make
improvements and publish a second. The specialists in
such-and-such a subcommission will write a dozen decrees
and resolutions on teaching electricity and the
electrification plan, and so forth. We shall endorse them.

But the general slate planning commission should now busy
itself not with this, but immediately, with all its strength,
set about the current economic plans.

Fuel today. For 1921. Now, this spring.


V. I. Lenin.
 1921
 

The gathering of refuse, of scrap, of dead materials.
Making use of them for the purpose of exchange for grain.

And the like.

This is what “their” noses have to be pushed into. This
is what they should be set to work at. Now. Today.
    1–2 subcommissions on electrification.
    9–8 subcommissions on current economic plans.
    That is how the forces should be allocated for the
    year 1921.

Yours,
 Lenin

April 8, 1921

Comrades Lunacharsky, Pokrovsky and Litkens

Signs are increasing that, as regards systematic and
planned work, affairs in the People’s Commissariat of
Education are not improving, in spite of the directives of the
Central Committee and the special instructions of the
Central Committee when the People’s Commissariat of
Education was being reorganised.

When will the main plan of work be drawn up? What
questions will be included in this plan? Such questions
as the writing of textbooks—the library network and its
use—model schools—accountability of the teachers—
programmes for training courses, lectures, classes in
schools—supervision over the degree of effective fulfilment
of programmes and the progress of class studies?

Or other questions? Which?

What questions have been recognised as most important
and urgent?

Are there decisions on this subject? What measures are
being taken for systematic supervision of their fulfilment?

I request a brief reply.

Cipher what is marked in blue
pencil[1]


Orjonikidze

I have received your cipher message about the desperate
food situation in Transcaucasia. We have taken a number of
steps, given a little gold to Armenia, confirmed all kinds
of instructions to the Commissariat of Food. But I must
warn you that we are in great need here, and will not he
able to help. I urgently require that you should set up a
regional economic body for the whole of Transcaucasia,
make the utmost effort with concessions, especially in
Georgia; try and buy seed, even if it be abroad, and push
forward irrigation in Azerbaijan with the help of the
resources of Baku, in order to expand agriculture and
cattle-breeding, and also try and develop commodity exchange
with the North Caucasus. Have you and the Georgian
comrades grasped the significance of our new policy in
connection with the tax in
kind[2]? Read this to them
and keep me more frequently informed; read my letter to
Serebrovsky in Baku.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin marked the following passages: “about the desperate food
situation ... will not be able to help” and “with concessions, especially
in Georgia”.—Ed.
 



[2]
Reference is to NEP (Now Economic Policy)—the policy of the
proletarian stale during the period of transition from capitalism to
socialism. This policy was “new” in contrast to the economic policy
which had been conducted in Soviet Russia in the period of foreign
military intervention and the Civil War, known in history as
the policy of War Communism (1918–20). The latter was made
necessary by war-time conditions, and its characteristic features
were extreme centralisation of production and distribution of
goods, prohibition of free trading, and food requisitioning which
compelled the peasants to turn in all surplus produce to the state.
When the New Economic Policy was adopted,
commodity-money relations became the basic, form of relations between
socialist industry and the small-peasant economy. When food
requisitioning was abolished and replaced by the tax in kind, the
peasants were able to dispose of their surplus produce as they chose,

   

i.e., sell them at the market, and through the market obtain the
industrial goods they required.

The New Economic Policy was calculated to achieve a firm
economic and political alliance between the working class and the
peasantry for the building of socialism, for the development of the
productive forces along socialist lines. It provided for a certain
measure of capitalism while the basic economic positions remained
in the hands of the proletarian state. It assumed the struggle of
the socialist elements against the capitalist elements, the victory
of the socialist elements, the elimination of the exploiting classes,
and the building of socialism in the U.S.S.R.

Anatoly Vasilyevich Lunacharsky
 Copy to the Central Peat Board

In order to expand the output of peat, there must be
a large-scade development of propaganda—leaflets,
pamphlets, mobile exhibitions, films, publication of textbooks;
teaching about the peat industry to be introduced as a
compulsory subject in schools and higher technical colleges;
textbooks must be written; study groups must be sent
abroad annually.

Specifically it is necessary
(1) to instruct the State
Publishing House to print by April 15, 100,000 copies of Peat,
a pamphlet of 1 1/2 signatures, delivered by the Central Peat
Board on February 8 this year to Comrade Mordvinkin
at the Agitation Department, and to accept from the
Central Peat Board another three pamphlets and leaflets,
for publication by May 1; 15,000 copies of the pamphlets
to be issued to the Central Peat Board for
distribution.

(2) To instruct the Film Department to make 12 films
in the course of May—under the direction of the Central
Peat Board—showing how peat is secured (for Russia, the
Ukraine, the Urals, Byelorussia and Siberia).

(3) To instruct the Central Board for Vocational
Training to draw up by June 1, together with the Central Peat
Board, a draft course of compulsory lessons in schools and
higher educational establishments on the peat industry.
 

Please send me copies of your instructions, and the replies
of the institutions and persons concerned, with an
indication of the dates.

 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

April 12

G. M.,

Yesterday I talked with Smilga. He should be having
a talk with you today.

The question of the main features of the state plan, not
as an institution but as a plan, cannot be put off.

You now know the tax in kind and other decrees. There
is the policy for you. And you make as careful a calculation
as possible (taking into account harvests of various sizes)
how much this can produce.

Immeasurably still more urgent is fuel. Timber–
floating has broken down. The bad harvest resulting from such
a spring will thwart deliveries.

Let Ramzin and Co  within two days provide me with
brief summaries: three figures (wood fuel, coal, oil) 

by half-years

1918???
1919
1920
particularly 1921
1922
1920

and the plan for
the fuel plan for
four figures: laid down?
 secured?
 how was the quantity laid down to be
    distributed (only the main headings)?
 how was the quantity secured distributed?
 

By Thursday morning. On this will depend my decision
regarding foreign trade. Order it today. We shall have
a talk tomorrow.

Greetings!

Lenin

G. M.,

Is the instruction clear?

We must presume that we shall have in 1921–22
 the same, or even worse,
    harvest failure
    fuel shortage (on account of lack of food and fodder
       for the horses).

From this point of view there should be calculated what
purchases are needed abroad in order at all costs to
overcome our most dire shortages, i.e., to procure without fail
the foodstuffs that are lacking (by direct purchase of
provisions abroad, and by exchange of goods for grain in the
outlying regions of Russia) and to secure the necessary
additional minimum of fuel.

Only those requirements can and must be justified which
are essential from this point of view.

Not all electrical requirements come under this heading.
It is not enough to demonstrate that electricity economises
fuel.

It must be demonstrated in addition that this expenditure
is essential for 1921–22, given maximum shortage of grain
and fuel.

Comrade Litkens,

I forgot when we met to ask you to check how matters
stand with the committee of scholars who are drawing up
a dictionary (brief) of the contemporary (from Pushkin to
Gorky) Russian language.

I long ago, and many times, made arrangements for this
with Pokrovsky and Lunacharsky.

Is it being done? What precisely? Find out and send
me exact details.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

May 9, 1921

I request you to pay particular attention to the article
in Posledniye
Novosti[1] (Paris) No. 309:

“Milyukov and Avksentyev among the Americans”.

It is essential systematically to record such articles and
paragraphs; there is a mass of them; they should be 
summarised, impressing on our departments and on the reading
public among the workers and peasants 

that the more intelligent whiteguard bourgeoisie
understands perfectly well the importance of
concessions and foreign trade to Soviet power 

and therefore makes it its main task now to thwart
trade agreements between the R.S.F.S.R. and foreign
states, to frustrate the policy of concessions.

Please drop me a line on this question.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

May 16

Comrade M. Sokolov, Secretary of the Department
    for Management of Property Evacuated from Poland

Dear Comrade,

I have received and read your draft report for
May 18.[2]
You write that I have “slipped up”. On the one hand, you
say, by leasing forests, land, etc., we are introducing state
capitalism, and on the other hand, he (Lenin) “talks” about
“expropriating the landowners”.

This seems to you a contradiction.

You are mistaken. Expropriation means deprivation
of property. A lessee is not a property-owner. That
means there is no contradiction.

The introduction of capitalism (in moderation and
skilfully, as I say more than once in my
pamphlet[1]

)

is possible
without restoring the landowners’ property. A lease is a
contract for a period. Both ownership and control remain
with us, the workers’ state.

“What fool of a lessee will spend money on model
organisation,” you write, “if he is pursued by the thought of
possible expropriation...”

Expropriation is a fact, not a possibility. That makes
a big difference. Before actual expropriation not a single
capitalist would have entered our service as a lessee.
Whereas now “they”, the capitalists, have fought three years,

    

and wasted hundreds of millions of rubles in gold of their
own (and those of the Anglo-French, the biggest 
money-bags in the world) on war with us. Now they are having
a bad time abroad. What choice have they? Why should
they not accept an agreement? For 10 years you get not
a bad income, otherwise ... you die of hunger abroad. Many
will hesitate. Even if only five out of 100 try the
experiment, it won’t be too bad.

You write:

“Independent mass activity is possible only when we
wipe off the face of the earth that ulcer which is called the
bureaucratic chief administrations and central boards.”

Although I have not been out in the provinces, I know
this bureaucracy and all the harm it does. Your mistake
is to think that it can be destroyed all at once, like an ulcer,
that it can be “wiped off the face of the earth”.

This is a mistake. You can throw out the tsar, throw
out the landowners, throw out the capitalists. We have
done this. But you cannot “throw out” bureaucracy in a
peasant country, you cannot “wipe it off the face of the
earth”. You can only reduce it by slow and stubborn
effort.

To “throw off” the “bureaucratic ulcer”, as you put it
in another place, is wrong in its very formulation. It means
you don’t understand the question. To “throw off” an ulcer
of this kind is impossible. It can only be healed. Surgery
in this case is an absurdity, an impossibility;
only a slow
care—all the rest is charlatanry or naïveté.

You are naïve, that’s just what it is, excuse my
frankness. But you yourself write about your youth.

It’s naïve to wave aside a healing process by referring
to the fact that you have 2–3 times tried to fight the
bureaucrats and suffered defeat. First of all, I reply to this, your
unsuccessful experiment, you have to try, not 2–3 times,
but 20–30 times—repeat your attempts, start over again.

Secondly, where is the evidence that you fought
correctly, skilfully? Bureaucrats are smart fellows, many
scoundrels among them are extremely cunning. You won’t
catch them with your bare hands. Did you fight correctly?
Did you encircle the “enemy” according to all the rules
of the art of war? I don’t know.
 

It’s no use your quoting
Engels.[3] Was it not some
“intellectual” who suggested that quotation to you? A
futile quotation, if not something worse. It smells of the
doctrinaire. It resembles despair. But for us to despair
is either ridiculous or disgraceful.

The struggle against bureaucracy in a peasant and
absolutely exhausted country is a long job, and this struggle
must be carried on persistently, without losing heart at
the first reverse.

“Throw off” the “chief administrations”? Nonsense. What
will you set up instead? You don’t know. You must not
throw them off, but cleanse them, heal them, heal and cleanse
them ten times and a hundred times. And not lose heart.

If you give your lecture (I have absolutely no objection
to this), read out my letter to you as well, please.

I shake your hand, and beg you not to tolerate the “spirit
of dejection” in yourself.

Lenin

May 19

Take advantage of Pokrovsky’s holiday to begin work
on the compiling of a dictionary of the Russian language
without burdening him with administrative functions.

(1) Appoint a committee of 3–5 of the best philologists.
They should within two weeks draw up a plan and the
composition of the final committee (to
[define][1]

the work,
its nature, time limits, etc.).

(2) The task is a brief dictionary of the Russian
language, from Pushkin to Gorky (the small “Larousse”
as a model). Model, arid contemporary. With the new
orthography.

(3) On the basis of their report (of the 3–5), some 
scientific academic centre must endorse the plan. Then we shall
begin by the autumn.

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky,

You should have been sent the draft “Instructions of the
Council of Labour and
Defence”.[1]


Think it over yourself (and the Presidium too—and all
members of the State Planning Commission should be
informed) from two points of view:

(a) it includes problems concerning your “department”:
electrification and the local bodies of the State Planning
Commission. What is needed in this case is a detailed
analysis and study by all of you, in order to verify and
supplement (resp. alter) the list of detailed problems;

(b) the remainder does not come under the jurisdiction
of the State Planning Commission, but much of it in
essence affects the Commission. The opinion of the latter
is desirable (not obligatory).

Lenin

P.S. Do you not think that it will be necessary to appoint
a group of members of the State Planning Commission to
study the uyezd reports, and all economic reports in general?
Or should all members of the Commission be given several
reports each, with the obligation to read and study them?

By the way: the study of current economic plans (for
1921) must definitely be individualised. Each member of

    

the State Planning Commission answers for such-and-such
a side or part of this work. And vice versa: for every side
or part of economic activities in 1921, from the point of
view of the current plan, so-and-so answers, in the sense
of studying the results. Send this to me without fail.

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky,

I think it is necessary for the State Planning Commission
to work out two things:

(1) through the statistical subcommission, to draw up
a kind of index-number.

A monthly summary of the chief data of our economic
life (figures and a curve). Approximately:

Output of fuel
 ” ore
 ” iron.

The main data about other branches of industry:

% of workers engaged in production;

% of under-fulfilment of sowing plan;

state of agricultural production;

% of locomotives out of action;

absolute number of pood-versts;

timber, wood fuel, etc.;

supplies of foodstuffs, etc.;

electrification likewise

(in each case a comparison with the previous year and
with pre-war).

Without this we shall not have a survey of economic
life.

This is one of the fundamentals for the work of the State
Planning Commission.

(2) A subcommission of economic statistics.
 

The Central Statistical Hoard should ho made into an
organisation that does analysis for us, current, not “
scientific” analysis. For example:

How many superfluous people fed?

How many superfluous factories?

How should raw materials be redistributed? And
labour-power?

The economic work of the army?

Statisticians must be our practical assistants, not engage
in scholastics.

Think over this, and drop me a line about the results.

Yours,
 Lenin

All the Ukrainian comrades most pressingly insist on
intensification of the struggle against profiteering in the
Ukraine, which threatens to disorganise the purchases of
grain for the famine-stricken centres of the Republic,
purchases which have begun and are already showing good
results. Please devote particular attention, and inform me
whether emergency measures are being taken, what
measures in particular and what their results are.

Comrade Smilga
 Copy to the Central Oil Board
 Copy to Comrade Gubkin

Both the press and reports from people on the spot show
more and more frequently that things are getting worse
in Baku.

Care for and attention to Baku must be increased.

Please bring before the Council of Labour and Defence
a programme of systematic measures to aid Baku, making
use of purchases abroad.

Constant “observation” must be established of what is
happening at Baku and how we are helping.

Brief summaries should be drawn up on both items,
(a) what they have,
(b) what we have provided, and supervise
continuously.

Comrade Pavlovich
 People’s Commissariat of Nationalities

May 31, 1921

Comrade Pavlovich,

I have arranged for publication of a school atlas (in
Petrograd).[2]

It would be extremely important to include maps of
imperialism.

Would you not undertake this?

For example:

(1) colonial possessions 1876–1914–1921, adding or
specially shading off semi-colonial countries (Turkey, Persia,
China, and so forth).

(2) Brief statistics of colonies and semi-colonies.

(3) Map of financial dependencies. For example, for each
country ± with a figure (millions or milliards of francs) of
how much this country owes, and how much it is owed;

also comparatively for 1876–1914–1921 

(if 1876 be taken as the culminating point of pre–
monopoly capitalism).

(4) Railways of the world, with a note, in each country,
showing to whom most of them belong (British, French,
North America, etc.).

Will this prove too much of a mixture? Convenient
forms can be found, with what matters, what predominates
noted very briefly.
 

(5) The main sources of those raw materials over which
there is a struggle (oil, ores, etc.)—also with notes (% or
millions of francs belong to such-and-such a country).

We must without fail include maps of this kind in the
textbooks, of course with a brief explanatory text.

A statistical assistant can be given you for the auxiliary
work.

Please reply whether you undertake this, how and when.

With communist greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Litkens,

So let us agree on the question of the dictionary as follows:

(1) Approximately within a month (in the absence of
Pokrovsky) adopt a formal decision and appoint a 
responsible person or persons.

(2) On the basis of this decision draw up a plan of work,
indicating not only the persons responsible but also the
expenditure and rations required.

The plan should provide for the work to begin in August
or September.

June 1

Comrade Avanesov,

You should draw up a circular to all local bodies of the
Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection[2] on the subject of
local economic conferences.

(1) You should require a personal list of all
representatives of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection in all
economic conferences.

(2) You should be immediately informed of every change
in the list.

(3) You should demand that, whether they are
Communists or non-Party people, they should be specially and
personally recommended for their reliability and honesty.

(4) You should demand that they be strictly accountable,
particularly as regards drawing non-Party people into the
work and as regards reports to them, the non-Party people,
on the work of the economic councils.

All this should be brought before the Presidium of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee and adopted, so
that the local bodies conform to it.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Avanesov, V. A. (1884–1930)—joined the Party in 1903. In 1917
he became a member of the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C.;
in 1920–24, Deputy People’s Commissar of the Workers’ and

   

Peasants’ Inspection, member of the Collegium of the Cheka, and
later Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade.





[2]
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) was set up in February
1920 on Lenin’s initiative, on the basis of the reorganised People’s
Commissariat of Slate Control, which had been formed in the early
months of Soviet power. Lenin attached great importance to
control and verification at all levels. He worked out in detail the
principles of organising control in the Soviet state, kept an eye on
Rabkrin’s activity, criticised its shortcomings and did his best to
make it more efficient. In his last articles, “How We Should
Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection” and “Better
Fewer, but Better”, Lenin outlined a plan for reorganising
Rabkrin. The basic principles of Lenin’s plan were to merge Party and
state control and to enlist more workers and peasants in its
activities.

June 3, 1921

Comrade Gubkin
 Central Oil Board

Looking through the journal Neftyanoye i Slantsevoye
Khozyaistvo, I came across a note (p. 199), in No. 1–4 (1921),
“On the Replacement of Metal Tubes by Cement Solution in
the Drilling of Oil Wells”.

It turns out that this can be applied in rotary drilling,
which we have in Baku, as I have read in the report of
the Baku comrades.

We are ruining ourselves and ruining Baku because of
insufficient drilling.

It is possible to replace iron tubes with cement, etc.,
which after all is easier to come by than iron tubes, and
which costs, as your own journal points out, a “quite
insignificant” sum!

And this kind of information you bury in a tiny note
in a super-learned journal, which perhaps one person in
1,000,000 in the R.S.F.S.R. is capable of understanding.

Why didn’t you sound the big bells? Why didn’t you
publish it in the general press? Or appoint a committee
of practical experts? Or get the Council of Labour and
Defence to adopt incentives?

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of Labour and Defence

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky,

I don’t know whether everything has been done to
acquaint members of the Third Congress of the Communist
International with the electrification plan.

If not, it must be done without fail in one-two weeks.

There should be set out (in the lobbies of the Congress) 

(1) a map of electrification, will) a brief text in three
languages 

(2) similarly, regional maps 

(3) the electrification balance-sheet 

 {{


(370 million working days,
 bricks,
 copper, etc.



(4) a map of the most important local, small, new
stations.

There must be a brief (16–24 pp.) pamphlet in three
languages, a summary of the Electrification Plan.

I shall not be able to attend the Council of People’s
Commissars on Tuesday, June 7.

If the question of the Committee for Utilisation arises,
be prepared yourself for a serious battle and make precise
proposals, so that, if the circumstances require, you can
complain to the Central Committee and the All-Russia
Central Executive
Committee.[1]

Yours,
 Lenin
 

In confidence:

A new plot has been discovered in Petrograd.
Intellectuals were participating. Some are professors not very
remote from Osadchy. This has led to a lot of his friends
having their houses searched, and quite right too.

Caution!!!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
When the Regulations on the Council of Labour and Defence’s
Commission for Utilising the Material Resources of the R.S.F.S.R.
were being drawn up, differences of opinion concerning the
functions of the commission arose between A. B. Khalatov (People’s
Commissar for Food), G. M. Krzhizhanovsky (State Planning
Commission), P. A. Bogdanov (Supreme Economic Council) and
L. N. Kritsman (Commission for Utilising Material Resources).

On June 14, 1921, the Council of People’s Commissars endorsed
the amended draft, Regulations drawn up by the State Planning
Commission. On June 29, the Regulations, which on the
instructions of the Council of People’s Commissars had been edited by a
commission composed of Bogdanov, Krzhizhanovsky, Kritsman
and Khalatov, were signed by Lenin.

I am surprised that you are interfering with Stalin’s

July 10

Comrade Bryukhanov,

I have received a letter from Lobachov dated July 9,
indicating a sharp deterioration in the supply situation
in Petrograd and Moscow. He asks for instructions.

In my opinion, you should draw up measures to intensify
the work. I propose 

(1) that you should press immediately, in particularly
urgent, accelerated, revolutionary fashion for collection
of the tax in Moscow Gubernia (the rye has already been
harvested). Moscow workers, in particular, should be
mobilised for this, to assist the food supply organisations.

(2) In general, mobilise more workers for food supply,
plundering the People’s Commissariats, in accordance with
yesterday’s decision of the Political
Bureau[1] (take a copy
of it).

(3) Once more send precise orders to the Ukrainian and
Siberian People’s Commissariats of Food.

(4) Delegate an emergency expedition (together with the
Central Union of Consumers’ Co-operative Societies) to
Podolsk Gubernia where, they say, there are masses of grain
and it costs 6,000 rubles a pood in Soviet currency.

(In general, my impression is that, as regards purchases
and barter, the People’s Commissariat of Food is asleep,
and lagging behind disgracefully. No initiative. No bold
work.)

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

Please reply to me on July 11.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On July 9, 1921, the Political Bureau of the C.C. of the R.C.P.(B.)
passed a decision “On Intensifying Food Work”. It stated: “The
Organising Bureau should confirm the need to take the maximum
number of Communists and, in exceptional cases, other
particularly valuable comrades, from their present work and transfer
them to food work, even at the cost of causing a temporary
closing-down of nine-tenths of departments in some institutions and
even whole People’s Commissariats that are not absolutely
essential.”

First: please inform me of the state of Stalin’s health,
and the doctors’ opinion on this. Secondly, it would be
extremely important for vis to get a concession from the
Turks for the copper mines, south of Batum, which were
ceded to them. Inform me whether any steps have been
taken, and which. Thirdly, Krasin is in Moscow, and this
should be taken advantage of in order to clear up the
position of the Transcaucasian Commissariat of Foreign
Trade. Fourthly, inform me of the state of Reske’s health,
and when his treatment will be completed.

Comrade Korostelev,

The work of your
commission[1] is exceptionally
important, responsible and difficult.

You must strain all your energies to see that you have
fewer reverses; and not lose heart because of the reverses,
but insistently and patiently resume the work, again and
again. In Moscow it is much more difficult to work than
in the provinces—there is more bureaucracy, there are more
corrupted and spoiled “top” people, etc.

But, in return, the work in Moscow will have tremendous
demonstrative and political importance.

In my belief, your commission should try and adapt its
work to the “Instructions of the Council of Labour and
Defence”.

The main thing is not to scatter your forces. It is better
to take a few establishments, not very big tasks, set
yourselves, at first, modest aims—but pursue them stubbornly,
not forgetting what you have begun, not dropping the
work half-way, but going on with it to the end.

Gradually, but without fail, draw in non-Party people
from amongst workers well known for their honesty, and
respected in every district. Time and effort should not be
spared in discovering them and getting to know them.

They should little by little, and carefully, be introduced
to the work, and you must try to find an occupation entirely
suited to each one, and appropriate to his capacities.

The main thing is to get the workers and the population
used to the commission, in the sense that they should see
    

help coming from it; the main thing is to win the confidence
of the masses, the non-Party people, the rank-and-file
workers, the ordinary men in the street.

For you of all people, as chairman of the commission
and as a man from the centre, a member of the collegium
of the unpopular Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, this
will not be easy. But this is the whole essence of the thing.

You must in every possible way, and in all possible respects
show that you are able to give, and actually give, help,
real help, even if on a small scale. Only on this basis can
you go on further.

Please write to me or, if you don’t like writing, ring
me up on the telephone—I can talk to you from my study,
where it is quieter, so that we can exchange ideas on the
work of your commission.

Show this letter to the other members of the commission,
if you think it timely.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

July 26

P.S. The main task of the commission is to improve
our economy, improve management, secure real personal
responsibility. For this purpose a few more institutions
should be selected: a canteen, baths, a laundry, a hostel,
etc.

July 29

Comrade Khinchuk,

They say you are leaving? For how many months? Before
your departure it is essential that you should both officially
get your “deputy” appointed and, unofficially, should let
me know to which of the Communists who are fully
experienced people (2–3 of them) in the Central Union of
Consumers’ Co-operative Societies I can address myself.

Then before your departure you must tell me, very briefly,
when the machinery of the co-operative movement will
begin working at last.

What I mean is this:

(1) In how many volosts (of such-and-such gubernias) are
there shops (co-operatives) and, consequently, your trading
agents, and in how many are there none? How many per
volost?

(2) How many of the shops (agents) reply promptly to
all the questions of the centre, and render reports? Once
a week? Once a fortnight?

(3) How many volost shops have received goods, and
which (even the briefest replies)? Salt? Kerosene?
Textiles? etc.

(4) How many replies are there about the amount of
surpluses and raw materials held by the peasants (which
can be acquired in exchange for this or that)?

grain?

other foodstuffs?

industrial raw materials? etc.
 

(5) How much have you exchanged during I he period
under review? Of what, for what?

In my opinion, so long as there are no such reports, there
is nothing. Only talk.

I await your reply.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

Copy to the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet
  ” to the People’s Commissariat of Education

Comrade Smolyaninov has informed me that a workers’
and peasants’ delegation from Stavropol Gubernia has
delivered to Moscow, addressed to me, a railway wagon of
food for the hungry workers, as a gift. Please, in the first
place, take over this wagon as rapidly as possible, without
any red tape; secondly, dispatch it to the most needy
Moscow workers, notifying them without fail that this
is a present from the Stavropol workers and peasants;
thirdly, see to it that the delegation is looked after,
both in the sense of its being put up properly and of its
receiving thanks from the Moscow Soviet, and, finally,
that they are supplied with literature and given the
opportunity of seeing the institutions in Moscow which interest
them.

Please report fulfilment to me, immediately and
precisely.

August 2

Comrade Adoratsky,

I have looked through the introduction. It’s difficult
to judge, because it’s unfinished. It looks as though it
should be cut down, and expressed much more clearly,
with closer attention to the
formulations.[1]

The really outstanding quotations from the letters should
be combined with other works of Marx and with Capital
(for example, on the question of “equality” what matters
most is in
Capital[2]).
If you take question x, then on this
question there is so-and-so in the letters, so-and-so in other
works of Marx, so-and-so in Capital.

I could only glance at the letters. Of course, you will
still have to cut them clown considerably, link them up,
arrange them properly; think over each one two or three
times, and then briefly comment. Evidently there is more
work involved than it seemed at first.

The chronological order (very likely you are right) is
probably more convenient.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. I am on holiday. Unwell. Can’t make appointments.

If you have finished the “textbook”, you should start
pushing
it.[3] Probably the quickest way is through
M.\thinspaceN. Pokrovsky.

Comrade Teodorovich (P.C.A.) and
 the State Publishing House

August 7

Among the new books I have received from the State
Publishing House is 

Semyon Maslov: “The Peasant Economy”. 1921. 5thed.!
(or 4thed.).

Looking it through, I see that it is a dirty bourgeois
little book from beginning to end, stuffing up the mind
of the muzhik with sham bourgeois “scientific” lies.

Nearly 400 pages, and nothing about the Soviet system
and its policy, about our laws and measures for transition
to socialism, etc.

Only a fool or a malicious saboteur could have passed
this book.

Please investigate and send me the names of all those
responsible for editing and publishing it.

August 7

Comrade Safarov,

Thank you very much for the
pamphlet[1] and other
material.

We are sending Joffe to make an attempt to combine
your line and Tomsky’s.

That must be done.

Unquestionably grain and meat to Moscow, first and
foremost.

For this purpose, both the “New Economic Policy” in
general and a number of concessions and bonuses to the
merchants.

At the same time, systematic and maximum concern
for the Moslem poor, for their organisation and education.

Such a policy can and must be worked out and fixed (in
a number of the most precise directives).

It must be a model for the whole East.

Best greetings.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. After the line has been worked out, you, too, will
probably be granted leave.

To the People’s Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs

Typed copies to

 {{


(1) addressee
 (2) me
 (3) N. P. Gorbunov



Comrade Dovgalevsky,

Please let me have information about the state of wireless
telephony in our country.

1) Is the Central Moscow Station working? If so, how
many hours a day, and over what distance in versts?

If not, what is lacking?

2) Are we manufacturing (and how many?) receivers,
installations capable of voice reception from Moscow?

3) How do matters stand with loudspeakers,
installations which enable a whole hall (or square) to hear Moscow?

Etc.

I am very much afraid that this business has once again
“gone to sleep” (in the damnable manner of the
Russian
Oblomovs,[1] putting everyone and everything to sleep).

It has been “promised” many times, and all time limits
have long ago expired!

The importance of this affair for us (for propaganda in
the East especially) is exceptional. Delay and negligence
here are criminal.

All this already exists abroad; what is lacking can and

    

must be bought. In all probability, there is criminal
negligence somewhere.

Typed on headed notepaper to

copies to

{{

(1) the addressee

(2) me

(3) Avanesov

(4) Gorbunov and Smolyaninov



I have sent you through the Office Manager of the Council
of People’s Commissars a statement from Professor Graftio
with astonishing documents about red
tape.[1]

This red tape is just what is to be expected, especially
in the Moscow and central institutions. But all the more
attention should be given to fighting it.

My impression is that the People’s Commissariat of
Justice is purely formal, i.e., radically wrong, in its
attitude to this question.

What is needed is:

(1) to bring this matter before the courts;

(2) to secure the disgrace of those guilty, both in the
press and by strict punishment;

(3) to stiffen up the judges through the Central
Committee, so that they punish red tape more severely;

(4) to arrange a conference of the Moscow People’s
Judges, members of tribunals, etc., to work out effective
measures for fighting red tape;
 

(5) without fail, this autumn and winter of 1921–22,
to bring up for trial in Moscow 4–6 cases of Moscow red
tape, selecting the more “vivid” cases, and making each
trial a political affair;

(6) to find some, if only 2–3, sensible “experts” on
questions of red tape, among the more fierce and militant
Communists (get bold of Sosnovsky), so as to train people
to hound out red tape;

(7) to publish a good, intelligent, non-bureaucratic letter
(a circular of the People’s Commissariat of Justice) on the
struggle against red tape.

I impose this most important task on the People’s
Commissar and his deputy, on their personal responsibility,
and request that I be given regular information as to its
fulfilment.

 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

September 27, 1921

Comrade Yezhov, Head of Central Stores Board,
  Supreme Economic Council

Comrade Yezhov,

I have received and looked through the papers about
the store.

Transfer to the Supreme Economic Council has now
been
decided.[1]

I will expect you to let me have brief but precise reports
on whether in practice any improvement in the stores
business is being achieved, how the struggle against pilfering
is going, as regards this store and other stores.

I am obliged to charge you, too, with red tape: “We’ve
been shouting for three years”, “I took the matter through
to the end nearly ten times, it seemed,” you write. But the
whole trouble is that not once did you take the matter
through to the end, without any “it seemed”.

You know the Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R. and the
Rules of the R.C.P. “To the end” means up to the
session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
(if there is no Congress of Soviets). In the Party line, it
means the plenary meeting of the Central Committee.

You have not once taken the matter through to the end.

(1) A brief, “telegraphic”, but clear and precise
statement to members of the C.C. and members of the
Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee;

(2) an article in the press;
 

(3) an initiative by the local or neighbouring unit of
the R.C.P., its opinion, its question asked at the Moscow
Soviet 

—these are three measures which arc obligatory in the
struggle against red tape.

This is a difficult struggle, that goes without saying.

But the difficult is not the impossible.

You gave up in despair, you did not fight, you did not
exhaust all the means of fighting.

The stores business requires much more insistence in
the struggle against red tape—checking “from below” and
“by those below”—publicity in the press—checking again
and again—etc.

I should like to hope that, having now had a painful
and melancholy but useful experience, you will set about,
this battle with red tape in such a way as to really take
the matter through “to the end”.

From time to time one must know the results of this
struggle.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. Will you not send on some occasion, together with
brief, quite brief information about the course of the struggle
(with red tape), brief data about your staff (the number
of people, how many of them are Communists, their
qualifications; responsible, purely executive, office workers,
etc.) and a brief plan of your work?

Write briefly, in cablese, separating out special points,
if necessary. I won’t read a long document at all, that’s
certain.

If there are practical proposals, put them down on a
separate sheet, extremely brief, like a telegram, with a copy
to my secretary.

Lenin

Comrade Gorbunov,

Please get a decision, after the necessary agreement with
the Chairman of the Narrow Council of People’s
Commissars (and clearing the matter with the secretaries), that
the system for summoning rapporteurs (both to the Full
and the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars) should
be altered.

At present those who have to report get a general
summons to the meeting and wait for hours.

This is outrageous and barbarous.

You must see to it that they are told to come at one
particular time.

Provided there is a double check by telephone, whether
rapporteurs are needed, and which; provided there is a
correct distribution of the agenda of the given meeting
(business requiring rapporteurs, business not requiring
them), we can and must see to it that rapporteurs do not
wait more than 15 minutes.

Please, work out such a system without delay,
considering it carefully, and let me have a decision on the subject,
adopted by the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

October 13, 1921

Comrade Hillman,

I thank you with all my heart for your help. Thanks
to you an agreement was rapidly achieved on organisation
of help for Soviet Russia by the American workers.
Particularly important is the fact that the organisation of this
aid has now been arranged in respect also of (hose workers
who are not Communists. Throughout the world, and
particularly in the most advanced capitalist countries,
millions of workers do not at the present lime share the views
of the Communists, but nonetheless are ready to help
Soviet, Russia, to help and feed the starving, if only some
of them, and to help the cause of restoring the economy
of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. Such
workers repeal with complete conviction the words—and
what is more important not only repeat the words but give
them practical expression in life—of the leaders of the
Amsterdam Trade Union International (unquestionably
hostile to communism), namely, that any victory of the
international bourgeoisie over Soviet Russia would mean the
greatest possible victory of world reaction over the
working class in general.

Soviet Russia is exerting all her strength to overcome
starvation, ruin and dislocation. The financial aid of the
workers of the whole world is infinitely important for
us in this respect, side by side with moral help and political
help. America, naturally, is at the head of the states where
the workers can help us, are already helping us and will
help—I am profoundly convinced—on a far greater scale.
 

Devoted to the cause, the energetic advanced workers
of America will be taking the lead of all the workers of
a number of industrial countries who arc bringing Soviet
Russia I heir technical knowledge, and their determination
to make sacrifices in order to help the Workers’ and
Peasants’ Republic to restore its economy. Among the peaceful
means of struggle against the yoke of international finance
capital, against international reaction, there is no other
means with such rapid and certain promise of victory as
aid in the restoration of the economy of Soviet Russia.

With best greetings to all workers who are bringing aid,
in one form or another, to Soviet Russia.

N. Lenin

October 24, 1921

Comrade Semashko,

After signing today the decision of the Narrow Council
of People’s Commissars on the 2,000 millions (I think that
is the
Figure?[1] I don’t remember it exactly) for cleaning
up Moscow, and after reading the “Regulations” of the
People’s Commissariat of Health for the week of housing
sanitation (Izvestia of July 12), I have come to the
conclusion that my suspicions (about the complete inadequacy
of the organisation of the whole business) are increasing.

The thousand millions will be taken, stolen and pilfered
but the job won’t be done.

We must secure model (or at least, as a beginning, 
tolerable) cleanliness in Moscow, for one cannot even imagine
a greater scandal than “Soviet” dirt in the “first” Soviet
houses. What then is to be expected in houses which are
not first?

Please send me the most brief but precise, business-like,
factual report on what has been achieved by the week of
sanitation, and where? Is there any gubernia where
something has been done without muddle?

Further. What is being done (and what has been done?)
in Moscow? Who answers for this work? Is it only “officials”
with a pompous Soviet title, who don’t understand a thing,
who don’t know the business and only sign papers? Or are
there business-like people in charge? Who in particular?

The most important thing is to secure personal
responsibility.


V. I. Lenin watches the trials of the first Soviet electric plough
at the training and experimental farm of the Moscow Zootechnics
Institute. October 22, 1921
 

What has been done to secure personal responsibility?

Checking is done by whom?

By inspectors? How many are there? Who are they?

By youth detachments (Young Communist League)? Do
such exist? How many? Where and how have they given
examples of their work?

What other methods for real checking are there?

Is money being spent on buying valuable articles (
carbolic? cleaning equipment? how much has been bought?)
or is it being spent on maintaining new “official” loafers?

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

G. M.,

I have read it, and approve very, very
much.[1] Get it
ready as soon as possible, dictate it.

One addition, in my opinion, is essential about the New
Economic Policy. I think it would he hotter to insert it
(throwing light from different points of view on the place,
the significance, the role in the general framework of the
New Economic Policy) in the separate chapters. Almost
in every chapter you can (and should, in my belief) add
a page or two about the fact that the New Economic Policy
does not change the single state economic plan, and does
not go beyond its framework, but alters the approach to
its realisation.

Your opinion?

Greetings,
 Lenin

Comrade Yenukidze,

Cannot the vacating of the apartment, promised to

I ask you particularly to do this and to ring me up (the
telephone is a good one; through the upper switchboard)
whether you are being successful, or whether there are
obstacles.

Comrade Kursky
 People’s Commissariat of Justice

I have received two communications from the People’s
Commissariat of Justice—of November 14 and December 
20—on the “fulfilment” of my instruction to organise a
systematic campaign against red tape.

In the first communication you write:

“It involves a great deal of labour to single out
the processes in which this organisational defect (viz.,
the ponderousness and bureaucratic complexity of
our apparatus, inter-departmental relations, friction,
etc.) does not have such a decisive effect, and red tape
is the result of the activity of persons, and not, an
objective consequence of the insufficiently smooth
working of our apparatus.”




With such an approach, of course, nothing will come of
the struggle against red tape. It is the responsible persons
who are to blame for these “organisational defects”; these,
and no others, are the ones we must learn to prosecute and
punish with exemplary severity. You will never catch
a saboteur engaged in red tape.

The second communication from the People’s
Commissariat of Justice, signed by Krasikov, and the attached
reports of the investigators of “exceptionally important
cases”—Vyukov, Roizman and Kedrov, a member of the
staff of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection—truly
discover America. These reports, in a pretty illiterate form,

    

set forth standard platitudes about bureaucracy, complexity
of apparatus, etc., etc.

In a word, it is obvious that the struggle against red
tape has not moved ahead one iota.

In essence, I have not received an exhaustive reply to
a single one of the five tasks which I laid down.

I suggest that you once again examine the question and
organise the struggle against red tape in business-like
fashion, according to all the rules of war.

I ask you by the 20th of each month, without any
preliminary reminders, to send me a report on the course of
the campaign.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

     NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE WORK
 OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS
       AND THE COUNCIL OF LABOUR AND DEFENCE

January 24, 1922

Comrade Tsyurupa,

In connection with our telephone conversation yesterday,
and your promise to observe a strict regime, we need to have
a detailed talk on the whole system of work, and to think it
over thoroughly.

The most radical defect of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D.
is the absence of any checking-up on fulfilment. We are
being sucked down by the rotten bureaucratic swamp into
writing papers, jawing about decrees, drawing up decrees—
and in this sea of paper live work is being drowned.

Clever saboteurs are deliberately luring us into this paper
swamp. Most of the People’s Commissars and other grandees
are, quite unconsciously, “sticking their heads into the
noose”.

The strict medical regime laid down for you must be used
at all costs to break away from turmoil and commotion,
commissions, talking and writing of papers—to break away,
to think over the system of work and radically reform it.

The centre of gravity of your activities must be just this
refashioning of our disgustingly bureaucratic way of work,
the struggle against bureaucracy and red tape, the
checking-up on fulfilment.

The checking-up on fulfilment, the checking-up on what
happens in practice—this is your main and principal task.

    

You should set up for this a little staff (four–six persons)
of particularly tried and tested assistants (an office manager,
his assistants, a secretary and such like).

For this purpose, in my opinion, it is essential:

(1) to relieve the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. of unnecessary
burdens, transferring all petty questions to the Narrow
Council of People’s Commissars and the procedural meetings of
the C.L.D.

This has begun. But it will “come apart” in two weeks,
given our damned Oblomov ways, if it is not followed up,
chased up, checked up, flogged along with three knouts.

The office manager must be taught (just as the
Secretariat of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. should be)
to watch very
closely to see that petty questions are not brought before
the C.P.C. and the C.L.D., and that all questions in general
first go through a triple filter (an inquiry to the
appropriate People’s Commissariats; their urgent reply; the same
from the Codification Department, etc., etc.).

You and
Gorbunov[1]

must together work out written
regulations for the bringing forward and consideration of
questions, and check not less than once a month, you
personally, whether the regulations are being observed and
whether they are achieving their object, i.e., reduction of
paper work, red tape, more forethought, more sense of
responsibility on the part of the People’s Commissars, 
replacement of half-baked decrees by careful, prolonged,
businesslike checking-up on fulfilment and by
checking of experience,
establishment of personal responsibility (in effect, we have
complete irresponsibility at the top, in the People’s
Commissariats and in their departments, and the saboteurs make
magnificent use of this: as a result we have an Oblomov
situation which wrecks all business).

I know that this is extraordinarily difficult. But just
because it is difficult, you must devote yourself entirely
to this matter.

Hence 

(2) a minimum of sessions. The standard should be once
a week for the Council of People’s Commissars + once a week
for the Council of Labour and Defence, two hours each.
 

(3) The Supreme Economic Commission. Close down all
its subcommissions as rapidly as possible, and replace them
by demanding of the People’s Commissars that each of them
should have responsible people to write drafts, that the
People’s Commissar should endorse them, and that he himself
should get them co-ordinated in the briefest possible time
with all “interested” People’s Commissars and at the C.L.D.
or the C.P.C.

The Supreme Economic Commission should exist only
for co-ordination (codification) and the most rapid checking
(stamping) by yourself plus Kamenev.

Only for this.

Not for talk.

Not for discussion.

(4) You are not to become a member of a single
commission, not one, except the Supreme Economic Commission.

(5) To fight the outrageous abundance of commissions,
replacing them by a formal demand for a written opinion in
the shortest possible time.

(6) You must in this way set yourself free from commotion
and turmoil, which are killing all of us, and make it possible
for you to think calmly about the work as a whole—

—and particularly to concentrate on checking-up on
fulfilment, on fighting bureaucracy and red tape.

I beg you to think over this whole question, and to write
to me.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

 A PROGRAMME FOR WORK ON NEW LINES

February 20

Comrade Tsyurupa,

More on the subject of work on new lines.

I will try to formulate its programme in this way:

(1) the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. to be made ten times more
compact, in the sense that the People’s Commissars should
not dare to bring trivial matters before them, but should
decide them themselves and answer for them themselves;

(2) the staff of the Managing Department of the C.P.C.
(at present three-quarters idle) should be made responsible
for this, for putting this into effect;

(3) the same applies to the Narrow Council of People’s
Commissars, plus its especial reduction in size;

(4) some of the members of the Narrow Council and its
staff, and also the staff of the Managing Department of the
C.P.C., to be taken by you under your personal command in
order to check up on effective fulfilment (you instruct
so-and-so: take a journey down there, look, read, check up,
you will answer for any bungling through gullibility).

(5) You (and Rykov) must devote first and foremost one
hour, or if your health permits, two, every day, to
personal checking-up on the work: you summon to your office
(or visit) not grandees, but members of Collegiums and
lower, practical workers of the People’s Commissariat of X,
Y, Z—and check up on their work, get down to rock-bottom,
school them, teach them, give them a proper trouncing.

    

Study people, search for able workers. This is now the essence;
all orders and decisions without this are dirty bits of
paper.

Reply to me. We shall think it over, consult with members
of the Central Committee, and as rapidly as possible fix
such a (or some other) programme.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. But Bryukhanov is not suitable. Someone else must
be found. For the time being you had better set up a “trio”
there, something pretty strong.

    PROPOSAL FOR THE DRAFT DIRECTIVE
   TO THE NARROW COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS

Comrade Tsyurupa,

I send yon my addition. My advice is to get brief comments
from all People’s Commissars and all members of the Narrow
Council of People’s Commissars by Thursday.

Yours,
 Lenin

A special supplementary decision should lay down:
The principal task of the Narrow Council of People’s
Commissars must be strict watchfulness that the People’s
Commissariats
(1) observe the laws,
(2) do not evade
responsibility by needlessly transferring a mass of unnecessary
questions to the Narrow Council for decision, but should
decide the questions themselves, on their own
responsibility or by agreement between two or more People’s
Commissariats under ordinary procedure;
(3) checking the legality,
expediency and rapidity of individual instructions and acts
of the People’s Commissariats; the struggle against
bureaucracy and red tape by such checking, and by persistent
reduction of the number of officials.

   DRAFT DIRECTIVE REGARDING THE WORK
 OF THE COUNCIL OF LABOUR AND DEFENCE,
   THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS
      AND ALSO THE NARROW COUNCIL
      OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS

The chief defect of these institutions is that they are
overburdened with trivial matters. As a result, they are
floundering in bureaucracy instead of fighting it.

The causes of this evil are:
(1) the weakness of the
Managing Department,
(2) the inability of the People’s Commissars
to climb out of the mire of trivialities arid bureaucratic
details,
(3) the desire of the People’s Commissars (and still
more that of their departmental bureaucrats who egg them
on) to shift responsibility on to the C.P.C.,
(4) last and most
important—the fact that responsible workers do not realise
that the order of the day now is to fight the sea of paper and
show distrust of it and of the eternal “reorganisations”,
that the first task of the moment is not decrees, not
reorganisations but selection of people;
establishment of individual
responsibility for what is being done; checking-up on work
actually performed. Otherwise we shall not climb out of the
bureaucracy and red tape which are throttling us.

The Narrow Council of People’s Commissars, the C.L.D.
and the C.P.C. must go all out to get rid of trivialities,
teaching the People’s Commissariats to settle minor matters
themselves and to answer for them more strictly.

The staff of the Managing Department of the C.P.C. must
regard as its main task the practical realisation of the

    

following: to reduce the number of matters coming before the
Narrow C.P.C., the C.L.D. and the C.P.C., and to ensure that
the People’s Commissars (severally and jointly) should
decide more themselves and answer for it; to shift the centre
of gravity to checking up on effective fulfilment.

For the same purpose, the Deputy Chairmen of the C.P.C.,
Comrades Rykov and Tsyurupa, must go all out to free
themselves of trivial matters and commissions, fight against
attempts to drag them (the deputies) into matters which
should be settled by the People’s Commissars; devote two or
three hours a day, as a minimum, to making the personal
acquaintance of the responsible workers (not the grandees)
of the most important (and later, all) People’s
Commissariats, in order to check up and select people; make use of the
staff of the Managing Department of the C.P.C. and some
of the members of the Narrow Council, and also the Workers’
and Peasants’ Inspection, to check up on the work actually
done and what success it has had; in short, they should
become practical instructors in administrative work, such
as we lack most of all.

Distrust of decrees, of institutions, of “reorganisations”
and of grandees, especially among Communists; struggle
against the mire of bureaucracy and red tape by checking
up on people and on the actual work done; merciless
expulsion of unnecessary officials, reduction of staff, replacement
of Communists who don’t study the art of management
seriously—such must be the line of the People’s Commissars
and the C.P.C., of its Chairman and his Deputy Chairmen.

January 28, 1922

G. M.,

I have read Gorev’s
work[1] and return it.

I expected more. A former Bolshevik, who captivated
you so, and who, in your opinion, had once again become
a real Bolshevik, should have produced impressive, vivid,
powerful, popular propaganda, a defence of communism
for France, starting from her electrification.

But Gorev’s work has turned out “professorial”.

I offer the following plan for your consideration:

(1) send it to be set at once, in order to publish it soon in
any case;

(2) suggest to Gorev—if you agree—that he should write
in addition a preface or an afterword, in which he should
in very clear and popular form and a little more freely (
prescribe for him to this end three grammes of extract of
Larinism: they say it has appeared on sale in Moscow) attack
French capitalism, and say to the French workers and
peasants: you could become in three-five years three times as
rich, and work not more than six hours a day (approximately)
if there were a Soviet government in France putting
electrification into effect;

(3) if in your (or Gorev’s) opinion, Gorev will do this badly
or unwillingly, then think over whether someone should
not be asked to do this work separately (a brief
“Ballod”[2]
for France);
 

(4) send me Gorev’s article, as soon as you can, once it is
set up (to he published as a pamphlet or in some journal,
whichever you choose). Perhaps I will write an
introduction.[3] 

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Top secret

Comrade Sokolnikov
 Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Krzhizhanovsky

You said to me that some of our trusts may, in the
immediate future, find themselves without any money and ask us
in an ultimatum to nationalise them. I think that trusts
and factories have been founded on a self-supporting basis
precisely in order that they themselves should be
responsible and, moreover, fully responsible, for their enterprises
working without a deficit. If it turns out that they have not
achieved this, then, in my opinion, they must be prosecuted
and punished, as regards all the members of their boards
of management, by prolonged terms of imprisonment (
perhaps applying conditional release after a certain time),
confiscation of all their property, etc.

If, after setting up trusts and enterprises on a self–
supporting basis, we do not prove able by business-like, mercantile
methods fully to protect our interests, we shall turn out to be
complete idiots.

The Supreme Economic Council must watch over this,
but still more the People’s Commissariat of Finance through
the Stale Bank and through special inspectors, since it is
precisely the People’s Commissariat of Finance which, not
being directly interested, is obliged to establish effective
and real control and supervision.

Lenin

February 15, 1922

Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Kamenev

Comrade Sokolnikov,

Should not the main attention be directed to the
development of trade, and to supervision of it through the Trade
Department of the State Bank?

Should we not organise this matter so as to find two
or three dozen (or even less, if our damned bureaucratic
machine cannot cope with such a “difficult” task)
representatives of the Trade Department of the State Bank, and so
that these representatives should receive bonuses in
proportion to the growth of commercial turnover in those
enterprises or territorial regions which have been “entrusted” to
them?

It would seem to me that this would be more realistic
than selling up special commissions or institutions which,
given our rotten customs (with pretensions to “true
communism”), will inevitably degenerate into bureaucratic stupidity.
Meanwhile the Trade Department of the State Bank must be
given a clear practical task—to develop internal trade and
take it under its own control. And for the development of
operations let both the representatives and the members
of the board (if there are members of the board in the Trade
Department of the State Bank) receive their bonuses—but
only for the development of operations.

Judging by what Gorbunov has told me about the results
of his “troubles” over the Belov and
GUM[1] affair, it is clear
that the Trade Department of the State Bank is at fault
here. They slept in, they missed the bus, they waited, like

    

real jack-in-office scoundrels, for an order “from above”.
I think the Trade Department should be punished at once for
this, where it hurts most, with the warning: one more such
yawn, one more such display of sleepiness—and it means
prison.

Another practical means, it would seem to me, is the
registration of private commercial deals arid a tax on them, by
means of a stamp duty or something similar. How does this
question stand? Cannot private trade be placed in such
a way (or begin to be placed) under the control of the People’s
Commissariat of Finance and the State Bank?

I think that the success of the work of the entire People’s
Commissariat of Finance should be measured 99 per cent by
the development of state trade and of the Trade Department
of the State Bank (in the granting of credit to private trade).
Everything else counts only 1 per cent.

With communist greeting,
 Lenin

director at the time.

February 22

Comrade Sokolnikov,

The question is not just of GUM alone. All the work of all
our economic bodies suffers most of all from bureaucracy.
Communists have become bureaucrats. If anything will
destroy us, it is this. And for the State Bank it is most
dangerous of all to be bureaucratic. We are still thinking in terms
of decrees, of institutions. This is the mistake. The whole
essence now is practical men and practice. To find people who
are men of business (1 out of 100; 1 out of 1,000 Communists,
and that only with God’s help); to transform our decrees
out of dirty paper (it’s all the same whether they arc bad
or good decrees) into living practice—that is the essence.

Whether the State Bank itself should trade, or through
subordinate firms, through its agents, or through its client
debtors, etc.—I don’t know. I don’t take it upon myself to
judge, because I am not sufficiently acquainted with the
technique of currency circulation and banking business.
But what I do know firmly is that the whole problem now
is the rapid development of state trade (in all its varieties:
co-operation, clients of the State Bank, mixed companies,
factors, agents, etc., etc.).

February 28

On account of my illness I did not finish and send away
this letter. You speak (in your interview) about replacing
state trusts by mixed companies. There will be no practical
results. The clever capitalists will draw stupid (most honest
and most virtuous) Communists into the mixed companies,

    

and swindle us as they are swindling us now. The problem
now is not one of institutions but of people, and of checking
up on practical experience. One by one we must discover
people who know how to trade, and step by step use their
experience, their labour, to clean out the..., expelling the
virtuous Communists from boards of management, shutting
down sleepy (and strictly communist) enterprises, shutting
them down, separating out the one per cent which are worth
while. Either the People’s Commissariat of Finance will
prove able to got over to such work, or the entire People’s
Commissariat of Finance=0.

Yours,
 Lenin

April 6, 1922

G. M.,

Yesterday
Martens[1] told me that the existence of an
unheard-of wealth of iron deposits in Kursk Gubernia has
been “proved” (you said “nearly”).

If that is so, should we not already this spring—

(1) put down the necessary narrow-gauge lines there?

(2) Prepare the nearest peatbog (or bogs?) for
exploitation, so that an electric power station can be put up there?

If this does not seem to yon unnecessary, write to Martens
about it (and two words to me).

Martens wants to go there in three weeks’ time. I have
written to Rykov and Tsyurupa that be should also be given
an engineer from the State Planning Commission.

This business must be pushed ahead with particular energy.
I am very much afraid that without triple checks it will
go to sleep. When I leave, don’t forget that Rykov and
Tsyurupa have my letter about it.

Yours,
 Lenin

Moscow. April 10, 1922

Dear Mr. Steinmetz,

I thank you cordially for your friendly letter of February 
16, 1922. I must admit to my shame that I heard your name
for the first time only a few months ago from Comrade
Krzhizhanovsky, who was the Chairman of our State Commission
for Working out a Plan for the Electrification of Russia and
is now Chairman of the State General Planning Commission.
He told me of the outstanding position which you have
gained among the electrical engineers of the whole world.

Comrade Martens has now made me better acquainted by
his accounts of you. I have seen from these accounts that
your sympathies with Soviet Russia have been aroused,
on the one hand, by your social and political views. On the
other hand, as a representative of electrical engineering and
particularly in one of the technically advanced countries,
you have become convinced of the necessity and
inevitability of the replacement of capitalism by a new social order,
which will establish the planned regulation of economy and
ensure the welfare of the entire mass of the people on the basis
of the electrification of entire countries. In all the
countries of the world there is growing—more slowly than one
would like, but irresistibly and unswervingly—the number
of representatives of science, technology, art, who are
becoming convinced of the necessity of replacing capitalism by
a different socio-economic system, and whom the “terrible
difficulties”[1]

of the struggle of Soviet Russia against the

    

entire capitalist world do not repel, do not frighten away but,
on the contrary, lead to an understanding of the
inevitability of the struggle and the necessity of taking what part in
it they can, helping the new to overcome the old.

In particular, I want to thank you for your offer to help
Russia will) your advice, suggestions, etc. As the absence of
official and legally recognised relations between Soviet
Russia and the United Stales makes the practical
realisation of your offer extremely difficult both for us and for you,
I will allow myself to publish both your letter and my reply,
in the hope that many persons who live in America, or in
countries connected by commercial treaties both with the
United States and with Russia, will then help you (by
information, by translations from Russian into English, etc.)
to give effect to your intention of helping the Soviet Republic.

With very best greetings.

Yours fraternally,
 Lenin

Comrade Bukharin,

I send you today’s Pravda. Now, why print stupidities in
the guise of the article by
Pletnyov,[1] who puts on pompous
airs with all the learned and fashionable words he can? I have
marked two stupidities and put a number of question marks.
The author has to learn not “proletarian” science, but simply
to learn. Can it be that the editorial board of Pravda is not
going to explain the author’s mistakes to him? Why, this
is falsification of historical materialism! Playing at
historical materialism!

Yours,
 Lenin

culture”. For a criticism of the views of the Proletcult supporters

Comrade Bogdanov,

Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council

Copies:

Planning Commission

” Comrade Vladimirov, People’s Commissariat of
Finance

” Presidium of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee

” Comrade Kamenev, Deputy Chairman of the
Council of People’s Commissars and

” Comrade L. B. Krasin

Comrade Krasin has sent me a letter in which he tells
me of the very great successes of a group of engineers,
headed by Comrade Gubkin, who, with stubbornness bordering
on the heroic, and with insignificant support by state
organisations, have not only developed from zero the detailed
scientific investigation of combustible slates and sapropelite,
but have also learned in practice to produce out of these
minerals various useful products, such as ichthyol, black
varnish, various soaps, paraffins, ammonium sulphate, etc.

In view of the fact that this work, as Comrade Krasin
testifies, represents a firm foundation for an industry which
in ten or twenty years will produce hundreds of millions for
Russia, I propose that:

(1) the further development of this work be immediately
guaranteed in the financial sense;
 

(2) all obstacles retarding it be eliminated, now and
henceforth;

(3) this group of engineers be awarded the Order of the
Red Banner of Labour and a large sum of money.

Please inform me of further developments in writing
through Comrade Gorbunov, Office Manager of the C.P.C.
In the event of any obstacles arising, inform me immediately
through the same channel.

Dear Ivan Ivanovich,

I have read your article about
specialists.[2]

I don’t agree. Two points.

The first is at the beginning (the third column from the
beginning): “The proletarian dictatorship will collapse if,
in the first
place...[1]

”

(this is correct) “and secondly, if these
specialists are not our own specialists, such as see their aim
to be the consolidation and development of the dictatorship
of the proletariat.”

What I have underlined is incorrect. We shall not have
such specialists for a long time, until the bourgeois
specialists, the petty-bourgeois specialists have disappeared, until
all the specialists have become Communists. Yet the
proletarian dictatorship must certainly not “collapse” in the
meantime. A lesser condition will be enough—namely, the
first. The second does not imperil our existence. It is
sufficient to “have at our disposal”.

For a long time yet there will be doubts, uncertainty,
intrigues, betrayals, etc. The second condition will last
until the end of the dictatorship, and therefore is not a
condition of the dictatorship.

Now the second point, at the end of the article, the third
and second paragraphs from the end.

“The class struggle ... no more abnormal than the
relations which it
expresses.”[3]
 

Untrue, It is untrue, and not merely abnormal. It is worse
than abnormal: it is scientifically untrue. This is not the
class struggle.

Further. “The scientific laboratory is a united collective,
acting co-ordinately, concertedly and consciously in all its
elements.”

Untrue. This cannot be the case before the abolition of
classes.

This is not scientific but sentimental: before classes have
been abolished, “share and share alike” in everything.
Wrong. It will degenerate into the practices of 1918: medical
assistants demand that doctors should “share and share
alike” in everything (scientific).

This is both wrong and practically harmful.

An example: the Political Bureau and its girl secretaries.
“Share and share alike” in everything (scientific)! You
yourself will not insist on that. You have been carried away.

Best greetings!

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin refers to the following passage: “...in the first place, it
does not have at its disposal well-qualified specialists of the most
diverse categories”.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin refers to the article by I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, “Chto
takoye spets i kak yego delayut” (“What a Specialist Is and How
He Is Made”), published in Pravda No. 244, October 28, 1922.





[3]
Reference is to the following passage from the article by
Skvortsov-Stepanov: “Here, too, the class struggle must develop, the
struggle between socialism and ‘capitalist craftsmanship’ or ‘
craftsmen’s capitalism’, more likely the latter. After what has been said
the reader will not be surprised by the abnormality of this phrase.
It is no more abnormal than the real relations which it expresses.”

Supplementing your report at the Fourth Congress of
the Comintern, I should like in a few words to point out the
significance of the organisation of aid.

The assistance given to the starving by the international
working class helped Soviet Russia in considerable measure
to endure the painful days of last year’s famine and to
overcome it. At the present time we have to heal the wounds
inflicted by the famine, provide in the first place for many
thousands of orphaned children, and restore our agriculture
and industry which have suffered heavily as a result of the
famine.

In this sphere, too, the fraternal aid of the international
working class has already begun to operate. The American
tractor column near Perm, the agricultural groups of the
American Technical Aid, the agricultural and industrial
undertakings of the International Workers’ Aid, the
allocation of and subscriptions to the first proletarian loan, through
the Workers’ Aid to Soviet Russia—all these are very
promising beginnings in the cause of workers’ fraternal aid to
promote the economic restoration of Soviet Russia.

The work of economic assistance, so happily begun by
the International Workers’ Aid to Soviet Russia, should be
supported in every possible way by the workers and toilers
of the whole world. Side by side with the continuing strong
political pressure on the governments of the bourgeois
countries over the demand for recognition of the Soviet
government, widespread economic aid by the world proletariat is at

    

present the best and most practical support of Soviet Russia
in her difficult economic war against the imperialist concerns,
and the best support for her work of building a socialist
economy.

[1]
International Workers’ Aid—an international proletarian
organisation, set up in 1921 to help the population of the parts of Soviet
Russia which in 1921 were struck by famine because of the bad
harvest. Its chairman was Clara Zetkin, and its General Secretary,
Willi Münzenborg. International Workers’ Aid was active in
collecting money, provisions and medical supplies, organising
children’s homes, etc. In 1922 the I.W.A. launched a number of
industrial and agricultural projects in Soviet Russia to promote her
economic rehabilitation. The I.W.A. later grew into a powerful
organisation, which rendered great assistance to the international
working-class movement.
