Romagnolo, the editor and publisher of the Marx2Mao website (www.marx2mao.com), who scanned and created this superb series of facsimiles. [Web viewing versions in HTML are presented and linked on the right]
David claimed a copyright on the presentation (not the content) of these digital incarnations of Lenin's works, but admitted himself that he isn't sure whether such a claim has legal standing.  In fact, he is right to express doubt about this.  The law and court precedent is quite unambiguously clear here:  "slavish reproductions" of public domain works (such as the collected works of Lenin)... whether they be photographic bit map scans, or the meticulously re-type-set digital files David produced...  CAN NOT be claimed to be owned by anyone.  
As always, we at Marxists Internet Archive encourage the widest possible distribution and sharing of the materials we archive, but, while we share Dave's wish this material be distributed freely, and without charge, the fact is that under the existing bourgeois intellectual property law neither David, nor we, nor anyone else, actually, have the legal right to restrict how this material is used or re-distributed. 
We thank David J. Romagnolo for his years of work meticulously re-creating a stunningly high resolution, re-type-set digital archive of Lenin's Collected Works  – making this was an outstanding service to the workers movement – and we encourage users to remember to credit David J.

Lenin 
      Collected Works: Volume 37: Preface by Progress Publishers




Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 37
Preface by
      Progress Publishers

    This volume contains 274 personal letters, telegrams and notes
    from Vladimir Ilyich Lenin to his relatives. They were written
    between 1893 and 1922, to his mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,
    his sisters, Anna and Maria, his brother, Dmitry, his
    brother-in-law, Mark Timofeyevich Yelizarov (husband of Anna
    Ulyanova), and his wife, Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya.
  

    Many of these letters were published in the journal
      Proletarskaya Revolyatsiya for the years 1924,
      1929 and 1930 and in Lenin Miscellanies Nos. III,
      XXIV, XXV, XXXV; separate editions of the Letters to
      Relatives, edited by Lenin’s sisters, were published
      in 1930, 1931 and 1934.
  

    The Preface to the 1930 edition by Maria Ulyanova and the
    article by Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova, “Apropos of
    Lenin’s Letters to Relatives”, which formed the
    preface to the 1931 and 1934 editions, discuss the content
    and significance of the letters; these two articles precede
    the letters in the present volume.
  

    Lenin wrote to his mother and to other relatives at least
    once in every week or ten days. The longer intervals between
    letters in this volume show that a considerable number of
    letters have been lost. Most of Lenin’s letters were written
    before the revolution, a time when his relatives were subjected
to frequent house searches and arrests. Many of his
    letters fell into the hands of the secret police and bear
    traces of their examination—passages of interest to
    the police are underlined in red pencil, etc. Some of the
    letters seized during searches were not returned, some were
    found after the revolution in police dossiers; only odd
    pages of some letters have survived. Many letters were lost
    during the First World War (1914-1917), when letters from abroad
    were subjected to a particularly strict scrutiny by the
    censors.
  

    The periods best represented are the late nineties, when
    Lenin was writing his Economic Studies and Essays
    and The Development of Capitalism in Russia, and
    the years 1908-09 when he was preparing his Materialism
    and Empirio criticism; in these years Lenin’s letters
    concerned the despatch to him of the literature he needed,
    and contained instructions on how the books should be
    published and on correction of the proofs.
  

    Almost all the letters are printed from the originals; in a
    few cases, however, they have been printed from copies in
    the files of the Police Department in the form (in full or
    as extracts) in which they were found there.
  

    Eleven of the letters were published for the first time in
    the Fourth Russian Edition of the Collected Works,
    from which the translation of this volume has been made
    (these letters are marked with an asterisk in the table of
    contents).
  

    In the letter to his mother dated July 1, 1912, Lenin
    mentions that he is moving from Paris to Krakow. This change
    of address was necessary to bring him closer to
    St. Petersburg, the centre of the working-class movement, so
    that he could improve contacts with Pravda and with
    the Bolshevik group in the Fourth Duma, and carry out the
    day-to-day work involved in his guidance of the Party
    organisations. In his letter of July 15, 1919, addressed to
    the propaganda boat Krasnaya Zvezda, Lenin informed
    his wife of the situation obtaining on the Eastern
    Front—the capture of Yekaterinburg (now
    Sverdlovsk)—and also of the great change then taking
    place in the South.
  

    Among the items first published in the Fourth Edition are
    some brief notes addressed to his wife and to his sister
    Maria between 1919 and 1922.
  

    Fifty-four letters addressed by Lenin’s wife to his mother
    and sisters are given as an Appendix to this volume; these
    letters describe Lenin’s way of life when he was in exile in
    Siberia and when he was living abroad and help to elucidate
    certain facts mentioned in Lenin’s letters; eight of
    Krupskaya’s letters were published for the first time in
    the Fourth Russian Edition of the Collected Works.
    These are also marked with an asterisk in the table of
    contents. Letters written jointly by Lenin and his wife are
    contained in the body of the volume.
  

    The items are arranged chronologically; letters posted in
    Russia are dated according to the Old Style, those from
    abroad according to the New Style; the editors have added
    dates at the end of undated letters. The source and destination
of the letter and, where necessary, the date are indicated
by the editors at the end of each letter; below this,
    information is given on where the letter was first published
    in Russian. It should be borne in mind that the note on
    printing given on the right of the page refers always to the
    Russian original, not to the translation.
  

    The volume is furnished with a name index, a list of
    literature mentioned in the letters, and explanatory notes.
  

    The illustrations include photographs of Lenin’s relatives
    and some of the places where he lived. Facsimiles of two of
    Lenin’s letters are also given.

      The letters in this collection are addressed mainly to Lenin’s
      mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, and to

      me[1]

      and cover the period from 1894 to 

      1917,[2]

      i.e., they begin from the first years of Lenin’s revolutionary
      activities and continue up to his return to Russia after the February
      Revolution. It was in this period, almost a quarter of a century, that our
      Party emerged and took shape. Through out this remarkable period of
      twenty-five years, Vladimir Ilyich stood at the head of the Party, guiding
      and nurturing it. His entire life was one of revolutionary struggle and
      his private life was part of that struggle, part of his labour on behalf
      of the cause of the proletariat.
    

      We have a complete edition of Lenin’s Collected Works and a
      fairly extensive literature on Leninism (works of

      
      
      scientific research and popular writings) but Lenin the man, with his
      brilliant, all-round individuality, has been but little described or,
      rather, has scarcely been described at all.
    

      The letters here offered to the reader to some extent fill this
      gap. They enable the reader to form to some extent a picture of
      Lenin’s life, his habits, inclinations, attitude to people, etc. We
      say here “to some extent”, mainly because the collection of
      letters to his relatives in this period is far from complete. During the
      frequent moves from town to town, the numerous house searches and arrests
      to which first one, then another member of our family was subjected, many
      of the letters fell into the hands of the police and were not

      returned[3]

      or were lost in some other way. There were also frequent cases of letters
      going astray in the post, especially during the imperialist war. For this
      reason one and the same question is repeated in a number of successive
      letters. These letters, furthermore, bear the imprint of police conditions
      in tsarist times. It is true that all our official correspondence (all
      communications concerning revolutionary events, party life, etc.) was
      conducted secretly, in invisible ink and usually in books and journals,
      sent through other, “clean” 

      addresses.[4]

      Our personal lives were so closely bound up with revolutionary work that
      our legal, personal correspondence no doubt suffered badly and we cut it
      down because of police conditions. Vladimir Ilyich had good reason to
      write to me, when I was in exile in Vologda, that “as far as
      letter-writing is concerned—At is very difficult in our situation
      (in yours and mine especially) to carry on the correspondence one would

      like”.[Letter
No. 252.—Ed.]


      This applied equally to all our family and not only to me, because
      Vladimir Ilyich was not only a blood relation but was related to us by his
      views and convictions. All

      


      the family (including Anna’s husband, Mark Yelizarov) were at that
      time Social-Democrats, supported the revolutionary wing of the Party, took
      a greater or lesser part in revolutionary activities, were keenly
      interested in the life of the Party and were delighted at its successes
      and grieved by its failures. Even our mother, who was born in 1835 and who
      was over sixty at the end of the century, when house searches and arrests
      became particularly frequent, showed full sympathy for our revolutionary
      activities. All the legal correspondence of revolutionaries was examined
      by the police and recourse had to be made to various hints, secret signs,
      etc., in some way to touch upon questions that interested us, confirm the
      receipt of some illegal letter, make enquiries about acquaintances and so
      on.
    

      The reader will notice that letters sent by Vladimir Ilyich to his mother,
      sisters or brother contain scarcely any names, because the use of names
      might involve those mentioned in unpleasantness. It stands to reason that
      we had not the slightest desire to do anything that would, at best, make
      things unpleasant for someone. The names and surnames that do, on rare
      occasions, occur in Vladimir Ilyich’s letters are those of comrades
      and friends whose connection with us was in any case known to the police
      owing to various circumstances (exile together on the same charge,
      attendance at the same educational establishment, etc.) or had to do with
      purely business matters (names of publishers, booksellers, etc.). To avoid
      mentioning the names of any body living in more or less legal conditions
      about whom Vladimir Ilyich wanted to tell us something, to whom he wanted
      to send regards, etc., he made frequent use in his letters of nicknames
      and explanations connected with facts or events known to us. Vladimir
      Ilyich called Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, for instance, “the
      historian” (in view of his writings on history); at one time he
      carried on a lively correspondence with him through my sister and

      me.[5]




      When he sent greetings to V. V. Vorovsky, who was in exile in Vologda at
      the same time as I, Vladimir Ilyich wrote “Greetings to Polish
      friends, and I hope they help you in every 

      way.”[Letter No. 237.—Ed.]

      By “China traveller” he meant A. P. Sklyarenko, who was
      employed on the railway in Manchuria at the time, and “the gentleman
      we went boating with last

      year"[Letters Nos. 114 and 130.—Ed.]

      was V. A. Levitsky, etc.
    

      The despatch of underground publications, secret correspondence, books
      containing letters in invisible ink, etc., had to be referred to in
      Aesopian language, etc.
    

      At the end of December 1900 I gave G. B. Krasin, who was going abroad, the
      Manifesto of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries to take to
      Vladimir Ilyich; for purposes of secrecy I concealed it in an album of
      photographs. Vladimir Ilyich was very pleased with this package and wrote
      in a letter dated January 16, 1901, “many thanks to Manyasha for the
      books she sent, and especially for the unusually beautiful and interesting
      photographs from our cousin in Vienna; I should like to receive such gifts
      more

      often”.[Letter No. 120.—Ed.]


Iskra and other underground publications were sent to Russia in
      envelopes to “clean”, legal addresses. We also used these
      addresses to obtain literature for ourselves. Information concerning such
      packages was sometimes contained in legal letters to enable us to make
      enquiries of the addressee in good time. Information of this kind seems to
      be contained in Vladimir Ilyich’s statement (letter of December 14,
      1900), “I remember that I sent you the things that interested you on
      the ninth.” And in her letter of February 8, 1916, Nadezhda
      Konstantinovna wrote, “Volodya was very pleased with your big
      letter. Perhaps you will write

      again.”[Letter No. 117 and Krupskaya’s
Letter No. 54.—Ed.]

      Since our legal letters were never exceptionally long and during the
      imperialist war, when this letter was written, we corresponded mainly by
      postcard, even registered postcards, and since many letters were lost in
      transit, the words quoted apparently refer to an illegal letter concealed
      in a book.
    



      When Vladimir Ilyich was first living abroad in 1900 and still did not
      know whether his stay would be more or less permanent, he did not give us
      his private address; when he was living in Switzerland or in Munich we
      wrote to him in Paris or Prague for reasons of secrecy. In his letter of
      March 2, 1901, for instance, he sent us his new address, adding “I
      have moved together with my

      landlord”.[Letter
No. 125.—Ed.] 

      Franz Modráček, to whose address we sent our letters,
      actually did move at that time to a new apartment, but Vladimir Ilyich
      remained in Munich in the old one.
    
___

      Characteristic of Vladimir Ilyich were his great punctuality and
      thoroughness and his strict economy in spending money, especially on
      himself. Vladimir Ilyich probably inherited these qualities from our
      mother, whom he resembled in many ways. Our mother was of German descent
      on her mother’s side and these qualities were deeply ingrained in
      her character.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich’s carefulness with money and his frugality in
      spending it on himself can be seen from his letter of October 5,

      1895.[6]


      “I am now, for the first time in St. Petersburg, keeping a cash-book
      to see how much I actually spend. It turned out that for the month August
      28 to September 27 I spent altogether 54 rubles 30 kopeks, not including
      payment for things (about 10 rubles) and expenses for a court case (also
      about 10 rubles) which I shall probably conduct. It is true that part of
      this 54 rubles was spent on things that do not have to be bought every
      month (galoshes, clothes, books, an abacus, etc.), but even discounting
      that (16 rubles), the expenditure is still excessive—38 rubles in a
      month. Obviously I have not been living carefully; in one month I have
      spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the horse trains, for instance. When I get
      used to the place I shall probably spend less.”
    

      He really did live economically, especially when he was not earning
      anything and had recourse to “philanthropy”,

      

      as he called his mother’s financial aid. He economised to such an
      extent that he did not even subscribe to Russkiye

Vedomosti[7] 

      for himself when he was living in St. Peters burg in 1893, but read the
      paper in the Public Library when it was “two weeks
      old”. “When I get a job here perhaps I will subscribe to
      it,” he wrote to

      me.[Letter No. 2.—Ed.]


      Vladimir Ilyich retained this trait all his life and it made itself felt,
      not only in Russia when he was not earning anything and when he was abroad
      and could not find a publisher for his literary works (one has only to
      recall that The Agrarian Question was lying about for ten whole
      years and saw the light of day only in 1917) and was thus in a critical
      position (see, for instance, his letter to Comrade Shlyapnikov of
      September 

      1916[Collected Works, Vol. 35,
p. 236.—Ed.]),  

      but also when he was materially well provided for, i.e., after the 1917
      Revolution.
    

      There was one thing, however, that Vladimir Ilyich found it difficult to
      economise on—books. He needed them for his work, so that he could
      keep himself up-to-date on foreign and Russian politics, economics, etc.
    

      “To my great horror,” he wrote in a letter to his mother, sent
      from Berlin August 29, 1895, “I see that I am again in financial
      ’difficulties‘; the ’temptation’ to buy books,
      etc., is so great that the devil alone knows where the money

      goes.”[Letter No. 10.—Ed.]

      Even in this, however, he tried to cut down, mainly by going to work in
      libraries, especially as they provided him with a quieter working
      atmosphere when he was abroad—there was none of the hubbub and
      endless, wearisome talk that was so typical of the exiles, who were bored
      by surroundings unusual and alien to them, and who liked to unburden
      themselves in conversation.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich used libraries not only when he was living abroad but also
      in Russia. In a letter to his mother from St. Petersburg he wrote that he
      was satisfied with his new room, which was “not far from the centre
      (only some 15 minutes’ walk from the

      library)”.[Letter No. 1.—Ed.]

      Passing through

      

      Moscow on his way to his place of exile he even made use of the few days
      he was in the city to work in the library of the Rumyantsev Museum. When
      he was living in Krasnoyarsk and had to await the start of the navigation
      season to continue his way to Minusinsk Uyezd, he worked in Yudin’s
      library, and had to walk about 5 versts every day to do so.
    

      During the period of banishment, when there was no possibility of using a
      library, Vladimir Ilyich tried to make up for this by asking us to arrange
      for library books to be sent him by post. A few experiments of this sort
      were made but too much time was wasted (about a month there and back) and
      library books were issued for a restricted period.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich resorted to this method at a later date, too. In a letter
      to his sister Anna dated February 11, 

      1914,[8]

      he wrote: “With regard to the summaries of crime statistics for
      1905-1908, I would ask you not to buy them (there is no need, they are
      expensive) but to get them from a library (either the Bar Council or the
      Duma Library) and send them for a month.”
    

      When he was living abroad Vladimir Ilyich also made constant use of
      libraries. In Berlin he worked in the Imperial Library. In Geneva there
      was his favourite “club” (Société de lecture),
      where he had to become a member and pay certain dues—very small
      ones, to be sure—in order to work in the “club’s”
      library. In Paris he worked in the Bibliothéque nationale, although
      he complained that it was “badly organised”; in London he
      worked in the British Museum. And only when he was living in Munich did he
      complain that “there is no library here”; in Krakow, too, he
      made but little use of the library. In his letter to me of April 22, 1914
      he wrote that “here (in Krakow. — M.U.) the library
      is a bad one and extremely inconvenient, although I scarcely ever have to
      go there....” His work for the newspaper (Pravda), all
      sorts of dealings with comrades, who came to Krakow in greater numbers
      than to France or Switzerland, his guidance of the activities of the
      Social-Democratic group in the Duma, Party conferences and meetings, etc.,

      

      required so much effort that there was little time left for scientific
      studies. Even then, however, Vladimir Ilyich “often thought of
      Geneva, where work went better, the library was convenient, and life was
      less nerve-racking and 

      time-wasting”.[Letter
No. 252.—Ed.]


      After his arrest in Galicia at the beginning of the imperialist war
      Vladimir Ilyich again went to Switzerland; from there he wrote “the
      libraries here are good, and I have made quite decent arrangements as far
      as the use of books is concerned. It is even pleasant to read after my
      daily news paper

      work”.[Letter No. 254.—Ed.] 

      Later he went with his wife from Berne to Zurich in order, among other
      things, “to work in the libraries here” (continuing, however,
      the same intensive Party political work, as his correspondence in that
      period with Comrades Karpinsky and Ravich, just published in Lenin
      Miscellany XI, clearly 

      illustrates[9]) 

      which, according to him, were “much better than those in
      Berne”. But although Vladimir Ilyich was better off abroad as
      regards the reading of foreign books, journals and newspapers— he
      visited libraries for this purpose—the shortage of Russian books
      made itself sharply felt. “I can easily get German books here, there
      is no shortage of them-. But there is a shortage of Russian books,” he
      wrote in a letter dated April 2, 

      1902.[Letter No. 137.—Ed.]

      “I see very few new books”, he wrote on April 6, 1900. There
      is no doubt that Vladimir Ilyich’s work was greatly hampered by his
      frequently not having the necessary book to hand when he lived
      abroad. This is why his letters to his relatives frequently contained
      requests for certain books that he needed for his work (statistics, books
      on the agrarian question, on philosophy, etc.) and also new publications,
      journals and fiction. And again, it is possible to judge, to some
      extent, what branches of knowledge he was interested in and needed
      literature about at any given time, and for which writings he used them.
    

      Among this literature considerable attention was paid to various
      statistical returns.
    



      From his works, and from the rough copies, notes and calculations that
      preceded those works we see clearly what great importance Vladimir Ilyich
      attached to statistics, to “precise facts, indisputable

      facts”.[Collected Works, Vol. 23,
p. 272.—Ed.] 

      His unfinished and as yet unpublished article
      “Statistics and Sociology” by P. Piryuchev (a new pen-name
      that Vladimir Ilyich adopted to facilitate the publication of this work)
      is typical in this respect; it is devoted to the question of “the
      role and significance of national movements, the relationship between the
      national and the 

      international”.[Ibid.,
p. 271.—Ed.]


      The following passage is from this article: “The most widely used,
      and most fallacious, method in the realm of social phenomena is to tear
      out individual minor facts and juggle with examples. Selecting
      chance examples presents no difficulty at all, but is of no value, or of
      purely negative value, for in each individual case everything hinges on
      the historically concrete situation. Facts, if we take them in their
      totality, in their interconnection, are not only stub
      born things, but undoubtedly proof-bearing things. Minor facts, if taken
      out of their totality, out of their interconnection, if they are
      arbitrarily selected and torn out of context, are merely things for
      juggling with, or even worse.... We must seek to build a reliable
      foundation of precise and indisputable facts that can be set against any
      of the general’ or ’example-based’ arguments now so
      grossly misused in certain countries. And if it is to be a real
      foundation, we must take not individual facts, but the sum total
      of facts, without a single exception, relating to the question
      under discussion. Otherwise there will be the inevitable, and fully
      justified, suspicion that the facts were selected or compiled arbitrarily,
      that instead of historical phenomena being presented in objective
      interconnection and inter dependence and treated as a whole, we are
      presenting a ’subjective’ concoction to justify what might
      prove to be a dirty business. This does happen ... and more often than one
      might

      think.”[Ibid.,
pp. 272-73.—Ed.]


      In 1902, Vladimir Ilyich asked for “all the

      statistics”,[10]


      from among the books he had had with him in Siberia, to be sent to him
      abroad, for, as he said in a letter dated April 2, 1902, “I am
      beginning to miss these things”. Later, in order to get statistical
      material from various towns and to get it more regularly, Vladimir Ilyich
      wrote a special

      appeal[11]

      to statisticians participating in the Congress of Doctors and Naturalists
      (there was a sub-section for statisticians at this congress) held in
      Moscow in the winter of 1909. A number of provincial statisticians
      responded and in a letter dated January 2, 1910, Vladimir Ilyich wrote,
      “I have also received a letter about statistics from Ryazan—it
      is splendid that I shall probably be getting help from many 

      people."[Letter No. 200.—Ed.]


      In 1908, when Vladimir Ilyich was working on his Materialism and
Empirio-criticism, he ordered a book by Professor Chelpanov about
Avenarius and his school, the book Immanent Philosophy and
others. He wrote to me about this work of his, “I have been doing
a lot of work on the Machists and I think I have sorted out all their
inexpressible vulgarities (and those of ’empirio-monism’ as

      well).”[Letter
No. 166.—Ed.]


      When Vladimir Ilyich inquired whether his manuscript about the latest form
      of capitalism (Imperialism, the Highest Stage of 

Capitalism)[Collected Works, Vol. 22,
pp. 185-304.—Ed.] 

      had been received he wrote, “I regard this work on economics as
      being of exceptionally great importance and would especially like to see
      it in print in full” (letter of October 22, 

      1916).[Letter No. 260.—Ed.]

      As we know, this wish was not fulfilled (although Vladimir Ilyich
      “did his utmost to adapt himself to the
      ’restrictions‘”, as he wrote in a letter to
      M. N. Pokrovskyon July 2,

      1916);[Collected Works, Vol. 35,
p. 227.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich’s work underwent a large number of changes and many

      

      cuts were made, and only ten years later was it published in its original
      form. 
    

      From Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives we see in what
      connection he set about writing his (as yet unpublished) article
      “The Capitalist System of Modern

      Agriculture”.[Collected Works, Vol. 46,
pp. 423-46.—Ed.] 

      In a letter dated October 22, 1916, he wrote to me, “You write that
      the publisher wants to put out The Agrarian Question as a book
      and not as a pamphlet. I under stand that to mean that I must send him the
      continuation (i.e., in addition to what I have written about America I
      must write what I have promised about Germany). I will start on this as
      soon as I have finished what I have to write to cover the advance received
      from the old

      publisher.”[Letter
No. 260.—Ed.] 

      The manuscript of this work, which is now in the possession of the
      Institute, is unfinished; apparently the revolution “hindered”
      Vladimir Ilyich and he could not finish it.
    

      The letters here presented to the reader give something of a picture of
      the conditions under which Vladimir Ilyich carried on his literary work,
      and also of those trials he had to undergo to publish the results of that
      work. I am refer ring here to what he published legally. Vladimir Ilyich
      worked in unfavourable conditions throughout the entire pre-revolutionary
      period (with the exception of the period of the first revolution and the
      Zvezda and Pravda period— 1912-14—when he
      was able to contribute to the legal press and when we had, for a short
      time, at least, our own legal publishers); this was while he was abroad
      and experienced, for instance, a great shortage of Russian books and other
      material needed for his work.
    

      Censorship conditions also created considerable difficulty; Vladimir
      Ilyich’s articles were cut and distorted (like his article
      “Uncritical Criticism”, for instance) or were confiscated
      (The Agrarian Question, Vol. II), and so on and so forth. Great
      difficulties were also caused by lack of contact with Russia, because of
      which it was frequently impossible to establish direct communications with
      publishers, etc. Typical of the situation are his frequent attempts to
      obtain work for Granat’s Encyclopaedic Dictionary. “I would
      like

      

      to get some work for the Encyclopaedic Dictionary,” he wrote to me in his
      letter of December 22, 1914, “but it is probably not easy to arrange
      unless you have an opportunity to meet the secretary of the editorial

      board."[Letter No. 254.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich had no such opportunity, and when he
      applied directly to the Granat office he either received no answer at all,
      or received one only after a considerable delay. “Is it possible to
      obtain some more work for the Encyclopaedic Dictionary?” he wrote to me in
      1915. “I have written to the secretary about this but he has not
      answered 

      me.”[12]

      “In this place, unfortunately, I am cut off from all contact with
      publishers,” he wrote in 

      1912.[Letter No. 230.—Ed.]


      If it had not been for the great help from comrades and relatives in
      seeking publishers, reading the proofs of his works, etc., there would
      have been even greater difficulties in getting his writings published. But
      we, his sisters and brother, were not always in a position to help him in
      these matters, especially when we were in prison or in exile. In 1904, for
      instance, he asked mother to give him the address of Anna’s husband,
      Mark Timofeyevich, for whom he had some “literary business”
      (letter of January 20,

      1904).[Letter No. 150.—Ed.]


      Vladimir Ilyich, however, not only had the ability to work systematically,
      persistently and fruitfully, he also had the ability to rest—when
      the opportunity offered. For him the best form of rest was out in the
      open, close to nature and away from people. “Here (in Stjernsund in
      Finland, where he was resting after returning “terribly tired”
      from the Fifth Party Congress.—M.U.) you can have a
      wonderful rest, swimming, walking, no people and no work. No people and no
      work—that is the best thing for 

      me.”[Letter No. 155.—Ed.]

      He enjoyed a really excellent rest there, where Lidiya Mikhailovna
      Knipovich surrounded him with

      

      exceptional care and attention, and he recalled it in a letter to me when
      I had just got over a bad attack of enteric fever. “Now would be
      the time to send you to Stjernsund,” he 

      wrote.[Letter No. 164.—Ed.]


      Vladimir Ilyich was extremely fond of nature and in his letters one
      constantly comes across references to the beauties of nature, no matter
      where he happens to be. “The scenery here is splendid, I am enjoying
      it all the time. The Alps began immediately after the little German
      station I wrote to you from; then came the lakes and I could not tear
      myself away from the window of the railway carriage,” he wrote to
      mother when he was on his way to Switzerland in 1895. And again he wrote
      to mother, “I take walks— walking is not at all bad here at
      present and, it seems, there are plenty of nice places in Pskov (and also
      in its environs).” From abroad he wrote, “I saw Anyuta a few
      days ago, took a trip on a very beautiful lake with her and enjoyed the
      wonderful views and the good weather.” “A few days ago I had a
      wonderful outing to Salève with Nadya and a friend. Down below in
      Geneva it was all mist and gloom, but up on the mountain (about 4,000 feet
      above sea level) there was glorious sunshine, snow, tobogganing—
      altogether a good Russian winter’s day. And at the foot of the
      mountain—la mer du brouillard, a veritable sea of mist and
      clouds, concealing everything except the mountains jutting up through it,
      and only the highest at that. Even little Salève (nearly 3,000
      feet) was wrapped in mist.” “Nadya and I have travelled and
      walked round a great deal of the surrounding country and have found some
      very nice places,” we read in a letter dated September 27,
      1902. Vladimir Ilyich was probably right when he wrote, “We are the
      only people among the comrades here who are exploring every bit
      of the surrounding country. We discover various ’rural’ paths,
      we know all the places nearby and intend to go further

      afield.”[Letters Nos. 6,103, 110, 149, 142,
148.—Ed.]


      If they were unable to get out of town for the summer and drop straight
      into “rural life” (“we get up early and go to bed almost
      with the

      roosters”),[Letter No. 237.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich

      

      and Nadezhda Konstantinovna, when they were living in Switzerland,
      sometimes went walking in the mountains. There is a description of one
      such journey in a letter Nadezhda Konstantinovna wrote to my mother on
      July 2, 1904. “It is already a week since we got away from Geneva
      and are now resting in the full sense of the word. We have left our work
      and our worries in Geneva and here we sleep ten hours a day, and go
      swimming and walking—Volodya does not even read the newspapers
      properly; we took a minimum of books with us, and even those we are
      sending back to Geneva tomorrow, unread, while we ourselves shall don our
      rucksacks at four in the morning and set out for a two weeks’
      walking tour in the mountains. We shall go to Interlaken and from there to
      Lucerne. We are reading Baedeker and planning our journey
      carefully.... Volodya and I have made an agreement not to talk about our
      work—work, he says, is not a bear and will not escape to the
      woods—not even to mention it, and, as far as possible, not to think
      about

      it.”[Letter No. 151.—Ed.]


      Such journeys, however, were rare and were undertaken only when work and
      the factional squabbling had had too bad an effect on health and on
      nerves, as was the case in the winter of 1903-04 after the Second Party
      Congress and the split. As a rule, if Vladimir Ilyich went to the country
      for the summer, he continued his work there, whenever it was possible,
      after a few days’ complete rest. If it was impossible to get out of
      town, or if such trips were too short, they made excursions to the
      country, sometimes to the mountains, on foot or on their bicycles, usually
      on Sundays. “Quite unintentionally we are taking to foreign ways and
      arrange our outings on Sundays of all days, though that is the worst time
      because everywhere is crowded,” Lenin wrote in a letter to his
      mother (March 29,

      1903).[Letter No. 148.—Ed.]

      On such outings they usually took sandwiches with them instead? of having
      lunch and set off for the whole day. No wonder Vladimir Ilyich and
      Nadezhda Konstantinovna belonged to the “excursionist” party
      while other comrades formed the “cinemist” party (those who
      liked the cinema), as they jokingly called themselves.
    


      
      Vladimir Ilyich was, indeed, not very fond of the different amusements in
      which other comrades found relaxation after hard work. I do not think he
      ever went to the cinema, especially when he was living abroad, and he
      visited theatres only on rare occasions. He went to see The
      Weavers when he was in Berlin on his first trip abroad, and he went
      to the theatre when he was living abroad in exile, mostly, however, when
      he was living there “somewhat alone” (i.e., without his
      family), or when he happened to be in a big city on business after a
      period of intensive work and he took advantage of the trip to “snap
      out of himself”. The theatres abroad gave Vladimir Ilyich little
      satisfaction (at times he and Nadezhda Konstantinovna left the theatre
      after the first act , on which occasions their comrades jokingly accused
      them of wasting money), and of the plays he saw in the later period, only
      The Living Corpse created an impression on him. He liked the
      Moscow Art Theatre very much, however; he had been there with Lalayants
      (“Columbus”) before he went abroad, when he was staying in
      Moscow, and in a letter to his mother in February 1901 he said that
      “he still remembers with pleasure” that visit to the
      theatre. But what we would like would be to visit the Russian Art Theatre
      and see The Lower 

Depths,”[Letter
No. 146.—Ed.] 

      we read in his letter of February 4, 1903. He did not manage to see
      The Lower Depths until many years later, when he was living in
      Moscow after the revolution.
    

      His visits to concerts were also relatively rare, although he loved
      music. “We recently went to our first concert this winter”, we
      read in the same letter, “and were very pleased with
      it—especially Chaikovsky’s latest symphony (Symphonie
      pathetique).” “I was at the opera a few days ago and
      heard La Juive with the greatest pleasure; I had heard it once in
      Kazan (when Zakrzhevsky sang)—that must be thirteen years ago, and
      some of the tunes have remained in my memory,” he wrote to mother on
      February 9,

      19O1.[Letter No. 422.—Ed.]

      After wards he often whistled those tunes (he had his own peculiar
      way of whistling through his teeth). Later, during his life abroad,
      Vladimir Ilyich rarely visited concerts or operas.

      

      Music had too powerful an effect on his nerves, and when they were upset,
      as was often the case in the turmoil of life among the
      émigrés abroad, it affected him badly. Vladimir Ilyich was
      always very busy and his budget was a modest one and this had its effect
      on his secluded (as far as amusements were concerned) way of life.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich paid relatively little attention to the various sights:
      “I have little taste for such things in general and in most cases
      have seen them only by accident. In general, I much prefer Wandering
      around and seeing the evening amusements and pastimes of the people to
      visiting museums, theatres, shopping centres, 

      etc.”[Letter No. 40.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich usually did his “wandering around” in the
      evenings when he was living in Berlin in 1895, and this enabled him to
      study “the Berlin mores and listen to German 

      speech”.[Ibid.]

      It was not, however, only when he was in Berlin on his first trip abroad
      that he made a study of customs; there are quite a number of passages in
      his letters to his relatives which show that when he was living in Paris,
      or was there on a short trip, he found pleasure in examining the local way
      of life and he remarked the free and easy manner of the public in the
      streets and on the boulevards. “Paris is a very inconvenient town
      for a man of modest means to live in, and very tiring,” he wrote after
      spending a few days in that city. “But there is no better and more
      lively town to stay in for a short time, just for a visit, for an

      outing.”[Letter
No. 249.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich also studied Czech life when he was passing through
      Czechoslovakia and was sorry that he had not learned the Czech language;
      he gave a lively description of the manners and customs of the Galician
      peasants that he had an opportunity of observing when he was living in
      Galicia, and of the carnival in the Munich streets with its battles of
      confetti and streamers, etc. He loved life in all its forms and had a rare
      talent for observing and studying it on a broad scale.
    

      The letters published here give a picture of Vladimir Ilyich’s
      attitude towards his relatives and, to some extent, his feelings for
      people in general. How, much care and

      

      attention is displayed in those letters! Vladimir Ilyich was greatly
      attached to his relatives, especially to mother, and in all his letters,
      in those addressed to other members of our family as well as to mother,
      there is always a note of solicitude for her, the wish that things should
      go better for her and that she should have a more peaceful and comfortable
      life. His letters are full of questions about health, whether good
      arrangements have been made for an apartment, whether it is not
      cold. “I am worried that your apartment is so cold; what will it be
      like in winter if the temperature is only 12° now? You must not catch
      cold.... Is there nothing you can do? Perhaps you should put in a small
      stove,” he wrote in a letter to his mother in 

      1909.[Letter No. 198.—Ed.]

      These letters contain a great deal of advice to “have a good rest in
      sum mer”, “run about less, rest more and keep well”,
      etc.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich was particularly attentive to his mother at those times
      when some misfortune overtook her, and misfortunes were many in her
      life. First one, then another member of our family was arrested and
      exiled, sometimes several of us were arrested at the same time and she,
      though advanced in years, had to go again and again to prisons to visit
      her family and take things to them, to sit for hours in the waiting-rooms
      of the gendarmerie and the secret police, and was often left completely
      alone with her heart aching for her children who had been deprived of
      their liberty. How worried Vladimir Ilyich was at such times, and how
      heavily the lack of personal contact with his mother weighed upon him, can
      be seen from his letter of September 1, 1901. At that time my
      brother-in-law, Mark Yelizarov, and I were in prison, my sister Anna was
      abroad and could not return to Russia because she would have been arrested
      on the same charge, and our brother Dmitry could not remain with mother
      because he had to graduate from the University of Yuriev. She was left
      alone in the same way in a strange town in 1904 when my sister, my brother
      Dmitry and I were arrested on charges connected with the Kiev Party
      Committee and the Central Committee.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich always wanted mother to live with him, and he frequently
      invited her to do so. This was difficult

      

      to arrange, however, because mother was always with those of her children
      who were particularly in need of her help, and in Russia that help was
      needed almost always by those who had fallen into the hands of the
      police. And so it turned out that each time Vladimir Ilyich was living in
      exile abroad, both the first and the second time, she was able to stay
      abroad only for a very short while to see him. In 1902, she lived for
      about a month with Vladimir Ilyich and our sister Anna at Loguivy in the
      north of France. The second time, and this was the last time she was to
      see her son, was in Stockholm, where she and I went in 1910 specially to
      visit him. Vladimir Ilyich always provided her with detailed itineraries
      for such trips and advised her to stop the night in hotels in order not to
      overtire herself with the journey. It was also in Stockholm that mother
      for the first and last time heard Vladimir Ilyich speak in public; it was
      at a meeting of worker exiles. When we left, Vladimir Ilyich accompanied
      us to the boat—he could not go aboard the vessel because it belonged
      to a Russian company and he might have been arrested on it—and I
      still remember the expression on his face as he stood there looking at
      mother. How much pain there was in his face! He seemed to feel that this
      was the last time he would see her. And so it was. Vladimir Ilyich did not
      see any of his relatives again until he came to Russia after the February
      Revolution, and mother died shortly before it, in July 1916. We did not
      receive the first letter Vladimir Ilyich wrote when he had news of
      mother’s death. The next letter has not survived either, but from
      what I remember of it it showed what a heavy loss it was to him, how much
      pain it caused him, and how tender he was to all of us, who were also
      distressed by our loss.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich also devoted considerable attention to us, his sisters and
      brother, and to Mark Yelizarov; he was always interested to know how we
      were getting on, whether we were earning anything, whether we had had good
      holidays, etc. He tried to get books for us to translate and sometimes
      sent foreign books to us for that purpose, showed an interest in what we
      read and studied, invited us to stay with him, and so on. Vladimir Ilyich
      also displayed a great interest in his comrades, inquired how they were
      getting

      

      on and tried to help them materially as well. He undertook to write
      prefaces for his comrades’ translations, so as to make it easier for
      them to get the books published and thus have an opportunity of earning
      something.
    

      Comrades who are unacquainted with life in exile abroad and with the way
      legal correspondence was carried on under tsarism may think it strange
      that Vladimir Ilyich frequently says in his letters that he is
      “living very quietly”, “peacefully”,
      “modestly” and so on in periods such as that of the
      imperialist war, for instance, when it is obvious from literature and from
      his underground correspondence that he was displaying tremendous energy in
      the struggle against the chauvinism that was influencing most of the
      Social-Democratic parties. It must not be forgotten that at that time
      Vladimir Ilyich could only make his voice heard in the press, and then
      only in a publication that appeared once in several weeks or even in
      several months, and which (like pamphlets) it was difficult to send from
      place to place; he could also speak at small meetings of exiles abroad or
      at small study circles for foreign workers. It stands to reason that such
      opportunities were far too little for Vladimir Ilyich; Nadezhda Krupskaya
      said that at the beginning of the revolution in Russia he created the
      impression of a lion trying to break out of its cage—was not his
      former life in exile abroad and out of contact with Russia, and especially
      during the imperialist war, a cage that greatly restricted him, that did
      not permit him to branch out and could not satisfy him, the natural
      leader, the voice of the people? He was eager for work on a broader scale,
      his was truly the eagerness of the caged lion, and he had to work hard at
      persuading two or three comrades to obtain access to broader masses. And
      for a nature like his was not “sleepy Berne” really too
      “quiet” and movement there too “gradual”?...
    

      In his legal correspondence there are only occasional glimpses of his fury
      against “disgusting opportunists of the most dangerous type”
      and against “extreme vulgarities about voting for credits”,
      etc. Here he was hampered by the censor and one has only to see which
      phrases from his letters (see Appendix, pp. 553-54) “attracted the
      attention” of the gendarmes and secret police and which became
      “material

      

      evidence”, to understand that both he and his relatives were at that time
      in a situation in which it .was very difficult “to carry on the
      correspondence one would 

      like”.[Letter No. 252.—Ed.]


      We had good reason to make the proviso at the beginning of this preface
      that Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives are of significance
      and interest mainly because they provide a picture of him as a man (of
      course that picture is far from complete and, owing to conditions of
      police surveillance, somewhat one-sided). In this respect, it seems to me,
      they constitute a valuable contribution to the literature on Vladimir
      Ilyich, and one can only regret that so many letters to relatives and to
      comrades have been lost. There are other documents, especially his rich
      literary legacy, which speak of Lenin as the leader, the politician, the
      scholar.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich’s second period of exile abroad was particularly
      burdensome to him. When he arrived in Geneva after having lived in and
      near St. Petersburg, it was especially painful to return to the old
      ash-heap. “We have been hanging about this damned Geneva for several
      days now,” he said in a letter to me on January 14, 1908. “It
      is an awful hole, but there is nothing we can do. We shall get used to

      it.”[Letter No. 158.—Ed.] 

      With his customary persistence and energy he got down to
      work, because he could “get used to” any
      conditions. “The only unpleasant thing was the actual moving, which
      was a change for the worse. That, however, was inevitable,” he wrote in
      the next letter to 

      mother.[Letter No. 159.—Ed.]

      And this change from better to worse, this
      absence of the literature he needed for his work and of new books and
      newspapers made itself particularly felt at this time because in
      St. Petersburg he had been able to read all the newspapers and journals
      and keep up-to-date on books. And he asked us to obtain for him “the
      minutes of the Third Duma (the officially published verbatim reports and
      also the announcements, questions and bills brought before the Duma)”, and
      to “send them all, missing nothing”. He was also
      interested in the “programmes, announcements and leaflets of the

      

      Octobrists, the Rights, the Cossack group, etc.” He was deprived of
      these necessary documents, whereas in the Duma “all these
      ’bits of paper’ probably lie about on the floor and nobody
      picks them up”. He also asked us to send him
      “everything new that the Mensheviks

      publish”,[Letters Nos. 158, 162,
158.—Ed.] 

      trade union journals that had survived the debacle, etc.
    

      During his life in exile abroad Vladimir Ilyich felt the shortage, not
      only of books (although we tried to provide him with at least the most
      interesting books that appeared on the market), but also of Russian
      newspapers. Things were particularly bad in this respect during the
      imperialist war when at times Vladimir Ilyich had no Russian papers at
      all. “Please send Russian newspapers once a week after you have read
      them, because I have none at all,” he wrote in a letter dated
      September 20,

      1916.[Letter No. 259.—Ed.]


      Vladimir Ilyich was also in dire need of an income, especially during his
      last years abroad. “There will soon be an end to all our old sources
      of subsistence and the question of earning something is becoming acute,”
      wrote Nadezhda Krupskaya on December 14, 1915. She said that Vladimir
      Ilyich was “seriously troubled” because he was very
      conscientious where money was concerned or in accepting help from anybody,
      whoever it might be. “I shall get down to writing something or
      other, because prices have risen so hellishly that life has become
      devilishly difficult,” he wrote on September 20,

      1916.[13]


      Just a few months before the February Revolution, in the autumn of 1916,
      Vladimir Ilyich had to look for books to translate and to correspond with
      publishers about getting them published. How unproductive a use for his
      labour it would have been if he had been compelled to spend his time
      translating, but this, too, was eventually “hindered” by the
      revolution.
    

      Such were the conditions under which he lived abroad shortly before the
      revolution: lack of contact with Russia and the masses of working people,
      whom he was always trying so hard to exercise a direct influence over, the
      difficult

      

      living conditions in exile abroad—although energy and persistence
      were never lacking—so it is no wonder that his “nerves were
      on edge” and his whole organism seriously undermined.
    

      His reporting of Nadezhda Konstantinovna’s joke that he “must
      have been ’pensioned

      off‘”[Letter
      No. 262.—Ed.]

      touches a bitter note in the letter of February 15, 1917.
    

      After this letter in which the difficult conditions in which Vladimir
      Ilyich was forced to live in pre-revolutionary times could be seen behind
      the jokes, came the glad tidings by telegraph, “Arriving Monday 11
      p.m. inform 

      Pravda”.[Telegram
No. 264.—Ed.]


      That was the end of his period of exile, and also the end of his
      correspondence with his relatives.
    

      I received only two tiny notes from Vladimir Ilyich after 

      this,[Letters Nos. 265 and
266.—Ed.] 

      they were as short as his underground existence in Finland in the days of
      Kerensky and Kornilov on the eve of the Great October Revolution.

Notes
[1]
      What was in the letters, however, was usually intended for the whole family,
      or at least for those members who were living together at the time, “so
      as not to repeat myself”, as Lenin put it.
    
[2]
  The collection does not include the correspondence between Lenin and his
      relatives during his period of exile (for which see Proletarskaya
      Revolyutsiya Nos. 2-3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 for 1929), or that of 1896, when
      he was in the remand prison in St. Petersburg (December 9, 1895 to January
      29, 1897, 0.8.) and was frequently visited by his mother and sisters, so
      that his personal correspondence with them was insignificant (see the
      article by A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova “Vladimir Ilyich in
      Prison” in Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No. 3 for 1924 and
      the two letters of Lenin written in 4896 that are appended to the
      article). Between November 1905 and December 1907, Lenin lived in
      St. Petersburg or in Finland, saw his relatives frequently and wrote to
      them rarely. There are also many letters addressed to his sister Anna and
      his mother, especially at the time when I was living abroad. These letters
      will be published separately. (All the letters indicated by Maria Ulyanova
      as being omitted from the 1930 collection have been incorporated in the
      present volume.—Ed.)
    
[3]
  In the Central Archives, for instance, we found extracts from six of
      Lenin’s letters that had been placed in the files of the Moscow
      Gendarmerie as “material evidence”. These extracts are
      published as an appendix to this volume (see
      pp. 553-54).—Ed.
    
[4]
      It was, of course, impossible to keep them in Russia and only a few have
      been preserved in copies made abroad.
    
[5]
      Unfortunately only one letter from this correspondence has survived, the
      one dated December 16, :1909. See Lenin’s Works, Second
      (Russian) Edition, Vol. XIV, pp. 212-16. (Two letters from the
      correspondence of Lenin and Skvortsov-Stepanov have
      survived—December 2 and 16, 1909. See Collected Works,
      Vol. 34, pp. 407-10 and Vol. 16, pp. 117-22.)—Ed.
    
[6]
  The letter referred to is that of October 5, 1893 (Letter No. 1).
      —Ed.
    
[7]
      At that time Russkiye Vedomosti was the most decent and interesting
      of all bourgeois papers.
    
[8]
      The letter has been lost and the extract quoted here has been taken from
      the files of the Police Department (see Letter
      No. 247).—Ed.
    
[9]
      Part of this correspondence was included in the Collected Works,
  Vol. 36.—Ed.
    
[10]
      These statistics which Vladimir Ilyich used for his hook The
  Development of Capitalism in Russia, together with other books of
      his, were returned from abroad in 1929, and by the extracts he made and
      the marginal notes in the books it will be possible to draw a number of
      valuable conclusions on the way he worked.(Some of this material was
      published in Lenin Miscellany XXXIII in 1940.—Ed.)
    
[11]
  For the publication of this Letter we are once again indebted to the
      Moscow Gendarmerie, who kept it in their files.
    
[12]
      Letter No. 255. As regards replies from publishers at this lime, things
      were no better in other houses for Vladimir Ilyich. With reference to this
      see Letter No. 3 (dated November 27, 1901) from Lenin to L. I. Axelrod,
      published in Lenin Miscellany XI, p. 326 (Collected
      Works. Vol. 36, p. 100),—Ed.

      A man’s private correspondence is important in the compilation of his

      biography and in revealing him as an individual because it shows him in
      his day-to-day life, shows his relations with people and thus throws light
      on certain aspects of his character that are shown insufficiently or not
      at all by his scientific or public activities; in any case private
      correspondence adds new lines to the depiction of his character. Although
      Vladimir Ilyich’s letters are, as a rule, very brief, condensed, and
      devoid of any effusiveness, which he never liked, any more than he liked
      other forms of verbosity; although behind the letters one feels the man of
      action accustomed to grudge the time he devotes to anything personal, they
      nevertheless reflect in some degree the character of the writer.
    

      It should not be forgotten that the correspondence was carried on under
      conditions of tsarist censorship, when one had always to be prepared for
      the letters to be read by the police, with the result that they had to be
      particularly brief and condensed. “It is very difficult ... to carry
      on the correspondence one would 

      like,”[Letter No. 252.—Ed.]

      Vladimir Ilyich wrote to Maria. Letters in invisible ink allowed of
      greater freedom; in these, in addition to purely business matters, one
      came across accounts of the latest Party news, of congresses and
      conferences,and precise characterisations—in two or three
      words—of people, parties and trends given by Vladimir

      

      Ilyich, the sharp, decisive expressions he used in ordinary, free
      conversation. Such letters, however, had to be destroyed immediately they
      had been read, so, of course, not a single one of them has been
      preserved. They were written between the lines of other letters or, more
      frequently, between the lines of a book or journal or some reprint or
      other. And when Vladimir Ilyich acknowledged the receipt of books and
      wrote that some diary of the Congress of Technicians or reprint from the
      archives was “very interesting and thank Anyuta very much for 

      it”[Letter No. 42.—Ed.]

      that meant, of course, that the secret letter had been received. Nor did I
      keep letters that were written in ordinary ink but were not sent to my
      own address; among such were, for instance, the letters I received in
      1913-14 at the office of the journal Prosveshcheniye under an
      agreed-upon pseudonym. And it was not always convenient to keep letters
      sent to my private address—I recall a couple that Vladimir Ilyich
      himself asked me to destroy.
    

      As far as concerns the letters in this collection, it must be said that
      although they were written to people close to the writer and consequently
      contain much that has to do with the family alone and has little general
      interest, the addressees were people close to Vladimir Ilyich not only by
      blood but also in their convictions; he was also writing to them on
      business, so that the legal letters were often supplementary to the others
      and, therefore, formed a link in the whole chain of
      correspondence. Vladimir Ilyich, of course, did not write to mother on
      business matters, but at t~e same time he had nothing to hide from her,
      knowing that she was fully in sympathy with his revolutionary efforts and
      all his work. The result was that a letter addressed to one member of the
      family was, more often than not, intended for all. Requests to us, his
      sisters, brother and brother-in- law, were often contained in letters to
      our mother; as a rule they were read by all members of the family and were
      often forwarded to those living in other towns.
    

      The significance of Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives naturally
      becomes all the greater for their having been written in the quarter of a
      century in which our Party, the

      

      party that Vladimir Ilyich did so much to build, emerged and took shape.
    

      The most intensive and substantial correspondence belongs to the 1897-99
      and 1908-09 periods, in which two big books by Vladimir
      Ilyich—The Development of Capitalism in Russia and
      Materialism and Empirio-criticism—were published, because
      these letters contained business requests connected with the two
      publications, with the reading of the proofs, etc. Quite apart from this,
      the letters of the first of these two periods are fuller and more frequent
      since they were written when Vladimir Ilyich was in exile in Siberia, a
      condition that makes even the most restrained people turn to
      letter-writing because of the involuntary seclusion and the lack of
      contact with the life of the outside world. The letters written by
      Vladimir Ilyich in this period, especially the more detailed ones
      addressed to mother, give us an excellent picture of the conditions under
      which he lived, his inclinations and habits—in these letters he
      stands out, if one may put it so, in clearest relief as a person.
    

      Furthermore—and this is most important—in his letters from
      exile Vladimir Ilyich showed that he was not cut off from life, for in
      them he touched upon questions of Marxist theory and practice that were
      the most vital questions of the day. We see from the
      letters—although it occurs in a veiled form, the only possible
      form—his attitude to members of the Emancipation of Labour group,
      to Plekhanov and Axelrod, his complete agreement with them and his
      profound respect for them, his contact with them both through letters and
      through the talks I conducted with them on his instructions during my trip
      abroad in 1897. In these letters Vladimir Ilyich stated emphatically that
      “the isolation from political life” of which Axelrod had
      given warning must not on any account be permitted. “I believe the
      author to be wholly and a thousand times right, especially against narrow
      adherents of ‘economics’”,[Collected Works,
      Vol. 34. p. 26.—Ed.] meaning Masby and Co., the
      editors of the newspaper Samarsky Vestnik, who had accused the
      journal Novoye Slovo, headed by Struve, of liberalism and
      sympathy for the bourgeoisie. At that time Vladimir Ilyich considered it a
      matter of

      

      current importance not to confine propaganda and agitation to the economic
      struggle alone. “It is important that the illusion should not be
      allowed to develop that anything can be achieved by the struggle against
      the factory-owners alone,” he said to me shortly before his
      arrest. “From the very outset the political consciousness of the
      workers must be aroused.” It was for this reason that Vladimir Ilyich, in
      complete agreement with the Emancipation of Labour group, took the side of
      Struve in his differences with the Samarsky Vestnik writers, as
      Fedoseyev and Martov also did, and wrote to Maslov and Co. in Struve’s
      defence. One of the letters from Vladimir Ilyich (according to Maslov) was
      written in a militant tone and concluded with the words: “If you want
      war, let it be war”. In 1899, Vladimir Ilyich on several occasions
      spoke against the Samarans in his letters.
    

      “As far as the Samarans are concerned, I doubt very much whether
      they have said anything sensible (I have already had a letter about the
      accusation of ‘bourgeois sympathies’)”—letter of
      February 13,

      1899.[Letter No. 76.—Ed.]

      Concerning the review of Gvozdyov’s book he wrote: “I did not
      enjoy writing the review. I did not like the book—nothing new,
      generalities, an impossible style in places....” “It would be
      very useful and very interesting to talk on this subject (on the article
      about the heritage.—A.Y.) to people who do not limit themselves to
      Gvozdyov’s theories (have you read his book about

      kulaks?[1]
      
      I think it is very, very 

      weak).”[Letters Nos. 74 and
79.—Ed.] 
    

      Vladimir Ilyich continued his struggle against “economism” in
      agreement with Axelrod and Plekhanov, who in 1895, at the time of Vladimir
      Ilyich’s first trip abroad, insisted on the need to get away from
      the disputes between study circles and the Narodniks, to break down the
      isolation and go over to the organisation of a political party of
      Social-Democrats; he noted, however, another extreme in Axelrod’s
      new pamphlet (on the relationship between

      

      liberal and socialist democracy in Russia). Vladimir Ilyich showed that
      the author did not stress the class character of the movement
      sufficiently, that he was too kindly towards the Frondist agrarians and
      should have spoken of using them but not of supporting them.
    

      In these letters we find some expression of Vladimir Ilyich’s
      indignation at the revisionist trend then emerging—Bernstein’s
      book, articles by German revisionists in Neue Zeit and
      Bulgakov’s article. In respect of the last-named he wrote,
      “Bulgakov simply made me mad; such nonsense, such utter nonsense,
      and such eternal professorial pretentiousness—what the devil is
      this?!...” “Kautsky he distorts outright.... I am
      thinking of writing ‘about Kautsky’s book’”
      (against Bernstein.—A.Y.)—see letter of May 1,

      1899.[Letters Nos. 85 and
87.—Ed.] 
    

      About Bernstein he wrote the following: “Nadya and I started reading
      Bernstein’s book immediately; we have read more than a half and its
      contents astonish us more and more as we go on. It is unbelievably weak
      theoretically- mere repetition of someone else’s ideas. There are
      phrases about criticism but no attempt at serious independent
      criticism. In effect, it is opportunism ... and cowardly
      opportunism at that, since Bernstein does not want to attack the programme
      directly .... Bernstein’s statement that many Russians agree with
      him ... made us very indignant. We people here must indeed be getting
      ‘old’ and must be ‘lagging behind the new words’
      ... copied from Bernstein. I shall soon be writing to Anynta on this
      subject in

      detail.”[2]


      Ilyich asked his sister Maria to get him reports of the Han over Party
      Congress (letter of August 22, 1899) that was to be held in October. The
      chief issue at the Hanover Congress, of course, was that of
      Bernstein. When Vladimir Ilyich sent his review of Bulgakov’s 

      article[2]

      to Novoye Slovo (it was published in Nauchnoye
      Obozreniye) he wrote, “Of course, polemics among one’s own
      people are unpleasant

      

      and I tried to tone the article down, but to keep quiet about differences
      is not only unpleasant, it is downright harmful—and,
      furthermore, one cannot keep quiet about the chief differences between
      ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘criticism’ that have come to the
      fore in German and Russian

      Marxism”.[Letter No. 87.—Ed.]
    

      Tugan-Baranovsky also made Vladimir Ilyich indignant (letter of June 20,
      1899). “I have seen Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 5, and find that

      Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in it is monstrously foolish and
      nonsensical; he has simply arbitrarily introduced changes into the rate of
      surplus value in order to ‘refute’ Marx; he assumes an
      absurdity—a change in the productivity of labour without a change in
      the value of the product. I do not know whether every such nonsensical
      article is worth writing about. Let him first fulfil his promise to
      develop it in detail. In general, I am becoming a more and more determined
      opponent of the latest ‘critical stream’ in Marxism and of
      neo-Kantianism (which has produced, incidentally, the idea of separating
      sociological from economic laws). The author of Beiträge zur
      Geschichte des

Materialismus[3]

      is quite right in declaring that neo-Kantianism is a reactionary theory of
      the reactionary bourgeoisie and in rebelling against

      Bernstein.”[Letter No. 90.—Ed.]
    

      Vladimir Ilyich’s second article—“Once More on the Theory of 

      Realisation”[Collected Works, Vol. 4,
pp. 74-93.—Ed.]--was

      directed mainly against Struve, whose sympathy for revisionism was
      becoming more and more obvious. It is true that at this time Vladimir
      Ilyich’s criticism was still of a friendly nature since he was
      criticising one of his own side.
    

      “I am now finishing an article in reply to Struve. It seems to me he
      has got things badly mixed up and his article may cause a good deal of
      misunderstanding among supporters and malicious glee among
      opponents” (March

      7).[Letter No. 80.—Ed.] 
    

      There gradually arose, however, misgivings of a more serious nature that
      come out more markedly in the letters to Potresov written in the same year
      (Lenin Miscellany IV).

      

      He also wrote that he had begun studying philosophy from the few
      philosophical books in his possession.
    

      “Volodya is busy reading all kinds of philosophy (that is now his
      official occupation)—Holbach, Helvétius, etc.,” Nadezhda
      Krupskaya wrote in a letter to our mother on June 20, 

      1899.[Krupskaya’s Letter
No. 16.—Ed.] 
    

      And lastly there was the document known as the Credo, probably
      the biggest political fact of the period, and the 

      reply[Collected Works, Vol. 4,
pp. 167-82.—Ed.] 

      to it compiled by 17 Social-Democrats; this is also mentioned in the
      letters.
    

      “I shall write to Anyuta soon about the Credo (which
      interests and exasperates me and everybody else) in 

      detail.”[4] 

      (August 1, 1899.)[Letter
No. 92.—Ed.] 
    

      “As far as the Credo der Jungen is concerned, I was amazed
      at the emptiness of the phrases. It is not a Credo but a pitiful
      collection of words! I intend to write in greater detail about it.”
      (August 25,

      1899.)[Letter No. 97.—Ed.] 
    

      I had sent this document to Vladimir Ilyich and quite by chance given it
      this name. I had not regarded it as being of any particular significance
      and in a letter in invisible ink I had said as briefly as possible
      “I am sending you a Credo of the young.”
    

      Later, when the name had come to be accepted and there was talk about an
      “Anti-Credo”, I was worried about having exaggerated the
      importance of the document with this incorrect name, and wrote to Vladimir
      Ilyich about it in invisible ink. It seems this place in the letter
      remained unread because when he returned from exile I told him the
      document had not been the “symbol of faith” of any group of
      the young but came from the pen of two authors, Kuskova and Prokopovich,
      and that I had given it the name of Credo myself; Vladimir Ilyich
      was surprised and asked: “You did?” But then, after a short
      silence, he said in any case it had been necessary to reply to it. And
      that is how the document went the rounds under that name.
    

      Thus we see that in his letters to his relatives sent from

      

      his place of exile, Vladimir Ilyich reacted to all the most urgent
      questions of the Party life of that time; there are signs in these letters
      of the main course he was mapping out, the course that was to avoid the
      narrowness of economism and also the threatening danger of diffusion that
      lay in offering favours to the liberals, and also the purely
      intellectualist attraction to revisionism and criticism for
      criticism’s sake. While still in exile he was already selecting his
      comrades for the future Party organisation and for “undisguised

      literature”;[5] 

      he wrote to Potresov about the need for this and naming for it, of all his
      comrades in exile, only Martov, “the only one who really took all
      this (the interests of a journal, of the Party) seriously to
      heart”. He drew up a plan for Iskra.
    

      In Vladimir Ilyich’s letters for the 1908-09 period— the time
      when his Materialism and Empirio-criticism was being
      published—there are also statements on general matters, especially
      on the subject of his book, although such statements are fewer than in the
      letters sent from Siberia which were, in general, much more detailed. The
      attempts to revise the philosophical aspect of Marxism (they were headed
      by Bogdanov and Lunacharsky in Russia) made Vladimir Ilyich no less
      indignant than Bernstein’s politico-economic revision. We saw that
      when he was still in Siberia this neo-Kantian trend in Marxism aroused in
      him the desire to undertake the study of philosophy. In the years of
      reaction following our first revolution the “god seeker” trend
      made him take up philosophical studies seriously and write a book
      analysing this deviation from Marxism.
    

      “My illness has held up my work on philosophy very badly,” he
      wrote to his sister Maria on July 13, 1908. “I

      

      am now almost well again and will most certainly write the book. I have
      been doing a lot of work on the Machists and I think I have sorted out all
      their inexpressible vulgarities (and those of
      ‘empirio-monism’ as

      well).”[Letter
No. 166.—Ed.] 
    

      Vladimir Ilyich was terribly indignant at 

      “popovshchina”[3],  

      a word he used for all kinds of god-seeking and all other attempts at
      dragging religious views into Marxism in some form or another. Because of
      the censorship he pro posed changing the word “popovshchina”
      into “fideism”, with a footnote explaining it
      (fideism is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or
      which generally attaches significance to

      faith).[Collected Works, Vol. 14,
p. 19.—Ed.] 
    

      That is how it appeared in the book. In the manuscript, the phrase to
      which this footnote was added read as follows: “Supported by all
      these supposedly recent doctrines, our destroyers of dialectical
      materialism proceed fearlessly to downright popovshchina
      (clearest of all in the case of Lunacharsky, but by no means in his case
      alone!)”. And Vladimir Ilyich came down very heavily on these
      “destroyers”; he asked me not to tone down anything concerning
      them and I had difficulty in getting him to agree to a certain toning down
      for the sake of the censorship.
    

      “‘Mentally projected god’ will have to be changed to
      ‘mentally projected for himself—well, to use a mild
      expression—religious conceptions’ or something of the

      sort”.[Letter No. 175.—Ed.]
    

      In the manuscript this phrase had the following wording: “People can
      think and mentally project for themselves any kind of hell, all sorts of
      devils. Lunacharsky even mentally projected for himself a god.” When
      there was no question of censorship he wrote to me: “Please
      do not tone down anything in the places against Bogdanov,
      Lunacharshy and Co. They must not be toned down. You have deleted
      the passage about Chernov being a ‘more honest’ opponent than
      they, which is a great pity. The shade of meaning you have given is not
      the one I want. There is now no overall consistency in my accusations. The
      crux of the issue is that our Machists are dishonest,
      mean-spirited, cowardly enemies

      

      of Marxism in philosophy.” Further he said: “Please do not
      tone down the places against Bogdanov and Lunacharsky’s
      popovshchina. We have completely broken off relations
      with them. There is no reason for toning them down, it is not worth the
      trouble.” (March 9, 1909.)
    

      “Especially—do not throw out Purishkevich,” he
      wrote on March 21, “and the others in the section on the criticism
      of

      Kantianism!”[See Letters Nos. 183, 182,
184.—Ed.] 
    

      Vladimir Ilyich compared the Machists to Purishkevich because the latter
      had once said that he criticised the Cadets more consistently and with
      greater determination than the Marxists did, and the Machists assured us
      that they criticised Kant more consistently and with greater determination
      than the Marxists did. But, Mr. Purishkevich, Vladimir Ilyich said to him,
      “it must not be forgotten that you criticised the
      Constitutional-Democrats for being excessively democratic while
      we criticised them for being insufficiently democratic. The
      Machists criticise Kant for being too much of a materialist, we criticise
      him for not being enough of a materialist. The Machists criticise Kant
      from the right, we from the left.” (Works, Vol. XIII, p.

      163.)[Collected Works, Vol. 14,
p. 199.—Ed.]
    

      When he later sent a supplement to Chapter Four, Section One, “From
      What Angle Did N. G. Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?” Vladimir
      Ilyich wrote: “I regard it as extremely important to counterpose
      Chernyshevsky to the

      Machists.”[Letter
No. 185.—Ed.] 

      Vladimir Ilyich mentioned the political aspect of the differences known in
      those days as the differences with the Vperyod group in only a
      couple of words in his legal letters. “Things are bad
      here—Spaltung (split.--A.Y.), or rather, there
      will be one; I hope that in a month or six weeks I shall be able to give
      you exact information. So far I can do no more than guess”

      (May 26).[Letter No. 191.—Ed.] 

      Details of this split were given in the “Report on the
      Extended Editorial Board of Proletary” and in the appended
      resolutions:

      5. The Break-away of Comrade Maximov (Bogdanov) and

      4. The Party School Being Set Up Abroad at X—(Capri),

      

      for which the extended editorial board declared it could bear no
      responsibility “in view of the fact that the initiators and
      organisers of the school are one and all representatives of
      otzovism, ultimatumism and god-building” (June 1909, Works,
      Vol. XIV, pp. 

      89-103).[Collected Works, Vol. 15,
pp. 425-51.—Ed.] 
    

      Social affairs are touched upon still more scantily in the letters of the
      following years, which were, in general, fewer.
    

      The first years of the second exile abroad were particularly dull and
      miserable and were a sad experience for Vladimir Ilyich. I saw that for
      myself when I visited him in Paris in the autumn of 1911. He seemed to be
      less vivacious than usual. One day when we were out walking together he
      said to me: “I wonder if I shall manage to live to the next
      revolution.” The sad expression on his face reminded me of the
      photograph of him taken in 1895 by the secret police. The time was one of
      profound reaction. Only a few signs of a renascence were to be
      seen—the publication of Zvezda and Mysl, for
      example.
    

      A note of pleasure resounded in his letter of January 3,

      1911. “Yesterday I received Zvezda No. I from Russia and
      today Mysl No. 1. That is something to cheer me up!... It really
      is a
      
      pleasure!”[Letter
No. 215.—Ed.]
    

      His depression was deepened, of course, by the “bitter
      squabbles”, which had a bad effect on work; Vladimir Ilyich wrote
      about this in 1910, having in mind the differences that existed between
      the C.C. Bureau Abroad and the Vperyod group. He referred to
      “a period so full of squabbles” in his letter of January
      3,1911, and apologised to my husband for his unpunctuality in answering
      letters.
    

      It can be seen from his letters that Vladimir Ilyich’s mood greatly
      improved after he moved to Krakow in the autumn of 1912. He wrote that he
      felt better than in Paris, he was resting his nerves, there was more
      literary work and fewer squabbles. The work for Pravda, the
      improved situation in working-class circles and in revolutionary work
      naturally had a beneficial effect on Vladimir Ilyich. There was a
      noticeable lessening of the squabbles, so much so that Gorky, Vladimir
      Ilyich wrote, was less unfriendly

      

      towards us. It will be remembered that it was shortly after this that Gorky
      became one of the editors of the Bolshevik journal
      Prosveshcheniye.
    

      Vladimir Ilyich wrote of the proposal for Pravda to publish
      pamphlets; he said that he was seeing more people from Russia and seemed
      to feel closer to Russia; he invited my husband, Mark Yelizarov, to the
      health resort at Zakopane, saying that trains went there direct from War
      saw; he also invited me, hinting that people living in the frontier zone
      could make the journey for thirty kopeks.
    

      In general he was pleased with Krakow and wrote that he was not thinking of
      moving anywhere “unless the war chases us away, but I do not greatly
      believe in the 

      war”.[Letter No. 229.—Ed.]
    

      I moved to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1913 where I was employed by
      the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye, the journal
      Rabotnitsa and also Pravda. In addition to the letters
      in invisible ink, I had at that time a considerable correspondence with
      Vladimir Ilyich on literary matters; they were addressed to the office of
      Prosveshcheniye in the name of Andrei Nikolayevich. Out of this
      official correspondence I have so far been able to recover only two
      letters that had been copied by the police and which are not included in
      this collection of letters to relatives.
    

      During the war, of course, letters were fewer and many of them were
      lost. The few that were preserved, even the postcards, touch upon
      questions that were most painful for Vladimir Ilyich. A postcard dated
      February 1, 1910 said, “We have been having ‘stormy’
      times lately, but they have ended with an attempt at peace with the
      Mensheviks—yes, yes, strange as it may seem; we have closed down the
      factional newspaper and are trying harder to promote unity. We
      shall see whether it can be

      done....”[Letter
No. 204.—Ed.] 
    

      The postcard of March 24, 1912 says, “. . .there is more bickering
      and abuse of each other than there has been for a long time—there
      has probably never been so much before. All the groups and sub-groups have
      joined forces against the last conference and those who organised it, so
      that matters even went as far as fisticuffs at meetings

      here.”[Letter No. 222.—Ed.]  
    



      In his letter of November 14, 1914 he wrote, “It is very sad to
      watch the growth of chauvinism in a number of countries and to see such
      treacherous acts as those of the 

      German[6]

      (and not only the German) Marxists or pseudo-Marxists.... It stands to
      reason that the liberals are praising Plekhanov again; he has fully
      deserved that shameful punishment.... I have seen the disgraceful,
      shameless issue of Sovremenny Mir.... Shame!

      Shame!”[7]


      Official correspondence in invisible ink became more intensive in those
      years, when all correspondence with the Central Committee was greatly
      reduced, and in the only postcard from Vladimir Ilyich that has been
      preserved for the year 1915 he thanked me “very, very, very much for
      the book, for the most interesting collection of pedagogical publications
      and for the letter”. The collection of pedagogical publications was
      “interesting”, of course, on account of what was written
      between the lines in invisible ink.
    

      In Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives, therefore, we see his
      comments on the struggle for the correct under standing of Marxism and for
      its correct application at the various stages of development of the
      proletarian movement which he conducted throughout his life.
    
___

      Now let me try to draw some conclusions on the basis of these letters, to
      show in brief those aspects of Vladimir Ilyich’s personality, the
      features of his character, that, in my opinion, stand out in his letters
      to his relatives.
    

      The first thing we notice (and this has been mentioned in the reviews of
      the letters published in part in Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya) is
      the permanence of his attachment, his enduring, unchanging attitude
      towards the same people in the course of many long years. It is true that
      these are his immediate relatives, but the permanence of his affection,
      the steadiness and stability of his character are

      

      clearly delineated in these letters. We can also see from the same letters
      the permanence of his conviction and his faith in his cause; in Vladimir
      Ilyich’s letters to people who were close to him, such people as one
      could be most out spoken with, there is not the slightest vacillation or
      doubt, not the slightest tendency to veer in any other direction.
    

      Nor do we see any traces of whining and despondency in him—such
      behaviour is, in general, not in keeping with his character—or any
      complaints about his position, be it in prison, in exile in Siberia or
      abroad, or even any sour note in his descriptions. Of course, this was
      also because most of the letters were addressed to mother, who had
      suffered so much on account of her children, a fact of which Vladimir
      Ilyich, who deeply loved and respected his mother, was profoundly
      aware. He felt that his own personal activities were causing his mother a
      great deal of worry and pain and as far as lay in his power he tried to
      make things easier for her.
    

      His energy could be felt in letters to other members of the family as
      well, even to those who were at various times living apart from mother. I
      remember, for instance, the letters he wrote me between 1900 and 1902,
      when I was living abroad, and which I naturally had to destroy before I
      returned to Russia. I remember that his letters were always refreshing and
      an antidote to all depression and nervousness; they inspired enthusiasm
      and made one pull oneself together morally. His self-confidence did not,
      how ever, crush one; it gave one energy and an urge to greater
      self-fulfilment; his witty jokes filled one with the joy of living and
      this was the best lubrication for any kind of work. His letters display a
      great sensitiveness to the mood of the other person and friendly,
      comradely attention to him—this can be seen in his solicitude for
      his mother and other members of the family and his solicitude for his
      comrades—his questions and tales about them when he was in prison,
      in exile or abroad (see, for example, the letters of March 15 and April 5,
      1897).
    

      At the same time one notices the simplicity and the natural manner of
      Vladimir Ilyich, his great modesty, the complete absence not only of
      conceit and boastfulness but of any attempt to play up the services he had
      rendered or to

      

      show off; and this was in his youth, when some sort of showing off is
      natural in a talented person. For a long time he would not agree to call
      his big, fundamental monograph The Development of Capitalism in
Russia, which, he said, “is too bold, too broad and promises
      too much ... and should be more modest” (February 13, 1899) and the
      argument that the book would sell better with that title he “did not
      like” either (January 10,

      1899).[See Letters Nos. 76 and
69.—Ed.] 
    

      All the labour that he devoted to the study of material for his book on
      philosophy and other works while in prison, in exile and later when he was
      abroad, the writing of legal and illegal pamphlets and articles, many of
      which were lost—all this labour he regarded as something perfectly
      natural and normal. Here his tremendous industry, his natural restraint
      and his tenacity in carrying through what ever he had undertaken are also
      apparent. The time limits fixed for The Development of Capitalism in
      Russia or for certain chapters of the book were, as a rule, kept to,
      as can be seen from the letters printed below.
    

      Since he was exacting to himself he was naturally exacting to others. He
      always gave many instructions and insisted on their being carried out; he
      trained everybody who at any time worked with him in the accuracy and
      thoroughness that was his own. Vladimir Ilyich was always displeased with
      unpunctuality, with delays in work, in carrying out instructions or in
      answering letters. In his letters sent from exile he inveighs against
      Struve for his slackness in answering; in the letters of 1908-09 he
      expresses his displeasure with Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov for his careless
      reading of the proofs of Materialism and Empirio-criticism, which
      he had undertaken to correct, and so on.
    

      From Vladimir Ilyich’s letters we can also see his great modesty and his
      complete lack of fastidiousness in life, his ability to be content with
      little; no matter what conditions fate provided for him he always wrote
      that he needed nothing and was eating well—whether it was in Siberia
      where he had to provide everything for himself out of an allowance of
      eight rubles a month, or when he was living abroad and we were able to
      check up on him during

      

      our rare visits and were always able to prove that he had far from enough
      to eat. He was always worried by the fact that his circumstances forced
      him to accept financial aid from mother longer than is usual, instead of
      helping her. On October 5, 1893, he wrote, “... The expenditure is
      still excessive—38 rubles in a month. Obviously I have not been
      living carefully; in one month I have spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the
      horse trains, for instance. When I get used to the place I shall probably
      spend 

      less.”[Letter No. 1.—Ed.] 

      Later, too, he was worried and asked mother not to send him money and not
      to save money from her pension when he heard that this was what she wanted
      to do on learning of his straitened circumstances from a letter sent to
      someone else (letter of January 19, 1911).
    

      He was also embarrassed at having to take money from the Party, when his
      income from writing was not enough to live on. With some bitterness
      Vladimir Ilyich related Nadezhda Krupskaya’s joke that he

      “must have been ‘pensioned off’”, when money came
      to him from Russia (February 15,

      1917).[Letter No. 262.—Ed.] 
    

      For reasons of economy Vladimir Ilyich tried wherever possible to use
      books from libraries. He spent next to nothing on amusements; visits to
      theatres and concerts were so rare that they could not affect his budget
      (see letter of February 9, 1901). Vladimir Ilyich, indeed, preferred the
      open air to social forms of recreation, where there were a lot of
      people. “Here,” he wrote from Stjernsund (Finland) on his
      return from the Fifth Party Congress, “you can have a wonderful
      rest, swimming, walking, no people and no work. No people and no
      work—that is the best thing for me (June 27, 1907). The walk is a
      pleasure although I have to walk about 5 versts a day, an hour’s
      walk, he wrote from Siberia in

      1897.[Letters Nos. 155 and
19.—Ed.]
    

      With their rucksacks on their backs, he and his wife would wander over the
      mountain slopes and passes of Switzerland. He climbed in the Alps and
      when he lived near Krakow he went climbing in the Tatras. It was not only
      such

      

      outstanding beauties of nature that attracted him; he rode or walked round
      the environs of big cities such as London or Munich. “We are the
      only people among the comrades here who are exploring every bit
      of the surrounding country. We discover various ‘rural’ paths,
      we know all the places nearby and intend to go further

      afield.”[Letter
No. 448.—Ed.] 

      “We find the road to out-of-the-way places to which none of the
      exiles ever go.” He was interested in sport—shooting, skating,
      cycling and chess, and engaged in these amusements with all the
      ingenuousness of a youth or even a boy.
    

      He describes some of his mountain trips very vividly, if briefly—the
      trip to Saliéve near Geneva, for instance, or his Shu-shu-shu in
      Siberia.
    

      In the letters there is also evidence of Vladimir Ilyich’s ability
      to make the most of the present moment; in prison, in exile and in the
      worst times abroad he delved into scientific and theoretical problems,
      erected and strengthened, so to speak, the scientific buttresses of the
      cause to which he devoted his life—work for the proletarian
      revolution—at times when fate decreed that he must remain more or
      less aloof from direct participation. And when life brought him into
      greater contact with people—in the country, travelling, in
      trains—he showed his ability to take in reality, to understand the
      masses, to rise to generalisations from minor facts and to determine and
      consolidate the line that leads from theory and the general ideals of life
      to life as it really is and back again. He showed his ability to gather
      impressions from everywhere, from all conversations, from letters. We see
      how Vladimir Ilyich hungered after ordinary letters that simply drew a
      picture of the life around one with out setting out to achieve any general
      aims, how hungry he was for them and asked for them to be sent more often.
    

      And, lastly, we see in these letters Vladimir Ilyich’s ability to
      maintain his composure and equilibrium both in prison and after (see the
      letter with his advice to our sister Maria, May 19, 1901), how, after
      imprisonment or various social and political disturbances that had
      undermined this equilibrium, he would make determined efforts to return to
      normal. He realised that this equilibrium was

      

      essential for the mental or political work that was the aim of his
      life. For the same reason he spent the whole three years of his exile in
      Shushenskoye, never asking for a transfer to a town in the way most
      exiles did. He wrote that temporary visits to the town were better than
      permanent residence there. Speaking of the suicide of Fedoseyev he wrote,
      “For people in exile, these ‘exile scandals’ are the worst
      thing of all.” “No, don’t wish me comrades from among
      the intellectuals in Shushenskoye—I’d rather not!”
      (January 24,

      1898).[Letters Nos. 53 and
38.—Ed.] 
    

      In bringing to a close this brief indication of the traits and
      peculiarities in the character of Vladimir Ilyich which, in my opinion,
      are shown by the letters to his relatives published below, I hope that
      they will help the reader to gain a clearer picture and a closer
      understanding of Vladimir Ilyich as a person.

      L. Kamenev’s interpretation of these words in the Preface to

      of course to be under stood, not to mean liberal literature wearing the
      cloak of Social-Democracy, but our own Social-Democratic literature that
      is compelled by the censor to take on legal form, i.e., there must be
      illegal as well as legal Social-Democratic literature. This passage gives

October 5


Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter of
October 2. At long last I have found myself a good room, or
so it seems; there are no other lodgers and the landlady
has a small family; the door between my room and their
drawing-room is papered over, so that sounds are faint.
The room is clean and light. There is a good entrance. Since,
in addition, it is not far from the centre (only some 15
minutes’ walk from the library) I am, quite satisfied.

I saw Tillo yesterday and today. He did not get the
ticket and, unfortunately, cannot get it because the person
he was counting on is not here. Incidentally, he says that
when his own position in the provisional railway
administration is more secure, perhaps he will be able to. That,
it seems, will not be soon.

I went to Volkov Cemetery soon after my arrival—
everything, the cross and wreath, is
intact.[3]

Your loving,


V. Ulyanov

Please send me some money, mine is nearly at an
end.[1]

I have been informed from Samara that the fee for the Grafov
case (the Kazan case that I conducted in Samara) has been
promised for November. That will give me 70 rubles (if
the promise is fulfilled, and what chance there is of that,
I don’t know). I have been promised a job in a consulting
lawyer’s office here, but when that will be arranged (and
whether it will be arranged) I do not know.
 

Write and tell me about the state of your finances; did
you get anything from Auntie? Did you get the September
rent from Krushvits? Is there much left of the deposit
(500 rubles) after moving and settling
down?[4]

I am now, for the first time in St. Petersburg, keeping
a cash-book to see how much I actually spend. It turned
out that for the month August 28 to September 27 I spent
altogether 54 rubles 30 kopeks, not including payment for
things (about 10 rubles) and expenses for a court case (also
about 10 rubles) which I shall probably conduct. It is true
that part of this 54 rubles was spent on things that do not
have to be bought every month (galoshes, clothes, books,
an abacus, etc.), but even discounting that (16 rubles),
the expenditure is still excessive—38 rubles in a month.
Obviously I have not been living carefully; in one month
I have spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the horse trams, for
instance. When I get used to the place I shall probably
spend less.

 
Notes
 

[1]

  I shall have to pay 10 rubles when I am appointed assistant,
which should be soon.—Lenin
 



[2]
 Ulyanova, Maria Alexandrovna (1835–1916)—mother of Vladimir
Ilyich Lenin, daughter of A.D. Blank, a doctor, who held advanced
views. A well-educated woman, she spoke several languages
and was an accomplished musician. Study at home enabled her
to qualify as a schoolteacher in 1863. She possessed rare talents
as an educationalist and devoted herself entirely to her family
and children. Having a strong character and great will power,
she shared her children’s ideas and brought them up to be honest,
industrious and sympathetic towards the needs of the people.
She was a warm supporter of her children in their revolutionary
struggle and endured the misfortunes that came upon her family
with courage and fortitude. Her children’s attitude to her was
one of love and affection and Lenin always displayed exceptional
consideration for her. She is buried in Volkov Cemetery in
Leningrad.





[3]

 One of Lenin’s younger sisters, Olga Ilyinichna Ulyanova (1871-
1891) is buried in Volkov Cemetery, Leningrad. She was a
talented and industrious girl with a strong character. In 1887 she
graduated from secondary school with a gold medal and entered the Higher
Courses for Women (Bestuzhev’s) in St. Petersburg. She died
of enteric at the age of 19.





[4]

 The money referred to is what Lenin’s mother should have
received from Kokushkino and Alakayevka.

 Kokushkino—a village 40 versts from Kazan in which
A. D. Blank, Lenin’s maternal grandfather, owned some land,
a house and a separate cottage. When he died, this property was
inherited by his daughters, and Lenin’s mother’s share was
under the control of her sister, L. A. Ponomaryova.

 Lenin was exiled to the village of Kokushkino for his
participation in the student disturbances in December 1887. The
cottage, in which Lenin lived during his exile, has been restored and
is now a Lenin Museum.

 Alakayevka—a village some 50 versts from Samara (now
Kuibyshev) near which Lenin’s mother acquired a farmhouse; the
Ulyanov family lived there every summer from 1889 to 1893. When
the family moved to Moscow from Samara the farmhouse was
rented to Krushvits, mentioned by Lenin in this letter.

Manyasha,[1]


I  read with interest your letter of September 27 and
would be very glad if you would write to me occasionally.

I have not been to the Hermitage Museum or to theatres.
I somehow do not want to go alone. In Moscow I shall be
glad to go to the Tretyakov Gallery and other places with you.

I read Russkiye
Vedomosti[5][2]

(two weeks old) in the
Public Library. When I get a job here perhaps I Will
subscribe to it. It is not worth while saving them for me, but
I think they should not be torn up too soon—there may
be something interesting that will be needed.

From what you say about the French teacher I see that
if the Moscow schoolgirls are ahead of you it is not by very
much. The average girl probably doesn’t know the
language any better than you? Write and tell me whether you
spend a lot of time doing your homework.

Tell
Mitya[6][3]

that he should tell the bookseller to go to
hell if he asks 25 rubles for Klyuchevsky—he should not pay
more than 4
rubles.[7] How is Mitya getting on with his studies?

Till we meet,


Yours,
V. U.

Can you read my writing?

Communist Party and public affairs; Lenin’s youngest sister.
She joined the revolutionary movement while still a student,
became a professional revolutionary in 1898 and was later among
the Bolsheviks; she did Party work in St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Saratov and in other towns in Russia and abroad. In 1900 she
began taking an active part in the work of the newspaper Iskra
(The Spark) and from the autumn of 1903 was in the secretariat
of the C.C. of the Party. In 1904 she worked in the St. Petersburg
Bolshevik organisation. She was arrested and exiled several times
for her revolutionary activities. From March 1917 to the spring
of 1929 she was a member of the Pravda editorial board and the
executive secretary of the paper. She became a member of the
Central Control Commission at the 14th Party  Congress   and a
member of the Soviet Control Commission at the 17th Party
Congress. She was a member of the Moscow Soviet and in 1935
was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R.

 Russkiye  Vedomosti (Russian   Recorder)—a  Moscow newspaper
that began publication in 1863; moderate liberal in its views.
It was suppressed in 1918 at the same time as other
counter-revolutionary periodicals.





[6]

 The Mitya here referred to is =

Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov (1874–1943)—
professional  revolutionary,   Bolshevik, physician  by training;
Lenin’s younger brother. He began his revolutionary activities
in 1894 in Marxist student groups in Moscow; in 1900 he entered
the Iskra organisation. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
he was delegate from the Tula Committee, an Iskra supporter and
member of the majority. After the Congress he was appointed
agent of the Central Committee. He was arrested and imprisoned
several times for his revolutionary activities. From 1905 to 1907
he was a member of the Simbirsk Bolshevik Committee; he then
worked as doctor in Serpukhov and Feodosia, all the time
maintaining contact with the central Bolshevik organisations.  He was
mobilised in  1914 and   conducted   revolutionary work among
the soldiers.  After the   October Socialist  Revolution he was
engaged in Party and government work in the Crimea; in 1921 he
took   up   work   at  the   People’s   Commissariat   of   Health   in
Moscow; from 1925 to 1930 worked at the Sverdlov Communist
University and from 1933 onwards in the medical department of
the Kremlin; he was active in  promoting the Lenin  Central
Museum.





[7]

 This apparently refers to lithographed copies of lectures on
Russian history by Vasily Klyuchevsky, the publication of which
began in the 1880–81 academic year. In the Central Party Archives
at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism there is  a lithographed
copy of  Klyuchevsky’s Course of  Modern  Russian  History for

   

the 1883–84 academic year which bears notes in Lenin’s hand.

December 13, 1894

I have not had a letter from home for a long time. How
are you, Manyasha? They did write that you are going to
school again.

You ought to force yourself to take a walk for about two
hours every day. It is not worth while poring over your
lessons so industriously—you will ruin your health.

What do you do apart from school work? What are you
reading? Do you see
M.I.?[1]

Is she going to the Crimea or
not? And write to me, if it is convenient, about what
happened to Klyuchevsky at the University. They say he
delivered a lecture of some sort and then published a book.
I have not seen even the title of the book—it would be
interesting to know about
it.[4]

How is your new acquaintanceship proceeding?

Yours,

V. U.

I wrote a long time ago asking someone to find out about
Volume III of Capital. It has been promised me (an
acquaintance,[2]

whom
Mark[5] knows). Now I do not know anything.
Will he fulfil his promise? Does he still promise or does
he now refuse? I should like to know because it is not easy
to get that book. Tell Mark this, please.

Regards to everybody.
 

Is Mother well? Kiss her for me.

I shall be expecting a letter from you.

Tell
Anyuta[6][3]

I have been to Al. Andreyevich and it
was a waste of time. He has received a promise and is
waiting, but whether he will wait in vain or not, nobody knows.

 
Notes
 

[1]
Did she get my letter?—Lenin

Zimmermann (Gvozdyov), whom Mark Yelizarov knew in Samara, or it
may have been V. A. Yonov.—Ed.

[4]
Lenin refers in this letter to a speech made by Klyuchevsky “In
Memory of the Late Emperor  Alexander  III,  May  He Rest
in Peace” which was published as a pamphlet. Students of
Moscow University bought up several hundred copies and added to
them mimeographed  pages containing D.  I.   Fonvizin’s fable
“The Intriguing Fox”;   these were distributed   as   a  “revised
and supplemented edition”. A copy of this edition was presented
to Klyuchevsky at a lecture and he was shouted and whistled
down. Over fifty students were arrested and some of them were
sent out of Moscow.





[5]
The Mark referred to in this letter is =

Mark Timofeyevich
Yelizarov(1863–1919),   =

professional revolutionary,  Bolshevik,  Soviet
statesman,  husband of Anna  Ilyinichna  Ulyanova-Yelizarova,
Lenin’s elder sister. He joined the Social-Democratic movement
in 1893, did Party work in St. Petersburg, Moscow and the
Volgaside towns, took an active part in the First Russian
Revolution and was one of the leaders of the railwayman’s general strike
in 1905. He was many times arrested and exiled. After the October
Revolution he became People’s Commissar of Railways and then
a member of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Trade
and Industry.





[6]
The Anyuta here referred to is Anna Ilyinichna
Ulyanova-Yelizarova (1864–1935)—professional revolutionary, leading figure in
the Communist Party, Lenin’s elder sister. She joined the
revolutionary movement in 1886 and the Social-Democratic movement
in 1893. In 1898 she became a member of the first Moscow
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. From 1900 to 1905 she worked in the
Iskra organisation and on Bolshevik illegally issued newspapers
and was a member of the editorial board of the newspaper Vperyod.
Between 1904 and 1906 she maintained contact with the Central
Committee of the Bolshevik Party which was abroad, and acted
as treasurer to the St. Petersburg Committee. From 1908 to 1910
she was engaged in revolutionary activities in Moscow and
Saratov and from 1912 to 1914 collaborated in the Bolshevik
periodicals Pravda, Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment) and Rabotnitsa
(The Working Woman). She was arrested and exiled a number of
times. In 1917 she was secretary to the editorial board of Pravda
and editor of the magazine Tkach(The Weaver). From 1918 to
1921 she worked in the People’s Commissariat of Education.
She was active in the work of founding the Lenin Institute and
herself did research work there. She was the author of a number
of reminiscences of Lenin.

December 24 
 

Manyasha, 

At last I have found time to answer your letter of the 
 15th.

I  cannot agree with your views of the school and your
studies.

First—the doctor said don’t go till Christmas and you
think it will not be convenient to miss your lessons. People
miss months, not only weeks; it will not be any better if
you have to take to your bed by the spring.

Secondly—you write that either you will stop studying
altogether or, if you go on, you can’t be “just off-hand
about it”. It seems to me that the main thing now is to
graduate. For that there is no sense in working extra hard;
what does it matter if you get
threes[1]

and an occasional 

two[2]

by way of exception? In any case you will get your
remove since you had good marks in the first and second
terms. And that is all you need. Moreover, since you did
everything thoroughly at the beginning, you will finish
up well even if you do no homework. You must agree that
those who go all the way through with threes do not, first,
do their homework and, second, do not know the first thing
about the subject. [At least that is how it was at my school.]
So you will have an advantage over them.

It seems to me that your only chance of finishing the
course is to be “off-hand” about it. If you don’t, you will
be seriously ill by summer.
 

 If  you cannot take things easy, then it is better to give
up studying and go abroad. You will always be able to
graduate and a trip now will freshen you up, enliven you,
and get you away from moping at home. You will have a
chance to look around and stay on there to learn something
more interesting than Ilovaisky’s History or Filaret’s
Catechism (?).

Do you take good walks now? Probably not. Why shouldn’t
you go skating? Again you’ll say, “It’s dull”. But you
must not allow yourself to get so weak—that will be even
less “amusing”. You must force yourself.

About Shelgunov, I agree with you that some of his
things are out of date. Which of his articles do you like?
On Russian or historical problems? On economics or
philosophy?

Yours,

V. U.

Salzburg, May 14 (2), 1895

I am making use of a two-hour stop at a small Austrian
town (not
far,[1]

now, from my destination) to fulfil my
promise to write on the
way.[3]

This is my second day of travel abroad and I am
practising the language; I have discovered that I am weak at this
and have the greatest difficulty in understanding the
Germans—or rather, I don’t understand them at
all.[2]

I ask
the guard on the train a question, he answers and I don’t
understand him. He repeats the answer more loudly. I still
don’t understand, and so he gets angry and goes away. In
spite of this disgraceful fiasco I am not discouraged and
continue distorting the German language with some zeal.

Regards to all,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

I shall probably not be able to write another letter very
soon.

France and Germany and returned to Russia in the autumn of
1895.

May 20 (8)

I wrote the last letter on the way here. Now I have settled
down in one place. I do not think, however, that it will
be for long as I shall be moving on somewhere.

The scenery here is splendid, I am enjoying it all the
time. The Alps began immediately after the little German
station I wrote to you from; then came the lakes and I
could not tear myself away from the window of the railway
carriage; if I could find out something about local
conditions and prices (one could surely put up cheaply in the
country districts) it would perhaps be possible to spend the
summer here. The fare is not much and the scenery is splendid.

I have seen my god-daughter and her
family.[3] We
spoke, incidentally, on the subject of prices which Mark
raised.[1]

It seems that servants are very expensive here—
25 to 30 francs a month, all found—and they have to be
fed well.

Have you found a place for the summer at last? I do
not need the address, I suppose, because I can always write
to Mark, but I should
like....[2]

Paris, 8 juin 95

I received your letter just before I left for Paris. It is
a pity things turned out so badly over Mitya’s illness;
I don’t understand how they can refuse to postpone his
examination if he has a doctor’s certificate to the effect
that he has been ill. Why doesn’t he want to take the matter
further? Why should he lose a year?

Manyasha is probably finishing or has finished her
examinations by now. She ought to have a good rest this summer.

I am only just beginning to look round me a bit in Paris;
it is a huge city, spread out a good deal, so that the suburbs
(where I spend most of my time) give you no idea of the
centre. It makes a very pleasant impression—broad, light
streets, many boulevards, and lots of greenery; the people
are quite unrestrained in their manners—at first it comes
as rather a surprise after one had been accustomed to the
sedateness and primness of St. Petersburg.
I shall have to spend several weeks here to see it properly.
Lodgings here are very cheap; for instance, 30 to 35 francs
a month for two rooms and a kitchen, 6 to 10 francs a week
for a furnished room—so I hope to get fixed up without
spending too much.

Regards to all,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

18 juillet (July 6), 1895

I wrote my last letter, unless I am mistaken, on the
8th. Since then I have wandered about quite a lot and have
landed up at a Swiss spa; I have decided to take advantage of
the fact and get down seriously to the treatment of the
illness (stomach) that I am so fed up with, especially as the
doctor who runs the place has been strongly recommended
to me as a specialist in his field. I have been living at this
spa for several days and feel not at all bad; the board is
excellent and the treatment seems to be effective, so I hope
to get away from here in four or five days. The cost of living
here, as far as I can see, is very high; treatment is still
more expensive, and I have already exceeded my budget
and no longer expect to manage on my own resources. If
you can, send me another 100 rubles or so to this address:
Suisse, Zürich. Parterre. Seilergraben, 37,
H-n Grünfest[2]
[nothing else; there is no need for anything to be passed
on to
me].[1]

In any case I shall await an answer at this
address and shall not send you my address because it would
be useless—anyway, I shall be leaving here before I get an
answer.

How did you enjoy your journey down the Volga? What
was new there? Is everybody well? A letter has probably
been sent me, but I have not yet received it [the last news
I had was from Mark, in Paris—a postcard ], because I have

    

been on the move all the time. If it was sent to the Paris
address I shall receive it.

Are you having a hot summer? Here it is very hot, but
I am now living in a good place, a long way from the town,
amid greenery and close to a big lake.

Regards to all,

Yours,

V. U.

Berlin, den 10. August 1895

I do not know whether you received my last letter which
I sent from here about a week ago. I will repeat my address,
just in case: Berlin, Moabit, Flensburgerstrasse, 12II (bei
Frau Kurreick) Herrn W. Ulianoff.

I am fixed up here very well—a few steps away from
me is the Tiergarten (a splendid park, the best and biggest
in Berlin), the Spree, where I bathe every day, and a station
of the urban railway. There is a railway here that traverses
the whole town (above the streets). The trains run every
five minutes, so it is easy for me to go “to town” (Moabit,
where I am living, is actually considered a suburb).

The only bad thing is the language—I understand far
less conversational German than French. The pronunciation
of the Germans is so unlike what I am accustomed to that
I do not even understand public speeches, although in France
I understood practically everything in such speeches from
the very outset. The day before yesterday I was at the
theatre; they played Hauptmann’s The Weavers. Although
I had read the whole play beforehand in order to be able
to follow it, I could not catch all the phrases. Still, I am not
discouraged and only regret that I have too little time to
study the language thoroughly.

Regards to all,

Yours,

V. U.

If you have already sent me some money, please write
and let me know immediately; if not, send it here.

I have had no letters from you for such a long time,
probably because they (the letters) are following me around
in my wanderings.

August 29, 1895

I received your letter a few days ago, Mother dearest,
and today I also got a letter from Mark to whom I am
writing a short postscript.

I am still living in the same way and am so far pleased
with Berlin. I feel very well—perhaps the regular life [I
got tired of moving from place to place and, travelling
like that, I did not manage to eat properly or regularly],
the bathing and so on, according to doctor’s orders, are
having their effect. I am still working in the Königliche
Bibliothek[1]

and in the evenings I wander about studying
the Berlin mores and listening to German speech. I am
now getting used to it and understand it somewhat better
than before, but still very, very poorly.

I am lazy about visiting the Berlin
Sehenswürdigkeiten[2]

;
I have little taste for such things in general and in most
cases have seen them only by accident. In general, I much
prefer wandering around and seeing the evening
amusements and pastimes of the people to visiting museums,
theatres, shopping centres, etc.

I do not think I shall be staying here long—“visiting
is all very well, but there is no place like home”.

I am going to remain here for a while, however, and to
my great horror see that I am again in financial
“difficulties”; the “temptation” to buy books, etc., is so great that

  

the devil alone knows where the money goes. I must again
appeal for “philanthropy”; if you can, send me from 50 to
100 rubles.

Mark writes that your housing situation is tragic—there
is nothing at all to let. In this respect Moscow, it seems,
is worse than St. Petersburg. All this bother about a flat
is very unpleasant. I hope you soon get it settled.

Regards to all,

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

September 7 (August 26), 1895

Today I received your letter with the money, Mother
dearest, and thank you for it. I am surprised to hear of
such a great difference in the weather; you write that it is
cold in Moscow, but here it is hotter than it was all through
August, so I thought you were probably still living in the
country.

There have been no changes in my way of life here and
I have got so used to it that I feel myself almost at home
and would willingly stay longer; but the time has come
to leave and I am beginning to think of various practical
problems like buying things and a suitcase, and about
tickets, etc. Is there anything I can bring you? I can buy
anything here in some big shop; it seems to me
manufactured goods here are cheaper than ours and probably better.
Perhaps Mitya needs some books—let him write [for
instance he may need some album of anatomy, or something
else to do with medicine] and Manyasha, too. If she has
nothing in mind, you or Anyuta advise me what to bring her.
I feel I should be buying all sorts of
stuff....[1]

December 5, 1895

I received a letter from Anyuta yesterday, Mother dearest,
in which she told me that you are thinking of going with
the
Ardashevs[2] to Kazan, and I hasten to write to you.

The Ardashevs intended leaving today. D.A. has
suggested that I take on the business of proving one of his relatives’
right to an inheritance, although we have not yet come
to a complete agreement.

Life goes on as usual. I am not very pleased with the
room, first, because of the landlady’s fault-finding, and
second—it seems that the next room is separated from
mine by only a thin partition, so that everything can be
heard and sometimes I have to run away from the balalaika
with which my neighbour amuses himself right in my ear.
Up to now, this has fortunately not happened very often.
He is out most of the time, and then the rooms are very
quiet.

I do not yet know whether I shall stay here for
another
month.[3] I’ll see. In any case when the lease of my room
runs out at Christmas it will not be difficult to find
another.

The weather is very fine here now and my new overcoat
is just right for this
season.[1]

January 2, 1896

I have a plan that has occupied my mind ever since I
was arrested, and the more I think of it the more interested
I become. I have long been engaged on a certain economic
problem (on the sale of manufactured goods on the home
market). I had gathered some literature on the subject,
drawn up a plan of operations, and had even written
something, expecting to publish as a book if the size exceeds that
of an article for a journal. I am very anxious not to
abandon this work but I am apparently now faced with the
alternative—either write it here or give it up altogether.

I am well aware that the plan to write it here will meet
with many serious obstacles. Perhaps, however, it is
worth while trying.

Obstacles that one might call “independent” will, I think,
be removed. Prisoners are allowed to do literary work; I
made a special point of asking the prosecutor about this,
although I knew beforehand (even convicts in prison are
allowed to write). He also confirmed that there is no limit
to the number of books I may receive. Books, moreover,
may be returned; consequently one can make use of
libraries. And so everything is all right from that point of view.

There are other, more serious obstacles—getting the books.
I need a lot of books—I am giving a list below of those which
I have in mind at present—and to obtain them will require
a considerable amount of trouble. I do not even know
whether they can all be obtained. It will probably be all right
to count on the library of the Free Economic
Society,[7][1]
    

which allows books to be taken away for two months on
payment of a deposit, but that library is not very complete.
If it were possible to use (through some writer or
professor[2]

)

the University library or the library of the learned
committee of the Ministry of Finance, the question of obtaining
books would be settled. Some books would have to be
bought, of course, and I think I can allot a certain sum
for that.

The last and most difficult problem is that of delivering
the books. It is not merely a matter of bringing a couple
of books or so; at regular intervals, over a lengthy period
they will have to be obtained from the libraries, brought
here[3]

and taken back. That is something I do not yet
know how to arrange. Unless it can be done this way—find
some door porter or janitor, or a messenger or some boy
whom I could pay to go for books. The exchange of books—
because of the conditions under which I work and also
because of the terms on which books are lent from the
library—would, of course, have to be done correctly and
punctually, so all that must be arranged.

“Easier said than done”.... I have/a very strong feeling
that this business will not be easy to carry out and that my
“plan” may turn out to be mere fantasy. Perhaps you will
think it useful to pass this letter on to somebody, to get
some advice—and I will await an answer.

The book list is divided into the two parts into which
my essay is divided: A. The general theoretical part. This
requires fewer books and I hope, at any rate, to write this
part, even though it requires greater preparation. B. The
application of theoretical postulates to Russian data. This
part requires very many books. The chief difficulties will
be caused by (1) publications of local authorities—some of
them, incidentally, I have; some can be ordered (minor
monographs) and some can be obtained through statisticians
with whom we are acquainted; (2) government
publications—the records made by commissions, the reports and

    

minutes of congresses, etc. This is very important; it is
more difficult to get these. Some of them, probably most of
them, are in the library of the Free Economic Society.

The list I am appending is a long one, because it is drawn
up for work on an extensive
scale.[4]

If it should turn out
that certain books, or certain classes of books, cannot be
obtained, I shall have to narrow down the subject somewhat
to suit the situation. This is quite possible, especially as
concerns the second part.

I have omitted from the list books that are in the library
here; those that I have are marked with a cross.

Since I am quoting from memory I may have mixed up
some of the titles and in such cases I have placed (?) against
them.[5]

This letter was sent from prison to A. K. Chebotaryova, wife
of I. N. Chebotaryov, a close friend of the Ulyanov family; since
Lenin had boarded with the Chebotaryovs she was officially
recognised as a person to whom he was allowed to write a letter
from prison. The letter, however, was actually addressed to
acquaintances who had not been arrested,including Nadezhda
Krupskaya, and its purpose was to find out who else had been arrested
besides Lenin. To avoid mentioning names, Lenin linked up the
nicknames of his acquaintances with the contents of scientific
books he asked to be sent to him.

This is the first of the letters written in prison that have been
preserved. Here Lenin outlines his plan of work on his book
The Development of Capitalism in Russia which he began in prison
and finished in exile.

January 12, 1896

I got your parcel yesterday and just before yours
somebody else brought me food of all kinds, so I have now got
quite a stock—I could, for instance, start trading in tea,
but I don’t think it would be allowed because I should
certainly win the competition with the shop here. I eat
very little bread, I try to maintain something of a diet—and
you brought such enormous quantities that I think it will
last me almost a week and get as hard as the Sunday pie at
Oblomovka.[4]

I now have everything I need, and even more than I 

need.[1]

My health is quite satisfactory. I even get my
mineral water here—it is brought to me from the chemists’
on the day I order it. I sleep about nine hours a day and
see various chapters of my future book in my sleep.

Is Mother well, and all the rest of our family? Give my
regards to everyone.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

If you should happen to be here at any time, please bring
me a pencil, one with the lead in a metal holder. The
ordinary pencils, made of wood, are a nuisance here—knives are
not allowed. I have to ask the warders to sharpen pencils

    

and they don’t do such jobs willingly and never without
procrastination.

I should like to get the enema in an oval box that
is[2]

in the drawer of my wardrobe. This should not be
impossible, even without a letter of attorney; push 25 kopeks into
the landlady’s hand and tell her to take a cab and come here
to deliver it and get a signature for it. Unfortunately, how-
ever, this highly respected matron is as stubborn as
Korobochka.[3]

At present there is no urgent need of it, so it is
not worth buying one.

 
Notes

Someone, for instance, brought me a frock coat, waistcoat and
travelling rug. All this was immediately “dispatched” to the
storeroom as superfluous.—Lenin

In Goncharov’s novel Oblomov there is a passage which speaks
of a gigantic pie that was baked on holidays; the master’s family
ate it for two days and on the third and fourth days it went to
the servant girls; the pie lived on until Friday, when one corner
of it, already hard, and without any of the filling, found its way
to Antip who crossed himself and with a loud noise set fearlessly
about the destruction of that amazing fossil....

January 14, 1896

Yesterday I received your letter of the 12th and am
sending you a second letter of attorney. Actually I am
not sure it is necessary; yesterday I got some of my things,
which made me think my first letter giving power of
attorney had been received. In any case I am sending one, in
answer to your letter and Alexandra Kirillovna’s. Now I
have underclothes and everything—quite enough; do not
send any underclothes as there is nowhere to keep
them. But they can be sent to the storeroom, so as to end
the matter once and for all.

I am very thankful to A.K. for the trouble she took about
the dentist; I am ashamed of having caused so much bother.
The dentist does not require a special pass because the
prosecutor has already given permission and I did not even
write to the dentist until I had received it. The day and
time he comes does not matter. I cannot guarantee that I
will not be absent—under interrogation, for instance—but
I think the sooner he comes the greater the chance of
avoiding that obstacle, which is not likely to occur in any case.
I shall not write to Mr. Dobkovich (the dentist, assistant
to Vazhinsky); he lives next to my former lodgings
(Gorokhovaya, 59) and perhaps you will go to him and explain
matters.

Regarding my own books, I have sent a list of those I
should like to
get.[1]

Thanks for the books by Golovin and
Schippel sent yesterday. From my own books I must add

    

only dictionaries. I am doing a translation from the
German[2]

and would ask you to send me Pavlovsky’s
dictionary.

I was sent some underclothes, apparently not mine;
they must be returned. When you are here you must ask
them to bring you the underclothes and things I don’t need—
and I will hand them over.

I am quite well.

V. Ulyanov

I am very glad to hear that Mother and Mark are better
now.

 
Notes

The book list has been lost.—Ed.

January  16, 1896

Yesterday I received your letter of the 14th and hasten
to answer it, although there is not much hope of your
receiving my reply before
Thursday.[3]

I have already written about the need to return some
underclothes that do not belong to me. I have got the things
together and you must now ask for them when you are
here, or tell whoever comes to ask for them in your name.
I am not returning all of the things, because some are in
the wash (perhaps you will ask somebody to get the rest
later); I have allowed myself to keep, for the time being,
a travelling rug that has done me excellent service here.

I have obtained information about the books; a small
box may be left in the storeroom
here.[1]

It is not, of course,
worth while sending all my books here. Some of the books
in the list you sent me are not mine—for example,
Fabrichnaya promyshlennost, Kobelyatsky—these are Alexandra
Kirillovna’s and I think I took another book from her.
Then the publications of the Saratov
Zemstvo[4] and the
Zemstvo statistical reports for Voronezh Gubernia were lent
me, I believe, by some statistician. Perhaps you will find
out whether they can be kept for a time. It is not worth
while bringing them here. Pogozhev and Sbornik
obyazatelnikh postanovleni po SPB are not mine either, I think
(could they be from the library?). The legal codes and

    

textbooks are obviously not needed at all. At the moment
the only books I should like you to bring me are Ricardo,
Beltov, N.—on, Ingram, and Foville. The Zemstvo
publications (Tver, Nizhny Novgorod and Saratov) should be
counted and be tied up in a
bundle,[2]

but do not bother to list
them; I think you can also deliver that bundle to the
storeroom. Then you will be finished with my books and not
have to bother about them again. I shall be able to get the
books from the storeroom (after they have been examined).

I am afraid I am causing you too much trouble. Please
do not work too hard, especially in delivering books
according to the list; there will be time for everything, and at the
moment I have enough books.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Please add some pillow-slips and towels to the list of linen.

I am re-reading Shelgunov with interest and am busy
with Tugan-Baranovsky; he has published a sound piece
of research but his diagrams, those at-the end, for instance,
are so confused that I must confess I do not understand
them; I shall have to get Volume II of Capital.

 
Notes
 

[1]
You can put a few clothes in there, too—an overcoat and suit,
a hat. The waistcoat, frock coat and rug that were brought me can be
taken back.—Lenin

Thursday and Monday were visiting days in the remand prison.
Lenin’s mother and his sister Maria visited him on Mondays,
when they were allowed a half-an-hour’s personal visit; his other
sister. Anna, visited him on Thursdays, when she was allowed
a longer time but had to converse with him through a grille. Anna
brought him books and carried on a correspondence in code.





[4]
Zemstvo—a local government body headed by the local nobility
in the central gubernias of tsarist Russia; Zemstvos were
introduced in 1864. The competence of the Zemstvos was very limited
(the building of hospitals and roads, statistics, insurance, etc.).
The activities of the Zemstvos were under the supervision of the
governor and the Ministry of the Interior, who could annul any
orders the government did not approve of.

Ob Station. March 2[3]

I am writing to you once more while I am on my way,
Mother dearest. The halt here is a long one and there is
nothing to do, and I have decided to write yet another
letter en route, my third. I still have two more days’ journey
ahead of me. I drove across the Ob in a horse-sleigh and
bought tickets to Krasnoyarsk. Since traffic here is still
“temporary”, I had to pay the old rates, which meant
handing over 10 rubles for a ticket and 5 rubles for luggage
for something like 700 versts! The way the trains run here
is beyond all bounds. To do that 700 versts we shall crawl
for forty-eight hours. Beyond Krasnoyarsk, the railway
goes only as far as Kansk, i.e., for 220 versts—and
altogether to Irkutsk it is about 1,000 versts. And so I shall
have to go on by road—if I have to go at all. Another 24
hours is taken up by those 220 versts on the railway; the
further you go, the slower the trains crawl along.

You have to use a horse-sleigh to cross the Ob because
the bridge is not ready, although its skeleton has been built.
The crossing was not too bad—but I was able to manage
without warm (or rather the warmest) clothing only because
it was a short one—less than an hour. If I have to go to
my destination by road (and I most probably shall have to),
I shall obviously have to acquire a sheepskin coat, felt boots
and even, perhaps, a fur cap (you see how spoiled I was in
Russia! But how else am I expected to travel by sleigh?).

Despite the devilish slowness of the journey it has tired
me far less than I expected. I may even say that I am
hardly tired at all. I am surprised at this myself, because before

    

this a journey of some three days from Samara to St.
Petersburg would wear me out. The fact of the matter most
probably is that I sleep very well every night without exception.
The country covered by the West-Siberian Railway that I
have just travelled throughout its entire length (1,300 versts
from Chelyabinsk to Krivoshchokovo—three days) is
astonishingly monotonous—bare, bleak steppe. No sign of life, no
towns, very rarely a village or a patch of forest—and for
the rest, all steppe. Snow and sky—and nothing else for
the whole three days. They say that further on there will
be taiga, and after that, beginning at Achinsk, mountains.
The air in the steppe, however, is wonderful; breathing is
so easy. There is a hard frost, more than twenty degrees
below, but it is easier to bear here than in Russia. It does
not seem to me that it is twenty below. The Siberians say
it is because the air is “soft”, and that makes the frost easier
to bear. Quite probably it is so.

In the train I met the
Arzt[1]

that Anyuta visited in St.
Petersburg. I learned a few things from him about
Krasnoyarsk, etc., that will be useful to me. He said that I should
definitely be able to stay there for a few days. That is what
I think of doing, in order to find out what my position in
the future will be. If I send a telegram “staying a few days”
that will mean that the length of my stay is not known
even to me. And so I shall wait there for the
doctor,[2]

meet
him, and if I do have to go on to Irkutsk, we shall go together.
According to that same person, I cannot expect any delay
in my being appointed a place; most probably it has been
decided already because the whole thing is arranged
beforehand. And so, until next time.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

P.S. Accuse me of anything you like except infrequent
letters! When there is something to write about—I write
very often.
 

My talk with the Arzt has made very much clear to me
(even if only approximately), and for this reason I feel
quite calm; I have left my nervousness behind in Moscow.
It was due to the uncertainty, nothing more. Now there
is less uncertainty and I therefore feel better.

This letter was sent by Lenin on his way to exile in Siberia.

On January 29, 1897, the sentence of exile in Eastern Siberia 
 for three
years under the surveillance of the police was confirmed. 
 Lenin obtained
permission to go to his place of exile at his own 
 expense and not under
escort; he was ordered in his travel permit 
 to report to the
Governor-General of Irkutsk for further 
-7 instructions. Lenin did not go
as far as Irkutsk, but remained in 
-4 Krasnoyarsk to await an answer to
his application sent on March 6, 
 for the permission of the
Governor-General to remain in 
-6 Krasnoyarsk or Minusinsk District of
Yenisei Gubernia.

Manyasha,

I got your letter from the doctor and was very glad to
have some news from home. I have received the bag Mother
sent and think it will be very convenient. I shall probably
take advantage of your proposal to make extracts from
books in the Rumyantsev
Library.[3] Yesterday I managed
to find the famous local library belonging to Yudin, who
gave me a hearty welcome and showed me his collection.
He gave me permission to work in the library and I think
I shall be able to. (There are two obstacles in the way;
first, his library is outside the town, although the distance
is short, about two versts, so it will make a pleasant walk;
second, the library is not fully organised, so I may be a
nuisance to the owner by making frequent requests for
books.) We’ll see how it works out in practice. I think the
second obstacle, too, will be removed. I have not seen all
his library by far, but in any case it is an excellent
collection of books. There are, for example, complete sets of
journals (the most important) from the end of the eighteenth
century up to date. I hope I shall be able to make use of
them for the information I need so much for my work.

I see from the newspapers that in the spring fast trains
will be coming here—8 days from
Paris[1]

to Krasnoyarsk,
which means six days from Moscow. It will then be much
more convenient to correspond.

Yours,

V. U.

March 15, 1897

All this time I have been on the look-out for letters from
you, Mother dearest, but so far in vain; enquiries at the post
office tell me nothing. I am beginning to think that you
have not written to me because you are waiting for the
telegram I did not manage to send on arrival. In view
of the great length of postage time between us (i.e., letters
taking too long en route), you must write without waiting
for an address. If I am sent away from here I will leave word
at the post office for letters to be forwarded. So please write
to me more often to the last address known to you—I am
miserable without letters from home. All I have had is
Manyasha’s note, brought by the doctor.

Today I said good-bye to the doctor. He went on to
Irkutsk. He was not allowed to stay here any longer, i.e.,
the local authorities would not allow it. So far I am not
being troubled and I do not think they can bother me
because I have sent an application to the Governor-General
and am now awaiting a reply. Incidentally, it is not
absolutely impossible that I, too, shall have to make that journey.
In these parts the spring thaw is considered to begin from
today and a journey by post horses becomes more expensive
and more difficult. The weather is excellent, real spring
weather. I spend my time here in two ways—first, in
visiting Yudin’s library, and second, in getting to know the
town of Krasnoyarsk and its inhabitants (many of them
exiles).[1] I go to the library every day and since it is two
versts from the outskirts of the town I have to walk some
five versts; it takes about an hour. I am very glad to have
the walk and enjoy it, although it sometimes makes me quite

    

sleepy. There turned out to be far fewer books on my subject
in the library than might have been expected from its
general size; nevertheless there are some that are useful to
me and I am very glad that I do not have to waste my time
here completely. I also visit the town library, where I can
see journals and newspapers that arrive here on the eleventh
day after publication, but I cannot get used to such old
“news”. If I have to live a few hundred versts from here,
the post will take still longer and it will be still more
necessary to write frequently without waiting for a reply; if you
wait for a reply it will be more than a month!

It is a great pity nothing is known about the
party.[2]
I have quite given up expecting a telegram from Anyuta
and have decided that either she has not been able to find
out anything, or that there has been a delay. I have heard
that no more columns are to come here on foot, which
means that the party will come by rail. If that is so, I cannot
understand why they are being delayed in Moscow. Will
it be possible to pass books on? Food? Letters? If these
questions are not too late I should be very glad to get an
answer to them from Anyuta.


March 16. I missed the post yesterday. The train for
Russia leaves here late at night, but the station is a long way
away.

Many kisses for you and my regards to everyone.
Tomorrow, perhaps, I shall try at last to send off to Anyuta the
books that were borrowed for a short time.

Yours,

V. U.

Did my letter with the address arrive? Just in case, I
shall repeat it—Bolshekachenskaya Street, House of
Klavdiya Popova. You may also write Poste restante and I
will ask for letters at the post office. When I leave here,
letters will be forwarded.

When he was in Krasnoyarsk Lenin maintained friendly relations
with P. A. Krasikov, V. A. Bukshnis, N. A. Merkhalev, A.A.

V. N. Kudryashev.

Letter No. 19





[2]
This refers to a party of exiles who were going to Siberia at the
cost of the state. Among them were some of Lenin’s closest
associates in the St. Petersburg League of Struggle—G. M.
Krzhizhanovsky, Y. O. Zederbaum (L. Martov), A. A. Vaneyev and
V. V. Starkov. The party was held up because of badly organised
transport. They did not arrive in Krasnoyarsk until April 4, 1897.
At the station Lenin met those of his comrades who arrived with
this party of exiles.

March 26, 1897

At last, Mother dearest, I have received news of you
and am very glad. First, I have received a telegram in
answer to mine. I had inquired at the station but there
was nothing there. The
Schwester[1]

found your letter there
later, and Anyuta’s must, therefore, have been lost.
Secondly, I got a telegram just after nine yesterday evening
saying they were leaving, was overjoyed about it and ran
headlong to the Schwester to share my joy with her. Now we are
counting the days and are “travelling” by the mailtrain
that left Moscow on the 25th. The last telegram I understood
to mean that they are travelling at their own expense,
otherwise it would not have been signed by Gleb. I think he has
also sent a telegram to his
mother[4] in Chelyabinsk,
otherwise he might travel past her while she is sitting and
waiting for news! (The Schwester’s letter to her was posted not
long ago, so she will probably not yet have left.) I am very
thankful to Manyasha for her letter and for the extracts
from letters received. I am enclosing herewith a reply to
one of those extracts—let Manyasha deal with it as before.
I count on exploiting her further for letter-writing and
even for literary work. You may send me books and letters
here; I don’t know yet when they’ll chase me out and where
to. It would probably be better to send them to the
Schwester, and register the more important ones for there seems to
be a terrible lot of carelessness at the post office here and
letters, apparently, get lost (to that, I suppose, must be
added outside
hindrances[2]

).
 

There is nothing new I can write about myself; my life
goes on as usual. I stroll to the library outside town, I stroll
in the neighbourhood, I stroll round to my acquaintances
and sleep enough for two—in short, everything is as it
should be.

Yours,

V.U.

I am sending Anyuta a list of those books I should very
much like to obtain and which, it seems, can be bought only
in the St. Petersburg second-hand bookshops, so you will
have to write to the =q

director[3]

and ask him to do it or get
somebody else to. I am very angry with myself for getting
one name wrong (or rather, one year) in a letter from the
remand prison, and making Anyuta travel about for
nothing. Could not a search also be made in the Moscow
libraries? Perhaps they are to be found somewhere.

1. Yezhegodnik Ministerstva finansov, St. Petersburg,
1869, First Issue.

2. Statistichesky vremennik Rossiiskoi imperii, published
by the Central Statistical Committee of the Ministry of the
Interior.

Second Series, Sixth Issue: Materialy dlya statistiki
fabrichno-zavodskoi promyshlennosti v Yevropeiskoi Rossii
za 1868 god. Edited by I. Bock. St. Petersburg, 1872.

3. Statistichesky atlas glavneishikh otraslei fabrichno-za 
vodskoi promyshlennosti Yevropeiskoi Rossii s poimennym
spiskom fabrik i zavodov. Compiled by D. Timiryazev
.Third Issue. St. Petersburg, 1873 (I found the first two
issues here in Yudin’s library. The original price of the three
books was (1) 2 rubles, (2) 1 ruble and (3) 1 ruble 50 kopeks,
but they are not on sale).

April 5, 1897

Today there was good news, Mother dearest, and I hasten
to tell you about it. First, I received a telegram from the
doctor in Irkutsk, “Hear you being sent Minusinsk”.
Secondly, A. M. has at last learned the Governor-General’s reply—
Gleb and Basil are also being sent to Minusinsk District.
E.E. will be arriving tomorrow and will press for their
release and also ask permission for them to travel at their own
expense. I expect she will succeed (judging by precedents
we know
of).[1]

I am very pleased with my place of exile (if the rumours
prove true, and I do not think they are wrong) because
Minusinsk and its district are the best in these parts both
on account of the excellent climate and the low cost of
living. The distance from Krasnoyarsk is not very great,
the post goes there two or three times a week, so that to
send a letter and get an answer will take 30 to 35 days
instead of the present 22 or 23 days—no more. I do not expect
I shall be able to leave before the river is open to navigation,
because the spring thaw and floods are now at their height
and the party on its way to Irkutsk is being kept here until
May. When the river is open to navigation it is possible to
go to Minusinsk by steamer.

It is a great pity no attempt was made to get Anatoly
Alexandrovich sent to Minusinsk District, too; it would
be very, very good for him after the pleurisy he has had.
We sent a telegram to St. Petersburg asking them to set
things going; since there has been a delay of the whole
party there is now ample time, so we may hope they will

    

be able to get him sent there if they tackle the job
energetically.

For the time being letters should, of course, be sent to
me at the old address; if I go away I will leave the new
address and they will be sent on to me. I think you can
send my books on now, without waiting for the final address;
in any case you cannot send goods to Minusinsk (there is no
carrier’s office there), and they take a long time to come
here by rail. So send them here, to A. M.’s address, if no
other, or, better still, addressed to the bearer of the receipt,
and send the receipt by registered post to A. M. From here
the goods can be sent on to Minusinsk by boat in the spring.

They say that Gleb and Basil look very ill—pale, yellow
and terribly tired. They will probably get better when they
come out.

I am in good health and am living quite well; the weather
is marvellous. I intend to write Manyasha a letter in a
“literary” vein; I do not know, however, whether that
intention will be put into effect. I have seen Novoye
Slovo[2] and
read it with great pleasure.

Regards to all,


Yours,
V. U.

April 17, 1897

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received three of your
letters. Today I collected some detailed information about
the villages we are being sent to (officially I have not yet
been informed of
this[8]). I am going to the village of
Shushinskoye (I think I spelt it wrongly in previous letters—
Shushinskoye). It is a big village with more than fifteen
hundred inhabitants, where there are the volost council,
the office of the Zemstvo assessor (he is the same as a
superintendent of police in Russia, but has greater powers), a
school, etc. The village stands on the right bank of the
Yenisei, fifty-six versts to the south of Minusinsk. Since the
volost authorities are quartered there the post will be
fairly regular—I have heard there is a post twice a week.
You go by steamer to Minusinsk (the steamers do not go
further up the Yenisei) and by horse transport the rest
of the way. Today the ice broke on the Yenisei, so in seven
to ten days the steamers will probably begin and I expect
to leave at the end of April or the beginning of May. You
can and should write to my present
address,[1]

because I
shall leave a request to forward my letters when I go. I
cannot, however, tell you exactly when I shall be going.
Gleb and Basil are going to the village of Tesinskoye, also
the seat of a volost council, etc., thirty-seven versts to the
north of Minusinsk on the River Tuba (a right tributary of
the Yenisei). A telegram about them was sent to the Police

    

Department today asking for permission for them to travel
at their own expense. I hope the permission will be granted
at the mother’s request, she is ill all the time here, and then
we shall go to Minusinsk together. I shall, therefore, spend
the summer in “Siberian Italy”, as the people here call the
south of Minusinsk District. I cannot yet say whether this
name is deserved or not, but people say that the Krasnoyarsk
region is not so good. The environs along the River Yenisei
of even this town, incidentally, remind me of Zhiguli or of
Swiss scenery; I have recently taken a number of walks (the
days were quite warm here and the roads are already dry)
and have enjoyed them very much. I should have enjoyed
them more if it were not for thoughts of our Turukhansk
people and our Minusinsk
prisoners.[9]

I live very well here; I have comfortable lodgings, and am
especially pleased with the full board. For my work I have
obtained some books on statistics (I think I have already
written about
that[2]

)

but I do not do much work; mostly
I just roam about the place.

Thank Manyasha for her letter; I have given her so much
work now that I am afraid she will get fed up with
figures.[10]
My books should be sent to Krasnoyarsk to be delivered
to the bearer of the receipt (either by goods train or through
a carrier’s office, whichever is better) and I will then ask
acquaintances to send them on to Minusinsk, and there
again I shall have to look for acquaintances—there is no other
way.

Why is Mitya thinking of going where there is
plague?[11]
If he is so anxious to travel and practice medicine I am
ready to suggest a place at some resettlement centre. In
Eastern Siberia, for instance. I have heard, incidentally
, that a resettlement centre is to be opened in “my” village
of Shushenskoye, Minusinsk District, Yenisei Gubernia....
So he is welcome. We can go shooting together—if only
Siberia can manage to make a sportsman out of me, and if
he does not find work (and shooting) for himself in places
not so far distant.... Ho, ho! If in three weeks and a bit
I have become such a Siberian that I am inviting people
from “Russia”, what shall I be like in three years? All

    

jokes aside, however, I really am surprised at his “plague”
plans; I hope there will not be any plague, and that he
will not have to go there.

Yours,

V. U.

Anyuta,

About books—how to send them, see above. What to
send? If I get a fee of some 150
rubles[12] (perhaps in three
doses, a teaspoonful every hour—every month, that is),
then you can spend some on books. Then buy me the last
three issues of Promysly Vladimirskoi gubernii (3 rubles
75 kopeks), Vliyaniye urozhayev, etc., by Chuprov and
Posnikov (5 rubles), Ukazatel fabrik i zavodov za 1890 god
, St. Petersburg, 1894 (5 rubles?). I will give you further
titles later—depending on the size of the fee, which need
not be sent all at once (to the Schwester, of course).
Write and tell the
writer[3]

that I should be very glad if
he would let me have part of my fee, and if he would agree
to send me books instead of money—Russian and foreign,
some for review and others for myself. He knows the subjects
I am interested in and he could send the books to you. I
should be glad to take all sorts of things for translation and
could distribute them among the people in Minusinsk and
Turukhansk[4]

(not very urgent), taking the organisation of
the work upon myself and guaranteeing its timely and
correct fulfilment. That, however, is something special, but I
should very much like to arrange for the fees to be paid in
books—only if that will not be too much trouble for the
writer[5]

(add this, word for word).

I think I shall have to subscribe to journals and
newspapers—there probably will not be anything in Shushenskoye.
Depending on available finances, you may subscribe to

    

Russkiye Vedomosti, Russkoye Bogatstvo, Vestnik
Finansov[13] (without any supplements), Archiv für soziale
Gesetzgebung und
Statistik.[14] That makes quite a lot, so they
may be ordered only if there are big receipts. If money is
short, Russkiye Vedomosti will, perhaps, be enough. You
will see for yourself, especially when I write from
Shushenskoye and inform you of my budget. (I believe you are angry
with the écrivain; when you write to him in my name, do
not show it. I bear no
“rancune”[6]

because of the loss of my 
 last
“literature”.[7]

It was not his fault at all.)

Send my best regards to the
Bulochkins.[15] Why do you
not write about them in greater detail? What sort of finale
 was there? Could there have been none at all? That would
be excellent. If opportunity offers, give my regards to other
acquaintances, the bookseller and others.

V. U.

I hope you will inform me beforehand when you intend
to go to the West, so that I shall have time to write to you
and give you many, many things to do for me.

I rely entirely on his choice, and this method of payment

it held Narodnik liberal views and in 1906 became an organ of

(whose nickname was “Bulochka”, Russian for “bread roll”)
and her sisters Sofia and Avgusta; Zinaida and Sofia were arrested
in 1896 in connection with the League of Struggle for the
Emancipation of the Working Class. Apparently Lenin used the surname
“Bulochkin” in the plural to include Nadezhda Krupskaya, who
was arrested on August 12, 1896. “What sort of finale was there?”
means “What sentence was passed on them?”

Minusinsk, May 7, 1897

We arrived here, Mother dearest, only
yesterday.[1]
Tomorrow we intend to go to our villages, and I wanted to
write to you in greater detail about our journey here, which
proved to be very expensive and very uncomfortable (so
there is no sense in your coming here), but I don’t know
whether I shall manage it because today I am quite worn
out after the journey and tomorrow I shall probably be
even busier. If I do not manage to write in greater detail
tomorrow, I shall confine myself to what is written here,
so that you have some news of me, and will postpone a
detailed letter until I arrive at “Shu-shu-shu”... as I call
the place where I shall eventually find peace.

Yours,

V. U.

May 18, 1897

This week, Mother dearest, I received two letters from
you (dated April 20 and 24) and am answering the latter
by the first post from here, which leaves this evening.
Write and tell me when you get the letter from here, on
which day, that is. Your letters took so long to reach me
because they were forwarded from Krasnoyarsk and a lot
of time was wasted sending them on. About finance—I
do not remember your asking me twice (as you write in your
letter of April 24), or perhaps I have forgotten it. As
long as my finances were good I did not write. But before
I left Krasnoyarsk (about the 26th or 28th), I sent a
registered letter with a request for some money, which is
probably now on its way here from
Krasnoyarsk[4]. Later, I also
wrote from here saying that I should have enough for about
a fortnight.

As far as concerns your idea of coming here only to beg
a change of residence for me—it is really not worth while.
First, I could probably obtain permission to move myself,
if I were to set about it. Secondly, the village of Tesinskoye
is hardly likely to be any better than Shusha. According
to the preliminary information we gathered earlier,
Tesinskoye is much worse than Shusha as a place, for the
shooting, etc. Thirdly, the journey here is not so simple—I have
already written about this and will write again today in
greater detail to Manyasha; she accuses me (I am joking, of
course) of “being horribly inhospitable”. So far I have had no
letters from
Tesinskoye[5], but as I know nothing about them
I shall not do anything; it is possible they will ask to be sent

    

somewhere else if Tes turns out in reality to be as bad as
we have heard.

Shu-shu-shu is not a bad village. It is true it is in a rather
bare locality, but not far away (one and a half to two versts)
there is a forest, although much of it has been felled. There
is no road to the Yenisei but the River Shush flows right
past the village and there is a fairly big tributary of the
Yenisei not far away (one or one and a half versts), where
you can bathe. The Sayan Mountains or spurs from them are
visible on the horizon; some of them are quite white, the
snow on them probably never melts. And so we have
something artistic here, too; it was not for nothing that when
I was in Krasnoyarsk I tried writing verses “In Shusha at
Sayan’s foot...” but, unfortunately, I got no further than
the first line!

I am surprised that you do not write a word about sending
me the remainder of the books. It would be a pity if they
have not yet been sent (I wrote about this a long time ago
from
Krasnoyarsk[1]

).

Now the steamers will be going as
far as Minusinsk (the water is rising rapidly), so a bale
can easily be sent here. Later it will be difficult again, for
the Yenisei has lots of shallows, and high water will not
last long. Perhaps, however, the books have been sent?

As for my complaints that you do not write very often,
that is all a matter of the past and was due to the amazing
(for us, who are unaccustomed to such things) delay in
receiving answers to our letters. I remember I wrote about
it a month or six weeks ago, so it must have referred to the
letters you wrote at the end of March! I now receive letters
more often than before and I do not think that they get
lost because the loss of some would be revealed when the
next were received. Apparently not a single letter has gone
astray, except the first one that Anyuta sent to the station.
Here in the village I shall have to work still harder at my
correspondence, so it will be better if letters come more
frequently from “Russia”.

You say that “Anya says the reply to the editors has
been read”. I do not quite understand this. Did she read
the reply herself or have the editors already had time to

    

read it? Does Anya know any details about the dispute
with the editors, about the war against them by
gold-prospector and company? Has she heard the “other side”,
i.e., somebody from the editorial
office?[6] I am waiting
for a letter from her. Have you subscribed to a paper for me?
I have no papers at all here. They are also needed in
Minusinsk since there is no reading-room there.

Regards to Mark. He never lets me know how he is. I
can inform him and Mitya that the shooting here,
apparently, is not at all bad. Yesterday I travelled about 12 versts
to shoot duck and great snipe. There is a lot of game, but
without a dog the shooting is difficult, especially for such
a poor shot as I. There are even wild goats, and in the
mountains and in the taiga (30-40 versts from here, where
the local peasants sometimes go shooting) there are squirrel,
sable, bear and deer.

I am sorry I did not take a waterproof. It is indispensable
here. Could you send me one in a small parcel? I do not know
when I shall next be in town or whether I should find
anything suitable in such a town-cum-village as Minusinsk.
Perhaps I shall also ask Mark (if there is any money) to
buy me a good revolver; but so far, I do not see the need
for it.

Yours,

V. U.

What news is there of
Columbus?[2]

I have heard that
he is married and is ill. Do you know anything about him?

Anatoly and Yuly have again been put in prison; they
did not want to leave before navigation begins and so the
Governor-General ordered them to wait in gaol! The
steamer for Yeniseisk is supposed to leave Krasnoyarsk some
time after May 20.

May 18, 1897 
 

Manyasha,

I have received the extracts you made. A big merci for
them. I shall probably not be able to study them in detail

    

until autumn, for at the moment I am mostly loafing
around doing nothing. I cannot yet say whether I shall
need anything else or what it might be.

As for my being “horribly inhospitable”, I shall dispute
that with you. Before one can be hospitable, i.e., receive
guests, must one not first know where one is going to
live? That is something I did not know when I was in
Krasnoyarsk. The “Shu-shu-shu” that I hear and repeat
cannot be called knowledge when I have no idea of how
to get to that Shu-shu-shu, of what the place is like or
how I shall live there, etc. And before being hospitable one
must know for certain that the guests can reach you and be
lodged, I will not say comfortably, but at least reasonably
well. I have not been able to say this until very recently,
that is, until the middle of May. You will most likely read
my letter in June. This means that it will take the better
half of the summer to pass on information and make
preparations. Does this make sense? You have, of course, already
learnt from my letter describing the journey by road that
a trip here is quite a troublesome affair and rather
unpleasant. It was a good thing that the weather was excellent—
but what if there had been rain! The weather here is
changeable in the extreme. Yesterday I went shooting. In the
morning the weather was wonderful and it was hot, a
real summer’s day. In the evening a terribly cold wind
sprang up with rain into the bargain. We came home
plastered with mud and if we had not had fur coats would have
frozen on the way. The local folk say that such happenings
are not infrequent in summer and so they take fur coats
with them even in summer when they
travel.[3]

Until I have
settled down and looked the place over I ought not to
invite people here.

In any case, if ever you do come here, I shall have to send
a telegram from Minusinsk in advance to tell you whether
steamers are going as far as the town and whether
navigation is reliable. If not, it may happen that the steamer will
take you only half way. The Yenisei forms numerous bars
and shallows, so navigation as far as Minusinsk is very

    

short-lived and you have to “catch” it. Even now I don’t
know for certain whether steamers are going as far as
Minusinsk—I think they are, because the water is rising very fast.

Incidentally, about telegrams. Our “postman” (the one
who serves our volost) is in Minusinsk on Thursdays and
Mondays (the days the post arrives in Minusinsk). If you
have to send telegrams, therefore, the best time is on
Wednesday or Sunday, i.e., so that they arrive in Minusinsk
on Thursday or Monday morning. Then I get them on
Tuesday or Friday morning. Of course they can be sent for
delivery by messenger on another day, but that is much
more expensive and is only for emergencies.

 


In general I am very surprised that you are unwilling
to go abroad. Can it possibly be more interesting to stay
in some village near Moscow? If you travel to Moscow to
take music lessons, can you not also travel to the nearest
town from there? Incidentally, I think you will be reading
this letter somewhere abroad.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

Send me all sorts of catalogues, especially of second-hand
books, and especially of foreign books.

May 25, 1897

The day before yesterday I received your letter of May 5,
Mother dearest, and am answering by the first post. I, too,
am now wondering how it could have happened that I did
not write for a long time at the end of April; I must have
missed a day or two because of the fuss and bustle at that
time, but after that I wrote very frequently, both before
my departure from Krasnoyarsk and on the way here. From
here I have also been writing frequently—every week.
There really is nothing to write more frequently about;
by the way, I answer all letters immediately, so I may
sometimes have written twice in one week.

I have no information about the health of E.E. now—she
must be better because no one at Tesinskoye writes anything
about it. She was pretty badly exhausted by the journey,
especially the road journey, and was anxious to reach the
village and rest. I really do not remember your letter to
her, addressed to me, I may have passed it on and forgotten
it.

I simply roared with laughter when I read in your letter
that Mitya, “the queer fish”, is not coming here! I wrote
that as a
joke![1]

What sense would there be in his trekking
a distance of 4,500 versts and losing a month (there and
back) on the journey for the sake of the joys of Shu-shu-shu!
I am sorry that you are so long in making up your, mind

    

what to do in summer because of me and are missing the
best time and the best accommodation, etc.

It is a pity that the books were sent so late (if they have
been sent—you write that you will be sending them “in
a day or two”). I thought they were already on the way.
I shall now have to find out when they will arrive in
Krasnoyarsk. Probably not before the end of summer!

Life here is not bad, I go shooting quite a lot; I have
got to know the local sportsmen and go shooting with
them.[7] I have begun bathing; up to now I have had to go
quite a long way, about two and a half versts, but soon I
shall be able to go to a place about a verst and a half away.
Such distances mean nothing to me because, apart from
shooting and bathing, I spend a lot of time walking. I am
longing for newspapers; I hope I shall soon be receiving
them now that you have sent them.

I have had a letter from Basil in Tesinskoye. He says
it is an awful place, quite bare, neither forest nor river near
(there is one two versts away—too far for him!), no
shooting and no fishing. And so, if anyone moves at all, they
will have to come here, since there is no point in my going
there. A.M. visited them for one day (May 14) from Kras-
noyarsk; she came with a resettlement party, and then
went back to Krasnoyarsk; she intends to go to Tesinskoye
soon to live there.

Regards to all,


Yours,


V. U.

May 25, 1897 
 

Anyuta,

I am very sorry to hear that your trip abroad is hanging
fire because of me. I am fixed up here so well (certainly
better than any of the other comrades) that there is no
need at all for Mother to worry about me, and as far as a
summer holiday is concerned I think that she can get a
better rest abroad than in this place, since she would have
to travel thousands of versts on all kinds of transport. By
the way, I expect all this is superfluous now—meaning
the “now” when you will be reading this letter.
 

At first I couldn’t understand why you wrote in your
letter, “I repeat that I do not show him,
etc.”[8]—but then
I remembered that I had spoken to you about it, in Moscow
or even, I think, in St. Petersburg. I had completely
forgotten it—there was so much confusion there—otherwise
I, would not have spoken about it a second time. I imagine
that the editor is up to his ears in work and for that reason
does not give any but purely business
information.[2]

In
view of this my request for books in payment of fees was
probably out of place; how would he find time to bother
about such a relatively troublesome business? If you have
not yet written to him about this, please don’t write. The
fee I received for the first article will last me about a year,
when added to my
allowance[9]—and the remainder for
the next two
articles[10] I am thinking of using for journals
and books. (I do not know bow much you have already
sent me; 30 or 40 rubles would be enough and the rest can
go for journals.)

As regards journals, I have already
written[3]

(in any case
I am repeating it, although I think that some of them, at
least, have been sent here) that you should subscribe to
(1) Russkoye Bogatstvo, (2) Russkiye
Vedomosti,[4]

(3) Vestnik
Finansov (from the beginning of the year), (4) Soziale
Praxis, (5) Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik
(herausgegeben von Braun). I think I have also written partly
about books, especially about Ukazatel fabrik i zavodov
,third edition, St. Petersburg, 1894 (I think it costs 5
rubles) and the book by Chuprov and Posnikov on grain
prices.[5]

If they have not been sent with the other books
(which would be a pity because in that case they will be
travelling about three months), then please send them by
post as printed matter. These are the books (and also the

    

Yezhegodnik if you managed to find it) that I need more
than any others for my work. Please send me direct any
particularly interesting new books, so that I shall get them
quicker and shall not lag too far behind. By the way, if
a report of the Free Economic Society’s discussions on grain
prices (in connection with the book by Chuprov and
Posnikov) has been published, send it to
me[11].

I am still thinking about the possibility of using a Moscow
library; have you managed to do anything about it, i.e., have
you managed to join some public library? If it is possible
to take out books for two months (as you can in St.
Petersburg at the library of the Free Economic Society) it
would not cost very much to send them by post as printed
matter (16 kopeks a pound, and you can send 4 pounds for
64 kopeks, and 7 kopeks to register them), so it would
probably be more profitable for me to spend money on postage and
have a lot of books than to spend much more money on buying
a few books. I imagine that it would be much more
convenient for me; the only problem is whether you can get books
for such a long period (leaving a deposit, of course) from
some good library—the
University,[6]

or the library of the
Moscow Bar Association (you must get information from
there, get their catalogue and find out the terms for the
acceptance of new members, etc.), or some other. There are
probably a number of good libraries in Moscow. You can
even find out about private libraries. If any of you are
staying on in Moscow they can probably find out about all
this.

If you go abroad, write to me and I will send you details
of books from there. Send me more catalogues of all kinds
of second-hand books, etc. (libraries, bookshops).

Yours,

V. U.
 

As far as news from St. Petersburg is concerned I have
almost lost all hope; there is nobody to expect a letter from,
I’ve already given up hope of the director.

When you write to the Bulochkins send them my regards.
They should send me their photographs in exchange for
mine. How are their affairs going on?

He should send the journal directly to my address; tell him that.
The money should be sent to you.
—Lenin

[3]
See Letter No. 22.—Ed.

[4]
Perhaps you will calculate whether it would not be a saving
to send me your copy when you have read it. If you arrange it to fit
in with my mail days (we shall learn to do that soon), you would have
to send them only twice a week. That means less trouble in sending
them and much less expense than would be involved in sending them
daily, which would be no less than the cost of the newspaper itself,
—Lenin

[5]
See Letter No. 22.—Ed.

[6]
I think it would be easy far Mitya to arrange this either through
some law student or by going straight to the professor of political
economy and saying that he wishes to work in that field and take books
from the central library. The only thing is that he will have to
postpone it now till autumn.—Lenin

During his stay in Shushenskoye Lenin went shooting with
O. A. Engberg and I. L. Prominsky, who were exiled in the same
village, and the local peasants I. S. Yermolayev and P. T.

These words of Lenin’s sister were apparently in answer to his
letter of April 17, 1897 (Letter No. 22).

was discussed at meetings of the Third. Division of the Free
Economic Society on March 1 and 2, 1897. Professor Chuprov read

   

the paper to the Society. Lenin needed the book and the
verbatim report of the Society’s meeting for his work on The
Development of Capitalism in Russia.

June 8, alten Styls (June 20)

The day before yesterday, Mother dearest, I received
a letter from you and Manyasha from Warsaw. It was only
from this letter that I learned that you had put an end
to all your doubts and had set out on your journey.
Excellent. I hope you will make good arrangements and
will have a nice rest this summer. I don’t know why you
are afraid you will soon feel
Heimweh.[1]

If your trip is
only for the summer? I doubt it. I shall continue writing
as frequently as before and the extra three or four days the
post takes, with Moscow at such a considerable distance
anyway, will not mean much.

You have, of course, received all my previous letters
from Shusha and now know that I am fixed up here quite
well. I have been here exactly a month today and still say
the same—I am very satisfied with my board and lodging
and have even forgotten about the
Mineralwasser[2]

you
mention and hope that I shall soon forget its name. I am
now expecting visitors here—one of the comrades wants
to come from Minusinsk and Gleb wants to come here for
the shooting. And so I shall not be bored. Yuly left on May
27 for Turukhansk from Yeniseisk. Anatoly stayed there;
the doctor who examined him on the instructions of the
Governor-General found him weak. He will probably be
sent to Minusinsk District now. Perhaps he will come here.

    

The
doctor[3]

was not sent to Yakutsk either. He is being
sent to Kirensk.

Thanks to Manyasha for the postscript.

Kisses for her and for you,


Yours,


V. U.

Anyuta,

I think I have already written to you about the journals
and newspapers. I am sorry I have not written to Mark.
That oversight will probably cause considerable delay.

Send me more “literary manifestations” of all kinds—
at least catalogues and prospectuses to begin with. The
best thing is to write everywhere for them so as to obtain
as many as possible. I should very much like to get the
classics of political economy and philosophy in the original.
It would be a good thing to find out the cheapest editions
(people
edition,[4]

etc.), and the prices. You probably will
not find very much except at second-hand booksellers’.
However, I shall wait until I hear how you have fixed
yourselves up and then there will be time enough to write.

Gleb sends you his special regards. They are all now
living in Tesinskoye, A.M. as well (she has given up her
job). They have had a lot of visitors recently, so they had
a merry time. They write that they are fixed up quite well.

I am still without newspapers. The May issue of Novoye
Slovo for some reason has not arrived, either. Send me
the newspaper you will be reading, or even the issues you
buy casually. I can at least have a look at them.

Good-bye for the time being. Write more often.

Yours,

V. U.

June 15,  1897

In the last post but one, Mark, I received your letter
of May 23. At last you, too, are getting down to the
business of “spoiling paper”—that’s fine. I hope that the
“terrible boredom” you complain of will make you write more
often—I should be very glad of it. Moreover we are in rather
the same position. We are both living in villages and quite
alone—true, I am a bit further away—and so we must make
an effort to correspond more often.

It was news to me that Kokushkino is up for sale, and
that Mitya has gone to Kazan to see about
it.[1] Has he
power of attorney to handle the estate? Write and tell me
how the matter is settled. On the one hand it seems to be
a good thing that it will be finished with once and for all,
but on the other hand the “finish” is a most unpleasant,
troublesome and, most likely, unprofitable one.

I have not only not received the box of books—I did not
even know that it had been sent. Who was it sent to and
when? To whom was the carrier’s receipt sent? Write to me
about all this. From Mother’s letter I know that they
intended sending it through a carrier’s office. That means
it will take a long time, probably two or three months. If
any new books were bought to be sent with the others, please
let me know (if you remember) what they were, because
I do not risk ordering any at the moment, thinking they are
already on the way.

I have begun receiving Russkiye Vedomosti and read it
with a voracity that can be explained only as a reaction
to the long absence of newspapers. Has anything else been

    

ordered? (Russkoye Bogatstvo, Vestnik Finansov—in
Rybkina’s[2] name; German publications). I receive the
newspapers on the thirteenth day after Wednesday and Saturday.
That means that the post from Moscow here leaves on those
days; bear that in mind in case you have to make any
calculations about sending things.

The day before yesterday I received the report of the
Society for the Organisation of Popular
Entertainments.[3]
Thanks.

I have not yet received a single letter from our people
abroad. On account of their travelling they probably had to
wait a long time between my letters and wrote to me less often.
I do not know how to write to them now. It would hardly
be convenient to write to Berne and I have no new address.
The last time I wrote to Mother was a week ago, the same
time as I sent you a postcard. Today I shall not write a
special letter to her, but please send this letter on to her so
that she will not worry and will have some news of me.

It would not be a bad thing if Mitya, on his return, were also
to take up paper-spoiling. I have not yet given an answer
to his “theoretical” letter; the fact of the matter was that
I was so absent-minded when I was in Moscow that I did
not remember anything of what he told me about the
question that interested him. I could not gain a completely
definite impression from his letter—first, because it was too
short and, secondly, because I have here no Russian
translation of the book he quotes and cannot get the necessary
information.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

P.S. I am thinking more keenly and more often over the
idea of arranging for parcels of books to be sent here from
some capital-city library; I am at times beginning to think
that without that arrangement I shall not be able to carry
on literary work here; an outside stimulus is very necessary
and I have absolutely nothing of the sort here.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Dmitry Ulyanov went to Kazan in connection with the sale of
Kokushkino after the death of L. A. Ponomaryova. The very
unpleasant ending of which Lenin writes was that both shares,
that of Ponomaryova and of Lenin’s mother, might be left to
the latter with all their debts.





[2]
Rybkina—Nadezhda Krupskaya’s Party nickname.

Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya (1869–1939)—professional
revolutionary, prominent figure in the Communist Party and
the Soviet state; the wife of Lenin.

She began her revolutionary activity in 1890 in student
Marxist groups in St. Petersburg. From 1891 to 1896 she was a teacher
at the Sunday Evening School outside the Neva Tollgate and
conducted Social-Democratic propaganda among factory workers
She met Lenin when they were working together in the winter
of 1894. In 1895 she was one of the organisers of the St. Petersburg
League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class.
In August 1896 she was arrested and sentenced to exile for three
years; she started her term of exile with Lenin in Shushenskoye
and finished it alone in Ufa. After her return from exile in 1901
she went abroad and worked as secretary of the newspaper Iskra.
She played an active part in preparing the Second Congress of
theR.S.D.L.P., which she attended as a delegate with voice but
no vote. After the Congress she was secretary of the editorial
board of the Bolshevik newspapers Vperyod and Proletary. She
played an active part in preparing for the Third Congress of the
Party. While working abroad she maintained an extensive
correspondence with Party organisations in Russia. During the years
of reaction she took part in the struggle against the liquidators
and the otzovists. In 1911 she worked in the Party school at
Longjumeau; after the Prague Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (1912)
she helped Lenin establish contact with Party organisations in
Russia, with Pravda and with the Bolshevik group in the Fourth
Duma. In 1915 she was a delegate to the International Women’s
Conference in Berne.

Nadezhda Krupskaya returned to Russia with Lenin after
the February Revolution of 1917 and worked in the Secretariat
of the Central Committee of the Party; she took an active part in
preparing and carrying out the October Socialist Revolution.
After the revolution she became a member of the Collegium of
the People’s Commissariat of Education and in 1921 became head
of the Chief Committee for Political Education; in 1929 she was
appointed Deputy People’s Commissar for Education. Nadezhda
Krupskaya was one of the founders of the Soviet system of
education and a leading theoretician in the field of pedagogy. She
wrote a number of books on problems of public education and
communist upbringing, and on the women’s and youth movements.

   

She also wrote her reminiscences of Lenin. She participated in
all Party Congresses (except the 1st and 5th), became a member
of the Central Control Commission in 1924 and a member of the
Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) in 1927. She was a member
of all convocations of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
and of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R. and
was a deputy to the First Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and a
member of its Presidium.





[3]
The Neva Society {or the Organisation of Popular Entertainments,
the report of whose committee is mentioned here, was founded in
St. Petersburg in 1885; at first it was a private circle and later,
in 1891, was formed into an independent society with a set of rules
and an official name. The society had its own theatres, concert
halls and sports premises in the area beyond the Neva Tollgate,
where most factories were concentrated. The society arranged
carnivals, lectures, concerts, plays, dances, etc.; it also
organised workers’ choirs, reading-rooms and kindergartens. One of the
Society’s reading-rooms was used by members of Marxist study
circles for meetings and talks with workers. Before her arrest in
1896,  Nadezhda Krupskaya and other Marxist women teachers
made extensive use of the reading-room.

July 19,  1897

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter and
Manyasha’s dated the 29th. Merci for them.

Because of the exceptionally long time our letters take,
answers to questions arrive so long after they are asked
that many of them turn out to be unnecessary. In this
letter, for instance, you are still worrying about money and
the bale of books—it is now, of course, a long time since
you received my letter explaining all that; I received the
money a long time ago, I did not draw it for some time
because I did not need it and because nobody came from A.M.
I still have not received the bale of books; I do not know
if it has arrived in Krasnoyarsk (it was expected there at
the end of June), and from there it will be brought by
someone coming here whom I expect shortly. To send it from
Krasnoyarsk by post would probably cost quite a lot because
the post is not sent by steamer but by rail to Achinsk and
from there by road to Minusinsk.

Similarly you also must know by now not only that Mark
has received an offer to go to St. Petersburg, but also what
decision he has made; he wrote me that he was awaiting an
answer from you from abroad.

I received your letter with details of the Kokushkino
business and have already answered it. Yesterday, too, I
received the first letter from Mitya in which he, too,
described his trip to Kazan.

As far as hygiene is concerned, I do not think I am any
worse off here than you are in
Spiez.[5] I also bathe

    

(sometimes twice a day) in the Yenisei, take
walks[1]

and go
shooting. It is true that there are no decent walks near here, but
for shooting we sometimes wander a long way, and there
are some nice places.

Yesterday I received news from Tesinskoye about a
wedding—Basil and A.M. I am invited to be best
man.[6] It
will not take place very soon, of course.

I am very sorry about Pyotr
Kuzmich![2]

Your letter
was the only news I had heard of him.

Kisses—and  please do not worry about me.

Yours,

V. U.

I have received a letter from the doctor from Verkholensk
(Irkutsk Gubernia), where he has been sent. N. Y.
Fedoseyev has also been sent there.

Manyasha,

You ask me to describe the village of Shu-shu-shu.... Hm!
Hm! I think I did describe it to you once. It is a big
village with several streets, rather muddy, dusty—everything
as it should be. It stands in the steppes—there are no
orchards or greenery of any kind. The village is surrounded
by dung, which the people here do not cart to the fields
but dump outside the village, so that if you leave the
village you always have to pass through a certain amount
of dung. There is a stream called the Shush right beside
the village; now it is very shallow. At about a verst or a
verst and a half from the village (or rather from me—the
village is a long one) the Shush joins the Yenisei which breaks
up here into a large number of streams with islands between
them so that there is no way of reaching the mainstream on
foot. I bathe in the biggest stream, which is now also very
shallow. On the other side (the opposite direction from
the River Shush) there is, at a distance of about a verst
and a half, what the peasants quite seriously call “the pine
grove”; it is really a very poor bit of woodland, in which

    

most of the trees have been felled so that there is no real
shade (but a lot of strawberries!); it bears no resemblance
to real Siberian taiga which I have as yet only heard
about but have never been in (it is at least some thirty
or forty versts from here). Mountains ... when I wrote about
those mountains I was very inaccurate, for they are about
50 versts from here so that you can only look at them, when
they are not hidden by clouds, in exactly the same way
as you can see Mont Blanc from Geneva. Because of this
the first (and last) line of my poem contains a sort of poetic
hyperbole (the figure is used by poets!), about “Sayan’s
foot”.[3]

I can give only one answer, therefore, to your
question about which mountains I have climbed—-the sandhills
in the “pine grove”, so called—and in general there is
plenty of sand about here.

My work is progressing very, very
slowly.[4]

I do not know
whether I shall need any extracts from books. I hope that
by autumn I shall make an arrangement with some Moscow
or St. Petersburg library.

I read with pleasure your description of life abroad and
your impressions from there. I should be glad if you would
write to me more often.

Your plan to send “a pood of cherries” here, over a
distance of six thousand versts and a bit, made me open my
mouth in amazement (not from a desire to gorge myself on
cherries—there aren’t any here but there will be water
melons) at the richness of your imagination. What are our
chemists, compared with this!

Yours,

V. U.

August  17

The day before yesterday, Mother dearest, I received
your letter of July 29 (August 10) and also a letter from
Manyasha.

I am surprised that you are always saying that I do not
write often; for a long time, as far as I remember, I have
been writing every week and sometimes twice a week—
with every post, that is.

I am also beginning to wonder about the box of books;
since I received information from Krasnoyarsk at the end
of June that the books should arrive about that time and
that a further 9 rubles would have to be paid on them,
I have heard nothing more, although I immediately (July 1)
sent two letters to Krasnoyarsk about the books, one of them
with
money.[1]

An acquaintance who had promised to see
about my books has turned out to be irresponsible in the
extreme and does not even answer my
letters.[2]

I have
written a postcard with a pre-paid answer to Popova,
perhaps she will reply. It is a most annoying business! The worst
of it is that they do not even write, do not inform me of
the state of affairs! Has the carrier’s office been holding
it up? The scoundrels probably do not even guarantee to
deliver goods in time, nor accept responsibility for delays,
do they?

Anyuta also writes about the loss of your letters (by
the way, I have received Gumplowicz and Archiv from

    

her—my thanks for the two books). I do not know which
letters have been lost, I always acknowledge those I receive.
One letter was lying about for some two months in Minusinsk,
as I wrote before. I then wrote a complaint to the Minusinsk
post office and enclosed the envelope of that letter as
documentary
evidence.[3]

If registered letters or packages
by book post are lost, you must keep the receipts and
absolutely must demand compensation; that is the only
way to teach these Siberian Ivan
Andreiches[4] to be
careful.

There is nothing I can write about myself. The letters
are short because life is very monotonous; I have already
described the appearance Of things from the outside;
inwardly day differs from day only because today you are reading
one book, tomorrow you will read another; today you take
a walk to the right of the village, tomorrow to the left;
today you write one article, tomorrow another (I have now
been distracted from my main work by writing an
article[5]).
I am perfectly well, of course, go shooting now and again.
The weather is nasty—wind, cold, autumn rain, so I stay
at home most of the time. Probably there will be some fine
days in September. I intend going to Minusinsk to buy
myself a few things—a lamp, some things for the winter,
etc. I am thinking of going with Prominsky.

Thank Manyasha for her letter. She wrote asking me what
I should like from abroad; Mitya, she says, wants a steel
watch.... Hm! Hm! I have a watch and it still keeps
time, but an alarm clock would be (or, rather, might
be) very useful because here I sleep far too much and
have probably not only made up for the sleep I lost in
the remand prison but have badly overdone it.... Only
how will you send it here?... Unless you wait till someone
comes....

It is quite clear that Anyuta, as long as she lives in the
country, cannot fulfil my requests for books. If she should
chance to be in Berlin or Leipzig on the way back, then
perhaps she will be able to. I have already written that the
writer has agreed to my request to send me books, and that

    

I have received several from him (and shall probably receive
more in future)-which means that I am well enough off
in this respect and as yet do not experience any shortage.

Kisses  for  you  and   my   sisters,
V. U.

Problems of ’Handicraft’ Industry”. Material from this article
was also used in The Development of Capitalism in Russia.

The article was intended for the journal Novoye Slovo but was
not published in that journal, which was suppressed in December
1897.  The article was first published in 1898 in a miscellany of
Lenin’s writings entitled Economic Studies and Essays (see
Collected Works, Vol. 2, pp. 355–458).

September 7

I am sending you a registered package, Mark, containing
my
article.[1]

Please send it on to the writer as quickly as
you can (it is already late) together with the enclosed letter
to
him.[3]

At last, on September 5, I received Novoye Slovo for
June. I am afraid another copy will come from you—what
should I do with it?

The next half of this letter is for Manyasha, from whom
I received a letter dated 18 (30) August postmarked
Lausanne. I hope our people are all home again by this time.

All the best,


V. U.

I read in Russkiye Vedomosti that the statisticians in
Tula have not been
confirmed.[4] Was the Chicagoan among
their number? Why did he not answer my second letter
sent through Manyasha from
Krasnoyarsk?[2]


What is the library situation like?

September   7,   1897

Manyasha,

On September 5 I received your letter of 18 (30). Thanks.
That was an excellent idea to take excursion tickets to see
all Switzerland.
 

I am very glad that you have begun to enjoy being
abroad. What are your plans for the winter? You are probably
busy now searching for an apartment. The problem of finding
accommodation in a big city is a difficult and tedious
business! You are probably running around searching, if Mark
and Mitya have not yet found anything for you.

Mother’s letter, in which she spoke about her petition,
I received and answered
immediately.[5] The efforts made by
Gleb and Basil to get transferred to Minusinsk have not
come to anything although they were very energetic about
it.[6] I am not trying to get a transfer and so far do not
intend to; I have no complaints to make about Shu-shu-shu
and I do not like that state of uncertainty when you start
making applications, get excited waiting for a reply, keep
getting ready to leave and so on.

Well, all the best. I have not written much because today
I am late with the despatch of my article and am in a great
hurry. Kiss Mother.

V. U.

On August 6, 1897, Lenin’s mother sent the Governor of

September 30

I am writing to you from Tesinskoye, Mother dearest,
as I promised. I arrived here yesterday evening. It took
us a long time to get here because there were three of us
(Basil, I and a boy I took with me) with our luggage on
a one-horse cart, and the horse a lazy one at that.

The Tes
people[1]

are well fixed up. They have an
excellent flat in a big two-storey house (in Shusha there are no
such houses), the best in the village. They have the entire
top floor, four good rooms with a kitchen and an entrance
hall. The rooms are big, light, and clean with high
ceilings and the furniture is good—in short, an excellent
apartment for six rubles a month. Gleb now has a job of some
sort. Thanks to this they have been able to manage and the
financial crisis is over—there was, however, a time when
things were tight. A. M. has taken a job as a nurse in the
village of Sagaiskoye, several dozen versts from here in the
same district. She will probably not keep the job for long
because her health will certainly not permit her to continue
such work and she is expected to return in a month. Gleb
does not look too well, he is always poorly and gets
irritable. Basil is flourishing. E.E. feels quite at home in the
family and is doing all the household chores; she had a hard
time in the summer and even now it is not easy for her, as
she has to do all the work herself. It is impossible to find
servants here. In summer you cannot get anyone, even

    

temporarily. At the moment there is a woman who comes in
and helps with the work.

We all went shooting together today. The weather is
excellent and we are enjoying ourselves. I have permission
for five days and will leave on Friday or Saturday—straight
back to Shusha, about 70 versts from here.

I received a letter from Mark quite a while ago (dated
September 12). I am awaiting news of how he finished up
his “liquidator’s trip” to Kazan. He wrote to me, among
other things, about a dog. In Shusha I have a mongrel pup
and hope to have it as a gun dog next year. It would cost a mint
of money to bring a dog here from Russia. He also asks
about my book—it is still frozen. When I get back to
Shusha I hope to get down to work more seriously and will then
write in greater detail. Kisses for you and Manyasha.

Your,

V. U.

Everybody here also says that I have put on a lot of
weight this summer, am sunburned and look like a real
Siberian. That is what shooting and village life do for you!
All the Petersburg ailments have been shaken off!

All the people in Tes send you, it goes without saying,
lots of greetings.

October 12, 1897

On the 7th, Mother dearest, I received a letter from you
and Mitya dated September 20. I was in a great hurry last
time and, as I remember, did not write much. Today I
must make up for it.

Thanks to Mitya for his letter. In answer to his
questions—I am receiving Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii for
1897 and have also received one issue for 1896 and will
send it when I have read it (for the time being I have given
it to the people at Tesinskoye).

I still go shooting. The shooting is not as successful as
it was (shooting hares, grouse and partridge is new to me
and I shall have to get used to it), but it is no less pleasant.
Whenever there is a fine autumn day (and this year there
have been many of them) I take my gun and wander off
across the fields and forest. Usually I go with Prominsky;
I take my landlord’s dog, which I have trained to follow
me, and which has some (although not much) skill as a gun
dog, I have acquired a dog for myself—I got a pup
from an acquaintance here and hope that I shall be
able to train it by next summer; I don’t know whether
it will turn out a good dog and whether it will have any
hunting sense. I don’t know how to spot that kind of thing,
and no very definite opinion of the qualities of my
Pegasus can be had from his pedigree. The quilted jackets we
all had bought for us in St. Petersburg are very convenient
for shooting and I can never praise mine enough. In general,
as far as my winter clothes and other things (which you
ask about) are concerned, I have ample. I have already

    

bought many winter things in Minusinsk and will buy some
more. In general, shopping in Minusinsk is difficult; there
is practically no choice, the shops are the village type of
general store (all sorts of odds and ends; goods are
delivered periodically and I got there at a time when the old
stock had run out and the new had not arrived) and it
is difficult for one accustomed to city shops to find anything
in them. Incidentally, it is high time I got rid of these
bigcity habits; they are of no use here and I must get used to
local ways. I seem to be fairly well acclimatised, but as
far as shopping is concerned I still think in the St.
Petersburg way—you have only to go into a shop and get what
you want....

I will tell you about my journey in greater detail. I was
in Minusinsk for two days only and all the time went in
running round the shops, in seeing about Basil’s case (we
wrote a complaint together about the magistrate’s sentence
and the magistrate himself admitted that it was too
severe.[3]
We’ll see what the higher court has to say) and in visiting
acquaintances. There are now many political exiles in
Minusinsk—A. V. Tyrkov (the March 1,1881 case), N. S.
Tyutchev and Y. K. Yakovlev (Narodnoye Pravo group),
S. I. Melnikov (Narodnaya Volya Party), Blazejewski
(Polish worker), S. G. Raichin (my closest acquaintance
and a man of the same views), F. Y. Kon (Polish
intellectual who has served a sentence of penal servitude), and
Stoyanovsky (arrested in connection with the Ginsburg case
and has served a sentence of penal servitude). I saw almost
all of them. I think I shall be able to go there again in
winter. Such temporary visits are probably better than living
in Minusinsk, which does not attract me. Its only
advantage is the post (this advantage is even greater in Achinsk,
so I would naturally “prefer” Achinsk). But this is only
by the way, for I have settled down completely in
Shushenskoye and have got used to the idea of wintering here
and am not applying for a transfer and advise you not to.

I went to Tesinskoye with Basil. We had a good time there
and I was very pleased to see the comrades and to have
company after my Shushenskoye solitude. That company,
however, seems to be worse off than I am. Not as far as
lodgings, etc., are concerned, in that respect they are better

    

off, but they are not adjusted. Gleb is often quite ill, is
often despondent; Basil, too, it seems, is not so
“flourishing” after all, though he is the most balanced of the Tes
crowd. E.E. does the housekeeping, enjoys life at
Tesinskoye, but is also often ill. Keeping house is not easy for
her since there are no servants; it is extremely difficult
to find a servant in the Siberian villages—in summer it is
absolutely impossible. You can live well if you are fixed
up as I am with full board and lodging, but keeping house
yourself is very difficult. The Tes people live much more
“sociably” (so to speak) than I do; they are acquainted
with the district nurse in Tesinskoye and not far from them
(about 15 versts) there are some former women students
whom they see quite
often.[4] I have not lost hope that their
despondency will pass. Gleb and Basil now have
jobs[5];
they could not live without work, for the allowance they
receive is only 24 rubles (the authorities won’t give Basil
an allowance for his wife because he got married while
in exile).

Again about the library. Which library did Mitya
get the Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii from? If he got them
from the Petrovskaya library, can he get their catalogue
(a new one)? I think they lend books for an indefinite
period.

Yours,

V. U.

I am perfectly well, of course; I am working, I feel fine.

The doctor (from the north) asks me to give you his 

regards.[1]

-3
regularly.)[2]

October 19, 1897

I received Manyasha’s letter of September 29th, Mother
dearest, on October 14; it told me about the delay of my
letters to
Mark.[1]

I must admit I was afraid of this before,
when I knew that Mark was leaving. The delay, however,
was not very great, so small, in fact, that the manuscript
I sent reached its destination in
time.[3]

I am still living as usual, in peace and quietness. The
weather is getting wintry, we, have long since sealed
ourselves up behind double windows, keep the stove going,
etc. The real cold is still to come, of course, and so far there
have been mostly autumn days when it is pleasant to stroll
through the forest with a gun. I shall probably continue
that exercise through the winter. Shooting in winter,
going after hares, for instance, is no less interesting than it
is in summer, and I regard it as one of the important
advantages of rural life.

I usually get the magazines in the first half of the month.
I am now reading the September issues with interest. Soon
I hope to get some information from the editors about the
article I sent. If it is accepted I shall subscribe to a few more
magazines—I think I had better do it through the same
editorial office, so that there is no more muddle and I don’t
get the same copies twice.

I am awaiting news of the arrival of Anyuta, Mark and
Mitya.

Yours,

V. U.

I had a letter recently from Yuly. He writes that he
had moved to a new flat, much better than the old one,

    

and is now fixed up so comfortably that he has been able
to work for the past month; he has written something and
sent it off. We shall see how he will stand the winter in
Turukhansk. Anatoly has found work,
temporarily.[4]
 


Manyasha,

Merci for the letter. Why do you keep saying that
I should write more frequently? Do you think I do not write
often as it is? You say yourself that you now receive two
of my letters at a time—what more do you want?

Up to now I have not received the
L. G.[2]

and Bulletin. I do
not know the reason for the delay. If you happen to be near
the shop in which you ordered them, look in and hurry
them up.

Buy me Programmy domashnego chteniya na 3-i god
sistematicheskogo kursa; it costs 50 kopeks at the warehouse
in Nikitskaya Street, Rikhter House, apartment 3. (I read
about this book today in Russkiye Vedomosti and want
to see what it is like. It is probably to be found in other
bookshops besides that warehouse.) And subscribe for me
to the new monthly publication Izvestiya knizhnykh
magazinov tovarishchestva M. O. Wolfe, 35 kopeks a year
(Kuznetsky Most, 12, Moscow). I want to see what sort of
publication it is. In general I have nothing that gives me
bibliographical information and which will tell me about new
books. If you are interested in this publication, subscribe
to it in your own name and send it on to me afterwards.
Its programme is so extensive and the price so low that
one cannot help thinking there may be some catch in it.
We’ll see.

I recall that either Anyuta or you wrote to me about
having sent the second issue of Mehring. I have not received
it. It is quite possible that the first got through by chance.

All the best,


V. U.

December 10, 1897

According to my estimate, Mother dearest, this letter
should arrive by Christmas. I have decided to send it off
by the first post and not wait until Sunday (I am used to
writing to you on Sundays). I have received a letter from
Gleb in which he says he has submitted an application for
permission to come to me for ten days during the holidays.
I hope he will get permission. It will give me great pleasure.
They have written from Tesinskoye that Zinaida Pavlovna
has been sentenced to three years’ exile in northern
gubernias, and that she is asking to be sent to Minusinsk
District.[1]

I believe Nadezhda
Konstantinovna[2]

intends to
do the same, although her sentence is not yet properly
known; it will probably be very much the same.

I kiss you warmly,


Yours,


V. U.

I hope that Mitya will be free by the time you receive
this letter. They are not likely to hold him
long.[5]
 


Anyuta,

I am now reading the French translation of Labriola’s
Essays on the Materialistic Conception of History. It is a
very sensible and interesting
book.[3]

The idea came to me

    

that you ought to translate it. (The original is in Italian
and Kamensky in Novoye Slovo says that the French
translation is not very good. You would, of course, have to get
the original.) The book is in three parts: (1) In Memory
of the Communist Manifesto, (2) Historical Materialism
(the biggest part) and (3) Appendix: The Manifesto of the
Communist Party (translated into French by Laura
Lafargue). It goes-without saying that only the second part is
suitable for translation, and not all of that (I have not yet
finished reading it). If something is left out, it will not by
any means detract from this extremely clever defence of
“our doctrine” (Labriola’s expression). I am writing to
St. Petersburg this very day to find out whether the writer
proposes using this material for the journal. You can either
get his opinion from N. K. (I am writing to her) or propose
directly to him that you start the
translation.[6]

V. U.

Manyasha,

I received your letter of November 24 and the second
issue of the Vyatka Returns. Earlier I received the
Ulozheniye and
Ustav[7]—I do not remember whether I
acknowledged them.

You say that “goods for Minusinsk are still not being
accepted from Moscow”. Perhaps they will soon be
accepted. Mark could probably find out. Books are no longer
urgent. Perhaps you can send them with someone coming
at Christmas or with the
girls[4]

who intend to come here
(I am writing to Mother about them) or, eventually, with
someone else. If things are sent to Krasnoyarsk the delay
is, in any case, tremendous. If any book is needed for work,
I shall write and it can be sent by post. We had better wait
a while before using the carrier’s office.

Savchenko’s book, it seems, is Peskovsky’s.

Programma domashnego chteniya has arrived; I have
looked at it, it is dull and I do not want to write a review.
 

Wolfe’s little publication starts quite well and is
fabulously cheap.

I have ordered Seignobos. I do not intend to order Ziber
yet. If I get some money I shall probably order it, too.
Kalmykova’s bookshop gives me a discount of 15 per cent,
so I order books from there; it is convenient, too, because
it saves you trouble.

All the best,


V. U.

Lenin’s letters to Struve and Krupskaya proposing the

Materialism.

these books for his work as a consulting lawyer in Shushenskoye.
He later recalled, “...when I was in exile in Siberia I had
occasion to act in the capacity of a lawyer. I was not a certified
lawyer, because, being summarily exiled, I was not allowed to
practise; but as there was no other lawyer in the region, people
came and confided their troubles to me.” (Collected Works, Vol.
33, p. 295.)

December 21, 1897

I received your letter of December 5 the day before
yesterday, Mother dearest. I am very, very glad that there
is a hope of Mitya’s business being cleared up. In any case it
is obvious that it is mainly a misunderstanding and that
there can be no question of anything serious. You ask me
whether I received a package sent on November 16—what
package do you mean? If, in general, it is possible to send
things to Minusinsk you should address them to me direct,
because my letters go through Minusinsk Post Office
anyway and I have given our postman power of attorney to
collect my mail.

I seem to have got mixed up over all these packages you
have sent or intended to send me. Have you sent anything
to Popova in Krasnoyarsk? I think not, but just in case
I will ask an acquaintance who is going there soon (from
Minusinsk) to make
enquiries.[1]


I am in no hurry for books. I now have so many that I
cannot manage them all, let alone more.

Yours,

V. U.
 


Manyasha,

I received your postcard of December 2 and the two
Semyonov volumes. Merci for them. I shall send them back

    

soon, not later than a week from now (I am afraid our
postman will not go for the mail at all on Wednesday 24th).

These first two volumes proved to be without interest.
Such things are, of course, inevitable when you order books
you know nothing about, and I was prepared for it
beforehand.

I hope at least that we shall not have to pay any fine—
they will extend them for another month.

I did not understand your sentence “To get into the
jurists’ library—I asked Kablukov about it—you must be
a,jurist and submit two recommendations from members
of the Society of Jurists”. Is that all? You do not have to be a
member of the society yourself? I shall try to get a
recommendation through St. Petersburg.

I know for a fact that one does not have to be a jurist
to join the society.

All the best,


V. U.
 


Anyuta,

Merci for your letter of December 5 and for the list. It
is a pity you took so much trouble copying it a second time.
I seem to have expressed myself badly about the accounts;
it stands to reason that it is of interest to me to know
results—plus or minus so much—and not those details that
caused you so much trouble and nevertheless mean
nothing to
me.[2]


It is strange that they do not send me any accounts from
the office of the journal. I am shortly sending something
else[4] there. I shall have to put a note in with it (when I
send the manuscript) asking them to send an account of the
fees and expenditure on the journals, etc. It seems that I
have overstepped the mark through not knowing exactly
how much I own.

It seems that there was some misunderstanding between
us about my question concerning how the project for the

    

journal got into the hands of our
acquaintance;[5] I
understood that it came from you, and now I see quite well that
it did not. It stands to reason that what I said about my
first assumption does not hold now that the opposite has
been proved. Oh, that Yegor! I’ll give him what for.

The photos, including the group, have still not
arrived.[6]
I have written to Nadezhda Konstantinovna but have
not received a reply. Should I write to Yuly’s sisters?

By the way, I received a letter from Yuly dated October
29 (sic!). He writes that he lives reasonably well, they
have all moved into one house (this is much more
convenient and cheaper and the meals are more easily arranged
at the expense of their one and only “lady”), they have
received their allowances so he is looking and feeling
better and is not a bit despondent. Our poet
friend[3]

should
be coming to me soon for the holidays, if he does not let
me down again. Anatoly is still worried about his wife
who has been locked up in Yeniseisk (for three months),
the cells are cold and she has been taken
ill.[7] A bad
business! It would have been far better for her to have done
her term in Russia!

Fedoseyev and Lyakhovsky have not written a word.
The devil knows what’s happening where they are.

I should like to have Saint-Simon and also the following
books in French:

K. Marx. Misère de la philosophie. 1896. Paris. 3 frs 50 
 

Fr. Engels. La force et l’ économic dans le développement
social.  2 frs 50

K. Marx. Critique de la philosophie du droit de Hegel
.1895.  1 fr

all these are from the “bibliothèque socialiste
internationale” where Labriola came from.

All the best,


V. U.

 
Notes
 

[1]
It is not known who this acquaintance was.—Ed.

[2]
This apparently refers, to financial settlements for literary
work.—Ed.

[3]
G. M. Krzhizhanovsky.—Ed.
 



[4]
Lenin apparently refers to his essay “Gems of Narodnik
Projectmongering”, which he wrote for Novoye Slovo; he did not at the
time know that the journal had been suppressed   by the
government in December 1897.

In 1898 the essay was included in the miscellany Economic
Studies and Essays (Collected Works, Vol.  2,  pp.  459–89).





[5]
It has not been established what journal is meant. It is possible
that as early as 1897 the issue of another periodical was planned
in view of the constant persecution of Novoye Slovo by the
authorities and of its shaky position. After the suppression of Novoye
Slovo its place was taken by Nachalo (The Beginning), which
appeared in the first half of 1899 edited by P. B. Struve, M. I.
Tugan-Baranovsky and others.





[6]

“Lenin wrote about these photographs to his sister Anna in a letter
dated May 25, 1897 (see Letter No. 25). He expected, moreover,
to be sent a group photograph of the leaders of the St. Petersburg
League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class
(V. I. Lenin, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, V. V. Starkov, A. A.
Vaneyev, P. K. Zaporozhets, Y. O. Zederbaum, A. L. Malchenko),
which was taken in 1897 in St. Petersburg before they left for
Siberia.





[7]
This refers to D. V. Trukhovskaya, the wife of A. A. Vaneyev,
who was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in St.
Petersburg; she followed her husband into exile and did her three months
in Yeniseisk prison.

December 27, 1897

The money has arrived, Mother dearest, both the first
and the second lots (i.e., of November 16 and December 8).
We are now receiving our allowance regularly, too, so that
in this respect things have returned to normal and I think
for a long (relatively long) time no emergency additions
will be necessary.

Gleb has now been living with me for several days, having
obtained permission for a ten-day trip here. We are having
an excellent time and do a lot of walking because the
weather is mostly very warm. Ever since one day, when the
frost was said to be 36° R (about ten days ago) and after
a few days of snowstorm (“of weather”, as the people here
say), the days have been very warm and we go shooting
very zealously but without much luck. What shooting is
there to be had here in winter! The walks are pleasant,
though. Because of the holidays there was no outgoing mail
on Wednesday this week and ho incoming mail on Friday;
this is the third time since I have been living in Shusha that
the mail has missed a turn—that is not very often. Thanks
to my guest, I scarcely notice it.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

I am sending an article of mine for the journal. It would
be good if you could pass it on quickly; perhaps you will
be in time for the January
issue.[1]

Gleb sends his regards. He asks you to tell Manyasha
that he expects he will have a lot to argue about with her.
 

Manyasha,

Do not work so hard, Manyasha, over Stange; it is quite
probable that I was mistaken. How could I remember after
so many years! You have found one article so we may
consider ourselves lucky. It has even occurred to me that the
second was not in Ekonomichesky Zhurnal but in Severny
Vestnik for 1891 (at least I recently came across a reference
to that effect somewhere). In any case there is no need to
go through Ekonomichesky Zhurnal up to 1895.

As far as concerns your visit to me—I shall be very glad.
Things are different now and I have no particular reasons
for objecting. If you wait for a steamer up the Yenisei you
can travel without any particular discomfort. It is quite
possible that Nadezhda Konstantinovna will also come to
me; the matter will probably be settled soon, and may even
have been settled by the time you are reading this letter.
If she is allowed to choose Shu-shu-shu as her place of exile
instead of the north of Russia, she will not, of course, be
allowed to put it off until spring but will have to travel
at once.

Best wishes,


V. U.

I recall that Mark once wrote to me asking if he should
get a gun dog for me in Moscow. My attitude at the time
was very cool since I counted on my Pegasus, but he has
let me down badly. I would now be in hearty agreement
with such a plan, of course, but as far as I can see, it is
purely Utopian and would not be worth the trouble. The
transport is very expensive. Gleb gets fantastic ideas—why
not take a little pup and bring it in a basket! We had a
good laugh over that plan, which is, of course, little better
than any other. It was simply that Mark let his imagination
run away with him; from this postscript you can see what
petty problems sometimes engage the attention of the
inhabitants of Shu-shu-shu and Te-te-tes.

January 4, 1898

I have received, Mother dearest, your letter of December
15. One mail delivery was missed this week (January 1),
so I do not know the outcome of Anyuta’s
efforts.[4] It is
probable, however, that the outcome is favourable because
if the case has already gone to St. Petersburg it means that
it is a petty one and there is no reason for any great
delay.[1]


You need have no fears about my big coat. With my
winter suit (which we all brought with us from St.
Petersburg) it is quite enough even for travelling (and I very rarely
have to travel). For walking it is too warm and I wear a
quilted jacket—there have been a couple of cold days
(yesterday and the day before) but they are the exception.
Altogether, the winter here is exceptionally warm. Nor is
there any need to be afraid of my going shooting; there is
no danger. Now, by the way, there will be an end to all
shooting, probably until spring.... (The money has arrived,
the first and the second lots, both for the same sum.)

It is 55 versts from Shusha to Minusinsk, in winter there
is a shorter road—50 versts.

Gleb left here the day before yesterday, after a stay of
ten days. There was a real holiday this year in Shu-shu-shu
and the ten days passed unnoticed. Gleb liked the place
and said that it is much better than Tesinskoye (I said the
same thing about Tes! I made fun of Gleb by saying that
anywhere is better than where we are), that there is forest
near here (in which it is good to walk in winter) and an
excellent view of the distant Sayan Mountains. He was

    

enthusiastic about the Sayans, especially on a clear day when
the sun is on them. Gleb, by the way, has become very fond
of singing, so my silent rooms grew merry during his stay
and fell quiet again after he left. But he has no music and
no songs. I think we had a lot of that rubbish (from the
times when we also used to “bawl”). If nobody needs them
any longer it would be a good idea to send them to him;
he would be very glad. Basil is the musician (on the guitar)
and would rearrange them for him. Gleb’s health improved
somewhat during his stay with me due to the regular life
and plenty of walking; he was much livelier when he left.

I think I have already written that Nadezhda
Konstantinovna intended asking to be sent here (she was sentenced
to three years in the northern gubernias). If that plan is
carried out it will afford a good opportunity for books,
music and everything.

Kisses,

Yours,


V.U.

January 4, 1898 
 

Mark,

I have received your letter of December 16 in which two
interesting announcements with theses were enclosed. I must
admit that the prohibition of the lectures by
Tugan-Baranovsky and Struve did not very greatly surprise me since
the letter’s article on the same subject was cut out and the
theses were perfectly clear. I did not understand, however,
which minister banned the lectures. But, of course, it does
not take the St. Petersburg government departments long
to get in touch with each
other[5]....

I was very surprised to learn that the Chicagoan is in
St. Petersburg. The last time I heard of him it was said
(or rather, written) that he was somewhere in the
Caucasus. So he has a job now. He does not answer my letter
and I suppose I shall have to stop expecting him to; he is
probably very busy now at his job, and with his perpetual
journeyings could have forgotten it a dozen times over.
I’ll manage without him. How did you find him? How

    

is he looking (not in the physical sense) and what does
lie plan to do? What contacts has he made and is he
thinking of resuming his attempts at literary work? (Perhaps
Anyuta will write and give me answers to some of these
questions, as many [answers, that is] as she can, so I am
probably wasting your time asking you.) By the way, have
you written to him about my last request (I wrote to
Manyasha about it)—to inform H. Braun about permission
for a
translation?[2]


The lecture (Lozinsky’s) is really a masterpiece of
foolishness.[6] If P.B. does not write about it in the home
news,[7]
send me the issue of Trudy Volno-ekonomicheskogo
obshchestva containing it—if it is easy to find. He should be
put in his place beside Mr. Yuzhakov. [If you send the
lecture buy me at the same time the verbatim report of the
discussion in the Free Economic Society, 1896, on the
currency reform. Some Narodnik, it might even have been
Lozinsky, also distinguished himself on that occasion. ]

What have you heard about Syn
Otechestva?[8] I wrote
to St. Petersburg that they should subscribe to it for me if
it is worth the
trouble.[3]

It is interesting because of the
Narodniks on its staff. Do you ever see that sheet?

All the best,


V. U.

P.S. I have a gun dog again, a setter. A friend brought
it from town. We’ll see how it turns out, whether it will
live till spring (it is still very young and I am again afraid
it will get distemper). It has one disadvantage—it is of
the female estate....

1897 in the Third Division (Agricultural Statistics and Political
Economy)  of the  Free Economic Society.  The announcements

January 24, 1898

I have received letters from Manyasha and Anyuta and
also two books—Semyonov (Vol. III) and Yuridichesky
Vestnik. Many thanks to Manyasha for the latter. I have also
received Basil’s photograph.

Please buy me the books—Kablukov, Lektsii po ekonomii
selskogo khozyaistva, and V.V., Ocherki kustarnoi promysh-
lennosti (1 ruble 50). The latter may perhaps be found
second-hand; the former was recently issued for students
and Manyasha can probably get it for me even if it is not
on sale (as is possible, judging from the absence of
advertisements in Russkiye Vedomosti).

I have nothing new to say about myself. It is pleasanter
now three of us go shooting together—we are having real
spring weather; it is even thawing today.

Nadezhda Konstantinovna has been given reason to hope
that her three years’ exile in Ufa Gubernia will be changed
to two years in
Shusha[7] and I am expecting her and
Yelizaveta
Vasilyevna.[8] I am even getting lodgings ready—
the next room in the same
house.[1]

If other guests come in
summer we can take the whole house (the owners will move
into the old log cabin in the yard), which would be much
more convenient than our setting up house here ourselves.
 

What I do not know is whether N. K.’s case will be
settled by spring; it is said that we shall get an answer
in February, but so far that is only a rumour.

It is most annoying that Mitya’s case is dragging on so
long; it will be unpleasant for him if he has to lose a year.
Still, he will probably be allowed to enter another
university or to take his examinations as an external
student.[2]


Yours,

V. U.

I am enclosing a letter to
Columbus.[3]
 


Anyuta,

I have read in the newspapers about the publication of
your translation of de Amicis’s book. If you have any spare
copies please send me some. On what terms did you do the
translation? Was there a contract with the publisher, and
what sort?

My head is now full of plans to issue my articles as a
separate
book.[9] A few days ago I received N. Vodovozov’s
Ekonomicheskiye etyudy, and that gave me the idea. It would
be very inconvenient to publish the article about the
handicraftsmen as a separate pamphlet. It would be far better
to print it together with the Sismondi article. It could
then be published without preliminary censorship (10
printer’s signatures are needed for that and these articles
will make about 12—about 200 pages, that is), which is
much more convenient. It could be given the title of An
Assessment of the Romantic Doctrines of Narodism. Such
a book would be more interesting and varied. The main
question, in my opinion, is whether the censors will permit
the reprinting of an article from a suppressed journal. I
should imagine they will permit it, as it is an abstract
article and was published a long time ago, long before the
journal was suppressed. I am also writing to N. K. about
this—she should ask the writer’s opinion. I do not want
to wait until their new plans are put into effect. The
articles are actually not very suitable for a journal, as they

    

are too long. Let the other articles that I think it would be
dangerous to include in the book (they would not be allowed)
and not very suitable (they are of a different character)
go for the journal. The article about handicraftsmen is
quite mild and full of figures. As far as the financial side of
the business is concerned I think it is much more favourable
than the censorship side of it. Assuming that the price is
a ruble fifty kopeks and only a thousand
printed[4]

we can
allow 500 rubles for the publication and the same sum each
for the booksellers and the author. The sale of 500 copies
would cover costs, and that number is certain to be sold.

The question is who will undertake the publication. There
is no one to be relied on in St. Petersburg. Would not Mark
undertake the publishing job (buying paper, contract with
the printer) and Manyasha the
proof-reading?[5]

If that plan
can be put into effect I will immediately send corrections
to the article on Sismondi (it must be broken up into §§
and some important misprints need correcting). If you agree,
telegraph me “send corrections”. I calculate that the book
could come out in April, if not sooner.

It seems to me we should try ourselves and not wait for
the plans of the Novoye Slovo people, who move at a snail’s
pace. And, besides, it is a pity for me to write for nothing—
I must earn something, too. The objection may be raised
that the articles are quite different in character, but I do
not think there is anything wrong in that; Vodovozov’s
are also different in character, and, in general, such
collections of articles are published. There is, moreover, something
common to them both; they are a criticism of Narodnik
economics—one is abstract and the other uses Russian data.
Please answer me as quickly as possible about this—can
the plan be carried out or not? If it can, we must start on
it without losing time.

N.Y.F. does not write to me and does not even answer,
although I have written him two
letters.[6]

Scold him for

    

that if you write. I have heard of the “scandal” in
Verkholensk—some disgusting scandal-monger has been attacking
N.Y.[10] No, don’t wish me comrades from among the
intellectuals in Shushenskoye—I’d rather not! When N.K.
arrives there will be a whole colony anyway.

Regards to all,


Yours,


V. U.

Notes
 

[1]
An amusing competition is going on between us and the local
parson, who is also asking our landlady for a room. I am protesting
and insist that she wait until my “family” affairs have been finally
settled. I still do not know whether I shall be able to get rid of my
rival.—Lenin

[2]
See Letter No. 34.—Ed. 
 —Lenin

[3]
The letter has been lost—Ed.

[4]
If 2,000 copies are printed the price may be reduced to 1r.  25k. 
 —Lenin

[5]
The proofs will not be very difficult since half the book is a
reprint and the other half from a manuscript I have rewritten in a
fair copy.—Lenin

[6]
The correspondence between Lenin and Fedoseyev has been
lost—Ed.
 



[7]
On January 8, 1898, Lenin sent a telegram to the Director of the
Police Department asking for permission for his fiancee, Nadezhda
Krupskaya, to spend her period of exile in the village of
Shushenskoye. Krupskaya sent a request to the Minister of the Interior
to be allowed to spend her term of exile in Shushenskoye with her
betrothed and to have her sentence reduced from three to two
years. She was given permission to spend her period of exile in
Shushenskoye instead of Ufa Gubernia where she had formerly
been ordered to go, but the sentence was not reduced.





[8]
Krupskaya,   Yelizaveta Vasilyevna (1842–1915)—mother of
Nadezhda Krupskaya, who lived with her daughter and Lenin in
exile and abroad; she helped them in their revolutionary work;
she was   given various JOBS to do—looking after illegal litera-

   

ture, taking  things to prisons   for arrested comrades, etc. She
always took good care of Lenin, who had great respect for her.





[9]
The plan was put into effect; in the autumn of 1898 the first
collection of Lenin’s articles under the general title of Economic
Studies and Essays by Vladimir Ilyin was published in St.
Petersburg. It contained the essays  “A Characterisation of Economic
Romanticism”,   “Gems  of   Narodnik Project-mongering”,   “The
Heritage We Renounce”, etc.





[10]
This refers to  Yukhotsky, who began a campaign of slander
against N. Y. Fedoseyev while in the Moscow transit prison; he
accused him of embezzling money collected for the needs of exiles.
Although such accusations were  obviously false, Yukhotsky did
not cease his persecution of Fedoseyev even in exile at
Verkholensk where they were sent at the same time. Yukhotsky’s
persecution was one of the causes of    Fedoseyev’s tragic death.

February 7, 1898

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received letters from you
and from all the family dated January 22 and 23 and was
very glad to get them; I send you my thanks for all the
good wishes, I guessed, of course, that you would write
to Nadezhda Konstantinovna and invite her to visit you;
it is to be hoped she will be allowed to. I still know nothing
about her transfer to Shu-shu; she keeps writing that it
will be settled “in a day or two”, but it is still dragging
on. Now, however, we probably shall not have to wait
long for a final decision.

As to what you should send with N.K.—I think you should
give her a real load of books since we do not know whether
there will be an opportunity in summer. Manyasha intends
going abroad (and that, of course, is a bit more interesting
than Shu-shu and the Siberian mosquitoes), and you will
probably go off to Kokushkino with Mitya.... It’s bad that in
two and a half months he has already begun to look puffy.
First—does he stick to a diet in prison? I suppose not. In
my opinion that is essential. Second—does he do physical
jerks? Probably not, either. Also essential. I can at least
say from my own experience that every day, with great
pleasure and profit I did my gymnastics before going to bed. You
loosen up so well at times that it makes you warm even in the
worst cold, when the cell is like an ice-well, and after it
you sleep better, I can recommend to him an exercise that
is very convenient (even if funny)—bow to the ground
50 times. I set myself that stint and was not embarrassed
when the warder watched me through the peephole and was

    

amazed that a prisoner who had never expressed a desire
to attend the prison church should suddenly have become
so pious! He must bow not less than fifty times without
bending his legs and must touch the floor with his fingers
each time. Tell him that. Most of these doctors, you know,
only talk about hygiene.

I have already written something about clothes. I do
not need any underclothes except socks. As for the local
tailors, I do not place much hope in them. It is very
inconvenient to get clothes made in Minusinsk; one has to go
there. There is a tailor here who makes clothes for
everybody (he told me so today), including former political
exiles, even for all the priests (he boasted to me of that).
Although it all sounds very impressive, you had better buy
ready-made clothes in Moscow and give the material you
have to Mitya or Mark. One thing I do ask you for in
particular—a pair of moleskins, because I tear my clothes
terribly when I am out shooting. If my straw hat is still
in good shape (it’s a Paris hat, after all, the devil take it!)
she should bring it. Prominsky, as a matter of fact, has
begun making hats (sometimes they look like felt boots!)
but they are suitable only for spring and autumn and not
for summer. The only other thing is—kid gloves, if they
can be bought without knowing the size (which I doubt).
I have never worn them, either in St. Petersburg or Paris,
but I want to try them in Shu-shu-shu in summer as a
protection against mosquitoes. I can wear a net over my head
but my hands get badly bitten. Gleb assures me that the
local mosquitoes bite through gloves but I do not believe
him. The gloves have to be suitably chosen, of course, not for
dances but for mosquitoes. Then I need some paper, ruled
in squares; I do not suppose there is any in
Minusinsk—anyway I do not need much, about four quires with squares of
different sizes from the smallest to the largest.

Anyuta asks when the wedding is to be and who we are
“inviting”! Isn’t she in a hurry! First of all Nadezhda
Konstantinovna has to get here, and then we have to get
permission from the authorities to marry—we are people
without any rights at all. So how can I do any “inviting”?

As far as concerns verbalisme and phraséologie it seems
to me that they should be translated as verbalism (with an

    

explanation) and phraseology.... That, of course, is not
really translation but simply transcription, but what else
can you do? “Dilettantism” is quite wrong for verbalism—
almost the opposite, in fact. Verbalism is probably closer
to scholasticism, i.e., to superfluous (pseudo) learnedness,
than to dilettantism. But I don’t remember exactly how
Labriola uses these words.

Merci for Bogdanov. I have read half of it. Very
interesting and to the point. I am thinking of writing a
review.[2]

In reply to Manyasha’s questions: what sort of voice
has Gleb? Hm, hm! I suppose it must be baritone. He sings
the things that Mark and I used to “bawl”
(as Nanny[3]
used to say).

The next question—will Paris go to her head? Very like-
ly. She has now seen for herself what it is like abroad
and can, judge. I lived only one month in Paris, did very
little work and spent most of the time running round to
see the “sights”. It is not clear to me either whether
Manyasha wants to go to study or for the summer only.

Thanks to Mark for his letter. He must not, however,
forget Gogol’s
“Ivan Andreiches”.[4] I do not know what
progress has been made in Russia, but here in Siberia they
are doubtlessly flourishing, and they are interested in other
things besides knowing whether a government official is
arriving and whether the young ladies are on the way.

I am surprised that you have not even heard about Syn
Otechestva. I saw in
Russkaya Mysl[5] today (the issue of
November or December 1897) that the newspaper declares
itself a Narodnik organ pur
sang.[1]


Till next time.


Yours,


V. U.

The real cold has now arrived, so we have given up
shooting and only go for walks—in the forest, though. My
lodgings are warm, however, and my clothes still warmer.

Manyasha should send Nadezhda Konstantinovna the list
of books I should like to have—she will look for them in
St. Petersburg, if, of course, it is not too late by now.
 

If we have any other children’s picture books let N.K.
bring them for Prominsky’s children.

February 14, 1898

I have received a
book (Bulgakov[6]) from Manyasha,
Mother dearest, and thank her for it. She asks whether
I received a registered package sent by Anna on December
27.[1]

It is difficult for me to remember now because it was a
long time ago. I remember that I received some foreign
catalogues and
Neue Zeit.[7] Manyasha’s letter is dated
January 26, so it is quite possible that my answer to the
letter of December 27 had not reached Moscow by
then.[2]

I received Bogdanov’s book before that; I liked it very
much and have written a
review.[3]

Bulgakov’s book is
not too bad, either, but I do not like the chapter on turnover
and his formulation of the question of the foreign market
is not quite correct. I was, of course, very pleased to
receive it.

Again our allowance is being delayed—owing to the new
year. Another piece of news—a new chief of police has
arrived from Yeniseisk (it is the one who wanted to take
the shotguns
away).[8] He does not seem to have done
anything to distinguish himself yet. For some unknown reason
Prominsky has had his allowance reduced from 31 rubles
a month (he has five children) to 21 rubles—seven people
cannot live on that sum in Shusha and his hatter’s business
(that is his trade) is not a going concern here. Another

    

comrade[4]

went to see a doctor in Minusinsk and has been
admitted to hospital there.

It is still very, very cold here; the Siberian winter intends
to make itself felt after all. But I seem to have got fairly
used to the frosts, and do quite a lot of walking every day.

Yours,

V. U.

Did you send N.K. money to subscribe to Vestnik
Finansov? I did not expect it at all (because I asked her to
subscribe only in the event of my finances being in a brilliant
state) and now I get it from her as I always did.

Today I am sending Anyuta tho books from the library
and the technical reports by registered post.

 


Mark,

Nadezhda Konstantinovna writes that the writer has
proposed either to look for money for the publication of
my articles or a publisher for them, and for this reason
she will not take the manuscripts away from him. I answered
that she should take them and send them to you because one
can “look” for many years, and, indeed, who would willingly
go to so much trouble. I shall start on the corrections to
Sismondi in a couple of days without waiting for your answer
to one of my earlier letters and as soon as they are finished
I shall send them to
you.[9] (The writer’s proposal is
important to me only because it shows the feasibility of this
enterprise from the standpoint of censorship, which is actually
the only thing that interested me.) As regards my other
manuscripts, with the exception of the article on
handicraftsmen,[5]
[10]

I do not think they should be included, first,
because they are of a different character, suitable only for
a journal, the subjects are polemical and of temporary
interest, and, secondly, because it is not worth the risk.
 

When you receive this letter you should be able, I think,
to begin negotiations with the printers (in the plural,
because you will probably have to seek and haggle) and look
for a shop in which to buy paper. While these preliminary
searches are going on I shall send the corrections, and you
will then be able to go straight on with the printing. It
seems to me important not to waste time, so that the book
can come out in April.

All the best,


V. U.

I think the article on Sismondi had better go first, followed
by the handicrafts.

February 18, 1898

Today I am sending you, Mark, the corrections to the
Sismondi article by registered post. There were fewer
corrections than I expected—only the misprints and the
division, of the article into chapters (two) and paragraphs.
It is to be expected that the compositors will find it much
easier to work from a printed text, so there will be fewer
mistakes and less proof-reading to do (but the proofs
absolutely must be read). The magazine pages I am sending
can go straight to the printers, but give them strict
warning not to lose
them[1]

(they usually do lose manuscripts)
and that each time they should send the original
(manuscript or magazine page) together with the proofs; without
this it is terribly difficult for a stranger (not the author) to
correct them (I know this from my own experience) and
there will be many unpleasant misunderstandings and
mistakes. I hope Manyasha will find time to undertake the
proof-reading. In general, it is very important for the proofs
to be read by one person from beginning to end, otherwise
there will be a muddle because of the signs the proof-readers
use, and, furthermore, they usually forget, when
subsequent proofs are received (there must be at least two), to
verify whether the mistakes indicated in the first proofs
have been corrected and whether fresh mistakes were not
made in correcting the old ones. Accurate printing and an
elegant edition are very important.
 

The article (together with this letter) will arrive at the
very beginning of March and if you set about the printing
immediately and carry it out without delay, and if you
hurry the printer, you may manage to finish it and present
it to the censor by Easter. That would be very good; the
sale of the book will probably be much slower if it does
not come out until May. I am awaiting news from you on
the way things are going.

I have been thinking a lot about the other two articles
(on the “heritage” and on Yuzhakov); on the one hand,
caution tells me that they should not be printed, but, on
the other hand, it is a pity to abandon them, especially
the second.... The fact is that it analyses a book and not
a magazine article.... Perhaps we should try? If experienced
people had not decided that it was impossible I should not
have been averse to trying. We should have to cross out
a few places recalling the defunct
journal[2]

(I have no rough
copy of the Yuzhakov article, so the publisher will have to
do it. It is not a big job), and then place them at the end,
so that if they are removed (in case the authorities demand
it) it will not spoil the preceding articles. If you estimate
the cost of the publication at 40 rubles a printer’s
signature, the loss on those two articles (together four signatures)
would not be so great. In any case the book should not be
delayed on account of them.

If they have not yet sent you the manuscripts from St.
Petersburg, write an urgent letter to Nadezhda
Konstantinovna to send them immediately and start printing what I send
today.

All the best,


V. U.

Please hand or send the enclosed letter to N.K. She
asks me to write to Moscow now, since they will probably
be moving her soon.

February 24, 1898

Today, Mother dearest, I received a pile of letters from
all parts of Russia and Siberia and have therefore been
in a holiday mood all day.

From Manyasha and Anyuta I received their letters of
February 9 and also Yuridichesky
Vestnik[2] and
Statistichesky Vremennik and also the Dnevnik syezda (of
technicians).[3] Thank you for everything. The last-named was very
interesting and thank Anyuta very much for it. She writes
that the book by de Amicis is a children’s book. I did not
know that, but even children’s books will be useful here,
for Prominsky’s children have nothing to read. I even
thought of doing a thing like subscribing to
Niva.[4] That
would be very nice for the Prominsky kids (pictures every
week), and for me a complete edition of Turgenev in 12
volumes as promised by Niva. And all this for seven rubles,
including postage. Very tempting! If only Turgenev is
published decently (that is, without distortions, cuts, clumsy
misprints), it would be well worth while subscribing. Have
any of our people seen the Niva supplements for past years?
I think they issued Dostoyevsky? Was it decently done?

I now expect to set my money affairs right, since the book
edition of the articles should also bring in something
whatever happens, and, moreover, I am getting a big
translation from English (from St. Petersburg)—Adam Smith—and
I shall get something for
that.[5] I shall then be able to pay
off my debts (I must not forget them). That is why I think
it is also possible to subscribe to Niva. Whether Turgenev

    

will be “decently” published, our people must decide,
they have more facts to go on.

Today I received Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 1 for 1898.
I have been receiving Vestnik Finansov for a long time.

I shall have to ask you to send a smallish sum of money
by N.K. (there will be no need for it earlier. The allowances
were paid today), since there may be some fairly big
expenses to meet. That means that my debt will increase slightly.

Things here are still the same—no news, no visitors and
still no acquaintances.

Anyuta writes that N.K. has written to her saying that
a publisher has been found in St. Petersburg. She wrote to
me only that they had “promised to look for one”. We
may have an amusing muddle; the plan was evolved in St.
Petersburg independently and prior to my letter, and mine
was also independent, prior to the receipt of the St.
Petersburg letter. And so we are dancing round each other like
people who have bumped into one another in the street and
do not know whether to step left or right to allow their
vis-à-vis to pass.

The matter has probably settled itself by now.

Kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

I understood from Manyasha’s letter that both books
(Yuridichesky Vestnik, 1887, No. 12, and Statistichesky
Vremennik) had been bought and would not have to be
returned.

N.K.’s case is still dragging on. She will probably have
to drop the claim for a shorter term, but they do promise
to permit her to come here.

I am enclosing a letter to her because she may now be
in Moscow. If not, send it on.

 


Manyasha,

Send me, in addition, the following things:

(1) Hardmuth pencil No. 6 (Anyuta bought me one last
year and I liked it very much, but it has now,
unfortunately, served its time).
 

(2) A box of sealing wax and some sort of a seal to seal
my letters. (If we-have not got an old seal, either buy or
order a cheap one,) There is no need for a name on the seal,
even initials are not necessary, as long as there is some sort
of a figure or drawing on it that is easily remembered and
described to others.

(3)  essuie-plume[1]

}}     

(4)  small scissors  }}


I had both of these but, alas, they got lost somewhere on the
road. In place of the former I am now using the skirt of
my jacket and have inked it up beautifully. The scissors I
get from the landlord—sheep shears. Their advantage is
that they always arouse laughter and general amusement.

Au revoir,


V. U.

translation.

March 1, 1898 
 

I am still waiting for news, Mother dearest, of Mitya’s
release, but it is a long time coming. 
 

I am quite well and life goes on as usual. Even winter
at last seems to be coming to an end. We have got very
tired of it here. Today and yesterday there has been real
spring weather. 
 

I am enclosing a letter for N.K. in case she has not yet
left, and a business letter for Mark on the other side of the
paper.

Yours,

V. U.
 


Mark,

I have received some information that compels me to
change my original plan to publish the book in
Moscow.[1]

The writer informs me that censorship conditions in Moscow
are impossible. Bulgakov’s book (about markets) was held
up for a year by the censors! That is something quite
unbelievable! If that is the case we cannot even think of Moscow;
we must turn all our attention to St. Petersburg. The writer
has every chance of publishing it at the moment but he wants
to delay it till autumn (wrongly, in my opinion). As regards
financing the edition, I think we can raise “an internal

    

loan” from Mother, because the book will certainly pay for
itself.

This information has put me so much off my balance
that I have nothing to propose. You will probably be
seeing N.K.; talk to her about it and come to a decision. To
make a “decision” from here means writing, writing,
writing, and all for nothing, without knowing anything,
depending on guesswork, etc.

Yours,

V. U.

I hope you have not had any more unnecessary trouble
over this unfortunate business. (N.K. writes that she has
not sent the manuscripts.) Awaiting your answer.

March 8, 1898

This week, Mother dearest, I do not think I have had a
single letter from you. From this I gather that Mitya is
still inside, and that is very sad.

I do not know now whether this letter will find N.K.
in Moscow. In case she is still there I am adding one forgotten
request. Send me one of our sets of chessmen; it turns out
there are some players among our comrades in Minusinsk
and I have once already recalled old times most enjoyably.
I was wrong in thinking Eastern Siberia an outlandish
place where no chessmen would be needed. There are all
kinds of places in Eastern Siberia.

Life goes on as usual. From Tesinskoye they write that
E.E. has had her allowance stopped—“mothers are not
regarded as members of the family” (a new interpretation!).
They have also reduced Prominsky’s allowance from 31
rubles to 19 a month. Anatoly has at last “rescued” his
wife after a lot of trouble. Yuly writes from Turukhansk
that he is living tolerably well—not the kind of fellow to
lose heart, fortunately.

Yours,

V. U.

I am enclosing a letter for Nadezhda Konstantinovna.

Please send me as much money as possible with her;
if she has already left, send it to Yelizaveta Vasilyevna’s
address. There may be fairly heavy expenses, especially
if we have to set up house for ourselves, so I am going to
make my debt a good round sum and raise another internal
loan. By autumn I shall probably receive enough for my
translation to cover my debts—I believe more than five

hundreds.[1]

 

Anyuta,

I should like to ask you to get me some English
textbooks. I asked for something to translate and have received
the
Webbs’[2] big book. I am afraid I may make mistakes.

I need (1) an English grammar, especially syntax, and
especially a section on idioms. If N.K.has not got a Nurok
(I think she had one but I do not know if it was hers), send
me yours (or Manyasha’s) at least for the summer, unless
you (or Manyasha) need it. The only thing is that I do not
know whether Nurok will give enough on this question.
If you could get a good textbook of English it would be a
very good thing.

(2) A dictionary of geographical and proper names. They
are very difficult to translate and transcribe from English
and I am very much afraid of making mistakes. I do not
know whether suitable dictionaries exist. If there is no
information in The Book about Books or in some other
reference work or catalogue, perhaps there is some other source
from which you could find out.

If you have a chance to find out and to get something
(in this case I do not grudge money, for the fee will be a
large one and I must make a good job of the first attempt)—
but there is no need to take any particular trouble; I shall
get the German translation and will be able to refer to it.

Yours,

V.  U.

What do you think about summer? Will Mitya be allowed
to go to Kokushkino? Are you thinking of, staying there
or not?

Moscow is a rotten town, isn’t it? It is a rotten place to
live in and a rotten place to publish books in—so why stay
there? I really was surprised when Mark informed ,me that
you were against moving to St. Petersburg.

together on the translation of the first volume of the book.

March 14, 1898

I have received, Mother dearest, your letter of
February 28. I did not expect you to return from Kazan so soon,
A few days ago I got a letter from there from Alexander
Ivanovich which greatly surprised me. He says be is now
working, that Nikolai Ivanovich is in St. Petersburg; and
that they are living in the same place in
Kazan.[1] I must
make up my mind to answer it some time. I know nothing
about his health—it is difficult to draw any conclusion
from his letter; if he is the same as he used to be, it will be
difficult for him to go to work and it will not be easy for
him to make a living, either.

If books can be sent by express on the railway and the
charge is the same as for a slow train, it is, of course, better
to send them that way. The thing is when and to whom to
send them? It is risky to send them to Achinsk, for Nadezhda
Konstantinovna to take them on with her from there; they
may be delayed and get left in Achinsk. They will most
likely have to be sent to Krasnoyarsk again and wait for
someone coming from there. I shall probably be able to find
someone more easily now.

With regard to being transferred from here, I am not
so far thinking of it. In my opinion it would be premature.
I shall wait until Nadezhda Konstantinovna arrives and see
how things turn out. I am not writing to her today because I
hope that she will have left Moscow by the time this letter
arrives. If, despite my hopes, she is still there when it
comes, please tell her that yesterday I received the German

    

translation of Webb (it is a great help to me—I could not
have managed without it) and Vestnik Finansov.

There is no need to worry about my health—I am now
quite well.

We are now having fine weather, the sun is getting
appreciably warm and the roads are beginning to deteriorate.
Winter, however, retreats very reluctantly here and there
is still a long wait ahead for the warm weather.

You will probably receive this letter about April 1, or
only shortly before. I offer you and Manyasha my best
wishes on the occasion of your name day. I hope Mitya
will definitely be out by Easter.

Yours,

V. U.

From Manyasha I have received Moskovskiye Vedomosti
,[2] at first one issue (I forget which)—there were no interesting
articles in it. Yesterday I received four more issues (Nos.
53-56) in which I read some interesting little articles
badgering Marxists. Merci for them.

In the near future, in three or four weeks or perhaps
earlier, we must expect the spring breakdown of
communications with Russia; for a fortnight or perhaps as much as
three weeks, there will be no post to and from Russia.

March 28 
 

Mark,

I received your letter of March 10 acknowledging receipt
of my manuscripts and proposing various plans.

You have, of course, received my letter in which I reject
the idea of publishing in Moscow (I wrote that letter
immediately after I learned about censorship conditions in

Moscow)[1]

.



It stands to reason that if things are so impossibly bad
with the Moscow censor it is no use thinking of publishing
there. Why should we risk such a large sum of money when
there may be a delay of a year or a year and a half (at least
)? You must gather the manuscripts together, do them up in
one packet and send them back to St. Petersburg, to the
writer, since he is kind enough to take the trouble, upon
himself. Write to him about the money, telling him we have
it, and that he should inform you how much he needs; and
that he should see about the publication in autumn, without
losing time, as soon as his own work permits.

Such is the outcome of two months’ correspondence!
I hope you have not yet done anything definite. If you
have bought paper you can send it on to St. Petersburg,
and if you have started having it set you must pay for the
pages already set. It is better to lose a few dozen rubles
than risk hundreds. The writer (and you can believe him)
speaks confidently about St. Petersburg.
 

Of course, if I had had any idea of the charms of our
“first capital city” and its censors, I should never have
dreamed of publishing a book in Moscow. I found out too
late, from N.K.’s letter, after she had consulted the writer.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

My work has come to a complete
standstill[2]

;

I am busy
with the translation and spend a lot of time over it. After
that we’ll see—the rough translation will soon be ready,
but it will require radical revision.

 


P.S. I am surprised that you write as if you want to
publish the book in Moscow—and at the same time point
out how impossible censorship conditions are there. Why
kick against the pricks?

May 10, 1898

At last, Mother dearest, my visitors have
arrived.[2]
They got here on the evening of May 7, and on that very
day I was clever enough to go shooting, so they did not
find me at home. Nadezhda Konstantinovna, I find, is not
looking at all well—she will have to take more care of her
health while she is here. As for me—Yelizaveta Vasilyevna
exclaimed, “Oh, how fat you’re getting!”; and so, you
see, you could not wish for a better report!

The terribly sad thing is that they did not bring any
good news about Mitya!

I received your letter sent with them and that of April 20.
A big merci for the things you sent. N.K. has made
arrangements in Minusinsk about the books that are to come and
I hope I shall get them soon without any trouble. I may
fetch them myself as I intend going “to town”.

About steamers. They took N.K. only as far as Sorokino
(some 70 versts from Minusinsk) after they had waited a
week in Krasnoyarsk. The water in the river is still low;
there will be high water about the end of May or beginning
of June. It is 55 versts from Minusinsk to Shusha. The
local steamers make irregular trips; there is no timetable,
but, on the whole, once navigation begins they will probably
run more or less regularly and without any unusual delays.
I would very much like you to come here if you could
manage it—if only Mitya is released soon.

By the way, Anyuta asked me who I was going to invite
to the wedding; I invite all of you, only I do not know
whether it would not perhaps be better to telegraph the

    

invitations! As you know, N.K. has been confronted with a
tragi-comic condition—she must get married immediately(sic!)
or back to Ufa! Since I am not at all disposed to allow that,
we have already begun “bothering” the authorities (mainly
for identification papers, without which we cannot get
married), so that we shall be able to marry before the Fast of

St. Peter[1]

;

we permit ourselves to hope that these strict
authorities will consider this a sufficiently “immediate”
marriage?! I am inviting the people from Tesinskoye (they are
already writing that I shall certainly need witnesses) and I
hope they will be allowed to come.

Regards to all.

My kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

I almost forgot—Nadya tells me that some books on
philosophy were on their way to me, and that they went
past here to Irkutsk. Why is it that I have never heard
anything about this? Has some letter been lost? I would
ask Anyuta to find out what happened.

May 17, 1898 
 

This week, Mother dearest, I received Manyasha’s letter
of May 1.

I have not yet received my books but I hope to get them
soon. Nadezhda Konstantinovna made detailed
arrangements for them in Minusinsk.

It is probably not worth while subscribing to a
newspaper; I hope to get Syn Otechestva from Tesinskoye.

The weather here is still foul—wind and rain. Spring
just can’t settle down.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all. Have I got the address right?

June 7, 1898

I received your long letter of May 20 the day before
yesterday, Mother dearest, merci.  Last time  I  forgot to
tell you that I had received the box of books in Minusinsk
and brought it from there
myself.[2]


I cannot understand why you have not had any letters
from me for a long  time;   I have  been  writing   to   you
every Sunday “from time immemorial”. 
 

Our wedding has been somewhat delayed. I handed in an
application for the necessary papers to be sent to us a month
ago, and myself went to the police chief in Minusinsk to
enquire the reason for the delay. It turned out that the
“status sheet” has not yet (Siberian ways!) been received
in Minusinsk although I have been here in exile over a year
(the “status sheet” is a paper identifying the exiled person
and without it the police chief knows nothing about me and
cannot give me any certificate). It has to be obtained from
the Krasnoyarsk prison authorities—I am afraid the police
chief will not hurry with this. In any case there cannot be
a wedding earlier than
July.[1]

I asked him to allow the
people to come from Tes to my wedding and he refused
outright on the grounds that one political exile in Minusinsk
(Raichin) got leave of absence to go to a village last March
and disappeared.... My arguments that there was no reason
to fear that the Tes people would disappear had no effect
on him.
 

The Tes people have been given permission to stay in
Tes till autumn, then they will move to Minusinsk.

I think I have already written you about steamer traffic
on the Yenisei. The water is still high—it is even rising
again; it is very hot and the snow is probably melting in
the forests on the mountains. The steamers here (they
are all tugs) do not run to a schedule; they take two days
and sometimes more to get to Minusinsk from Krasnoyarsk.
From Minusinsk it is 55 versts by road to Shusha. I hope
I shall get a telegram from you if Mitya is released and
you decide to come to us. Yelizaveta Vasilyevna is worried
that the journey may be too much for you. If you can
travel second class on the railway I do not think it will be too
tiring.

Regards to all. I am anxiously awaiting a letter from
Anyuta. Did she receive Voprosy Filosofii?

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

June 14, 1898

I received a letter dated May 30 from Manyasha, Mother
dearest; tell her merci for it. But why does she not say a
word about Voprosy Filosofii that I sent on May 14? Did
she receive the book? (I sent it at Anyuta’s request; Manyasha
writes that my letters of May 10 and 17 have been received.)

Life goes on as usual. I think Nadya is going to write
today.

We are now having real summer weather. The heat is
exceptional—Y.V. finds it very difficult. Nadya and I
have begun bathing and have gone over to a summer system.

There is little news, and what there is is bad. In
Tesinskoye Comrade Yefimov (a worker from Yekaterinoslav)
has gone mad; he is suffering from persecution mania and
Gleb has taken him to hospital. There has been a very
nasty affair which concerns Yuly in Turukhansk; one of
the exiles (a scandal-monger) made all sorts of silly
accusations against him and they had to part company; Yuly
is now living alone, is ill, his nerves are all to pieces and
he cannot work. God save us from these “exile colonies”
and exile “scandals”! Yuly has asked his father to try
to get him transferred somewhere else, no matter where.

I am quite well (Nadya and Y.V., too). I am
finishing the translation and shall then go back to my work
again.[1] I have been informed that the collection of my
articles is soon to be printed.
 

Regards to all. Is Mitya working? He should have some
regular work, just “reading” in general is not much use.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

If anybody should be coming here ask Manyasha to send
me from among my books (1) Borovikovsky, Zakony
grazhdanskiye (Vol. X, Part 1), and (2) Ustav grazhdanskogo
sudoproizvodstva (pocket edition).

July 15, 1898

Yesterday I received your letter of June 27. 
 

I had a letter from the doctor yesterday, about N. Y.—
he shot himself with a revolver. He was buried on June 23.
He left a letter for Gleb, and manuscripts, also for him.
They say he asked me to be given a message to the effect
that he died full of faith in life and not from disappointment. 
 

I did not expect such a sad ending. Probably the trouble
caused by that scandal-monger had a terrible effect on him.

 


I believe I have already written about a box of books
addressed to me from Vilno (I have not yet received it).
Can those be the books that have gone on to Irkutsk? When
I get them I will inform you. By the way, the mix-up over
my books worries me far less (I have plenty of books) than
the mix-up over the library book (which you say you will
return in a few days). I did not anticipate such an
indescribably lengthy delay! So all our efforts to avoid delays,
to manage the return in six weeks instead of six months,
have been a waste of time, have they? If so, it will be a very
sad state of affairs, especially as all my chances of using
the St. Petersburg libraries came to an end when N.K.
left. I have even thought of asking you whether you could
see the librarian yourself and persuade him to give you
exact terms for the despatch of books, time of sending,
general punctuality, etc. It would not seem a very
difficult thing to do and yet in eighteen months absolutely
nothing has come of it. I think it’s about time we gave it
up—it is no joke trying to do battle against “long distances”.
 

I am extremely surprised that you have not received
Voprosy Filosofii. It would be a pity for it to get lost, for it
is a competently written book and not a cheap one; the set,
furthermore, would be broken up. I addressed it to Maria
Ulyanova by registered post on May 15, I still have the
receipt. Could I have sent it to the wrong place? (I may
have sent it to your address at Sobachya Ploshchadka).
Please get all the information you can and let me know. I
will present the receipt at the post office and claim
compensation for the loss. I always inform you in my letters of
books that I send. So, if a book is a long time coming, you
may expect information about it in due course. It seems
as if another of my letters has gone astray.

Sergei Ivanovich has written to me that he will be glad
to have the post of doctor in Sredny Kolymsk. I think
he is right. It is better to have a job; without it you go under
in exile. He will probably be able to live there well enough
on 2,500 rubles a year.

Nadya and I are making a fair copy of the Webbs’ book,
I have to post it, by the terms of the contract, in the middle
of August. I am utterly fed up with this copying (about
1,000 pages for the two of us). The translation was
interesting, for it is a very, very useful book.

Yesterday Nadya received a letter from Apollinariya
Alexandrovna in Krasnoyarsk. She is being sent to the village
of Kazachinskoye in Yeniseisk District, about 100 versts
up the river from Yeniseisk. There are a number of
political exiles there—Lepeshinsky, Lingling, Rostkovsky,
Grigoryeva. She has been in Krasnoyarsk for about 10 days and
is now apparently continuing her way to her place of exile.

When do they intend to release Mitya? I did not expect
them to make such a fuss over nothing. And where will he
go when they let him out?

Kiss Mother, and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Are you going to the Caucasus with Mark or not?

I was very glad to learn that you have sent the money
for the publication to the écrivain. A big merci for that.

    

I shall now await events. But tell them to reserve 25 copies
for me as author—I will send them to comrades and
acquaintances. When you get them, send me 12 or 15 copies at
once; I will write to you about the rest and tell you where
to send them.

August 2, 1898

A few days ago I received your letter of July 15, Mother
dearest.

I hope Mitya will have been released by the time you
receive this. His release has been promised so many times
that he will probably be free by autumn. The investigation
of his case is dragging on much too long.

I think Manyasha’s plan to go to Brussels is a good one.
She can probably study there better than in Switzerland.
She will probably soon be able to cope with the French
language. They say that the climate there is good. Nadya
has an
acquaintance[1]

who lived in Belgium for about five
years and is now preparing to go back there from Russia
(to Liége). He is married to one of Nadya’s close
friends.[2]

Nadya is writing to her today asking her to write to
Manyasha (in Podolsk) and give her all the information and
addresses that might be useful to her.

If the janitor at your old flat says that the postman brought
“a yellow book” in May, it must have been the Voprosy
Filosofii that I sent. So we may hope that the book has not
been lost and that we can still get it back. I will wait
another week to see what Mark can find out about it at
work, and then report the loss.

I am very glad Anyuta intends to inform everyone not
to send anything to the address of
S.M.[5] That foolish

    

person recently received something for me and wants to make
a whole “affair” of it.... Of course I pay no attention to these
foolish antics (probably caused by our quarrel with the
Minusinsk crowd) and I shall receive the books that were
sent to her. But it would be pleasanter to manage
without her. If there are still people who have not been
informed, let Anyuta write to them. A few days ago I
received some of the books (mostly on philosophy) that
Anyuta bought for me. The books for me that have now
been received are still in Minusinsk; they include the
continuation of the philosophical series.

Among the books the following got in by accident—
I think they are Anyuta’s—Baedeker, Suisse, and Jahrbuch
des Unterrichtswesens in der Schweiz, 1892, 1893 and 1894
(three volumes); Anna should write and tell me what to do
with them. If I am to return them to her, should it be now
or in the autumn (when we intend sending a box of books by
rail).

[Apollinariya Alexandrovna
Yakubova][3]

is being sent
to the village of Kazachinskoye, Yeniseisk District (I
believe I wrote this before); it is on the post road a hundred
or more versts upstream from Yeniseisk. The political
exiles there are Lingling, Rostkovsky and others. She has
not yet written to us from there.

The Tes people expect to get transferred in the middle
of August.

A detailed letter has arrived from the doctor in
Verkholensk in which he describes the death of N.Y. Fedoseyev,
and returns a letter from Anna to N.Y. which arrived after
his death (he does not know whose letter it is) and asks
what to do with the 25 rubles. (They are collecting money
there for a memorial.) They (the comrades in Verkholensk)
have also undertaken to pay N.Y.’s debts (about 80
rubles).

The doctor writes that the filthy accusations made
against him by some scoundrel (also a political exile)
concerning money affairs had a very adverse effect on N.Y., and
he decided not to take any money from anybody (and he

    

stuck to his decisions), so that he suffered extreme hardship,
could not work, and, as the doctor put it, “when he
realised he could not work he decided that he would not live”....
After his death a telegram arrived in Verkholensk to the
effect that Maria
Germanovna[4]

had been given permission
to join him....

 


Kisses for you and regards to all. I wish Mark a pleasant
journey and a good holiday.

Yours,

V. U.

Y. V. and Nadya send regards.

August 16

This week, Mother dearest, I received Anyuta’s letter
of July 30. I received it on Monday, August 10, in
Minusinsk where I had gone to have my teeth seen
to.[2] I was
very surprised to get this letter, which came, as it
turned, out, by express train. Incidentally, the transfer of
letters from this express train (which goes to Tomsk) to
an ordinary train usually involves a loss of time. On
Tuesday August 11, I received a Moscow newspaper for
July 29 by ordinary train and the letter by express was
sent on July 30, i.e., not much quicker.

I cannot send letters by express train from here; to do
so I should need friends in
Ob[3] to whom I could send
letters for posting on the express.

Try once again sending a letter by express and we will
see when it arrives.

Today I am sending my Webb translation to St.
Petersburg. I have written that they should send my fees to you;
if the écrivain does not know your address, inform him for
this purpose.

There ought to be some news about my collected articles,
but there is none and Nadya and I are beginning to think it
a fiasco....

 


Manyasha, I think, is wrong to hesitate. It would be
useful for her to live abroad and study in one of the capitals,
and studying in Belgium is especially convenient. What
subjects does she think of reading?

 

You see, I was right in postponing the report that
Voprosy had been lost; the book has not been lost but has been
delayed so long that the reason for sending it is no longer
valid.

Yours,

V.  U.

Anyuta,

By this mail I am sending you a registered packet
containing Negri, Tempeste, and the catalogue you asked for. The
address is the same as in this letter. Acknowledge receipt.

At the same time as your letter I received news from
Archangel that M.G. also shot herself (July 18) two days
after she received news of N.Y.’s death. A terribly tragic
story. And the wild slanders of some scoundrel by the name
of Yukhotsky (a political exile! exiled to Verkholensk) played
a major part in this finale. N.Y. was terribly shaken by them
and disheartened. Because of them he decided not to accept
help from anyone and he suffered terrible privations. They
say that two or three days before his death he received a
letter in which the slander was repeated. The devil knows what
it all means! For people in exile, these “exile scandals”
are the worst thing of all, but I would never have believed
that they could assume such proportions! The slanderer was
exposed a long time ago and condemned by all comrades,
but I never thought that N.Y. (who had some experience
of exile scandals) would take it so much to heart.

The day before yesterday I received Shakhov,
Gumplowicz and Izvestiya (two issues, January and March); the
delay of one mail day was the fault of our postman.

Yuly hopes to get out of Turukhansk soon. In Tesinskoye
they are having a wedding and will soon be moving to

Minusinsk.[1]

Basil has got a job as a technician with a local
industrialist.

Yours,

V. U.

 

Notes
 

[1]
The wedding was that of G. M. Krzhizhanovsky and Z. P.

[2]
Lenin was allowed to travel to Minusinsk to have his teeth treated;
he stayed there three days, from the 10th to the 12th of August.
Since there was no experienced dentist in Minusinsk, Lenin
applied to the Governor of Yeniseisk for permission to go to
Krasnoyarsk for a week to have his teeth treated. Permission was
granted and at the beginning of September Lenin left Shushenskoye for
Krasnoyarsk, where he stayed at the house of a Social-Democrat
in exile, P. A. Krasikov. Lenin took advantage of the trip to work
in Yudin’s library and to meet Krasnoyarsk Social-Democrats.

Ob—a railway station on the left bank of the river of that name;
as there was no bridge across the river at that time, express trains
went only as far as Ob station.

August 26

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your telegram of
the 21st about Mitya’s release and also your letter and
Anyuta’s. I was very glad to get all the news, especially
about Mitya. His being released means the investigation
is finished; now it will be interesting to know what the
prosecuting authority is preparing for
him,[3] I am waiting
for news of how you are getting fixed up for the winter.

Anyuta’s letter is very interesting and I was very glad
to learn that my fears of a fiasco were
premature.[1]

I am
sending a registered package (to the same address as the
letter) containing the manuscript of an article written a
few days ago. Please send it on to the écrivain with a request
to try and place it somewhere; if it is too late for the
collection of articles, try one of the journals (Mir Bozhy, or
perhaps Nauchnoye Obozreniye would be more convenient).[4]
I don’t know whether it is convenient for me to send
manuscripts direct to St. Petersburg. I did that with Webb
because the deadline (September 1) was only a fortnight
away, but I don’t know whether it gave rise to any
dissatisfaction there. For the time being I shall continue
sending them to you.

I have already written about having received
Gumplowicz, Shakhov, Wolfe’s Izvestiya and books from Friedmann.

I thank
“Auntie”[2]

very much for her regards, etc. It is

    

a pity that there are only regards. I am not at all to blame
that I “do not reply”. What does Anyuta think? Should
I answer now or would it be better to wait, if I have to?

 


The weather here is showing signs of autumn, although
the last few days have been very fine. That our house will
not be a suitable one to winter in is something we do not
think about and are not afraid of. It is always possible to
find other lodgings.

Yours,

V. U.

What about Manyasha? Is she still hesitating or has
she at last come to a decision?

The article referred to is “On the Question of Our Factory

it in The Development of Capitalism in Russia. The article was
not published either in Mir Bozhy or Nauchnoye Obozreniye
but
first appeared in Economic Studies and Essays

Mir Bozhy (The Wide World—literally God’s World)—a liberal
literary and popular scientific monthly. It was published in St.

Krasnoyarsk, September 16, 1898

I have been living here for several days, Mother dearest.
I expect to leave tomorrow if the steamer is not a day
late. I shall have to leave without A.M. and E.E. (I think I
wrote to you from Minusinsk, didn’t I, that we had arranged
to travel together?) E.E. has been admitted to the local
hospital; one of the doctors is an acquaintance of A.M.’s,
and E.E., it seems, has been decently provided for and
feels better. The doctors have not yet been able to give an
exact, diagnosis—either it is just a pain caused by a blow
(she fell from a carriage about six or eight weeks ago). or
an abscess of the liver, a serious complaint that is difficult
to cure and requires lengthy treatment. I am very sorry
for A.M., who has not recovered from the death of her
child and her own illness; she becomes so agitated at times
that she almost has nervous fits. I would rather not leave
her here alone, but my time is up and I must leave. I am
asking the local comrades to visit her. As a result of my
trip and of the need to help A.M. and make certain
purchases, my finances are in a sorry state. Please send Yelizaveta
Vasilyevna (from whom I have received a loan) about a
half of the sum that should be sent you for the (whole) Webb
translation (sent to St. Petersburg on

August 15[1]

).

If it
has not yet been sent I think it will be better to wait a little
while (or get someone to bring the money if the
opportunity arises). I shall not experience a crisis so there is no
particular hurry.
 

I am very pleased with my trip here; I have had my
teeth treated and have had a breath of fresh air after
eighteen months in Shushenskoye. Few though the people in
Krasnoyarsk may be, it is nevertheless pleasant, after
Shusha, to see people and talk about something else besides
shooting and Shushenskoye “news”. The journey back is
quite a long one (five days or so); the Yenisei steamer makes
devilishly slow headway against the stream. I shall have
to stay below decks because the weather has turned
unusually cold (it goes without saying that I am wearing my
winter clothes [and here I have also bought a sheepskin
coat for Nadya] so I shall not suffer from the cold). I have
got in a supply of candles and books, so as not to die of
boredom on the boat. I shall probably have travelling with me
Lepeshinskaya, the wife of an exile, who is going to work in
the village of Kuraginskoye (about 40 versts from Minusinsk,
where our comrade Kurnatovsky lives); her husband has
been transferred to the same place. Yesterday I heard the
good news that Yuly had been transferred, but I do not
yet know exactly where to. The last letter I received from
home was from Anyuta dated August 24. Thank her very
much for it and for the books (Neue Zeit, reprints from the
Archiv,
Kokhanskaya’s[2] biography and others).

I shall answer when I arrive in Shusha, in about ten days,
that is; it is a pretty long delay but there is nothing I can
do about it.

Yours,

V. U.

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

I have just seen A.M. and learned that Elvira Ernestovna
is much better and that the doctors do not think she is in
any danger; they promise that in about eight days she will
be discharged in good health and will be able to travel to
Minusinsk. That is very pleasant news.

 
Notes

The translation was sent on August 16 (see Letter No. 53).—Ed.

October 11, 1898

This week I have received no news from you, Mother
dearest. I suppose you are fixing things up with Mitya and
the tourists that have arrived. It seems that Anyuta’s trip
was not very successful. That is a great pity because one
does not manage to go to the Crimea very often. How is
Manyasha? Has she left yet? Did they arrange details of
addresses and letters with her? If they did, write and tell
me and I will write to her from here. I am greatly surprised
at the stubborn silence of St. Petersburg; I sent the Webb
translation on August 15 and up to now they have not even
acknowledged receipt of it (I sent it by registered post,
of course, addressed to P.B., care of the warehouse). There
is also amazing silence about the collection of articles;
the last letter was dated August 7 which said that proofs
of over a hundred pages had been read, and means that
the book was half ready. Surely there could not be a delay
of more than a month. Probably it is a fiasco, but even
so I expected them to send me the book (by registered
post—there is nothing inconvenient in that). I am quite
at a loss, but Nadya and I are more and more inclined to
think it a fiasco. That would be unfortunate in the extreme.
I have finished the rough copy of my “markets” and have
begun polishing
it.[1]

The writing of the fair copy is
proceeding simultaneously, so I am thinking of sending it
piecemeal and having it printed as I send it, to prevent any

    

delay (I expect to send the first package off in a month’s
time at the very latest); if the printing of the book begins in
December, it could be in time for this season. It will be
necessary, however (if the previous book was a fiasco), to
find a publisher and conclude a contract with him. I am
writing all this in case Anyuta sees the écrivain—she often goes
to St. Petersburg—or learns something by chance, and in
general (even if she does not see or learn anything) it is
interesting to talk and hear other people’s opinions.

We have no news at all. The weather is cold—soon it
will be winter. Autumn this year is not so good as last year.

Regards to all,


Yours,


V. U.

I almost forgot to tell you that with the last post
(October 8) I sent you a registered packet containing two books,
one issue of Nauchnoye Obozreniye and one of Voprosy
Filosofii i Psikhologii; Anyuta asked me to return them both,
and I must apologise for the delay.

November 1, 1898

The day before yesterday I received your letter of
October 14, Mother dearest, and was very glad to get it. Today
I have Gleb staying with me; he has come alone for three
days. E.E. is still ill, the illness is a serious one, and she
will probably have to be sent to St. Petersburg or Moscow,
the local doctors are no good.

I am not writing much because I am late for the post—
we have been out walking all day. The weather here is
excellent—clear, frosty, calm days; there is no snow yet.
Regards to all. Did Mark’s health improve in the Crimea?
I am expecting a letter soon from Anna. How is Mitya
getting on?

Please, send the enclosed letter on to A. P.
Sklyarenko[1]

;
I have lost his address.

If Anyuta is really thinking of going to St. Petersburg,
it would be good if she were to do something about my big

composition.[2]

I am sending the first two chapters soon
(in a week or ten days) direct to Anyuta; I shall at least
know what is happening to them. Then I shall write about
my plans for this composition.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

I have still not received a letter from Manyasha.

Anyuta,

Today I am sending to Mother’s address two notebooks
of the “markets”. These are the first two chapters, about
a quarter or a fifth of the entire work. Altogether there are
eight chapters and I am now finishing work on the third,
so that by January it will most probably be finished
because Nadya copies it quite quickly, as I write it. Although
I am abridging the first rough copy very considerably it is
still an enormous size. In the first two chapters I reckon
there are about 270,000 letters, and if you count 33,000
letters as a printer’s signature, there will be about eight
and a half signatures. The whole book, therefore, will be
about 35 or 40 signatures; I still hope to keep it down to
35, but even that will be a thick book (560 pages). It is
desirable to have it printed in a big format with average-sized
type, so that there will be about 2,400 letters to a page
and more than 33,000 letters to the signature—that will
be more convenient since there will be fewer pages.

As far as concerns the actual publication, apparently
we shall have to place our hopes on finding a publisher. If
you happen to be in St. Petersburg, perhaps you will discuss
it with the écrivain. Would Mrs. M. Vodovozova undertake
to publish the
book?[2] [I do not count on an independent
edition because I consider the collection of articles to be
a flop—although up to now I have not heard a single word
about it or about the translation! If it should so happen that
this is not the case, our own edition will also be possible;
then it will be necessary to find a good, intelligent proof-

    

reader, pay him properly and make it a condition for him
to send off every signature immediately it is read. ]

Printing can (and should) begin now (I say “should”
because otherwise it will not be out by spring); it can then
be sent by chapters and I promise that I shall not be late.
If a publisher is found, a detailed contract must be
concluded with him, and one absolutely definite condition must
be the despatch of proofs [it is very difficult for anyone
but the author to find misprints, for instance, in tables;
and then there may be corrections and addenda, etc.). In
spring the écrivain wrote to me that it could be printed
in serial form in Nauchnoye Obozreniye or some other journal.
Of course I am not against that, but it is hardly feasible
for any journal to take such a big thing—that would be very
unusual. It is far more likely that they would take a chapter
or two for publication. The second chapter, and the first as
well, are independent and complete. Having this in mind,
we hurried to send off those parts that were ready
immediately. The only thing is, that if they are given to a journal
an agreement must be reached on the deadline for printing
them and also on the author’s right to publish the whole book
without waiting for the journal to complete
publication.[3]

I am sending the Preface to the book, not for it to
be printed (it will probably have to be revised or added to
after a
time)[4] but in order to give an impression of the
plan of the book as a whole. I will send the summaries for
the table of contents with each chapter. If such detailed
summaries are not required (although in my opinion detailed
contents are more convenient for the reader), they may be
abridged and only the titles of the sections
left.[1]

By the
way, these section titles should not be set in bold-face type
or italics (that is too imposing) but should, on the contrary,
be set in the smallest available type. That would take up
less space and be more in accordance with the purpose of
the headings. As far as the tables are concerned, I also
think they would best be set in small type, so as to take
as little space as possible.

I feel that all these details may prove to be of no value—

    

but for my part, at least, I want to do all I can. It is quite
possible that the écrivain will want, or will agree, to take
the matter into his own hands—the one pity is, however,
that he is unbelievably and incomprehensibly unpunctual
in maintaining communications and is, apparently,
absolutely incorrigible in this respect. In general, he is rather too
lavish with his kindness; his wife, for instance, herself read
the proofs of the beginning of the collection of articles—
a tedious job that takes up a lot of time. Why should she
have undertaken it when she already has so much to do?
Under the circumstances it would have been much more
convenient to hire (even if it has to be one they recommend)
a special
proof-reader[5] and demand that he is punctual
in his work and informs you of the despatch of every
signature of the proofs.

Here I have to stop. Please answer quickly, if only to
acknowledge receipt of the manuscript.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes

The detailed table of contents to The Development of Capitalism

[2]
This refers to The Development of Capitalism in Russia by
Vladimir Ilyin, which M. I. Vodovozova published at the end of

The first six sections of Chapter III of The Development of
Capitalism in Russia were published as a separate article in the journal
Nachalo (The Beginning) No. 3, March 1899, under the title “The
Ousting of Corvée by Capitalist Economy in Contemporary Russian
Agriculture”. An editorial note accompanying the article said,
“This is an extract from the author’s extensive investigation of
the development of capitalism in Russia.”





[4]
Lenin later made an addition to the Preface of The Development
of Capitalism in Russia which wad published as a postscript.





[5]
Lenin’s sister Anna undertook to correct the author’s proofs of
The Development of Capitalism in Russia; her brother Dmitry
helped her; the proofs of the statistical tables were read by V. A.

November 11, 1898

We received your letter, Manyasha, and were very glad
to have it. We have now got out the maps and are trying
to find out just where Brussels is—the devil take it. We
have discovered it and have given it some thought—a
stone’s throw from London, and from Paris and from
Germany, which puts it pretty well in the very centre of
Europe.... Yes, I do envy you. During the first period of my
exile I decided not to look at a map of European Russia
or Europe; there was always such a bitter taste in my mouth
when I opened those maps and looked at the various black
dots on them. Now it does not worry me, I have learned to
be patient and look at the maps more calmly; we even begin
to wonder which of those dots it would be interesting to
reach later on. During the first half of my exile I looked
mostly backwards, I suppose, but now I am looking ahead.
Oh well, qui vivra,

verra.[1]

As for newspapers and books,
please get hold of whatever you can. Send all sorts of
catalogues from second-hand booksellers and bookshops in
all languages. There is a request I should like to make of
you today, but I have decided to put it off till next time.
I would remind you of what I wrote to you or to Anna last
year—the most interesting newspapers are the official
organs that contain verbatim reports of parliamentary
discussions. If you find out where such newspapers are sold
(are there only Belgian or are there also French and English
newspapers in Brussels?) and send the interesting issues

    

(you keep up with the press, I hope?), it will be fine. I
advise you not to confine yourself to Belgian newspapers
but to subscribe to some German paper; you will not forget
the language, and will get excellent reading material; the cost
of the newspapers is not great.

Are you going home for Christmas?

Yours,

V. U.

After a long wait I have received my collection of articles
at
last.[2]

I will ask Anyuta to send you a copy.

November 15, 1898

How are you managing to winter in Podolsk, Mother
dearest? This is not a very merry winter for you—Mark has
to live away from you, Mitya is chained to Podolsk. He did
not answer my questions about how he has to do his army
service—in the ranks or as an assistant surgeon? Is there
any information about his case, when it will end and how?
Or none at all? How is Mark keeping? Is he not miserable
alone in Moscow or is he up to his neck in work at his office
and his evening lectures (does he still give
them?)?[3]

We have no news. The only change is in amusements—
now that winter has come I go skating instead of shooting;
I recall the old days and find that I have not forgotten
how, although it is about ten years since I last skated.
Nadya also wants to learn to skate, but I am not sure
whether she will manage it.

Regards to all,


Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

Anyuta,

I forgot to write to you by the last post that I had
received Neue Zeit then. Yesterday I got a bill from A.M.
Kalmykova. I have accumulated a debt of about eight
rubles and still go on ordering and ordering. I cannot
understand why I still have not had the fees for the translation I
sent to St. Petersburg as long ago as August 15! If the money
comes, please send fifty rubles or so to the book warehouse,
and if it does not come by the time this letter arrives, I

    

do not know what to do. If it is possible, it would be a
good thing to send even ten rubles to the warehouse; as far
as the fee for the translation is concerned, I have been told
it will be paid in any case (there should not be any
objections from the censors)—and so it is only a matter of time.

Last time I wrote to you I asked you to send the book
to various acquaintances of mine but forgot that you do not
know the
addresses.[4] I do not know the Archangel
addresses myself. Today at a guess I am writing to
M. E. Grigoryev[1]

at that sawmill where he works. I think you have had
some correspondence with Archangel; would it not be
better, then, if you were to send them to your acquaintances
to be handed on? If that cannot be done, leave them until
you get the addresses. The address of Lalayants is: Is.
Christoph. Lalayants, House No. 11, corner of Bogoslovskaya
and Krutoi streets, Voronezh. It would be a good idea to
send a copy to the Samaran, who writes in Nauchnoye

Obozreniye.[2]

He is in St. Petersburg, but I don’t know his
address.

Am I not loading you down too much with requests?

Wolfe’s are advertising a library of French classics at
ten kopeks an issue. Have you seen what sort of an edition it
is?

Yours,

V. U.

I was amazed to read that Labriola is being published
in Russian! I can imagine in what distorted form!

Could it have been you who translated Labriola?

I read in Frankfurter
Zeitung[5] a very interesting article
about the Stuttgart
Parteitag.[6] We are thinking of
subscribing to that newspaper next year. Do you read any
foreign newspaper?

 
Notes
 

[1]
The letter has been lost.—Ed
,—Lenin

[2]
This refers to P. P. Maslov.—Ed.
 



[3]
This apparently refers to Mark Yelizarov’s teaching at evening
and Sunday schools for workers.





[4]
The letter mentioned here has not been found. It is known from
the letter of November 11, 1898, that Lenin received the copies
due to him as author of the book Economic Studies and Essays
which he requested be sent to a number of comrades and
acquaintances.





[5]
Frankfurter Zeitung—a daily newspaper,  organ of big German
stockbrokers;   published   in   Frankfurt am Main  from   1856  to
1943. It reappeared in 1949 as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
and is the mouthpiece of the West German monopolists.





[6]
Stuttgart Parteitag—the Stuttgart Congress of the German
Social-Democratic Party held October 3-8, 1898, which first discussed
revisionism in the German Social-Democratic Party. A special
statement, sent to the congress by Eduard Bernstein who was
living in exile, was read; it contained an exposition and defence
of the opportunist views he had earlier expounded in Die Neue
Zeit in a series of articles under the general heading of “Problems
of Socialism”. There was no unity among Bernstein’s opponents
at the congress; fearing a split in the party, some of them, led by
Bebel and Kautsky, tried to combine the theoretical struggle
against Bernsteinism with cautious internal party practice; others
(Rosa Luxemburg, Parvus), a minority, adopted a much more
militant position and tried to get a more profound and extensive
discussion and showed no fear of a split. The congress did not pass
any resolution on this issue but from the   discussion and from
other resolutions it was clear that most of the delegates remained
loyal to the ideas of revolutionary Marxism.

Today, Mother dearest, I have to write a long business
letter to Anyuta. For this reason I shall not write to you,
especially as Nadya has already compiled a very lengthy
description of our life here and I have nothing to add to it.
Her story is true in the main—only there is some
exaggeration about my work on the
“markets”.[1]


Yours,

V. U.

Ask Mitya to send Pamyatnaya knizhka Tulskoi
gubernii[2]

to Alexei Pavlovich Sklyarenko as soon as possible; I don’t 
 know his address.

Anyuta,

I received two of your letters together—dated November
1 and 4. There is a good side to the publication having been
handed over to Vodovozova; at any rate, the work is certain
to be done. Her account for the Studies seems to be
perfectly correct and the smallness of the fee is due to the small
number of
copies.[5] I cannot, of course, accept such a fee
for the “markets”. I intend to take advantage of
Vodovozova’s offer (if you see her, convey to her, of course, many
thanks from me) to publish my “markets”—as for the
financial conditions, I leave it to you (if it will not be too

    

much trouble) to discuss that with her; I do not know which
is better, a definite fee or “all the net profit”. The more
advantageous of those two methods of payment must, of
course, be chosen, especially as I do not need the money in
a hurry. The most important of the conditions attending
publication is to ensure perfectly good proof-reading. Unless
this is done it really is not worth while publishing anything.
The proof-reading of the Studies was very bad. Apart from
those misprints distorting the
meaning[3]

that I sent
you,[6]
there are numerous minor ones that comrades are already
complaining to me about. It is absolutely necessary to have
a very intelligent, professional proof-reader; that must be
made an absolute condition and I am even willing to pay
such a proof-reader double in view of the author’s being
unable to read the proofs himself. This is especially true
of tables—there are always mistakes galore, and in the
“markets” there are a lot of tables. Then (even if you have
the best proof-reader) I must have copies of the final page
proofs sent to me immediately, signature by signature,
and I will send you a list of misprints. The delay in issuing
the book because of this will be (if they are sent punctually)
at most a month; that is no great misfortune as long as the
book is printed decently. With regard to the date of issue—
the work can begin now (we have the third chapter in a fair
copy and in a few days I shall finish the fourth, that is,
half of the book; the second half is much easier, so I can
confidently undertake to send to Moscow the last chapter by
February 15, or even earlier); this would be particularly
convenient for me, because I would have time to send in not only the
misprints to the first signatures but perhaps some more
important changes. The format and the type should provide
for about 2,400 letters to a page; the whole work would
then be no more than 30 signatures, say 500 pages in round
figures (more pages would probably be too many and would
be bulky for the reader). Lastly, with regard to the chart
in Chapter II—special attention will be needed to make
sure there are no mistakes in it. Please talk to Vodovozova

    

about all this and answer me as soon as possible after you
receive this letter. We shall send Chapters III and IV when
they are finished, in about a fortnight.

Please send Manyasha another three copies of the Studies. 
 Alexander
Leontyevich’s[4]

address is Gudina’s House,
Opernaya Street, Archangel. I have sent them to all the
comrades here. Another copy must be sent to the Samaran who
writes in Nauchnoye Obozreniye.

Out of the third of the fee you have received, a half will
cover the money sent by Mitya for Yelizaveta Vasilyevna.
From the other half, please send a half to Kalmykova’s
warehouse (I have run into debt there, and I order a lot
of things) and use the remainder to subscribe to journals
and newspapers for 1899; it is time, especially for the
foreign publications.

Russkiye Vedomosti for one year—8 rubles 50 kopeks (pay for ten months for me);
Russkoye Bogatstvo for one year—9 rubles
Mir Bozhy for one year—8 rubles
Nivafor 1899 —7 rubles
Frankfurter Zeitung
for the first quarter of 1899—4 rubles 70 kopeks
Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik, herausgegeben von Heinrich Braun. For 1899—12 marks.

We here greatly appreciate newspapers and journals,
especially those that arrive in good time; that is why I
ask you to subscribe as early as possible.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

(Blos has been given to Basil, we no longer have it.)

November 28, 1898

I have received letters from you and Mitya dated
November 9, Mother dearest.

With regard to telegrams to me here—you must bear in
mind that our postman goes to Minusinsk on Monday and
Thursday in the morning. This means that you must send
telegrams on Sunday or Wednesday morning, so that I
receive them on Tuesday or Friday morning (these are our
mail days, local Shushenskoye
“holidays”).[1]


One letter came from Manyasha and we answered
it,[2]

but we have not yet had any more from her.

I am very, very glad you like Podolsk. It is a pity, of
course, that Mark cannot live with you.

I have another request to make of Anyuta—to add to
the list of subscriptions Trudy imperatorskogo Volnogo
ekonomicheskogo obshchestva, price 3 rubles a year (6 issues),
including delivery—if that publication is still appearing.

If you take out the subscriptions through Wolfe’s they
already have my address because I receive their Izvestiya.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all. 
 

Y.V. sends regards to all.

I have finished one half of my book and am now sure
that it will be shorter instead of longer than I assumed.
 

Mitya,

Your information about my shooting is inaccurate. Who
told you about it? Maybe Anyuta made some chronological
errors and produced some ancient myths about hares as
up-to-date news. In the autumn I made quite a good kill
among the hares here—there are masses of them on the islands
in the Yenisei and we soon got fed up with them. Prominsky
shot several dozen because he wanted the skins for a coat.

It is more interesting to shoot black grouse and partridge,
but more difficult. In July I got a few grey-hen, but now
people go after them on horseback with rifles; in winter
you can’t get near enough on foot (except on rare occasions).
For partridge (autumn) you need a good dog and my Jenny
is either too young or simply no good. In winter they mostly
catch partridges in traps and
snares.[3]


We now have a new attraction, a skating rink that takes
me away from shooting quite a lot.

Next summer I hope to go shooting much more—there
will be less work, the dog will be used to its job and it will
be my last (I hope) summer in Siberia.

All the best,


V. U.

December 6, 1898

I got your note, Mother dearest, that you added to
Anyuta’s letter. I am answering her in detail. I have nothing
new to say about myself—life goes on as usual. The weather
is still fine and today I am going out for the winter
shooting. Anatoly writes that he is ill, poor chap, probably with
typhus. Yuly is freezing in Turukhansk (2° below zero
in his room in the mornings) and is anxiously awaiting
a transfer. Yak. M. (Lyakhovsky) writes that 180 rubles
are needed for a memorial-stone to Fedoseyev, and that
so far only 70 rubles have been collected, and he asks all
acquaintances to be informed of
this.[1]

He writes that on
October 18, A. Yergin, Frelikh, Zmeyev, Alyushkevich,
Talalayev, Tyutryumova-Abramovich and Goldman arrived
at Alexandrovskaya Prison. All of them are on their way
to Yakutsk.

Yours,

V. U.

Anyuta and Mark,

I have received both your letters, thanks for them and
here is a detailed answer.

It is surprising that the écrivain rejected the proposal

    

to employ a professional proof-reader (for the Studies)—
there are numerous misprints, and I am particularly
worried about those that distort the meaning, a list of which
I sent to you and to him. I am expecting an answer in a
day or two as to whether they can be stuck in somewhere;
they are essential.

I think there is hardly any sense in undertaking an
edition of our own; first, it is desirable to establish permanent
relations with Vodovozova, who is suitable as a publisher;
second, the sum (needed for the edition) is very big,
and the matter is very tedious, complicated and difficult.
In doing it ourselves for the first time we are certain to
make all sorts of mistakes and I am very anxious that this
publication should be outwardly irreproachable, even if
it costs a few hundred rubles extra. Thirdly, there is no
very great difference in time; my letter will arrive by
Christmas and Vodovozova is arriving in February—it may
perhaps be possible to communicate with her in writing. And
how much time would be wasted (in the case of our own
edition) on travelling, searching, etc. It is very hard to
keep track of a publishing job from another town. Would
it not be better, therefore, to write to Vodovozova? Ask
her when she can start setting the book, how much time
it will take, will it be possible to issue the book before
the end of April, etc. As far as the terms are concerned,
I think it is better to take the net profit rather than fees per
signature. In the former case I would expect to receive about
one-third of the gross sum or even more; in the latter, to
make up such a sum it would be necessary to pay a minimum
of 75 rubles for each printer’s signature, which would be
burdensome and risky for the publisher.

I have finished four chapters and even the writing of
the fair copy will be finished today, so I shall be sending
you Chapters III and IV in a day or two. I hope you will
receive the whole book in February. If you are going to
read the manuscript, by the way, please send me your
remarks. In my rough copy I have marked off the pages of
the fair copy, so that I can send corrections. And, again,
about the Studies—send me any press reviews that you or
any acquaintances come across, because here I do not keep
up with the current press.
 

If small type and tables cost more to set, the publisher
will have to spend quite a lot on the “markets” because
there are many tables, and some diagrams as well. The
total volume of the book, as far as I can tell at present,
comes to about 450 pages at the rate of 2,400 letters to a
page, which is less than I anticipated. If the pages are like
those in Vodovozova’s publications (they are very widely
spaced with no more than 2,000 letters to a page) there
will be no less than 550 so smaller type is desirable. It is
very desirable to print all the tables in small type,
otherwise they will take up a lot of space, be less graphic and
not be taken in at a glance by the reader. The tables that are
printed sideways on a whole page are particularly
inconvenient (i.e., you have to turn the book round to read them).
All this is very important to the reader. It would be a good
thing to have the type used in the tables in the appendices
to Vodovozova’s book Zemlevladeniye i selskoye khozyaistvo;
all the tables in the second and other chapters should be
set in this type (most of the tables are in Chapter II; there
are fewer in the other chapters, but there are some).
You must talk to the publisher about all this and also about
sending me the proofs (as I have already written). To speed
up publication it could be done at two printing works,
Part 1 (the first four chapters) and Part 2 separately, with
the pages numbered individually. With regard to Mark’s
proposal to change the title and make it a two-volume
edition—I do not think this would be convenient. The more
modest and heavier-sounding title is better because of the
censorship; to change the title would mean that I would
have to make a large number of petty, and, therefore,
onerous changes in the text. It is not a good thing to split
it into two volumes. If you take the format and type of
the Studies as the standard, each volume would be smaller
than that book (and they could not be sold as separate
volumes because the composition is a single whole with cross
references to different chapters, etc.). As to price, I did
not expect it to be more than 3 rubles and consider a higher
price to be undesirable (and a lower price would mean
losing money). As many copies as possible should be
printed[2]

;

    

it is a pity that such a small number of the Studies was
put out. With regard to censorship obstacles to the
“markets”—I do not expect any, unless there is to be a period
of toughness and special severity against our people. If the
Studies sell well, the “markets” will probably sell better.
This should be impressed on the publisher. There is also
the question of the number of copies to be supplied to the
author (I hope you sent Manyasha another three copies of
the Studies).
I think we should take fifty, because this time
I shall have to send them to many people and sometimes
to exchange them for Zemstvo statistical publications.

Well, I think I have chattered away long enough—and
there must be many repetitions of what has been said
before in other equally long business letters! You must
be bored with reading all these repetitions. It is very much
like my writing—the first rough copy of the “markets”
I have scratched about and abridged most ruthlessly.

All the best,


V. U.

All our people send their regards.

December 12, 1898

From Anyuta I have received Neue Zeit and the report
of the Committee on Literacy, also a postcard dated
November 28. I am answering her on another page. Mail days
here are Tuesday and Friday, but that, of course, is not
what interests you. We receive Wednesday’s and Friday’s
newspapers, on the fourteenth day from the day of issue,
that is. It is, therefore, more convenient for you to write
on Tuesdays and Fridays (from Moscow, of course; about
Podolsk I do not know). Nadya and I have submitted an
application to go to Minusinsk for Christmas and stay there
for a
week.[5] We shall receive letters just the same, so
there is no need to change the address.

Yours,

V. U.

Anyuta,

Today I am sending a registered letter containing the
third and fourth chapters of the “markets” to Mother’s
address. I have made a more exact calculation of how much
I have written; in the first four chapters there are about
500,000
letters.[1]

That is fewer than I imagined (and the
second part will be less than the first). My fears were
groundless; the type that gives 2,000 letters to the page will

    

be quite all right. I have nothing against an edition of two
separate volumes—decide yourselves with the publisher.
The only thing is the figures—the figures!—they will get
them all wrong unless they send me the proofs to
correct.[2]


Please make two corrections to the manuscript: (1) in
the Preface strike out everything from “As we know” in the
second sentence to “opponents’ views” in the third; in the
next sentence instead of “it seemed to us” write “it seemed
to the author”.

I think it might be rather dangerous to speak about
“opponents” in the very first
paragraph.[6]

(2) On page 44 cross out the footnote at tin end of Section
VI and in place of it write: “cf. V. Ilyin, Economic Studies,
St. Petersburg, 1899, p.
30”.[7]

Please acknowledge receipt of these corrections.

Thanks for Neue Zeit and the report of the committee.
Is it possible to obtain the missing numbers of N.Z. for
1897–98; we have Nos. 7-8 and 11–24; Nos. 1-6 and 9-10 are
missing. I should very much like to have a full set for
1897–98.

You write that you received my letter of
November 15[3]

and did not receive the previous one about books. I no
longer remember exactly when I sent it, but I know for sure
that immediately after I received books from St. Petersburg
I sent you an ordinary letter with a list of misprints that
distort the meaning and a request to distribute a few copies
among acquaintances, including another three for
Manyasha (in addition to one for herself), one to St. Petersburg,
not to the old man but to the Samaran, one to
Kokushka (I have not sent him one); and three for you,
three for the Chicagoan, the author of The Factory (T.-B.) and
Markets
 (Bulgakov),[8] two for Grigoryev and Columbus
—I make it fourteen copies about which I wrote, as I
remember, in the lost letter.

I was very surprised to learn from the doctor that the
censor seems to have banned the translation of the Webbs’

    

book finally and unconditionally. How can that be? I am
of the opinion that it is a rumour—due to the translation
History of Trade Unionism, which is more
zensurwidriges.[4]


 Our translation is still in the press, isn’t it?

All the best,


V. U.

I wrote to the Statistics Department of the Zemstvo
Board of Tver Gubernia asking them to send me their
summaries (Vol. XIII, Issue 1, 1897). They have not sent it,
canaille. Is there anyone of your acquaintance who could
get it? Krasnoperov (if he is there) would surely not refuse.

 
Notes
 

[1]
I have counted about 900 letters to a page (and about 1,600
letters in those long pages that have been used for Chapter II).—Lenin

[2]
Figures followed by decimal fractions should be printed in a
special manner; the fractions should be printed in smaller type than
the whole numbers and should be printed below the line, i.e., not 6.3
but 6.3. This is very important in order to prevent mistakes.
—Lenin

[3]
See Letter No. 60.—Ed.

[4]
Contrary to the censor (Ger.).—Ed.
 



[5]
The trip was sanctioned and Lenin and Krupskaya stayed in
Minusinsk from December 24,1898 to January 2, 1899. They took
part in a meeting of Marxist exiles, who came from various parts
of Minusinsk District.





[6]
These corrections were never made to the Preface of The
Development of Capitalism in Russia.





[7]
The forty-fourth page of the manuscript (the fair copy) coincided
with page 20 of the first edition of The Development of
Capitalism in Russia (Collected Works, Vol. 3, p. 58). The correction
indicated by Lenin was not made to the first or the second
editions.





[8]
The writers referred to are M.  I.  Tugan-Baranovsky, author of
The Russian Factory,   Past   and  Present, and   S. N.   Bulgakov,

December 20 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

Today Volodya has unexpectedly gone out shooting so I
am writing. Recently the frost here has been as much as
20° below zero, but today it is only two and a half degrees
below and Volodya was tempted to go out with his gun,
especially as the Shushenskoye sportsmen have a theory
that this is the best time to go after grouse; the birds have
not eaten during the heavy frosts and are now so busy eating
that they do not see a man approaching. Volodya has taken
somebody else’s gun because he has broken his own; the
barrel proved to be made of cast iron and cracked merely
from being dropped on the ice. We sent the gun to
Minusinsk but the gunsmith there refused to repair it. And so we
shall have to buy another. We have heard that a very good
double-barreled gun is for sale in Minusinsk and Volodya
is thinking of acquiring it.

We are now busy preparing for a trip to Minusinsk.
Actually our preparations boil down to Volodya pinning a
sheet of paper to the wall and writing down everything we
have to buy in town. Mother is not going with us—first she
said “no” because the road was bad, and now she says it is
too cold. We are going on Christmas Eve and shall return
on the first or second, so Volodya’s next letter will be from
Minusinsk. I do not know whether Volodya told you that
Kurnatovsky and the Lepeshinskys are coming to Minusinsk
for Christmas, and that they intend to skate, play chess, sing,
argue, etc. It looks as though we shall have a good time.

When the “markets” are finished there is a plan to settle
down to the study of languages in general and German in
particular. Volodya is ordering Pavlovsky’s
Russian-German Dictionary from the warehouse and asks Anyuta to
get hold of Turgenev in German and a decent German grammar.

    

I have heard that one of the best German grammars
is that of F. Fiedler but I do not know for sure.

Oh, by the way, we suspect that our surmise
about
Zhizn[2] was incorrect. If so, it is not, of course, worth
while subscribing to it.

We have received only one letter from Manyasha. Why
doesn’t she write? Perhaps her letters do not reach us—she
should register them. Volodya has come home and is making
a fuss about my staying indoors and not going skating. So I
shall close now. “Happy New Year!” Kisses for you and
Anyuta, regards to D.I. and
M.T.[1]

Mother sends best
regards to all. There is nothing to write about at the moment,
but there may be after Minusinsk. Again, kisses,

Yours,

Nadya

I add my New Year’s greetings.

With regard to the translation of Turgenev—I should
think it would be best to enquire at Wolfe’s and at the same
time to get a catalogue of
Reclam[3] editions. It does not
matter to us which of Turgenev’s books you get, the only
thing is that the translation must be a good one. We should
like a German grammar that is as complete as possible,
especially as regards syntax. It would probably be better
if it were in German. Perhaps we should go over to Wolfe
altogether for ordering books and for information.
Kalmykova’s warehouse is not very forthcoming with
information; I asked them to get me a reprint of N. Karyshev’s
article “Material on the Russian National Economy” from
the Second Issue of the second part of Izvestiya
Moskovskogo selskokhozyaistvennogo instituta for 1898, but they
refused to fulfil my request or even send me the address
of Izvestiya. Can you get it?

All the best,


V. U.

in St. Petersburg from 1897 to 1901. In April 1902 the publication
of the journal was again started abroad by the Social-Democratic
group Zhizn (V. D. Bonch-Bruyevieh, V. A. Posse, V. M.
Velichkina, G. A. and M. A. Kuklin, and others).

The group ceased to exist in December 1902 and the publishing
office was closed down.

several thousand  booklets  on   literature  (Universal Bibliothek)
at   20  pfennigs each.

Mlle M. Oulianoff,


Rue des Minimes, 40,


Bruxelles,


Belgique

December 22, 1898

I have received Kovalevsky’s book from you, Manyasha,
but not a single letter. This surprises me (and all of us);
since that first letter from you we have not had another.
Are letters being lost? Or, perhaps, you are so full of your
new life that no time is left for-letters? I have had
Kovalevsky’s book for a long time; I got it in November, when
I ordered it from a Petersburg shop; I started reading it
but, I must admit, did not finish it—it is a boring
compilation. Write and tell us when you think of coming for the
summer, what newspapers and journals you are reading,
and whether you have got to know Brussels properly and
the publishing business there. Send me Journal
officiel,[3]
when it contains interesting parliamentary speeches. I
intend writing you a long letter after Christmas, to celebrate
which we are going to Minusinsk in a few days.

Yours,

V. U.

Nadya sends regards.

I received your letter of
December 20.[1]

I am now in
Minusinsk. I will reply on return.

Yours,

V. U.

Minusinsk, December 28, 1898

I am writing to you, Mother dearest, from Minusinsk;
Nadya and I are here for Christmas and will remain until
the first. We are having an excellent time here. This is
just the kind of holiday from work that we needed. Among
other things we skate very strenuously, sing, and so on.

Yours,

V. U.

I am writing to Anna separately.

Yesterday I got a letter from Manyasha with her new
address in Brussels.

Anyuta,

I have received your postcard of December 5 and your
letter of December 8. Thanks for them. I read a detailed
account of the écrivain’slecture in Russkiye Vedomosti.
Of course, it was hardly worth while putting forward such
new views in a short lecture. The remains of Fedoseyev’s
work would be interesting in this respect; I think he held
very different views on landowners’ farms before
the 
 reform.[3]

(I do not remember whether I informed you that we have
received N.Z. up to No. 24 inclusive.)

With regard to Pamyatnaya knizhka Tulskoi gubernii, I
wrote that it was for A. Sklyarenko whose address I did not
have at the time. I informed you a long time ago that I had
received the report of the literacy
committee.[1]


I am in agreement with the writer’s advice (to send it
to the printer immediately, use the same format and type
as Tugan-Baranovsky’s
book[4] and not send the proofs

    

here). The type used in that book will be compact enough;
it will come to about 500 pages. I have finished another two
chapters (V and VI) and chapter five has been rewritten. I
hope to finish in January.

Of course, I agree to entrust the second proofs to you
and shall be very, very grateful to you for this strenuous
and thankless work. I nevertheless think a professional
proof-reader is indispensable; in my opinion two rubles a
printer’s signature is too little—pay him three rubles or
more per signature for the reading of two proofs and take
the third (not the second) proof yourself. For misprints
send them to me (not one signature but 5-10 at a time). I
do not think, however, that it will be very convenient for
me to send you the rough copy; I sometimes need to make
additions, inserts, etc., and I cannot do this without the
rough copy. Could you not pay the proof-reader more and
have him send the pages of the fair copy with the proofs?
If that is impossible I will, of course, send the rough copy
(you can demand it by telegram “send rough copy”).

Yours,

V. U.

I answered immediately on receipt of your letter
regarding my consent to Vodovozova’s
terms.[2]

Blos is being
read and you are asked not to take it away. Can you not
get it in Moscow?

The lecture referred to was “The Basic Features in the
Development of Russian Serf Economy from the Beginning of the 19th
Century to 1881”, delivered by P. B. Strove on December 7, 1898
at the Moscow Jurists’ Society. A report of the lecture was
published in Russkiye Vedomosti on December 9,  1898.

N. Y. Fedoseyev’s views on the causes of the collapse of
serfdom can be assessed only from an article entitled “Historical
Information”, published in the newspaper Samarsky Vestnik,
January 16 and 17, 1897, and a letter to Andreyevsky headed
“Where Did the Russian Working Class Come From and How?”
No basic work by N. Y. Fedoseyev on the subject has yet been
found.

Causes and Their Effect on the Life of the People).

January 3, 1899

Nadya and I returned from Minusinsk yesterday, Mother
dearest, where we had spent a week with Gleb and Basil
very pleasantly and saw the New Year in among com-
rades.[2] There were many toasts on New Year’s eve but the
one most heartily greeted was that proposed by one of the
comrades “to Elvira Ernestovna and absent mothers”.

Today we have not been able to get back into our routine,
but tomorrow we shall set to work again. Chapter VI of my
book is finished (but not yet rewritten); in a month or so
I shall finish the book altogether. I answered Anyuta’s
letters of December 5 and 8 while still in
Minusinsk[1]

;

I
wrote to her that I agreed to the immediate despatch of the
first chapters to the printer, to having the proofs corrected
without the author (it is desirable to have three and not
two proofs) and the despatch of the final (clean) copy only
to the author and, in general, that Anyuta should take
charge of publication and do as she thinks fit. I hope Anyuta
received my letter. At the same time I sent a letter to Mitya
asking him to buy me a gun. Will it cause any difficulties
of a financial nature? Something seems to have gone amiss
with my fees and I keep ordering books from Kalmykova’s
warehouse, so I am beginning to have twinges of conscience.

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Y. V. and Nadya ask me to convey their regards.

January 10, 1899

Your letter and Anyuta’s, sent on December 24, I have
received, Mother dearest. As Nadya will write in detail,
there has been a hitch with the
parcel.[1]


You write that my letter of the
6th[2]

arrived on the 22nd
and that such a delay seems strange to you. I do not know
the reason. Perhaps the letter was late in leaving Minusinsk;
sixteen days is not long, seeing that we receive newspapers
from Moscow on the thirteenth day.

With regard to the proofs of the “markets”, I have to
admit that the writer’s statement that the manuscript is
exemplary does not appease me; the writer has on one
occasion shown himself to be a poor proof-reader and, in
general, it is not his business and not within his capacity to
handle such tedious work properly. I think, therefore,
that it will be necessary to insist on three proofs and not
two (the last to go to Moscow), and on Anyuta being in direct
contact with the proof-reader. I am afraid of its being
published as badly as the Studies—that would be very sad.
In general it is very difficult, impossible even, to give
you answers to all minor and partial questions from here;
they must be settled there, on the spot. I am not, therefore,
quibbling over the change of the title, even though I do not
like it, and the idea that it will “go” better with a broader
title is something else I do not like. I deliberately chose

    

a modest title. If, however, it is preserved as a sub-title
it is not so important and, I repeat, all minor questions
must be decided immediately on the spot. My answers from
here are always delayed and useless. If it is possible and
convenient I should like to have the last proofs, even if at
the rate of 5-10 signatures at a time.

I read in Russkiye Vedomosti about Tugan-Baranovsky’s
debate. Yes, he should have answered
Kablukov[3] more 
 sharply!

We shall soon be sending the fifth and sixth chapters;
there may possibly be a delay with the end, but it will not
be very great. I do not think it will hold matters up.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

I am sending an addendum to the second chapter, page
152 of the fair
copy.[4]

The debate was on the occasion of Tugan-Baranovsky’s
presentation of his thesis The Russian Factory, Past and Presentfor
the degree of Doctor of Political Economy at Moscow University
on December 19, 1898.

This addition to Chapter Two of Lenin’s book The Development
of Capitalism in Russia was apparently the footnote on the book

January 17, 1899

At last we have received the
parcel,[1] Mother dearest
Merci for it. On Tuesday we also received Neue Zeit from
Anyuta. It is most satisfactory that all last year’s issues
of Neue Zeit are gradually reaching us. Anyuta, of course,
has read Die historische Berechtigung, etc., in the issues
she sent me. I had read that article before this and am in
complete agreement with its arguments (as are other
comrades here). By this mail I am sending you two more
notebooks with parts of my book (Chapters V and VI) (+a
separate page—the table of contents); these two chapters
contain about 200,000 letters and the last two chapters will
contain approximately as many. I should like to know
whether they have begun to print the beginning, about how
much time it takes to set a signature and if Anyuta is reading
the last proof as she originally intended doing. If that is
the case I do not think there would be anything
inconvenient in sending the author the first few signatures together
with other books. However, the pros and cons of this have
probably already been considered without reference to my
opinion.

We have no news. Yuly has not written for a very long
time, which surprises and worries me. Anatoly is still
unwell, poor fellow; he recently went down with typhus and

    

there were some subsequent lung and heart complications.
We advise him to apply for a transfer to Minusinsk District
because the climate in Yeniseisk District is much worse,
but he will have his own way.[2]

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

The parcel was sent to Lenin by his mother, who later wrote to her
daughter Maria, “I sent a chess set for Volodya and some sweets
for Nadya to Shushenskoye on December 17, expecting that they
would receive them for the holidays, certainly for the New Year,
but they did not receive them until a month later, about January
17.”





[2]
A. A. Vaneyev applied to be transferred to a place with a milder
climate and the Governor-General of Irkutsk ordered him to be
sent to Tunka, in Irkutsk Gubernia. Only after a second request,
accompanied by a doctor’s certificate, did ho manage to get
transferred to Yermakovskoye in Minusinsk District at the beginning of
June 1899, where he died three and a half months later.

Mlle Marie Ouljanoff,


Rue des Minimes, 40,


Bruxelles,


Belgique

January 24, 1899

I have received the catalogues you sent, Manyasha. A
big merci for them. There are some interesting things in
them. I intend sending you a list of the books I should like
to acquire. Write and tell me if you have become familiar
with Brussels in general and with book publishing and
bookselling in particular. I should like to read the verbatim
reports of some interesting parliamentary discussions. In
Paris, for instance, they are to be found in the Journal
officiel, each issue of which can also be bought separately,
of course. I do not know whether it is obtainable in
Brussels. The Belgian government newspaper most probably
publishes similar reports too.

Where did you get the English catalogues? Are there
English bookshops in Brussels or did you order them from
London?

I am now busy with urgent work; there is not much left
for me to do to finish my book, and then I shall most likely
have to start contributing to the magazines. That is why I
am writing very little, especially as Nadya says that she
will write in detail about our life here.

If you come across anything in second-hand bookshops
on the economics of farming in France, Britain, etc.
(farming statistics, enquêtes, the reports of British commissions),

    

or on the history of industrial forms (among others,
Babbage, Ure—the older writers on this subject), please buy
them if the prices are moderate.

Have you much work? When are you thinking of coming
home?

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

January 26, 1899

I have received your letter about guns and hasten to
reply without awaiting the promised price list. I have the
price list of the gunsmith’s shop belonging to I.
Schönbruner (Stary Gazetny Street, between Tverskaya and
Nikitskaya Streets, in the house of Tolmachov), which Mark sent
me last winter. The most suitable on the list seem to me
to be the centre-fire guns by August Francott in Lüttich,
pp. 6-7 (45–55 rubles with a choke barrel—incidentally, is
it true that the choke increases the concentration of the
shot and the accuracy of the gun, as the price list claims
and as I have heard from sportsmen? If so, it must be a
very useful thing—12 and 16 calibre, weight about 7 1/2 lbs)
—and on page 22, a light gun by the same firm (6 1/2 lbs, and
a barrel of 14 1/2
vershki[1]

and not 17, also with a choke,
65 rubles for a
12 calibre).[2]

You ask about calibre and
weight. I have a 12 calibre gun and I have some cartridges
(brass) of that calibre left (made by Y. Torbek; I paid 12
kopeks each for them); this is the
size.[3]


However, you’ll probably have to buy new cartridges
(25, brass, will be enough, I think) because the cartridges
have to fit the gun exactly. And so you must choose the
calibre and weight yourself; it is not important, as long

    

as it has a good range (it goes without saying that, all other
things being equal, a light gun is preferable; perhaps it
really is better to have a heavier barrel, in case of necessity
it can be scoured, and it won’t break or buckle so easily.
I have been spoiled, you know, with my light plain-bore
gun!). I was particularly interested in the terms
Schönbruner offers; “selection of the gun is made by the purchaser
if he is present at the test, or by the shop” (p. 3), and not
a word about any special payment for a test! But you
should not leave it to the shop, of course, to make the
selection, you must test the gun yourself and measure the spread
of the
shot[4]

and take the test sheets. It is strange that they
should test it “at
50 arshins[5]

” (p. 3 N.B.)! What the devil
do they mean by that? What game can you shoot at a
distance of
17 sagenes?[6]

I always tested my gun at 25 to
30 sagenes. That, incidentally, may be due to my
inexperience. If you “hold a consultation” (oho!) all this will
probably be weighed up. I was extremely surprised to learn
that Schönbruner considers the weight of a gun for transport
purposes to be 35 pounds (sic! p. 108—“over long
distances”). That’s scandalous—17 rubles 50 kopeks! The gun
weighs 7 1/2 lbs which is 4 rubles and for the box (you write)
about 2 rubles, which comes to about 7 rubles, just as I
wrote to you and as I have been told in Minusinsk. Would
it not be better to order a box yourself and send it? A device
for filling cartridges, the simplest kind (I have one that
cost a ruble seventy-five kopeks; the thing for getting the
caps out is just a spike on a stick. In Schönbruner’s price
list, p. 75, fig. No. 133, the “ordinary local” kind are 1
ruble 75 kopeks). I do not need a game bag (when I kill
anything I bring it home on a bit of ordinary string!), I
have a cartridge pouch, a soldier’s (leather) cartridge box
that holds 12 cartridges, and the other 8 or 9 go in my
pocket; there is also a sling, although it would be better to fit
a ring for it in the shop, if it can be done. What do you mean
by “caps of a suitable calibre”? Caps are the same size for
all breech-loaders, aren’t they? I am marking out the size

    

of my caps at the
top[7]

;

if they are not the same size you had
better send about 500, of course, or even more; here only
the kind I have are available.

With regard to wads—I use ordinary newspaper and
thought buying them an unnecessary luxury. If I am wrong
in that (if wads are important for striking power) and if
they are really cheap (as you write), then send me either
some wads or an instrument for cutting them (in the price
list p. 92, 75 kopeks; I have heard that it is a very
convenient thing to have. Write and tell me whether you use
one and what sort of cardboard you use). There is no need
to buy a cover specially—I have a simple one, the old one
they gave me in the shop in Krasnoyarsk with the
gun.[8]

One of the comrades tells me that wire brushes are very
useful.

I think that is all. If there is a second-hand gun that
has been tested and has no defects in the barrel, of course
it is worth while taking it. Address the gun to Yelizaveta
Vasilyevna. There is no great hurry—it should be here
by March 1, and even the end of March will be all right.


I am very, very glad that your case is taking a turn for
the better, and that there are fresh hopes of getting into
the University. The mistake at the beginning of § II of
Chapter IV (p. 346) you did well to notice; thanks for that. It
should read 41.3 million
chetverts[12] and not
14.3.[9]

In my
first rough copy I had it right, in the second rough copy
I made a mistake and did not notice the absurdity. Please
send the correction immediately. With regard to the word
“rational” in the quotation from Kablukov, there is no
need to change it; there is no doubt that here Kablukov
means “reasonable” and not technically rational; I also
understood “rational” to mean “reasonable” and not
“technically rational”. I ridiculed him on this point because

    

his argument is pure tautology, since the Narodniks
consider natural economy to be “reasonable”. Should the
reader understand “rational” in the second case differently
from the first (i.e., different in Kablukov’s words than in
mine)?[10]


Tobacco plantations actually number 75—95—650
thousand(i.e., 75,000, 95,000,
650,000).[11]


Skating is something I do with the greatest of zeal. In
Minusinsk, Gleb showed me a number of tricks (he is a
good skater) and I have been practising them with such
industry that once I hurt my hand and could not write for
two days. My old skill has not been forgotten. This kind
of exercise is far better than winter shooting, when you
flounder up to your knees in snow, spoil your gun and
rarely see any game!

All the best,


V. U.

Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,


Vinogradov’s House,


Bronnitskaya Street,


Podolsk,


Moscow Gubernia

January 30, 1899

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received Neue Zeit from
Anyuta and a price list from Mitya. Merci for them. Today
I read an announcement about
Nachalo[1] in Russkiye
Vedomosti. It is a good thing I have managed to finish my
“markets” just in time for the beginning of Nachalo (I
finished them at long last today. On Wednesday I am
sending in the last two chapters) and now I shall be free to do a
little work on current affairs. I have received a little book
to review, but have not yet managed to read
it.[2]

I do not remember whether I wrote about Anatoly being
ill all the time. He has had another misfortune; an order
has arrived transferring him to the village of Antsiferovo
(several dozen versts to the north of Yeniseisk on the road
to
Turukhansk)[3]—further banishment to punish him
because an exile by the name of Makhnovets (who only
arrived this winter) ran away and gave somebody Anatoly’s
address. From this the conclusion was drawn in some
incomprehensible manner that Anatoly must have known
about the escape! So far Anatoly has not been moved
because of his illness—he cannot even go out of the house.
He has applied to be transferred to Minusinsk District or
to Russia for treatment.
 

Nothing has been heard about Yuly’s transfer.

Three exiles have also been transferred from the village
of Kazachinskoye (where A. A. Yakubova lives); those
transferred are Lengnik, to a place not far from us,
Arefyev and Rostkovsky, so the Kazachinskoye colony has
been very, very much thinned out.

Kurnatovsky (he lives in the village of Kuraginskoye,
some 100 versts away from us) asked to be transferred to
Shusha; he has been refused; he is now being transferred
to the village of Yermakovskoye (about 40 versts from
Shushenskoye), where he will be quite alone.

We are having exceptionally good weather; very light
frosts (10–12°), bright days and sunshine that is already
springlike. This is not a Siberian winter!

Many, many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Nachalo (The Beginning)—a monthly scientific, literary and
political magazine, organ of the “legal Marxists”; it appeared
in St. Petersburg in the first half of 1899, edited by P. B. Struve,
M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky and others. It carried several of Lenin’s
book reviews and the first six sections of Chapter III of his The
Development of Capitalism in Russia.





[2]
As can be seen from the next letter, this refers to R. Gvozdyov’s
book Kulak Usury, Its Social and Economic Significance; Lenin’s
review of the book was published in Nachalo No. 3 for 1899.
(See Collected Works, Vol. 4,  pp. 67–69.)

A. A. Vaneyev was not  transferred to the village of Antsiferovo
because of ill health.

February 3, 1899

Today, Mother dearest, I am sending you the last two
parts of my “markets”, Chapters VII and VIII, and two
Appendices (II and
III)[2] and the headings of the last
two chapters. At last I have finished a work that at one
time had threatened to drag on infinitely. I would ask
Anyuta to send them on to the writer as soon as possible
together with the enclosed review of Gvozdyov’s book. The
writer sent me the book “for review” and I thought it would
be awkward to refuse from here. But I did not enjoy writing
the review. I did not like the book—nothing new,
generalities, an impossible style in places (he writes about
“connivances at farming” and things like that). He is at the same
time a supporter and an opponent of the Narodniks and,
most important of all, a Nachalo collaborator. Little as
I like that “Samara”
spirit,[1]

I nevertheless decided to
restrain myself and fill up four-fifths of the review with
remarks against the Narodniks and one-fifth against
Gvozdyov. I do not know whether the editors will like it; I do not
know their relations with the “Samarans”. Nadya is writing
to the écrivain’s wife about all this today.

Many kisses for you and best regards to all.

February 7, 1899

Today I am sending you, Mother dearest, another small
package (registered)—first, the issue of
Izvestiya[2] I was
asked to return and, second, a
review[3] that I ask you to
pass on to the writer. By the next post I will send a little
addition to Chapter VII. I hope it will not be too late.
I think I forgot to write last time that according to my
rough calculation the whole book contains about 934,000
letters. This is not very much, altogether something like
467 printed pages, counting 2,000 letters to a page. If,
however, there are fewer letters to the page, for instance
1,680 (as in Tugan-Baranovsky’s Crises)—which, of course,
would make the edition unnecessarily expensive—there will
be about 530 pages.

Anyuta apparently did not receive the letter (written
a very long time ago) in which I asked her to send me (1) a
decent German translation of Turgenev and (2) a detailed
German grammar (even one in German for Germans, because
those for Russians are usually very
brief).[1]

I want to make a
real study of German. Now I ask you to send me a
Russian-German Dictionary, one of those we have at home,
Lenström, or better, Reiff’s dictionary of Russian and three
European languages. I wanted to order Pavlovsky’s

    

Russian-German Dictionary from Kalmykova’s, but
it is being issued in parts and only half of it has
appeared.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

February 13, 1899

Anyuta,

I have received your letter of January 27 and am
delighted with the news about the “markets”. If my letter of
January 10 was, as you say, too pessimistic, this one will
probably be far too optimistic. I am very grateful to
V.A., Mitya and especially you for the trouble you have
taken with the book, about the fate of which—as far as
a satisfactory edition is concerned—I am now quite
reassured. With regard to the title—I am inclined to agree
that mine is too long; it is, true enough, a necessary one,
but it would be better as a sub-title. The title itself
should be more modest than The Development of Capitalism
in Russia, which is too bold, too broad and promises too
much. On the Problem of the Development of Capitalism
in Russia would, in my opinion, be better. I did not receive
Ribot’s booklet (Affektivnaya pamyaf) which you say
you
sent.[4] There seems to have been a delay, either
in your sending the registered packet or in the delivery
here.

I wrote in an earlier letter about the approximate number
of letters in the entire composition, so it should be easier
for you to calculate how many more pages there will be.
I am anxiously awaiting the first two
chapters—typographically the second is the most difficult. You did well to
convince V. A. not to make changes “according to sense”
(incidentally, with regard to the little illustration you were

    

quite right—that is indeed what I meant to say, little
and not nice. As regards sharpness of tone, I am now in
favour of toning down such passages and decreasing their
number. I have realised that they are much stronger in
print than in speech or in a letter, so one must be more
moderate in this respect). I am also very, very pleased with
the tables, with your having convinced the printer not to
omit decimal fractions but to print them below the level of the
whole numbers and in a different type and not to print the
tables sideways. Even if it makes the publication somewhat
dearer, it does not matter very much. Judging from your
approximate estimate of the cost, you will probably be able
to fix the price at no more than 2 rubles 50 kopeks for an
edition of 2,400
copies.[1]

With regard to all that, however,
I leave it entirely to you to decide. It will also be
interesting to see how well the diagram comes
out.[5] What do the
statisticians say about it (V.A. and the
other[2]

)?

Several
remarks have been made to me about its being unusual.
Does it serve its purpose of being clear and convincing?

The
publisher[3]

wrote to me about the “Heritage”;
there is a certain grain of truth in his
remarks.[6] As far
as the Samarans are concerned, I doubt very much whether
they have said anything sensible (I have already had a
letter about the accusation of “bourgeois
sympathies”).[7]
The question of “from whom we received the inheritance”
is not the one I posed in my reply to Mikhailovsky—do we
renounce that heritage “that Moskovskiye Vedomosti attacks”
and which I gave an exact definition
of?[8] If polemics were
to be started against the Samarans on the fundamental
question of the attitude of Marxism to the liberal-enlightener
trends, and of the role and significance of the
“extra-economic”, it would be very interesting and useful.

All the best to you, Mark and Mitya, and many kisses
for Mother.

V. U.
 

Today Mikhail Alexandrovich (Silvin) passed through
here. He has been transferred to the village of
Yermakovskoye (some 40 versts from us). He seems quite well,
physically and mentally; he has changed little; we were very
glad to see him.

I am sending you yet another addition to Chapter
VII.[9]


I am surprised that O. Popova is taking so long in
settling up for
Webb.[10] Nadya said that the terms were to
pay the translator in any case, even if the censor banned
publication of the book. Our finances are again at rock
bottom. Please send 200 rubles to Y.V.’s address. If there
is still nothing from O. Popova and nothing is expected
for a week or two, I would ask you to borrow the money;
otherwise we shall be in trouble.

 
Notes

To make the book cheaper for the public it would be a good
thing to sell it for cash from the office of the journal, etc., with a
discount—for 1 ruble 75 kopeks, say. I do not know whether it can
be done.—Lenin

[2]
It is not known who the other statistician was.—Ed.

[4]
It can be seen from the next letter that Lenin’s sister Anna sent
him the pamphlet as a sample of the type in which his The
Development of Capitalism in Russia was being set.

[5]
Lenin refers here to the “Chart Illustrating Tables A and B”
in Chapter II of The Development of Capitalism in Russia (see
Collected Works, Vol. 3, between pp. 136 and 137).

Letter No. 76 __PROGRESS_COMMENT_





[6]
A. N. Potresov sent his criticism of the article “The Heritage We
Renounce” in a letter to Lenin; he said, in particular, that the
article produced the impression that the author proposed accepting
the heritage of Skaldin. Lenin agreed in part with Potresov’s
criticism but wrote in reply that he nowhere proposed accepting
Skaldin’s heritage and had used his name and not that of
Chernyshevsky and his followers for reasons of censorship (see Collected
Works, Vol. 34, pp. 28–29).





[7]
This accusation was made by one of the “Samarans” (see Note
40),    P. P. Maslov, in an article entitled “Idealizatsiya naturalnogo
khozyaistva” published in Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 3 for 1899.
Lenin seems to have been informed by Y. O. Martov about this
article.





[8]
Here Lenin refers to Chapter V of his article “The Heritage We
Renounce”  (see Collected Works, Vol.  2,  pp.  491–534).

Letter No. 76 __PROGRESS_COMMENT_





[9]
It has not been established with any degree of accuracy which
addendum to Chapter VII of The Development of Capitalism in
Russia Lenin was referring to. It is quite possible that he referred
to the footnote to the last paragraph but one of the chapter in
which Lenin stated that Marx’s classification of the capitalist
forms and stages of industry was more correct than that of Held
and Bücher, which confuses the manufactory with the factory
and regards working for a buyer-up as a special form of industry”
(see Collected Works, Vol. 3, p. 549).





[10]
This refers to the fee due to Lenin for his translation of  The His-

   

tory of Trade Unionism by  Sidney  and   Beatrice Webb.   The
book was published by O. N. Popova in 1899.

February 21, 1899

I am sending you another review, Mother dearest, and
ask you to send it on to the
writer.[2] I have never received
the Ribot booklet that Anyuta promised; I am surprised
at this and it is strange that Anyuta should single out
the page on which the type is supposed to be the same as
that used in the “markets”—page 24. Is Ribot’s book set
in different types? This book is of no importance to me
in itself, by the way, since I hope to get the first batch of
proofs soon.

We are all well here, there is no change, but we are
expecting visitors this
week.[1]

We are enjoying spring weather;
it has been thawing for several days.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to all.

Nauchnoye Obozreniye for some reason do not think it
necessary to send me either the first issue of the journal
or reprints of my article. I have heard about P. Struve’s
objection but have not yet seen
it.[3]

Torgovopromyshlennaya Rossiya. Spravochnaya kniga dlya kuptsov i

Lenin here refers to his article “A Note on the Question of the

1899 (see Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 55–64). Struve’s article in
reply to it, “Markets Under Capitalist Production (Apropos
of Bulgakov’s Book and Ilyin’s Article)”, appeared in the same
issue of the journal.

The market theory gave rise to a lively polemic in which A.
Izgoyev, P. Nezhdanov, B. Avilov and P. Skvortsov also
participated. In No. 8 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye Lenin published another
article, “Once More on the Theory of Realisation” (see Collected
Works, Vol. 4, pp. 74–93). Struve delayed publication of this
article, apparently in order to print his “Answer to Ilyin” in the
same issue. The polemics on this problem continued—Zhizn
No. 12 for 1899 carried P. Nezhdanov’s article “The Polemics
over the Market Question” and Lenin’s “Reply to Mr. P.
Nezhdanov” (see Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 160–65).

February 28, 1899

Today we said “Good-bye” to our guests, Mother dearest;
the people from Minusinsk came here—Gleb, Basil, Z.P.,
local workers and others—and stayed here from Wednesday
till today (Sunday). We had an excellent time and are now
returning to our usual tasks. The Minusinsk people intend
asking permission to come here for the summer; conditions
are very bad in town in the summer. I do not know, however,
whether material circumstances may not keep them tied to
the town. If they can come here we shall be able to spend
an excellent summer. Elvira Ernestovna, Gleb tells us, is
ill all the time. A.M. did not come—she is acting as
district nurse in the village of Kuraginskoye.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V.U.

Are you planning how to spend the summer and what
are you thinking of doing?

Anyuta,

I have received the issues of Neue
Zeit;[2] merci for them
and for the agricultural
returns,[3] and also for the clean
proofs of “markets”. I was very much pleased with the
last. You must have had a lot of trouble with them, but as
a result there are practically no misprints. I have not found
any in the tables (although you write about them) and
those in the letterpress are a mere bagatelle. I think the
type is satisfactory. There will be about 30 printer’s
signatures (that is the maximum, there will probably be
fewer), just the number I counted on. The tables have been
set excellently. It is particularly good that the decimal
fractions stand out well and there are no tables printed

    

sideways.[1]

The tables set in 6 point (p. 46) and in 5 point
(p. 39) have come out very well—I could not wish for
anything
better.[4] The sub-titles and the numbers of the sections
are all set in suitable type. In short, on this occasion I
have no reason to regret that the author cannot read the
proofs. In one of my next letters I shall send you a short
list of my acquaintances to whom I should like you to send
the book directly from Russia. It would cost more to send
a lot of copies to me and for me to send them from here,
and it would be less convenient. I hope that by the time
you receive this letter you will have gone a long way
past the second chapter, which, from the proof-reader’s
point of view, is the most treacherous chapter. I shall
give the Preface a little more thought—perhaps I shall
send another, or perhaps the old one can
stay.[5]

I am adding a list of misprints to this letter.

I have received Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 1 with the article
by P.B. Struve against Ilyin only from the Minusinsk
people. I am thinking of answering it, although it seems to me
that P.B.’s article is more for than against me. I do not know
whether I can now write and quote from the “markets”,
i.e., will they be out in the first half of April? Write and
tell me what you think. (It is important for me to quote
in order to avoid
repetitions.)[6]

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

I am enclosing a letter to Mark.

I do not know whether it would be convenient to write
to him at your address or direct. (Administration of the
Moscow-Kursk Railway—is that
enough?)[7]

 

Notes
 

[1]
There are column headings printed sideways but they are not
in the least inconvenient. In exceptional circumstances, tables printed
sideways are not so bad, but those set in 5 point type and upright
are much better. It will be a good thing if the table on p. 504 can be
set in 5 point
type.[8]—Lenin
 



[2]
Die Neue Zeit journal published by the German
Social-Democratic  Party;   although   subscription   to it was permitted in
Russia it was frequently confiscated if addressed to a politically
unreliable person. For this reason Lenin referred to it in Russian
(Novoye Vremya). Lenin’s relatives had the journal sent to them in
Moscow, and sent it on to Lenin in Shushenskoye.

Letter No. 78 __PROGRESS_COMMENT_





[3]
Lenin refers here to one of the books of agricultural returns which
was published by the gubernia Zemstvos, and which he used in
writing his book The Development of Capitalism in Russia.


Letter No, 78 __PROGRESS_COMMENT_





[8]
Lenin  probably refers here to the table showing categories of
industries in Chapter V of his The Development of Capitalism
in Russia (see Collected Works, Vol. 3, p. 347). This table was
printed in the smallest available type, as Lenin requested.

Letter No. 78 __PROGRESS_COMMENT_





[4]
This refers to the table in the second section of Chapter II of The
Development of Capitalism in Russia (First Edition) on the
distribution of allotment land among the various groups of
householders and the table in the first section of that chapter
illustrating the ousting of the middle group of householders in the Dnieper
Uyezd of Taurida Gubernia (see Collected Works, Vol. 3, pp. 86
and 71).





[5]
Lenin added only a postscript to the Preface of his book (Collected
Works, Vol. 3, pp. 26–27); he mentions this in Letter No. 82.





[6]
Lenin here refers to his article “Once More on the Theory of
Realisation”, in which he does not quote The Development of
Capitalism in Russia because he does not know when it will be
published; instead he quotes “A Characterisation of Economic
Romanticism”, published in the collection Economic Studies and Essays.





[7]
There follows, in the original, a list of the misprints. Some of
the corrections were made in the handwriting of Lenin’s sister Anna.

February 28, 1899 
 

Mark,

I received your letter of February 8. Your chess game
came in very handy. The people from Minusinsk were here
at the time as visitors and as they are now enthusiastic
chess players we had some exceedingly tough battles. We
analysed your game, too. Judging by that, you have begun
to play much better. You must have given much thought
to each move and (perhaps?) consulted your neighbours.
Otherwise, you know, I shall now be afraid to play against
a man who has defeated
Lasker![2]

With regard to the “forces of the true believers” arrayed
against me for my article on the
“heritage”[3]—I await
with interest something in the press about this. The
fundamental question of “support” is, in my opinion, a very
important one (in connection with the question of
“economics” and extra-economic relations. By the way, do the
forces connect the two issues?). It would be very useful
and very interesting to talk on this subject to people who
do not limit themselves to Gvozdyov’s theories (have you
read his book about kulaks? I think it is very, very
weak[1]

).

We shall wait a while.

I read your remarks on the “markets” with great interest.
We shall see what sort of impression they produce as a
whole—what the critics say, especially those who are to
our way of thinking. It is now impossible to correct the

    

book (except in individual passages, of course), that is,
it is impossible to change its general character, its laconic
style (as it is there are about 500 pages! More would be
absolutely impossible!)—masses of figures, tables, etc.,
and a narrow subject. Only one correction would have
been possible here—to divide the book into two parts or
two volumes and spend a year or two on reworking each of
them. For various reasons I found this plan not very
suitable. The question of foreign markets is touched upon
in general terms only in Chapter VIII, in one § and in
connection with the problem of the border regions of Russia.
In general I had to reject the examination of the foreign
market completely.

I have not heard anything at all about your plans to
leave your job. Which school of engineering do you think
of entering? A higher school? How many years is the course
and what rights does the diploma give you? Are you
thinking of becoming an engineer-technologist? Will you be
excused a year or two, i.e., not have to take the first part
of the course, since you are a graduate of a mathematical
faculty?

All the best,


V. U.

Regards from Nadya and Y.V.

[2]
Mark Yelizarov won a game of chess against the German chess
player Emanuel Lasker during a session of simultaneous play
on several boards. Lasker was in Moscow at the end of January
and in early February 1899.





[3]
By “true believers” Lenin apparently means the “Samarans”
(see Notes 40 and 140).

March 7, 1899

This week, Mother dearest, I have received three little
books by Turgenev in German. Merci for them. I am glad
you got the Reclam edition—I think it is the most
convenient. I am now waiting for a dictionary from Russian into
German (I remember we had two—Lenström and Reiff, an
old dictionary from Russian. The latter would be better,
although the first of them is quite all right), and also some
sort of a grammar. I wrote about this to Anyuta; Mark has
a Book about Books in which several detailed German
grammars written in the German language are listed. I wanted
to order Pavlovsky’s Russo-German Dictionary from
Kalmykova but it seems that it is not finished and is being
published piecemeal.

I am now finishing an
article[3] in reply to
Struve.[2]

It seems to me he has got things badly mixed up and his
article may cause a good deal of misunderstanding among
supporters and malicious glee among opponents. If it is not
possible to place the reply in the journal (for the simple
reason that Tugan-Baranovsky or Bulgakov will get their
answers in first; I still have not had the January issue of
Nauchnoye Obozreniye) I think I shall include it in the
“markets” as a fourth Appendix (the article is no more than

    

about sixteen pages). Of course it would be better in the
journal.

There are no changes here. The weather is warm. Spring
is already making itself felt.

There is little good news from the comrades. Apollinariya
Alexandrovna was allowed to go to Yeniseisk for three
weeks. Poor Anatoly is sick all the time, his temperature
goes up to 40° C. They say he has consumption—he is not
allowed to know this, of course. His transfer to Minusinsk
District has still not been settled.

Yours,

V. U.

Many kisses. Y.V. and Nadya send regards.

An envelope addressed to Lenin’s sister Maria in Brussels in

At this point Lenin’s mother added a note, apparently for her

Lenin’s article “Once More on the Theory of Realisation” was
written in reply to P. B. Struve’s “Markets Under Capitalist

Mlle Marie Ouljanoff,


Rue des Minimes, 40,


Bruxelles,


Belgique

March 7

Again I am guilty of great unpunctuality, dear Manya,
but do not be angry. Your letter came just before our
guests arrived. We resolved to celebrate Shrovetide in style
and invited everyone from the town (six
people).[1]

Our
quiet Shusha suddenly became crowded and noisy. We
spent the time in real holiday fashion and the five days
passed before we realised it. On the last day Mikhail
Alexandrovich also came (he is now our nearest neighbour
and we hope to see him often—he lives 35 versts from here).
After the visitors it took us all a long while to get back
to normal again. Volodya has immersed himself in an
article in reply to Struve. Still that eternally new question of
the markets. It looks as though Volodya will have to put in
quite a lot of time on polemics in defence of the postulates
made in his Studies. He intends to write about Kablukov,
too. I have no regular occupation, I just read. I have now
been ten whole months in Shusha and have not managed to
get anything done, I am always going to do something.
Spring is in the air. The ice on the river is covered with
water all the time and the sparrows in the willow trees are
chirping furiously; the bullocks low as they pass up and
down the street and the landlady’s hen under the stove

    

clucks so loudly in the morning that she wakes everyone
up. The streets are muddy. Volodya is more and more
often thinking of his gun and waders, and Mother and I
are thinking of planting some flowers. From this
description you can get some idea of the way we pass our time
and will realise that there is not a great deal of material
here for letter-writing. Judging by your letter, your life
is the exact opposite of ours—there is life and movement
all round you. You seem to be entering into local life and
to be full of its interests. Thanks for the newspaper cuttings,
send some more. Your irritation at your lack of knowledge
of French only impresses upon us the pitiful knowledge of
languages that Volodya and I possess—his knowledge is
a little better, but mine is very poor. We have got hold
of Turgenev in German and intend to start translating from
Russian into German, but so far we have neither a
dictionary nor a grammar and, even if we had, it is hardly likely
we should study. Apparently we shall get to know languages
only when we go abroad and necessity forces us to study
them seriously. When are you thinking of coming home?
Will you have to take any examinations? Do you feel very
homesick in Brussels? Have you many friends?

Oh yes—did you know that Anatoly is very ill? The
doctors have diagnosed consumption and he has a high
temperature all the time. Kuba was given permission to go
to Yeniseisk for three weeks and she has gone there. She
writes rarely and only to clear her conscience, so I don’t
know how she is getting on—probably not too well. Zina
is still the same as usual, merry and vivacious. And so,
good-bye. Many kisses. All the best. Mother asks me to
kiss you. Write more often.

Yours,

Nadya

Best wishes, Manyasha, and I, too, thank you for the
cuttings. I have nothing to add to Nadya’s letter.

V. U.

March 17, 1899

Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter of
February 28. A very big merci for your photograph. I think
it came out quite well and I am all the more glad because
the one I have is rather old. It would be wonderful if you
could visit us in Shusha. In summer the journey is a
relatively easy one—by rail to Krasnoyarsk and then by
steamer to Minusinsk (at the beginning of May the steamers do
not usually go as far upstream as Minusinsk but in summer
they go further, sometimes, though rarely, even to Shusha).
Shusha is not a bad place to stay in summer. Gleb and
Basil are applying for permission to be transferred here for
the summer (summer in Minusinsk is very bad); I do not
know whether permission will be
given.[1]

Manyasha wrote
to us recently and we are writing to her today.

Y.V. received the money.

It is a good thing that Mitya intended going for a gun
soon after your letter. The shooting season here begins at
the end of March and we are already discussing plans for the
shoot.

Many kisses and congratulations for your name day. This
letter will probably arrive before the first of April.

Yours,

V. U.

Y.V. sends regards, Nadya will also write to you
today.[2]

 

Anyuta,

I have received the
Izvestiya[5]—a big merci for it—
and the clean
proofs.[3]

By and large I am very pleased with
them; the book is neatly printed, the tables are clear and
without misprints, and very few of the tables are printed
sideways. But I don’t know about the diagram, how did that
come out? I am sending you a list of the misprints in
signatures 4 to 11. A few of them (I have underlined them)
either make reading difficult or distort the meaning (these
are very few). Perhaps it will be convenient for you to do
this: in addition to the list of misprints at the end of the
book you put in a special sheet at the beginning (it should
be glued in) asking the reader to correct, before reading,
the most important misprints, of which these (the ones I have
underlined) are of significance, the remainder being given
at the end of the book. I believe this is sometimes
done.

Since it is no use hoping for any book to appear without
misprints, I can tell you (contrary to your expectations)
that I feel fully satisfied. As far as accuracy is concerned
the Studies will not compare at all with this publication;
there are few misprints and most of them are quite
unimportant.

As for the contents, do as you please; you may confine
it to the section headings or add the detailed contents
I have
compiled.[6]

I am sending a list of acquaintances to whom I would
like you to send the book when it comes out. Mitya will
have plenty to do sending off such a heap of packages! But
that is better than sending a lot here (three copies will be
enough for me).

I am also sending a Postscript to the Preface. If it is
not too late I should very much like to print it, so as to
make reference to Kautsky’s splendid
book.[7] Perhaps
it will be possible to set the Postscript, even if the Preface
has already been set. As soon as you receive this, write and

    

let me know whether it is possible and, in general, when
the end is expected.

V. A–ch has let himself in for a job! It must be very
difficult to read the proofs of such a book!

All the best, and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Columbus and the doctor have not written to me for a
long time.

Anyuta,

I have one other request to make of you. Perhaps you
will chance to be in St. Petersburg or will see the writer—
if so, please find out about the Webbs’ book. Why have they
not paid any fee for it all this time, for, according to Nadya,
it should have been paid irrespective of whether the book
appeared or not. We should get it out of O. Popova. We
are not writing to the writer about it because we think this
question cannot really be dealt with in writing. I tell you
only in case you see him
personally.[4]

Mlle Marie Ouljanoff,


Rue des Minimes, 40,


Bruxelles,


Belgique

March 17

My greetings will not arrive in time, dear Manya, they
will be late, but I nevertheless send you many, many kisses.
Thanks for the views of Brussels, although I do not want to
think of foreign countries too soon, I do not even want to
think about Russia. All I allow myself to think about is
the summer. In her last letter to us, M. Al. wrote that
she is coming to see us this summer with Anyuta, and today
in a letter to Podolsk I plunged into a description of the
charms of
Shusha.[1]

I even outlined a trip to Lake Perovo,
where we shall catch crucians and fry them. You see, the
Minusinsk crowd are asking to come to Shusha for the
summer, and we are thinking of acquiring a horse, so that it will
be easy to go everywhere. I have become quite a “patriot”
and can talk with great enthusiasm about the Yenisei, the
islands, the forest, etc. All the same I am sorry I am not
a man; I should wander around a lot more. Although I
should very much like to see you, I do not intend to tempt
you with Shusha, because, speaking impartially, Shusha is
a village like any other, and if I were asked today to choose
between a place to spend the summer—near Moscow or in
Shusha, I should choose the former.
 

Volodya is now greatly interested in Kautsky’s
 Agrarfrage and is writing a review of
it.[2]

So far I can only glance
at the book and lick my chops. In general, we have quite
a lot of books and the very abundance of them only makes
one conscious of how much there is to be read and how little
one reads. We are not yet receiving Nachalo, so far only
that boring Russkoye Bogatstvo.

However, I must stop. Mother sends you kisses and
congratulations. Volodya intends to write himself.

We received M. Al.’s photo in the last post. It is an
excellent likeness, isn’t it?

Many kisses,


Yours,


Nadya

March 17

I apologise, dear Manyasha, that this time, too, I am
writing very little, just adding my congratulations to
Nadya’s. The fact is that today a lot of letters have to be
written—to Turukhansk (the post goes once a
month),[3]
and then I have to send Anyuta a list of the misprints in
the clean proofs she sent me.

We have very little news. There is a lull in literary
activity—we keep waiting. Foreign newspapers write of events
in St. Petersburg and Finland (judging by Frankfurter
Zeitung) but what they write is inked over, so we know
very, very
little.[4]

All the best. Perhaps au revoir?

Yours,

V. U.

The event referred to was a student strike that took place in thirty
higher educational establishments in St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Odessa, Kiev, Kharkov, Riga, Tomsk and other towns.


The disturbances in Finland were caused by the suspension of
the Finnish Constitution on February 3 (15), 1899. Evidently
the censor inked over the reports of these events published in
Frankfurter Zeitung.

I am sending you a note (or a review) on Kautsky’s book,
Mother dearest; I would ask Anyuta to send it on. I have
not yet received the first issue of the
journal.[1]

We hope
to get it the day after tomorrow.

If Anyuta has not yet written anything to Manyasha
about German books, is she going to write? If Manyasha is
leaving soon, let her leave instructions at the post office
to send books on to some other address (a friend’s, etc.).
Perhaps Anyuta will also write to her about her own friends?
If possible I should like to obtain the missing issues of

Many kisses and regards to all.

April 4, 1899

I have received your letter and Mitya’s, Mother dearest.
There is no need for you to worry about a place to stay
in Shusha, there is plenty of room here. We had four
visitors staying with us at Shrovetide. If your health
permits we should be very, very glad to see you, so as not to
have to wait until my term is up (sometimes the term is
extended—although I hope mine will not be). Nadya is
writing in greater
detail,[1]

but as regards the season I must
make a correction to her letter; at the beginning of May
the water is still low—the steamer put us ashore half way.
It is no good travelling an extra hundred versts by road.
The best thing is to reach Krasnoyarsk at the end of May,
when you can easily go by boat as far as Minusinsk, and
from there it is only 55 versts. As a summer resort Shusha
is not much worse than any other, I think (if worse it is). It
is only a question of the journey.

There is no need for you to be worried about the gun.
I am used to it and am very
careful.[2]

Shooting is the
only form of amusement here, and some sort of
“loosening up exercise” is necessary because of my sedentary life.

Thank Mitya for the trouble he took over the gun (which
I have not yet received).
 

I read in Russkiye Vedomosti that Mark beat Chigorin!
So that’s what he’s like! I’ll have to cross swords with
him one day!

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

By the way, I almost forgot—some books will be sent to
you C.O.D. from Vyatka. They are for me; please ask Mitya
to make a list of them and send it to me.

April 4, 1899

Anyuta,

I have received Prakticheskaya Zhizn and Heyse’s German
Grammar. Many thanks for the latter, it is an excellent
book. I wrote you last time that I had received
Tsion.[5]

By the last post I sent a telegram to Petersburg in answer
to the following, which I received on March 26. “Proposed
price of book two rubles, author’s royalties about 1,500
rubles, wire consent Kalmykova’s
warehouse.”[3]

I gave
my consent—because I cannot, after all, haggle by
telegraph—and on the eve of publication! How can I hold it
up for that! Actually I am not much in favour of that
“consent”. I was rather surprised that they (who? I do not know,
there is no signature) should have done things in a
roundabout way and, instead of asking you as the person in
charge of the whole business, applied directly to me. I
now regret that I did not answer “Apply to Yelizarova in
Moscow, she is in charge of the affair.” That is how I
should have answered! Because 1,500 is very little for three
years’ work, it works out at 50 rubles a printer’s signature.
Furthermore, since the Studies are selling exceedingly well
there need be no worry about the “markets”. If that is the
case there is no reason for making the booksellers a present
of 30 per cent. One could, if the publisher were a more
practical man or woman, offer the booksellers half that
percentage and also sell the book through the Nachalo
office, which, it is to be hoped, would not refuse. By the

    

way, it is probably a waste of time writing all this now,
since the deed seems to have been done. Of course, we shall
have to make concessions on the fees because of the
cheapness of the book. Since it is not we, but other people, who
are publishing the book there is no sense in making special
claims. And so, all the preceding is merely platonic
contemplation and not “business” propositions.

I believe it most probable that even the list of misprints
in signatures 11 to 16 (I received them from you the day
before yesterday) will be too late, so I am sending it only
in case, and without making a fair
copy.[4]


I have at last received issue No. 1–2 of Nachalo from
comrades. (Please subscribe to it for us, if you have not
done so. I did a very foolish thing in again relying on the
écrivain. I hope I shall not be so silly in the future.) In
general, I liked it very much, but B. Avilov is rather weak,
more scathing than
sound.[6] Bulgakov simply made me
mad; such nonsense, such utter nonsense, and such eternal
professorial pretentiousness—what the devil is
this?![7] No
wonder Syn Otechestva has already praised him! We’ll see
how he finishes up. I am thinking of writing “about
Kautsky’s book and Bulgakov’s
article”.[8] I have given up
the plan to write about Kablukov, he is not worth a second
article. The écrivain, as usual, is silent, and we do not
expect any information on journal affairs from him although
we feel a considerable need for such information.

All the best,
V. U.

See Krupskaya’s Letter No. 15.—Ed. 
 —Lenin

[2]
A centre-fire gun is much safer than an ordinary one.—Lenin

[5]
Lenin apparently made use of the journal Prakticheskaya Zhizn
and I. Tsion’s book Nigilisty i nigilizm to send letters in
invisible ink.





[6]
The article referred to is B. Avilov’s “Novy opyt ’ekonomicheskoi
garmonii’   (N. Kablukov, Ob usloviyakh razvitiya krestyanskogo
khozyaistva v Rossii. M., 1899)”, published in Nachalo No. 1-2 for
1899.





[7]
Bulgakov’s article was “K voprosu o kapitalisticheskoi evolyutsii
zemledeliya”, published in Nachalo Nos.  1-2  and 3  for 1899.





[8]
Lenin made a critical analysis of the views of S. N. Bulgakov,
the “legal Marxist”, in two articles under the common title of
“Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr. Bulgakov’s
Article)”. They were intended for publication in Nachalo but
since that journal was banned they appeared in Nos. 1 and 2 of
Zhizn for 1900 (see Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 105–59).

The importance which Lenin attached to his articles against
Bulgakov can be seen from his letter to A. N. Potresov of April
27,1899 (Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 32–33), in which he expresses
an exceedingly negative opinion of Bulgakov’s revisionist
writings.

April 11, 1899

I received Mitya’s parcel on Tuesday, Mother dearest.
Send him a big merci for all his trouble. I am pleased with
the gun (the weather is bad at present; the usual spring
squalls—strong winds from across the Yenisei; so there has
been practically no shooting). A charge of
2 3/4 measures
seemed too big (the gun kicks) and so I have begun using
2 1/2 measures. I don’t understand how they could have used
3 in the shop! I have not yet been able to observe that
the left barrel is better than the right—probably because
I fired from too great a distance, 60 paces or so, about
30 sagenes.

If you come here bring some plain black tulle for
mosquito nets—I cannot go about here without a net. The
locality is rather swampy. And also, please bring me
another 200 wads for powder and for shot (similar to those
Mitya sent me. There are none to be had here, and they are
light and easily packed).

At Easter I intend to make a shooting trip to a much
better area.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

(Next Sunday there will be no post on account of Easter.
Then the ice on the Yenisei may begin to move—it usually
does soon after the twentieth of April. There may be some

    

interruption of our correspondence; but you should not
let that worry you. Last year, I believe, there was
practically no interruption.)

Anyuta,

I shall send to Mother’s address by the next post an
article on Kautsky and Bulgakov. Please send it on to the
writer with a request that he inform you immediately
whether the editors accept it. I believe it quite possible
that they may not do so, because the écrivain is probably
on Bulgakov’s side and may find polemics inconvenient,
especially sharp polemics. As far as possible I tried to
modify my tone but I was unable to speak coolly about that
disgustingly professorial and clumsy article, which strikes
a terribly dissonant note. I do not, of course, want to
restrict the editors’ right to make “corrections”, but there is
no need to write about this since it is understood, unless
the author makes specific provisos. If they do not accept
the article, inform me, please, as quickly as possible and
send the article, if you can, to Zhizn or Nauchnoye
Obozreniye [Mir Bozhy is hardly likely to accept it]. There
has been no information from the writer on literary
matters, and we do not hope for any. Meanwhile it is
devilishly inconvenient to write without constant and regular
communication. A long time ago, in January, I think, I
wrote them (or Nadya wrote) that I intended doing an
article about Kablukov; they did not inform me that they
had another
article.[1]

You hear nothing about reviews.
(The review of Kautsky’s book should be cancelled or sent
somewhere else in view of this article against Bulgakov.)
You never know what they have and what they have not.
It would be a very good thing, if it were possible, to start
a correspondence with the Chicagoan, who is in the know
and probably has fairly close connections, so that he could
answer all questions and in general keep you au courant
with journal affairs. I do not know whether this could be
done.
 

How am I to send manuscripts if you (and Mother)
go
away?[2] In any case, leave the post office an address to
which letters and parcels can be forwarded.

Oh, yes—in my article I have referred to my “markets”.
If the book does not come out by the time you send on the
manuscript, please cross out the footnotes containing such
references or write in the manuscript that they should be
taken
out.[3]

All the best,


V. U.

 
Notes
 

[1]
The letter has been lost.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin refers here to the proposed visit of his mother and sister
Anna to Shushenskoye.





[3]
The article “Capitalism in Agriculture” was published much
later (in January and February 1900), when The Development of
Capitalism in Russia had already appeared, so the references
were not crossed out.

May 1, 1899

On Tuesday, Mother dearest, I received Anyuta’s letter
of April 12 and on Friday I received my
book[1]

(3 copies)
and the manuscript of the translation. I am writing to
Anyuta separately.

This year spring has come particularly early. The trees
are breaking into leaf and the water in the river is rising
rapidly. The steamer could no doubt get as far as Minusinsk
already, but nobody can say definitely whether the high
water will last and for how long.

Mikhail Alexandrovich (Silvin) wrote me that his
fiancée wants to visit him at the end of May (not earlier than
the 23rd). Her name is Papperek (Olga Alexandrovna),
address, Yegoryevsk in Ryazan Gubernia (she teaches at a
secondary school there). If you decide to come, perhaps you
could set out together. In any case it will provide a
convenient opportunity to send things. Mikhail
Alexandrovich has asked her to call at Podolsk on the way, but you
must, of course, get in touch with her because there may
be circumstances that prevent her from doing so.
Yermakovskoye (where M.A. lives) is 40 versts from here, and the road
there from Minusinsk is through Shushenskoye.

Yours,

V. U.
 

Many kisses and regards to all.

How are you fixed up now? How are you feeling? When
are you expecting Manyasha?

May 1, 1899

Anyuta,

I have received your letter of April 12, my book and
the Webb translation (three registered packages).

I am very pleased with the appearance of the book. The
publication is excellent thanks to the great trouble you
took with the proofs. It goes without saying that you did
well to raise the price. It is quite enough that there will
be a 25 per cent discount for students. Have you sent the
book to all our acquaintances? I think you should take
a further fifteen or so copies as the author’s reserve; we shall
have to exchange them for various symposia, etc. I have
already written to you about the Studies and asked you
to obtain a few more copies (send me two copies, but there
is no hurry). I am very pleased with the title of the book;
the écrivain’s correction proved worth while. If royalties
arrive do not send them yet. (I am writing to Mother about
a good opportunity to send things here that will soon occur.)

I am willing to take the job of editing the Webb
translation. I shall edit it in conformity with my own translation
of the first volume. Since I have been given the job of
editing there is nothing else to wait for, and the first volume
should be sent to the press immediately, should it not?
Or will that again depend on P.B.’s “preparations”?

For the editing job the following are indispensable—

(1) the English original of Volume 2 (I have only Volume 1),

(2) the German translation of Volume 2 (K. Hugo, I have
only Volume 1 although Volume 2 has also been published).
If these books have not yet been sent, please write quickly
and tell them to send them immediately. I am afraid this
may also cause a delay. Is it not possible to give someone
the job of getting those books from them and sending them
to
me?[3]

I did not very much like P.B.’s sending my reply to him
on to Nauchnoye Obozreniye; is he trying to avoid polemics
in
Nachalo?[4] If he is, my article about Bulgakov will

    

obviously not be published. At last I have received
Nachalo—two issues, complete. By and large I liked it very much.
But Bulgakov’s article is outrageous. Kautsky he distorts
outright, and then there is that attack on
Zusammenbruch[5]
—it is an echo of Bernstein’s “criticism” [the warehouse
refused to send me Bernstein’s book; I have asked
Manyasha, but I do not know whether she will bring it. Can you
get it?] I am writing a second article against
him.[2]

Of
course, polemics among one’s own people are unpleasant
and I tried to tone the article down, but to keep quiet about
differences is not only unpleasant, it is downright harmful—
and, furthermore, one cannot keep quiet about the chief
differences between “orthodoxy” and “criticism” that have
come to the fore in German and Russian Marxism. Our
opponents are already taking advantage of the differences
anyway (Mikhailovsky in Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 4). While
polemising among ourselves we can agree on general solidarity
against the Narodniks. I want to do this at the end of my

article.[6] One of Bulgakov’s chief faults is that he did not
say exactly in what he agrees with Kautsky against the
Narodniks.

All the best,


V. U.

In Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 3 I saw a note by Maslov
against my article on the heritage. It seemed quite
uninteresting.

I am sending Negri. And what are these farming returns?

A copy of The Development of Capitalism in Russia should
be given to Maslov. Please do that through the Nauchnoye
Obozreniye office, or through P.B., or through V.A.

Please send all reviews of the book and ask V.A. to send
those from the St. Petersburg newspapers.

 
Notes
 

[1]
The Development of Capitalism in Russia.—Ed.

[2]
See Note 164.—Ed.
 



[3]
Lenin began editing the second volume of the Webbs’ Industrial
Democracy only at the beginning of September 1899. In the course
of this work he had not only to edit the translation but also to
retranslate a considerable part of the text and write a number of
footnotes. The work was finished on January 19, 1900.





[4]
P. B. Struve handed Lenin’s article “Once More on the Theory
of Realisation” over to Nauchnoye Obozreniye because of the
unstable position of Nachalo following the confiscation of the
April 1899 issue.





[5]
There was a remark in Bulgakov’s article “K voprosy o kapitalisti-

   

scheskoi evolyutsii zemledeliya” rejecting   the  Marxist  theory of
Zusammenbruch (socialist revolution).

Somewhat earlier Bernstein had made a similar criticism in
his Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der
Sozialdemokratie, 1899 (the English translation was entitled
Problems of Socialism).





[6]
No such remark was made at the end of the second part of
“Capitalism in Agriculture”. It is possible that Lenin spoke of this
in the first variant of his article; judging by Letters 98 and 99
he must have rewritten the article.

Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,


Vinogradov’s House,


Bronnitskaya Street,


Podolsk,


Moscow Gubernia

May 9, 1899

I have received a letter from Manyasha, Mother dearest,
in which she says she is thinking of coming home soon. I
shall await news of what you decide to do about coming
here.

For the last few days we have had what the Siberians
call strong “weather”—by “weather” they mean the wind
that blows from across the Yenisei, from the West; it is cold
and violent, like a whirlwind. In spring there are always
whirlwinds that tear down fences, roofs and so on. I was out
shooting in the pine grove and I actually saw huge birches
and pines being uprooted by a whirlwind. Such unpleasant
“weathers”, however, occur only in-spring and autumn, and
if there is a wind in summer it is not strong, so that should
not cause you any alarm. Today has been better—there
seems to be a turn towards summer. From mid-May to
mid-August there is no reason to beware of Siberian “weather”.

Next Sunday I am sending to your address the manuscript
of an article of
mine[1]

;

if you go away, arrange for it to
be forwarded to its destination.
 

We are all well and all of us send regards to you and
everybody.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

Anyuta,

Today I finished my second article against Bulgakov.
When I have corrected and rewritten it I will send it to
Mother’s address. I am anxiously awaiting a reply about
the first article; I should get it by the middle of May.

Many of the
“disciples”[2] are going over to Zhizn. Do
you know who is actually the editor of it?

There is a very interesting discussion going on now in
Germany over Bernstein’s book—and I have not seen that
book or anything written about it (with the exception of
some casual notes in Frankfurter Zeitung). A great pity.

Has Mitya sent my book to everybody on my list? If
V.A. was to send off some of them, please ask him if he
has sent them to everyone. P.N. Lepeshinsky (Kuraginskoye,
Minusinsk District, Yeniseisk Gubernia) wrote me, for
instance, that he had not received the book, although he was
on my list. I think you should have about fifteen reserve
copies (there is no need to send them here).

All the best,


V. U.

Regards to Mark.

May 29, 1899 
 

Anyuta,

I have received your postscript to Mark’s letter.

You had not previously written to me about a proposal
that I write a short course of political economy. I have
decided to refuse the offer; it is difficult to write to order
(in particular, it is difficult to compete with Bogdanov.
Why not republish his
book?[2]), and it would be difficult
to finish it by autumn. In general, I want to write less and
read more. Since my correspondence with the écrivain has
come to a complete halt, please let him know of my refusal.

I have not yet started on Webb. I am still waiting for the
original (of Volume 2) and the German translation (of
Volume 2). If there is a delay it will not be my fault. There
is more reason to fear a delay on the part of the écrivain,
incidentally. Is the first volume in the press?

I learnt that a telegram had been sent me about the
publication of the book only from your letter. I am writing
to the Minusinsk post office asking them to search for the
telegram. Was the address correct? You should write:
“Minusinsk, to Shushenskoye by post, Ulyanov”, and pay
seven or fourteen kopeks extra for postage. If you did not
add “by post”, it is possible that the telegram is still lying
there. In general, I have not noticed that the despatch
of telegrams to this place is a hopeless undertaking; others
have arrived in time. You should send them so that they
arrive in Minusinsk on. Sunday or Wednesday evening and
I will receive them on Tuesday or Friday morning.
 

I am sending the article on Sismondists that you asked
for and the reply to
Nezhdanov.[3] It would be most
convenient to print the latter in the same
Zhizn.[1]

If, however,
contrary to expectations Nachalo revives, I should prefer
it in that journal.

I am now doing some reading and studying languages a
little. In general I am doing very little work and do not
intend writing anything.

I am very sorry the écrivain did not write anything to
me about Gvozdyov. I wanted to curse him for all I was
worth, but I saw that he was a contributor to the same
journal and felt myself duty bound to be as gentle with him
as possible. It would have been strange to squabble in the
same journal. Perhaps the writer wanted to get rid of it—
get rid of the “Gvozdyov school”, as I now call these
things. I do not know this and, in general, I do not know
what sort of fellow Gvozdyov is. It is difficult to judge
from a distance.

Yours,

V. U.


May 30, 1899

I am sending you a registered package, Mother dearest,
containing my article and a reprint of the article on the
Sismondists that you asked for. I am writing in greater
detail to Anyuta and Mark, from whom I received a letter
this week. It was strange that their letter (dated May 14)
was postmarked “Krasnoyarsk”. Was it sent by the
Siberian express?

We here are all quite well and send regards to everybody.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.
 

Notes
 

[1]
If my answer to Struve has not yet been published, you might
perhaps add this to it as a postscript and throw out my mention of
a reply to
Struve.[4]—Lenin
 



[2]
This refers to A. Bogdanov’s Kratky kurs ekonomicheskoi nauki.





[3]
The articles referred to are   “A Characterisation of Economic
Romanticism. (Sismondi and Our Native Sismondists)” and “Reply
to Mr. P. Nezhdanov”, the latter having been published in the
December (No. 12)  1899 issue of Zhizn (see Collected Works,
Vol. 2, pp. 129–315, and Vol. 4, pp. 160–66).





[4]
Lenin refers to the following sentence from the first paragraph
of his article “Reply to Mr. P. Nezhdanov”: “As far as the-other
questions are concerned, those raised by Mr. P. Nezhdanov in
respect of the market theory and, in particular, of P. B. Struve’s
views, I shall confine myself to a reference to my article in reply
to Struve (’Once More on the Theory of Realisation’; the delay
in its publication in Nauchnoye Obozreniye was due to
circumstances over which the author had no control”) (see Collected Works,
Vol. 4, p. 160).

June 20, 1899

I have received your letter of May 31, Mother dearest.
Merci. With regard to the statistical returns—from Tver
and Vyatka—I think I have already written that there is no
need to send them all to me; I am not working on this now
and do not intend to until my term of exile is finished.
If any particular book is needed it will be better for me
to order it separately, otherwise I shall have a mountain
of books to bring back. But you are probably sending only
a few statistical returns. Mikhail Alexandrovich writes that
he does not expect his fiancée until the end of summer.

We do not think it worth while asking for a transfer to
Krasnoyarsk. We have been talking recently with
Yelizaveta Vasilyevna, who is thinking of asking for permission
for me to go with them to Ufa this autumn because of the
difficulty of a winter journey for her and Nadya. If she
carries out her intention I will let you know.

We have been paid our allowances.

We have news from Yermakovskoye that Anatoly is no
better.

We have also heard that Lyakhovsky has made a trip to
Chita as a doctor.

It is a pity you are having such bad weather and have
no opportunity for a good rest in the country. June has
been rainy here, too.

Life here goes on as usual. I am not working much at
present and soon, when the shooting season opens, I shall
probably work even less.
 

I have received the May issue of Nachalo—pretty badly
cut up. I do not think there is anything of particular
interest in it. I am losing all hope of that journal regaining
its health. I have had a letter telling me that the Ministry
of the Interior has demanded that the editors reveal the
names of the authors who wrote in the first and in the April
issues under pseudonyms. It would be interesting to know
whether we have any mutual acquaintances among the
“revealed”.

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Mitya,

I have seen Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 5 and find that
Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in it is monstrously foolish and
nonsensical; he has simply arbitrarily introduced changes
into the rate of surplus value in order to “refute” Marx;
he assumes an absurdity—a change in the productivity of
labour without a change in the value of the product. I
don’t know whether every such nonsensical article is worth
writing about. Let him first fulfil his promise to develop
it in
detail.[2] In general I am becoming a more and more
determined opponent of the latest “critical stream” in
Marxism and of neo-Kantianism (which has produced,
incidentally, the idea of separating sociological from economic
laws). The author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des

Materialismus[1]

is quite right in declaring that neo-Kantianism is a
reactionary theory of the reactionary bourgeoisie and in rebelling
against Bernstein. I am extremely interested in Bogdanov’s
new book (Osnovniye elementy istoricheskogo vozzreniya na,
prirodu, St. Petersburg, 1899) and have ordered it; the
review of it in the May issue of Nachalo was written
ridiculously, with pompous phrases but no mention of the real
problem. I am very sorry that I somehow missed the
advertisement of the book when it was published. I think it
should be a sensible book and that such a review should not
be left
unanswered.[3]
 

Am very pleased with the gun. We did not shoot much
in spring. Soon the real season will begin and I intend to
spend more time shooting this summer.

All the best,


V. U.

Please send me a list of the Zemstvo statistical returns
that have been sent to me—titles and brief contents, i.e.,
tables or tables+text, nothing else.

 
Notes
 

[1]
Essays on the History of Materialism by G. V. Plekhanov.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin mentioned Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in a footnote to the
last paragraph of his  article   “Uncritical Criticism”   (Collected
Works, Vol. 3, p. 632) and in a letter to A. N.   Potresov dated
June 27, 1899 (Collected Works, Vol. 34, p. 39).





[3]
The review was that by G-d of A. Bogdanov’s book Osnovniye
elementy istoricheskogo vzglyada na prirodu. It is not; known whether
Lenin wrote anything in reply to the review. From his letter
to Maxim Gorky, dated February 25, 1908 (Collected Works, Vol.
13, p. 448) we know that he had the book in Siberia.

It is known from a letter to A. N. Potresov, dated June 27,1899,
that Lenin at that time assumed that A. Bogdanov was the
pseudonym of G. V. Plekhanov (see Collected Works, Vol. 34, p. 41).

I am writing a few lines, Mother dearest, to tell you
that we are all quite well. This week I received the books
Manyasha wrote to me about (Labriola and Jules Guesde).
Merci for them.

We have put off the journey to Minusinsk for a while.
Perhaps we shall go for a short time this week. The weather
here is rotten; it has been a bad summer, all wind and rain.

I have received a letter from Lyakhovsky; he has been
working as a doctor, it seems, in Chita and thinks of going
later to Sretensk, also as a doctor.

I still have not received the original of the Webbs’ book,
although the writer promised it.

Yours,

V. U.

August 1, 1899

I do not think there is very much news this week, Mother
dearest. The weather has changed to real summer, it is
very hot and rather interferes with shooting, which I am
indulging in very strenuously because it will probably be
over soon.

I do not remember whether I wrote about  the doctor
(Y. M. Lyakhovsky), that he has made a trip to Chita as a
doctor and intends to accept a similar post in Sretensk.

Visitors have arrived—M.A. with his wife and others.
Excuse me for cutting this letter short. We are all well
and send regards. I shall write to Anyuta soon about the
Credo (which interests and exasperates me and everybody
else) in
detail.[1]

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s detailed analysis of the Credo appears to have been sent
in a letter written in invisible ink.


Credo, or Creed, was the name under which the programme
or manifesto of the group of Economists, written by Y. D.
Kuskova, became known. It was sent to Lenin in Shushenskoye by
his sister Anna. Lenin’s sister later recalled that she had received
the Credo in St. Petersburg from A. M. Kalmykova and “in the
next letter in invisible ink to my brother, one of those written in
books and journals, added this composition, rewritten in
invisible ink.... I gave the document the first name that came into my
head and wrote ’I am sending you some “Credo of the young”.”’

After having received the Credo Lenin wrote “A Protest by
Russian Social-Democrats” which was discussed and adopted at
a meeting of seventeen Marxists exiled to Minusinsk District
(Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 167–82).

I have received your letter of July 15, Mother dearest.
A big merci for it and for carrying out my request in respect
of
Anatoly.[1]

I hope to see him again in a few days; they
say he is very bad, the blood is flowing from his throat
and he even coughs up pieces of lung.... The Governor was
in Yermakovskoye and gave Anatoly permission to go to
Krasnoyarsk, but now he himself does not want to go.

We are expecting visitors today—Gleb and his wife
and Basil from Minusinsk. It is said that Gleb has received
permission to move to the railway and take a job as
engineer. He will, of course, take advantage of the offer
to get together a little money for his journey home. It would
otherwise be rather difficult for him and Basil to get away
from here, even impossible in winter.

We have not put in any requests after all—it doesn’t
seem to matter, we shall wait for January 29,
1900....[2]

If only we can get away from here at that time—where we
shall be till then is not important.
 

E.E.’s health has improved. The Minusinsk people have
had a good summer. A.M. has obtained a job in Minusinsk,
I believe.

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Manyasha,

I recently read Stammler’s book here, in German, and
felt very dissatisfied with it. In my opinion it is learned
nonsense and fruitless scholasticism. It would be
interesting to know who praised it to you. It is true that Struve
and Bulgakov, both of whom, like Stammler, take a stand
on
neo-Kantianism,[4] praised it in Novoye Slovo. Stammler
in my opinion is an excellent argument against
neo-Kantianism. To attempt to fight Marxism armed with nothing but
foolishly compiled definitions in the way Stammler does
(he has never written anything but textbooks for students
of Roman Law...) is too absurd an undertaking. It was
correctly said in Neue Zeit (Cunow) that Stammler’s book
is of negative significance.

A few days ago I received the April issue of Nachalo
and read almost all of it. It is very interesting in general
and the article “Out of Turn” in particular.

Webb (the original) we have still not received! It seems
I shall have to postpone it till my return since I can get
nothing done.

I have read P.N. Skvortsov on markets in Nauchnoye
Obozreniye No.
7[5]—in my opinion the article contains
very little and the author’s point of view is not clear to
me. My reply to Struve has still not been
published[3]

—

the devil knows, this is disgraceful and muddleheaded!

All the best,


V. U.

The day before yesterday I received your letter, Mother
dearest, letters from Anyuta and Manyasha, a book from
Anyuta (Nauchnoye Obozreniye) and cuttings from
Manyasha. Merci for everything. I was terribly pleased to know
that you are up and about again. What caused the epidemic
of malaria in Podolsk? Is it a swampy place? Do you feel
quite well now? It looks like being a good autumn here,
dry and warm. What is it like where you are?

Letters sent by express train do not seem to come any
quicker than those sent by ordinary mail, which surprises
me very much. I received your letter of August 7 on the
20th (and on the same day I also received the newspaper
of the 7th). Is the delay not caused by the express train
taking letters to Krasnoyarsk (at any rate the envelope bears
the stamp “Krasnoyarsk 14.VIII”) and from there a letter goes
back to Achinsk (the post road is from Achinsk to Minusinsk)?
Either this train does not stop at Achinsk or the mail is not
taken off it there. That must be the reason, because letters
go quickly from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk (from 7th to 14th)
but the gain is lost on the way back from Krasnoyarsk to
Achinsk.
 

As far as the transfer is concerned, we only talked about
it but did not submit any applications. We do not think it
worth while applying—we will wait until January 29, 1900.

Life here goes on as usual. The weather is fine and Nadya
and I go walking a lot. We are all in good health.

I embrace you, Mother dearest, and hope you will keep
well.

Yours,

V. U.

August 22

I received your letter long ago, dear Manya, but I have
been terribly lazy lately and have got all behind with
my letter-writing; there are several letters I must answer.
It must be due to my present way of life; I spend whole
days (as much as five hours at a time) out walking,
somehow it is even difficult to read. The summer was foul, but
autumn so far has been marvellous. Volodya also does a
lot of walking, but he still does some work, although far less
than before.

What have you decided? When are you leaving and where
are you going? When I read your letter to Volodya in which
you asked him what institution you should enter, I
remembered what a quandary I was in at your age. First I decided
to become a village schoolmistress, but I was unable to
find a place and wanted to go to the provinces. Then when
the Bestuzhev courses were started I joined them, expecting
to be told about everything I was interested in, but when
they began to talk about something quite different I left.
In short, I was in a hopeless quandary. I was twenty-one
before I heard that there was such a thing as the “social
sciences”; up till then my idea of serious reading had been
either the natural sciences or history, and so first I would
try to read Rossmässler, then the history of Philip II of Spain.
You are placed in very different circumstances. Whether
it is worth while learning “how to make a living”, I don’t
know; I think it is not worth while. If money is needed
you can get a job on some railway, where at least you will
be able to work off the necessary number of hours and have

    

no cares, you will be as free as a bird; but all this pedagogy,
medicine and so on absorbs a person more than it should.
It is a pity to waste time on special training when there is
so much you want to know and should know, and, after all,
your knowledge of languages will always feed you.
Volodya and I are in trouble with languages; we both are rather
bad at them; we take a lot of trouble over them, but we
are still not good. We have taken up English again. How
often we have done so before! I am beginning for the tenth
time, at least. You are probably far ahead of me by now.
Anya knows English quite well, doesn’t she? But I keep
forgetting to ask you whether you have made the
acquaintance of Meshcheryakov? I believe he is in Moscow now.
He is as much in love with Belgium as you are. At one
time I corresponded with him, and I then had a good
knowledge of all Belgian affairs and was very interested in them.
If you see him, try to find out where his wife is. A friend
of hers wrote me that she had gone to Munich. I should
be sorry to lose touch with her. She is a very nice person.
I don’t know whether we shall ever meet again. All my
St. Petersburg acquaintances have been so scattered in
all directions that I don’t know who is where. At first
we wrote to one another, but now our correspondence is
gradually drying up. It is no good writing letters, you
can never really discuss anything, and you begin ... the
result is that before you know where you are a
misunderstanding arises. I do not know how Kuba is getting on,
she wrote little, but it looked as if her nerves were giving
out. But I have written so much there will be no space left
for Volodya, so I had better stop. Many kisses for you, Maria
Alexandrovna and Anyuta. Mother sends regards to all.

All the best,


Nadya

August 22, 1899

I was very pleased, Manyasha, when I read that at last
you had got Bernstein for
me;[2] I have been and still
am waiting very impatiently for it. People have written to
me from Yakutia that they are reading Bernstein and we

    

have not yet got it here! The more they shout about him,
and the more various thick-headed bourgeois and “young”
(in all respects) non-bourgeois make use of him, the more
necessary it is to make the speedy acquaintance of this
“newest” hero of opportunism.

On October 9, 1899 (N.S.) there will be a
Parteitag[1]

in Hanover and they will talk about
Bernstein.[3] I should
very much like to have reports of it. Please try to get them
for me; it is quite possible to do so in one of the following
ways. Write to your acquaintances abroad (I ask Anya to
do this, too) to send those issues of the newspapers in which
the reports are printed, even if it is only Frankfurter Zeitung,
which can enter Russia. If the acquaintances do not
undertake to send either
Vorwarts[4] or Frankfurter Zeitung,
perhaps you can subscribe to Frankfurter Zeitung for
October through the Moscow post office. (I know you can subscribe
for three months, but that is too long and too expensive,
4 rubles 70 kopeks. Perhaps you can subscribe for a month?)
If you are abroad yourself, then please buy those issues
and send them.

I am not sending you any literary jobs because I am
not writing anything now and do not intend to write. But
if you go abroad I shall probably ask you to look out for
some good old books for me.

All the best,


V. U.

The Hanover Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party
was held October 9-14, 1899. The report on the chief item on the
agenda—“The Attack on the Basic Views and Tactics of the Party”,
was delivered by August Bebel. Lenin wrote that this speech
against the opportunists would “long remain as a model of the
defence of Marxist views and of the struggle for the truly socialist
character of the workers’ party” (Collected Works, Vol. 19, p. 300).
Although the congress opposed Bernstein’s revisionist views, it did
not give an extensive criticism of Bernsteinism.

August 25, 1899

Last Sunday we returned home, Mother dearest, and got
a letter from Manyasha with newspaper cuttings (a big
merci for them), and then Neue Zeit from Anyuta and
reprints (2) of my articles against
Levitsky.[2] I was
particularly glad to receive them. Anyuta wrote that you are still
undecided whether to come here or not, and that you would
come if you were sure the boat would take you to Minusinsk
and back. When we read that, we decided to send you a
telegram saying that the boats run until the middle of
September (last year a boat took me as far as Minusinsk
after the twentieth—of course, it was the last), so you
would have time to come if you have fully regained your
health and Mitya’s case permits it. I hope you receive the
telegram sent on the 22nd in good time. In reply to it we
shall await either you in person or a letter. Up to now (for
two years) autumn here has been fine, but I don’t know what
it will be like this year after a rainy summer.

Of the books sent by Anyuta I am particularly glad to
have Mehring; I have just finished reading the second
volume and am very, very satisfied. As far as the Credo der

Jungen[1]

is concerned, I was amazed at the emptiness of
the phrases. It is not a Credo but a pitiful collection of
words! I intend to write in greater detail about it.


 


The writer’s silence is exasperating. He does not send
Webb. He does not publish articles about the “markets”,

    

and nothing has been seen or heard about the
anti-Bulgakov article. I think you should take back all the manuscripts
and send them in to editorial offices yourselves so as to get
precise and timely answers regarding whether they will be
published, and to have direct contact. It is, of course,
inconvenient for me to do it myself, but Anyuta could do it,
I think, if other affairs do not prevent her from giving her
time to it; it would be better to send them direct than to
send them through the writer. If he has held up my article
against him merely because he has not yet finished his
own answer to it—that is simply swinish on his part! It
is useless for me to write to him, because he does not answer.

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

The two articles mentioned, in which Lenin criticised the views
of the liberal Narodnik N. V. Levitsky, have not been found.
They were apparently intended for Nachalo. “About a Certain
Newspaper Article” is the only article known to have been written
by Lenin in the Siberian period about N. Levitsky’s “O nekotorykh

   

voprosakh, kasayushchikhsya narodnoi zhizni” (Certain Problems
Affecting the Life of the People) published in Russkiye Vedomosti
on August 30, 1897 (see Collected Works, Vol. 2, pp. 316–22).

September 1, 1899

I did not manage to write to you on Sunday, Mother
dearest, and am writing in the middle of the week.

Yesterday we received books by Bernstein and

Vandervelde[1]

and two issues of Moskovskiye Vedomosti—Bernstein
was wrapped in one of them—and half another issue (No. 223)
came in a separate packet, which surprised us more than a
little. Has something been lost, or has there been a
mistake?

As regards Bernstein—I have decided that I may
consider it mine; Manyasha did not say exactly that she wants
it back by a certain date, but wrote that she is taking steps
to obtain another copy. I need that book very much. If,
contrary to expectations, Manyasha needs the copy she sent
me, she should write to me about it immediately.

Nadya and I started reading Bernstein’s book
immediately; we have read more than a half and its contents
astonish us more and more as we go on. It is unbelievably weak
theoretically—mere repetition of someone else’s ideas.
There are phrases about criticism but no attempt at serious,
independent criticism. In effect it is opportunism (or
rather, Fabianism—the original of many of Bernstein’s
assertions and ideas is to be found in the Webbs’ recent books),
unbounded opportunism and possibilism, and cowardly
opportunism at that, since Bernstein does not want to attack
the programme directly. There is little doubt but what it

    

will be a fiasco. Bernstein’s statement that many Russians
agree with him ... (pp. 170 and 173, footnotes) made us
very indignant. We people here must indeed be getting
“old” and must be “lagging behind” the “new words”... copied
from Bernstein. I shall soon be writing to Anyuta on this
subject in
detail.[2]


Yesterday (at long last!) we received Webb, Volume II
in English (no German—we are asking for it today)—
without any letter or news about the first volume!

I now find that it is essential to make a few changes and
add something to my article against Bulgakov. I will do
this in the rough copy I have here. I ask Anyuta to demand
the immediate return of the second article and to keep it
until she receives my
corrections.[3]

 


We have little news. Anatoly gets worse and worse.
Gleb is leaving soon for Nizhneudinsk (Irkutsk Gubernia)
to work on the railway. Yelizaveta Vasilyevna yesterday
received a money order for 100 rubles.

Many kisses for you,


Yours,


V. U.

Regards from all.

P.S. I have found out that the Frankfurter Zeitung is
delivered to someone not far from here, so you need not
subscribe to it. I ask Manyasha to obtain for me (order
from Dresden or try to find them among acquaintances)
issues of the Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung for 1898 (1)
containing Parvus’s articles against Bernstein and (2) issues
Nos. 253, 254 and 255 for
1898.[4]

 
Notes
 

[1]
It is not known which of Vandervelde’s books is referred to
here—Ed.

[2]
Here a letter in invisible ink is meant.—Ed.
 



[3]
Owing to the loss of the manuscript, it is impossible to say what
corrections to his second article on “Capitalism in Agriculture”
Lenin is referring to. As can be seen by the next letter, he sent
them long before the article was published.





[4]
Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung (Saxon Workers’ Gazette)—a
Social-Democratic daily published in Dresden from 1890. From May 1,
1908 it was published as Dresdener Volkszeitung (Dresden People’s
Gazette).

An article by G. V. Plekhanov “Wofür sollen wir ihm dankbar
sein? Offener Brief an Karl Kautsky” (What Should We Thank
Him For? An Open Letter to Karl Kautsky) appeared in issues
253, 254 and 255; in this article Plekhanov criticised Bernstein
sharply. Bernstein polemised with Plekhanov over this article in
a footnote to the last chapter of his Voraussetzungen des
Sozialismus.

September 11, 1899

I have very sad news for you, Mother dearest. Anatoly
died on September 8, and on September 10 we buried him
at Yermakovskoye. There had been no hope of his recovery
for a long time past and the disease had been developing
terribly fast lately. His wife is staying in Yermakovskoye
for the time being. There is a threat that Mikhail
Alexandrovich Silvin will be recruited for the army; he has received
a notice to report in Minusinsk and is going there on
September 14. If he is taken, he will have to serve two years—
two months more than his term of exile.

Nadya and I have now got down to the second volume
of Webb without waiting either for the proofs of the first
volume (which would be very useful in editing the
translation of the second volume) or the German translation of
Volume II. The job will probably take quite a long time.

I am sending you with this letter a registered packet
containing the corrections to my article about Bulgakov.
I ask Anyuta to transfer these corrections to the manuscript
(cutting out the old and pasting in the new) and to get in
touch with the editors about its publication. I should like
to know the fate of the article as soon as possible.

We are all well.

Many kisses, my dear, and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

October 17, 1899

This week I have received a lot of interesting things
from home, Mother dearest, and send you many thanks for
them all. I was very glad to make the acquaintance of the
new French journal, which promises to be very interesting;
the mere fact of its appearance under the editorship of
Longuet is
noteworthy.[1] I am finishing reading the
Stuttgart minutes, also with considerable interest. And then,
the booklet on the professional congress in Moscow (which
I received on Friday) was also very interesting
and 
 instructive.[2]

There is a lull in the literary news. I believe I have
already written about reading of the publication of Volume I
of Webb and ordering one for myself because they
apparently think it superfluous to send me one. I have heard
about a new St. Petersburg paper—Severny
Kuryer[3]—and
intend to order it as soon as I see announcements in the
press. Yuly wrote to me from Turukhansk that a lengthy
article by M. Engelhardt had been published in Novosti;
it was called “The Cards Are Being Revealed” and it
simply tore Ilyin’s book on capitalism to pieces. It would be
interesting to read it if finding and purchasing that
particular issue in Moscow would not be too much trouble. I
rarely see Zhizn; the seventh issue was sent to me quite
unexpectedly direct from St. Petersburg, maybe even direct
from the editorial room (sic!!??!!). Comrades sometimes
send me Naucknoye Obozreniye; people living near here
whom I am sometimes able to meet receive it.
 

There have been no changes here. How have you fixed
yourselves up in Moscow? Who is going abroad, Anya or
Manyasha, and when? Did you leave Mitya alone in Podolsk?

Many kisses for you and regards to everybody.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The journal referred to was Le Mouvement Socialiste, a social
and political journal that first appeared in Paris in January 1899.
It published a number of letters from Frederick Engels and
articles by him. A number of the leaders of world Social-Democracy
contributed to the journal, among them Wilhelm Liebknecht,
Harry Quelch, Jean Jaurès, August Bebel and Rosa Luxemburg.
It also carried articles by the opportunists and revisionists
that dominated the Second International. Le Mouvement Socialiste
went out of existence in June 1914.





[2]
This booklet was apparently used by Lenin’s sister as the vehicle
of a letter in invisible ink and Lenin’s statement that the “booklet
on the professional congress in Moscow was very interesting and
instructive” obviously refers to the contents of the letter.

Severny Kuryer (Northern Courier)—a social, political and
literary daily that appeared in St. Petersburg in 1899 and 1900.

January 19 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

At last matters have been settled—we may go to Russia,
no further term of exile being envisaged. We are sending
our luggage off on the 28th and we ourselves shall leave
on the 29th. We shall have company—V.V. and Olga
Alexandrovna. The Lepeshinskys also intended going, but
I have very grave doubts of their being ready in time.
O.A. is in a hurry to get to M.A., who has been sent to Riga;
V.V. is also in a hurry. We shall probably leave Minusinsk
on the 30th. The only thing I am afraid of is that there may
be a delay because of me. We did not realise until recently
that we ought to find out whether I would have to apply
for permission to travel at my own expense. V.V. asked
the police officer and discovered that the application had
to be made to the Police Department, since the local officer
cannot issue me with a travel permit himself because he
has received no instructions about me. We are today sending
telegrams to the department and to the Knipoviches, but
further complications are almost
certain.[3] Volodya wants
to stay in Ufa for a couple of days until we know whether I
shall remain in Ufa or will be sent to some place like
Sterlitamak or Belebei. We do not talk of anything but the
journey nowadays. We have packed the books in a box and had
it weighed—about
15 poods.[1]

We are sending the books
and some of our things by carrier; I don’t think we shall
have very many things. Because of the frosts we wanted to
get a sleigh with a hood but we could not find one in the

    

town and to have one made here is a risky business, it
probably would not last as far as Achinsk. We have plenty
of warm clothes so I don’t suppose we shall freeze, and the
weather seems to be getting warmer; yesterday Oscar saw
a cloud somewhere and the temperature this morning was
only 28° below. The worst of it is that Mother keeps
catching colds and is coughing again. Volodya and I go out
every day, despite the frosts; we have become accustomed
to fresh air but I don’t know how Mother will make the
journey. Still, I wish the 29th would come soon; once we
are going we might as well go. The day of our departure
seems to be so close that today Mother wanted to start
making
pelmeni[2]

to take with us. We have been advised
to take pelmeni to eat on the way, everything else spoils
in the frost. Mother intends making mountains of the stuff,
with no fat or onions.

We are not doing much reading now. Volodya,
incidentally, is writing a reply to
Skvortsov.[4] We shall send
Webb off today, at long last; he has made us thoroughly
tired of him, I must say.

Well, good-bye. Many kisses, for you and for Manyasha
and Anyuta. It is a pity I shall not be able to come to
Moscow. Mother sends her regards.

Yours,

Nadya

You will probably receive this letter after a telegram
from me. I hope we shall be meeting soon.

Yours,

V. U.

(I have heard [A.N. wrote ] that the censor has slashed (!!)
Prokopovich’s book—and so I cannot answer him. A
strange
incident![5])

That same day, January 19, 1900, Nadezhda Krupskaya applied
to the Yeniseisk  Gubernia Council for permission to travel, to
Ufa at her own expense. She did not receive it  by the 29th and
left Shushenskoye with Lenin. She received her travel permit in
Minusinsk.

The Knipovich family were close friends of Krupskaya’s.

This refers to Lenin’s  article  “Uncritical   Criticism (Regarding

32).

S. N. Prokopovich’s The Working-Class Movement in the West.
An Essay in Critical Investigation (Vol.I, Germany, Belgium)
was held up by the St. Petersburg Censorship Committee (May 22,
1899) and was later passed for publication by the head of the
Central Press Board. It appeared at the end of January 1900.
Lenin wrote a review of this book (see Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp.
183–92).

March 15, 1900

I received your letter a few days ago, Mother dearest.
I sent an application about Nadya on the 10th and shall
soon be expecting an
answer.[2] If the worst comes to the
worst and the answer is unfavourable, I really am thinking
of asking you (if you are quite well enough) to go there and
see about it personally. That, however, is a matter for the
future—we’ll see when the time comes.

I have received Zhizn, so do not send me
another.[3]

Please ask Anyuta to send Archiv to Nadya (I have a
second copy here for the time being). I am not doing too
badly here, I go frequently to the library and do some
walking.

Excuse the short letter—I am late for the post. 
 

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

There is a doctor here who is well spoken of—I want
to see him about my catarrh. They say there are various
epidemics about in St. Petersburg now that spring is

approaching.[1]

On March 10, 1900, Lenin applied to the Director of the Police
Department for permission for Nadezhda Krupskaya to serve

The request was refused.





[3]
Lenin’s second   article   “Capitalism  in  Agriculture  (Kautsky’s
Book and Mr. Bulgakov’s Article)” was published in Zhizn No. 2
for 1900. It is  probable that this is the issue referred to in the
letter.

Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,


Kedrova’s House,


Podolsk,


Moscow Gubernia

April 6, 1900

Today I received a letter from Manyasha (dated April 3),
Mother dearest, in which she reproaches me for my silence.
I really am at fault, I did not even congratulate you and
Manyasha on April 1. The fact is that at that time I was
once again “in a whirl” (as Nadya put it in a letter to the
Siberian comrades) over the arrival of a long-expected

traveller[1]

(who has by now most likely arrived home).

Life goes on here as usual, I am quite well and today
tried doing without my “waters”. I take walks—walking
is not at all bad here at present and, it seems, there are
plenty of nice places in Pskov (and also in its environs).
I have bought some postcards with views of Pskov in a
local shop and am sending three of them—to you, Manyasha
and
Anyuta.[2]


Yesterday I received a letter from M.A., who writes
(on April 4) that he is going back to Siberia (with O.A.)
tomorrow or the next day—the army authorities have again
changed the place where he is to do his service. He promises
to send his new address from Achinsk.
 

Nadya is most probably in bed; the doctor finds (as she
wrote in a letter a week ago) that her illness
(gynaecological) needs persistent treatment and she must remain in
bed for anything from two to six weeks. (I have sent her
some more money—I received 100 rubles from Vodovozova—
because her treatment will entail considerable expense.
So far I have enough money, but if I run short I shall write
to you.) So she would not be able to come to me now, even
if she had permission (I still have no reply and have almost
given up expecting one). I am thinking of going to visit
her in the spring, in about six weeks—or perhaps earlier.

An acquaintance of mine
here[3]

has applied for a passport
and is thinking of going abroad for a cure after April 20;
I shall be rather lonely here without him.

I am taking lessons in German from a local German
at 50 kopeks a lesson. We translate from Russian and talk
a little—there is not much progress and I am wondering
whether I should not give it up; for the time being, however,
I shall continue. I am not working very much and have still
not finished the Index to Webb.

I go to the library and read the newspapers. I see very
few new books, I have not seen
Davydov’s.[4]

I do
not intend to answer P. Struve (I sent a short note
against him to be inserted into my reply to
Skvortsov);[5]
I have seen Kachorovsky and am thinking of answering him.
Has Manyasha seen Nauchnoye Obozreniye Nos. 3 and 4?
There is an excellent article on Pisarev
there.[6]

And so Mitya has given up his job and gone back to his
studies? Excellent. Is Manyasha working very hard? Where
and how are Anyuta and Mark?

Best wishes for Easter to you, dear, and many kisses.
Thank Manyasha for her letter. Regards to Mitya.

Yours,

V. U.

note against Struve mentioned in the letter is the footnote at the
end of the article  “Uncritical Criticism”. (see Collected Works,

Today, Mother dearest, I am sending you the pamphlet
by Mech with the reprint from Nauchnoye
Obozreniye[1]

which
I promised. Forgive me for keeping it so long. How are
you? What arrangements has Anyuta made, where is she
now and what has she decided to do for the summer?

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Podolsk,


Moscow Gubernia

April 30, 1900

I have received your letter and Manya’s of the 25th, Mother
dearest. I shall probably get away from here earlier, in
something like a fortnight from now, but I cannot say
anything at all definite.

I think I wrote telling you I had asked permission to
spend six weeks in
Ufa.[2] I hope to receive an answer soon.

Nadya writes that her health is improving. She has not
received Archiv from Anyuta. Here is something I should
like to ask Anyuta to do—can she get back that “Archiv”
before I arrive and not send it to Nadya, because I now need
it (I could take it to Nadya myself) and the second copy
that I expected never reached me. I should very much like
to have it when I visit you.

Ask Manyasha to send me Nadya’s
translation.[1]

I will
send it to the journal.

Filippov writes that even from the article against
Skvortsov the censor has thrown out almost a third! That is really
too bad!

Many kisses for you and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes

On April 20, 1900, Lenin applied to the Director of the Police
Department for permission to live in Ufa for six weeks on account
of the illness of his wife. The petition was refused.

May 5, 1900

Your letter of the 2nd with Manyasha’s postscript, I
received only today, Mother dearest. I do not know why
the letter was delayed (you expected me to receive it on
the 3rd or not later than the 4th); it is postmarked “Mail
train 2nd” and “Pskov 4th”, so there does not seem to have
been any real delay; the letter arrived in Pskov on the 4th
and was delivered this morning. A letter is not likely to
reach me as quickly from Podolsk as from Moscow.

There is no need for you to worry about me, Mother
dearest. My health is much better, I gave up taking the mineral
water a long time ago and have never felt any desire or need
to return to it. Yesterday I received a certificate from the
local Chief of Police to the effect that he has no objection
to my making a journey abroad; today I paid the stamp
duty (ten rubles) and in two hours’ time I shall receive my
passport. And so I shall be moving to warmer parts in
summer; I cannot leave here immediately because there are
some matters I must settle with editors and with certain
publishers of translations and also wind up some financial
affairs (I hope, by the way, to get a few coppers from
Filippov; if I get none, either from him or Popova, I will
write and ask you to send me something). I must, moreover,
wait here for an answer to my request to the Department
for permission to live in Ufa for six weeks on account of
my wife’s illness. I submitted the request on April 20 and
there should be an answer in about a week. I shall definitely
visit Nadya, but I still do not know whether I shall be able
to live with her for six weeks or whether (which is the more
probable) I shall have to make do with a shorter period.
In any case the receipt of the passport (I have to receive

    

it here in Pskov, my last place of residence) does not restrict
me because the law says that I may go abroad any time
within three months on a passport issued in the interior
gubernias, so that I shall not be late even if I leave Russia
on August 5. I am therefore leaving here between the 15th
and the 20th, as I wrote you before; I shall try to leave
earlier, of course. Please write and tell me what to do with
my things; shall I leave them in Moscow (is Mark there and
what is his address? will he be in Moscow long? does he visit
you often?) or bring them straight to Podolsk (I don’t know
if that will be convenient; I suppose I shall have to take
everything with me, including books), and I should like
Manyasha to write me in detail how to find you in Podolsk.

I embrace you and send regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

I shall be seeing you soon!

Nadya writes that her health is improving.

I have just received my passport from the Chancellory
of the Governor and have enquired about my request to go
to Ufa; now it turns out that I have been refused! That is
something I certainly did not expect and am now quite
at a loss what to do!

I have just received your letter of the 8th, Mother
dearest, and am replying at once. I am very glad permission
has been granted for me to visit you and it goes without
saying that I shall certainly take advantage of it;
unfortunately I cannot leave here at once; I do not want to come
back here, so I must stay on for 5-7 days or so to settle some
financial affairs and certain editorial business. It doesn’t
matter, of course, whether I come a week earlier or later;
I am, in general, in agreement with the arguments put
forward by you and Anyuta (by the way—merci for the work
on urban statistics which I received today) and think of
doing as you advise, the only thing is I must give up the
idea of a personal visit to St. Petersburg and shall,
therefore, ask you to go, if you can manage it, by Thursday the
18th, or, if you can’t, by Thursday the 25th, depending
on when we
meet.[1]

See you soon.


Yours,


V. U.

Just a few lines, Mother dearest, to let you know that
my departure has unfortunately been delayed for a time,
but not for long; I hope to see you on Sunday or on
Tuesday evening, the 21st or the
23rd.[2] Many kisses and please
do not worry about my health; I now feel quite well and walk
a lot as we are having such glorious weather. After two

Lenin’s journey to Podolsk was delayed. On May 20, 1900 he
went secretly to St. Petersburg to meet local Social-Democrats
and establish means of communication to be used after his leaving
Russia. On May 21 he was arrested for illegal entry into the
capital. He was released on May 31 and was dispatched to Podolsk
in the company of a police official, arriving on June 1.

Mother dearest,

Unfortunately I have to tell you that our meeting has
to be postponed for a time. I must pay a short visit to a
comrade in
Siberia,[1] so I shall not be passing through
Podolsk before the 20th or 21st (most likely the 20th, I
think). Then all I shall have to do is get my things together,
get visas in my passport and continue on my way. If the
things have not yet arrived, I would ask Mitya to take the
most energetic measures, up to and including a personal
trip. Our people are all well and send their regards.

I embrace you fondly, Mother dearest, and send regards
to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Lenin intended going to Siberia to see G. M. Krzhizhanovsky but

to Podolsk from Ufa and on July 16 went abroad to organise the
all-Russia illegal newspaper Iskra (The Spark).

Russia

August 31, 1900

I am surprised, Mother dearest, that I have not received
a single letter from you; I wrote to you twice from
Paris[2]
and am now writing while travelling (I have been on a
trip down the
Rhine).[3] I am well and am having a good
time; I saw Anyuta a few days
ago,[1]

took a trip on a very
beautiful lake with her and enjoyed the wonderful views
and the good weather—there has not been much good
weather here either, mostly rain and thunderstorms. It’s
as bad a summer here for tourists as it is in Russia.

Many kisses for you and regards to all. I ask Manyasha
to send me as soon as possible all the books there are for
me; as regards the boxes—I hope to write soon.

Yours,

V. U.

You may write to me at the same address (or to Anyuta
to forward to me, although that is slower than if letters
are sent to Paris).

 
Notes

Lenin’s elder sister Anna was also abroad at the time.—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin did not live in Paris in 1900, and if he went there at all it
was only for a short time; for purposes of secrecy he sent letters
to Russia through Paris.





[3]
This was said for the sake of secrecy. Early in September 1900
Lenin actually went to Nuremberg on his way to Munich for
talks with the German Social-Democrat A. Braun about
organisational and technical assistance in publishing Iskra.

Paris,[1] September 7, 1900

I received Manya’s letter and postcard, Mother dearest,
and was glad to have news from home. I returned from
my Rhine trip several days ago. I am not thinking of
staying here for long, and shall probably be moving on soon.
I don’t know where yet, but will write when it is certain.

Manyasha grumbles at the shortness of my letters; I admit
my guilt, but by way of justification must say that here
you are in a whirl all the time and there is such a wealth
of impressions that it is difficult to choose what to dwell
upon and describe in greater detail. I hope that when I
leave here, when I am farther away from the turmoil of the
exhibition with its peculiar exhibition atmosphere, I shall
be able to concentrate better and write more clearly. Until
then, please excuse me for the emptiness of my letters.

Many kisses for you, my dear, and regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Manyasha says nothing about your health; I hope that
means you are well.

How are Mitya’s affairs going? When is Mark moving,
and when will you all be in Moscow? What do you know
about Manyasha’s
case?[2]

 
Notes

Lenin was in Munich at this time. Paris is named for purposes

September 19 (N.S.), 1900

Yesterday (no, not yesterday—the 16th) I received your
letter of August 23, Mother dearest, and was very glad to
get it. I have also received Manyasha’s first letter and
her postcard of August 24 saying that another letter with
a reminder had come from the
carrier’s.[1] I have already
sent Manyasha an address which she should pass on to them.
I hope she has received it.

It is a great pity that Mitya has been refused admission
to the University. It is a hell of a business, having to lose
another year! Perhaps it can still be managed with the help
of one of those guarantors you mention. Manyasha’s
position also seems to be indefinite, doesn’t it?

I got a letter from Anyuta yesterday and hope to see
her soon—we do a great deal of walking together. I intend
taking the waters again soon and being more regular with
the cure. The weather here is good now; the rainy days
are over and it looks as if we shall be able to do some good
walking. I have plenty of shirts and underclothes and
money, Mother dearest, so there is no need to send anything
for the time being; I hope I shall not have to write about
this in the near future, and I shall try to reckon up in
advance when the necessity arises.

I also got a letter from Nadya yesterday; she says they
are fixed up quite well, she has heaps of lessons that keep
her busy seven hours a day!
 

I embrace you fondly, Mother dearest, and send my
regards to all. I hope you will soon be able to make final
arrangements for the winter and will have better
accommodation.

Yours,

V. U.

There’s one thing I almost forgot to add—on September 17
(that will be the 4th by our calendar) I received Braun’s
Archiv that I had left behind. It was done very quickly!
A big merci to Manyasha.

Ulyanova,[1]

Sharonov’s House,


Bakhmetyevskaya Street, 25,


Moscow,


Russia

November 6, 1900 
 

Manyasha,

I have received your letter, Manyasha, many thanks
for it.

I received the books a few days ago and was horrified
when I opened the big box. It contained the medical books of
an Anna Fedulova (from Barnaul in Siberia) who had studied
in Lausanne and Geneva from 1893 to 1899. How absurd
and disgraceful! I know nothing about this person and
hear her name for the first time. How could her books have
got here? How could they have been sent to Moscow to the
wrong address? Why did nobody enquire about them during
the months they were lying in Moscow?

Try to find out, if you can, what it is all about. For all
the books I paid about 40 (forty!) rubles. So for someone
else’s books I must have overpaid about thirty rubles on
account of the neglect of some utterly irresponsible persons.

I shall write to Siberia and to Switzerland, asking them
to try and find the lady. In the meantime I have put the
books into a warehouse. I must get in touch with the

    

carrier’s office that sent the box. Let me have their exact
address. Perhaps the owner of the books will soon be asking
for them. Did they issue a receipt for the books? If so, how
could they have surrendered them (here) without it? Try
and go to them to get an explanation, or—better—write
to them, register the letter and send a stamp for a reply.

(I think the owner of the books should refund my expenses
since she is at fault for sending the books to a strange
address without any notification.)

I have received a letter from Lirochka, who sends you
and Mother thousands of the warmest greetings. I do not
suppose I shall have an opportunity to see her.

I have received my books in good order—merci for them.

I am repeating my address—just in case.

Herrn Franz Modrá\v cek, Sm\v ecky, 27  Prag. Oesterreich
(Austria).[3]

The weather here has been bad, but today is wonderful,
warm and sunny. We shall see what winter is like here.

I am still living as usual, I study languages a little,
exchange German and Russian lessons with a Czech
(conversations rather than lessons) and visit the library.

Please give Mother many kisses from me. Is she now
quite well? How is Mark? Do not forget to obtain for me
the address of the China
traveller.[2]


All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

November 7

Excuse me for having delayed sending the letter.
Yesterday I received your books (merci for them—the selection
is excellent) and your letter of October 10. Why did it take
so long?

Today, Manyasha, I received your letter of November 6
and the letter that was enclosed in it. Thanks.

I did not receive your previous letter, so I don’t know
how to send the medical books. To whom? To the owner
of the books? Can you not get the money they cost from
her in advance?

I am quite well and life goes on as usual. Please give
Mother many kisses for me and my very best regards to
Mark.

Do you get my letters in good time? Check the
postmarks, please, and let me know.

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received the letters forwarded to me by
Manyasha. Merci for them. I do not know whether I shall
soon get round to sending a reply to Siberia—I have also
had a letter lying here unanswered for a long time.

Yesterday I had a letter from Anyuta. She writes that
she does not yet know how long she will be in Paris. You
have probably received letters from her, too.

Are you expecting Mitya home for the holidays? How
is he getting on with his medicine and German?

What sort of weather are you having? You probably
have a fine winter. Here we have slush and autumn rain—
if the whole “winter” is going to be like this it will be worse
than frost and snow. It is true that there are occasionally
some very fine days, when it is dry and clear—but only
by way of exception.

Where does Mark intend spending his vacation? In
Moscow, or will he go away somewhere?

How is Manyasha getting on? Isn’t she working too
much? Is she quite well again now? Perhaps it would do
her good to run around more, that is, to walk from one part

    

of the town to another. Anyuta writes that Manyasha may
come here with Nadya.

Life goes on here as usual. I am wandering aimlessly
in a strange land and still only “hoping” to put an end
to the fuss and bother and settle down to work.

Nadya writes often. She is well, but Y.V. always seems
to be out of sorts.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Does Manyasha go skating? There is some sort of a
künstliche (!)
Eisbahn[1]

here; I keep intending to take a look
at this fake. Even their ice is artificial—poor Prague

people![2]

December 14, 1900

I have received your letter, Manyasha, in which you
repeat the address for the books. Tomorrow I am having
the box mended—it has suffered from long journeys and
I cannot risk sending it like that—and will then forward
it through some carrier’s office. I will send the receipt
by registered letter direct to Fedulova and will write to
you when it has been
sent.[1]


I have had a letter from
S.I.[2] and, I think, have informed
you of it.

Yesterday I got a letter from Anya. She seems to be
thinking of remaining here (abroad, that is) a little longer,
but does not know how things are at home and whether you
are expecting her very eagerly for Christmas.

Mitya did well to claim the money from the railway.
Of course it could not be ignored.

All the best and please give Mother many kisses for me.

    

Regards to Mark and Mitya. Excuse me for the brevity
of this letter—it is late already. I will add something
tomorrow if I have time. If not, I shall send it as it is.

Yours,

V. U.

I have just learned that the box has been mended. I shall,
therefore, send it off today (or tomorrow at the latest) and
inform you of its despatch only in the unlikely event of
there being some delay. I will send the receipt by registered
post to the same address. I remember that I sent you the
things that interested you on the ninth. Have you received
them?

Very best regards to all, to Mother in particular.

Yours,

V. U.

December 26, 1900

Mother dearest,

You will probably receive this letter shortly before the
holidays. All best wishes and may you have a good time;
perhaps Mitya will come and you will all get together—at least
everyone who is in Russia. Anya and I also thought of
getting together, but we could not manage it. Here it is already

Weihnachten[1]

—

Christbäume[2]

everywhere and the streets
have been unusually lively over the last few days. I went
to Vienna a few days ago and enjoyed the journey after
several weeks of
immobility.[3] But a winter without snow
is unpleasant. Actually there is no winter at all, it is like
a rotten autumn; everything wet and dripping. It is a good
thing it is not cold and I can manage quite well without
a winter overcoat, but somehow it’s not very nice without
snow. I am fed up with the slush and recall with pleasure
the real Russian winter, the sleigh rides and the clean
frosty air. I am spending my first winter abroad, the first
winter that is nothing at all like a winter, and I cannot
say that I have been very pleased, although at times there

    

are fine days like those we have at home in late autumn,
when the weather is good.

There has been no change in my way of life; it is rather
lonely and, unfortunately, rather purposeless. I keep hoping
to arrange my studies more systematically but I don’t
seem to manage it. In spring things will certainly go better
and I shall get “on to the rails”. Since my Shushenskoye
immobility I have done a lot of wandering through Russia
and abroad and am now longing for some peaceful writing
again; it is only the unaccustomed foreign atmosphere that
prevents me really getting down to it.

Are you keeping well, Mother dearest? Are you not
lonely without Anyuta? How is Manya’s case coming along?
By the way, I forgot to tell her that I have received
Pushkin and am very grateful, and that I also got her letter of
December 6. I have hot answered because of my journey,
and since then I have been very busy.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send best regards
to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter of December 26th with
Manyasha’s postscript and was very glad to hear that Mitya
was with you and that you had a good time at Christmas.
It is a pity it is so terribly cold; when I tell the Germans
(or the Czechs) about a temperature of 28° below zero
Réaumur they simply gasp and wonder how the Russians
manage to stay alive. Here 8° or 10° below zero R is considered
cold, furchtbare
Kälte[1]

and almost everybody manages with
only an autumn coat (admittedly most of them wear woollen
jerseys as well). The houses here are not at all adapted to
severe cold, the walls are thin, the windows are not caulked
up tight and very often there are not even
Winterfenster.[2]

You have no need to worry about me; I eat well at a
boarding-house where I have been staying since autumn. I feel
quite well, probably because I run around a lot more than
I sit still. Nadya’s arrival is not far away now—her term
will be up in two and a half
months,[3]

and then I shall
make all the proper arrangements.
 

I send hearty greetings to Mitya and Mark, and many
thanks to Manyasha for the books she sent, and especially
for the unusually beautiful and interesting photographs
from our cousin in Vienna; I should like to receive such
gifts more
often.[4]

Many kisses, my dear, and I hope you will keep well.

Yours,

V. Ul.

January 27, 1901

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received a letter and a postcard from
Manyasha and also a photo of Mitya, and Protopopov’s
book. Thanks for everything. I was very glad to get Mitya’s
photo—I think it is a good one. I have already begun to
long for photographs and will certainly ask Nadya to bring
my album, and if you have any new photographs, please
send them.

I don’t need any warm clothing now. Winter here seems
to be over—I mean real winter with snow and temperatures
below zero. It was warm and rainy right up to the end of
December. Then it snowed and the temperature began to
drop to 10°–15° below zero R (mornings) and the Germans
complained of the “terrible” cold. In their houses it really
is terribly cold, even when there are only three degrees of
frost outside; the houses are badly built. A thaw set in
about a week ago, all the snow disappeared in one night,
and the weather is now like March in Russia or April in
Siberia. It is possible—even probable—that there will
be some more snow, but only for a very short time. The
coldest period is over; last month I had to spend five rubles

    

on Holz und
Kohle[1]

instead of one or two rubles, as in
previous months.

I am quite well and there are no changes. I correspond
with Anyuta and hope to see her soon.

Many kisses for you, my dear, and best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Less than two months remain to the end of Nadya’s
term of exile; she will be coming soon and will, of course,
be seeing you. And in summer I hope that we shall be
together.

Mother dearest,

How are you? What news is there, what does Mitya write
from Yuriev—he is probably working hard now the
examinations are drawing near.

I recently received some old manuscripts from Manyasha
and the Vienna
gifts.[1] A big merci for them.

The weather here is again turning wintry, i.e., there
has been some snow. It is not cold, however, and the snow
melts during the day.

I was at the opera a few days ago and heard La Juive
with the greatest pleasure; I heard it once in Kazan (when
Zakrzhevsky sang)—that must be thirteen years ago, and
some of the tunes have remained in my memory. The music
and singing were good. I have also been to theatres (German)
on a few occasions and sometimes understood something,
the general idea, at any rate. Do you go to the Moscow
theatres?

Anyuta wrote recently that her work will detain her
for a while yet.

Are you thinking of applying for permission for Nadya
to visit you, my dear, just for a few days? She would
probably like that very much, but the metropolitan cities are

    

usually forbidden—after
Ufa,[2] she writes, they are the
only prohibited places.

I should like Manyasha to drop me a line saying when
she subscribes to magazines for me, so that I know when
to ask for them at the post office.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

February 20, 1901 
 

Mother dearest,

It is quite a time since I had a letter from you. The only
news I have had was from Manyasha, sent on the 6th, and
for that many thanks. How are you? Not freezing too badly?
Are you keeping well?

It is cold here again, and there has been so much snow—
more than for the last 13 years—so people say. There have
been cases of trains being held up by snowdrifts. But it
seems to be winter’s last effort. I am used to it by now
and have adapted myself to the local winter—nevertheless
if I have to spend the next winter in these parts I shall
write for a quilted coat. Without it you either have to wear
a woollen jersey or put on two sets of underclothes (as I
do). At first it was not very comfortable but I got used
to it long ago. And in any case the cold here is not like
the Russian cold. If it’s 10° below zero that’s a “terrible
frost”.

The carnival ended here a few days ago. This is the first
time I have seen the last day of a carnival in a foreign
country—processions of people in fancy dress, general
buffoonery, showers of confetti (tiny scraps of coloured
paper) thrown in your face, paper streamers and so on. People
here do know how to make merry publicly, in the streets!




I am quite well, probably because I run about rather
a lot, and do not sit still for long. In general life is much
the same.
 

Nadya’s term of exile will soon be over (March 24 by the
calendar here, March 11 by yours). In a day or two I shall
send an application for a passport for her. I should like
Manyasha to send a box of “my” pen-nibs with her. Believe
it or not, I have not been able to find them here. Foolish
people, these Czechs and Germans—no English nibs, only
“our own” make, which is awful rubbish.

What does Mitya write? When will the exams be over?

What does Mark intend to do this summer?

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health. Regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Do you go to the theatre? What is this new play of
Chekhov’s, Three Sisters? Have you seen it and do you like it?
I read a review in the papers. They act well at the Moscow
Art Theatre—I still remember with pleasure my visit to
that theatre last year with poor old Columbus. Is he well?
I keep intending to write to him but am always too busy

February 27, 1901

I have received Manyasha’s letter of February 2, 1901,
Mother dearest, and also the journal
Promyshlenny Mir,[1]
for which merci.

It does not seem worth while now sending the articles
that have been returned from Nauchnoye
Obozreniye,[2]
better simply send them with Nadya.

How does one write to A.V. in Nikolsk? I wrote to him
once in Harbin but have no idea whether my letter reached
him or not. Please let me have his exact address (and, if
you happen to write to him, give him mine), I should from
time to time like to know something about him, at least.

Anya, it appears, has delayed her departure somewhat.
She has probably written to you herself.

Excuse the brief letter. I have no time at the moment.
In a few days I shall write more.

Best regards to all.


Many kisses for you,


Yours,


V. U.

March 2, 1901

Mother dearest,

This is to tell you of a change in my address. I have
moved together with my landlord:

Herrn Franz Modrav\v cek, Vr\v sovice bei Prag, No. 384.
Oesterreich.[1]


I am going to Vienna
now.[2] It seems that there is no
Russian consul here (!) and I must have my signature
witnessed on my application for Nadya’s passport. I hope to
be able to write something to you from Vienna.

I am sorry I have not studied Czech. It is interesting
that it is very much like Polish and contains many old
Russian words. I recently went away for a time and when
I returned to Prague its Slav character struck me very
forcibly—names ending in -\v cik, -\v cek, etc., words like lze, lekarna,
and so on and so forth. The weather is now warm and
springlike and I shall probably have a nice trip to Vienna.

Are you all well at home? How are Mitya’s affairs? I
embrace you fondly, my dear, and send regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,


Sharonov’s House,


Bakhmetyevskaya Street,


Moscow,


Russia

Vienna, March 4, 1901

I have come here, Mother dearest, on a hunt for
“papers” for Nadya. There was no Russian consul in Prague
and my application for a passport for Nadya had to be
witnessed. Vienna is a huge, lively and beautiful city. After
the “province” where I live it is pleasant to see the
metropolis. There is something to look at here, so it is worth while
stopping off (should any of you be travelling this way).
For this purpose I have sent Nadya a pocket Führer durch
Wien. I hope she will soon be seeing you—there should
be no hitch with the passport now. I ask Manyasha, when
she happens to be in the centre of the town, to buy
Hendschel’s Telegraph (two marks) for Nadya (it is not worth
the trouble of sending one from here).

Among other things, I have seen the Museum der
bildenden
Künste[1]

here, and even saw a Viennese operetta. I did
not like it very much. I was also at a meeting where a
Volksuniversitätskurse[2]

was in progress. I got in at the
wrong time and went away quickly.

Regards to everyone; many kisses for you, my dear.

Yours,

V. U.
 

It is probable that a letter from Anyuta, or perhaps
yours or Manyasha’s, is waiting for me at home.

Just in case of accidents I am repeating my new address:
Herrn Franz Modráček. Vršovice bei Prag. Oesterreich.

May 19, 1901 
 

Mother dearest,

I have just received your letter with Mark’s letter
enclosed and immediately have sent them both on to Anyuta,
who has left for Berlin. She wants to do some work in the
libraries there. I hope she will find it much more convenient
in Berlin than here—the
Prague[1]

libraries are not up to
much.

I am very sorry you have been unable to get a decent
apartment, and that your summer place is not good either.
The summer does not look promising for those who spend it
in the country if one may judge by the beginning and by
the weather here—cloudy and rainy. It is all right for us,
of course, because we stay in town all summer, but it will
be rotten for you. Perhaps Mitya will be able to find you
something better. I also hope very much that Mark and
Manyasha will soon manage to be with
you.[2] Judging
by Mark’s letter, he has to some extent adapted himself
to the new conditions and found himself an occupation,
so as not to be bored and not to impair his health too
greatly. I am writing to him and Manyasha and ask you
to send them the letters.
 

Many kisses for you, my dear; from the bottom of my
heart I wish you good health and vigour and, especially,
that you will soon be together with Manyasha and Mark.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards to Mitya. He must be very busy, I suppose.

May 19, 1901

I have decided to write you a few lines, dear Manyasha,
or you will be thinking I have turned into a real pig. I have
been forgetting my obligations surprisingly often since I
have been here. It is true that now Nadya and Y.V. have
arrived we are much more comfortable; we have our own
apartment and I am beginning to work more regularly, but
there is still more than enough bother.

How are you? I hope you have got yourself into a more
correct regime for that is so important in solitary confinement.
I have just written a letter to Mark in which I described in
exceptional detail how best to establish a “regime”; as
regards mental work, I particularly recommended
translations, especially both ways—first do a written translation
from the foreign language into Russian, then translate
it back from Russian into the foreign language. My own
experience has taught me that this is the most rational
way of learning a language. On the physical side I have
strongly recommended him, and I repeat it to you, to do
gymnastics every day and rub himself down with a wet
towel. In solitary confinement this is absolutely essential.
I saw from one of your letters that Mother sent on to me
that you have found some ways of employing your time.
I hope this will enable you to forget, even if only
occasionally, your surroundings, and that the passage of time (which
usually passes quickly in prison unless conditions are
particularly bad) will be even less noticeable. I also advise
you to arrange your work on the books you have in such
a way as to vary it; I remember quite well that a change

    

of reading or work—from translation to reading, from
writing to gymnastics, from serious reading to fiction—helps
a great deal. Sometimes a change of mood for the worse—
one’s mood changes so easily in prison—is due simply to
fatigue from monotonous impressions or monotonous work,
and a change of occupation is often enough to bring one
back to normal and calm one’s nerves. I remember that
after dinner, for recreation in the evening, I read fiction
regelmässig,[1]

and never enjoyed it anywhere as much as
I did in prison. The main thing is never to forget the
obligatory daily gymnastics. Force yourself to go through
several dozen (no allowances!) movements of all kinds!
This is very important. Well, good-bye for now. Many
kisses; I wish you good health and vigour.

Yours,

Vlad. Ulyanov

June 7, 1901 
 

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter of May 10 and newspapers
from Mitya. Many thanks for the letter and the papers.
I would ask Mitya in future to send any interesting issues
of Russian newspapers that he can get hold of; there is no
library here and I seldom see anything but Russkiye
Vedomosti....

Anyuta is now in Berlin and has already written to me
that she has received the royalties that were sent her, and
that in general she receives your letters more quickly than
before.

I am very glad that you like your summer place and can
spend a lot of time in the open air. From what Anyuta said
I had imagined your new place to be much too flimsy and
cold. What is it like there when it rains?

It is sad there is no change in the affairs of Mark
and Manyasha. Just before Anyuta left I wrote letters
to them containing a lot of stuff about how to spend
one’s time in prison. I don’t know whether the letters got
there and actually reached them.

We have fixed our apartment up very nicely here. Rents
are cheaper here than in such (relatively) big towns in
Russia; we furnished the place with second-hand things we
bought cheap, and Yelizaveta Vasilyevna and Nadya
manage the housekeeping themselves without any particular
trouble—housekeeping here is much easier. The place is
a good one, too—on the outskirts; there is water near us

    

and a park with lots of greenery. There are good connections
with the centre, thanks to the electric trams.

A few days ago I received 250 rubles from my publisher
and the financial side of things is now not bad. In general,
I am fixed up here comfortably in all respects and have
only one wish—for our two to be released as soon as possible,
so that you will not have to remain almost alone.

Y.V. and Nadya are well and send their best regards to
you and all our people. Nadya intends to write soon.

Many kisses for you, my dear, and I wish you very good
health.

Yours,

V. Ul.

July 1, 1901

Mother dearest,

It is quite a long time since I had news of you. Are you
well? I recently received from Anya a letter of Mark’s with
a postscript to me that you had sent her. I was very glad
to hear from him (there has been no reply to my letter from
Manyasha), but I was sorry to learn of the rather wretched
arrangements in their cells. Their imprisonment has come
at a bad time—summer. By the way, the summer here is
not hot and there is a lot of rain. What is your summer
like?

I have received the 75 rubles that Mitya sent, which
probably came from the sale of my gun. Merci for the
money. Did he receive Nadya’s letter in which she asked
him to send me three copies of my book on capitalism?

Have you any acquaintances in Podolsk? Do you see
the gentleman we went boating with last
year?[1] You
probably go to Moscow once a week, or perhaps more than
once, don’t you? Have any of the Siberian friends called
on you when passing
through?[2]

I embrace you, Mother dearest, and wish you good health.
Very best regards from all to Mitya, Mark and Manyasha.

Yours,

V. U.

July 17, 1901




A few days ago I received a letter from you which had
been forwarded to me by Anyuta. I was exceedingly glad
to learn that there is a hope of our people being released
shortly. Perhaps the authorities will realise that there is
no “case” to be made of it. Even if they do make out a
“case”, they should let them out soon, because now, in
incomparably more important cases, people are released
on remand “until the investigation has been completed”.
It is a good thing that Manyasha feels well and vigorous,
as I see from the letter Anyuta sent on to me.

Anyuta wrote me a few days ago that she is thinking
of going to stay in the country; it would not be a bad thing,
although I must say that towns abroad are better adapted
to the summer—the streets are watered more often, etc.—
and it is easier to spend the summer here in town than it
is in Russia. We, for instance, are able to swim every day
in a very good swimming pool at a relatively low cost,
there are places for walks and one does not have to go far
to get out of town. The traffic in the streets here is far less
than in an equally large Russian city; this is because the
electric trams and bicycles are completely ousting cabs.
The commercial traffic in the suburb where we live is
exceedingly small. For this reason we are quite content with
our present place of residence and do not intend to go to a
village or summer resort.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to Mitya and especially to Mark and Manyasha.

Yours,

V. U.

August 3, 1901 
 

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter of June 13. A big merci for
it. It is very strange that they won’t allow even Mitya
a visit. There is one consolation—the case is coming to
an end and soon our people will be released and sent into
exile. Perhaps it can be arranged not too far from Moscow—
I am talking about Manyasha, since Mark, as you say, has
decided to go to his
brother.[1] Since Mark’s case will
probably end without a conviction there perhaps remains a
hope of his being able to complete the
course[2]—if not
in the normal period, at least with the loss of only a year;
he may be able to get special permission, since he has
graduated in mathematics.

When is Mitya going away, and for how long? When
will he be through with his examinations? What does he
think of doing? Is he still as keen to become a public
health officer?

Life here goes on as usual. I had thought of taking a
short trip with Nadya but the weather is too changeable.
We are again having rainy days now. This summer has been
just the kind to spend in town, rather than in the country.

I am expecting a letter soon from Anyuta with her new
address.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to Mitya, Mark and Manyasha.

Yours,

V. Ul.

from Manyasha enclosed. It was very sad to learn that our
people’s affairs are in such a sorry state! I just don’t know
what to advise, my dear. Please don’t worry too much—the
prosecutor’s office is probably making so much trouble
by way of a last attempt to work up a “case” out of nothing,
and when these attempts fail they will have to grant a
release. It might help to go to St. Petersburg, if your health
permits, and complain of something so unheard of as no
interrogation for six months. That constitutes such a
definite and obvious illegal act that it is the best thing to
submit a complaint about it. In any case,
Petersburg would send an inquiry to Moscow and cause the
latter to abandon a little of its provincial high-handedness
(that was what happened when Mitya was arrested). That
is the argument in favour of a trip to St. Petersburg. There
is, of course, also an argument against it—the outcome is
doubtful and it will cause you a great deal of
anxiety. You are in the best position to decide whether it is
worth while undertaking anything of the sort, and you have
probably discussed it with acquaintances. You should also
complain of the refusal to allow Mitya to see
Manyasha,[1]
because that is something very much out of the ordinary.

As far as concerns Anyuta, I shall not, of course, write
to her about what you have told me, so as not to upset her
too much. I hope I shall soon—perhaps in a few weeks—be
seeing her and will try to reassure her a little.
 

When you have some spare time, my dear, please write
and tell me how you are keeping, whether you are quite
well and what you are thinking of doing in the autumn.
Are you moving to Moscow or will you remain in Podolsk
for the time being? When is M.V.
leaving?[2] When you
see Manyasha and Mark again, give them best regards from
all of us. Now summer has passed—summer is the worst
time to be in prison—and after the interrogation they
will probably realise a little more clearly how trivial the
whole affair is.

I embrace you again and again, my dear, and wish you
good health and vigour. You remember, when I was locked
up, you imagined the case to be more serious and dangerous
than it was, and, of course, Manyasha’s and Mark’s case
bears no comparison with mine! They are probably being
held a long time, partly because so many people have been
arrested and the case has not yet been properly sorted out—
anything so absurd would, of course, be impossible in St.
Petersburg.

I again kiss you,


Yours,


V. Ul

Life here goes on as usual; Yelizaveta Vasilyevna is rather
poorly, there is influenza about again. Nadya seems to be
quite at home by now and is used to this way of life.

September 21, 1901 
 

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter of August 22. Merci for it
and also for the money (35 rubles), which we at last received
after long delays that had been caused accidentally by a
friend. Our finances are not in too bad a state. My publisher
has sent me something and I hope to manage on that for
quite a time, especially as the cost of living here is not
high if you run your own house. There is no need to send
anything, merci.

We also received your letter to Nadya a short while ago
and I replied to
it.[1]

Did you get my reply?

I have had the news from Anyuta that the investigation
of the case involving our people is finished and the case
has been handed over to the prosecutor. That is a good
thing; they will now probably be less worried and the time
they will be kept locked up will be shorter. Perhaps your
request to have them released on bail will be granted.
Surely they will not keep them in prison now that the
investigation is over—that is hardly likely.

As regards our acquaintances in St. Petersburg things
are pretty bad. There does not seem to be anybody left
there, with the possible exception of one old
friend[2]

whom
you know and whose wife visited you in Moscow when
Yelizaveta Vasilyevna was at your place. But he is not

    

much use. Nadya has an old friend, Apollinariya Ivanovna
Knipovich, Peterburgskaya Storona, Bolshoi Prospekt,
No. 42, Apt. No. 16—although I do not know whether you
can hope to get her to go bail. I will, however, write to
her and if you are in St. Petersburg you can call on her.

We are still living as before. The weather here is a little
better now, after a long period of rain, and we are making
use of it for long walks in the beautiful country round about;
since we did not manage to go away anywhere for the
summer we have to take what chances we have! Yelizaveta
Vasilyevna is now recovering and feels much better. She
sends you and everybody her best regards, so does Nadya.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health—and also that our people will soon be released. Write
and let me know when you have made arrangements for the
winter. Is it not cold in that summer cottage by now?

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

February 26, 1902

I am sending you Nadya’s
letter,[1]

Mother dearest. I
have received your letter and Manya’s of January 31. Thank
Mitya for taking on the job of forwarding the books.

Anyuta also wrote to me about Mark’s plan. Well,
Harbin, I think, is not so very far away now and it will soon
be nearer—when the line is opened. Anyway, Mark will
probably not have to stay there very long. And if he cannot
find something to do anywhere else—well, doing nothing
is the worst possible thing. Give him very best regards
from us all and tell him that we hope he will soon return
from his distant wanderings.

Y.V. is now quite well. She sends you her best wishes
and the same to Manyasha, Mitya and Mark. She intends
going to Russia soon; I do not know whether she will or
not, but she is talking seriously about it.

I thank Manyasha again for the books; I have received
them all. Gorky, Volume 5, we have (quite by chance).
Let her convey our very best wishes to the inhabitant of
“the neighbouring
farmstead”[2]

;

I am very glad that an
old friend has turned up, the one with whom we spent many
excellent evenings. I hope to write him a long letter soon.

I wrote in the last letter that I like your
group[3]

very
much.

Many kisses, my dear. Hoping you are well.

Yours,

V. U.

March 24, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

It is quite a while since I last received any news of you.
How are you? We have recently been having perfect spring
weather—people go out in summer coats or even without
them. There has been no winter at all this year, I should
say, though I expect winter is still with you even now in
Russia. In Samara, I suppose, the snow is now melting
and the time of impassable mud or puddles hidden
under the snow is
beginning.[1]

What have you in mind for the summer? It would be a
good thing if you could get away from town, at least as
far as the Zhiguli Hills if you cannot go any further (as I
hope you will be able to). How are you keeping now, my
dear? In spring, I suppose, all sorts of colds and other
illnesses are going around your way too.

What does the future hold in store for Mark? Anyuta
writes that instead of Manchuria he is now counting
on getting a job somewhere on the Volga. Did he get the
job, and where does he intend to live?

I have not had any letters from Mitya either and do not
know whether he is in Moscow, or in the south, or how
matters stand with his job.

What about Manyasha? Is she still working for the
Zemstvo council? She, too, will have to get away from Samara
in summer—I still cannot forget how foul it is in the
heat.

We are also thinking of where to go in summer, although
the towns here in summer are quite different from those of
Russia.

I sometimes see Russian magazines—far from all of them
and not regularly either. How do you people like Veresayev’s

    

new story in Mir Bozhy? At first I expected a lot, but I am
not very pleased with the continuation.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send best regards
to Manyasha and all acquaintances.

Yours,

V. U.

April 2, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

I received Manyasha’s letter only a little while ago.
Thank her very much. A few days ago I wrote you that I
have had no news of you for a long time. I even started
sending Anyuta letters asking about you.

As regards books—please tell Manyasha not to send
them until I let you have a new
address.[3] I am grateful
to her for sorting out the books; the only German books
I should like to receive are those that are not needed (and
not even likely to be needed) in Russia by you or by
acquaintances. That is because I can easily get German
books here, there is no shortage of them. But there is a
shortage of Russian books, so please, could all possible
Russian books be picked out and even all the statistics and
put in a separate box, for I am beginning to miss these
things and am thinking of having them all sent. I am
particularly grateful to Manyasha for putting in some
Russian classics.


How are you keeping now, my dear? Are you still
thinking of a trip abroad in summer? It would be excellent,
if it would not tire you too much.

Best regards to Mark. Has he at last received permission
to leave?

What about the
“doctor”[1]

in Manchuria? I really should

    

very much like to correspond with him. Hasn’t his address
been discovered yet?

Has Manyasha conveyed my best regards to the “old
acquaintance” whom I used to visit at the
farmstead?[2]

I was very glad to have news of him.

Manyasha should also have a holiday in
summer—somewhere in the Zhiguli Hills, eh?

I embrace you fondly, my dear; regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

May 8, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received a postcard with a view of the
Volga and with congratulations from Manyasha. Many
thanks for it. I do not know whether you have been receiving
my letters regularly lately. I have had nothing from you
except that postcard for quite a while.

Do you correspond with Y.V. who is now in St. Petersburg
and does not seem to like it very much and is thinking
of coming back?

I am hoping to see you soon, my
dear.[1] I hope the
journey will not tire you too greatly. You absolutely must
choose day trains and spend the nights in hotels. Hotels
abroad are not expensive and you can spend a comfortable
night in one. It is quite impossible to travel for several
days without a rest because of the speed of the trains here
and of the short stops.

I am anxiously awaiting news of your departure. Perhaps
you will send a telegram from Russia, or from somewhere
abroad, when you board the train that will actually bring
you here. That would be much more convenient.

I wanted to ask you to bring some of the clothes I left
behind, but now I think it is not worth while; the things
I left behind must have come in handy for Mitya and it is
not worth the trouble of buying new things in Russia and
bringing them here. If there is anything left that is of no
use to anyone else, you could bring it (not much, of course,
so as not to overburden you).
 

I advise you to take express trains in Germany and
Austria (the extra fare in the third class is small but the time
gained is tremendous), and buy Hendschel’s Telegraph and
draw up a timetable before you leave home. Manyasha, for
instance, is probably familiar with that directory.

I embrace you fondly, my dear; best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

June 7, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

I have received a letter from Manyasha and am very
grateful to her. With regard to an address for the despatch
of books, I will try and send it soon. It is a great pity that
you still have to be bothered with this burden! Well, we
shall put an end to all that soon and you will be rid of
all the books.

We are all expecting you, my dear, and I am
corresponding with Anyuta regarding her plans—how and where to
make arrangements for you to stay. The weather seems to
be continuing fine, here and where Anyuta
lives.[1]

Yelizaveta Vasilyevna writes that she will probably be leaving
soon; she does not seem to be very well pleased with her
trip (I, incidentally, tried all the time to talk her out of it,
showing her that there was no need for her to go and that
she would soon be missing us).

I do not write about my health because I am quite well.
Nadya, too.

What about Mark and his job? Did he take the position
in Tomsk and when is he going there?

Manya’s tale of her boat trip made me very envious....
How I should like to be on the Volga in summer! What
a fine time you and Anyuta and I had on the boat in the
spring of
1900.[2] If I cannot get to the Volga, the Volga

    

people must come here. There are some nice places here, too,
although of a different kind.


Au revoir, my dear.

Your V. embraces you fondly.

P. S. I received the Gorky and Skitalets books and read
them with very great interest. I have read them myself
and passed them on to others.

September 14, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

We were all extremely glad to receive your telegram
and later your postcard. Did you continue your journey
comfortably? Wasn’t it too tiring? Please drop me a couple
of lines about this when you have rested and have settled
down a bit.

Anyuta’s photographs (the ones she sent, I mean) arrived
in good time and in good
condition.[1]

There have been no changes here. We are all well. The
weather here is surprisingly fine for autumn—it must be
compensation for a bad summer. Nadya and I have often
been out locally in search of “real countryside” and have
found it.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send my very best
regards to Manyasha and Anya.

Yours,

V. U.

September 27, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

It is quite a while since I heard from you. I still do not
know what sort of journey you had to Samara and how
you are fixed up there. I doubt whether Manyasha is still
living at the old address but I am writing there since I
have no other and expect that the letter will be forwarded to
her. Where is Anyuta? What news have you had from Mitya
and Mark? What are you thinking of doing for the winter?

Are you well, my dear? Was the journey not too tiring?

Life goes on as usual; the only thing is that we have
recently been a little busier. I have now got into a more
regular way of life, but try to spend more time in the
library.

The weather is extraordinarily fine—our reward for a
dreadful summer. Nadya and I have travelled and walked
round a great deal of the surrounding country and have
found some very nice places. If you are having the same
kind of weather you should take advantage of it somewhere
in the country, because I expect there is little pleasure to be
had from living in Samara itself, even at this time of the year.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to all from Nadya, Y.V. and me.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

November 9, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

I received your letter quite a long time ago but have
somehow been unable to get down to answering it; and
anyway I have been expecting an answer to my previous
letter. Mitya’s
release[2]—in my last letter I wrote that I
was sure of it—actually took place much quicker than
I expected. I am particularly glad for Anyuta’s sake,
because she has not had to spend a long time hanging about
various government offices (often an extremely unpleasant
business, even more unpleasant than being in prison!) and
has at last been able to go to Mark. She had been wandering
from place to place without a home of her own, so to speak,
for much too long.

What news is there now from her? Is Mark satisfied with
his job? Does Mitya earn anything, and is he thinking
of visiting you? I hope you are keeping well, my dear.

As for us, we are going on as usual and do nothing
exciting. The weather is warm, similar to our August weather;
even in a summer coat it is hot (of course people are von
unten warm
angezogen,[1]

in the jerseys they wear abroad).
I have got fairly well used to the local way of life and am
acquiring a practical command of the language. Y.V. is
now well and does not get ill very often. Nadya gets a little
tired, but in general is reasonably well.
 

Not long ago I received some new Russian books such
as Zheleznov’s (Politicheskaya ekonomiya) but have had no
time to read them. I was not very pleased with them when
I glanced through them. I read mostly Moscow, newspapers—
still the same old thing. I see the local papers in
readingrooms.

How are you keeping, in general, this winter?

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best
regards to all.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

December 17, 1902


Mother dearest,

A few days ago we received Manyasha’s letter to Nadya
with your postscript and I was very glad to hear from you
because there had been no news for a long time. There
was also a short letter from Anyuta; she seems to be well
content with her new place. Manyasha writes that you will
soon be seeing Mitya and his
wife.[1]

Give him very best
regards from me and all of us. Perhaps Anyuta will visit
you, too, and you will all be together for a short while
during the holidays. That would be fine.




Our life here goes on just the same as usual. It was cold
for a few weeks (cold here means “not thawing”) but there
was no snow and we all caught colds. But we are all right
now. The weather is again wet—at this rate I shall soon
get unused to our winter!

I see from Manyasha’s letter that she liked Zheleznov’s
book. I have not read it, of course; I merely turned over
the pages, and so cannot undertake to judge. When I have
read it, I will write about it. What I wrote concerned only
the first, superficial impression.

Manyasha also writes that she has taken up languages,
even English. I thought of sending her a textbook on
pronunciation, a very good one, in German. I have been doing
some study lately and am very pleased with the book;

    

I can’t praise it enough. The book is, Henry Sweet,
Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch, Oxford, 1901, and it
costs something like a ruble twenty-five kopeks. If
Manyasha would like me to, I can send it; I do not need it any
more. Since she has Toussaint, however, I don’t know
whether it is worth while, because Toussaint is excellent.
I used not to believe in this system but now I am sure it
is the only serious, efficient system. If you take a few
lessons from a native foreigner after working through the first
part of Toussaint you can certainly acquire a thorough
knowledge of the language. There are Toussaint dictionaries now
as well, in which the pronunciation is indicated; I strongly
advise Manyasha to buy them because our Alexandrov is
wrong in many cases. (For instance, I strongly advise her to
buy Muret’s pocket dictionary that uses the Toussaint
method, Taschenwörterbuch der englischen und deutschen
Sprache, Teil I, Englisch-deutsch, Preis 2 Mark. ,Berlin, 1902.
Langenscheidtsche Verlagsbuchhandlung.)

Well, I have used up a lot of paper talking about books....
I want to order Problemy idealizma—this seems to be a
“militant” review by the nonsense-mongering
gentlemen.[2]

Y.V. and Nadya send their regards. I hope you will soon
be receiving visitors and have some relief from your
loneliness.

I embrace you fondly, my dear.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

December 26, 1902 
 

Mother dearest,

Please send the enclosed letter to Anyuta; I have not
got her address, I must have lost it (I have not yet written
her a single letter) and perhaps she is not in Tomsk now,
but with you. I believe you were hoping you would all be
together for the holidays, Mitya as well. Write and tell
me whether it turned out that way, and whether you made
the acquaintance of Mitya’s wife.

We still have absolutely nothing new to tell you. The
cold is over and we now have what we would call autumn
weather; by way of exception it is dry, and this is very
pleasant. The holidays here will probably be rather boring—
few meetings, the reading-rooms closed and the theatres
all overcrowded and difficult to get into. However, I am
hoping to see some new acquaintances during this period.

I have recently been reading the German newspapers
more than usual; there have been some interesting
happenings in Germany and sometimes I wanted to get the story
straight from the source. Things seem to be quieting down
there,
too.[1]

How are you getting on? Are the worst frosts over? Have
you any new acquaintances?

Hoping you will have a good time this holiday and will
all keep well.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

February 4, 1903

Mother dearest,

It is a very long time since I received as much as a single
letter from you or any of our people. One of your letters
must have gone astray, because I cannot believe that
nobody has written to me all this time. I don’t know whether
Mitya came to visit you, whether he stayed for long, what
his plans are, and where he is now. Have you had any news of
Anyuta, did she move to Port
Arthur[1] and when? Are you
well? Is the weather in Russia really still as cold as ever?

The weather here is fine. It has been an exceptionally
good mild winter, with very little rain or fog (so far).
Y. V., it is true, still gets ill rather often; she is ill now
but not very badly, so we are making do with home
treatment and Russian remedies. It would probably be good
for her to move somewhere further south. Nadya and I are
both well and are jogging along as usual. We recently
went to our first concert this winter and were very pleased
with it—especially with Chaikovsky’s latest symphony
(Symphonic pathétique). Are there any good concerts in
Samara? We went once to a German theatre but what we
should like would be to visit the Russian Art Theatre and
see The Lower Depths.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you everything
of the best, especially health. Regards to all; perhaps you
will forward the letter to Anyuta. Otherwise, when shall
I learn her address?

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Have I got your address right?

February 22, 1903 
 

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter, for which a big merci. It
was very interesting to hear about Anyuta. By the way,
please send her this letter as I do not know her address.
It is true she recently sent me a brief note for which I am
very grateful, but she forgot to say anything about her
address and, in general, she was so hazy about everything
that I am completely bewildered. I learned about the
“Chinese”
philistines[1]

only from you. In a way, that is closer
to Europe, or to the New World! Rather interesting, I
think, very much so, in fact!

I am very, very sorry about the old
friend.[2]


Would it not be quicker to correspond with the Chinese
lady through Japan or through some British port? True
enough, it is farther by sea, but the Europeans are many
times more punctual!

Life here goes on as usual. Nothing particularly good
has happened and nothing bad either, and in general I
feel much less
veberarbeitet[3]

than before. I expect to 
 take a trip to Germany in a few
days.[4] The weather is
astonishingly fine, it is hot in a light coat; sunshine and a
warm, warm breeze.... Just right for walking.
 

How are you getting on? Where are Mitya and his wife?
How is Manyasha?

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Best regards to all, especially to Anya and Mark!

Lenin wrote about Germany for purposes of secrecy. In February
1903 he went to Paris to lecture at the Russian Social Sciences
Higher School there; between February 23 and 26 he delivered
four  lectures on  “Marxist  Views on  the  Agrarian  Problem in

   

Europe and in Russia”. (In the Central Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism, C.C., C.P.S.U., there are two
variants of a plan of these lectures in the form of notes.) Early
in March Lenin spoke at a meeting of Russian political émigrés
in Paris on the agrarian programme of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Social-Democrats. He returned to London on March 9.

March 29, 1903 
 

Mother dearest,

I received your letter a few days ago—a big merci for it.
So Anyuta has been delayed in the Far East longer than she
expected. I thought she would be with you by now. Still,
I suppose a long journey like that requires some
preparation. Mitya, too, it seems, has not yet decided on where he
is going to live. Is poor Manyasha very lonesome?

I am glad it is warmer now in Samara, because very cold
winters are extremely tiring. Are you now feeling
better, my dear?

It is warm here. We recently took Y.V. on a long outing too
—we took sandwiches with us instead of lunch and spent
the whole of one Sunday ins Grüne (quite unintentionally
we are taking to foreign ways and arrange our outings
on Sundays of all days, though that is the worst time
because everywhere is crowded). We had a long walk, the
air went to our heads as if we were children and afterwards
I had to lie down and rest, as I did after a shooting trip
in Siberia. In general, we do not miss a chance to go on
outings. We are the only people among the comrades here
who are exploring every bit of the surrounding country.
We discover various “rural” paths, we know all the places
nearby and intend to go further afield. I have been feeling
very well lately, I work regularly and do not worry about
the commotion around me. Nadya and Y.V. are also well.

I embrace you fondly, my dear. Please write from time to
time (or ask Manyasha to) about yourselves and your plans.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

January 8, 1904 
 

Mother dearest,

I forgot to reply to Manyasha about the 150 rubles she
was enquiring about. Let them remain with you, for the
time being at any rate. I would, however, ask you to buy
a few books with some of the money. I have already
written about a Russian-French Dictionary. To this I should
like to add Sechenov’s Elementy mysli (a recently
published book).

A few days ago I had a wonderful outing to Salève with
Nadya and a
friend.[1]

Down below in Geneva it was all mist
and gloom, but up on the mountain (about 4,000 feet above
sea level) there was glorious sunshine, snow, tobogganing—
altogether a good Russian winter’s day. And at the foot
of the mountain—la mer du brouillard, a veritable sea
of mist and clouds, concealing everything except the
mountains jutting up through it, and only the highest at that.
Even little Salève (nearly 3,000 feet) was wrapped in mist.

So we are beginning to get to know Switzerland and
its scenery. In the spring we intend to make a long walking
tour.

I embrace you fondly, my dear. Are you keeping well?
How are you?

I am glad that you are feeling a little more at ease—
the main thing is for our detainees to keep
well.[1] In
view of the large number of arrests they may simply
have been caught in the dragnet....

Send me Mark Timofeyevich’s address, I shall have some

My address: Geneva, Chemin privé du Foyer, 10.

July 2

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

We received Manyasha’s letter the day before yesterday
and yours yesterday. How glad I was! If only they will soon
release Anya! I embrace you fondly, my dears. It is such
a pity that you are both suffering from ill health. You
absolutely must take a rest—the main thing is to get your
lungs filled with fresh air; after all, Kiev is a city. The
only thing is that in the north the summer is bad; Mother
is living near St. Petersburg at the country house of some
friends and complains of the terrible cold and the rain.
I believe that there is everything conducive to rest at
M.T.’s country place.

We are now on holiday, too. We have let our house and
I am very glad we have, because keeping it clean and
housekeeping in general took the whole day, there was
sometimes such a hubbub at our place; the need to think
about housekeeping all the time was a nuisance. If you go
out for a walk, you are left without milk, if you are not up
by seven o’clock you have the pleasure of going to town
for meat, and so on. And in winter it was so cold. We
shall now find something more convenient. In general I
am dreaming of autumn, when I shall be able to sit down
and work seriously. I am thinking of various ways of
avoiding the constant turmoil; it is terribly tiring. We are now
in Lausanne. It is already a week since we got away from
Geneva and are now resting in the full sense of the word.
We have left our work and our worries in Geneva and here

    

we sleep 10 hours a day, and go swimming and walking—
Volodya does not even read the newspapers properly; we
took a minimum of books with us, and even those we are
sending back to Geneva tomorrow, unread, while we ourselves
shall don our rucksacks at four in the morning and set out
for a two weeks’ walking tour in the
mountains.[1] We
shall go to Interlaken and from there to Lucerne. We are
reading Baedeker and planning our journey carefully. In
a week we have “recovered” quite considerably and have
even begun to look healthy again. It has been a difficult
winter and our nerves have been under such a strain that
we cannot be blamed for taking a month’s holiday, although
I am already feeling guilty about it. The weather is a
bit doubtful, there is no rain, but the air is rather misty.
For the time being that is all I have to write about us.
Volodya and I have made an agreement not to talk about
our work—work, he says, is not a bear and will not escape
to the woods—not even to mention it, and, as far as possible,
not to think about it.

I shall be writing to Manyasha, probably this evening,
and in the meantime I embrace all of you fondly, my dears,
and send you many kisses.

Yours,

Nadya

Mother dearest,

I will add just a few words. Very best regards to Manyasha
and congratulations on her release. This summer you
absolutely must rest. Please go and stay in the country
somewhere. We are taking walks and having a good holiday.
I embrace you.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Krupskaya recalls the following in connection with this holiday.

“At the end of June 1904, Vladimir Ilyich and I took our
rucksacks and set off for a month in the mountains, following our
noses. We spent a week or so in Lausanne to muster a little strength,
and then set out for somewhere beyond Montreux; we found our
way through the wildest forests to a place where some loggers told
us how to reach the road and where to spend the night. Through
Aigle we descended into the valley of the Rhone, went to
Bex-les-Bains to an old school and college friend of mine, and
then wandered along the Rhone for a long time—about 70 versts;
this was the most tiring part of the journey. In the end we crossed
the Gemmi Pass into Oberland, reached the foot of the Jungfrau,
and then, with our legs aching and completely worn out, we stayed
at Iseltwald on the Brienzersee for about a week and from there
again took to the road through Interlaken and Zimmental back
to the Geneva area. The winter of 1903–04 had been a particularly
difficult one, our nerves were in a bad state and we wanted to
get away from people and forget for the time being all business
and alarms. The mountains helped us. The changing impressions,
the mountain air, solitude, healthy tiredness and healthy sleep
were a real cure for Vladimir Ilyich. His strength and vivacity
and high spirits returned to him. In August we lived on Lac de
Bret, where Vladimir Ilyich and Bogdanov evolved a plan for
the further struggle against the Mensheviks.”

August 28, 1904 
 

Mother dearest,

I have not written to you for a long time because I was
not certain of your address. Today we received letters
from Y.V. and Manyasha. Thank her for the trouble she
has taken over the translations. Nadya will write about
this in detail. I have now received Hobson’s book on
imperialism and have begun translating
it[1]—only a little
at a time because I am still enjoying the summer way of
life—walking, swimming and lazing around. Altogether,
I have had an excellent rest this summer!

What about you? Is the cottage at Sablino a good one?
Are you having a good rest? What is the outlook for the
future? Are you keeping well? How are Anyuta and
Manyasha after their imprisonment? Drop me a line about this
because Manyasha only speaks about translations.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send regards to all.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Have I got the address right? If you change it, let me
know in good time. My address: Rue de la Colline, 3, Geneve,
but on the envelope you absolutely must write: V. I.
Ulyanov, Personal.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to Hobson’s Imperialism, published in 1902. There
is no printed edition of Lenin’s translation of the book in
existence and the manuscript of the translation has been lost.

June 27, 1907 
 

Mother dearest,

For a long time I have not written you anything. Anyuta
has probably told you of our plans for a holiday. I came
back terribly tired. I have now completely recovered. Here
you can have a wonderful rest, swimming, walking, no
people and no
work.[1] No people and no work—that is the
best thing for me. I expect to be here another fortnight
or so and then to return to work. Nadya and her mother
are well and are having a good holiday.

How are you all fixed up there? Are you well? Have
you seen Anyuta? Where is she? With you now, or with
Mark? When you can, drop me a line or ask Mitya to.

I embrace you fondly,


Yours,


V. Ul.

Regards from me to Mitya and his wife.

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

Volodya does not usually send regards and so I send
regards to you from Mother and myself. We also send regards
to all our people. I can confirm the fact that we are having
a good rest; we have all put on so much weight it’s not
decent to show ourselves in public.... Here there is a pine
forest, sea, magnificent weather, in short, everything is
excellent. It is also a good thing that there is no
housekeeping to do. And what sort of a rest are you having? How

    

is your malaria? Have you got rid of it completely? Do
you go mushrooming? How are you, in general, and what
are you doing? Here we are cut off from the whole world;
although there is a post six times a week nobody writes
anything. Once again I embrace you fondly.

Yours,

Nadya

Dear Manyasha,

Thanks for the letter. I must apologise for not answering
at once. I have got so “embedded” in summer holidays
and in loafing (I am having a rest such as I have not had
for several years) that I am still postponing all business
matters, great and small.

I am against boycotting the Third Duma; I have been
writing a little piece on this subject which will probably
soon be
out.[2] In my opinion that slogan must not be
revived unless there is a situation of heightened political
activity, unless there is a struggle against early
constitutional illusions. Any fresh burst of enthusiasm (there
may be one on account of the July strike of Moscow
textile workers—up to 400,000 are expected to strike) must
be expanded, preparations must be made, it must be made
general, but it would be out of place to declare a boycott.
We must not renounce the slogan altogether; if the situation
arises we shall, in a moment of political upsurge, propose
a boycott. To declare a boycott at the moment would be
either premature bravado or the uncritical repetition of
slogans that have a glorious revolutionary past. Such, in
a few words, is my argument; it is developed in detail in
the
press.[1]

 

Write and tell me how you are fixed up and whether you
are satisfied. Best regards to Mark and all acquaintances.

We are having a wonderful rest and are loafing.

Many kisses,


Yours,


V. U.

Darling Manyasha,

I am adding a few words. There is nothing to
write about since we are, at the moment, “outside public
interests” and are leading a holiday life—bathing in the
sea, cycling (the roads are bad, by the way, so you can’t
go far). Volodya plays chess, fetches water, at one time we
had a craze for the English game of “Donkey”, and so on.
The only thing is that Lidya has a lot of bother with the
housekeeping.... Everybody here is putting on weight
splendidly. We could read a lot but none of the books here are
very suitable and anyway we don’t feel like reading.

Many kisses,


Yours,


N.

Our people (Lidya and Mother) send regards, of course.

October 15, 1907 
 

Mother dearest,

It is a long time since I wrote to you. I believe the last
letter was the one I sent from my summer Mon Repos.
We have now settled down to family life for the winter
in the old
place.[3] We hope the winter will not be as cold as
the last. But we shall arrange things better now and
“batten down the hatches”. I am very pleased with the premises
and with the way things have been fixed up. Manyasha
has been staying with us and is still here, but she intends
leaving today because winter is setting in; the first snow
fell today and it has turned cold.

How are you getting along there? Will it be all right
in the country when the real cold sets in? Please convey my
best regards to Mitya. It was a pity I could not visit him
in the
autumn,[4] we could have had some magnificent
shooting, the weather was splendid all the time. When is
he getting his holiday, for how long, and where is he going?

I have had a couple of letters from Anyuta. She seems
to be pleased with her
trip.[1]

The route is an interesting
one and it will probably be very fine down south now.

Here we are living in a small company of good
friends.[2]


 We have books and work. We take walks along the

    

seashore. I think Manyasha felt very well here; she worked a
lot, translating.

Nearly all of us recently paid tribute to autumn—with
a dose of influenza for a couple of days. Now we are all
well or convalescent. Yelizaveta Vasilyevna also feels quite
well—only she sometimes gets too worried over the
housekeeping.

I embrace and kiss you, my dear. I hope you will keep
well.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Russia

January 14, 1908 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I am sending you the copy of
Obrazovaniye[4] that I
brought with me by mistake. I don’t think I owe you any
more books, do I? If I do, please let me know.

We have been hanging about in this damned Geneva for
several days
now[5].... It is an awful hole, but there is
nothing we can do. We shall get used to it. How are you?
Are you freezing? Is Mother well? Please kiss her for me
and give my regards to Anyuta, and to Mitya, too, if he
has not yet left.

Yesterday I wrote to Lev Borisovich about an
article[1]

and asked him to obtain for me the minutes of the Third
Duma (the officially published verbatim reports and also
the announcements, questions and bills brought before the
Duma). These can only be obtained through acquaintances.
Please make an effort to see that someone agrees to get them
for me, and send them all, missing nothing. Please send
me also all the trade union journals that are still being
published in Russia (in St. Petersburg, and Moscow as well)
—buy them immediately. From the sum I am to receive from
the publisher on January 4, please get 50 rubles from

    

Yelizaveta Vasilyevna and send me everything new that
the Mensheviks publish (if they do) and so on. I have
ordered Tovarishch (Nash
Vek)[6] for myself from January 1
and will also keep track of new publications. If L.B. is
too lazy or too busy to write, please find out his answer
(to my questions) and let me know. By the way, I need an
answer about Granat (History of Russia); has a contract
for my
article[7] been concluded with him or has it fallen
through? Let L.B. reconnoitre and inform you.

All the very best,


Yours,

Obrazovaniye (Education)—a monthly literary, popular scientific,
social and political journal published legally in St. Petersburg
from 1892 to 1909. Articles by Social-Democrats were published
in the journal between 1902 and 1908.





[5]
After the defeat of the First Russian Revolution, Lenin was hunted
by the tsarist police and had to leave Kuokkala in November 1907
and move to Oggelby (near Helsingfors). In accordance with the
decision of the Bolshevik centre to transfer the publication of the
newspaper Proletary to Geneva, Lenin  left Oggelby. He stayed
in Stockholm for a few days and arrived in Geneva on January 7,
1908. This was his second period of exile abroad, which lasted
until April 1917.





[6]
Tovarishch (Comrade)—a bourgeois daily published in St.
Petersburg from March 15 (28), 1906 to December 30, 1907 (January 12,
1908), actually as the organ of the Left Cadets. Nash Vek (Our
Age) was published in January 1908 in place of Tovarishch.





[7]
The article referred to is Lenin’s “The Agrarian Question in
Russia Towards the Close of the Nineteenth Century”, which he wrote
for the Granat   Brothers  Encyclopaedic  Dictionary.   Because of
the censorship the article could not be published at that time.
It first appeared in 1918 in pamphlet form (see Collected Works,
Vol. 15, pp. 69–147).

January 22, 1908 
 

Mother dearest,

Today I received a letter from you and Manya and
hasten to reply. I was very glad to receive news from you
direct—I have not received any of Manyasha’s earlier
letters. We had to resort to forwarding letters until we arrived
in Geneva and it was a nuisance.

We were greatly worried at the news of Anyuta’s bad
attack of influenza. Your apartment must be a bad one
(Nadya says it is damp), if there are such complications.
Are you all well now? How is Mitya? Has he gone away
again in connection with his work?

We are now settling down here and our arrangements,
of course, will not be worse than before. The only
unpleasant thing was the actual moving, which was a change
for the worse. That, however, was inevitable. About Capri—
as soon as I arrived I found a letter from Gorky, who very
insistently invites me there. Nadya and I have made up
our minds to accept that invitation and take a trip to Italy
(in Capri now the narcissi are in bloom, so the Gorkys
write), but not yet. All our affairs must be settled first and
then we can travel.

I wrote to Manyasha yesterday or the day before with
further requests for books. Am I giving her too many orders?

I embrace you, my dear, and hope you are quite well.
Regards to all from Nadya and myself.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov
 

Dear everybody,

What a rotten time you have had with this damned
influenza! Perhaps it’s because the flat is damp? I am
glad you are getting better.... Many kisses for all of you;
I hope you will soon recover and get your strength back
completely.

Yours,

Nadya

Dear Manyasha,

I have received your letter of January 20, a letter from
the young writer on the same subject, and today I received
Rech.[2] I am very, very grateful for the newspaper, the
article is really extremely interesting!

With regard to Webb—I have written to the young
writer and have sent him something in the nature of power
of attorney. In any case I repeat (1) I do not know how
many copies of the first edition there were; (2) Struve was
the manager of the editorial office at that time and he edited
the first volume; (3) the second volume was translated by
Y. Smirnov (Gurevich). I then received 20 rubles for a
printer’s signature for the translation of the first volume and
10 rubles a signature for editing the second. Let the young
writer haggle—if need be, let him go down to a half of that,
provided the contract is concluded for a definite number
of copies.

Yesterday I also received a letter from a colleague about
Granat. Things are working out quite well for me there.

As regards our marriage lines and the palm oil wanted
in Krasnoyarsk, I propose that you should not take too
much trouble or give any large quantity of palm oil. It
looks as if we shall manage without it.
 

In a month, if not sooner, we intend to set up our own
apartment here.

With regard to the symposium in memory of Marx, it
does not seem likely that I shall take part in it, either;
such things cannot be written in a
hurry.[3]

Our people are taking a surprisingly long time to get
well! It’s too bad. The influenza this year must be
particularly malignant, or else you are having very bad weather.
Write and tell me how Mother is.

I have not yet fully settled down here—for instance,
I have not yet joined my “club”, where it is convenient
to read periodicals and easy to obtain new
books.[4] I
shall try (as soon as I have joined—probably in a day or
two) to find whatever I can for you to translate. Do you
receive Neue Zeit? In the science supplement to No. 1 there
is an article by Kautsky “Nationalität und
Internationalist”. I have not yet seen it. Is it not suitable for
translation? I have read Kautsky’s Sozialismus und
Kolonialpolitik (a new pamphlet of 80 pages). I think it would be
permitted. Talk to
Zerno[1]
[5]

about it; it would be a good thing
to translate it. I am also surprised that no announcement
is to be seen of a translation of Parvus’s Kolonialpolitik und
Zusammenbruch. Has no one any initiative? Ask Zerno.
I could get in touch with the author here, abroad.

All the best, kiss Mother for me.

Yours,


V. Ulyanov

P.S. I have not received Bench’s Selected Works.

Of the trade union journals I have received Gudok and
Tekstilnoye delo. In future please send all such
publications.

 
Notes
 

[1]
Please ask them at the same time whether I may send new things
for you to their address, things that may be suitable for translation.—Lenin
 



[2]
Rech (Speech)—organ of the   Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet)
Party published daily in St. Petersburg. Lenin probably referred
to Rech No. 12 of January 15 (28), 1908, which carried an article
entitled   “Resolution   of   the   Baku   Social-Democrats   Against
Expropriation and Terror”.





[3]
Lenin nevertheless wrote an article for the symposium Karl Marx
(1818–1883), entitled “Marxism and Revisionism” (see Collected
Works, Vol. 15, pp. 29–39).





[4]
The club referred to is the Société de lecture (Reading Society)
in Geneva; to work in the reading-room it was necessary to be a
member of it and pay a certain fee. Lenin had worked there in
1904–05, before he left for Russia.





[5]
Zerno (Grain or The Seed) was a publishing house headed by
M. S. Kedrov; in 1907 it launched the publication of a collection
of Lenin’s works under the general title of Twelve Years. It was
planned as a three-volume edition but only the first volume and
Part I of the second appeared. Volume I appeared in November
1907 (the date on the cover was 1908) and was confiscated soon
after its appearance, although a large part of this first printing
was saved and was distributed illegally.

Zerno published a symposium on the twenty-fifth anniversary
of Marx’s death and the Kalendar dlya vsekh (Calendar for All)
for 1908, which carried Lenin’s article “The International
Socialist Congress in Stuttgart” (see Collected Works, Vol. 13, pp. 82-
93).

February 14, 1908 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I recently wrote to you about some translations. I should
now like to add that I have read Ergänzungsheft No. 1 to
Neue Zeit—an article by Kautsky “Nationalität und
Internationalität”. I remember you said you receive Neue Zeit,
so I shall not send it from here (give me an address to which
I can send foreign books and articles, in case I need it).
In my opinion this is a thing that can be published legally
and is really worth translating. Propose it to the publisher
(36 pages). The best thing of all would be to publish it (it
is a criticism of Bauer) with the book by Otto Bauer, Die
Nationalitätenfrage und die Sozialdemokratie (Anya
probably has this book since she translated one chapter of it).

One of my colleagues here wants someone to ask the
publisher whether he would undertake to publish Huschke’s
Landwirtschaftliche Reinertragsberechnungen, which I
quoted in Part I of my Agrarian
Question.[1] If an opportunity
occurs, ask the publisher and I will promise to write a
preface. But if the truth be told, it is too highly specialised
a book....




I had a talk with the Director of the Police Department
yesterday about my Acte de mariage. It seems that it is
necessary. Ask some lawyer of your acquaintance to think
of some other way of getting a copy from Krasnoyarsk
(because probably no great hopes are to be placed in “palm
oil”). There does exist some (legal) procedure which makes

    

it possible to obtain proof of marriage. Cannot Yelizaveta
Vasilyevna apply to a justice of the peace or to the relevant
authority in St. Petersburg and demand from him an
instruction to issue a certificate to her requiring the
Krasnoyarsk church authorities to supply her with a copy of the
marriage lines (either for legal action against her daughter,
or in connection with the disposal of an inheritance, etc.).
Is it not possible by some such means to obtain the
certificate or a copy of it? Ask a lawyer.




How is everybody? Have Mother and Anyuta fully
recovered?

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

P.S. Very, very many thanks for the minutes of the Third
Duma. I ask you most urgently to continue sending them,
to send more often and to send them together with bills
and questions.

Dear Manyasha,

Please send me the following books:

1. Minuvshiye Gody No. 1 (January, price 85 kopeks)
containing letters from Marx to Mikhailovsky and from
Mikhailovsky to Lavrov.

2.Materialy k istorii russkoi kontrrevolyutsii, Vol. 1.

4. Lokot. Byudzhetnaya i podatnaya politika Rossii.
1 ruble.

5. Almazov. Nasha Revolyutsiya (1902-7). 1 ruble 50
kopeks (work)—I do not know whether this last-named
book is any use as I have no information about it. All the
same, I must take a look at it!

6. Ocherk zabastovochnogo dvizheniya rabochikh
Bakinskogo neftepromyshlennogo raiona za 1903-6 gg. Baku. 1907.
Price 1 ruble 50 kopeks.




I have not received any Duma minutes of sittings later
than the twentieth. I must have them together with the Bills!
The newspaper Stolichnaya Pochta, for instance, recently
reported the publication of a programme of “a group of
moderate peasants ”. Please get it for me! It would not be bad
to get hold of programmes, announcements and leaflets

    

of the Octobrists, the Rights, the Cossack group, etc., if
you have any Duma contacts. All these “bits of paper”
probably lie about on the floor of the Duma and nobody picks
them up.

I wrote to you a few days ago about translations (of
Kautsky); did you get that
letter?[2]

Did you get the
manuscript of the second part of my Volume
Two[3] (sent from
here on February 5, 1908 N.S. by a roundabout route)?

I shall write to Mother about money.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

If you have an opportunity, please pass on the enclosed
sheet to Meshkovsky. I should like to get a direct address
for correspondence from him and from Lindov. Tell them
that. What was the outcome of Lindov’s “squabble”
with
Bonch[4] and the conflict at the publisher’s on the same
grounds?

 
Notes
 

[1]
If there is an edition containing portraits the best thing would
be to buy that.—Lenin

[2]
See Letters Nos. 160 and 161.—Ed.
 



[3]
The manuscript referred to was that of Lenin’s “The Agrarian
Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution,
1905–1907” written in November and December 1907 (see Collected
Works, Vol. 13, pp. 217–431). It was to have been included in the
second part of Volume 2 of the Lenin collection Twelve Years
but was confiscated by the police and destroyed before leaving
the printers’. Only one copy was saved and several of the end
pages of this were missing. The book was published in part in the
newspaper Proletary No. 33 of July 23 (August 5), 1908. It was
first published in full in 1917.





[4]
In the first edition of Lenin’s Materialism and Empirio-criticism.
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy the word “fideism”
was used instead of popovshchina, a derogatory Russian term
for “clericalism”, although “popovshchina” remained unchanged
in a number of places. Lenin also suggested changing the word
to “Shamanism”; his sister Anna, in a letter dated January 27,
1909, replied by saying, “’Shamanism’ has come too late. Anyway,
is it any better?” The explanatory note was given in the Preface
to the first and subsequent editions (see Collected Works, Vol.
14, p. 19).

March 10, 1908 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I have received your letter of February 21. It really is
terrible that you should have got hold of a damp apartment
and are all so ill. And what a misfortune for Manyasha to
get typhus! Lidiya Mikhailovna writes every day and says
that her temperature is not very high. I am afraid, however,
of taking comfort from this news—there are grave forms
of typhus that are not accompanied by high temperatures.

How is Mother keeping now? If you have no time to write,
ask L. Mikh., since she is the one who writes, to add a couple
of lines.

Mark was actually wrong to leave such a large sum out
of his resettlement allowance, because my publisher now
pays me
enough.[1] It goes without saying that you
absolutely must spend that money to make things easier for
Manyasha and Mother or to help them get away to a better
place. Could they not come here?

I have sent Manyasha a book to translate (a German
novel). Did she get it (from
Leipzig[2])? I also wrote to her
about a book by Anatole France (La vie de Jeanne d’Arc)
and one by Sinclair (Alexinsky suggests they be
translated).

All the best and please give Mother many kisses. Nadya
has gone away on business but asks me to send you her
regards.

Yours,

Vl. Ulyanov

Dear Manyasha,

I hope that by now you will be able to read this yourself
and are almost well again. Your illness has dragged on a
disgustingly long time! The main thing, however, is not
to have a relapse. The most dangerous thing after that
disease is fatigue or nervous excitement. Now would be the time
to send you to
Stjernsund![1]

When you have completely
recovered, drop me a line. I am going to
Italy[2] for a week
or so. I shall write when I get back.


Love and kisses and get well soon.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

June 20, 1908 
 

Mother dearest,

It seems quite a while since I last wrote to you. I think
the last time was a postcard from
London.[2] I arrived back
from there with a bout of abdominal catarrh. I am better
now and have begun to eat properly, and after the diet feel
hungry all the time. I have begun work again.

Life here goes on as usual. The weather is extremely
changeable—one day it is hot, oppressive and stormy and then,
like today, it is rainy and cold. Summer has not yet come
into its own.

How are you getting on in the country? I hope that
Manyasha has completely recovered. We are expecting her here.
Best regards to Mitya.

I embrace you fondly, my dear.


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

P.S. It is a pity that the Moscow
publisher-philosopher[1]

has refused to publish my book. I should like you, if you
can, to write to some of your Moscow literary acquaintances
and ask them whether they can find a publisher. I now have
no contacts in this field.

I have been told that Anyuta read the proofs of the last
part of my agrarian book. I have still not received a single
copy! It is extremely important, for many reasons, for me

    

to obtain two or three copies, even if they are not
stitched.[3]
I realise, of course, that to ask for them direct would
be careless, inconvenient, etc., from all points of view. If
there is the slightest opportunity of doing so privately, or
if Anyuta has even one copy, I ask you to send it to me, at
least for a time. I stand very much in need of it at this
very moment.

Regards from all of us!

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

July 13, 1908 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I have just received your letter with Anyuta’s postscript.
I was very glad to get the news. I was extremely glad to
learn that there is a possibility of its publication in
autumn.[1]

Your St. Petersburg correspondent, however, has forgotten
to answer one of my questions, an important one—is it not
possible to obtain even one copy of the book in printed form,
whether it has been made up or not? If the book is to come
out in the autumn this is not impossible. I am prepared to
pay five or even ten rubles to get a copy now. The point
is that it is absolutely essential for me to show this book,
before autumn, to certain people who cannot read the
manuscript. If I cannot show the book to these people before
autumn, I stand to lose a lot in all respects. And so, since
you have the St. Petersburg address, and the owner of that
address answers you and is closely in touch with the whole
business—I ask you very earnestly to write to him and
enquire, if there is the slightest opportunity, to get me
just one copy, even if it means giving the right person “palm
oil” to the extent of five rubles.

My illness has held up my work on philosophy very
badly. I am now almost well again and will most certainly
write the book. I have been doing a lot of work on the

    

Machists and I think I have sorted out all their inexpressible
vulgarities (and those of “empirio-monism” as
well).[2]


I am writing to M.  Iv-na in Paris and giving her a

recommendation.[3]


Give Mother many kisses for me. Best regards to all. I
keep forgetting to write to tell Anyuta that I have received
340 rubles. So far I do not need money. Best regards to
Mitya, Mark, Anyuta and everybody.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov


P.S. When you or anybody else happens to be in Moscow,
please buy me two books by Chelpanov, (1) Avenarius i
yego shkola and (2) Immanentnaya filosofiya. They cost a
ruble each. Published by Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii.
The two books are issued as part of a series called either
Essays and Research, or simply research, or monographs, or
something of the sort.




Are you having a good rest this summer? The weather
here is fine. I go cycling and bathing. Nadya and Y.V.
send best regards to everyone.

August 9, 1908 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I am sending you a picture of the place I have just
returned from. I went to the mountains for a holiday. The
weather prevented my staying there longer. Nevertheless I
had an excellent holiday. I hope that in about six weeks
my too-long-delayed work will at last be finished. Then
we shall be able to go walking together. I am hoping very
much that you will pay us a long visit in autumn. You
will, won’t you? Of course, you will! It would be wonderful
if Mother could come, too. The weather this summer has
not been good, more rain and thunderstorms than usual.
There is a hope that September will turn out fine here. Do
come!

Maria Ivanovna was here on her way from Paris. We had
a bit of a chat. I visited her last Sunday evening. She spent
a couple of days in Geneva and then went on to Italy. She
was not long in Paris—a fortnight altogether. In general
she is doing her tour abroad in too much of a rush!

Give Mother many, many kisses for me.


Yours,


V. U.

We are all well and all send best regards.


P.S. Vers l’Eglise is not far from
Diablerets.[1] We
did not go there together. It is two and a half hours from
Geneva by rail and about four hours on foot.
 

Notes

P.S. Today I read an amusing newspaper article on the
inhabitants of Mars in connection with a new English book
by Lowell, Mars and Its Canals. Lowell is an astronomer
who has worked for a long time in a special observatory
which, I believe, is the best in the world (in America).

It is a scientific work. It argues that Mars is inhabitable,
that the canals are a miracle of engineering, that people
on that planet must be two and two-thirds the size of our
people here, and that they, furthermore, have trunks and
are covered with feathers or animal skins and have four
or six legs. Hmm... the
author[2]

cheated us by describing
the Martian beauties only in part, according to the
principle that “... the deceit that elevates is dearer to us than
a host of vulgar
truths”.[3]

A new story by Gorky has been published—The Last.

September 30, 1908 
 

Mother dearest,

I have not written to you for a long time; I hoped that
Manyasha would come and tell me about you but her
journey is constantly being postponed. It would be a good
thing if she could come in the second half of October (New
Style) and we could take a trip to Italy together. I am
thinking of taking a week’s holiday when I have finished my
work (it is now drawing to a
close).[1]

On October 11 I shall
be in Brussels for three days and shall return here
afterwards and might think of a trip to
Italy.[2] Why should
not Mitya come here, too? He ought to take a rest after all
his work with the sick. Of course, you must invite him,
too—we could go for some splendid walks together. If there
are money difficulties, you must take the money Anya has
in the bank. I hope I shall now earn a lot.

It would be fine if we could take a trip to the Italian
lakes. They say it is excellent there in the late autumn.
Anyuta will probably come and stay with you soon, so you
can send Manyasha and Mitya.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health.

What is autumn in the country like? Here it is not bad.

    

The summer has been rotten, but now there are occasionally
some real summer days.

All our people here are well and wish me to give you
their best regards.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

October 27, 1908 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I am surprised at your long silence. I suppose the move
to Moscow caused a lot of bother and you have had no time
for letters.

Please give me an address to which I can send the
manuscript of my
book.[1]

It is ready. It amounts to 24 printer’s
signatures (at the rate of 40,000 letters a signature) and
that is about 400 pages. In a fortnight I shall have finished
reading it over and will send it off; I should like to have
a good address to send it to.

Things seem to be bad as far as a publisher is concerned;
I was informed today that Granat has bought the
Mensheviks’ “history”—in other words the Mensheviks have come
out on top in that field. It is obvious that he will now refuse
to publish my
book.[3] Bear in mind that I am not now
chasing after royalties, i.e., I am prepared to make
concessions (any you like) and agree to the postponement of
payment until the book shows a profit—in short there will
be no risk for the publisher. As regards the censor, I will also
agree to all concessions because in general everything in
the book is undoubtedly legal, with the possible exception
of some expressions that may be
unsuitable.[2]


I shall await an answer.


Our people all kiss Mother and you. So do I.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

November 8, 1908 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received postcards from you and Mother with
the new address. Did you get my letter addressed to
Presnya, 44,4? I am afraid to send a big manuscript to your
private address or any other except that of some publisher.
If you can find me such an address, I will send the
manuscript immediately. In the meantime I shall await an answer
to this letter. Incidentally, if the censor turns out to be
very strict the word “popovshchina” can everywhere be
changed to “fideism” with a footnote to explain it (Fideism
is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or
which generally attaches significance to
faith).[1] This is
for emergencies—it is to explain the nature of the
concessions I am making.


All the best, many kisses for Mother.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
In the first edition of Lenin’s Materialism and Empirio-criticism.
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy the word “fideism”
was used instead of popovshchina, a derogatory Russian term
for “clericalism”, although “popovshchina” remained unchanged
in a number of places. Lenin also suggested changing the word
to “Shamanism”; his sister Anna, in a letter dated January 27,
1909, replied by saying, “’Shamanism’ has come too late. Anyway,
is it any better?” The explanatory note was given in the Preface
to the first and subsequent editions (see Collected Works, Vol.
14, p. 19).

November 17, 1908 
 

Mother dearest,

Manyasha has left today for Lausanne to consult Dr.
Mermod, a distinguished specialist on ear troubles. He made
the appointment in writing—you have to wait your turn
to see famous people here. The general opinion, however,
is that he is a competent doctor. Four years ago I had a
minor operation in his clinic and it was done
magnificently. So I hope he will be able to help Manya, because
her ear is troubling her quite a lot and prevents her from
working. She has taken a room on the same staircase as
ours but a floor higher; a stove has been put in the room
and it is warm there. She has dinner and supper with us.
Her only trouble has been with her Latin. It seems that
Latin is obligatory and the only date for an examination
was November 19. This left her only ten days. I did try to
persuade her to risk it, covering all the grammar in a
“forced march”, especially as she knows French very well.
She proved unable to work intensively, however, on account
of her ear; the time was so short that she stood a poor
chance anyway. And so she dropped the Latin. She consoles
herself with the idea that we shall probably all be going
to Paris and she, of course, with us. In Paris, Latin is not
obligatory. As regards this move of ours—it is almost fully
decided, but I do not expect we shall be able to make a move
in less than a month from now. There will be more than
enough bother with the moving, of course. We hope that
a big city will put some life into us all; we are tired of

    

staying in this provincial backwater. It is true, of course,
that Paris is more expensive. But the climate is no worse
than that of Geneva. Here the climate is rather damp and
the mists are unpleasant. We are going to find out what to
do with the bicycles. It is a pity to leave them behind; they
are excellent things for holidays and pleasure trips, but the
duty on them there is, I believe, quite high, although I
hope to be able to manage that, too. Please tell Anyuta
that I have already sent my philosophical manuscript
to the acquaintance who lived in the town where we
met before my departure for Krasnoyarsk in
1900.[5]
I hope that by now he has received it and delivered
it to you. If he has not, you must go and see him
since he does not live far from you. I ask you very
earnestly to drop me a line immediately on receipt of the
manuscript. I have written to two friends in St. Petersburg
asking them to help me arrange
publication.[1]

I asked them
to write to Anyuta, if anything turns up, through our
mutual acquaintance who works at
Znaniye.[2]

I hope for 
 very little from Znaniye itself; the “boss”
there,[3]

who
gave Anyuta a half promise, is an old fox and will probably
go back on it after sniffing at the atmosphere on Capri, where
Gorky lives. We shall have to look elsewhere. I have already
written that I am prepared to make every
concession.[4]


I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

November 26, 1908 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I had just sent off a “distress” letter to you, when yours
of November 9 arrived to tell me you had received the
work intact. I agree that I have been rather nervous both
about sending it off and while I have been waiting. I am
simply scared to death of losing a huge piece of work that
took many months and the delay really does put my nerves
on edge. You did very well to ask for an answer by telegraph.
If it is refused—it must be published immediately through
Bonch. It seems you will not be able to get another
publisher. Bonch publishes on credit, through someone else,
somehow, and it is not very likely that I shall receive
anything, but, anyway, publish it he
will.[2] I have already
written to two colleagues in St. Petersburg and will write
again. Of course, if anything turns up for you, hand it over,
and, in general, take charge of it yourself, although by all
accounts there is very little chance.

If there is no publisher, send it direct to Bonch
immediately; the only thing is he must not give it to anybody to
read and must look after it very carefully! Write to him
about it.

I am sending two corrections, or rather one correction
and one addition. On page 60 (at the end of the
“Introduction”), following the words “Valentinov confuses them”
(lines 9-10), cross out everything as far as “we” (the last
line but one) and substitute this:

“Valentinov confuses them, and while doing so very

    

amusingly tries to console us: ’We would not consider the
“kinship” of Mach to ... a philosophical
crime’”[1]

(etc., p. 61).

Please put that into the text.

The addition I am sending on a separate sheet which
can easily be pasted in. This is a footnote to the last word of
Section 5 (Chapter
Five).[3] I have no copy of this chapter
at home and so I cannot tell you the last word, but it doesn’t
matter.

All the best,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

P.S. I am sending your letter to Manyasha in Paris. We
have not yet had a letter from her from Paris.

P.S. Please repeat your address; Manyasha took it with
her and I am writing from memory.

 
Notes
 

[1]
This is how the lower half of p. 60 should read.—Lenin
 



[2]
It was difficult for V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich to publish the book
at the publishing firm Zhizn i Znaniye (Life and Knowledge) he
organised in 1907 because that firm had not had time to
consolidate its position.





[3]
The manuscript of this “separate sheet” has been lost. The footnote
concerned Erich Becher’s Philosophische Voraussetzungen der
exakten Naturwissenschaften. Lpz., 1907, which, as Lenin said
in the note, he read only after he had finished writing the book
(see Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 290).

December 10, 1908 
 

Mother dearest,

Today we have at last settled up for the flat. Some of our
things we are sending immediately by slow train. We are
leaving on Saturday or on Monday at the latest. An
apartment has been found for us—Avenue d’Orléans, 69 or 67,
I will give you the exact address when I write
from
Paris.[3] You will now have to write to us through Manyasha.
The apartment that has been taken is on the ground floor,
three rooms, one for Manyasha.

I have just received a letter from Anyuta and have sent
her a telegram: acceptez immédiatement seconde
condition.[1]

I am very glad that you have managed things without Znaniye
and I think you must hurry up and sign a contract on the
second condition. The important thing now is not to lose
time, to make sure that we have a publisher bound by a
formal contract and then speed up publication. If it is
possible the contract should contain a point on immediate
publication. (If you can, haggle for a larger number of free
copies for the author, but do not make an issue of it.) By
the way—I advise Anya when she signs the contract to be
careful, and not to give her own name if she can avoid it,
so as not to be responsible under the press laws (and not
go to prison in the event of trouble; she should get advice
on this from people who know about such things). Can a
contract not be drawn up in my name, so as to leave Anyuta
out of it altogether, i.e., not even mention
her?[4]
 

I have sent you two letters to the wrong address. They
have probably not been delivered to you since you do not
say a word about them. Perhaps it would be advisable
to apply to the post office, attach the envelope from
this letter to your application and point out that the
writing is the same, that the letters are from the same city and
addressed to M. A. Ulyanova or A. I. Yelizarova, and that the
only mistake is in the name of the street. I wrote
Khamovniki, Sokolnichy Street instead of Obolensky Street. Have
you received those letters? If you have not, I will repeat
the addition I sent in one of
them.[2]


I am sending a few more minor changes to Chapter Five.
Please send me the proofs as they come off the press (all
to be addressed to Mlle M. Oulianoff, Boulevard St.-Marcel
27, Paris), so that I can take a look at them. If the worst
comes to the worst I would, entre nous, agree to the first
condition, but the second is so advantageous and the
opportunity of publishing it immediately, and in Moscow
at that, is so attractive that we must seize that opportunity
with both hands. As far as the author’s name is concerned,
I do not insist—I don’t care what name it is, let the
publisher choose one himself.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best
regards to Anyuta. So do we all.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 

[1]
Accept the second condition immediately (Fr.).—Ed.

[2]
See Letter No. 173 and Note No. 263.—Ed.
 



[3]
Lenin and his family had moved from Geneva to Paris because
the newspaper Proletary was published there.





[4]
Lenin’s book was accepted by the private firm of L. Krumbügel
(Zveno Publishers). The contract was drawn up in the name of
Lenin’s sister, Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova, and signed by her.


The contract was for 3,000 copies at 100 rubles per printer’s
signature, each signature being 40,000 letters, and 50 copies for the
author (see her letter to the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya
No. 2-3 for 1930).

Paris, December 19, 1908

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received your letter redirected from Geneva
and a postcard through Manyasha. And so everything is
signed and sealed. Excellent. I wrote to you about
corrections in the letter that was lost. I shall repeat them.I agree
to toning it down in respect of Bazarov and Bogdanov;
in respect of Yushkevich and Valentinov, it should not
be toned down. With regard to “fideism”, etc., I agree only
if forced to, i.e., if the publisher’s demands are in the form
of an ultimatum. As far as the proofs are concerned, it is
not my plan to have them read here and keep people
waiting for them to come from here. That is hardly possible.
All I ask is that you send me immediately impressions made
from the galleys (i.e., the first uncorrected proofs in
addition to the printed signatures as they come off the press)
so that I can, if really necessary, send a telegram or inform
them of misprints, etc. Cauwelaert’s name really should
be spelt with an “o” in Russian, although he is probably
a Fleming and the devil alone knows how the Flemings
pronounce it, “co” or “cau”.

From Geneva I sent you a letter to the right address
containing corrections and additions. Did you get it?

We are now moving from the hotel to our new apartment
—Mr. VI. Oulianoff, 24. Rue Beaunier,
24.[1]

Paris (XIV-me).
We have found a very nice apartment, very elegant and

    

expensive: 840 francs+tax (about 60 francs)
and+concierge (also about the same per annum). For Moscow it would
be cheap (4 rooms+kitchen+storerooms, water and gas),
but here it is considered expensive. However, it will be
roomy and, we hope, good. Yesterday we bought furniture
for Manyasha; ours is being sent from Geneva. The
apartment is almost on the outskirts of Paris, in the south, near
Montsouris Park. It is as quiet as a provincial town. It is
very far from here to the centre but soon there will be a
métro—an underground electric railway—a couple of steps
from here; there are also other means of communication.
So far we are satisfied with Paris.

All best wishes. Regards from all. Kiss Mother for me.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Leave Purishkevich as it
is.[2]

I agree to tone down other
abuse, the same applies to vulgar expressions. “Mentally
projected God” will have to be changed to “mentally
projected for himself—well, to use a mild
expression—religious conceptions” or something of the
sort.[3]

Rue Beaunier, 24,
Paris (XIV-me)

December 24, 1908 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received your letter about the proofs and hasten
to scribble a few words, though I believe my last letter
cleared up all misunderstandings. I never assumed and
still do not assume that proofs would be sent here to be
corrected—i.e., with your having to wait for the corrected
proofs to be returned from here. I ask you to send me the
proofs just in case, i.e., either so that I can point out the
misprints and arrange for the most important corrections,
or so that I can stop the printing by telegraph in an
emergency, etc., or, lastly, so that I can have at least one printed
copy by me in case of certain highly improbable
happenings.

That is why I ask you to get two copies of the first(or
of the second, or, better still, of the first and the second)
proofs printed; one copy you will read while the other comes
straight to me without anybody holding it up for anything.
I think such a thing is quite possible for the publisher;
I shall not cause the slightest delay unless it is absolutely
necessary. If pulling off two copies involves any expense
(which is hardly likely and there is no need for us to raise
the question), I will bear it myself.

If you send the first proofs regularly, the delay will never
amount to a week because in any case it takes several
days to correct it completely and to print what has

    

been read (correction of the first proof; correction of the
second proof; imposition; printing). The publisher is
exaggerating when he talks about a week’s delay.

By the way—I will give you a telegraphic form to be
used in case of need right away. I shall write “arrêtez 12
or 65, etc.”, arrêtez meaning “delay the printing”, or “wait
for author’s corrections”, and the two figures meaning, the
first figure the chapter, and the second the section (12=
Chapter One, Section 2; 65=Chapter Six, Section 5, etc.).
I repeat that I shall do this only in extreme cases.

Instead of printing the chapter headings in heavy type
it is better, if possible, to set them in small type or in
italics. This, however, is not important.

Has one of my letters with addenda and minor changes
gone astray? I see from your letter you received corrections
and
addenda[1]

regarding E. Becher, but before this there
was another letter containing corrections.

I am very, very glad that the matter is moving fast.
That is the main thing.

All the best. Kiss Mother.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

We all send regards. We have begun to settle down in
Paris.

February 6, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday I sent you a letter in which I said I had
completely given up all hope of seeing the proofs and this
morning the first of them arrived! I am sending you a list of
misprints (in general there are not many) in case you need
it; it would be interesting to know whether it will reach
you quickly and be in time. I would rather not send the
proofs themselves.

KonjieKnHH instead of KOJiJieKijHio (page 15, line 8 from
the bottom of the manuscript; page 5, line 1 from the top
of the galley).

IlpeflnonojKeHHeM instead of npeAnoJiojKeHHH (page 22, lines
3-4 from the bottom of the manuscript; page 7, lines 3-4
from the top of the galley).

TejiecHHe instead of ie Jiecmje (page 28, lines 6-7 from
the top of the manuscript; page 9, line 3 from the top of the
galley).

OMOIJHH instead of 9jiion,HH (page 36, lines 3-4 from the
bottom of the manuscript; page 10, line 2 from the bottom
of the
galley).[1]

That is all.

All the best, kiss Mother.

Yours,

V. U.

Regards from all. Manyasha and I are just leaving
for the theatre to see a Russian play. They are doing
Andreyev’s Days of Our Life.

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday we sent you a telegram and got a reply
today.[2]
Manyasha has been and still is eager to leave at once, but
I think she now agrees to wait for a letter. How is Mother
now? I read Mitya’s letter and I ask him to write to us
 regularly now; as a doctor he is better able to see, especially
after consultations with specialists, what course the disease
is taking and I ask him especially to inform us more often,
even if only in a brief letter. Please farm out the proofs—
it is absolutely heartless to plant them on you at such a
time. You have the manuscript, so hire some student, etc.,
(or through the
“writer”[1]

,

etc.) as the last proof-reader,
give him my address and don’t waste your attention on
the correcting of proofs. You have enough to worry about
without that.... Give Mother many, many kisses. Everyone
sends very best regards.

Mark does not want to go until his time is up; he says
times are such that he will not be allowed in the capital
in any case.

All the best,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

Dear Anyuta,

I am sending the corrections to the proofs I received
today. I have received: (a) page proofs for pages 97–112; ((})
galley proofs 81–97 (pp. 302–364 of the manuscript), not
made up.

But between the first and the second there is something
missing; the made-up pages end at page 274 of the
manuscript (there are also pp. 274a, 274e) and the galleys begin
at page 302. This means that about 27 pages of the
manuscript have been left out! Does this not mean that a whole
signature is missing? Could it have fallen out of the parcel?
Or perhaps they forgot to send it or give it to you from the
printer’s? Please send me the proofs of the missing pages
(pp. 274–302 of the MS) and, under all circumstances, take
steps to ensure that they are not left out when the book
is made up and printed. The missing part is most important
for me and for my book.

Here is a description of the omission that is more accurate,
according to the manuscript. The last words of the last
made-up page, number 112, are “These active forces must”. In
the manuscript this will be page 274, or 274a or 274b. The gap
comes after these words. The missing part is from page
274a to page 302, to the words “Let us continue the
quotation from Bazarov” inclusive, that is, to the third line
from the top inclusive. That is the exact size of the
gap.[3]

There is one other mistake, or rather not a mistake but
something in the galleys that may lead to a mistake when
they are made up into pages; seventeen lines from the bottom

    

of galley No. 88, beginning from “rejieii” (page 14
of the 4th German edition), etc. (page 338 of the
manuscript) must be transferred to the foot of galley No. 89.

In other words the words. “Religious experience” (line
18 from the bottom of galley No. 88, line 6 from the top of
page 334 of the manuscript) are followed by “reneM” (p. 14,
etc.), i.e., page 338, line 7 from the top. This must be watched
carefully to make sure that there is no mistake when
the pages are made up.




Please give the last proofs (and your correspondence
with me) to someone who knows languages and pay him. Let
Mitya take one hundred rubles, go to the “writer” and
hire[1]

either the writer himself, or somebody he recommends for
the work, to read the final proofs and get in touch with
me. This must be done because you now have no time for
proofs, of course, and will only worry yourself to death.
Will you please do as I ask immediately.




Yesterday I wrote to you and Manyasha did, too. Give
Mother many kisses. “Un peu mieux” is very
indefinite....[4]
Write.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

P.S. Please send me the part that already has been printed
immediately; I will make a list of the misprints. This is very
important because we shall be able to correct some things
even after the book has been
printed.[2]

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday I received your letter with a postscript from
dear Mother. Manyasha and all of us were awfully glad.
Manyasha was more lively today and went out walking with
Mark—today is mardi
gras, [2] and the French are on the
rampage. Give Mother many kisses from me and from all of
us—we all fervently hope that she will now get better
without any setbacks.




Today I received the proofs of signatures 8 and 9 (pp.
113–144) already made up into pages and was very pleased
to see that there are no gaps and no mixed galleys (which
I wrote about last time before I had seen the proofs of the
made-up pages; by the way, you send the packages without
any string, and single pages and even whole signatures
may easily fall out).

The proofs of these two signatures are, on the whole,
quite good, and that gives me great pleasure. I still cannot
risk withdrawing my request to give the proofs to a
professional proof-reader (about which I wrote in the last letter),
because I am afraid you will find it difficult to devote time
to such boring work during Mother’s illness and to
concentrate your attention on it.




I am sending the corrections to the page proofs of
signatures 8 and 9 (pp. 113–144). When they begin to print the
signatures, please send them to me from the first, so that

    

I can draw up a list of misprints that must be pointed out,
even if only on a sheet pasted separately into the book.


All the best, and kiss Mother once more.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov[1]

cost of the state. An order of the Governor of Yeniseisk dated
April 10 appointed the village of Tesinskoye in Minusinsk District
as the  place of exile of Starkov and Krzhizhanovsky; they left
for Minusinsk with Lenin at their own expense on board the

Dear Anyuta,

Your letter and Mitya’s have reached me here—many
thanks for them. I wrote to you from Paris that the last
proofs were excellent. If Mother is better and you are not
too tired I shall not, of course, insist that you pass on the
proofs to someone else. But are you not too worn out? I
was glad to learn from Mitya’s letter that Mother is better!
At last—she must have had a rough time. Please send
proofs as before, not only the page proofs, but the galley
proofs as well (it does not matter if I correct them an
extra time; the fewer mistakes the better). Please send the
printed signatures at once to Paris, too.

I am taking a holiday in Nice. The place is wonderful—
sunny, warm, dry and a southern sea. I am returning to
Paris in a few days.

I embrace Mother fondly and send best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

March 9, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I arrived in Paris yesterday evening (after a splendid
holiday in Nice) and read your letter of the 16th.

I am sending corrections to signatures 10 and 11 of the
made-up pages. Only two are of importance. The title of
Bogdanov’s book is Empiric-monism and not
Empirio-criticism. This misprint mustbe given special prominence in
the list of errata if it is too late to correct
it[1]

(I do not
know whether you received my postcard from Nice—I sent
two from there—in which I mentioned this misprint). The
other is on page 170, line 9 from the top—in the quotation
from Plekhanov the word “amy” is unnecessary.

As regards giving the proofs to someone else—you are
right, of course, to take all the necessary steps, because
it would have been extremely difficult to combine such
painstaking and tedious work with the job of nursing Mother.
I can only express my amazement that the last proofs could
be exemplary under such working conditions.

It is most important to me to get the book out as quickly
as possible. There has been a very great delay. It will be
unfortunate if it does not come out by March 15 (O.S.)!
As far as breach of contract is concerned, I don’t know
whether you can make a claim. I doubt it. And is it worth
while spoiling relations with the publisher irrevocably?
It is not.
 

Is the absence of proofs in recent days due partially to
your having stopped sending them on account of my trip?
I hope that, and not a delay in setting and printing, is the
reason. Please send everything now.

I see from Mitya’s letter that Mother’s health is
improving. At last! Many kisses for Mother and very best
regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Please do not tone down the places against
Bogdanov and against Lunacharsky’s popovshchina. We have
completely broken off relations with them. There is no reason
for toning them down, it is not worth the trouble.

P.S. Give the “writer” a thousand thanks for consenting
to help. It seems, after all, he is a real Marxist and not a
“Marxist for an hour” like some others. Immediately
present him with a copy of my book in my
name.[2]

March 12, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received the clean proofs of signatures 1-9 and
13—“clean” because they are on good paper and have
apparently already been printed, although they have a stamp
at the top of each signature (put on by the printer) saying
“proof”, which I do not understand.

Whatever the case may be, whether they are proofs or
whether they are copies of signatures already printed, I
must say that the jumbled paragraphs have been completely
corrected and that, in general, these clean proofs are
thoroughly satisfactory. I am now thinking of one thing and
one thing only and I beg you—speed up the issue of the
book. Things have now been properly organised, the proofs
are excellent, but hurry, hurry, at all costs, for there has
already been a devilishly long, an impossible delay. If,
therefore, there is anything whatsoever hindering you, you
must immediately hire an assistant proof-reader (if you
have not yet done so).

I am sending a list of misprints that have not been
corrected but which were pointed out in my previous
corrections; this list is only for signatures 6-9 and for signature
13 (I will send the list relating to the first five signatures
tomorrow or the day after because I have given the proofs
to someone and must ask for them back).

These misprints absolutely must be shown in a list of
errata at the end or the beginning of the book because there
are some that distort the meaning. On the whole there are

    

so few misprints that under no circumstances must the book
be delayed on account of them.

I have not seen signatures 10, 11 and 12 (pp. 145–192)
made up into, pages; for this reason I shall send the list
of misprints for those signatures separately. I am heading
them exactly—list of misprints for such-and-such made-up
printer’s signatures. The book must be published without
waiting for my last list of misprints but with this present
list printed under the heading of errata.

[[BOX:


The most important—p. 126, line 16 from the top

]]


All the best; kiss Mother for me.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Please do not tone down anything in the places
against Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and Co. They must not be
toned down. You have deleted the passage about Chernov
being a “more honest” opponent than they, which is a great
pity. The shade of meaning you have given it is not the
one I want. There is now no overall consistency in my
accusations. The crux of the issue is that our Machists are
dishonest, mean-spirited, cowardly enemies of Marxism
in
philosophy.[1]
[2]


 
Notes
 

[1]
There follows, in the original, a list of the misprints.—Ed.
 



[2]
Since the manuscript has been lost it is impossible to indicate
exactly which place in the book this refers to. Apparently it refers
to Section 1 of Chapter Two, “The ’Thing-in-Itself’ or V. Chernov
Refutes Frederick Engels”; here Lenin speaks of the writings of
Bogdanov,  Valentinov,  Bazarov,   Chernov  and  other  Machists
against the basic materialist tenet, recognising the objective
existence, independent of man’s consciousness, of matter—the
“thing-in-itself” (see Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 98).

As you probably know from the newspapers there is a
post office strike going on
here.[3] Complete irregularity. I
am not getting the proofs (I have received nothing since
the page proofs of signature 13).

In any case I am sending this by registered post and
ask you to send a registered reply too.

(1) I am sending a list of misprints in signatures 1–5.

(2) I am sending a correction to p. 630 of the
MS.[1]


(3) Please include this in the errata; footnote at the
beginning of Section 6 of Chapter Three (i.e., the section on
freedom and necessity)—instead of “not only a smile” read
“not a smile, but disgust”.

This is an essential correction and if it is not made my
idea will be distorted; I do not see anything funny in
flirting with religion, but I see a lot that is disgusting.

I have already written about not, under any
circumstances, toning down the passages against Bogdanov and
Lunacharsky in the second half of the book and hope you have
received the letters. Especially—do not throw out
“Purishkevich” and the others in the section on the criticism of
Kantianism!
 

I have received a postcard from Mark. How is Mother’s
convalescence progressing? Give her many kisses for me.
We are all well and send regards.

Yours,

V. U.

March 22, 1909—today there is news of the end of the
post office strike. Nevertheless I am sending this by
registered post and ask you to answer also by registered
post—just in
case![2]

Dear Anyuta,

I have just received your registered letter of March 7.
Many thanks!

We were very glad to get the news that dear Mother
is better and has begun to get up. I send her all my
love.

How is Mark? Is there any news from him?

The strike here has finally come to an end. At last! An
excellent proletarian affair was seriously interfering with
our literary affairs....

I still have not received your proofs and the made-up
pages. I have seen the clean proofs of signatures 1-9
(pp. 1-144) and signature 13 (pp. 193–208) only. I have
not seen any proofs after Section 6 of Chapter Three (the
beginning).

The postman, to be sure, gives us hope—the sacs de
Russie that were not opened during the strike will be opened
and delivered today or tomorrow. I am afraid to hope!

Nevertheless I am very, very glad that there is progress,
that signatures 19 and 20 have now been made up and the
end must be near. It has been a great strain on my nerves
waiting for this long drawn-out book.




I am sending an addendum. Do not hold up the book
for it. But if there is time, let them print it in different
type (in smaller type, for instance) at the very end of the

    

book. I regard it as extremely important to counterpose
Chernyshevsky to the
Machists.[1]


I agree, of course, to 50 copies being placed at your
disposal.

Best regards,


Yours,


V. Ul.

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received the page proofs of signatures 15–18
and am sending you a list of misprints that must be given
on a separate sheet at the end or at the beginning of the
book.

I have received only signatures 1-9 and 13 of the “clean”
proofs, i.e., probably those that have been printed (although
they bear what seems to be a strange stamp, “Proof”).
Please send me the remainder of the “clean” proofs, i.e.,
those already printed.

Write and tell me when you expect the book to be out.
Many kisses for Mother.

Yours,

V. U.[1]

April 5, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday I received the made-up pages of signatures
14–20 (pp. 209–320) which I already have (the only page
proofs I have not now received is signature 10, i.e., pp. 177-
192) and today I got galleys 226–234 (pp. 784–809 of the
MS).

I am sending the misprints in signature 14 (pp. 209–224)
—the misprints in the other signatures have already been
sent—and corrections to the galleys. Actually there is one
important correction here; in galley 234 (end of the first
paragraph in Section 7 “on a Russian ’idealist physicist”’)
—page 809 of the manuscript—the words “materialist and
thinker, Professor V. I. Vernadsky” have been set. This
completely distorts the meaning. It should read “natural
scientist and thinker”,
etc.[4]

If it is too late to correct it, there absolutely must be a
notice of this misprint on a separate sheet since it distorts
the meaning.

In answer to your question “where to put pages 802a
and 802b and where are they? They are not in the
manuscript”—those pages were sent separately (from Geneva)
and they must be placed as a footnote to the word “object”
on line 7 in the paragraph (in Section 6) that begins with
the words “Rey became muddled because” (this is galley
232 and page 802 of the
manuscript).[1]

 

In any case (i.e., in case these specially sent
addenda[2]

did not reach you) I am sending them again. You must
not, of course, delay the book on account of them. It seems
that the book is “delaying itself” sickeningly at the
publisher’s ... ad infinitum. Obviously it will not come out
before Easter!...

Very best regards. I send Mother kisses and hope you
will both soon be in the Crimea.

Yours,

V. U.[3]


 
Notes
 

[1]
The footnote was included (Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 297).

[2]
I have a copy of that addendum (footnote to p. 802) written
on a single page with another addendum (end of Section 7, p. 812 of
the MS). They have probably both been lost and I am repeating them
both. The printing of the book must not be delayed for either of them.—Lenin

[3]
There follows, in the original, a list of the misprints.—Ed.
 



[4]
This misprint was not given in the list of errata nor was it
corrected in the text of the first edition of Materialism and
Empiriocriticism. It was first corrected in the Third Edition (Russian)
of, the Collected Works (see Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 300).

April 6, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday I sent you a letter containing the misprints
in signature 14 and two addenda. I hope you have received
them.

This morning I received clean proofs of signatures 10, 11
and 12 and the page proofs of signature 21.

I am sending the misprints that must be printed in the
book in a special list of errata.

It is a great pity that I have to send the misprints in small
doses (see P.S.); I am afraid that some of the separate pages
containing lists of misprints may get lost. Perhaps you
will paste them together as you receive them and give
them to the printer all at once?

As far as money is concerned—please send it on to me
all at once (I am now in need of money); it is best done
through the bank, specifically, through the Crédit
Lyonnais. To prevent the people here from charging too much
for the exchange it is best to buy francs in Moscow and send
the exact sum to the Crédit Lyonnais in Paris, Agence Z,
Avenue d’Orléans, 19, addressed to Mr. W. Oulianoff,
current account No. 6420.

This is the most convenient way. It is no use trusting
to a messenger; by the method I have described you have
only to keep the receipt, there is no need to send any
cheques.
 

I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that Mother will
soon manage to get out of Moscow. Mother absolutely must
rest and take a holiday in the Crimea. Many, many kisses
for her, regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. I have now sent lists of misprints for all the 21
signatures—1-18 signatures of the clean proofs and 19–21 of
the page proofs. Please check up whether you have all these
lists of misprints and let us know. I will repeat them if
any have been
lost.[1]

April 8, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

Today I received the page proofs of signature 22 (pp. 337-
352). There are very few misprints in it. I am sending a
list of
them.[1]


In connection with the publication of the book I have
two important requests to make of you.

(1) The experience of the previous month shows that
the publisher and printer are capable of delaying the
remaining four of five signatures for a long, long time, but
it is hellishly important to me for the book to appear sooner.
I have not only literary but also serious political
commitments that are linked up with the publication of the
book.[4]
I therefore beg you to engage an assistant for yourself (or
for the “writer”, if you hand it over to him) to pay special
visits to the printers and keep urging them along. It is not
difficult, of course, to find a student for about fifteen rubles
a week—there will be crowds of candidates for such a post.
Offer him a
bonus[2]

of some twenty rubles if the book
comes out by
April 10.[3]

He will visit the printer, take the

    

proofs from there, bring them back corrected without delay,
will follow up the work day by day, etc. I do not grudge
100 rubles for this. You must do this or tell the “writer”
to do it, for it will be the end of me if the book is delayed
until the second half of April.

(2) I have now sent you the misprints in all the 22
signatures. Let them set a list of those misprints immediately
and send me a proof; there will be time enough and it is
very important to me because the book must be well
produced.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

Many kisses for Mother!

 
Notes
 

[1]
The list has been lost.—Ed.

[2]
Obviously you cannot handle the Russian blockhead without
a bribe. Give the make-up man 10 rubles if the book comes out by
April 10—you must bring pressure to bear on the printer in addition
to, the publisher.—Lenin

[3]
Lenin gave this date in the Old Style; the letter itself is
dated in the New Style.—Ed.
 



[4]
Lenin hurried the publication of Materialism and
Empirio-criticism because of the enlarged conference of the
Proletary editorial
board (this was actually the Bolshevik centre) at which a decisive
battle against Bogdanov and his followers was to be fought.

May 21, 1909 
 

Mother dearest,

A big merci for your letter of April 25. We were all greatly
pleased to learn that you are staying in the Crimea and
at last having a fairly decent holiday. This is how matters
stand with Manyasha. She has put her name down for
the
examinations[1] and is now zealously swotting. We have
to wait for the results—in a few weeks it will be known
whether she will finish her examinations successfully. I
have no doubt that she will, for she works very
conscientiously. She is now quite well. Now and again we drag her
out for walks—not long ago we took her to the forest at
Clamart, a few versts from Paris, where the air is
wonderful.

The best thing, of course, would be for her to stay here
for another winter and for all of us to live together. We shall
have to try to arrange that as soon as the examinations
are over. We are going for a holiday in the summer
(somewhere near the end of June or the beginning of July, I think)
—we shall take her along with us—and then in the autumn
she will wait for you here and in Paris we shall all be
beautifully provided for.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you have a
good holiday. We here are all well and send regards.

Yours,

V. U.
 

P.S. Best regards to Anyuta. I have received the
book.[2]
It has been beautifully published—but everyone
grumbles at the price (2 rubles 60 kopeks), but that, apparently,
is the publisher’s fault.

May 26, 1909 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I received your letter a few days after I had sent a letter
to Mother in Alupka.

I have received the book and find that it has been nicely
published. There were no fewer misprints at the end than
at the beginning and the proof-reader’s ignorance of foreign
languages is obvious (the English “A New Name for Old
Ways of
Thinking”[1]

has been so distorted that it is
ridiculous),[3] but that is an inevitable and insignificant
shortcoming. On the whole I am satisfied with it. Everyone
complains of the price—and rightly so. In future we shall
have a point in the contract about the price as well as the
number of copies. I was hard pressed by the publisher and
would, in any case, have agreed to any terms, as long as
the book was published.

The publisher has not yet sent any money and I am
beginning to be afraid that he will swindle
us.[4] I have
written to Peres. Will you also please write to the
publisher—three or four weeks have passed and he promised
to pay in a week. (You absolutely must get a promissory
note for the remaining sum.) Please send me the five
hundred rubles that are in the bank (Crédit Lyonnais, Agence Z,
Avenue d’Orléans, 19. Mr. Oulianoff. Current account No.
6420) since I cannot rely on the publisher.
 

Things are bad
here—Spaltung,[2]

or rather, there will
be one; I hope that in a month or six weeks I shall be able
to give you exact information. So far I can do no more than
guess.[5]

Manyasha is swotting hard. She is quite well and will
probably pass her examinations. What will happen then, I
do not know. I think she wants to go home.

We have not yet decided when we shall go to the seaside
or where we shall
go.[6] But this summer we shall go for
certain.

Many kisses for Mother and all the best to you.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Dear Anya,

You asked in your last letter why I do not write. All this
winter I have been in a state of utter melancholy, the time
has been frittered away, I could not work properly and so I
was in no fit state to write. If Manyasha had not written
about Volodya and Volodya about her I should have given
you all the details about them both as I did before, but
apart from that there is nothing to write, we are just jogging
along. Every time they wrote I told them to give you my
regards but I don’t suppose they did. I shall try and write
soon, but in the meantime I send many kisses to you and to
dear Maria Alexandrovna from myself and from Mother.

Yours,

Nadya

 
Notes
 

[1]
Stepanov apparently did not look at it at all....—Lenin

[2]
Split (Ger.).—Ed.
 



[3]
Lenin was referring to the inaccurate translation of the title of
William James’s Pragmatism. A New Name for Some Old Ways
of Thinking that he mentions in Materialism and
Empirio-criticism (see Collected Works, Vol. 14, p. 342).





[4]
Lenin received royalties for his Materialism and Empiric-criticism
from Krumbügel in full (see his sister Anna’s letter to the editor
of Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya published in No. 2-3 of that journal
for 1930).





[5]
Lenin refers here to the coming conference of the extended
Proletary editorial board; it was called on Lenin’s initiative and took
place in Paris from the 21st to the 30th of June (N.S.), 1909. The
conference was attended by nine members of the Bolshevik
centre—the highest body of the Bolshevik group, elected by the
Bolshevik delegates to the 5th (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
and also representatives of the St. Petersburg, Moscow Regional
and Urals organisations. The conference proceeded under Lenin’s
guidance and his speeches on all the main points on the agenda
shaped the character of the conference. The theses put forward
by Lenin formed the basis of the decisions adopted by the
conference.

The conference roundly condemned otzovism and ultimatumism
as harmful and dangerous trends in the working-class movement.
A. Bogdanov, leader and inspirer of the otzovists, ultimatumists
and God-builders, was expelled from the Bolshevik group.





[6]
Lenin spent late July and August on holiday with his family—-
his wife (N. K. Krupskaya), her mother (Y. V. Krupskaya) and
his sister (M. I. Ulyanova)—in the village of Bombon (Department
de Seine-et-Marne) near Paris.

Dear Mitya,

Manyasha has already written to you about her illness.
I also want your advice. The doctor has diagnosed that she
has inflammation of the gut projecting from the caecum (that’s
appendicitis, isn’t it?). I asked a very good local surgeon
and he confirmed it. He advises an operation. Everyone
says it is not dangerous and effects a radical cure.

The surgeon (Dr. Dubouchez) is praised by everybody.
He recently performed an operation (the same one) on the
wife of a friend—it was excellent, a teaspoonful of blood,
in eight days she began to get about. The hospital is a good
one.

The attacks are not very bad now. There is no high
temperature. The pains are not great. Please answer me
immediately—I am in favour of an operation but am afraid to
take the risk without your advice. Answer immediately.

There is no doubt that they perform good operations
here. The doctor does not advise her to travel before the
operation.

I shall not write to Mother because I am afraid of
frightening her for no good reason. There is no danger, Manyasha
does not even stay in bed all the time. Nor shall I write
to Anyuta because Mother may read it.

Please write to Mark and through him to Anyuta (if you
can do it without scaring Mother). It will probably be
better not to write to the Crimea at all because they will
get frightened.
 

And so I await an answer; here they advise us to get
the operation done quickly. Do you also?

All the best,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

July 19, 1909 
 

Dear Mother,

Today I received your picture postcard of the Crimea
(the postcard was enclosed in an envelope with a corner
cut off; this greatly surprised us—did you do it or the local
post office?).

You ask about money for Manyasha. I answered your
last letter, but not immediately (we were moving to a new
apartment at the time), so that your postcard and my letter
crossed in the post.

I offered Manyasha some money since I have some. She
refused absolutely to take it; she said she did not need it
and showed me the 70 francs she had.

We are going to Brittany for our holiday, probably next
Saturday. Y.V. has already gone there. Manyasha is
recovering rapidly; now I can tell you everything that happened
—she had appendicitis, that is, inflammation of the gut
projecting from the caecum. If the disease is caught in time
it is not at all dangerous and can be completely cured
by an operation. After consulting Mitya and the best
doctors here, we decided on an immediate operation. We
put Manyasha into a surgical hospital for a week (it was
a very good hospital). The operation was very successful;
Manyasha came out of hospital in a week and has been
at home for three days. She now walks and eats everything.
She is convalescing rapidly. She felt better as soon as the
appendix was removed. She will be able to travel by rail at
the end of the week and we are thinking of leaving for
Brittany together.
 

And there is nothing to worry about. It is a good thing
that Manyasha had her operation here because the surgeons
here are excellent. Chronic appendicitis would still be
troubling her and would trouble her for a long time if she
had not had the operation. Now she is quite well.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good
health. Do not be angry with me for not having written
about Manyasha immediately.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Regards from all.

My address: Mr. Wl. Oulianoff. 4. Rue Marie Rose. 4
Paris. XIV.

August 24, 1909 
 

Mother dearest,

I received your letter yesterday and am answering by
return of post. There is no need at all for you to worry about
Manyasha. She is convalescing splendidly. She can’t, of
course, walk about much yet; she still has some pain in
her leg (the right one). We asked the doctors in Paris
and here in the country whether that was a bad sign.
They all say “no”. They say she is convalescing well, if
somewhat slowly. They advise Manyasha to wear a bandage
so that the scar is not shaken so much when she walks.
Yesterday she walked five or six versts, slept excellently
afterwards and feels quite well. Generally speaking, she
looks incomparably better, she has a good appetite, sleeps
well and looks perfectly healthy. In short—I am being
quite frank—everything is going well although rather
slowly, probably because of the great fatigue she experienced
in winter. We are having a good holiday here. We have
been here three weeks and expect to be here another two,
or perhaps three. I cannot yet say whether Manyasha will
be able to travel to Russia in a month’s time. She has
recovered very considerably during her three weeks’
holiday. I advise her to drink as much milk as she can and
to eat curds and whey. She prepares the curds and whey
herself, but in my opinion she is not feeding herself up
enough; I am always quarreling with her on those grounds.
 

Our rooms here are good, and the board is good and not
expensive (10 francs a day for the four of us). Nadya and
I often go cycling.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good health.

Yours,

V. U.

We all send our regards.

P.S. What news is there from Mark? Has he completely
recovered from his operation? Give him regards from all
of us.

October 25, 1909 
 

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received a letter from you and Anyuta
and also the money sent from the publisher. Merci. Today
I got a note from Manyasha, who writes that she wants
to take a cure. I also got the book (Kriticheskoye Obozreniye)
she sent.

Manyasha writes that you are still living in furnished
rooms. That must be extremely inconvenient. It will be a
good thing if you can soon move into the flat you found
with the aid of your acquaintances.

Mitya will probably visit you in Moscow when he hears
of Manyasha’s arrival. I should like him to drop me a line
telling me how he finds Manyasha and which doctor (or
doctors) he wishes to consult about her.




There are no changes here. We are all well and send our
regards. After wonderful weather during the first half of
October, real autumn has begun. I embrace you fondly,
my dear, and send my best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

November 4, 1909

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received Manyasha’s letter with the
new address. How are things in the new apartment? Is it
warm there? Our apartment with central heating has turned
out to be too warm—although it may be because of the warm
weather we are having here. Manyasha did right to go to a
competent doctor—she must now follow his advice exactly.

I have received
Rossiya.[1] Many thanks. I have also
had word from the historian—he must be a very narrow
person. It is a pity that he intends writing nonsense! It
seems as if we shall have to give him up for
lost.[2]

I am leaving for Brussels
tomorrow[3] and shall stay
there a few days. I have written an answer to Anyuta in
Saratov on the assumption that she is already there.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best regards
to Manyasha and Mitya. So does everybody.

Yours,

V. U.

Lenin went to Brussels to attend the Eleventh Session of the
International Socialist Bureau (ISB). On November 7, 1909 he
spoke at a meeting of the session on the split in the
Social-Democratic Workers’ Party of Holland and voted in favour of admitting
to the International the Dutch Marxists (Tribune supporters)
who represented the Left wing of the working-class movement
in Holland. On November 8 Lenin attended a meeting of the
Inter-parliamentary Committee of the ISB after which he returned
to Paris.

Davydov’s House, Apt. 4,

Bozheninsky Street,

Devichye Polye,

Moscow,

Russia

Dear Manyasha,

Today I received an issue of Utro Rossii with the vulgar
nonsense about
Gorky.[1] For some days now a number
of newspapers in Paris (L’&EACUTEclair) and in Berlin
(Berliner
Tageblatt)[2] have been engaged in similar lies. Some days
ago there was a good refutation of this mass of lies in
Vorwärts, where it was very correctly demonstrated and very
wittily explained that this is all one big nonsensical
invention. Some fool heard rumours he did not understand and
got everything wrong—scraps he had picked up about
otzovism, the school, philosophy and so on. Utro Rossii must
be a shady little rag to have cooked up an “interview”
just for the sake of sensation. Today Rech is also engaged
in the fabrication of similar scandal. The Cadets are happy
to have something to lie and talk scandal about.

How are you? How is Mother? I have had no news from
you for quite a while. Write and let me know how you
are getting on, what you are doing, and how Mitya is. There
have been no changes here. Winter is beginning—! go to

    

the library. The apartment is warm. Y.V. is feeling rather
poorly. Nadya is zealously studying French.

All the best, kiss Mother many, many times.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Did you get the reply to the historian? With regard
to my books at
Sablino[3]—if the opportunity occurs, it
would be fine to ask one of our St. Petersburg friends to
send them to me here, if not all of them, then at least what
there is of Marx and Engels and the best of the classics.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
On November 15, 1909, the newspaper Utro Rossii (Morning of
Russia), organ of the Moscow industrialists published by P. P.
Ryabushinsky, printed a libellous story about “M. Gorky’s
Expulsion from the S. D. Party”. The “interview” of which Lenin
writes was published on November 17 under the heading “The
Excommunication of Maxim Gorky”. This libellous account was
taken up by Rech and other bourgeois papers, Russian and foreign.
In reply to the inventions about Gorky’s expulsion that were
being spread by bourgeois newspapers Lenin wrote his article
“The Bourgeois Press Fable About the Expulsion of Gorky” (see
Collected Works, Vol. 16, p. 106).





[2]
L’Eclair (Lightning)–a Paris newspaper published from 1888
to 1939.

Berliner Tageblatt (Berliner Tageblatt und Handelszeitung—
Berlin Daily and Commercial Gazette)—published from 1871 to
1939.





[3]
Lenin’s sister Anna, her husband Mark Yelizarov, and Lenin’s
mother were living at the village of Sablino near a railway station
of the same name, not far from St. Petersburg. Lenin visited
his relatives there in 1905 and 1906. A room was allotted to him
in the cottage and he was able to work and rest there.

Mother dearest,

I have received your letter and Manya’s. A big merci
for them. Today I received a second letter from Manyasha
with the pleasant news that there is no need for me to write
to our acquaintance a second time. I am worried that your
apartment is so cold; what will it he like in winter if the
temperature is only 12° now? You must not catch cold....
Is there nothing you can do? Perhaps you should put in
a small stove. That is often done here (we do not need it
because we have steam heating and it is very warm), and
we did it in Siberia. So far there has been no great cold,
here, at any rate, but the winter is still to come.

I am very, very grateful to Manyasha for the news. If
she should have an opportunity I should very much like
her to obtain for me the new Moscow agricultural statistics
(1907–09) and to find out (even from a shop) how much
Izvestiya zemleustroitelnykh komissii costs; I cannot get this
publication through acquaintances and I need it.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you are keeping
well. Best regards to Manyasha from me and from all of
us here.

Yours,

V. U.

Moscow,

Russia

Dear Manyasha,

I recently learned, quite by accident, that there is to
be a congress of statisticians in Moscow at Christmas—
or rather one of the sections of the congress of doctors and
naturalists will be a congress of
statisticians.[1] I have
already heard the names of a couple of acquaintances who
will be there (one from Moscow, the other from the
provinces), and no doubt there will be more than two
acquaintances there. It is extremely important to take advantage
of this to get me the Zemstvo statistical publications. I
urge you to try to find at least one statistician of your
acquaintance at the congress and give him my address and
my request to send me Zemstvo statistical publications:
(1) on peasant and landowner farms—especially current
statistics and house-to-house censuses; (2) handicraftsmen
and industry; (3) on the law of November 9,
1906[2] and
on the acquisition of commune lands by peasants. I think
you may give my address direct. If they say that they
cannot send them abroad, please give your address and I will
send you the money, so that you can send the statistics
on to me. They are absolutely essential to me. If it will
be of any use I can write a brief appeal to the statisticians
(I am sending one for you to use at your own
discretion),[3]
so that statisticians of your acquaintance can distribute

    

it (or show it) to those from other towns, adding their own
request (or trying to get consent) to send the publications.

Drop me a line if you find someone who can do it. If
you do not, I shall write to you again.

The publication I wrote about last time is not called
Izvestiya zemleustroitelnykh komissii (although I have heard
that such a publication exists too) but Izvestiya Zemskogo
Otdela (Ministry of the Interior). Is there any civil servant
of your acquaintance who can acquire this work?

All the best to you, kiss Mother.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Twelfth Congress of Russian Naturalists and Physicians was
held in Moscow from December 28, 1909 to January 6, 1910; a
sub-section of statisticians took part.





[2]
This refers to Stolypin’s decree of November 9 (22), 1909
“Supplement to Certain Provisions of the Operative Law on Peasant
Landownership  and Land Tenure”, which granted peasants the
right to leave the communes and set up farmsteads. (For further
details of Stolypin’s agrarian policy see Collected Works, Vol. 13,
pp. 217–431.)





[3]
The manuscript of Lenin’s note of request to the statisticians
has been lost. Copies of it were made and distributed among
statisticians; one copy was seized during a search at the house   of
Lenin’s sister Maria in 1909. The text of the copy was preserved
in the records of the Department of Police.

Dear Manyasha,

Today I received Mother’s letter (to Nadya and me)
with your postscript. I am very, very glad that you have
made quite good arrangements and that Mother is pleased
that there is no housekeeping for her to do. Let us hope
that the end of winter will not disappoint us. Up to now
the winter here has been more like spring than winter.
Today, for instance, has been a real spring day, sunny,
dry and warm, and Nadya and I took advantage of it for a
wonderful morning excursion to the Bois de Boulogne. In
general we have made good use of the holidays—we have
been to museums, the theatre and the Musée
Grévin,[2]
which gave us much pleasure. This evening I intend to go
to an estaminet to listen to a “goguette
révolutionnaire”[1]

by “songsters” (an unhappy translation of chansonniers),
I am sorry I did not make use of my jawing with Frenchmen
in summer to study French pronunciation systematically—
now that I have got some books on phonetics I can see how
weak I am.
 

Please read the enclosed letter and pass it on to Fyodor
Odessky—he did not give me any other address. You ought
to read the letter to know what I want. I have received
the Moscow City Statistics, for which I am grateful. Please
send me the three issues of Moscow City Statistics on the
elections to the First, Second and Third Dumas. I have
also received a letter about statistics from Ryazan—it
is splendid that I shall probably be getting help from many
people.

All the best, do not run around so much, rest more and
keep well. Regards to Mitya. I embrace and kiss Mother.
Happy New Year!

Yours,

V. U.

Dear Manyasha,

I have received your postcard—merci for the news. As
far as the bicycle is concerned I thought I should soon
receive the money, but matters have dragged on. I have a
suit pending and hope to win it. I was riding from
Juvisy[1] when a motorcar ran into me and smashed my bicycle
(I managed to jump off). People helped me take the number
and acted as witnesses. I have found out who the owner
of the car is (a viscount, the devil take him!) and now I
have taken him to court (through a lawyer). I should not
be riding now, anyway, it is too cold (although it’s a good
winter, wonderful for walks).

I am enclosing the exact names of two books on land
allotment that I need very badly. Have you managed to
find anyone who can get them?

All the very best. Kiss Mother for me. Does she find
it very cold in the new flat?

Yours,

V. U.

Dear Manyasha,

I have just received your letter and hasten to scribble an
answer because I am afraid I shall be busy for the next
few
days.[1] I will try to get some information about the man
in German Switzerland. If this is needed in a hurry let me
know exactly when I must find him by, so that the
organisers can begin looking for him themselves (in the event of
my not finding him).

I have received the statistics. A big merci!

Give Anyuta very best regards from me. Mark, too.

I embrace Mother fondly and hope she is well.

How are you? What is the winter like? It is warm here.
I have begun to pay more attention to the theatre; I have
seen Bourget’s new play La barricade. Reactionary but
interesting.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

Dear Manyasha,

I received your letter a few days ago and have been
intending all the time to answer it. I have recently been very
busy with urgent work and have not had a single hour
to spare. I have also received the historian’s letter and
will answer it (if you have an opportunity tell him that),
but cannot do so at the moment (immediately).

I have had a letter from Mitya and was extremely
surprised at the news of his
accident.[3] He says he is getting
better and will soon start learning to walk. Please write
and tell me how he is convalescing. Has he lost his job
or is it still open and will it remain open until he has fully
recovered? When he has recovered will he be able to cover
his territory as before?

You do not write anything about Anyuta and I have not
received anything from her for a long time. Does she like
the new
town?[1]


How is Mother keeping now? Has she recovered from her
influenza?

We have had—and they still continue—floods in Paris
such as have not been known for a long time. You have

    

probably read about it in the newspapers. I managed to get
as far as the Seine on two occasions (horse buses are
running reduced services, the metro and the trams are at a
standstill). The resultant “Venice in Paris” is a truly strange
sight. Many people are out of work. There will probably
be all sorts of accidents, houses collapsing, etc., when the
water subsides.

We are living quietly, no changes. Nadya runs around
to all the schools that teach French and is zealously pushing
ahead. My bicycle case ended in my
favour.[2]

I have received
the Moscow City Statistics—a big merci.

Give Mother many kisses for me. Best regards from all.

Yours,

V. U.

Excuse me for writing so scrappily. My attention is
being distracted.

Dear Anyuta,

We have been having “stormy” times lately, but they
have ended with an attempt at peace with the Mensheviks—
yes, yes, strange as it may seem; we have closed down the
factional newspaper and are trying harder to promote
unity.[1]

We shall see whether it can be done.... I have only just
managed to get rid of a lot of urgent business arising out
of these changes.

Paris is a rotten hole in many respects.... I am still unable
to adapt myself fully to it (after living here for a year!)
but I nevertheless feel that only extraordinary circumstances
could drive me back to Geneva!

February 13, 1910 
 

Dear Mitya,

It is quite a while since I received your letter (and later
Niva with the
problem[1]) and, I am ashamed to say, I
have kept putting off answering. How goes the
convalescence? I hope that doctors are cautious and do not allow
themselves to start work until they have fully recovered. I
have often thought of the danger of accidents when I have
been riding my bicycle through the centre of Paris, where
the traffic is simply hellish. But to fall out like you did,
in the country and in the middle of winter! It must have
been a pretty wild horse and you were probably driving
hell for leather, eh?

Drop me a line to let me know whether you have
recovered. Anyuta wrote that there is a hope of the leg mending
(completely or not? Will you be able to ride a bicycle?)
but not the shoulder. Is that true? I cannot quite believe
that it is absolutely impossible to mend a broken
shoulderblade. You must start a proper course of treatment and
keep it up until you are completely cured.

With regard to Manyasha—I think it would be good for
her to have a longer rest in summer. Mother says the same,
but is afraid she will not be able to drag her out.... She
should, however.

Life here goes on as usual. We live a quiet life. The
weather is fine and I intend to start cycling again since I have

    

won the case and should soon get my money from the owner
of the car.

All the best. Get better soon and properly. We all send
regards.

Yours,

V. U.

February 13, 1910 
 

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I received letters from you and Anyuta.
A big, big merci for them. I have now completed the affairs
that obliged me to answer Manyasha too briefly and hurriedly
(I shall soon be writing to her).

I received the
chessmen[1] a long time ago—I simply
forgot to mention them. I have so few opportunities to
play here that I have probably forgotten everything.

I was very pleased to learn that you are satisfied with
your flat and with the landlady, and that you are better
and have begun to go out. It would be good if you could
get out of Moscow earlier in spring and go to somewhere
on the Volga or to the country. It is sure to be unpleasant
in Moscow in spring.

We are having wonderful weather. The water in the Seine
is still high but the floods are rapidly subsiding; they have
caused tremendous damage (our part of the city was not
touched at all).

I had a short letter from Mitya with the news that he
is recovering. I am angry with myself for not having found
time to answer him. It seems, indeed, that the Paris streets
with their devilish traffic are not the only places where it
is dangerous to ride....

I sometimes see Avgusta Pavlovna here. Her relatives
are in Moscow—do you ever see them? She is very nice.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.

Yours,

V. U.

Best regards from all.

February 17, 1910 
 

Dear Mitya,

I have received your
problem[1]

and got quite “worked
up” about chess—I had forgotten literally everything. It
must be a year since I played and, in general, during the
past few years I have only played a few lightning or very
rapid games. I solved your problem easily—R(Q8)—Q6. But
I saw a problem in Rech today that I could not solve at
once and which I liked very much (the issue of February 1
No. 31 (1269), study No. 195). This is the position.

White: K(KKt3), Kt(KKtl), B(K7), P(KR5), P(Q3)

Black: K(K6), P(KR2), P(Q4), P(QR7) (i.e., the last
pawn is within one move of becoming a queen). White to
play and win. Beautiful bit of work!

How goes the convalescence? Are the leg and the shoulder
both better? Will you soon start walking and driving again?

All the best,


Yours,


V.U.

April 10, 1910 
 

Mother dearest,

I hope you will receive this letter by April 1. I
congratulate you on the occasion of your name day, and Manyasha
as well. A really big hug for you both.

I received your letter with the new address a day or
two ago, and shortly before that I received a letter from
Mitya. I did not know that your old apartment was so far
from the centre. An hour’s tram journey is awful! I have
to travel half an hour by tram from here to the
library[1]

and I find even that too tiring. To travel every day an
hour each way—that is quite impossible. It is a good thing
that you have found an apartment near the Zemstvo

offices.[2]

But, is the air breathable in such places? Isn’t it too
dusty and stuffy? Many thanks for the letter to the
historian; he has been answered.

It would be simply wonderful for us to get together in
August, provided the journey will not tire you too much.
From Moscow to St. Petersburg you must book a sleeper,
and from there to Abo as well. The steamer Bure from Abo
to Stockholm is well equipped; it is in the open sea only
two or three hours and in fine weather it is like sailing
down a river. You can buy return tickets from St.
Petersburg. If the railway journey does not tire you too greatly

    

you will be able to spend a marvellous week in
Stockholm!

We still have not decided whether to take a place in the
country for the summer. We are wavering—is it better to
live en pension as we did last year to give Nadya and Y.V.
a complete rest, or to take a cottage where we should have
to do our own cooking, which Y.V. finds very tiring?

It is spring here. I have already got Nadya’s bicycle
out. We are just longing to be out walking or cycling.
Love and kisses. Keep well. Very best regards to Manyasha.

Yours,

V. U.

May 2, 1910

Dear Anyuta,

Yesterday I received your letter with the new address.
Merci for the congratulations. There is no change at all
here. Nadya is feeling rather poorly—her nerves are still
not quite in order, although by and large we are all well.
I have been cycling for some time and I often go for rides
in the country round Paris, especially as we live quite
near the fortifications, i.e., near the city boundary. We
have not yet decided anything about our summer holidays;
the summer here is a late one and it is possible we shall
again go to Bombon, where there is a cheap
boardinghouse and complete quiet, although Nadya does not seem
inclined to go there again. Perhaps this time we will try
the socialist colony at the
seaside.[1]

Y.V. was there last
year and liked it.

Give my best regards to the neighbour at
Alakayevka[2]

if you manage to see him. It is a pity that he is such a
convinced enemy of correspondence because it would be
pleasant to have some news, if only rarely, from “the heart
of Russia” about what is going on in the new village. There
is little information on this subject and it would be very
pleasant just to have a chat with some knowledgeable person.

Regards to the North
Manchurian[3]

also. How is he
getting fixed up now, and will he rid himself of the “weakness”
of the Russians ... and not only of writers?...
 

With regard to my grudge against the
doctor[4]

(whom
you asked me to do something to help) you were quite wrong,
or perhaps I accidentally said something tactless. I have
never had and still do not have the slightest grudge against
him. He makes a good impression. We never got to know
each other closely. Now he has moved out of town, where
the children will be better off. He is in very poor
circumstances; he has only just managed to find some temporary
work for the tiniest imaginable emolument. I very seldom
see him. The émigrés here are very poor.

My work is going extremely badly. I hope to get over
this period of intense
squabbling[5] and will then return
to my work.

All the best. Regards to Mark. Best wishes from all.

Yours,

V. U.

Dear Anya,

I received your letter about our acquaintance a long
time ago and answered it immediately in a letter to
Manyasha. I have certain reasons for thinking that my letter was
lost, although Manyasha answered one of the questions
raised in it. I asked her to write and say whether she had
received that letter but she hasn’t written. The acquaintance
to whom you asked me to show the letter is not here now and,
furthermore, what I wrote to you was not said to him but
to another person. I will write in detail in a few days. Many
kisses. Regards to M.T. Mother sends regards.

N. K.

Mother dearest,

Greetings to you, Anyuta and Mitya from our Sunday
excursion. Nadya and I are cycling. Meudon Forest is a
good place and close by, 45 minutes from
Paris.[2] I have
received and answered Anyuta’s letter. A big hug from
myself and Nadya.

Yours,

Notes
 
 



[1]
The picture postcard of Meudon Forest was sent to Lenin’s mother
who at that time was staying with Lenin’s brother Dmitry, a rural
doctor in the village of Lipitino, near Mikhnevo Station,
Serpukhov Uyezd, Moscow Gubernia.





[2]
In her memoirs, Nadezhda Krupskaya wrote: “Meudon is a small
town some nine kilometres from Paris. Thousands of Parisians
go there on holidays in summer to spend their time in the open
air. We often went there on weekdays, to cheer ourselves up and
to race through the marvellous woods of Meudon on our bicycles.”

Dear Manyasha,

Greetings from me and Nadya. We are on an outing
in Meudon Forest. Marvellous! I received your letter (the
big one) in the evening of the day I sent you my letter.
And so everything has been received. We shall write and
send you the latest books.

Salut et fraternité.[1]

Yours,


V. U.

Best regards from Naples. I arrived here by steamer

January 3, 1911 
 

Dear M.T.,

Many thanks for your letter. One feels so cut off here
that your stories of impressions and observations of the
Volga (how I miss the Volga!) are manna from heaven.
Your observations are of the greatest interest because they
tell me about the various people you meet in the way of
business and on journeys and because you made them
without any preconceived aim. I was also very pleased to
get your letter in the summer and I am very much at fault
for not having found time to answer it, but that was
because of moving from the seaside to Paris and from Paris
to Copenhagen and Stockholm.

As regards my trip to Italy—it seems that it will not
come off now (or in the near future). Finances (Anya asked
me about them, by the way) do not permit it. I have not
found a
publisher.[1] I sent an article to Sovremenny
Mir,[2]
but apparently there are difficulties there, too; several
weeks have passed and there has been no answer. Long
journeys will have to be put off until better times. It is,
of course, only a stone’s throw from here to Italy and you
simply must pay a visit to Paris if you intend going to Italy.
I suppose it is not for nothing that people say that if you
have once been to Paris you will be drawn to it again.

Manyasha would certainly do better to take a longer
rest in Saratov and not hurry off anywhere, it would be
better in all respects.

Life here goes on as usual. Very little that is pleasant.
The recent period has been so “squabblesome” that I must
ask you to forgive me for unpunctuality in correspondence;

    

I have not answered Anyuta, who told me of the
unsuccessful talks with
Lvovich,[3] and I have not written to Mother
for a long time. Now at least you have almost the entire
family gathered together, so please make my excuses, give
my best regards to Anya and Manyasha and kiss Mother
many times.

All the very best,


Yours,


V. U.

In Stockholm Mother told me about your fight with your
boss. Since funds have gone up you must have won!
Congratulations! Get rid of everything unpleasant!

Happy New Year! A Happy New Year to everyone!

Yesterday I received Zvezda No. 1 from Russia and today
Mysl No.
1.[4] That is something to cheer me up! I hope
you have seen it! It really is a pleasure!

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin was trying to End a publisher for one of his works on the
agrarian question—either “The Agrarian Programme of
Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution, 1905–1907” or “The
Agrarian Question in Russia Towards the Close of the
Nineteenth Century” (see Collected Works, Vol. 13, pp. 217–431, and
Vol. 15, pp. 69–147).





[2]
It is not known which article Lenin refers to here. No article by
him was published in Sovremenny Mir in that period. We have,
however, the evidence of Bonch-Bruyevich that an article of
Lenin’s was discussed by the editors (see Anna
Ulyanova-Yelizarova’s preface to Lenin’s “Letters to Relatives (1910–1916)”
in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No. 4 for 1930).

Sovremenny Mir (Contemporary World)—a literary, scientific
and political monthly published in St. Petersburg from October
1906 to 1918.





[3]
This apparently refers to talks on the publication of Lenin’s
agrarian articles by G. F. Lvovich, who in 1905–06 published
Lenin’s translation of Karl Kautsky’s Bernstein und das
sozialdemokratische Programm. Eine Antikritik (Bernstein and the
Social-Democratic Programme. A Counter-critique). Lenin’s translation
of part of the book was published under the title of K. Kautsky.
Sbornik statei (Collection of Articles). The second edition stated
that it was “Translated by Lenin”.





[4]
Zvezda (Star)—a Bolshevik legal newspaper published in St.
 Petersburg from December 16 (29), 1910 to April 22 (May 5), 1912.
The newspaper Nevskaya Zvezda was a direct continuation of
Zvezda and was launched because of the frequent confiscation of
the latter. These newspapers published about 50 of Lenin’s
articles. Zvezda enjoyed great prestige among factory and other
workers in Russia; it prepared the way for Pravda, the Bolshevik mass
legal newspaper.

Mysl (Thought)—a legal Bolshevik monthly dealing with
philosophical, economic and social problems; it was published in
Moscow from December 1910 to April 1911—five issues in all. It
was founded on Lenin’s initiative to combat the liquidators’
legal publications and to train advanced workers and intellectuals
in the spirit of Marxism. The first four issues of the journal carried
six articles by Lenin.

Mother dearest,

We have just received your letter. Nadya thanks you
very much for it and sends her regards. As for me, I am
hurrying to correct the misunderstanding which, it seems,
I was the unwitting cause of. Please do not send me any
money. I am not now in need. I wrote that neither my book
nor my article had been accepted—that was in one of my
recent letters. But in the last letter I wrote that they say
that my article will be accepted. I have written to
Gorky[1]

about the book and hope for a favourable reply. In any
case my situation is not now any worse; at the moment
I am not in need. I beg you, my dear, not to send anything
and not to try to save anything from your pension. If things
get bad I will write quite frankly, but at the moment they
are not. It is not easy to find a publisher, but I shall keep
on seeking—furthermore, I continue to receive the “sala-
ry”[6] I told you about in Stockholm. So please do not.
worry.

Nadya has written twice to Manyasha and will write
today for the third
time.[2]

Does Manyasha get the letters?
 

I am very glad that Mitya sends good news about his

transfer.[3]

Best regards to Mark and Anyuta from all of us here.

We are all quite well. No changes to report. Yesterday
I delivered a lecture here on Tolstoi—I shall perhaps
deliver the lecture in several Swiss
towns.[4]


The weather here is not bad. Dry and cold (our
apartment is very warm) and it is pleasant out walking.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Tanya’s mother in Moscow has been taken

April 8, 1911 
 

Mother dearest,

You will probably receive this letter on the Russian
April 1. On the occasion of your name day I congratulate
you and Manyasha. I hope you will soon be
well—completely recovered. Today I saw the
doctor[1]

—the

father of
Anyuta’s “godson”—and he says that after an attack of
lumbago you have to take great care of yourself to prevent
a relapse. By the way—his wife and children intend coming
to Russia, but for the summer they want to go to the
country.

I received your letter describing life in Saratov and
expressing some ideas about Manyasha, my dear. Do not
worry in advance, perhaps things may turn out quite
differently from what you imagine by the time summer is over.

Where are you thinking of spending the summer? In
Saratov itself? Is it a good place for the summer?

For a week we have had real winter weather here, snow
and frost. Now there has been a new turn to spring. Y.V.
caught cold in the frosty weather and is in bed. In general
everything goes on as usual, we are leading a quiet life.
Unfortunately there is little news from Manyasha. How
does she feel? Best regards to her and to everybody.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.

Yours,

V. Ul.

Her Excellency Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,

Russia

Mother dearest,

A few days ago we received another present from you,
fish, caviare and smoked sturgeon fillets. A big merci.
We are greatly enjoying these dainties and thinking of the
Volga as we eat them. You really have been plying us with
dainties from home this year!

How are you getting on? To judge by the newspapers
it is cold and snowing where you are. It is spring here.
A week ago I got my bicycle out again and went to the Bois
des Verrières (that is where Manyasha went) and brought
back some bursting willow buds. I went there again today
with Nadya—the cherries are already in bloom. We are
having spring weather but it’s not reliable, there is a lot
of rain.

Where are you off to in summer? Y.V. thinks of going
to Russia but I do not expect she will. We are thinking
of sending her to friends of ours in Arcachon in the south
of France.

Are you all well? I embrace you fondly, my dear. Best
regards to Anyuta, Manyasha and Mark and also to Mitya.

Yours,

V. U.

Nadya and Y.V. send best regards.

Anna Ilyinichna Yelizarova,


Ugodnikovskaya Street, 26,


Saratov

I have been sitting at home lately working on a

translation[1]

and have seen little of what is going on in Paris.
Among our people here, by the way, there is more bickering
and abuse of each other than there has been for a long time—
there probably never has been so much before. All the groups
and sub-groups have joined forces against the last
conference and those who organised it, so that matters even went
as far as fisticuffs at meetings
here.[2]

In short, there is so little here that is interesting or even
pleasant that it’s not worth writing.

 
Notes
 

[1]
It is not known which translation Lenin refers to.—Ed.
 



[2]
After all the attempts of the liquidators, Trotskyites and
conciliators to prevent the Prague Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. had
been defeated, they launched a savage campaign against the
decisions of the conference in order to discredit them.

The Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.
was convened by the Bolsheviks; it was held from January 18
to January 30,1912; it expelled the Menshevik liquidators from the
Party and strengthened the Party as a nation-wide organisation;
the conference laid down the political line and tactics of the Party
in the new period of revolutionary upsurge, and elected the. Central
Committee. A Russian Bureau of the C.C. was set up to guide the
work in Russia.

April 7, 1912 
 

Mother dearest,

You will probably receive this letter about April 1 (Old
Style). I congratulate you and Manyasha on the occasion
of your name day; I embrace you fondly and wish you
everything of the best.

What is spring on the Volga like this year? Are you all
keeping well? I have got into the habit of looking every
day in Rech to see what the weather in Saratov is like and
I see that it is still cold.

It seems that we are having an early spring here this
year. Some days ago I again went cycling in the woods—
the fruit trees in the orchards are all covered in white, “as
though bathed in milk”, and such a wonderful perfume—a
really delightful spring! It is a pity I cycled alone; Nadya
has caught cold, has lost her voice and has to stay at home.

In summer we intend going to Fontenay, near Paris,
and are thinking of moving there
altogether.[1] Paris is
expensive, rents have gone up. Besides, it will probably
be healthier and quieter in the suburbs. I want to go and
look for something soon.

We expected a long letter from Manyasha, but did not
get one. I am sending her a prospectus, all that I could
find. How are Mark and Anya keeping? What news is there
from Mitya?

Again many kisses and best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin did not move at that time. On June 23, 1912 he and his
family moved from Paris to Krakow, so that Lenin could
maintain closer contact with Russia and give better guidance to the
work of the Bolshevik Duma group and the newspaper Pravda.

May 27, 1912 
 

Mother dearest,

I returned to Paris yesterday from a short business
trip[1]
and found your letter with the bad news about Anya
and
Manyasha.[2] I am sure they will not be able to hold
them long because the absurdity of such an arrest is
obvious. Things have come to such a pass that they say straight
out to Anyuta “Not for long!” In the provinces today
they probably pick up people for no reason at all, “just
in case”.

Have you any acquaintances, my dear? Does anybody
visit you? Sudden loneliness is the worst thing that can
happen at such times. Do you get letters and news from
Mitya and Mark?

Have you any acquaintances in St. Petersburg? It would
be a good idea to write to them, if there are any, and tell
them about what has happened, perhaps they can get some
information. Sometimes the provincial administration is
overzealous, especially now, after May Day.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well
and active.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. We have not yet decided what to do for the summer.
It isn’t hot yet.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
It has  not been  established where  Lenin   went.   According to
G. M. Vyazmensky, Director of the Archives of Russian
Social-Democracy in Berlin, Lenin visited the archives in summer of
1912 and saw there the Izvestia TsK R.S.D.R.P. (Bulletin of
the C.C.,   R.S.D.L.P.) for  1907, which he had been looking for
over a long period. It is possible that the journey of which Lenin
speaks was to Berlin.





[2]
On May 7, 1912 Lenin’s sisters Maria and Anna were arrested in
Saratov in connection with the case of the Saratov R.S.D.L.P.(B.).

June 2, 1912 
 

Mother dearest,

A few days ago I wrote to you about the arrest of
Manyasha and Anyuta. There is something else I want to talk
to you about. I am afraid you must feel very lonely now.
I asked in my last letter whether any acquaintances
visit you but I could not have received an answer to that
letter yet.

I read in a St. Petersburg newspaper today about the
large number of arrests and house searches that have been
made in connection with the case of the
railwaymen[1]
in Saratov. They seem to be picking up people left and
right.... I don’t know whether you have yet managed to
get any news of Manya and Anyuta. You will probably
be seeing Anyuta soon, because when they arrested
her they said it would not be for long. If the arrests
are on a very big scale, however, it may take some
time simply to sort out all the people who have been
arrested.

Please drop me a line, my dear, to let me know if you
are well, how you are feeling, and if there is any news and
whether you have any acquaintances in Saratov. Perhaps
you will feel a little less miserable if we write to one
another more often.

There are no changes here. Yesterday we undertook an
excursion to the Parc de St. Cloud, but we had bad luck—

    

it rained. The weather in general is not hot and we have
not yet decided anything about summer.

Nadya and Yel. Vas. send you many kisses and wish
you good health and good spirits. So do I and embrace
you, my dear.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The newspaper Rech for May 17 (30), 1912 carried the following
telegram: “Saratov, May 16. The houses of 18 railway employees
were searched.” An earlier issue, of May 10 (23), had stated:
“Saratov, May 9. The gendarmerie searched 16 houses and made as
many arrests, mainly among workers.”

July 1, 1912 
 

Mother dearest,

I received your letter about the trip up the Volga and
the Kama and your new address. I must give you a new
address, too. This summer we have moved a long way
from Paris—to Krakow. Almost in Russia! Even the Jews
are like Russians and the Russian frontier is 8 versts away
(the journey by train from Granice to here takes two hours,
from Warsaw 9 hours), the women go barefoot and wear
brightly-coloured clothes, exactly as in Russia. My address
here is:

Herrn Wl. Ulijanow,
Zwierzyniec, L. 218,
Krakau, Oesterreich.


I wish you and Anyuta a good holiday and a pleasant
journey up the Volga. The hot weather is beginning and it
must be good to be on the river.

With regard to Manyasha—it is to be hoped that after
what they told you they will not be able to hold her very
long.

Regards to Mark!

Please send me Mitya’s address, my dear.

Getting settled here is taking up a lot of our time. For
the summer we are living out of town, near a summer resort
called “Salwator”. We cannot yet speak Polish. Many
difficulties and much bother.

Y.V. is ill. Looks like pneumonia.
 

I embrace you fondly, my dear; give Anya my very best
regards.

Y.V. and N.K. send regards and embrace you.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Dear Manyasha,

Many thanks for the
photographs[1]

and the letter. At
long last! How are you feeling now?

I am not surprised that you have chosen the
north,[3]
I would probably have done the same myself. I hope that
they will not send you too far away—there are some nasty
places there. Please write as soon as you arrive.

We have been having a lot of trouble during the past
few days and so I could not answer you immediately.

This place is full of rumours of war, as, by the way,
you can see from the papers. If there is a war I shall probably
have to move to Vienna (or to that town where I last saw

you).[2]

But I do not believe there will be a war.

I kiss you fondly, my dear. So do Y.V. and Nadya.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

P. S. Write and tell me whether you will be receiving
Neue Zeit.

Dear Anyuta,

I was very glad to hear from you. Your hand must have
been very painful for a long time—your writing is still
weak.

Here we feel much better than we did in Paris—our
nerves are at rest and there is more literary work and less
squabbling. I hope it will be easier for us to meet, too—
as long as there is no war; I do not greatly believe there
will be one.

I receive very occasional news from Gorky, who is now
less unfriendly in his attitude towards us than he was.

How are Mark and Mitya?

Give Mother many, many kisses from me.

Here we are having wonderful autumn weather, and we
go out a lot.

Material conditions are so far bearable but not very
reliable.... If anything happens I will write to you.

All the best and excuse the hurry.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Y.V. and Nadya ask me to send their regards and
kisses. Both are well.

Mother dearest,

Please excuse me for the delay in answering your last
letter; I have already received a second. Nadya will write
you in detail about our way of
life.[1]


We still have no news of Manyasha. Send her Nadya’s
letter and mine if they are of interest to her.

I do not think you need worry about her; Vologda is
better than Astrakhan as far as climate is concerned (infectious
diseases are worse and more dangerous in Astrakhan); she
will make friends with people. After all, the town is not far
from Petersburg and Moscow. The St. Petersburg papers
probably arrive only a day late.

It is difficult to arrange for any translation work; some
contact must be established with publishers in Moscow or
St. Petersburg. Nadya suggests what I think is a good
idea write to the
Sabashnikovs.[2]

Perhaps Anyuta will also
write to Krumbügel (if it is possible), etc. I, alas, have no
contacts with publishers.

How is it that Mark is so often ill? That’s no good! He
should take a rest in summer, for instance, in the
mountains—four hours’ journey from here there is Zakopane,
they say it is a wonderful place in the mountains.

We are not thinking of moving; unless the war chases
us away, but I do not greatly believe in the war. We shall
wait and see.
 

Best regards to Mitya and Anyuta. How is her finger?
It is time it was cured!

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.

Yours,

V. Ul.

Her Excellency Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova,


Poste Restante,


Vologda,


Russia

Dear Manyasha,

At last a brief note from you, very brief, it is true, has
reached me. Write and tell me how you have settled down,
whether you have made any friends, and whether there is
any possibility of your finding work. Have the local
authorities kept their promise not to prevent your looking for
a
job?[1]


I recently received a letter from Mother who tells me that
Mark came back from St. Petersburg ill. Why is he so poorly
these days? What was he like when you left—was he, on
the whole, well?

I suppose you are now suffering from “prison anaemia”,
or rather from a worsening of your former anaemia. You
ought to do something about it—go skating, for instance.
That is something you must do, so do not neglect it! There
is slush where I am now, but last year, when I found
myself in a “cold” place, I immediately found a skating
rink and had a go to see whether I had forgotten how to
skate.

There are now great difficulties in the way of getting
translations from French and German because of the copy-

    

right convention. In this place, unfortunately, I am cut off
from all contact with publishers. You should write to St.
Petersburg or Moscow, if you have any acquaintances there,
and try to find out from the publishers how they stand;
translation is the best form of employment and quite a
large number of translated books are published. Write
and tell me what the prospects are. 

Y.V. and Nadya are very anxious to send regards.

All the best,


Yours,


V. Ul.

December 28, 1912

I have received the letter with your address, dear Manyasha,
and hasten to reply. Did you get the letter I sent you
Poste Restante? 
 

We could probably arrange to send you the journal
Gleichheit,[1]
which is published fortnightly. It is merely a matter
of whether the censor will allow it. Try to find out—or
should we just send it? 

When do you receive the St. Petersburg newspapers?
A day late or later? 

A thousand good wishes and regards to all friends. 

Ever yours,


Vl. U.

(December 21) January 3, 1913 
 

Mother dearest,

Today I received letters from you and Anyuta. A big
merci.

The compliments of the season to all of you! May you
all have a good time and keep well and cheerful.

Today I also got a picture postcard from Manyasha with
a view of the River Vologda. Not a bad little town, judging
by the postcard.... She writes that she has settled in there
quite well.

If Mitya is with you give him my best regards. And
the same to Mark. I hope he is better by now.

Anyuta is still writing badly! What a nuisance that
finger is!

We are all well. We intend to celebrate the Russian
festivals more than the local ones.

I embrace you fondly and wish you all the best.

Yours,

V. Ul.

Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova,


Tsarevskaya, 36,


Saratov,[1]

Russia

Mother dearest,

I received two parcels today. What a mountain of sweets
you sent us! A big merci from us all. Nadya is quite cross
with me because I wrote “about the fish”, and about sweets,
and because I have caused you so much trouble. I did not
expect that everything would be in such gigantic
quantities.... The duty on fish is not very high but for sweets it
is quite a lot. And so we are now going to celebrate “New
Year” again!

How are you two managing without Mark? The
newspapers say that political exiles may get an amnesty. Let us
wait until
February 21....[2]


We are having wonderful winter weather without snow.
I have bought some skates and skate with great enthusiasm—
it brings back Simbirsk and Siberia. I have never before
skated abroad.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send best regards
to Anyuta. So do Y.V. and Nadya.

Yours,

V. Ul.
 

P.S. The number of our house has been changed, it is
now Ulica Lubomirskiego, 49.




Dear Anyuta,

I had just written to Mother about the parcels when
the letter from you both arrived. I am glad that Mark is
pleased with his travelling—I hope he will be better off
in Siberia. If you go to see
Mitya[3]

I hope you will call on
us—it is almost on your way, the deviation is a very small
one. If you did not have to pay a high stamp duty on
passports it would be quite cheap; only those who live near
the frontier can come here without passports, with “half
passes” that cost 30 kopeks.

We live modestly, no changes.... We are drawing up
plans for the publication of pamphlets at
Pravda....[4]
I do not know whether we shall be able to manage it, but
there is a demand for it.

Manyasha writes occasionally. She still has not found
any work.

What we are most badly off for here is Russian books!
And there’s nothing we can do about it.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

 
Notes
 

[1]
The address is taken from a copy found, in a dossier of the Police
Department.—Ed.

[2]
Lenin refers to the amnesty granted on the occasion of the
tercentenary of the House of Romanov.—Ed.

[3]
Lenin’s brother Dmitry was at that time employed as public
health officer in Feodosia, Crimea.—Ed.
 



[4]
Pravda(The Truth)—the legal Bolshevik daily that was
launched in St. Petersburg on April 22 (May 5), 1912.

Pravda was under Lenin’s ideological guidance; he wrote for
it almost daily and sent instructions to the editors. Some 270
articles by Lenin were published in Pravda; Gorky, too, published
his stories in Pravda.

The newspaper was suppressed by the tsarist authorities eight
times but continued to appear under changed names—Rabochaya
Pravda, Severnaya Pravda, Pravda Truda, Za Pravdu,
Proletarskaya Pravda, Put Pravdy, Rabochy, Trudovaya Pravda
 (Workers’ Truth, Northern Truth, Truth of Labour, For Truth,
Proletarian Truth, The Path of Truth, The Worker, Labour Truth). Under
these difficult conditions the Bolsheviks succeeded in publishing
636 issues of Pravda in a little over two years. On July 8 (21),
1914, the newspaper was finally suppressed and did not re-appear
until the February bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1917.

Beginning from March 5 (18), 1917, Pravda was published as
the organ of the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee
of the R.S.D.L.P. On April 5 (18), on his return from abroad,
Lenin joined the editorial board and became its leading figure.
From July to October 1917 Pravda was constantly persecuted by
the counter-revolutionary bourgeois Provisional Government,
and frequently changed its name: Listok Pravdy, Proletary,
Rabochy, Rabochy Put (The Pravda Sheet, The Proletarian, The
Worker, The Workers’ Path). On October 27 (November 9),
following the October Revolution, the Central Organ of the Party again
appeared under its old name of Pravda.

Dear Anyuta,

It is quite a while since I had news of you. Is Mother
keeping well? Have you received the letter I sent
immediately on receiving the “goodies”?

It seems that the amnesty did not affect the exiles in
Vologda at all....[1]

Is there any news from Mitya or Mark in their new places?

Do you know the address of Krumbügel—he published
my book on philosophy? Is it possible to get hold of him
(if you tell me how to find him I can probably get an
acquaintance in Moscow to do it) and find out whether there
are any unsold copies of the book left? We could now
probably find another means of disposing of them and could
come to an agreement on the subject with the publisher.

All the best, kiss Mother for me.

Yours,

V. Ul.

P.S. Our address is now Lubomirskiego No. 49 (and
not 47).

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
It was the general rule to reduce the term of exile by one-third
in the event of an amnesty, but only for those exiles who received
a favourable report from the local administration. Most of the
Vologda exiles were amnestied.

Dear Manyasha,

Congratulations on the occasion of your and Mother’s
name day. I hope you will soon be spending the summer
months with more company and in more healthy
surroundings.

Many thanks for the letter. I was very glad to get the
news and will try to write again in a day or two. Forgive
me for breaking off so soon, but I am in a great hurry.

Regards to friends. All the best.

May 3 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

We have received your postcards and I am very glad
to know that you are having a good rest. Here, too, it is
real summer. Today we sent our things off to the country.
Our new address is

Villa Terezy Skupie&nacute,


Poronin,


Galizien,

.........


Austria.

We shall be leaving in three days. The packing was an
awful nuisance but as we are going to Poronin for five
months we had to buy everything. I am quite invalided and
tire very quickly. I have been going for electric treatment
for a whole month, the swelling in my neck has not gone
down but my eyes have become more normal and the
palpitation is less. Treatment is free here in the nerve clinic
and the doctors are very attentive. There is another
advantage. While you are waiting your turn, you hear Polish
spoken and speak yourself. I certainly want to learn Polish.
In summer I shall have spare time and will read Polish
books. We shall probably have a help in for four or five
hours a day in summer and I shall have less to bother about.
Mother did not go to Russia. Partly because of my illness
and partly because there was no one to accompany her. But
mostly because of my illness. In the last few days she has
grown very tired from all the commotion in the house.

    

Volodya has been away and was not home for his birthday
or for the holidays. The journey made a good break
for him.[1]

I do not yet know whether there is anywhere to bathe
in Poronin. Volodya is very fond of bathing—there will
be no bath there and he will not be able to take a shower.

I want to get to the country as soon as possible. We
live on the outskirts of the town, there are market gardens
opposite our windows and the day before yesterday a
nightingale was singing, but still it is a town, the children
shout, soldiers are riding to and fro and the carts are noisy.

Well, I embrace you and Anya fondly and send regards
to all. Is it possible that Anya’s finger still hurts?

Mother sends regards.

Yours,

Nadya

Mother dearest,

I am adding a couple of words to Nadya’s letter. I must
apologise for not having written, but I have been away
for a couple of days and now we are moving.

Many thanks to Mitya for the
letter.[2] I have also
received a very long and interesting letter from Mark. I will
reply to it from Poronin.

Poronin is the station before Zakopane (a spa). There
are direct coaches to Zakopane—from Warsaw second class
and from Granice third class.

I embrace you fondly and send best regards to all.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s trip was apparently undertaken in connection with the
lecture on “The Social Upswing in Russia and the Tasks of
Social-Democracy”, which he delivered on April 26, 1913 in Leipzig.





[2]
The letter contained the medical advice given to Lenin by his
brother for the treatment of Nadezhda Krupskaya. Lenin’s letter
has been lost but its contents are known from a letter written by
his mother to her daughter Maria on April 30, 1913. “I have just
received a letter from Volodya in which he also wrote to Mitya
to inform him that in spite of electric treatment for three weeks,
Nadya’s eyes, neck and heart are no better.... Acquaintances
advise him to take her to Kocher in Berne, a first-class specialist
on such illnesses—it can be cured, they say, but it is dangerous
to neglect it, the illness is a serious one and later it will become
hopeless.... Volodya is in great difficulty—should they abandon
the cottage they have now moved to, which is on a mountain,
and there is the excellent mountain air she was told was good for

   

her, or take her to Kocher, who is a surgeon and will probably
want to operate; many people say that operations in such cases
are difficult and the outcome is doubtful.... So Volodya asks
Mitya’s advice.... Mitya was not here when the letter arrived, he
came two days later, read the letter, got out his medical books,
copied out something from them, consulted someone here and
only yesterday sent an answer by registered post.”

Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova,


Yekaterininsko-Dvoryanskaya Street, 40,


Vologda,


Russia

Dear Manyasha,

I believe I am in debt to you (to Mark Timofeyevich
I most certainly am). At long last I have settled down
to write. We moved here a few days ago (partly because
of Nadya’s illness—she has thyroid trouble which worries
me greatly) to spend the summer in the village of Poronin,
in the mountains seven kilometres from Zakopane. It is
near the Tatra
Mountains,[1]

6--8 hours by rail to the south
of Krakow and communication with Russia and Europe
is through that town. It is farther from Russia, but that
can’t be helped.

We have rented a country house (a huge one, far too
big!) for the whole summer up to October 1 (New Style) and
after a lot of bother and bustle have moved. I think Nadya is
worse from the moving. I shall probably have to take her
to Berne for treatment....

This is a marvellous place. The air is wonderful—the
altitude is about 2,300 feet. Our rather damp situation
on the plains at Krakow cannot be compared to it. We have
plenty of newspapers and can work.
 

The local people are Polish peasants, “Hurals”
(mountaineers), with whom I
converse[2]

in incredibly broken
Polish, a language of which I know five words, and the
rest in distorted Russian. Nadya speaks a little Polish
and can read the language. The villages are almost Russian
in type. Thatched roofs, poverty. The women and children
go barefoot. The men wear the Hural costume, white cloth
trousers and coats, half jacket and half cape, of the same
material. This is not a holiday resort (Zakopane is) and,
therefore, very quiet. I still hope that Nadya will get better
in the quiet and the mountain air. We have started leading
the rural life here—we get up early and go to bed almost
with the roosters. We walk every day to the post office and
the station.

Do you see Pravda and Prosveshcheniye
regularly?[4] The
people here were glad to see the anniversary
issue[5] and
to hear of the metalworkers’ victory over the
liquidators.[6]

How are you? Will you be able to keep your lessons for
the summer? Do you get enough books?

Greetings to Polish
friends,[3]

and I hope they help you
in every way....

Y.V. and Nadya send regards and kisses. I too.

Yours,

V. U.

Address: Herrn Ulianow, Oesterreich, Poronin (Galizien).

P.S. You had better send this letter to Mother, unless
she will be visiting you soon.

 
Notes
 

[1]
The Tatras are part of the Carpathians, 8,500 feet high. Pure
Switzerland!—Lenin

[2]

(I prefer talking to Jews—in German).—Lenin

[3]
Lenin refers to V.V. Vorovsky who was in exile in Vologda.—Ed.
 



[4]
Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment)—a Bolshevik legal journal
dealing with questions of theory published monthly in St. Petersburg
from December 1911 to June 1914. Its circulation reached 5,000
copies.

The journal was founded on Lenin’s initiative in place of the
Bolshevik journal Mysl, formerly published in Moscow and
suppressed by the authorities.

On the eve of the First World War Prosveshcheniye was
prohibited by the tsarist government. In the autumn of 1917 the
journal was restarted, but only one issue (a double number)
appeared; it contained two articles by Lenin, “Can the Bolsheviks
Retain State Power?” and “The Revision of the Party
Programme”.





[5]
The anniversary issue of Pravda (No. 92) appeared on April 23
(May 6), 1913. The issue carried two articles by Lenin,   “The
Pravda Anniversary. Workers Support the Workers’ Paper” and
“A Few Words on Results and Facts”.





[6]
The elections to the Executive of the St. Petersburg Metalworkers’
Union took place on April 21 (May 4), 1913. Some 800 persons
attended the meeting and over 400 were unable to get into   the
overcrowded hall. The Bolsheviks put forward a list of candidates
for election that had been published in Pravda No. 91 and
distributed among those present at the meeting. Despite the insistence
on the part of the liquidators to elect candidates irrespective
of political allegiance, the majority of those present voted for the
Pravda list; 10 out of 14 members of the   Executive were elected
from the Bolshevik list.  The  newly elected Executive sent   a
telegram to Lenin greeting him as “the true leader of the working
class”.

May 25 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

We received your letter today. I hasten to reply to it.

I am getting better now. The palpitation has become
less violent. I am following the doctor’s advice and eating
enough for three, guzzling milk and taking Robin’s thyroid
medicine and, in genera], everything is fine. Volodya gets
very worked up, people worry him a lot about Kocher. I
am very glad that D. I. has written him a letter telling him
that there is no need for an operation, etc., because people
are talking all sorts of nonsense to him—that I may go
blind, that I should lie motionless for eighteen months and
so on. I have not got the disease in such an advanced stage
and I shall recover in the summer.

Our real holiday is only just beginning. There was a
terrible hurly-burly over the moving, and here at first we
had to haggle. The people here have been spoiled by
holiday-makers—they lie, swindle, etc. At first we were angry
at this, but now everything is in its place. A girl comes
to us; she cannot cook, but does all the household chores.
Today the weather shows signs of changing; so far we have
had a whole week of rain, but the place does not seem damp.
This morning Volodya and I walked for about two hours,
and now he has gone off alone to some indefinite point in
space.

Every morning a fluffy black pup comes running to us
from the neighbour’s and Volodya spends a lot of time
playing with it. This is the real summer cottage routine.

There is only one family here with whom we are

    

acquainted and they live a long way away, half an hour’s
walk. But that does not prevent us from seeing each other,
sometimes twice a day.

I am glad there are no crowds here. I do a minimum
amount of work. I read mostly Polish novels, and not very
enthusiastically at that.

It is very beautiful here. Fortunately you cannot do a
lot of cycling, because Volodya used to abuse that
amusement and overtire himself; it is better to walk more.

Mother sends regards. She is still feeling miserable—
her sister with whom she was brought up and with whom
she had maintained close relations all her life, died a
fortnight ago. Mother even wanted to go to Novocherkassk
when she heard of her sister’s illness, but she had no
passport—it had been sent in for renewal.

Many kisses for Anya, and regards to all. Volodya will
probably write himself. I embrace you fondly, my dear.

Yours,

Nadya

Mother dearest,

I embrace you fondly and send regards to all. Many thanks
to Mitya for the letters. I am trying to persuade Nadya to
go to Berne. She does not want to. She is now slightly
better.

Yours,

V. U.

Mother dearest,

I received your letter just before I left. Nadya and I have

I will write to you from Berne. I embrace you fondly,
Anyuta and Manyasha, too. We are travelling comfortably
and have taken a look at Vienna. The weather is fine.

Yours,

Please convey my apologies to M.T. for not answering
his interesting letter. Tell him not to be angry!

Mother dearest,

Nadya and I have been in Berne for several days. Kocher
has not yet received us. He is a difficult person. He’s a
celebrity and likes to be begged. Some competent local
doctors praise him to the skies and promise complete success.
We shall wait. In the meantime write to me c/o Herrn
Schklowsky. (For W. I.) 9. Falkenweg. Bern. Switzerland.

We shall probably have to spend a few weeks here.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best
regards to Anyuta and Manyasha. So does Nadya.

Yours,

V. U.

Saturday, July 26, 1913

Mother dearest,

After a fortnight’s “preparation” in the clinic, Nadya
was at last operated on on Wednesday. The operation seems
to have been successful because she looked quite well
yesterday, and had begun to drink willingly. It seems to have
been a rather difficult operation, they tormented Nadya
for about three hours without an anaesthetic, but she bore
it bravely. On Thursday she was very bad, a high
temperature and delirium, so I was pretty scared. But yesterday
there was an obvious improvement, no fever, the pulse was
slower, etc.

Kocher, of course, is a wonderful surgeon, and anyone
with thyroid trouble should go to him; he has a huge
clientele of Russians, of Jews especially.

I am already thinking of the journey back; we expect
to leave on August 4 (unless Kocher delays it, which
sometimes happens) and we shall make overnight stops at
Zurich, Munich and Vienna, and go on home from there.
I shall be here long enough to receive another letter from
you, after which you must write to Poronin. If I am delayed
here I will write again.

The suppression of the paper I wrote
for[1] leaves me in
a very critical position. I shall try harder than ever to find
publishers and translations; it is very difficult at present
to find any literary work.
 

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best
regards to Manyasha and Anya. Nadya sends her fondest
regards.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The paper referred to is Pravda, which the tsarist government
suppressed on July 5, 1913, beginning from issue No. 151. On
July 13 the paper re-appeared under a new name—Rabochaya
Pravda.

Dear Manyasha,

I received your letter a few days after I had posted you
a letter from Nadya and me.

You make me ashamed of myself for my silence. I really
am at fault—there has been a lot of bother over our moving
and because of the influenza. Now Y.V. here is ill—she
has had a very bad attack of influenza but is now recovering.

You ask about new German literature. I have just
finished reading the four volumes of the Marx-Engels
correspondence. I want to write about it in
Prosveshcheniye.[1]
There is much of interest. It is a pity the publishers—
those Bosches!—charge such a price for it—40 marks! I
have not yet read Beer’s new History of Socialism in
England, but I soon shall.

Cunow’s book on the origin of religion appeared recently.
I would send it to you (I can buy it) but I am afraid it
would not reach you. If you receive or can obtain Neue Zeit,
there is a list in it of all the interesting things. I do not see
any new bourgeois literature. If you like I can send you a
list of all new books in German (a small publication I get every
month, it is put out by Hinrichs, a bookseller in Leipzig).
 

All the best. Give Mother many kisses for me and for
Nadya.

Yours,

V. U.

It is a long time since I had word from Anyuta. 
 

I am reading Octave Mirbeau’s Dingo. In my opinion
it is no good.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
In September 1913, four volumes of the Marx-Engels
correspondence were published in German. Lenin planned a big work about
this correspondence, the beginning of which was his article “The
Marx-Engels Correspondence” (see Collected Works, Vol. 19,
pp. 552–58).


In a thick notebook containing 76 pages, now in the Central

   

Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, Central
Committee of the C.P.S.U., Lenin made notes on about 300 letters and
made extracts from 15 that are of theoretical importance; he also
compiled a short thematic index to his notes. The four volumes
on which Lenin worked have been preserved; they have passages
underlined or encircled and also marked N.B. in the margins; the
remarks are made in pencil in four different colours. This material
was published in Moscow as a separate edition in 1959 under
the title of Konspekt “Perepiski K. Marksa i F. Engelsa”

(Conspectus of the Marx-Engels Correspondence).

It had been intended to publish Lenin’s essay in the journal
Prosveshcheniye in 1914 (as reported in Proletarskaya Pravda
on December 14, 1913) but it remained unfinished and was first
published in Pravda on November 28, 1920 on the Occasion of
the centenary of Engels’s birth.

Dear Manyasha,

Under separate cover I am sending you some German
book catalogues. Look them over and drop me a line to
say if there is anything that interests you (when you have
finished with them—there is no hurry—return them).

How are you and Mother getting on? Do you intend
to see Mark or Anya during the holidays? Have you heard
anything from Mitya?

Everything is still the same here; I have already got
thoroughly used to the Krakow way of life—narrow, quiet,
sleepy, but in some respects more convenient than life in
Paris.

Forgive me for not writing often, business interferes.

Give Mother many kisses for me. Nadya and Y.V. also
send regards and kisses.

Yours,

V. U.

December 26 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

It is an age since I last wrote to you. In general I have
been conducting a sort of sit-down strike against letter-
writing lately. Volodya is partly to blame. He has enticed me
into the “excursionist” party. It is our local joke that we
have a “cinemist” party (of cinema-lovers), an “anti-
cinemist”, or “anti-semitic”, party, and an “excursionist” party,
which is always finding excuses for excursions. Volodya is
a confirmed anti-cinemist and an enthusiastic excursionist.
He has recruited me into his party and so I have no time left
for anything. To make things worse, we are having some
wonderfully fine days. With just a light fall of snow—
really excellent. And autumn, too, was fine. After all, what
is there to do in Krakow but go walking. We have no
sophisticated amusements of any kind. We did once go to a
concert, a Beethoven quartet, we even clubbed together
to buy a season ticket, but for some reason the music made
us terribly miserable, although an acquaintance of
ours,[1]

an excellent musician, was in ecstasies over it. We do not
want to go to the Polish theatre, the cinema here is quite
absurd—all five-act melodramas.... Volodya and I have
decided that after the holidays we will begin a study of the
local University library, for, to our shame, we have never
been there. If there is anything we thirst for here it is good
literature. Volodya has practically learned Nadson and
Nekrasov by heart and an odd volume of Anna Karenina
    

is being read for the hundredth time. We left our literature
(a tiny fraction of what we had in St. Petersburg) in Paris
and here there isn’t a Russian book to be had anywhere.
At times we read with envy the advertisements of
secondhand booksellers offering 28 volumes of Uspensky or 10
volumes of Pushkin, etc., etc.

Volodya, as luck would have it, has become a great
fiction-lover. And an out-and-out nationalist. You cannot
get him to look at the pictures by Polish artists at any
price but he has picked up, for instance, a catalogue of
the Tretyakov Gallery that some acquaintance had thrown
away and is always burying himself in it.

We are all well. Volodya takes a cold shower every day,
goes for walks and does not suffer from insomnia. He
continues praising the local swamp. Mother is often unwell,
first a gumboil, then a cough.... She sends her best regards.
I had a letter from Manyasha, but it was in her usual scrawl
so I understood nothing of it. She should write more often.
I embrace her and you most fondly, wish you good health
and everything of the best. Again I kiss you.

Yours,

Nadya

Many kisses, my dear, I wish you good health and
spirits. Very best regards to Manyasha (I wrote to her a few
days ago) and to Anyuta, who is probably with you.

Yours,

V. U.

January 7 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

A Happy New Year to you, Manyasha and Anya, with
all best wishes for everything that is good.

We spent the European New Year’s Eve alone with
Volodya sitting over plates of curds, and the Russian New
Year’s Eve we shall not celebrate at all because Volodya
is going away for a month or six weeks to work in a
library.[1]
I envy him a bit because our place is more like a backwoods
village than a town and I miss people quite a lot. There is
simply no one here to bother about and no one to take
care of.

We do not seem to be able to make acquaintances among
the local inhabitants.

Winter tried hard to get going here, Volodya went
skating three times and tempted me to buy skates, but the
weather suddenly turned warm, all the ice melted, and
today, for instance, there is a real smell of spring in the
air. Yesterday, too, was not at all like winter. Volodya
and I went for a long walk in the country and it was
fine.

That, then, is all our news. I embrace you fondly, Mother
sends regards.

How are your eyes? Did Anya come as she intended to? 
 

Keep well!

Yours,

Nadya
 

Mother dearest,

I embrace you fondly and wish you a Happy New Year—
you, and Manyasha and Anya!

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
In mid-January 1914, Lenin left Krakow for Paris where he spoke
at a meeting of Bolsheviks on the intention of the International
Socialist Bureau to interfere in the affairs of the R.S.D.L.P.,
then at two memorial meetings dedicated to the events of January
9, 1905; he also delivered a lecture on the “Question of
Nationalities” in the Grand Hall of the Geographical Society. From Paris
Lenin went to Brussels to attend the Fourth Congress of the
Social-Democrats of the Latvian Area. He delivered there a
report on behalf of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in
which he criticised the opportunist position of the Latvian
Social-Democrats on questions of the struggle against the
liquidators and took a firm stand against the conciliatory tendencies at
the congress. He delivered a lecture to the delegates on the question
of nationalities in which he outlined the theory and tactics of
the Bolsheviks in this field. After the congress Lenin lectured on
the same issue at Liege and Leipzig, returning to Krakow on
February 6, 1914.

Anna Ilyinichna Yelizarova,


Goncharnaya Street, 11, Apt. 23,


St. Petersburg,


Russia

Dear Anyuta,

At last I am home after a long absence; I found and read
all your letters, and today another one came, the one you
thought might not arrive. We have them all. You were
right about the delay with the articles, but there is nothing
I can do. I have only two hands. Prosveshcheniye No. 1 has
not arrived, although I have received a newspaper with a
notice that it has been published. You are also delaying
things. I am going to write about the self-determination of
nations—perhaps it will be in time for
No. 2.[2]

Please send me Proletarskaya Pravda No. 11 (2 copies),
Put Pravdy No. 2, Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 8
(126)[3]—
do not ask anybody else to send them (that is hopeless)
but send them yourself.

With regard to the summaries of crime statistics for
1905–1908, I would ask you not to buy them (there is no
need, they are expensive) but to get them from a library
(either the Bar Council or the Duma Library) and send
them for a month. (Many thanks for the journal of the
Ministry of Justice—I hope you got it back.) I heard that
you people crossed out of the article on the
X affair[1]
    

something against the liquidators and I was very angry at
this inappropriate and harmful conciliation; you are only
helping the foul slander of the liquidators, delaying the
inevitable process of chucking such scoundrels as Galina,
Martov, Dan and others out of the working-class movement. You
won’t succeed in anything but disgracing yourselves. I am
really mad at the disgusting blackmail engineered by
Martov & Co. in the X affair; we shall gradually crush that gang
of blackmailers.

I have not written home for a long time. I hope everything
is all right there. Drop me a line or two.

I have just received Prosveshcheniye No. 1.
Congratulations. In general it is good. Except for the misprints.... And
the review of Levitsky’s book with the foolish word
“factionally” in
it....[4] Who let that go through? Who is the
author? N.K. will write about the women’s
magazine.[5]

Dear Manyasha,

I recently returned from a trip (among other things,
I lectured on the question of nationalities in
Paris)[1] 
 and still cannot settle down to write.

How are you? When will your term of exile be over?

How is Mother keeping? Has she completely recovered?

It is a long time since I had news of Mark or Mitya. I
know nothing about their way of life or their plans.

There have been no changes here. We still live modestly.
Nadya seems to be in for a relapse of her thyroid trouble—
the symptoms are still mild but they are there. Perhaps I
shall have to take her for another operation in spring....
It is still not certain and it is better so far to say nothing
to her about it. I am quite well, so is Y.V.

All the best. Give Mother many kisses for me.

Yours,

V. U.

Mother dearest,

I have received your postcard—merci. What a difference
between your weather and ours here! Here it is already
spring—there has been no snow for a long time, it is warm,
we do not wear galoshes and the sun is unusually bright
for these parts. We cannot believe that we are in “wet”
Krakow. It is a pity that you and Manyasha have to live
in a nasty little town!... I have been to Paris and not to
London and have had quite a good trip. Paris is a very
unsuitable town for a man of modest means to live in, and
very tiring. But there is no better and more lively town
to stay in for a short time, just for a visit, for an outing. It
made a good change.

In summer we shall probably go to Poronin again.

I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to Manyasha.

Yours,

V. U.

P.S. Nadya and Y.V. also send many kisses.

March 16 
 

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

It is an age since I wrote to you. For some reason it seems
difficult to write this year. We are very lonely here—there
is really only one family in the whole town with whom
we are acquainted. They have an amusing little boy but
we do not see eye to eye with the mother. There is one other
family but their company is painful, they are so worn out
with poverty, so completely crushed. Nor do we get many
letters. We live mostly on newspapers.

The weather here is not bad, the grass is showing green
and so are the buds on the trees, but the mud on the roads
is terrible. Volodya went for quite a long ride on his bicycle but
had a burst tyre. We intend to go for long outings in the woods.
We go walking a little every day—our house is on the very
outskirts of the town and the fields are only five minutes’
walk from us. We have already arranged for the old cottage
in the country and are thinking of moving there on May 1.
The house there is a bit on the big side for us and is a long
way from the shops, but the rooms are very good and have
stoves in them, there are two verandahs, and it is some
distance from the road.

Perhaps I shall recover my breath there. Again I have
thyroid trouble, not as badly as before, my eyes are almost
normal and my neck swells only when I am excited, but
the palpitation is rather bad. Actually the disease does not
yet bother me very much and does not prevent my doing
anything, but it is a bore to have to be careful of everything
and to have to start an invalid routine again. It is damp

    

here in Krakow but in Poronin I shall probably get over
it all very quickly.

Volodya is very fond of Poronin and particularly likes
scrambling up the mountains. This time we intend to take
a servant who will live in, so that there will be no bother
with the housekeeping and we shall be able to go on long
outings.

Anya is spoiling us this year by sending so many books.
Has Manyasha received my letter?

Many kisses for her and for you, my dear.

Mother sends regards. She wanted to go to Russia, but
it is a lot of trouble.

I wish you all the best and hope you keep well.

Yours,

Nadya

Many kisses, Mother dearest, and regards to all. Mitya
as well—many thanks for the letter. I have also had a letter
from Mark. Here we saw the “Beilis
affair”[1] in the
cinema (they made a melodrama of it). We went to the
Shevchenko[2] celebration—it was in Ukrainian. I understand
terribly little Ukrainian. There have been no changes. I
embrace you fondly and hope you keep well.

Yours,

V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Betlis affair—the trial of the Jew Beilis
organised by the
tsarist authorities in Kiev in 1913 for purposes of
provocation;
Beilis was falsely accused of the ritual murder of the Christian
boy Yushchinsky (the boy was actually killed by the Black
Hundreds). By staging this trial the tsarist authorities hoped to arouse
anti-Semitic feelings and by means of anti-Jewish pogroms divert 
 the
masses from the revolutionary movement that was
developing in the
country. The trial aroused tremendous socialunrest;
in many towns there were workers’ protest demonstrations. Beilis
was acquitted by the court.





[2]
Lenin and Krupskaya attended the celebrations in honour of the
centenary of Shevchenko’s birth.

Mother dearest,

I embrace you fondly and congratulate you and
Manyasha on the occasion of your name day. I now hope that
the summer in Vologda will be better than the winter has
been and it is, after all, the last
summer![1]


In these last few days I have caught a slight cold (that
has to happen every spring!) but am now quite well.

Very soon, early in May, we are going to Poronin again.

I embrace you fondly and hope you keep well!

Yours,

V. U.

Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova,


Samarin’s House, Apt. 3,


Moskovskaya Street,


Vologda,


Russia

April 22

Dear Manyasha,

I have had news that you are annoyed at my prolonged
silence. I am indeed at fault as far as letter-writing is
concerned—it is very difficult in our situation (in yours and
in mine especially) to carry on the correspondence one
would like....

Yesterday we received a letter from Mother addressed
to me and to Nadya. Give Mother many kisses for me.
Perhaps you will be better off in summer than in winter.

I recently received information about the exiles at
Olonets. They have collected material about the situation there
and who the exiles are—most of them are workers, new
people (post-revolutionary people), out of 150 people in
the uyezd there are two liquidators and a few Left
Narodniks. Apparently there are great changes in the
composition of the exile groups—it would be of interest to collect
the data and publish them occasionally in

Prosveshcheniye.[1] Nadya has written to you and intends to write
again.

In a fortnight or so we are again going to Poronin—there
are mountains there and I hope that Nadya’s thyroid
trouble will pass—mountain air is good for people suffering

    

from this disease. The weather here is wonderful and I
frequently go cycling.

No matter how provincial and barbarous this town of
ours may be, by and large I am better off here than I was
in Paris. The hurly-burly of life in the émigré colony there
was incredible, one’s nerves got worn down badly and for
no reason at all, Paris is an inconvenient place to work
in, the Bibliothèque nationale is badly organised—we often
thought of Geneva, where work went better, the library
was convenient, and life was less nerve-racking and
timewasting. Of all the places I have been in my wanderings
I would select London or Geneva, if those two places were
not so far away. Geneva is particularly fine for its general
cultural level and the conveniences that make life easier.
Here, of course, there can be no talk of culture—it is
almost the same as Russia—the library is a bad one and
extremely inconvenient, although I scarcely ever have to
go there....

Autumn in the Tatras (the mountains near where we live
in Poronin) is marvellous—at least, last autumn was
delightful after a rainy summer. Your time will be up in
autumn, won’t it? I sometimes have dreams of our seeing
one another in autumn. If it is fine in autumn we are
thinking of staying in the country in October, too.

All the best,


Yours,


V. U.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
In Prosveshcheniye No. 11 (1913) there was a short article by
Mikhail Sadko on "Who Is Being Exiled?” There were no other
articles on the subject in the journal.

Berne

November 14, 1914 
 

Dear Anyuta,

I have received a letter from you and also from Mark,
and, lastly, a postcard from Mother. Many, many thanks to
everyone! I do not need any money at present. My
incarceration was a very brief
one,[1] only 12 days, and I was soon
granted certain privileges, so that the “time” I did was
very easy, the conditions and the treatment were good.
Now I have had time to look round and settle down here.
We are living in two furnished rooms, very good ones, and
we eat in a neighbouring dining-room. Nadya feels quite
well, so does Y.V., although she has aged badly. I have
finished my article for the Granat Encyclopaedia (about Marx)
and am sending it in a few
days.[2] I had to abandon part
(the bigger part, almost all) of my books in Galicia.... I
fear for their
safety.[3] It is very sad to watch the growth
of chauvinism in a number of countries and to see such
treacherous acts as those of the German (and not only the
German) Marxists, or pseudo-Marxists.... It stands to reason
that the liberals are praising Plekhanov again; he has fully
deserved that shameful
punishment.[4] Answer me as
quickly as possible about how matters stand with the jour-
nal.[5] Is there any possibility of starting it? If so, when?
Does the post office accept responsibility for manuscripts

    

sent by registered post? I embrace Mother fondly, send her
many kisses and hope she keeps well; regards to all from
all!

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

P.S. I have seen the disgraceful, shameless issue of 
Sovremenny
Mir....[6] Shame! Shame!

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
On August 7, 1914 Lenin’s apartment in Porpnin was searched
by the Austrian authorities on receipt of false information
accusing him of espionage. Lenin was ordered to report to the 
-6 gendarmerie in the district town of Novy Targ, where fie was arrested and 
 imprisoned next day.

Polish Social-Democrats and members of the Austrian 
-6 Parliament came to Lenin’s defence and he was released on August 19. 
 He obtained permission to leave Austria for neutral 
-7 Switzerland, arriving there on September 5, 1914.





[2]
This refers to Lenin’s article "Karl Marx (A Brief Biographical
Sketch with an Exposition of Marxism)”, written between July
and November 1914 for Granat’s Encyclopaedic Dictionary. An
abridged version of the article, signed V. Ilyin, was published
in 1915 in Volume 28 of the dictionary. It was first published in
full in 1925 in Marx, Engels, Marxism (see Collected Works,
Vol.
21, pp. 43–91). class="endnote">





[3]
Lenin s fears were fully justified. After he had left, the greater
part of his books and papers fell into the hands of the gendarme-

   

rie and were passed on to the General Staff in Warsaw. In 1954
some of this material was discovered in Poland and sent to the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the
C.P.S.U. and part of the documents hds been included in the
Collected Works.





[4]
During the First World War G. V. Plekhanov adopted a
socialchauvinist stand by defending the Menshevik tactics of defencism;
this met with favourable comments in the bourgeois press.





[5]
The journal referred to is Prosveshcheniye, publication of which
was to be resumed. In a letter to her sister Maria on April 11,
1915,
Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote that it was intended to 
 issue one or two
numbers of the journal in summer. In a letter dated 
 April 23, she wrote:
"We shall speak about restarting the journal,
or rather, of publishing a summer issue, so as not to lose the right 
 to
publish it, but so far we have not got down to it. Volodya
simply thirsts for a journal and a newspaper of our own."




[6]
In Sovremenny Mir No. 9 for 1914 there appeared an
ultra-chauvinist article by N. lordansky entitled "Let There Be Victory!".

December 22 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I was very glad to receive your letter of November 14
which arrived today. You addressed it to our old
apartment; our present address is Distelweg, 11.

I will try to find out whether or not there is a bureau
here that can give information about Russian prisoners
of war, and also about that particular prisoner you are
interested
in.[1] Perhaps because of the coming holidays
I shall not be able to find out immediately, but in any case
I will try.

We are living fairly well, quietly and peacefully in sleepy
Berne. The libraries here are good, and I have made quite
decent arrangements as far as the use of books is concerned.
It is even pleasant to read after my daily newspaper work.
There is a pedagogical library here for Nadya and she is
writing something on pedagogy.

I wrote asking Anyuta whether it is possible to find a
publisher for an agrarian book; I could write one here.
If you have an opportunity to do so, would you, too, try
to find out?
 

Why didn’t you write anything about yourself—how
are you keeping? Are you earning anything? How much,
where, and is it enough? Drop me a line if you can.

Very best regards,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

Nadya and Y.V. send best regards.

If you have an opportunity, please find out (if it is not
too much trouble) whether Granat received my article on
Marx. I would like to get some work for the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary, but it is probably not easy to arrange unless
you have an opportunity to meet the secretary of the
editorial board.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s sister Maria asked him to try to get information about
a prisoner of war, A. Rosenfeldt. In a letter to V. A. Karpinsky
in January 1915 Lenin asked whether there was a bureau in
Geneva giving information on  Russian prisoners of war in
Germany.

Dear Manyasha,

I have received two pamphlets from you—by Oganovsky
and Maslov. Many thanks! They are both rotten
opportunists of the most harmful type (can there be anybody in
agreement with them and with Plekhanov? It could not be
worse). It is, however, extremely useful to know what they
are writing. I shall therefore be extremely grateful if you
send me things of this sort and also clippings from
newspapers (and magazines) dealing with similar subjects. A
long time ago (in the August or September issues), Y.
Smirnov, for instance, wrote something extremely shallow in
Russkiye Vedomosti about voting for credits, etc. I saw that,
but I know nothing further about the literary activities
of this man and others like him.

Here we are well off for foreign newspapers and books
in the libraries. We are living fairly well. Berne is a small
and dull but quite civilised town. Y.V. is ill with
influenza.

There is a growth in the anti-chauvinist mood among
the Germans; there has been a split in Stuttgart and in
Frankfurt am
Main.[3] An anti-chauvinist publication

Lichtstrahlen[4] is appearing in Berlin.

If it will not be too much trouble, and if you should
happen to be somewhere near (please do not go there specially

    

as there is absolutely no hurry) please find out from the
Granats who accepted my article for the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary, whether they sent the fee to M.T. Yelizarov
(as I
asked),[1]

and whether it is possible to obtain some
more work there for the Encyclopaedic Dictionary. I have
written to the
secretary[2]

about this but he has not
answered me.

Wishing you all the best—regards from me and from
Nadya.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

October 7, 1915

Mother dearest,

Nadya and I moved a few days ago to Berne. We wanted
to stay longer in
Sörenberg,[2] but it was snowing there
and the cold was just impossible. This year autumn is very
cold, and Sörenberg has a mountain climate. We have
found a nice room here with electricity and bath for 30
francs. Nadya has put on quite a lot of weight; the
palpitation has gone; she has even been up the mountains—let’s
hope there is no recurrence of that thyroid trouble.

How are you all getting on? Have you made good
arrangements for the winter? Are you keeping well, and is the
apartment warm? We thank Anyuta very, very, very much
for the book, for the most interesting collection of
pedagogical publications and for the
letter.[1]

I wrote to her about
a publisher and am now awaiting an
answer.[3] How is
Manyasha? If you can, send her this letter; I should be
glad to get a line from her too. Give or send our best regards
to Mitya and Mark. I should be very grateful for a
subscription to Rech (Anyuta wrote that she intended
subscribing). There are not many newspapers, books or
pamphlets in Russian, we see very few and thirst for them. Has

    

Anyuta received my list of “the desirable” that I sent her
a long time ago? (i.e., desirable Russian books). I send
you many kisses and embrace you fondly. Anyuta, too.
So does Nadya.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 

[1]
Apparently a letter in invisible ink.—Ed.
 



[2]
Early in June 1915 Lenin and Krupskaya had left Berne for the
mountain village of Sorenberg, where they spent the summer.





[3]
The letter has been lost. Lenin was looking for a publisher for
his book New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of
Capitalism in Agriculture. Part One. Capitalism and Agriculture in
the United States of America, written in 1915 (see Collected Works,
Vol. 22, pp. 13–102). It was probably about this book that Anna
Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote to her sister Maria on February 27,
1915: "Thanks for trying to find someone for Volodya’s book—

   

because of this I shall postpone the conclusion of an agreement
with Bonch (he offers 50 rubles a signature for 3,000 copies).”

Lenin began his study of U.S. fanning statistics much earlier,
as can be seen from his letters to the New York economist I. A.
Hourwich on February 27 and to N. N. Nakoryakov on May 18,
1914.

When Lenin finished work on the book at the end of 1915 he
sent the MS to Gorky in Petrograd for the Parus Publishing House
(see Collected Works, Vol. 35, p. 212). It was eventually published
in pamphlet form in 1917 by the Zhizn i Znaniye Publishers.

Zürich I

February 20, 1916 
 

Dear Manyasha,

Many thanks for the newspapers you sent me a few days
ago. Today I received a notice from the Central Committee
of the German Red Cross Unions to the effect that Aaron
Rosenfeldt is a prisoner of war at Bütow, 66
Regiment.[1]
It has taken more than a year to get the information;
neither the Geneva nor the Danish Red Cross could find
anything out, but I accidentally came across the address of
the German prisoner of war commission and wrote to them.
They, too, took more than two months to reply!

Nadya and I are very pleased with Zurich; there are good
libraries here—we shall stay a few weeks more and then
return to
Berne.[2] You may write to this address, the post
office will forward the letters.

With all my very best wishes and Nadya’s too.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
It was later revealed that the information given concerned another
man of the same name, A. Rosenfeldt, in whom the Ulyanovs
were interested, had been killed at the front.





[2]
On February 21, 1916, Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote this
to her sister Maria: “I have had a letter from Nadya who writes
that their landlady drove them to desperation; they went all
over the place but could not find another room anywhere, then
hit upon the idea of going to Zurich for a couple of weeks to work
in the local libraries. She wrote about this trip and the little
shakeup as of something pleasurable.” Krupskaya’s letter has been
lost.

Mother dearest,

I am sending you some photos, one of them for Manyasha.

We are now living in Zurich. We came here to work in
the libraries. We like the lake here very much and the
libraries are much better than those in Berne, so we shall
probably stay here longer than we had intended. You may
write to this address, the post office always forwards
letters.

I hope that the cold weather is already past and that
you are not freezing in a cold apartment. I hope it will
soon be warm and you will recover from the winter.

Nadya sends her very best regards to all. Many kisses,
Mother dearest; keep well. Best regards to Anyuta and also
to M.T.

Yours,

V. U.

Dear M.T.,

Please show this postcard to Manyasha or send it on
to her. I yesterday received her letter (postcard) dated
August 8, and also some books, for which my best thanks.
I was greatly worried by the news that Anyuta is in hos-
pital.[1] What is the matter? Is it the same disease that made
her once before, as she wrote, go into hospital for an operation?
I hope that she and you will, at least, apply to only the very
best surgeons because in such cases one should never have
dealings with mediocre doctors. I shall impatiently await more
frequent news, even if only in brief. Letters take a terribly
long time nowadays! Many thanks to Manyasha for taking
so much trouble over publishers; I shall get down to writing
something or other, because prices have risen so hellishly
that life has become devilishly difficult. How is Manyasha
getting on? Does she earn a good salary? (I received 200
rubles and acknowledged it; thanks again.) If you can,
please send Russian newspapers once a week after you have
read them, because I have none at all (it is not worth while
sending them more often). All the best and kisses for
Manyasha. Nadya says the same.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

[1]
Lenin wrote about his sister Anna’s illness for reasons of secrecy;
actually she had been arrested on July 21, 1916. She was released
in October and banished to Astrakhan Gubernia; since she was
really ill, however, she was allowed to remain in Petrograd;
during the winter her house was twice searched but nothing was found.
In February 1917 she was again arrested although nothing was
found on this occasion either; a few days later she was released by
the revolutionary people.

October 22, 1916 
 

Dear Manyasha,

I received your two postcards dated August 29 and
September 1 at the same time. Thanks very much for the trouble
you have taken with the publishers and for the money you
sent. Has the new publisher received the manuscript on
modern
capitalism?[4] Please let me know when he does.
I regard this work on economics as being of exceptionally
great importance and would especially like to see it in print
in full. You write that the publisher wants to put out The
Agrarian Question as a book and not as a pamphlet. I
understand that to mean that I must send him the continuation
(i.e., in addition to what I have written about America I
must write what I have promised about
Germany).[5]
I will start on this as soon as I have finished what I
have to write to cover the advance received from the old

publisher.[1]


And so I take it that the new publisher has 
commissioned me to continue the agrarian question! If you have
the chance, remind him of that. (I have not received the
500 rubles, but shall receive them in a day or two, of course;
I do not think it is an advance, but payment for the
manuscripts received.)

Is it at all possible (if an opportunity offers, not especially)
to find out whether Granat included my article on Marx

    

in the
Dictionary?[2]

I did not get the promised reprints.
If he does not answer, can you find out from the library by
taking out the volume for that letter?

I have sent you three suggestions for translation (three
books—Kemmerer; Gilbreth; Hobson). If they are not
suitable let me know and I will look for others. If suitable,
you must make sure that an order is given and the suggestion
accepted. Then I will start work. Perhaps Anya will
undertake the translation of one of the books? Give Anya my very
best regards and Nadya’s. I have sent you three postcards
to
M.T.’s[3]

address and am now sending this to your
address. Is it just as convenient? Nadya and I are still living
in the same old way, quite quietly; the libraries in Zurich
are better and it is more convenient to work. Many kisses
from Nadya and me and regards to M. T. I am very grateful
for the books you sent; we have also received the women’s
journal.

Yours,

V. U.

The book referred to was Lenin’s Imperialism, the Highest Stage
of Capitalism which he wrote in the first half of 1916 and on July
2 sent via Paris to Parus Publishers in Petrograd; on Gorky’s
initiative this publishing house put out a series of popular booklets
on the countries of Western Europe during the First World War.
The series was edited by M. N. Pokrovsky, who was in Paris at
the time, and through him Lenin maintained contact with the
publishers The manuscript did not reach Pokrovsky and a second
copy had to be sent. In September 1916 Gorky wrote to Pokrovsky
saying, “Lenin is really magnificent”. The Parus editors, however,
protested strongly against Lenin’s criticism of Kautsky’s
apostasy and made some substantial changes to the text—they removed
the criticism of Kautsky’s theory of ultra-imperialism and
distorted several of Lenin’s formulations.


Lenin’s book was first published in Petrograd in mid-1917 under
the title Imperialism, the Latest Stage of Capitalism. (A Popular
Outline) with a Preface by Lenin dated April 26, 1917.





[5]
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism
in Agriculture. Part One. Capitalism and Agriculture in the United
States of America is the full title of the part published. Lenin
intended writing two further parts—on Germany and Austria—
and started collecting material. During a search of his house at
Poronin on August 7, 1914 three notebooks containing statistical
analyses on the agricultural systems of Germany, Austria and
Hungary were seized. The Central Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism, C.C., C.P.S.U., is in possession of some of the
material prepared by Lenin for the next part (on Germany).
Lenin was unable to carry out his intention of writing Part Two,
Germany.

Dear Manyasha,

I had just sent a registered postcard to Mark
Timofeyevich’s address when the books (a novel in two volumes) came
from you, and then a postcard saying you were expecting
Anyuta in a day or
two.[1]

Many thanks for the books. I am
very glad to get the news about Anyuta. My very best
regards to her; I hope she will not be long in Astrakhan
Gubernia and, while there, she should be careful not to get ill
from the hot climate to which she is not accustomed. Nadya
sends regards and thanks you for the news about Lidiya.

There have been no changes here. Prices are rising more
than ever. Many thanks for the money (I have written to
M.T. acknowledging receipt of 500 rubles=869 francs). If
it is not too much trouble send me three or four times a
month the Russian newspapers after you have read them—
tie them up tightly with string or they will get lost. I have
no Russian newspapers here. For translation I proposed

    

three books—Kemmerer, Technischer Fortschritt, Hobson,
Imperialism, and Gilbreth, Motion Study. I have not yet
received an answer and am awaiting one (because the
publisher must find out whether they have been published
before).

I again wish everybody all the best and send you and
Anya many kisses.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Dear Manyasha,

I today received 808 francs through the Azov-Don Bank;
in addition to that I received 500 francs on January 22.
Please write and let me know what money this is, whether
it is from a publisher, from which one, for what and whether
it is for me. I must keep an account, that is, I must know
what the publisher has paid for and what he has not. I
cannot understand where so much money comes from;
Nadya says jokingly that I must have been “pensioned
off”. Ha, ha! The joke is a merry one, for the cost of living
makes one despair and I have desperately little capacity
for work because of my shattered nerves. But joking aside,
I must know more about this; please let me know. It is most
likely that one (or more) of your letters has gone astray
and I do not know what is going on. I am afraid to spend
the money (sometimes money was sent through me to a
sick friend).

I recently received these books from you: Russkiye
Zapiski, Tvyordiye tseny na khleb, Trudovoye posrednichestvo,
Tulskaya statistika. I am very, very grateful.

Very best regards to Anyuta, M.T. and Mitya. There
are no changes here, we live very quietly; Nadya often

    

feels poorly. The winter has been exceptionally cold, even
now it is still cold. How are all of you there? Are you
keeping well? We rarely get news of you.

All the best, many kisses,


Yours,

Dear Mark Timofeyevich,

From the enclosed you will see that Nadya is planning
the publication of a Pedagogical Dictionary or  Pedagogical
Encyclopaedia.[2]

I am strongly in favour of this plan because, in my
opinion, it fills a very serious gap in Russian pedagogical
literature; it will be a very useful work and will provide an
income, which for us is extremely important.

With the increase in the number of readers and the
broader circles involved, there is now a quickly growing demand
for encyclopaedias and similar publications. A properly
compiled Pedagogical Dictionary or Pedagogical
Encyclopaedia will become a handbook and go through a number
of editions.

I am sure Nadya can do this because she has been working
in pedagogy for years, has written about it and has
undergone systematic training. Zurich is an exceptionally
convenient centre for work of this kind; it has the world’s
finest pedagogical museum.

There is no doubt that such an undertaking would be
profitable. The best thing would be for us to undertake

    

the publication of it ourselves, borrowing the necessary
capital or finding a capitalist who would come in as a
partner in the enterprise.

If that is not possible, and if it would be merely a waste
of time to go chasing after it—you, of course, will know
what is best, and when you have given it some thought
and obtained some information, decide the matter for
yourself—the plan should be offered to the old publisher, who
will probably accept it. The plan must not be stolen, i.e.,
somebody else must not get in first. Then a detailed contract
must be concluded with the publisher in the name of the
editor (Nadya) that covers all the terms. If not, the
publisher (the old publisher too!) will grab all the profit for
himself and enslave the editor. That happens.

I should very much like you to give this plan your best
attention, take a look round, talk with people, worry them,
and
answer[1]

me in detail.

All the best,


Yours,


V. Ulyanov

P.S. The publication is in two volumes, two columns
to a page; to be issued in parts of 16 to 32 pages. Advertise
for subscribers. Then the money will come in quickly.

If you are successful send a telegram “Encyclopaedia contract
concluded” and Nadya will speed up the work.—Lenin

Dear Manyasha,

I am sending you greetings and all best wishes. I am quite
comfortable and am working on the question of the state,
which has interested me for a long
time.[1]! want to give
you some advice—you absolutely must go away for medical
treatment. There is nothing much doing at the present
time, troubled though it is, and you must use it to get your
leg and your nerves treated. I ask you very, very sincerely
to go away—immediately and without fail. You can take
a translation or some fiction with you, so that you will be
better able to stand the boredom that to a certain extent
is inevitable during medical treatment. But you absolutely
must go. Please do as I ask and drop me a line in reply. I
embrace you fondly.

Yours,

Ulyanov

Dear, sweet
Mimosa,[1]


I ask you very much to go away for treatment, do not
postpone it. You must not miss the chance. When you
return it will be easy to arrange a job for you. You
absolutely must go.

The Beer plan is an excellent one. Try also
to get Schlüter on Chartism (in
German);[3] it appeared after Beer
and corrected that opportunist. A very good booklet could
be written about Beer and Schlüter. Drop me a line in reply.

“Party Congresses” is also a good subject (in addition
to the minutes, various
booklets[2]

are needed, I do not
even approximately remember which ones). If you do write,
send me the draft and we can discuss it.

I embrace you very fondly.

V. Ul.

Notes
 
 



[1]
At this time Krupskaya was on board the government propaganda
vessel Krasnaya Zvezda as representative of the People’s
Commissariat of Education. Propagandists and representatives of a
number of People’s Commissariats were on board the vessel which
sailed from Nizhny Novgorod to Perm, stopping at towns and
villages, factories and factory settlements. Krupskaya kept a
detailed diary of the voyage.

The telegram from V. M. Pozner which Lenin mentions ran as
follows: “The Provisional Executive Committee of the Union of
Workers in Education and Socialist Culture has to inform you
that the Second All-Russia Communist Conference opens on July
25, two days prior to the opening of the congress appointed for
July 27 by a decision of the second session. The Executive
Committee requests you to speak on ’The New Personnel in
Education and Work Among the People’. Please inform us of your
consent.”

July 9, 1919 
 

Nadya dearest,

I was very glad to hear from you. I sent a telegram to
Kazan and, as I got no answer, sent another to Nizhny,
and from there I today received a reply to the effect that
the Krasnaya Zvezda is supposed to arrive in Kazan on
July 8 and stay there for not less than 24 hours. In that
telegram I asked whether it would be possible to give Gorky
a cabin on Krasnaya Zvezda. He is arriving here tomorrow
and I want very much to drag him out of Petrograd, where
he has exhausted his nerves and gone sour. I hope you and
the other comrades will be glad to have Gorky travelling
with you. He is really a very nice chap, a bit capricious,
but that is nothing.

I read the letters asking for help that sometimes come
for you and try to do what I can.




Mitya has left for Kiev; the Crimea, it seems, is again
in the hands of the Whites.

There is nothing new here; on Sundays we take a holiday
at “our” country
house.[3] Trotsky is better; he has left
for the South and I hope he will manage all right. I am
expecting an improvement from the substitution of Kamenev
(from the Eastern Front) for Vatsetis.

We are giving Pokrovsky
(M.N.)[1]

two months’ leave

    

for a rest; we want to appoint Lyudmila Rudolfovna
Menzhinskaya as deputy commissar in his place (although it
is not yet definite), but not Pozner.

I embrace you fondly and ask you to write and to telegraph
more often.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

N.B. Obey the doctor’s advice: eat and sleep more, then
you will be fully fit for work by winter.

 
Notes
 

[1]
M. N. Pokrovsky was at that time Deputy People’s Commissar
of Education of the R.S.F.S.R.—Ed.
 



[2]
Krupskaya has the following to say about her correspondence
with Lenin: “The letter of July 9, 1919 is the only private letter
from Vladimir Ilyich that I still have. We did not live much apart.
We carried on a considerable correspondence when Ilyich was in
prison and during his first year of exile, when he was alone, also
during my stay, in Ufa. In those days we wrote mostly in
invisible ink and letters were destroyed as soon as they had been read.

   

In 1919 I travelled on the propaganda vessel Krasnaya Zvezda
for about two months. It was difficult to correspond in this period
because of the constant movement of the vessel. But even those
few letters I received from Ilyich were all, except one, destroyed,
following the habit of underground work acquired in the past.”
Another letter and a telegram sent by Lenin to the propaganda
ship were discovered later (see Letter No. 270 and Telegram No.
269).





[3]
Lenin here refers to Gorki, near Moscow, where he spent any
leisure time he had. Lenin first went there on September 24 or
25, 1918. At first he spent his days off there but later, on the
insistence of his doctors, he lived there for some time, although
even during this period of rest he continued working hard.

Towards the end of 1921 Lenin’s health deteriorated seriously.
On December 6 he was granted leave of absence and spent the
time in Gorki. During his illness (May 23-October 2, 1922) he lived
in Gorki and went there on a visit for a few days in early
December. From May 15, 1923 to his death on January 21, 1924, Lenin
lived in Gorki, leaving there only on rare occasions.

The place is now called Gorki Leninskiye and a Lenin Museum
was opened there on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death.

We are all
well.[1] I saw Gorky today and tried to
persuade him to travel on your steamer, about which I sent
a telegram to Nizhny, but he flatly refused. We are giving
Pokrovsky leave of absence. Menzhinskaya has been
provisionally appointed in his place. I received your letter
from Uretsky and sent a reply back by him. Do you get

Nadezhda Konstantinovna Ulyanova,


Government vessel Krasnaya Zvezda

July 15 
 

Nadya dearest,

I am taking advantage of Krestinsky’s visit to Perm to
write to you. Maybe he will catch up with you.

Yesterday I received a telegram from Molotov in Kazan
and answered him in time for you to get it before the vessel
leaves Kazan, which should be, I am told, at 3 a.m.

I learned from Molotov that you did have a heart attack;
that means that you are overworking yourself. You must
stick strictly to the rules and obey the doctor’s orders
absolutely.

Otherwise you will not be able to work when winter
comes. Don’t forget that!

I have already wired you about affairs in the People’s
Commissariat of Education.

Things are going brilliantly on the Eastern Fronts. Today
I learned of the capture of Yekaterinburg. In the south
there has been a change, but there is still no serious turn
for the better. I hope there will be.

I could not persuade Gorky to go, hard as I tried.

Yesterday and the day before I was in Gorki with Mitya
(he has been here for four days) and Anya. The limes are
in bloom. We had a good rest.

I embrace you fondly and kiss you. Please rest more
and work less.

Yours,

V. Ulyanov

Dear Anyuta,

This is what happened. The book, it seems, is from the
Socialist Academy, and it is forbidden to take books home
from there.

They made an exception for me!

It created an awkward situation—my fault, of course.
Now you must take the greatest care that Gora reads the
book quickly at home and returns it.

If necessary I can arrange for it to be sought in another
place—so that the book will become my property.

Yours,

V. U.

## I. Entries Concerning Letters from Lenin to His Relatives (From the Files of the Moscow Gendarmerie)










V. I. Lenin
Entries Concerning Letters From Lenin To
His Relatives 


Published: Volume 37 by the Editors
Source: Lenin Collected Works, Progress Publishers, 1977, Moscow, Volume 37, pages 553-554. Translated/Edited: George H. Hanna and Robert Daglish.

(From the Files of the Moscow Gendarmerie)
During a search of the house of Lenin’s sister Maria Ulyanova on the night of February 28, 1901, six letters from Lenin were seized and placed in her dossier as “material evidence”. The flies of the Moscow Gendarmerie (Dossier of the Moscow Group of the R.S.D.L.P., No. 69, Volume V, 1901, sheet 101 (The dossier is now in the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism—Leninism, CC., C.P.S.U.—Editor) contain the following entries concerning these letters.
1. A letter dated July 3, 1897, signed “Yours, V. U.” and beginning with the words “I have received your letter of June 10, dear Manyasha”, was found in an envelope addressed to Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (the mother of “Manyasha”). The letter contains a programme of Marxist studies, and among the source material mentioned are such Social—Democratic periodicals as Vorwärts and Neue Zeit. 
2. A letter dated September 4, 1898, is signed “Yours, V. U.” but on the envelope the address of the sender is given as Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova. In this letter, which begins with the words “A few days ago, Mother dearest, I received your letter”, the following phrases are outstanding: (1) “As for sending books to Sergei Ivanovich, I must say that I do not know where he is. Perhaps lie is already in Srednc—Kolymsk”; (2) “Lyakhovsky wrote a few days ago—mostly about new exiles passing through Verkholensk”; (3) “Vas. Vas. (Starkey) is thinking of asking to be sent to Nizhneudinsk”; (4) “The Lepeshinskys are being moved to Kuraginskoye”; (5) “Apollinariya Alexandrovna wrote recently from Kazachinskoye”.
3. A letter signed “V. U.”, dated December 15, 1898, beginning with the words “I am sending Anyuta Y.M. ’s letter which he sent me with a request that I despatch it immediately”, in which the phrase quoted, and the initials “Y M.” in that phrase, are deserving of attention
4. A letter dated June 14, 1899, signed “Yours, V. U.”, begins with the words “This week there has been no news from home, Mother dearest”; the name of Prince Yegor Yegorovich Kugushev is mentioned in the letter; the author of the letter asks for a copy of his book on the development of capitalism to be sent to the aforementioned Kugushev
5. A letter by the same author dated “August 18, 1900, Paris”, addressed to M. A. Ulyanova; it contains the address: “M. Dr. Dubon, chat… Pour M Goukowsky, 8 Boulevard Capucines, Paris”.
6. A letter dated “October 20, Prague”, signed “V. U.”, addressed to Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova; it contains the address: “Herrn Franz ModraÃÂ«ek (for VI.), Smeiky, 27 Prag. Austria.”
Attempts to find these letters have not so far met with any success; it is possible that they were destroyed in one of the fires that occurred in the early days of the February Revolution.

February 15, 1898
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Did not Anna Ilyinichna receive the letter I sent on February 8 or 9? I wrote in some detail about myself in that letter. The trouble is that I still do not know when the sentence will be pronounced; at the Ministry of Justice they told me that the case would be reported on in either the first or the second week of Lent. They also said that I have been sentenced to three years in Ufa Gubernia (the sentence is not to be changed), but that the Department can, on its own author ity, permit me to spend the time I am under surveillance in Shu shenskoye. The situation is thoroughly vague. After the sentence has been pronounced I shall probably have to remain in St. Petersburg a couple of weeks, so we may expect to leave during the third or fourth week of Lent. We shall stay in Moscow for two or three days and I shall write and let you know the day of arrival as soon as I know it for certain. As far as Volodya’s work [The work referred to is Lenin’s Economic Studies and Essays.—Editor.] is concerned, I have been definitely  promised that a publisher will be found; they say that censorship conditions in Moscow are very bad and that there is a risk of the book lying at the censor’s for a long time; I have been advised to publish the book in summer, so that it appears in autumn, the most suitable time for the publication of a book of this type. Because of all this, I did not take the manuscript back but asked Anna Ilyinichna what she thought would be the best thing to do—I have not received an answer. In the meantime I have sent Volodya a translation from English (the editor says that it does not matter even if Volodya does not know English very well, he can translate from the German version and use the English only to check with); it is a very interesting translation and the pay is good. I do not know whether Volodya intended taking translations although I gathered from one of his letters that he did; in any case, there is nothing to worry about because I have been told that we may both translate, the book is a big one. Jam terribly ignorant on the administrative side of literary work.
Mother has been buffering from pleurisy and has not been out for about a month; today a new doctor is coming to examine her—the one who treated her before was very casual. Mother sends her very best regards to all.
Still, I think I shall be allowed to go to Shusha—what do they care?
Many kisses,
Your loving,

Nadya
*  *  *  *
Deal Manyasha
I have written once to Anna Ilyinichna but she evidently has not received my letter. Bulochka, too is scolding me for not writing and also without any reason! Of course, there is nothing to write about, nothing is definite, one thing today, another tomorrow, but I do write about essential things and I answer letters.
I have not seen Jcluba and probably shall not see her before I leave. I had a letter from her saying that now she does not have to talk she feels wonderful. She studies a lot, is very glad about the Thursdays and sends regards to all.
I shall probably get V.V. I have given Volodya’s list to an acquaintance, who has promised to get everything except Lyudogovsky (it has long been out of print) and the journal on economics. I do not know whether he will get them although he is an expert at obtaining books. I want to get in a good stock of books but I do not know what to take. I have few books of my own and they are very ordinary, so I don’t really know whether it is worth taking them—Volodya probably has them all anyway. It is not very easy to get books from acquaintances—and what should one get? In a couple of weeks I have to go and my stock of hooks is still pitifully small. In general we are being rather slack and quite unmethodical about preparing for the journey. People say we ought to take as many warm things as possible … It probably will not be long now before we start. Kiss A.I. and tell her it is not nice of her to give such accounts of me everywhere—to Volodya she wrote about my looking like a herring, to Bulochka she complained of my slyness … Many kisses for you, dear. Thank Dmitry Ilyich for his congratulations. I hope his case is over by the summer. An revolt!

March 6
I am sending Volodya’s articles. I did not send them before because I was waiting for him to reply to the letter in which I wrote about censorship conditions. He asked me to make enquiries, and the result of my enquiries is that the place of publication is most important. In this respect, Moscow is worse than St. Petersburg because even the most innocent books are held up for a long time and then hacked about very badly. Bulgakov’s book was held up for a year by the censor. It appears that Vodovozova has also transferred her publishing house to St. Petersburg. The ecri vain insists that it would be extremely unwise to publish the book in Moscow. So that’s that.
About my departure … Manya dear, I know nothing at all. There is a lady from Minusinsk living here who says that I shall not be able to leave after the lath or 12th without the risk of getting stuck on the way. I was hoping all along that the sentence would be pronounced on March 4 and we would be able to leave on the evening of the 10th. The sentence, however, has been postponed until the 11th (not definite either) and this is what they say in the Department: my request will “probably be taken into consideration”, and if I am given permission to go to Siberia, it will not be before the sentence has been pronounced, and perhaps I shall be given permission to go straight from St. Petersburg and not from Ufa Gubernia (I). I am going to the Department again tomorrow. I certainly don’t want my journey to be postponed until spring. I am in a great hurry today but tomorrow evening I will write to Anna llyinichna and tell her about my trip to the Department. Tomorrow, while I am there, J shall ask to be allowed to see Kuhn—it would be such a pity to go away without having seen her once.
Many kisses,
N. Krupskaya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
We have now reached Shushenskoye and I am keeping my promise to write and tell you how Volodya is looking. It seems to me he is a picture of health and looks very much better than he did in St. Petersburg. One of the local inhabitants, a Polish woman,[The wife of I. L. Prominsky.—Editor] says, “Pan Ulyanov, is always in a good mood”. He is terribly taken up with the shooting, in fact they are all such enthusiastic sportsmen that I, too, will probably soon be on the constant look—out for duck, teal and other such creatures.
The journey to Shusha is not at all tiring, especially if there is no need to wait in Krasnoyarsk; it is even promised that in June the steamers will go right up to Shusha. That will make everything just right. So if you can manage a trip the journey will not be too bad. It seems to me that Shusha is very nice, the forest and river are near. I am not writing a lot because this is only a postscript to Volodya’s letter.[See Letter No. 47.—Editor] He has probably written in much greater detail. In Minusinsk I went to enquire about the books; a letter from you and a notice about the receipt of a parcel had come, but the addressee cannot get them from Krasnoyarsk; things were set right that same evening and we sent a power of attorney to Krasnoyarsk and the books will be here in a day or two. Many thanks. Things turned out quite all right with our innumerable bags and baggage, nothing was lost and people made room for us everywhere. Thanks, too, for the food. It lasted us for three days and it was much nicer than railway—station meals … So here we are. They did put us ashore after all. Volodya is not satisfied with what I had to tell him about all of you. He says it is very little, but I told him all I knew. Kisses for all of you, regards to MT. and D. 1.

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Volodya is sitting here engaged in an earnest conversation with a miller about some houses and cows and things, so I am taking the opportunity of writing you a few lines. I do not know where to begin, one day is the same as another and there is nothing happening outside the family. I seem to have been living an age in Shusha and have become completely acclimatised. Shusha is a very nice place in summer. We go walking every evening. Mother does not go very far, but we sometimes set off for more distant places. In the evenings ther is no humidity in the air and it’s just right for walking. There are a lot of mosquitoes and we have made nets for ourselves but they seem to go out of their way to bite Volodyn, although in general they are quite bearable. The famous “gun dog” accompanies us on our walks and spends all its time chasing birds, which always makes Volodya indignant. At this time of the year Volodya does not go shooting (he is not really such an enthusiastic sportsman), it . is nesting time or something, and even his waders have been put away in the cellar. Instead of shooting Volodya tried his hand at fishing. A few times he crossed the Yenisei to fish for burbot at night but the last time he came back without so much as a tiddier, and since then there has been no more talk of burbot. Across the Yenisel it is just marvellous. We once went across there and had heaps of adventures of all kinds and everything was tine. It is hot nowadays. We have to walk quite a long way to bathe. A plan for morning swimming has been elaborated for which we are to get up at 6 am, I do not know how long this will last, but today we went swimming. Altogether our life here follows the “standard” summer—cottage routine, only we have nothing for the house.
They feed us well here, we have all the milk we like and we are all flourishing. I have not yet got used to Volodya’s healthy appearance, in St. Petersburg I was accustomed to seeing him in a permanently out—of—sorts condition. Zinochka even gasped when she saw him in Minusinsk. And you should see what she looks like—thank God. With Lirochka it’s a different story. We were sent a photograph from St. Petersburg; it was taken the day after she was released and she looks simply terrible. Can she have changed so much? Sometimes I think they might send her to Shusha. That would be fine. In Shusha she might recover a little.
Well, I have given you a whole heap of gossip. In her last letter Manyasha asked about photographs. On the way here I wrote to St. Petersburg and asked them to send you my photograph (home production) but they must have forgotten. As regards photographs that are not home–made, I shall write to St. Petersburg.and ask them to go to the photographer’s and order a few more pictures of me, and that they certainly will not refuse to do. I should very much like you and Manya to come to visit us here. There is still time for it. Give DI. my regards. Volodya has finished talking to the miller and has already written two letters and I still cannot wind up my gossip.
Good–bye for now and many kisses. Mother sends regards to all. It is useless sending regards through Volodya, he thinks they should be taken for granted. Nevertheless I send many kisses to Maaya and Anyuta and regards to M.T.

August 9, 1898
It gave Volodya great satisfaction to read out to me all the reproaches that you have written about me. Well, I admit that I am guilty but deserving of leniency.
Today Volodya finished his markets”,[Lenin’s book The Development of Capitalism in Russia—Editor] now he has only to cut it down and the job is done. In a few days, too, Webb will come safely to an end. Less than a half is left to be checked. I think the translation turned out all right in the cud.
Another box of books for Volodya—among them Adam Smith, philosophy and two books of yours by Ado Negri—has arrived addressed to Madame Friedmann She looked like raising a real storm but the outcome is that the books have been received, put on the shelves and catalogued. Volodya from time to time looks lovingly at the philosophy and dreams of the time when he will be able to wallow in it.
I received a letter from Lirochka yesterday, such a cheerful one, describing her life at Kazachinskoye. There are ten exiles there, most of whom live in a commune; they have their own vegetable garden, a cow and a meadow and live in one big house. Lii’a says she enjoys her freedom, goes picking berries and haymaking, does some housekeeping and never looks at a book. She proposes spending the summer in this way and then leaving the commune in autumn and settling down to work. It was a long and lively letter and I am very glad for her sake, she is at least getting a rest.
Life here goes on as usual and there is no news of any kind. Voiodya has been busy all the time, although occasionally he has been snipe shooting. They had intended going somewhere after snipe today but the wind has been howling mercilessly for several days, day and night. There is no rain but just this raging wind.
We are [eating] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . bottling rasp[berries]…[The dotted line indicates part of the letter cut out together with names on the other side of the page. The last syllable of the verb in the Russian has been cut away, so the sense might have been “we are [going] …,”—Editor] in spirit, salting cucumbers—everything is as it should be, just as in Russia. We once bought some water melons but, as was to be expected, theyi turned out absolutely white without the faintest suggestion of red flesh. We have also tried cedar nuts. Volodya is thinking of going into the taiga for a couple of days; he wants to see what the taiga is like, gather berries and cones and shoot hazel grouse. There has been a lot of talk about the taiga, and it is much more interesting than the talk about ducks.
That, I think, is all there is to tell about us.
When is Manya leaving for Brussels? I am glad for her sake. I have written a letter to [Anna Ivanovna Meshcheryakova (the former [Chechurina l]),[The names in square brackets were cut out for secrecy.—Editor] our schoolteacher and my very good friend. She will be living in Lidge—the only thing I am afraid of is that she has left already and my letter will be too late.
And so good—bye; many kisses for you, Manya and Maria Alexandrovna. Regards to MT. Mother sends regards to all—she has been feeling poorly lately. All the best.
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
A telegram about the release of D.I. eventually arrived with the last post. The post came when our place was full of visitors. During the past few days we have been subjected to an invasion of “aliens”, some from Minusinsk, some from places round about—people of very different character. They brought discord into our peaceful life and towards the end we were growing a little bit crazy The various “farm” discussions about horses, cows, pigs, etc., really wore us out. Everyone here is interested in farm life—even we acquired half a horse (one of the local residents hired a horse from the volost and we wanted to buy the fodder for it so as to be able to use it as much as we wanted), but our half horse turned out to be such a worn—out nag that it took an hour and a half to drag us three versts and we had to give it back; and so our efforts in this field turned out a fiasco. We do, however, gather mushrooms with great zeal, there are lots of saffron milk—cap and milk agaric mushrooms here At first Volodya announced that he did not know how to gather mushrooms and did not like it, but now you cannot drag him out of the forest, he gets real “mushrooth fever”. Next year we intend to have a vegetable garden and Volodya has already agreed to dig the seedbeds. That will be physical exercise for him. Up to now he has been enthusiastic only about his shooting. Right now he is arming himself for the hunt. He shoots grey—hen and we eat them and praise them I do not think our “manor house” will be very cold. A clerk lived here before us and said it was all right, warm. In any case we are taking all the necessary precautions—we have ordered some felt, we are sealing the windows up carefully, are piling up earth round the bottom of the house, etc. We have a stove in every room, so we do not expect it to be very cold. Well, that’s enough gossip. I embrace you fondly, I am awfully glad for DI. ’s sake and for yours. Give him my very best regards. Many kisses for Anya and Manya. Mother sends best regards to all. She is gradually being drawn into Shushenskoye life and is not so bored now as she was at first.

Yours,
Nadya

September 11 1898
Today I am going to write an enormously long letter; Volodya has gone off to Krasnoyarsk and the place seems empty without him, the “regime” has changed. As there is suddenly nothing to do this evening the best thing is to scribble a letter. I can run on about this and that for any length of time, but that is all it will be—just “this and that’.
Today, dear Manya, 1 got your long, long letter, and Volodya received a postcard from Tula, I suppose from 0.1. I have put it in his desk. I imagine it must be boring for 0.1. to hang about in Tula and, in general, his present state of uncertainty is not of the pleasantest and in a strange town it is particularly miserable; but the worst is over, that endless “sit—down at Azov”.[Don and Zaporozhye Cossacks were besieged in the fort of Azov in l641 they “sat” in the fort for over a year before abandoning it to the Turks—Editor] By now D.I. may perhaps be in Podoisk … in any case the question has probably been settled.
We are having a marvellous autumn, except that in the early morning it is cold and at night there are frosts. Because of this Volodyn has taken all his warm things with him—a warm cap, winter coat, mittens and warm socks. He put in a request about his teeth a long time ago; now his toothache has gone and permission has come for him to spend a week in Krasnoyarsk. At first Velodya thought he would not go, but then he yielded to temptation. I am very glad that he will be making this trip, it will liven him up and be will be seeing people—he was vegetating here in Shusha. He was also glad to be going. The day before he left not a single book was opened. I spent all my time repairing his winter equipment while lie sat on the windowsill talking excitedly and giving me all sorts of advice—to have the double windows put in properly, to keep the door well locked (he even borrowed a saw from our landlord and set about sawing a piece off the door to make it fasten more easily. In general, he has been worrying a lot about our safety—he has persuaded Oscar to come to us to sleep and he has been teaching me how to use a revolver. He slept badly that night but when I woke him up in the morning—that was when the coachman was already here—he was so cheerful he began singing a song of triumph. I do not know whether he will be pleased with the trip. He couldn’t resist taking a mountain of books with him—five of the fattest tomes—and intends to make notes in the Krasnoyarsk library in addition to that. I hope the books will remain unread. When in Krasnoyarsk Volodya is under an obligation to buy for himself two caps, linen for his shirts, a sheepskin greatcoat for family use, skates, etc. I wanted to order him to buy material for a blouse for Promiosky’s daughter but since Volodya went to Mother to find out how many “pounds” of cloth to buy for a blouse he had to be relieved of that onerous duty. I have received a short note from Volodys sent from Miausinsk; although he grumbles at having to wait for a steamer I gathered that the journey is beginning satisfactorily. 
During Volodya’s absence I intend: (1) to carry out full repairs to his suits; (2) learn to pronounce English for which I have to learn by heart 12 pages of various exceptions in Nurok’s book; (3) finish reading an English book I have started. And then do some general reading. Volodya and I began to read The Agitator (“For Nadyn” is written on The Agitator in Anya’s hand and I keep intending to thank her for it, but so far have done nothing but intend) and we have been tormented by English pronunciation so now I have promised him to learn Nurok by heart. These days I am doing the cooking. Mother has an awful cold in the head which has developed into a severe chill, so I am running the show. Mother has become quite used to Shushenskoye and in her letters describes the wonderful Shushenskoye autumn. Before Voledya left we all went with him on a shoot for grey–hen. The season is now open for grey–hen and partridge They are noble birds—you don’t have to crawl in swamps for them like you do for ducks and things. But no matter how many times we went out we never saw either a grey—hen or a partridge, but still the walks were fine. By the way, we once saw about twenty partridge; we were riding on a cart, all the Shushenskoye colony, when suddenly a whole flock of them rose from both sides of the road; you can imagine what our sportsmen were like. Volodya actually groaned. Still, he managed to take aim, but the partridge simply walked away without even bothering to fly. Altogether that was a sorrowful shoot; we didn’t kill anything, though Oscar shot Jenny in the eyes and we thought the dog would be blinded, but she recovered. Jenny is awfully miserable without Volodya, she keeps close to me all the time and barks for no good reason.
You see what nonsense I am writing because there is nothing happening outside the family. That is why Volodya writes about one and the same thing in his letters—when things outside are so monotonous one completely loses one’s sense of time. Volodya and I once got to the state when we could net rsmethber whether V.V. had visited us three days or ten days before. We had to adduce a whole series of arguments to settle the issue. We only just managed it. Volodya intended writing home from Minusinsk, so some parts of my letter will probably be repeated. Perhaps not, though. Mine is a purely feminine letter, net much in it. I recently received a letter from the writer’s wife, who writes that she is reading the proofs of Volodya’s book,[N. A. Strnve read the first part of the proofs of the symposium Economic Studies and Essays—Editor] she had the seventh signature at the time. She was afraid there would not be ten signatures in the book—there is a new law about the number of letters to a signature If not, Karyshev[Lenin’s article was entitled “On the Question of our Factory Statistics (Professor Karysliev’s New Statistical Exploits),” Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 13-45.—Editor] can be shoved in, too; it would be a good idles, except that the book will be held up. We are expecting it any day. Volodya hopes to finish the “markets” by the New Year, but he is rather doubtful about it. And that’s that. I have received Maria Alexandrovna’s letter of August tO and for some reason was particularly glad to have it. Many kisses for her.
By the time you receive my letter you will probably be getting ready to leave. I wish you every success. There was a time when I very much wanted to go to Belgium. Perhaps I shall feel like going abroad again, just to take a look at the wide world—when that is possible. But for the time being it is not to be thought of. I suppose you will wait for Anya, won’t you? When did she expect to get back? [Meshcheryakova][The name was cut out for purposes of secrecy.—Editor] is a very fine person, a bit wild, but amazingly forthright and good. It is time to stop. Again, many kisses for you and Maria Alexandrovna from me and Mother.
Yours, N.

September 27
Today I am again writing instead of Volodya, dear Maria Alexandrovna. Volodya returned from Krasnoyarsk late in the evening the day before yesterday; two of Manya’s letters were awaiting him and he intended to sit down and write a letter home, but first thing in the morning Oscar and Promiasky came to entice him away shooting at a place called Aganitov Island where, according to them, hares run around in thousands and flocks of grey-hen and partridge fill the air. Volodya began by hesitating but in the end yielded to temptation; by the way, it is a wonderful day today. In general this autumn has been a good one except for a week or so when it was cold. Altogether, Volodya was pleased with his trip to Krasnoyarsk. He has probably written that he went to Krasnoyarsk with Elvirn Ernestovua and Tonechka because E.E. had injured her liver and was quite ill [See Lenin’s Letter No 55—Editor]. We thought she had cancer or an abscess of the liver but fortunately it was neither, only a blow. And all she has to do is look after herself They came back with Volodya. Eli. was in hospital in Krasnoyarsk and Volodya lived at Krasikov ’s. He saw lots of people in Krasnoyarsk, had plenty of talks and played about ten games of chess. One of the people now living temporarily in Krasnoyarsk is very likely to be sent to the village of Yermakovskoye, about 40 versts from us. He is a chess player and a very interesting conversationalist—Volodya made his acquaintance in Krasnoyarsk. I should very much like him to be sent there. We could visit each other, 40 versts is no ?eat distance Volodya travelled as far as Minusinsk (the steamer took Eve days to crawl there) with Lopeshinskaya, the wife of an exile who lives in Kazachinskoye. She has been given a job as nurse in the village of Karaginskoye, also not far from here, and her husband is joining her. He is a chess player, too. Lepeshinskaya told Volodya that Lirochka is in a state of nerves and irritable, lives in the commune and does the cooking every other week. They have three women there, one of them bakes bread and the others take turns at cooking. The day before yesterday I had a letter from Lirochka and she seems to be thoroughly fed up with the life of the colony; she writes that she is glad when she is alone and can do something. It turned out that the tooth of Volodyas that ached was not the one he had been trying to pull out but another, and this the Krasnoyarsk dentist duly pulled Volodya found the way back home deadly boring although he had mustered quite a pile of books in addition to the masses he took from home. He did not want to step in Minusinsk and did not even hand his travel permit in to the chief of police. In Krasnoyarsk lie bought a long sheepskin coat. It is intended actually for me but in reality it will be a family coat for travelling and distant excursions, it cost twenty rubies and is so delightfully soft that once you are inside it you don’t want to get out of it again. In general he bought everything he was supposed to, even toys for Prominsky’s children and for Minva, the son of the felt-boot maker who lives next door. The lad is about five years old and often trots in to see us. The morning he heard that Volodya was back, he snatched hold of his mother’s boots and began pulling them on. “Where are you off to?” “Don’t you know Vladimir Ilyich has come back?” You’ll get in his way, don’t go ”Oh no, Vladimir Ilyich likes me!” (Volodya really is fond of him.) Yesterday, when we gave him the horse Volodya had brought from Krasnoyarsk for him, he was so taken with Volodya that he would not even go home to sleep but lay down on the mat with Jenny. An amusing lad!
At last we have engaged a servant, a fifteen-year-old girl, for two and a half rubles a month boots; she is coming on Tuesday and that will be the end of our independent housekeeping. We have got in supplies of everything we can for winter. We still have to put the double windows in, although it is a pity to seal ourselves in when it is so fine outside! Mother is gradually being drawn into Shusheuskoye affairs, she keeps well and is not bored. Thank Manyasha for the letter; of course I shall write to her abroad, too. I wonder how she will get fixed up there. It is a pity it is inconvenient for her to travel with the Meshcieryakovs, they are excellent people, Anna especially. We have received the German Zola and are going to start reading it. We shall now be receiving Frankfurter Zeitung. It will be seat from St. Petersburg and Volodya intends subscribing to some English newspaper. Why is there not a sound about Volodya’s book? It will be a pity if it doesn’t come out. The review of Karyshev’s hook should be sent to St. Petersburg, perhaps there are not ten printer’s signatures and that is the reason for the delay. Well, that’s enough gossip. Many, many kisses for you and Manyasha from me and Volodya. Mother sends best regards. When is Anya arriving?
Yours,
Nadya
Last time I forgot to write that we have received BIos. Does it have to be sent on?
It is strange that no letter from Volodya came with the Karyshev review. I remember that he wrote a letter at the time.[See Letter No. 54.—Editor]

October 14
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Immediately Volodya had left for Krasnoyarsk I wrote you a detailed letter and did the same on his return from there. You have probably received both those letters. Well all that is a matter of the past. It is winter here now, our River Shush is frozen hard, we have had some snow but it has disappeared. It is quite cold (five below), which has not prevented Volodya going off to the island all day to shoot hares, although so far this year lie has not yet managed to dispose of a single hare. He is warmly dressed and it will not do him any harm to get a breath of fresh air; he has recently been buried in his “markets” up to the ears, writing from dawn to dusk. The first chapter is ready now and it seemed very interesting to me. I play at being the “un-understanding reader” and am supposed to judge whether the exposition of the “markets” is sufficiently clear; I try to be as “un-understanding” ns possible, but there is not much I can find fault with. It is awfully strange that we have not yet heard a word from the écri vain about the book, we think it has fallen through. Lately the post has been pretty miserable. Yesterday we had a good laugh; there was nothing in the post except newspapers, and Mother began to accuse the postman of mischievously hiding letters, our friends of being utterly, selfish, us of giving him too few tips; and then she said we grudged money for the postman but otherwise wasted it. Why did we go to see Kurnatovsky the day before yesterday? We only interrupted his work and ate his dinner. In the end we all started laughing and got rid of the unpleasant feeling we always get when there is not much in the post. We did once go to see Kurnatovsky,[They made the journey on October 11, 1898.—Editor] who works at a sugar refinery about twenty versts from here. It was on a Sunday and, although it was cold, the sun was shining in a clear blue sky and away we went. We were dressed in all our winter things, Volodya was in his winter coat and felt boots and they wrapped me in the “family” sheepskin, so that I was covered from head to foot. Kurnatovsky proved to be terribly busy, has no holidays and works 12 hours a day- We really did take him away from his work (but that was good for him) and we really did eat his dinner, too. We looked  over the sugar refinery, the director was unusually attentive to the “important foreigners” (although Volodyn in his felt hoots and quilted trousers looked like the giant from Hop-o’-My-Thumb and the wind had made my hair stand on end); he tried to justify the rotten conditions in which the workers have to work, turned the talk to that subject himself and extended his kindness so far that, despite his elegant and prosperous appearance, he rushed to give Volodya a stool to sit on and himself brushed the dust from it. I almost burst out laughing. In a month’s time Kurnatovsky is coming to us on a visit and perhaps Bazil and Tonechka will also manage to call in some day. I do not know whether Volodya told you that Bazil and Gleb are asking to be transferred to Nizhne-Udiask, where they have been offered jobs as engineers. We now use the Minusinsk library through the people in Tesinskoyo, although he library is a very poor one. Anyway, we have enough books. Anyuta once asked me what I am doing. I am busy on a popular booklet that I want to write, but still do not know how it will turn out.[This appears to refer to Krupskaya’s Zhenshchina-Rabotnitsa (The Working Woman), a book she wrote while in Shushenskoye.—Editor] That, so to say, is my chief occupation and in addition I do whatever else comes along-study English, read, write letters, take an interest in Volodya’s work, go for walks, stitch on buttons …. We are now living like real householders; we have piled stable manure round the bottom of the walls outside our house, put in the double windows, made a wonderful little window that opens to air the rooms, planted a garden beside the house and put a fence round it. We have hired a girl who helps Mother with the housework and does all the dirty work.  Thank  you, dear Maria Alexandrovna, for your offer to send us underwear and household utensils. We do not need any clothes, before we left for Shushenskoye we overhauled our things very thoroughly and as far as household utensils are concerned, we brought some things with us from St. Petersburg and all we need are such kitchen utensils as beaters, tongs, fire irons and similar items. Volodya also has everything he needs; at one time ho had no nightshirts but he bought some material in Krasnoyarsk and now they are ready, but for I don’t know how many days he has been unable to find time to try them on Volodya is always wondering where I get sufficient material for long letters; in his letters he writes only about things of general human interest, while I write about all the little things …. I am still in debt to Anyutn, I have not answered a letter of hers, but tell her not to grumble and not to count letters.

How are you all? Has Manya left? Was she very excited at leaving? Did she go alone or with the Meshcheryakovs? How has D.I.’s affair turned out? Has he received permission to live in Podolsk? Are Anyuta and MT. pleased with their journey? But I could keep on asking questions till tomorrow. Regards to everyone and many kisses for you and Anyuta. Mother sends best regards. Volodya can write himself. Again many kisses.
Yours,
Nadya
What is Manya’s address?

November 11, 1898


We are today still feeling the excitement caused by yesterday’s post. Yesterday we saw a boy from the volost centre climbing over our fence with a huge bundle It proved to be our post, which was of such dimensions that it had to be brought from town wrapped in a sheepskin coat to make sure it was all delivered intact. It was not letters, of course, only books, but sometimes it is surprisingly pleasant to receive books. How are you keeping? Have you made many friends and, in general, do you still like Brussels? I used to receive enthusiastic letters from Meshcheryakov, who was greatly attracted by life in Belgium. Sometimes when I read a letter of his I longed to see how people lived out in the wide world. By the way, you probably get quite a lot of pleasure out of various folk choruses. They say the singing in Belgium is very fine. Glob paid us a visit and one evening he and Volodya sang a little. I thought about you and thought how you would be listening to the Belgians. Gleb stayed four days with us. He came without Zina because Elvira Ernestovna was ill and could not be left. They went shooting but Glob spent most of the time reading the first two chapters of the “markets” You think the “markets” are finished, do you? Nothing of the sort. The book will not be finished until February. Volodya writes all the time from dawn to dusk and has practically no time left for anything else.
Many kisses from me and from Mother.
All the best,
Nadya

22 November, 1898
A.I.,
It is quite a while since I wrote “home”, as I put it. Today, as usual, I am going to chatter about this and that, only I don’t know where to begin, I have forgotten what I wrote last time. The most outstanding event in our life recently was, of course, the arrival of Studies and Essays. We waited and waited and then gave it up; the day before the post came Volodya asked pessimistically what in particular we could hope for in the post. Then one grey morning we saw a boy from the volost centre clambering ever our fence with a huge bundle of something; it turned out to be tremendous numbers of the Studies wrapped in the volest sheepskin …. Our mood soon changed. In his joy Volodya almost agreed to go to a wedding at the Matovs’ (local Jewish shopkeepers for whom Volodya has a special antipathy because of their importunate ways) …. But that was all a long time ago. Volodya has now buried himself resolutely and irrevocably in his “markets”, grudges time for anything else, we have not been to the Prominskys for several months, he asks me to wake him at 8 o’clock in the morning, or at half past seven, but my efforts are usually fruitless, he gives a couple of grunts, pulls the clothes over his head and goes to sleep again. Last night he argued in his sleep about some Mr.N. -on and natural economy …. The other thing that keeps him busy, apart from the “markets”, is the skating rink. On the mitiativo of Volodya and Oscar a skating rink has been cleared on the river near our house; the schoolmaster and some other locals helped.
Yours,
Nadya

January 10, 1899
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Many thanks for the letter and the parcel. We have not received it yet because we have a new postman and the registered mail has been held up. The postman tried to be stand-offish and did not want to take power of attorney to receive correspondence, but now everything has been arranged. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves during the holidays in Minusjnsk and had a break that will last us for a long time. At Christmas almost the whole district was in town, so we saw the New Year in very pleasantly at a big party. When the company broke up everyone was saying “A wonderful New Year’s party?” The main thing was the splendid mood. We mulled some wine; when it was ready we put the hands of the clock at “12” and saw the old year out in proper style, everybody sang whatever he could and some fine toasts were pronounced-we drank ’To Mothers”, “To Absent Friends”, and so on, and in the end danced to a guitar. One of the comrades draws well and he has promised to draw some of the outstanding scenes of the New Year’s party- If he keeps his promise you will get a very good idea of our New Year’s eve. Altogether it was a real holiday. Volodya battled on the chessboard from morning till evening and … won all the games, of course; then we went skating (a pair of Mercury skates was sent to Volodya as a gift from Krasnoyarsk and on these you can cut figures and do all sorts of tricks. I, too, have some new skates, but I skate as badly on the new ones as on the old, or rather I do not skate but strut like a chicken, the art is a little too much for me!), sang in chorus and even went driving in a troika. We wore out our hosts completely! They admitted that another day of it and they would have taken to their beds. E .E. looks much better than she did in St. Petersburg despite her illness (she cannot eat meat or bread at all). She is very pleased with the way their family has taken shape and is afraid only of returning to Russia. There is nothing to be said in praise of the others. Tonechka looks particularly bad—she suffers from anaemia and eczema. Even Zina has grown thin and nervous. They all gasped and expressed astonishment at our healthy rustic appearance, and E. E. even declared that I am fatter than Zinochka. Mother did not go away with us for the holidays and was pretty miserable. They have all announced their intention of coming to us in Shushenskoye for Shrovetide. All of us, the Shushenskoye public, including Oscar and Prominsky, dream of the arrival of the visitors and have already decided who will stay with whom, what treat we can best arrange for them, etc.
However, it is still a long time to Shrovetide and we have returned to our normal occupations and have cleared the skating rink; Volodya is hurrying with his ’markets”. I have received Anya’s letter of December 24 but shall not write a separate letter to her because I would only have to write the same things; there is one little note for her She is indignant that I give my letters to Volodya to “edit” but in most cases I describe our Shushenskoye life in humorous terms and Volodya comes in for a lot of badinage in them; I would not write such letters if I did not give them to him to read before I send them off.
One of the letters I received from the écrivain’s  wife [This refers to N. A. Struve, wife of P. B. Struve.—Editor] informed me that two of her letters to us had gone astray. A pity! About my photograph. Last spring I asked for a family photograph that you liked to be sent to you. Apparently my request was not fulfilled. I am now going to write for my latest pictures to be ordered and sent to Podoisk I do not know if I should have recognised DI. if I had met him in the street, in some other, more suitable circumstances. Perhaps I should. By the way, Vasily Vasilyevich has started reading Bios and has taken it to the factory and asked us to leave it with him for a while, and Zinaida Pavlovna was going to write to her sister in Tula and ask her to send her Bios to Podolsk. That’s that. I must stop I embrace you and Anya fondly and send regards to all. So does Mother.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Many thanks for the parcel, the only thing is ihat you are spoiling us too much. On the whole I must admit I have a very sweet tooth and in self-defence I say that my “organism requires it” (I have to say something). By the way, I am now converting Volodya to my faith. I feed him sweets regularly, every day after dinner and after supper, and every tine he says it’s outrageous”, but eats them and enjoys them. Although we do have enough consuming capacity, we intend leaving some of the sweets for Shrovetide, when we shall be having guests and shall provide the feast of feasts. Here I must stop. I embrace you fondly. Kisses for Azrya and regards to all.
Yours,
Nadya

January 24
Dear Manya,

You are probably thinking that I am a faithless creature-promised to write and then … not a word. If the truth be told, you ought to be scolding me. I intended writing long ago, but kept on putting it off. First of all, let me tell you how we spent Christmas. We had a wonderful time. All the people from the district came into town, most of them for three or four days. There are very few of us in Shushenskoyo and it was very pleasant to be among people. We now know everybody in the district. We had a real festive time-went skating. I was laughed at, but since Minusinsk I have made progress. Volodya learned a lot of figures in Minusinsk and he now amazes the Shushenskoye public with his “giant steps” and ’Spanish leaps”. Another amusement was chess. People played literally from morning to night. Only Zina and I did not play. But even I caught the infection and played once against a poor player and checkmated him. Then we sang, in Polish and Russian. V.V. has a guitar and so we sang to guitar accompaniment. We also did some reciting and talked to our heart’s content. Best of all was our New Year’s party (Volodya, incidentally, was tossed, it was the first time I had seen that performance and I had a good laugh). We are expecting visitors here at Shrovetide. I do not know whether they will come, but I hope they dd. I cannot say that the Minusinsk people look well; Tonechka has awful anaemia and she is terribly thin and pate. Zina has also grown thinner but the worst thing is that she has become extremely nervous; the male side is also weak. Gleb kept lying down, first on the sofa, then on the bed. On top of everything, we wore our hosts out completely. Towards the end of the holidays they were having 10 to 16 people to dinner every day. They themselves admitted that if they had had another day of it they would have collapsed. Mother did not go with us, she was afraid of the cold.
After Minusinsk we returned to our usual occupations. Volodya got down to his “markets”. He is now writing the lost chapter and the book will be ready by February. 1 got a letter from the icri vain’s wile in the last post. The letter was a jubilant one. The new journal Nachalo has been sanctioned, permission for it came quite unexpectedly and the fuss and bother going on there now is something terrible. The letter makes you feel how excited the people there are. She writes, by the way, that the Webb translation is very good, and that it will soon be out. Nice to know. We are having n marvellous steady winter. So far there has not been a suggestion of the terrible Siberian frosts, the sun shines as if it were spring and we are already talking about how the winter passed without our noticing it (although it has by no means passed). How are you getting on there? It seems that you count the letters you get and don’t write very often yourself. That’s not the way. Do you see much of Belgian life? In general, do you like what you have seen of it? But do write more often and I will try to be more punctual. Mother sends her kisses. When will you be going home? You have probably become a real Frenchwoman. I am jealous in advance of your knowledge of the language, how I would like to know even one foreign language thoroughly.
Good-bye and all the best,
Nadya

April 4
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
A couple of weeks ago I wrote to you and, as usual, filled up the letter with all sorts of nonsense. Nothing has changed here, we are all well, and it is warm outside—the temperature reaches 170 and there are dry patches in the fields; we take long walks and we have seen two wild geese and a drake. Volodya has bought himself new waders for shooting excursions, almost to the waist, reads outside in the garden, and goes about in a summer coat, and I recently dug a little ditch wearing no coat at all; I am now thinking seriously of vegetable and flower gardening and pondering deeply over a booklet on the subject sent me by Gleb. As far as my health is concerned I am quite well but as far as concerns the arrival of a little bird-there the situation is, unfortunately, bad; somehow no little bird wants to come. You ask me whether our quarters are big. The apartment is a big one and, if you come-which we would very, very much like-there will be plenty of room for everybody. I remember that I once sent you a plan of the apartment-I am not sure, though, perhaps I only intended sending it. It consists of three rooms, one with four windows, one with three and the other with one. It is true the apartment has one disadvantage—the rooms are all adjoining, but since we are all of one family that does not worry us much. Vulodya and I are thinking of giving you the room we now live in (tile one with three windows) and we will move into the middle one; our present room has the advantage that no one has to go through it to get to another room. However, we shall see. The main thing is that you should be well enough to travel here, my dear; we shall always be able to find room for you. If you come in May, the journey on the steamer will be a good one. We came on the first boat when the countryside was bare, but even then it was beautiful; I think it should be a pleasant journey in summer. The railway journey, however, is very tiring. I believe Volodya has written that the people in Minusiask have changed their minds about spending the summer in Shushenskoye and have rented a cottage near the town, the only one in the district. Do you like bathing? Our bathing place is some distance away-about 20 minutes’ walk. I know Anya likes to bathe. I remember I once came to visit you at Beloostrov and Anya and I went bathing in the rain.
We have received Nachalo from town and Volodya is highly indignant over Bulgakov ’s article and is already thinking out a reply to it. We had to wait quite a long time for that Nachalo. At first I thought the postman had lost the post. He is an awful muddler, that postman of ours-loses a newspaper, forgets to hand over a receipt or takes letters to the wrong address. I am always cursing him under my breath with all the Siberian swearwords. But enough of that. This letter will probably arrive just in time for Easter. Although Volodya objects, I intend to colour some eggs and make an Easter cake from curds. Do you know that it is the custom here at Easter to decorate the room with spruce boughs? It is a very pretty custom and we intend to ’keep” it (I nearly wrote ’keep it up”, but then remembered that next Easter we shall be in Russia again). Mikh. Al. and Kurnatovsky may visit us. Good-bye. Many kisses for you and Anya. Regards to all, from Mother as well.
Yours,
Nadya

June 20
It is ages since I wrote to you, dear Maria Alexandrovna. Somehow I could not get down to writing, especially as I thought you might still be coming here. Now I don’t want to put off my letter-writing any longer. We are all the same as ever. Volodya is busy reading all kinds of philosophy (that is now his official eccupation)-Holbach, Helvdtius, etc. My joke is that it will soon be dangerous to talk to him because he has soaked up so much philosophy. There is no shooting for the time being and the famous gun is scarcely ever taken out of its cover. We go for our daily walk and swim regularly, we pick sorrel, berries, etc., and Volodya gathers everything with the enthusiasm of a hunter; I was surprised one day to see him tearing up sorrel with both hands …. There has been a let of talk about shooting expeditions; the places they intend to go to—some place called Forty Lakes, where there is so much game they will need a cart to bring it home, and so on. All that will be after St. Peter’s Day,[July 12, N.S.—Editor] and we intend going to Minusinsk at that lime, probably on the steamer; we have already received permission. We had visitors recently; first there was Anatoly and his wife, and then Lepeshinsky and his wife and three-months-old daughter. Anatoly looks very bad, he is not likely to get better and his wile is completely broken, such a quiet little thing. Even the favourable climate here can no longer help Anatoly. The Lepeshinskys filled our apartment with hubbub—the baby’s cries, lullabies, etc—the two days they were here. They have a fine little girl, but the two parents are so fond of her they don’t give her a moment’s rest—they sing, dance and pester her all the time. No new people have been sent here and since summer began Oscar and Prominsky have been putting in an appearance lass often, both of them are busy in the vegetable garden. Mother and I have planted a lot of things (even melon and tomatoes) and we have been eating our own radishes, lettuce and dill for a long time. The flower garden is also in bloom, there are blossoms on the mignonette, and the others (stocks, sweet peas, daisies, pansies and phlox) will be blooming in the more or less distant future; the garden gives Mother pleasure, too. The girl who worked for us last winter is staying on this summer, so the housekeeping is no bother. Since only seven months remain before we leave, the talk often turns to the subject of Russia and Volodya intended writing to you about our plans in that direction. How are you keeping? Have you got rid of your fever, and Aayuta of her cough? I have not answered Anyuta’s letter but she should not be angry as I had intended having a good chat with her when we met. It is a great pity you are not coming here, but it is not long before we return to Russia and if we get away from here at the proper time we shall be home in Russia by February. Then you will see how Volodya’s health has improved in Shusheaskoye; you cannot compare him with what he was in St. Petersburg. I embrace you fondly, my dear—keep. well. Many kisses for Anyuta and Manyasha, regards to M.T. and D.I. Mother sends regards to all.
Yours,
Nadya

July 3
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Yesterday I received your letter of June 16. We are getting our letters written today because we had intended to go visiting, but it is doubtful whether we shall make the trip since some “weather” is beginning. Volodya must have praised it too much-the kept saying “lovely, lovely weather” and now it has changed till it is like nothing on earth. There is wind every day that makes the shutters rattle. But it isn’t cold and we take a daily walk as we did before. Although the shooting season has begun, Volodya has not yet got “hunting fever”. He has been shooting only a couple of times. He shot some grey-hen and we made some good meals off them. We keep intending to go visiting, we have permission to go to town, but the permit is lying at the volost centre and we don’t know whether we shall go or not. We were all ready to go when we learned that Vasily Vasilyevich was at the factory and on his way back would call for us to go with him-and we have invited Glob and Zina to come at that time… I want to see Zina and have a chat with her, it is a long time since I last saw her. The only thing is that after all these meetings with comrades one feels somehow dissatisfied. You intend to say everything there is to say but when you meet the talk somehow gets pushed into the background by all sorts of excursions, chess playing, skating, etc. The result is more like fatigue than pleasure. However that may be, it is good to see people. We have heard from Yermakovskoye that Anatoly is very bad, Lepeshinsky’s wife is a nurse and she thinks the end is net far off. The doctor at Yermakovskoye is a great optimist and assures Deminika that there is still hope. About Mikh. Al—he is all alone because his flancée[O. A. Papperek.—Editor ] has postponed her arrival until the end of summer. Yermakovskoye is now the most populated place in our district. I have been wondering all the time whether they will send anybody else to Shushenskoye, but they have not done so. Prominshy’s time will be up in the autumn and the main question for them now is whether they will go home at the cost of the government; it is a big family, eight of them, and they will never manage It on their own resources. In the time we have been here we have got quite used to our Shushenskoye comrades and if for any reason a day passes without Oscar or Prominsky coming we feel that there is some. thing missing …. Why is Lirochka so bored? She wrote to us that she has so much work she has to get up at 5 or 6 in the morning to get everything done. It is true that all her work is the sort that gives her little satisfaction, but that is something she cannot change. Kazachinskoye is no worse than any other place. I should very much like to see her but now I am hardly likely to. If she is transferred to our district, it will be when we are no longer here.
Well, good-bye. Many kisses. Mother, sends very best regards. Has Anyuta left yet? If not, kiss her for me, and kiss Manya, too, many, many times.
Yours,Yours,
N. Ulyanova

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
It is quite a long time since I wrote to you and I have not even answered Manyasha’s letter of September 14 and my conscience is troubling me on account of it. There is nothing new to write about and I have described our daily life many times. A few days ago Kurnatovsky visited us and he told us about the people at Yermakovskoye. A son has been born to Dominika but the child is ill, they think it is consumptive, and she herself is sick all the time and very miserable. Mikh. Al. has been found fit for service in the army and he is now enjoying his last few months of freedom. In December he will be sent nobody knows where but for the time being he is very busy. His wife is always rather poorly, she is miserable and amuses herself by taking walks in the vegetable garden with a calf and her dog, Kurtashka. They promised to come to us as soon as the sleigh road is open. On the two days Kurnatovsky was with us, the men all went out shooting first thing in the morning; Kurnatovsky is fanatically keen on this sport. Somebody has beard from Kazachinskoye that Yakubova has disappeared from there, enquiries are being made about her everywhere, and the people at Yermakovskoye have been asked whether she has been there; according to their information she was there a week ago. There are rumours that she has escaped abroad, somebody has seen her in Berlin. So that’s that.
It is already autumn hero and soon we shall go skating. That will be better because we have got rather fed up with walking and Volodya’s shooting will soon he over. He is now busy with the Webbs’ book. He has to work on alone because two of us together take longer. It is boring enough work because the translation is a poor one and it has to be almost all retranslated. Actually I don’t do anything arid I don’t know where all the time goes. There remain three months and 13 days to the day of our departure, that is very little. I have already applied to the police department for permission to go to Pskov. Mother intends to make the same application in her own name.
Well, good-bye. Many kisses, regards to all,
Yours,
Nadya

There have not been any letters from you or Anyuta for a long time. It looks as if my last “collective” letter was not to your liking. Somehow I could not write at that time. The Siberians recently gave me a good trouncing for a “collective” letter. Volodya came in for a good dose, too; he wrote a letter of twenty lines for five persons and expected to get five letters in answer to it. They made merciless fun of him. So that was that. Congratulations, dear Marusya, and here’s wishing you all the best, Since I have written all the gossip  about myself in a letter to Maria Alexandrovna,[This letter has been lost.—Editor] I am going to write about mutual acquaintances. Yegor came to see us. I was awfully glad to see him because I had not known what to think about him. He looks radiant and very much alive. He kept talking the whole time without a stop: He told us that Vastly Vasilyevich had got a good job in Omsk. that Tonya had given birth to a girl and that both were doing well, E.E. is in ecstasies over her granddaughter (she was quite indifferent to the first). Gleb has also got a good job, assistant manager of a railway depot near Tomsk. So far, Zina is still in Nizhneudinsk. And so everything is all right with them. But poor M.A. is having a bad time in Riga. He wrote that the barracks were worse than a prison; he is not allowed out alone, always in the company of a soldier, and then only as far as the shop. They took away all his books except the German dictionary and Civil Law. The food is bad and he cannot take any into the barracks, it would be stolen immediately. The clothing they gave him is so bad he had to get some of his own. The worst thing of all is that MA. has been posted to the very company that dealt brutally with the workers; the soldiers received an award of 10 rubles each for killing a worker, and when they were on patrol they opened fire on their own initiative. So you see!
The comrades in Minusinsk are all keeping well. I recently received a letter from them which made me very glad. Altogether, I never imagined that I had become so fond of the Minusirisk crowd. Baramzin, the man we left our dog with, intends to bring us (really to Volodya) a drawing of her, he draws very well. Our dog seems to be having a good time end has become a general favourite. Talking of the dog reminds me of Lirochka. She once passed on some instructions through ne, and one of them concerned a most detailed description of a moth-eaten mongrel. One of our mutual friends recently got a letter from her and sent me an extract from It. I was not at all pleased with the theoretical part of the letter. She says that Bernstein offers nothing in the way of theory- “That is some sort of idiocy!” But the practical significance of the book, she says, is tremendous; he has turned his attention to the needs of the masses and calls for reality, for concrete things. She believes the book to be a success because the orthodox trend had begun to pall. She says about the resolution[This apparently refers to the “Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” (Collected Works, Vol. 4, pp. 167-182).—Editor] that here energy ands an outlet in Inventing a path that development must follow. In general, Lirochka to me is now an X. She and I formerly held astonishingly identical views, but something has been happening to her in the past three years and I don’t understand her any more. Perhaps we would come to an agreement if we met, but there’s something lacking in our correspondence. She is not the Liroclika I knew and it is no use writing about mists, weather and so on, and she doesn’t seem to want to write about anything else, and she can’t, anyway. To tell the truth, I cannot reconcile myself to her marriage. Her husband[K. M. Takhtarev.—Editor] created the impression on me of a kind of narrow self-assurance …. But I have said too much on this subject. Good-bye. Kiss Anyuta and give M.T. my regards.
Yours,
Nadya

Dearest Manyasha,
The day before yesterday I sent a letter to you and MA. and yesterday got one from you. I am very glad that MA. may possibly go to visit Volodya, as it looks as if I shall not be able to move from here for a long time. Yes, Volodya has got thinner, but it was only very recently that he lost weight, before that he looked very healthy. I think it is not so much the catarrh that bothers him as insomnia. Recently his insomnia has been chronic, he was very excited before our departure and the frosts were so fierce that he did not go out at all. As soon as we set out Volodya cheered up and began to eat and sleep properly. I think he will be able to check the catarrh with the waters that did him good before; in general, Volodya takes care of his health. He writes that lie is being well fed. It is a pity, of course, that he has to live away from the family.
I gathered from your letter that Yuly came to see you and so all my news is now stale.
I am sending you ray translation and the book. I don’t understand any of the underlined passages and, apart from that, I imagine I have translated a lot of the rest all wrong. I do not know the language at all, and the dictionary is little help; one phrase often has several meanings the way I read it. You must take a look at the entire translation and correct it where it is nrong. That’s all. Good-bye, my darling Englishwoman. Many kisses for M.A. and Anya.
Yours,
N.U.

July 26 
Dear Maria Alexandrovna, 
I have just received a postcard from Volodya, sent from Austria ….
The letters are a long time on the way—I got the postcard on the eighth day, which means I shall receive Volodya’s letters on the ninth or tenth day. Voiodya writes that he feels very well and ’I am very, very pleased about it, of course, How are you keeping? Are you quite well? After the impassable mud and the dampness here, we are now enjoying wonderful days. You are probably having excellent weather too and you cars take advantage of the summer. Things are all right here now. I am sorry you and Anyuta got such an unfavourable impression of Ufa; the weather was terribly muggy at the time and our place was all higgledy-piggledy. We are still living in the same apartment but we shall probably soon be moving to a winter apartment, an excellent one that we have tried, across the road diagonally from us. I am now quite well and so is Mother. She sends you all her regards.
When Volodya was staying here in Urn he wrote Filippov a scathing letter about his having printed Volodya’s article in such distorted form.[The letter has been lost. The article was “Uncritical Criticism (Regarding Mr. P. Skvertsov’s Article ’Commodity Fetishism’ in Nauchnoye Obozreniye No. 12, 1899)” (Collected Works, Volume 8, pages 609-832).—Editor.] A letter came from Filippov after Volodya had loft in which he tried to gloss it over. ’Dear Sir, an opportunity of settling the affair has occurred. I am sending you the manuscript of Skvortsov’s article, so that you can reply. I ask you to hear the censorship conditions in mind and keep the article short.” It seemed as if he wanted to appease Volodya by sending him the article, but two days later he changed his mind and sent another letter, this time not for forwarding to V.I. as before, but to be forwarded to Mr. Ulyanov. The outward appearance of the letter alone was evidence of his disdain—a torn-off half sheet of paper on which the letter had been typed with corrections to the typing. The letter was foolishly abusive, the man does not seem to understand what he is talking about. I wrote him that I had received the two letters and could not send them on to Volodya because I did not know his address, but would send them immediately I did; I said I was returning the manuscript because if it were sent abroad there would be a long delay in getting it printed and the author would hardly be likely to approve of it. Volodya would probably not want to accept favours from that idiot. Skvortsov’s article is also excessively abusive. The same meaningless quotations from Marx and complete failure to understand one’s opponent. There is no point even iii polemicising with such a person. I doubt whether Volodya will answer him.
Maria Andreyevna called the day after Volodya’s departure. She was very nice and awfully kind. I felt a twinge of conscience—I do not know how to he nice to people. I wanted to demonstrate my kindness by offering to help her make jam, only I remembered in time that I had never made any jam and the Lord alone knows what I might have made …. They are going to live at the farmhouse all the winter …. Well, good-bye. Many kisses for you and Anyuta and I will drop Manyasha a few lines.
Yours,
Nadya

Thank you, Manyasha dear, for the books and the photograph that is probably your doing—and for the postscript to Volodya’s letter. I have been intending to write for a long time but kept on putting it off. How are you all? I have not heard anything of you for ages. When are you thinking of returning to town, what plans have you made for the winter? When I received a letter from Volodya saying that Maria Alexandrovna and Anyuta were coming with him I was very glad and thought I would be able to discuss everything with Anyuta. There are many things I wanted to talk about. When they arrived, however, I was so distracted that all my ideas flew away—and there were other visitors here besides the family. It turned out that I did not have a real talk at all and I do not know when I shall see them again. Oh well, we shall see what will happen; I have only seven and a half months left to remain in Ufa, the time will pass very quickly. I have found pupils to teach and am taking German lessons myself. I have discovered a German from Berlin and with some difficulty persuaded him to talk to me twice a week. So far we have had only one talk. The German is a chatterbox, so I may get something out of it. In addition to that I have been reading the silliest German novels and have been so busy at my German that I do not go anywhere; I am becoming unsociable and have no desire to go anywhere. Good-bye. I embrace you fondly.
N. Ulyanova
P.S. Did Volodya tell you that a young lady from here is coming to see you? She is the niece of an old acquaintance. Tell her whatever you can about studies at Brussels University.

August 26
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
It is again a long time since I wrote to you, but all I have to write about is myself and that is boring. Nevertheless, I will write. I am keeping perfectly well, so is Mother. It is three weeks now since we moved to a new apartment. It is very convenient, downstairs, two rooms and a kitchen, newly decorated, and a garden under our windows; the owners are nice people. We lived in this apartment once before, but now it has quite a different appearance. Our address is Priyutskaya Street, Kulikova’s House. We seem to have settled down at last. I am now pretty busy; I still retain my summer pupils and winter lessons have also begun. Two lessons will remain for the winter, both quite pleasant and paying quite well (62 rubles). I shall spend about C hours a day on them. Since I like teaching, it will be quite all right, not a bit tiring. The bad thing is the mud in Ufa, you can drown in it, and in the evenings, when there is supposed to be a moon and the streets remain unlit for that reason, you are quite likely to land up in a ditch—and one of my lessons is in the evening. On Sundays I take German lessons from an excellent German. Everything would have been all right except that there has been so much commotion at our place lately that I have not been able to take up a book for a fortnight. And so I have not been busy at my German at all and that is a great pity. Volodya complains of the turmoil of life in Paris, but that is Paris and turmoil is in the nature of things; but when there is turmoil in Ufa it is like nothing on earth. This, of course, is the time when some people are going, some are coming and others are passing through. People passing through say that Zina is very miserable, that she has recently changed very considerably, and grown thin and pale. They also say that Mikh. Al. is having a bad time, and that O,A. could not find any pupils for a long time. Mikh. Al. has been posted to the Krasnoyarsk Regiment, a regiment that was about to set out on a march (it has started by now). The Siberians are lazy correspondents and so I know little about them. I am partly to blame, by the way. Lidya intends moving to Ufa, she has made an application, but I don’t knew whether she will be able to get transferred; I should very much like to see her before I leave here. Yolodya writes very rarely and, has apparently given me the wrong address, since be does not seem to have received my letters. I am now writing to him in Paris. I don’t know where to send the magazine he asks for, Zhizn. In the end I shall probably send it to you, perhaps he has given you his proper address. I gathered from his last letter that he is leaving Paris but he did not say where for. I am returning Manyasha’s French hook together with Zhizn. She wrote that she had to return it in September. Anyuta, by the way, took a Gorky book to read in the train and its owner is asking for it back; if it is not too much trouble, please send it to me. I ask Manyasha to excuse me for not writing to her separately—I should only have to repeat everything. How are you? Are you keeping well? Has Anyuta gone for long? Have you received a reply from St. Petersburg about whether D,I. has been accepted into the University? Are you moving to Moscow soon? Well, good-bye. Many, many kisses for you and Manyasha. Mother sends regards to all.
Yours,
Nadya
 P.S. Have just made a discovery—I have not got the issue of Zhizn that Volodya wrote about and so am sending only the French book.

September 11
Our letters must have crossed in the post, Manyasha dear. At the end of August 1 wrote to Maria Alexandrovna a most minutely detailed letter describing my way of life. I wanted to send the French book with a young lady who was supposed to come to visit you but who, it turned out, had found a travelling companion to go to Paris with; I think she is going to Paris for no particular purpose, just for amusement, she has not much intention of studying and cannot come to Podolsk. And so I sent the book to you by post, I did not go to the post office myself and in my hurry forgot to write “Registered” on the parcel and so it went by ordinary book post. I am afraid it might get lost. Please write and let me know if you received it. Speaking of books—when Volodya was staying here he promised to send an acquaintance The Development of Capitalism but forgot to do it and now asks for it to be done. To prevent any unnecessary posting please send one copy direct to the following address: Birsk (Ufa Gubernia), Pavel Fyodorovich Savinov. I think that is all there is to be done. Has D.I. got anything? When are you moving to Moscow? Are you all well? When is Anya returning?
There are no changes here, we are both well. I am busy with my teaching, I teach all subjects, even Latin; there are crowds of people here with nothing to do, as before; I am busy with German but there seems very little time for it. It is, of course, much easier to study the language with a German teacher than to work alone. Volodya seldom writes, says little about himself and complains of the turmoil. Olga Alexandrovna is not coming to Ufa because she has got fixed up in Krasnoyarsk, and Mikhail Alexandrovich is in the regular army. Zina is anxious to get to Russia and does not write in very great detail. I am expecting to see a returning comrade in a few days; he should have passed through here a long time ago but he was taken ill with dysentery just before he left and is still recovering slowly.
Here in Ufa there is absolutely impassable mud such as I have never in my life seen before, and all the time it is raining, raining ….
Perfectly beastly.
Well, good-bye, many kisses for you, for you and Maria Alexandrovna. Regards from Mother.
Yours,
Nadya

Bakhmetyevskaya Street.

October 1, 1900

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

I received a letter from Manya a longtime ago but, as usual, allowed other things to intervene. You probably moved to Moscow a long time ago. How are you? Are you keeping well? Has D.I. left for Yuriev? Will Manyasha’s case soon come to an end?[Lenin’s sister Maria Ilyiniclina Ulyanova was arrested on September 30, 1899 and sent to Nizhny Novgorod until the preliminary investigation was over. She returned to Moscow at the end of December.—Editor] I once received a letter from Anyuta and answered it immediately, but my letters are not always delivered at the proper time and I sometimes receive letters from Volodya in different order from what he wrote them in. Although Voiodya now writes more frequently, I still know very little about the way he is living there; I know he has taken up some English language courses, and that he cannot get into his stride …. Zina and her husband blame me for not writing enough about Volodya, but what can I write to them? Volodya is quite unable to write about the ordinary side of life. Let him write to them himself. They are not thinking of moving to Russia yet and have not done anything about it-I think they should. It will soon be March 11 and even Zina will be her own mistress then. Five months and eleven days-I no longer know whether that is much or little. I do not know whether I shall be able to leave Lila on the 11th by the morning train as I have long been intending. Incidentally, there is nothing so very bad about Ufa except the mud, and I have long since become an Ufa patriot. We have fixed ourselves up well—in provincial style—a good apartment, good food, etc., in short we have adapted ourselves somewhat to provincial life. Time goes like a machine that has been wound up and I have some nice children as pupils. In general, I am very fond of teaching children, and at the moment the children are very nice, especially one tiny little girl. I give lessons to the numerous progeny of a local millionaire merchant—he has five of them. They are very strict, the way our merchants are, and I actually like the way the children are brought up. The parents do not dress them up, they have very few toys, no nursemaids, plenty of freedom, the youngsters are in the street all day, the children clean their own boots, tidy up their rooms (even wash clothes). In general, there is nothing aristocratic about them and they are not spoiled. They all learn very willingly, both the youngsters and the older ones. The youngest girl (seven years old) is very nice, a delightful character, clever, pretty, and such an industrious and attentive pupil I have never seen. Every day she is. “simply longing” to read, write and do arithmetic. And when there is something just a bit more interesting, her eyes flash. She now waits for me every time on the staircase and reports to me on all the events in the lives of the children. In short, this little girl has completely captivated me. Such wonderful children do exist! She is a happy-go-lucky kid, laughs a lot and has not been drilled (sometimes she wipes her nose on her frock). There is also a nice boy, but of a different kind. In general, I usually get interested in the boys and girls I teach, the pity is that the lessons take up too much time, they are foolishly arranged. I have taken up some French language courses here (soon German courses will open). Three times a week, an hour a time, six rubles a month; the courses are conversational, and so far I ant very satisfied. I am the senior in a group of four. The Frenchman is an experienced teacher and conducts a very lively lesson, but the pupils are rather inert. It is a pity I have no French books here at all, and the French teacher gives us June newspapers to read or magazines with no beginning and no end. Has Manyasha (she probably lies) any French fiction or, in general, any French books? None of the people here know any languages, so I with my half-baked knowledge am considered a specialist in this field; it is difficult to get any foreign books. I also go to the German teacher and write essays ten pages long for him, but we meet only once a week and that is too little for practice. I read German fiction on my own, but it’s still more difficult for me to speak German than French. And that is how the day passes up to 8 o’clock in the evening, and in the evening lam rarely able to do anything, few evenings pass without somebody calling in. There you have the smallest details of the way I spend my time. Mother sends her best regards and I send many kisses. I shall not write a separate letter to Manyasha since I should only have to repeat what I have written, but instead I simply embrace her, That’s all. All the best.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
November 8
I received your letter a few days ago and yesterday a letter from Manyasha with newspaper cuttings enclosed; many thanks, I have already read them.
I recently wrote to you, but our letters, as usual, crossed in the post. I am now better, but Mother is still feeling rather bad, first she has palpitation, then she catches cold. We now have an excellent apartment, oven a piano. We have an acquaintance who sings well and we manage some music in the evenings, rather strange music, it is true, for the piano groans, wheezes and rattles, but still it is music. Visitors make Mother tired and I, too, would be glad if they did not come so often; the fact of the matter is that I come home so tired at nine o’clock that there is not much I can do, anyway.
A few days ago I got a letter from Volodya that was two and a half weeks on the way and another that took a fortnight. The letters take a terribly long time to come. Votodya advises me to make a start with my English but I don’t suppose I shall follow his advice. I have arranged with the German to have lessons three times a week and things will go better. Apparently I have been infected by Volodya’s idées fixe—I must master languages at all costs. I now have some other work in addition to my teaching and language lessons and in the spring I will tell you all about it in detail. Only four months are left to March, when I shall come to you and then go on to Volodya. At the moment I am not allowing myself to think deeply on this subject, because if I do the time will drag heavily.
 I don’t know what to do about getting to Moscow in spring; I suppose it would be the wrong thing to tender an application beforehand. But why should I start guessing in advance? Spring is a long way off. It is winter here, a good, healthy winter. I hope the time will pass quickly for you until Christmas, and that at Christmas…[The end of the letter has been lost—Editor]

Dear Manyasha,
Many thanks for the album, excuse me for the trouble I have caused you in getting it sent on; thanks also for bothering to supply me with French books. I have not yet managed all the old ones for I read terribly little. I know very well that unless I read I cannot master a language, but there is no tine. How I sometimes envy you your solitude! It would give me the greatest pleasure to pore over my books of an evening, but I never manage to. Hustle, bustle and again hustlel One would have thought this could be avoided in Ufa. I do not know how it happens because I am not, I believe, very sociable. It is true that I have lost my shyness, only on rare occasions am I overcome by a sudden wave of shyness and cannot utter a word; now, however, that rarely happens and soon passes, but it used to be a real misfortune. That is why I understand you so well when you write about your being shy. I know what a tormenting feeling it is and how difficult it is to get over it…
I have another request to snake of you. Volodya asked for someone to write to Filippov about manuscripts and about payment for the Skvortsov article. I am writing about the manuscripts today but a letter must be written to Soikin  about payment, mentioning the exact number of pages. I have not got a copy of Nauchnoye Obozreniye  handy, so I cannot count the number of pages; more important than that-I am afraid there may be some delay in sending the money and that I shall have left Ufa in the meantime—I want to avoid complications. It is also possible that Filippov has sent the money to Moscow and that may make things awkward. So please write to Soikin in Volodya’s name telling him to send the money to you. I think it would be better to do this before the New Year.
What were you sick with? What did you have, influenza? I hope you have completely recovered …. Have you? And is Maria Alexandrovna keeping well? For some reason you did not write anything about her. What are you doing? What are you reading?
If you have not gone abroad by that time we shall see one another in March. Only three and a half months left, actually not very much. Do you know, I sometimes wonder whether I shall be given a passport to go abroad with Volodya away, perhaps his consent is necessary. Do you know whether Mark Timofeyevich’s consent was required before a passport was issued to Anyuta? In general, as we get nearer to March 1 am getting alarmed at the possibility of delays. It is true that Volodya’s letters have now become calmer and he writes that he is quite well, but it would not be a bad thing if those three months passed more quickly.
The Siberians write very seldom, and from, people passing through I have learned only that Glob has grown thin and Zina has got fat. That’s not much.
Well, good-bye, I embrace you fondly and kiss you. Many, many kisses for Maria Alexandrovna as well. Mother sends regards.
Yours,
N. Ulyanova

December 22
Dear Maria Alexandrovna and Manyasha,
It seems quite a time since I wrote to you. Today I am in something of a holiday-eve mood and I am spending the day in a most unusual manner. I shall not have any lessons for a fortnight, yesterday I gave my last lesson, my French teacher has also gone away for the holidays,. and so 1 am, as the saying goes, as free as the birds of the air. I began today by cleaning up the house and then got down to letter-writing and finishing off all kinds of unfinished jobs. I wanted to write you a letter for Christmas but I have been so busy, and this letter will probably arrive in the New Year, if you bear in mind the holidays and the snowdrifts. I wish you, dear people, a happy New Year; I send you many kisses and wish you good health and everything, everything that is good. I hope that this year I shall be able to spend some time with you. Mother also sends her best wishes. Here it is ’seriously” cold, thirty below zero every day, and sometimes there is a snowstorm on top of the frost. I parade in Mother’s fur coat and felt boots and she does not go out at all-the cold immediately takes her breath away. The post is greatly delayed by the snowstorms.
How are you spending the holidays? Has DI. arrived? Oh, there’s something else—what is Anyota’s address? I wrote to her at Volodya’s address a long time ago and do not know if she received my letter. I’d like to write to her, but I don’t know where to send a letter. Olga Alexandrovna, from whom I recently received a letter, is also asking about the address. What a pity, Manyasha dear, that they would not let you go abroad-I had already begun to envy you. Perhaps we shall be able to go together. I am trying not to think of spring and my journey yet; if I do, I get lost in wild ideas. People had a good laugh at my expense yesterday, I started crossly trying to preach that it was essential to maintain an even temper and got so angry that I proved brilliantly that I was not even-tempered myself. Unfortunately my acquaintances are all nervous wrecks, people with “moods”; of course, if one’s nerves are out of order there is nothing one can do about it, only why let oneself go-that I cannot stand.
Olga Alexandrovua writes that they are badly off; she is living in Krasneyarsk where Mikhail Alexnndrovich enjoys some privileges on account of her. She has one small lesson, a poor one, and hopes to find another. MA. gets terribly fatigued by army service and is bored by doing nothing and being a soldier. All the Siberians write regularly, except the Taiga and Omsk people, who maintain an unconscionable silence. Gleb, they say, is completely worn out at his job; I am surprised that they hang on there. We live on the main highway and people are passing through all the time so that we have a life of variety. Not long ago one of our Minusiosk acquaintances was here; he had been released for a month to visit his mother. By the way, Manyasha, you asked me about 0.,[This refers to G. I. OlcuIova.—Editor] you wanted to know what sort of person she is. I have very little personal knowledge of her but have heard many good things about her. I had intended to send a letter with her but, first, she did not go direct and, second, I had influenza at the time and could not think properly. I thought she would get to know Anyuta. Here I am, chattering away nineteen to the dozen. My study of languages is making poor headway. I suppose I am not good at them.
And so, good-bye. Once more I embrace, and kiss you; regards to M.T. and D.I.
Yours,
Nadya

The Kautsky translation[This refers to the manuscript of Lenin’s translation of Karl Kautsky’s book Bernstein und des soziaidemokratische Programm. Eine Antikritik, Stuttgart, 1899,—Editor] is not here now, it was sent temporarily to Astrakhan, it will be returned soon, but Volodya has asked for it to be sent to him, only, I don’t know if it’s fit for posting, it has acquired such a battered look.

February 2
Dear Manyasha,
I have not answered your last letter until now because when I received it I wrote to Astrakhan asking them to send me the Countercriticism quickly; so far I have not had a reply but expect one in a couple of days. In the meantime ask Filippov for the translation, I wrote to him once at Volodya’s request, asking him to send all Volodya’s manuscripts to your address. I suppose he has not sent them.
I was beginning to let my correspondence lag but today I am in a tranquil mood and am, therefore, inclined to chatter, although there is actually nothing to chat about. Nothing here has changed except that the sun is shining in a joyful, springlike way, and I just dream of spring, I keep returning to the idea that there are only six weeks left and, then … then I shall be quite crazy with joy, especially when I have travelled to where Volodya is. At present there is no time to get really bored, there is plenty of work of all kinds. I ought to be trying to get everything done in time, but sometimes I laze around unpardonably, really unpardonably. I feel the urge to go out and sometimes, instead of sitting down to work, I go wandering about the streets and once I started reading a novel first thing in the morning. The boredom in Ufa is terrible, but you can build up your health here—I, for instance, have got so fat lately it’s simply awful. But Mother cannot boast of her health, she is always feeling poorly: She is already making preparations to leave, and is busy sewing something and counting the days. After Ufa, you know, only Moscow and St. Petersburg are banned; at least there have been three such cases But people do get terribly attached to one place. They stay put in Ufa, where you can earn good money, or else they move on to Samara. And what’s good about Samara!
Oh how little I read! All this time I have read only Berdyayev. And how poor is my progress with languages. I have not been to the French courses since Christmas because our group broke up and the Frenchman teaches me very perfunctorily when I go alone. I have German lessons on rare occasions. The results depend on my mood, sometimes I chatter away well enough and sometimes I say the weirdest things. All our people in Ufa have now joined forces with Samarskaya Garcia and write for it—so do I.[Samarskaya Garcia (Samara Gazette) No. 36 (February 16, 1901) Published Nadezhda Krupskayo ’s article “The School and Life”—Editor] Since I have so little experience in this field, it causes me plenty of worry. Altogether I am making attempts this year to get into the literary world. Some of the attempts are successful, but the trouble is that I cannot write the way I want to and I just hate my stuff. That’s that. Why don’t you write anything about yourself? How are you? When is your case coming to an end? Good-bye, or rather, au revoir! Many kisses. I fondly embrace Maria Alexandrovna and send her many kisses; I am terribly impatient to get to Moscow. Mother sends regards to all. Goodbye, Manyasha dear, excuse me for my unpunctuality.
Yours,
N.U.
 P.S. Have just made a discovery—I have not got the issue of Zhizn that Volodya wrote about and so am sending only the French book.

Dear Manyasha,
Many thanks for the cuttings. I read them with great interest. I have just received a notice from the post office about the arrival of a parcel. I suspect it is the Kautsky manuscript; if it is, I will send it to you tomorrow for certain. It is a great pity that there has been such a delay. Do you know whether Essays and Studies is obtainable? People are begging me to get a copy, they write that it is not on sale anywhere.
Just a month left. Wonderful, isn’t it? The time will come when there is just one day left! Yes, everything will come!
There is something I almost forgot. Mother has a big request to make of you. She would like you to insure a lottery ticket she has, serial number 7328; this has to be done before March 1 and it cannot be done in UI a because if the ticket wins it will become known here only in April and she would have to come back to Ufa-in short, it would not be worth her while. Keep the receipt yourself. The insurance will cost about three rubles, Mother wanted to send the money now, but I managed to convince her that it would do when she sees you. That’s that.
Are we really going to miss Anya? I want very much to see her. Write and tell me when she thinks of coming. I shall have another journey to make, to Astrakhan, and I do not know whether I should go to Moscow before or after-1 am thinking of making it dependent on when Anya will come.
Well, good-bye for the time being. This week there have been such crowds of people here that I am awfully glad the holidays are over.
Many kisses for you and Maria Alexandrovna, and I embrace you both. Mother sends regards.
Hoping to see you soon.
Yours,
Nadya
Has Filippov sent you pity sort of an answer? The blockhead!

June 11, 1901
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
I have not written all this time because at first I relied on Anynta to describe our way of life and alter that Mother and Volodya wrote to you. We are all quite well, and Volodya shows no sign of catarrh. Mother is also keeping well. She finds life with us very monotonous, but I do not. It is true that Volodya arid I are terrible homebirds. So for I have been to only one picture gallery and know practically nothing about the town. That is partly because it is summer and when we go for walks we go out in the country, not to town. We are living in a suburb where we have the conveniences of a big city—shops, trains, etc—combined with the proximity of the country. Yesterday, for instance, we went for a good walk along the road. It is a marvellous road lined with poplars and with fields and orchards on all sides. We have been for only one long ride and that was not a success—we got caught in a storm arid came hone very tired. We are thinking of going to the mountains some time. Aaynta kept advising us to move to a village for the summer. Mother, too, thinks it would be better, but for many reasons it would be inconvenient. We cannot move too far because Volodya would have to travel to town every day, and that would be too tiring. Apart from that he goes to the library fairly often. There is a park and a place to bathe not far from us—about twenty minutes’ walk, In general life here is gradually beginning to conform to a pattern and Volodya is getting along better with his work …. As far as I am concerned, well, I work very little so far, or, to tell the truth, I do not work at all. Time passes, but where it goes I just don’t know.
I intend to visit the local school, This place is a sort of child’s kingdom. Everybody pays so much attention to them and the children are so nice and healthy. I have been in our city schools and cannot help drawing comparisons; I find that the children here live a lot better. My intentions will probably remain only intentions. Still I have plenty of time. Vodovozova has sent a cheque for six hundred odd marks, but I have not yet received the money or any letter. Altogether people in Russia write terribly little to us, we might well think that all our old friends have forgotten our existence. There has not been a whisper either from Zina or Bazil …. Nor do we know whether Gleb has left that Taiga of his …. Row are you getting on, dear Maria Alexandroyna? Are you keeping well? Give D.I. my regards.
A letter for Manyasha is enclosed,[The letter has been lost.—Editor] and give M.T. my regards. Is there anything new? Is anything more known?
Our people all send regards and I send many kisses.
Yours,
Nadya

P.S. Volodya asks D.I. to send three copies of The Development of Capilalism to the doctor.

July 16, 1901
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Anyuta has sent us your letter to Volodya and also Manya’s letter. Why did they not give Manya my letter? Very odd! It would be a good thing if the rumours that she is shortly to be released came true …. When you see Manya, tell her that I send her my best regards and many, many kisses. I was greatly surprised at the place in your letter where you said that Volodya would know about your way of life from your letter to Mother. That letter must have gone astray because Mother has not received a letter from you and quite recently told me to ask whether you had received her letter. Mother is ill all the time, she has a cough and sleeps poorly. Today she went with us to the bathing place, and got terribly tired, though it is no wore than fifteen minutes’ walk. We go almost every day, the bathing here is excellent and, in general, although we live in a town the country is very near to us. It is a fine place in all respects. It is now quite warm, but not too hot to bear.
The time seems to pass awfully quickly. Somehow you scarcely notice how week after week goes by; it is not as if there was a lot to do, although it seems “you never do anything but are never without something to do”.
I am taking up German again, it’s a nuisance not to know the language; J have found a German woman who will give me lessons in exchange for Russian lessons. We’ll see how it goes. Volodya and I keep intending to go to a German theatre, but we are terribly inactive in this respect, we keep saying “we ought to go” and that is the end of it, for something else always intervenes. Anyuta is more active in that sphere. By the way, I have to admit that our present mood is not very suitable for it. To get the best out of a foreign country you have to go there when you are young and are interested in every little thing …. However, I am in general satisfied with our present way of life; at first it was a bit miserable, everything very alien, but now, as we are beginning to take part in the life of the local people, that feeling is disappearing. The only thing is that people in Russia are miserly with their letters. Well, I must stop. I embrace you fondly, my dear. Keep well and cheerful.
Mother sends regards to you and Dm. I. We are awaiting a letter from him. All the very, very best.
Yours,
Nadya

August 2
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
We received your letter to Volodya yesterday. Unfortunately we see from it that nothing has changed, and I did not write to Manyasha the last time because I thought she would soon be with you. But good things always happen when you least expect them. Sometimes, when I have been away from home a long time and my thoughts have been occupied with something altogether different I find myself coming home with the idea that there simply must be a telegram waiting to say that our folks are with you …. Please, dearest, when you go to see Manyasha, give her many, many kisses from me and give M.T. my regards. I will write to Manyasha.
There are no changes here. Volodya is now working quite hard and I am glad for his sake; when he throws himself completely into some task he feels well and strong-that is one of his natural qualities; he is in very good health, there does not seem to be a trace of the catarrh left and no insomnia, either. Every day he takes a cold rub down and we go bathing almost every day, too. But Mother is always feeling poorly, first rheumatism, then general weakness, and then she catches cold.
In a week or so Volodya and I intend going to Switzerland for a short time to see Anyuta. I am very glad that Anyuta did not go to Rügen, as she originally intended, but to Lake Thun. It is probably better there. We are going for only a few days, but I am looking forward to the journey with pleasure-first, I want to see Anyuta, and second, I want to have a look at the mountains. I don’t know what these mountains are like, I have never seen them, except in pictures. While we are away, an acquaintance of ours is going to stay with Mother, so she will not be afraid of being alone. In the autumn Mother wants to go to St. Petersburg; I am trying to persuade her to spend the winter with us but do not know what she will decide. Summer is drawing to a close and I have not even noticed how it passed; it is as though there has been no summer. Summer is net a real summer in town.
Well, good-bye, dearest, I embrace you fondly and wish you health and strength. Give D.I. my regards and thank him for the book I received a long time ago. Mother sends regards to all.

Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
It is a long time since we had a letter from you and I am beginning to get seriously worried..,. How are you keeping? Where is Anya now? If she is still with you, give her a lot of kisses for me. What about Manyasha? Have you got decently fixed up, have you rented a suitable apartment?
We are all well. This is a wonderful autumn and Volodya and I often go out in the country. Mother is gradually getting used to the new surroundings, although she does not like big cities. She sends her regards to all. I embrace you fondly, you and Manyasha, and Anyuta, too, if she is with you.
Yours,
Nadya

March 4, 1903
 
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
It is ages since I wrote to you, so long that I have even forgotten when I sent my last letter. The fact of the matter is that I have completely forgotten how to write letters and regard them with feelings of loathing. Every time it requires quite a lot of will power to take up the pen. Once I start to write, however, the letter writes itself, I even begin to like it, but it is very difficult to start.
Volodya is not at home now,[In late February and early March 1903 Lenin visited Paris where he lectured at the Russian Social Sciences Higher School and spoke to Russian political émigré on the agrarian programme.—Editor] he has gone for a breath of fresh air. I am always glad when he makes a trip somewhere because it has a very refreshing effect on him. A change of surroundings soothes the nerves-otherwise life drags on very monotonously, the same impressions and the same people day after day. And one does get sick of poring over books. This time I wanted to go with Volodya but again it didn’t come off—a lot of work had piled up and Mother is so very sick that I did not want to, could not, in fact, leave her alone. She has had a very bad attack of influenza and has had to keep to her bed for about a week. At first the doctor was afraid it might be typhus She has now completely recovered, but the weakness remains. She wants to get out into the country as soon as possible, but we shall not be able to manage it before May, and even then I don’t know how. Volodya is not keen ongoing to the country, he is very fond of Prague.[Prague is mentioned instead of London for secrecy.—Editor] I have also got used to Prague but shall nevertheless be glad to get away from here. I should like to write in greater detail about the way we live but there does not seem to be anything to write. How I should like to stay with you now! You wrote about your apartment in your last letter and I got a very clear conception of the way you live there. I was able to picture to myself the frosty weather, the fire in the stove, how you wait for Manya to return from work and how Manya comes in out of the frost. Life in Samara must be like life in Samara must be like life in Ufa. “Give me the wings of a swallow…” But now I am beginning to ramble. Sometimes I feel terribly homesick, today especially. By the way, that is how I am, I am always feeling drawn to somewhere else.
You will probably think we have no amusements at all here, but we go somewhere almost every evening; we have been to the German theatre a number of times and to concerts and we study the people and the local way of life. It is easier to observe here than anywhere else. Volodya is very keen on these observations and gets as enthusiastic about them as about everything he does. It was hard to begin this letter and now it is a pity to stop. I embrace you and Manya fondly, my dear ones. All the best.

Mother sends regards.

M. A. Ulyanova,
Laboratornaya, 12, Apt. 4,
Kiev
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Your letter came as a great shock to us—and it is so sad.[See Note No. 233.—Editor] I can only hope they will soon be released. We have heard that there have been wholesale house searches and arrests in Kiev. During such raids many people are caught in the dragnet. Judging by the fact that they have arrested all of them, the case will be a trivial one. I don’t know what conditions in the Kiev lockups are like now-they used to be bearable. Have they allowed you to see anyone? I have asked an acquaintance of mine to visit you. Since you moved to Kiev so recently, I am afraid you have not got any acquaintances there, the city is a big one and you are strange to it. It’s a great pity that I have lost the address of a friend of Anyuta’s and cannot write to her. I shall await your letter anxiously. Perhaps it will bring pleasanter news.
We are not living too well in Geneva; Mother is often poorly. We feel unsettled somehow and the work goes badly.
Can you send books and things to the people in prison? Have you had any letters from them? Does Mark Timofeyevich intend taking a holiday and visiting you? Mother is sorry she is not in Russia with you. Wishing you health and strength.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
To begin with, let me embrace you fondly. Tins letter is being written mainly to tell you that, because actually there is nothing much to write about. Manyasha has told you about our way of life. It differs from last year only in the apartment being very warns and Volodya having become a stick-at-home. He has been working a lot this winter and lie always feels better when he is working.
For over a week now he has been getting up at eight in the morn-ing to go to the library; he returns from there at 2 o’clock. At first he found it difficult to get up so early, but now he is very satisfied and has begun to go to bed early. It would be a very good thing if he could manage to keep it up.
To think we have been living in Paris for a whole year alreadyl We have become fairly used to it, but it’s a pity we see so little of the real local life.
Recently we went to a little theatre near here and enjoyed it. The audience was pure working class, mothers with babies, hatless, lively and talkative. It was interesting to see the audience’s spontaneous reaction to the play. They applauded not good or bad acting, but good or bad actions. The play itself was just as ingenuous, naive as the audience, with lots of pretty words that suited the taste of the audience. We got the impression of something very lively, very spon-taneous. I was sorry that Manyasha was not there. I was also sorry she was not here when we went to see a demonstration of a hundred thousand people.[A demonstration of 100,000 people took place in Paris on Octo-hero, 1909 as a protest against the execution of Ferrer in Spain; Fentr had been accused of preparing the uprising in Barcelona in July 1909 brought about by the despatch of government troops to Morocco.—Editor.] That created a very strong impression. In general we seldom go anywhere, and if we do, only on Sundays.
How are your eyes? Are they getting better? Mother, too, often complains that it is difficult for her to read in the evenings. Is the light good in your apartment? A pity it’s chilly, though. It’s a good thing you’re living with somebody you know. If they are nice people, it’s much pleasanter. Perhaps you will take a place together somewhere later on ….
Again, I embrace you fondly. Mother-sends very best regards. I wrote to Manyasha recently and yesterday I made a discovery—my letter to her was lying undisturbed in Volodya’s pocket! How many times have I sworn I would never give him letters to post. This time he assured me he would not forget it. But he did!
Yours,
Nadya

August 26 
Dear Maria Alexandrovna, 
I have been intending to write to you for a very longtime, but. there is always something that prevents it. A few days ago we received Anya’s letter. The money, 100 francs, Volodya received a long time ago, but the list of books to be bought and sent with that money has not arrhed. We see from your postcards and Anya’s letter that the arrangement in Berdyansk was not, a real summer affair. It looks urban rather than rural, though, of course, there’s the bathing …. Our summer has not been very fortunate, either. Mother got ill several times, she had pneumonia and the doctor said that her lungs are, in general, Dot in good condition, that she needs rest, good food, and so on. In that, respect our place here is no good; there is not the tiniest garden round the house, not even a yard, and if we want to get out of doors we have to go somewhere, which is not the same thing at all. It is hot in the house and noisy. Although the food is good—we eat in a commune and the cuisine is Russian, filling, home-cooked food-we have to walk a vent through the town and that is very tiring; we have begun taking the meals home but there is the bother of washing the dishes …. In short, it means nothing to a healthy person but is bad for one who is ill. And the heat here is simply unbearable. Mother is better but the illness set her back a lot, she coughs and has fits of depression. 
Volodya is making good use of the summer. lie does his work out in the open, rides his bicycle a lot, goes bathing and is altogether pleased with country life. This week we have been cycling our heads off. We made three excursions of 70 to 75 kilometres each, and have explored three forests-it was fine. Volodya is extremely fond of excursions that begin at six or seven in the morning and last until late at night. But the result is that we don’t get our work done. Still, never mind] The weather is beginning to break. We have the rooms here until September 13, but if the weather keeps fine we can arrange with the landlord to stay longer. That would be good but therwill be a big problem. The commune closes early in September, there is nowhere to cook at home and the restaurant is had and expensive. We have, 
indeed, fixed ourselves up here very cheaply. For the apartment we pay 10 francs a month, dinner and supper cost I franc 30 centimes a head. There are some other expenses, of course, but they are insignificant. Volodya is not sure when to advise Anya to come-now or later, direct to Paris. As regards work-he is busier at the moment, although it is difficult to foresee what will happen in autumn. Living conditions are better in town, things are pretty inconvenient here. 
think Anya should come when it best suits her, it doesn’t make much difference to us. Volodya will be very busy during the next couple of weeks or so. Only she should not come while we are moving; although that does not really matter, either. The moving job is not difficult. How long it is since we met!… 
Well, I have told you everything there is to know about us and now I give you both many kisses. For your health’s sake try to take advantage of the bathing before you leave. 
Mother sends best regards.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Manyasha,
I have received your two letters dated August 29 and 31. Many thanks.
Today, at long last, we moved back to town, there have been some fine autumn days lately, but today it is cold and raining. Mother has caught cold again recently and coughs a lot.
Volodya is going away for a few days,[See Letter No. 220.—Editor] and has asked me to go with him to the exhibition in Turin but I shall not be able to go, although I should like to make the trip. Still, I have had a good rest this summer and am more attracted to books than to holiday-making.
How is Maria Alexandrovna after her journey? Was she very tired?
When does Anya intend coming to see us? I am already in the mood to go sightseeing in Paris with her ….
Many kisses for all of you, regards to MT. Mother sends regards.

Yours,
Nadya
P. S. I will send you a long letter soon. This is only by way of greeting.

March 9
Dear Anya,
This year I have somehow fought shy of letter-writing. Life goes on so monotonously here that I don’t know what to write about. This winter I have been at home working persistently and for months on end have not left this part of the town. It has been raining all the time and I could not go cycling or walking. I have read little and have not been to any lectures. That is probably why I got so fed up with the winter. I am glad that spring has come, it is very early this year. Volodya and I have already been out in the country a couple of times. It is true that after these excursions I was so tired I couldn’t budge, but it was wonderful, all the same. This week has been all going out,We went to the theatre, the play was idiotic, but these French fairly yelled their heads off. Still, there was some wonderful music during the entr’actes—Chaikovsky, Rinsky-Korsakov, Borodin. Today we are going to see Sophodes’ Electra…. And all this because it is spring. 110w you have been spoiling us this year with parcelsl Because of this Volodya has even learned to help himself from the larder and eats out of turn, i.e., not at the proper times. Whenever he comes in, he starts eating. Now he drinks milk before going to bed (instead of wine) and eats eggs in the mornings. I soaked the herring as you told me and they are very nice, like salmon. I am thinking of making pancakes soon.
Mother is not feeling very well. I don’t know what she will do in summer. First she wants to go to Russia, then she doesn’t want to. She asks me to send her regards to all.
I have written about my niece.
We very rarely see M. F., he is very busy. He is in a hurry to finish a translation (this year he has translated three thick books), and has now been given some regular medical translation work. Koiya[M. F. Vladimirsky’s son—Editor.
] is very pleased with his school, they play the gramophone to the children, tell them stories, give them crosses and teach them to write pothooks. He is beginning to chatter in French.
That is all the news. Has Manyasha received my letter? Why has she not written for so long?
I embrace you and Maria Aloxandrovna fondly, Manyasha too.
I should like to write more about Volodya to make the letter interesting, but couldn’t manage It. Another time, perhaps. Regards to M.T. Somehow you all write very rarely.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandroyna,
Your letter was indeed a sad one, one misfortune after another.[See Note No. 311.—Editor] But I do believe Manyasha and Anyuta will soon be released. Judging by the newspapers there are now house searches going on all over Russia, and they are arresting everyone who has been inside before, arresttng them on sight, as a precaution against “scniething happening”, and then, a couple of weeks later, they let them go. I have heard of several such absurd arrests
But it’s a pity you have to worry so much and so deeply while things are being sorted out.
Look after yourself, my dearest. I embrace you fondly, and kiss you.
Yours,
Nadya
Mother sends her very best regards

Dear Maria Alexandrovna and Anya,
The compliments of the season from to and Mother to you and Mark Timofeyevich. Actually there is nothing to write about. Life is very monotonous. I have scarcely any acquaintances hero. 01 late I had been getting to know a young girl-not really a girl but the mother of the sweetest baby girl-but she left for Russia a few days ago.
We go walking every day, but don’t overdo it. The weather is fine, but the mud is awful.
The holidays passed quietly, quite unnoticeably. The libraries here are Polish and there is a University library, but we are always busy and neither Volodya nor I have over been to it.
And we have not been to a concert once.
We are all well.
I embrace you and send many kisses.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna and Anya,
Many kisses for the presents, only it is all so luxurious, we are not a bit used to it. Today Volodya invited some friends to share the parcel and to celebrate some brilliant publishing plans that emerged today. He is letting his dreams run away with him, every day a new book … all his old notebooks have been perused, old lists of figures have been unearthed and the cobwebs wiped lovingly from them.
For the time being many kisses from me and from Mother, who is busy about the house.
About the mustard-that wag Volodya inquiring on his own initiative-I know how to make mustard.
We are having winter weather here again.
The photographs were so good it was a pity to give them up. Volodya was particularly pleased with them.
About publishing and so forth, Volodya will probably write himself.[See Letter No. 233.—Editor]
Yours,
Nadya

March 18
Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
It is an eternity since we had a letter from you or from Anya and we are very worried, riot knowing what the matter is. Perhaps a letter has gone astray, or perhaps one of you is ill. It’s so easy to catch cold in spring! Here the grass is already green and dandelions and daisies have appeared, but there is a most annoying wind. Mother has managed to catch cold and has been wheezing heavily for abouta week. It is a pity she cannot go out. And so we have been thinking that the climate is worse in Saratov and someone may have caught cold. What does Mark Timofeyevich write? Where is he now?
Life here goes on like clockwork and actually there is nothing to write about. We live as we did in Shushenskoye, from one post to the next. Until eleven we fill in the time somehow; at eleven the first postman comes, and then we impatiently await the six o’clock post.
The letters we have been receiving recently are all rather gloomy and so our mood fails into line with them. We live a sort of reflected life.
Still, I am glad spring has come because the las winter seemed a very long one. People are already renting placec for the summer, but things are very uncertain with us. Mother will go first to St. Petersburg if she is strong enough.
The amnesty turned out to be an absolute myth. I do not know how it will affect Manyasha, but sh will get a one-third reduction in any case.[See Letter No. 234 and Note No. 316.—Editor.]
We have not had a letter from Manyasha for a long time and do not know how she is getting on.
I embrace you and Anya fondly and wish you good health above all else. I hope her hand is better and that she will manage to write to us, Volodya, I suppose, will write himself,[See Letter No. 234.—Editor.] Mother asks me to send regards.
In a week or less it will be Easter here—so early[Catholic Poland used the Gregorian Calendar and Easter usually came earlier than in Orthodox Russia which used the Yulian Calendar—Editor.]

Many kisses,
Yours,
Nadya

Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova,
Yekaterininsko-Dvoryanskaya, 40,
Vologda,
Russia
Dear Manyasha,
I congratulate you and send you many kisses. Lidya will stay on at the old place until May because Anna Mikhailovna and Lodik[This refers to A. M. Wrzosek (Basins) and her son.—Editor.] have come to her. She has been getting ill rather often recently. We are moving to the country for five months; it’s lovely there-forest, mushrooms, mountains, and a stream. All I am afraid of is that we shall get bored. It will be good to put Shkurka out to graze. There is a big verandah attached to the house, just right for him to sit and work. It is a huge house, big enough for a whole workshop, but for the time being Shkurka and I will be alone there because Mother is going to Russia for a couple of months. She also sends her congratulations. I am dreaming of being able to work a little in summer, for although I sit over my books I don’t do any reading at all, and I am really terribly anxious to get down to work. This month will be wasted. I am up to my neck in day-to-day affairs and on top of all that it has been discovered that I have thyroid trouble. The doctor has frightened me and every day I go to the clinic for electrical treatment; that takes three hours and after it I wander about half the day like a lunatic. They feed me bromide and, in general, it is all terribly sickening. I intend writing you a long letter but somehow time gets frittered away.
Many kisses,
Yours,
Nadya

 Anna Ilyinichna Yelizarova,
Goncharnaya Street, 11, Apt. 23,
St. Petersburg
Dear Anya,
I have received your postcard with your address. The news about WA. ’s illness is disturbing. What was wrong with her? Has she completely recovered? And how, in general, are they living there? Oh yes, about Beer. To translate it., you must first obtain the permission of the author and then find a publisher. The first can be managed by writing to him, but it will be more difficult to find a publisher. An acquaintance of ours long ago proposed translating Beer and offered it to various publishers, to Semyonov in particular, and they all refused. Volodya at first thought you should translate § 4 and § 5 of Chapter Four and all of Chapter Six for Pros veshcheniye, and then came to the conclusion that it would be better to write an article (about Beer) based on these chapters, leaving out all the uninteresting trivialities (which would make the article more popular in form) but retaining the more interesting passages untouched. If you have received the book, perhaps Manyasha will undertake the job. Volodya has not yet returned.[See Letter No. 246.—Editor. ] This time he will probably be tired after the journey. There is quite a lot of work waiting for him at home. We are already beginning to think about a place for the summer. Volodya wants to go to the same place as last year. The place is good for one’s health, although it pours with rain all the time. The winter has been an unlucky one for us, we have not been able to work much.lt is still three months to summer, by the way. Perhaps you could obtain something about the public education congress, speeches and so on. I need them very much. I have written all about Rabotnitsa[See Note No. 328.—Editor. ] to twenty places. The thing seems to be developing sporadically. Some people seem to have taken the matter up seriously. I don’t know how it will turn out, but Volodya, by the way, will write to you about it. Why are you so much against Siblrsky? I embrace you fondly. I wanted mostly to write to you about Beer.
Yours,
Nadya
Mother sends regards. She is keeping more or less well. I, too, am keeping well on the whole, only my heart gets rebellious occasionally, apparently owing to the thyroid trouble. I want to go to the doctor in a day or two and ask him whether it is not a relapse. I shouldn’t think so.
What does Mark Timofeyevich write?

The periodical for women is developing sporadically solar. Moscow has promised to arrange a social evening to get money for it, but I don’t know whether it will come off. Supplements to the newspaper would cost more and not less- A journal would have an organising significance and in that respect is better than supplements. In St. Petersburg they say "a hundred rubles is not money". I don’t know about that, but somehow we start everything without money. When the first issue appears, perhaps it will be possible to get some, although, I repeat, I don’t see any in the offing.
I am very worried about how the editorial side will be arranged. Things so far are ill a bad way because there are two of us here and two more in Paris, but as far as the fifth member of the board is concerned things are not so simple. There are some very competent people in Paris. You know Lyudmila. The other is still more reliable as far as principles are concerned and whatever she undertakes she does well.[The Parisians were Lyudmila Stal and Inessa Armand.—Editor.] I should like the Parisians to co-opt a third person and have an editorial office there, but somehow this is not being done. The actual editorial office will be in Russia, of course. I do not think this at all important because the matter is such an elementary one that it will not be difficult to come to an agreement. At first there will be some slight confusion, then we shall talk matters over and in the end  we shall be able to work together and everything will be all right. And the disadvantage is that we are not all competent literary workers, and some of our ideas may not be expresned clearly …. Still, I hope everything will turn out all right. Please write more about this matter.
A few days ago I read through all the articles in our newspapers about women’s affairs and saw that the insurance campaign had made the question of women very prominent. I have sent a short article on this issue today. If only I were a competent writer-nothing comes out the way I want it to. While you are writing a thing it. seems good, but when you see it in print you are ashamed to look at it.
I am worried about the article for Prosveszcheniye.[Krupskaya’s article “Results of the Congress on Public Education” was published in 1914 in Prosveshcherdye No. 1.—Editor.] It is written exclusively from newspaper articles, and from very few newspapers at that. The resolutions were reported everywhere very differently and many factual errors may easily have crept in. Apart from that, the article was written at a time when I was feeling very ill and the work did not go well. Then they wrote to me that E. K.[’ It is not known whom this refers to.—Editor]would write about the congress. His reports were the best. I was very pleased, but it was my article that appeared. So there you are.
So please let me have the details about the periodical for women, ’think you will get down to it seriously. It may develop into something big. At any rate i am beginning to get an appetite for it.
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,

Many kisses for you and Manyasha. I received Manya’s postcard and short letter and replied to them the same day.It is pouring with rain from morning to night here, for a whole week I have been unable to step outside except In raincoat and galoshes.[A corner of the postcard has been torn off and the words in brackets have been filled in by the editor according to the sense—Editor] and because of her ill [ness and] the rain she is in a bad [mood].

[We are] travelling. I have made a [discovery]-Based ow’s disease gets a lot [better] from excursions into the mountains, but   in such weather I cannot, of course, go anywhere. By the way, the disease has not made itself very much felt this year. That is all. Again I embrace you.

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
Every day we are expecting a letter from you, but for a long time there has been no news of you, or of Anya, or of Manyasha. The last letter we had was about your going to the country for the summer.[By the way, a letter came later saying that Manyasha is visiting you—NK]
You must be back in town by now. It will he September 11 by the Russian calendar …. Did you have a good rest in summer? I should very much like to know how you are keeping, my dear. Are you quite well?
There are no changes here. We shall soon be returning to town. The mountains do me a lot of good. The thyroid trouble seems to have gone altogether. This last week we have been having magnificent weather and Volodya and I have been up all the nearby mountains. Twice I climbed the Rothhorn, 7,500 feet, which gives you an excellent view of the Alps, without getting a bit tired, and that is something not every healthy person can manage. In view of this I regard my illness as eliminated and em assuming the status of a healthy person.
Now I have a request to make of Anya. During the winter I studied pedagogy quite a let and during the summer have been writing a pamphlet on education. It is almost finished. It will be quite ready in a month and will amount to nearly a hundred pages. The subject is “The Elementary School and Democracyୁ. I have managed to collect quite a lot of interesting material, very little of which has been analysed before. Do you think some publisher might snap it up? I don’t know the present situation on the book market or whether a publisher can be found. I will try writing to Gorbunov, although the subject is one that is only of partial interest to his publishing house.
Today I received the last issue of Rech (August 31), which we have recently been reading with particular interest, it’s a pity we shall not be getting it any more. We don’t receive any other Russian newspapers. In general things are bad as far as Russian newspapers and journals are concerned. In town they are available in the readingroom, but there is a great demand for them and If you come a bit late there’s nothing left; apart from that it is not always convenient to go to the reading-room. So viemenny Mit was sent to an acquaintance from another town for one day. Altogether, on account of the post and the general breakdown everybody gets newspapers by chance.
We are thinking of returning to town in a week. If the weather is very good we shall try to stay a little longer. After all, it does not matter where we live.
Well, I must close. Many kisses for you and Anya and I embrace you both.
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Maria Alexandrovna,
I very much want to write you a few lines and to give you and Anya many kisses. Many thanks to Anya for the trouble she is taking; today I received the Zhurnal Zhurnalov and about a week ago a whole pile of the latest educational publications. I was terribly in need of them. Thanks, many, many thanks. Today or tomorrow I shall write her a long letter. How is Mafiyasha getting on? Volodya is all the time expecting letters from her. Do you know her address?
Again many kisses,
Yours,
Nadya

Dear Manyasha,
Did you receive the long letter I sent you in spring? I wrote then, amongst other things, that Mother had died, gave some details of our way of life, etc.[The letter has been lost—Editor]
Now I am writing for one special reason. We shall soon be coming to the end of our former means of subsistence and the question of earning money will become a serious one. It is difficult to find anything here. J have been promised a pupil, but that seems to be slow in materialising. I have also been promised some copying but nothing has come of it. I shall try something else, but it is all very problematic. I have to think about a literary income. I don’t want that side of our affairs to be Volodya’s worry alone. He works a lot as it is. The question of an income troubles him greatly.
This is what I wanted to ask you about. Lately I have been putting in a lot of study on education in general and the history of education in particular, so I am well equipped in this field. I have even written a whole pamphlet, “The Elementary School and Democracy”. The first part of it is ready and is called “The Role of Productive Labour in Public Education”. A hundred odd pages. I think it has turned out quite interesting. I should like to ask you to find me a publisher. I can send the manuscript by return of post if asked for, Perhaps S vobodnoye Vospitaniye or some other publisher would take it. By the way, I have sent an article on Rousseau to Svobodnoye Vospitanlyc. They must have received the letter because they have begun sending me the journal, but I don’t know whether they have received the manuscript. Can you find out whether they got the article and whether it will be published? I shall soon be sending them something on other, more topical subjects.
I asked Rakhil’s brother[L. S. Rivlin.—Editor.] to go to Svobodnoye Vospitaniye, but he has quite a few affairs of his own to look after and is not a very suitable person for such negotiations.
It is a pity, too, that business with the Granats went wrong. Volodya wrote to them in summer[Collected Works, Volume 36, page 317.—Editor.] but got no answer, and so I don’t know whether they left a place for my article "Labour School
what size it should be and by what date it had to be submitted. I am now busy working on the question of apprenticeship. The libraries in Switzerland are, in general, well equipped and work goes well. I also have plenty of time, but the real problem is to find whom to write for. It is difficult to arrange anything from here. Do what you can.
Do you know what has happened to Lidya? I have had no news of her since summer. Is she well? How is she doing?
I write to our people from time to time, although there is nothing much to write about.
I send you many kisses, dear Manyasha, drop me a couple of lines some time. Keep well!

Nadya
Do you ever see Zinaida Pavlovna? Has she completely recovered from the operation? Where are they? What are they doing?

Dear Manyasha,
Thanks for inquiring about the Gorbunovs,[ I. I. and Y. Y. Gorbunov-Posadov.—Editor.] they really did write. I have begun to receive their journal again and I see that it has been considerably reduced in size. On Volodya’s advicel sent the pamphlet to Petrograd. Volodya wrote to the publisher about it.[Collected Works, Vol. 36, p. 367.—Editor.] Anya wrote that we may also try Bench or the Popovs. The postcard you sent in spring about the Granats was received. Volcdya wrote to you and to the Granats but got no answer. Perhaps you will ask them the date by which it must be sent and what length it should be. Write more often to Volodya, he is always anxious to receive your letters and you have now started writing very occasionally. It is true that it is somehow difficult to write. Do you know anything about Lidya, I have had no news of her since spring, although i have written to her. Many kisses. Volodya was very pleased to receive your long letter. Perhaps you will write again some time.
All the best,
Nadya
The newspapers and books have arrived. Volodya wrote to you when he received them.
