Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 5
Preface by Progress
      Publishers


    
    Volume Five contains Lenin's works written between May 1901 and
    February 1902. These include articles and notes published in
    Iskra: “Where To Begin”, “Another
    Massacre”, “A Valuable Admission”,
    “The Lessons of the Crisis”, “The Serf-Owners at

    of building the Party and of the class struggle of the proletariat.
  

    In the article “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the
    Hannibals of Liberalism”, published in Zarya in
    December 1901, Lenin elaborates the tactics of the Marxist party of
    the proletariat in relation to the liberal bourgeoisie.
  

    "The Agrarian Question and the 'Critics of Marx'" expounds and
    develops the Marxist theory of the agrarian question and is a
    critique of the Russian and international revisionists.
  

    This volume also contains Lenin's What Is To Be Done? the
    theoretical premises of which laid the foundations of the ideology
    of the Bolshevik Party.
  

    Seven of the works of Lenin to be found in this volume are included
    in the Collected Works for the first time. Of these, three
    are notes published in Iskra: “A Zemstvo
    Congress”, “On a Letter from 'Southern Workers'", and
    “Reply to 'A Reader'". The other four documents are:

    “The Journal Svoboda”, “On the
    Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Revolutionary Activity of
    G. V. Plekhanov”, and “Anarchism and
    Socialism”. These four items appeared in print only after the
    October Revolution.

    In recent years the question of âwhat is to be doneâ
    has confronted Russian Social-Democrats

      with particular insistence.  It is not a question of what path
      we must choose (as was the case in the late eighties and early
      nineties), but of what practical steps we must take upon the
      known path and how they shall be taken.  It is a question of a
      system and plan of practical work. And it must be admitted that
      we have not yet solved this question of the character and the
      methods of struggle, fundamental for a party of practical
      activity, that it still gives rise to serious differences of
      opinion which reveal a deplorable ideological instability and
      vacillation.  On the one hand, the

      âEconomistâ

      trend, far from being dead, is endeavouring to clip and narrow
      the work of political organisation and agitation.  On the other,
      unprincipled eclecticism is again rearing its head, aping every
      new âtrendâ, and is incapable of distinguishing
      immediate demands from the main tasks and permanent needs of the
      movement as a whole.  This trend, as we know, has ensconced
      itself in

      Rabocheye Dyelo.[3]

      This journal’s latest statement of
      âprogrammeâ, a bombastic article under the bombastic
      title âA Historic Turnâ
      (âListokâ

      Rabochevo Dyela,
      No. 6[4]),

      bears out with special emphasis the characterisation we have
      given.  Only yesterday there was a flirtation with
      âEconomismâ, a fury over the resolute condemnation
      of

      Rabochaya Mysl,[5]

      and
      Plekhanov’s

      presentation of the question of the struggle against autocracy
      was being toned down.  But today
      Liebknecht’s

      words are being quoted: âIf the circumstances change
      within twenty-four hours, then tactics must be changed within
      twenty-four hours.â There is talk of a âstrong
      fighting organisation for direct attack, for storming, the
      autocracy; of âbroad revolutionary political agitation
      among the massesâ (how energetic we are now—both
      revolutionary and

    

political!); of âceaseless calls for
      street protestsâ; of âstreet demonstrations of a
      pronounced [sic!] political
      characterâ; and so on, and so forth.

    
      We might perhaps declare ourselves happy at Rabocheye
      Dyelo’s quick grasp of the programme we put
      forward in the first issue of

      Iskra,[6]

      calling for the formation of a strong well-organised party, whose
      aim is not only to win isolated concessions but to storm the
      fortress of the autocracy itself; but the lack of any set point
      of view in these individuals can only dampen our happiness.
     Rabocheye Dyelo, of course, mentions
      Liebknecht’s name in vain.  The tactics of agitation in
      relation to some special question, or the tactics with regard to
      some detail of party organisation may be changed in twenty-four
      hours; but only people devoid of all principle are capable of
      changing, in twenty-four hours, or, for that matter, in
      twenty-four months, their view on the necessity—in
      general, constantly, and absolutely—of an organisation of
      struggle and of political agitation among the masses. It is
      ridiculous to plead different circumstances and a change of
      periods: the building of a fighting organisation and the conduct
      of political agitation are essential under any âdrab,
      peacefulâ circumstances, in any period, no matter how
      marked by a âdeclining revolutionary spiritâ;
      moreover, it is precisely in such periods and under such
      circumstances that work of this kind is particularly necessary,
      since it is too late to form the organisation in times of
      explosion and outbursts; the party must be in a state of
      readiness to launch activity at a moment’s
      notice. âChange the tactics within twenty-four
      hoursâ! But in order to change tactics it is first
      necessary to have tactics; without a strong organisation skilled
      in waging political struggle under all circumstances and at all
      times, there can be no question of that systematic plan of
      action, illumined by firm principles and steadfastly carried
      out, which alone is worthy of the name of tactics. Let us,
      indeed, consider the matter; we are now being told that the
      âhistoric momentâ has presented our Party with a
      âcompletely newâ question—the question of
      terror. Yesterday the âcompletely newâ question was
      political organisation and agitation; today it is terror. Is it
      not strange to hear people who have so grossly forgotten their
      principles holding forth on a radical change in tactics?
    
 

      Fortunately, Rabocheye Dyelo is in
      error. The question of terror is not a new question at all; it
      will suffice to recall briefly the established views of Russian
      Social-Democracy on the subject.
    
      In principle we have never rejected, and cannot reject,
      terror. Terror is one of the forms of military action that may
      be perfectly suitable and even essential at a definite juncture
      in the battle, given a definite state of the troops and the
      existence of definite conditions.  But the important point is
      that terror, at the present time, is by no means suggested as an
      operation for the army in the field, an operation closely
      connected with and integrated into the entire system of
      struggle, but as an independent form of occasional attack
      unrelated to any army.  Without a central body and with the
      weakness of local revolutionary organisations, this, in fact, is
      all that terror can be. We, therefore, declare emphatically that
      under the present conditions such a means of struggle is
      inopportune and unsuitable; that it diverts the most active
      fighters from their real task, the task which is most important
      from the standpoint of the interests of the movement as a whole;
      and that it disorganises the forces, not of the government, but
      of the revolution. We need but recall the recent events. With
      our own eyes we saw that the mass of workers and âcommon
      peopleâ of the towns pressed forward in struggle, while
      the revolutionaries lacked a staff of leaders and
      organisers. Under such conditions, is there not the danger that,
      as the most energetic revolutionaries go over to terror, the
      fighting contingents, in whom alone it is possible to place
      serious reliance, will be weakened? Is there not the danger of
      rupturing the contact between the revolutionary organisations
      and the disunited masses of the discontented, the protesting,
      and the disposed to struggle, who are weak precisely because
      they are disunited? Yet it is this contact that is the sole
      guarantee of our success. Far be it from us to deny the
      significance of heroic individual blows, but it is our duty to
      sound a vigorous warning against becoming infatuated with
      terror, against taking it to be the chief and basic means of
      struggle, as so many people strongly incline to do at
      present. Terror can never be a regular military operation; at
      best it can only serve as one of the methods employed in a
      decisive assault. But can we issue the call
      for such

    

a decisive assault at the present moment?
      Rabocheye Dyelo apparently thinks we
      can. At any rate, it exclaims: âForm assault
      columns!â But this, again, is more zeal than reason. The
      main body of our military forces consists of volunteers and
      insurgents. We possess only a few small units of regular troops,
      and these are not even mobilised; they are not connected with
      one another, nor have they been trained to form columns of any
      sort, let alone assault columns. In view of all this, it must be
      clear to anyone who is capable of appreciating the general
      conditions of our struggle and who is mindful of them at every
      âturnâ in the historical course of events that at
      the present moment our slogan cannot be âTo the
      assaultâ, but has to be, âLay siege to the enemy
      fortressâ. In other words, the immediate task of our Party
      is not to summon all available forces for the attack right now,
      but to call for the formation of a revolutionary organisation
      capable of uniting all forces and guiding the movement in actual
      practice and not in name alone, that is, an organisation ready
      at any time to support every protest and every outbreak and use
      it to build up and consolidate the fighting forces suitable for
      the decisive struggle.
    
      The lesson of the

      February and March events[7]

      has been so impressive that no disagreement in principle with
      this conclusion is now likely to be encountered. What we need at
      the present moment, however, is not a solution of the problem in
      principle but a practical solution. We should not only be clear
      on the nature of the organisation that is needed and its precise
      purpose, but we must elaborate a definite
      plan for an organisation, so that its
      formation may be undertaken from all aspects. In view of the
      pressing importance of the question, we, on our part, take the
      liberty of submitting to the comrades a skeleton plan to be
      developed in greater detail in

      a pamphlet now in preparation for print.[8]

      In our opinion, the starting-point of our activities, the first
      step towards creating the desired organisation, or, let us say,
      the main thread which, if followed, would enable us steadily to
      develop, deepen, and extend that organisation, should be the
      founding of an All-Russian political newspaper. A newspaper is
      what we most of all need; without it we cannot conduct that
      systematic, all-round propaganda and agitation, consistent in
      principle, which is the chief and permanent task of
      Social-Democracy in general and, in particular, the pressing
      task of the moment, when interest in politics and in questions
      of socialism has been aroused among the broadest strata of the
      population. Never has the need been felt so acutely as today for
      reinforcing dispersed agitation in the form of individual
      action, local leaflets, pamphlets, etc., by means of generalised
      and systematic agitation that can only be conducted with the aid
      of the periodical press. It may be said without exaggeration
      that the frequency and regularity with which a newspaper is
      printed (and distributed) can serve as a precise criterion of
      how well this cardinal and most essential sector of our militant
      activities is built up. Furthermore, our newspaper must be
      All-Russian. If we fail, and as long as we fail, to combine our
      efforts to influence the people and the government by means of
      the printed word, it will be utopian to think of combining other
      means, more complex, more difficult, but also more decisive, for
      exerting influence. Our movement suffers in the first place,
      ideologically, as well as in practical and organisational
      respects, from its state of fragmentation, from the almost
      complete immersion of the overwhelming majority of
      Social-Democrats in local work, which narrows their outlook, the
      scope of their activities, and their skill in the maintenance of
      secrecy and their preparedness. It is precisely in this state of
      fragmentation that one must look for the deepest roots of the
      instability and the waverings noted above. The
      first step towards eliminating this
      short-coming, towards transforming divers local movements into a
      single, All-Russian movement, must be the founding of an
      All-Russian newspaper. Lastly, what we need is definitely a
      political newspaper. Without a political
      organ, a political movement deserving that name is inconceivable
      in the Europe of today. Without such a newspaper we cannot
      possibly fulfill our task—that of concentrating all the
      elements of political discontent and protest, of vitalising
      thereby the revolutionary movement of the proletariat. We have
      taken the first step, we have aroused in the working class a
      passion for âeconomicâ, factory exposures; we must
      now take the next step, that of arousing in every section of the
      population that is at all politically conscious a passion for
      political exposure. We must not be
      discouraged by the fact that the voice of political exposure is
      today so feeble, timid, and infrequent. This is not because of a
      wholesale submission to police despotism, but because those who
      are able and ready to make exposures have no tribune from which
      to speak, no eager and encouraging audience, they do not see
      anywhere among the people that force to which it would be worth
      while directing their complaint against the
      âomnipotentâ Russian Government. But today all this
      is rapidly changing. There is such a force—it is the
      revolutionary proletariat, which has demonstrated its readiness,
      not only to listen to and support the summons to political
      struggle, but boldly to engage in battle. We are now in a
      position to provide a tribune for the nationwide exposure of the
      tsarist government, and it is our duty to do this. That tribune
      must be a Social-Democratic newspaper. The Russian working
      class, as distinct from the other classes and strata of Russian
      society, displays a constant interest in political knowledge and
      manifests a constant and extensive demand (not only in periods
      of intensive unrest) for illegal literature. When such a mass
      demand is evident, when the training of experienced
      revolutionary leaders has already begun, and when the
      concentration of the working class makes it virtual master in
      the working-class districts of the big cities and in the factory
      settlements and communities, it is quite feasible for the
      proletariat to found a political newspaper. Through the
      proletariat the newspaper will reach the urban petty
      bourgeoisie, the rural handicraftsmen, and the peasants, thereby
      becoming a real people’s political newspaper.
    
     The role of a newspaper, however, is not limited solely to the
      dissemination of ideas, to political education, and to the
      enlistment of political allies. A newspaper is not only a
      collective propagandist and a collective agitator, it is also a
      collective organiser. In this last respect it may be likened to
      the scaffolding round a building under construction, which marks
      the contours of the structure and facilitates communication
      between the builders, enabling them to distribute the work and
      to view the common results achieved by their organised
      labour. With the aid of the newspaper, and through it, a
      permanent organisation will naturally take shape that will
      engage, not only in local activities, but in regular general
      work, and will train its members to follow

 

political events
      carefully, appraise their significance and their effect on the
      various strata of the population, and develop effective means
      for the revolutionary party to influence these events. The mere
      technical task of regularly supplying the newspaper with copy
      and of promoting regular distribution will necessitate a network
      of local agents of the united party, who will maintain constant
      contact with one another, know the general state of affairs, get
      accustomed to performing regularly their detailed functions in
      the All-Russian work, and test their strength in the
      organisation of various revolutionary actions. This network of

      agents[1]

      will form the skeleton of precisely the kind of organisation we
      need—one that is sufficiently large to embrace the whole
      country; sufficiently broad and many-sided to effect a strict
      and detailed division of labour; sufficiently well tempered to
      be able to conduct steadily its own work
      under any circumstances, at all âsudden turnsâ, and
      in face of all contingencies; sufficiently flexible to be able,
      on the one hand, to avoid an open battle against an overwhelming
      enemy, when the enemy has concentrated all his forces at one
      spot, and yet, on the other, to take advantage of his
      unwieldiness and to attack him when and where he least expects
      it. Today we are faced with the relatively easy task of
      supporting student demonstrations in the streets of big cities;
      tomorrow we may, perhaps, have the more difficult task of
      supporting, for example, the unemployed movement in some
      particular area, and the day after to be at our posts in order
      to play a revolutionary part in a peasant uprising. Today we
      must take advantage of the tense political situation arising out
      of the government’s campaign against the Zemstvo; tomorrow
      we may have to support popular indignation against some tsarist
      bashi-bazouk on the rampage and help, by means of boycott,
      indictment, demonstrations, etc., to make things so hot for him
      as to force him into open retreat. Such a degree of combat
      readiness can be developed only through the constant activity of
      regular troops. If we join forces to produce a common newspaper,
      this work will train and bring into the foreground, not only the
      most skillful propagandists, but the most capable organisers, the
      most talented political party leaders capable, at the right
      moment, of releasing the slogan for the decisive struggle and of
      taking the lead in that struggle.
    
      In   conclusion, a few words to avoid possible
      misunderstanding. We have spoken continuously of systematic,
      planned preparation, yet it is by no means our intention to
      imply that the autocracy can be overthrown only by a regular
      siege or by organised assault. Such a view would be absurd and
      doctrinaire. On the contrary, it is quite possible, and
      historically much more probable, that the autocracy will
      collapse under the impact of one of the spontaneous outbursts or
      unforeseen political complications which constantly threaten it
      from all sides. But no political party that wishes to avoid
      adventurous gambles can base its activities on the anticipation
      of such outbursts and complications. We must go our own way, and
      we must steadfastly carry on our regular work, and the less our
      reliance on the unexpected, the less the chance of our being
      caught unawares by any âhistoric turnsâ.
    

 
Notes

  It will be understood, of course, that these agents could
  work successfully only in the closest contact with the local
  committees (groups, study circles) of our Party. In general,
  the entire plan we project can, of course, be implemented
  only with the most active support of the committees which
  have on repeated occasions attempted to unite the Party and
  which, we are sure, will achieve this unification—if
  not today, then tomorrow, if not in one way, then in
  another.
—Lenin

âWhere To Beginâ was published in Iskra and reissued by local Social-Democratic organisations as a separate pamphlet. The Siberian Social-Democratic League printed 5,000 copies of the pamphlet and distributed it throughout Siberia. The pamphlet was also distributed in Samara, Tambov, Nizhni-Novgorod, and
 other Russian cities.

Rabocheye Dyelo (The Workers’ Cause)—a journal with
âEconomistâ views, organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
Abroad. It appeared irregularly and was published in Geneva from April 1899 to
February 1902 under the editorship of B. N. Krichevsky,
A. S. Martynov, and V. P. Ivanshin. Altogether 12 numbers appeared in nine
issues.


Lenin criticised the views of the Rabocheye Dyelo group in
his What Is To Be Done? (see present volume, pp. 347-529).



[4]

âListokâ Rabochevo Dyela (Rabocheye Dyelo
Supplement)—of which eight numbers were issued in Geneva, at
irregular intervals, between June 1900 and July 1901.



[5]

 Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought)—an
âEconomistâ
newspaper, organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, published
from October 1897 to December 1902. Altogether 16 issues appeared: numbers 3 to
11 and number 16 were published in Berlin, the remaining numbers in
St. Petersburg. It was edited by
K. M. Takhtarev and others.


Lenin characterised the paper’s views as a Russian variety of international
opportunism arid criticised them in a number of his articles published in
Iskra and in other works including
What Is To Be Done?


[6]

The reference is to the article âThe Urgent Tasks of Our Movementâ,
which was published as the leading article in Iskra, No. 1, December
1900 (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 366-71).


Iskra (The Spark)—the first All-Russian illegal
Marxist news
paper, founded by Lenin in 1900. The foundation of a militant organ of
revolutionary Marxism was the main task confronting Russian Social-Democrats at
the time.


Since the publication of a revolutionary newspaper in Russia
was impossible, owing to police persecution, Lenin, while still
in exile in Siberia, worked out all the details of a plan to publish

 

the paper abroad. When his term of exile ended in January 1900, be
immediately began to put his plan into effect. In February, he conducted
negotiations with Vera Zasulich, who had come illegally to St. Petersburg
from abroad, on the participation of the Emancipation of Labour group in
the publication of an All-Russian Marxist newspaper. The so-called Pskov
Conference was held in April, with V. I. Lenin, L. Martov
(Y. 0. Tsederbaum), A. N. Potresov, S. I. Radchenko, and the âlegal
Marxistsâ (P. B. Struve and M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky)
participating. The conference heard and discussed Lenin’s draft editorial
declaration on the programme and the aims of the All-Russian newspaper
(Iskra) and the scientific and political magazine
(Zarya). Lenin visited a number of Russian
cities—St. Petersburg, Riga, Pskov, Nizhni Novgorod, Ufa, and
Samara—establishing contact with Social- Democratic groups and
individual Social-Democrats and obtaining their support for Iskra.
In August, when Lenin arrived in Switzerland, he and Potresov held a
conference with the Emancipation of Labour group on the programme and the
aims of the newspaper and the magazine, on possible contributors, on the
composition of Editorial Board, and on the problem of residence. For an
account of the founding of Iskra see the article âHow the
’Spark’ was Nearly Extinguishedâ (see present edition, Vol. 4,
pp. 333-49).



The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra was published in Leipzig in December
1900; the ensuing issues were published in Munich; from July 1902 it was
published in London; and from the spring of 1903 in Geneva.


The Editorial Board consisted of V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov, L. Martov,
P. B. Axelrod, A. N. Potresov, and V. I. Zasulich. The first secretary of the
Editorial Board was I. G. Smidovich-Leman. From the spring of 1901 the post was
taken over by N. K. Krupskaya, who was also in charge of all correspondence
between Iskra and Russian Social-Democratic organisations. Lenin was
actually Editor-in-Chief and the leading figure in Iskra. He published
his articles on all important questions of Party organisation and the class
struggle of the proletariat in Russia and dealt with the most important events
in world affairs.


Iskra became, as Lenin had planned, a rallying centre for the Party
forces, a centre for the training of leading Party workers. In a number of
Russian cities (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Samara, and others) groups and
committees of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
(P1.S.D.L.P.) were organised along Lenin’s Iskra
line. Iskra organisations sprang up and worked under the direct
leadership of Lenin’s disciples and comrades-in-arms: =

N. E. Bauman, I. V. Babusbkin, S. I. Gusev, M. I. Kalinin, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky,
and others. The newspaper played a decisive role in the struggle for the Marxist
Party, in the defeat of the âEconomistsâ, and in the unification of
the dispersed Social-Democratic study circles.


On the initiative and with the direct participation of Lenin, the Editorial
Board drew up a draft programme of the Party

   

(published in Iskra, No. 21) and prepared the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., which was held in July and August 1903. By the time the Congress was
convened the majority of the local Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had
joined forces with Iskra, approved its programme, organisational plan,
and tactical line, and accepted it as their leading organ. By a special
resolution, which rioted the exceptional role played by Iskra in the
struggle to build the Party, the Congress adopted the news paper as the central
organ of the R.S.D.L.P. and approved an editorial board consisting of Lenin,
Plekhanov, and Martov. Despite the decision of the Congress, Martov refused to
participate, and Nos. 46 to 51 were edited by Lenin and Plekhanov. Later Plekhanov went over to the Menshevik position and demanded that, all the old
Menshevik editors, notwithstanding their rejection by the Congress, be placed on
the Editorial Board. Lenin could not agree to this, and on October 19 (November
1, new style), 1903, he left the Iskra Editorial Board to strengthen
his position in the Central Committee and from there to conduct a struggle
against the Menshevik opportunists. Issue No. 52 of Iskra was edited by
Plekhanov alone. On November 13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov, on his own initiative and
in violation of the will of the Congress, co-opted all the old Menshevik editors
on to the Editorial Board. Beginning with issue No. 52, the Mensheviks turned
Iskra into
their own, opportunist, organ.

This passage refers to the mass revolutionary actions of students and
workers— political demonstrations, meetings, strikes—that took place
in February and March 1901, in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, Kazan,
Yaroslavl, Warsaw, Belostok, Tomsk, Odessa, and other cities in Russia.


The student movement of 1900-01, which began with academic demands, acquired
the character of revolutionary action against the reactionary policy of the
autocracy; it was supported by the advanced workers and it met with a response
among all strata of Russian society. The direct cause of the demonstrations and
strikes in February and March 1901, was the drafting of 183 Kiev University
students into the army as a punitive act for their participation in a students’
meeting (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 414-19). The government launched a
furious attack on participants in the revolutionary actions; the police and the
Cossacks dispersed demonstrations and assaulted the participants; hundreds of
students were arrested and expelled from colleges and universities. On March 4
(17), 1901, the demonstration in the square in front of the Kazan Cathedral, in
St. Petersburg, was dispersed with particular brutality. The February-March
events were evidence of the revolutionary upsurge in Russia; the participation
of workers in the movement under political slogans was of tremendous
importance.

      It seems that we are now passing through a period in which our
      working-class movement is once more about to engage with irresistible
      force in the sharp conflicts that terrify the government and the
      propertied classes and bring joy and encouragement to socialists. Yes, we
      rejoice in these conflicts and are encouraged by them, notwithstanding the
      tremendous number of victims claimed by military reprisals, because the
      working class is proving by its resistance that it is not reconciled to
      its position, that it refuses to remain in slavery or to submit meekly to
      violence and tyranny. Even with the most peaceful course of events, the
      present system always and inevitably exacts countless sacrifices from the
      working class. Thousands and tens of thousands of men and women, who toil
      all their lives to create wealth for others, perish from starvation and
      constant malnutrition, die prematurely from diseases caused by horrible
      working conditions, by wretched housing and overwork. He is a hundred
      times a hero who prefers to die fighting in open struggle against the
      defenders and protectors of this infamous system rather than die the
      lingering death of a crushed, broken-down, and submissive nag. We do not
      by any means want to imply that scuffling with the police is the best form
      of struggle. On the contrary, we have always told the workers that it is
      in their interests to carry on the struggle in a more calm and restrained
      manner, and to try to make use of all discontent for support to the
      organised struggle of the revolutionary party. But the principal source
      that sustains revolutionary Social-Democracy is the spirit of protest
      among the working class which, in view of the violence and oppression
      surrounding the workers, is bound to manifest itself from time to time in
      the form

    

      of desperate outbursts. These outbursts arouse to conscious life the
      widest sections of the workers, oppressed by poverty and ignorance, and
      stimulate in them a noble hatred for the oppressors and enemies of
      liberty. That is why the news of massacres such as that which took place
      at the Obukhov Works on May 7, makes us exclaim: “The workers’
      revolt has been suppressed; long live the revolt of the workers!”
    

      There was a time, and not very long ago at that, when workers’ revolts
      were a rare exception, called forth only by some special
      circumstances. Now things have changed. A few years ago industry was
      flourishing, trade was brisk, and the demand for workers was
      great. Nevertheless, the workers organised a number of strikes to improve
      their working conditions; they realised that they must not let the moment
      slip by, that they must take advantage of the time when the employers were
      making particularly high profits and it would he easier to win concessions
      from them. The boom, however, has given way to a crisis. The manufacturers
      cannot sell their goods, profits have declined, bankruptcies have
      increased, factories are cutting production, and workers are being
      discharged and turned into the streets in masses without a crust of
      bread. The workers now have to fight desperately, not to improve their
      conditions, but to maintain the old standards and to reduce the losses the
      employers impose on them. And so the working-class movement develops in
      depth and extent:

      at first, struggle in exceptional and isolated cases; then, unceasing and
      stubborn battles during industrial prosperity and the trade boom; finally,
      similar unceasing and stubborn struggle in the period of crisis. We may
      now say that the working-class movement has become a permanent feature of
      our life and that it will grow whatever the conditions.
      

      The change-over from boom to crisis will not only teach our workers that
      united struggle is a permanent necessity, it will also destroy  the
      harmful illusions that began to take shape at the time of industrial
      prosperity. By means of strikes, the workers were able in some places to
      force concessions from the employers with comparative ease, and this
      “economic” struggle assumed an exaggerated significance; it
      was forgotten that trade unions and strikes can, at best, only win
      slightly better terms for the sale of labour-power as a commodity  Trade
      unions and strikes cannot help in

    

      times of crisis when there is no demand for this
      “commodity”, they cannot change the conditions which,
      convert labour-power into a commodity and which doom the masses of
      working people to dire need and unemployment. To change these
      conditions, a revolutionary struggle against the whole existing social
      and political system is necessary; the industrial crisis will convince
      very many workers of the justice of this statement.
    

      Let us return to the massacre of May 7. We give below avail able
      information on the May strikes and manifestations of unrest among the
      St. Petersburg

      workers.[2]
      We shall also examine the police
report of the massacre. Lately we have learned to understand the
significance of government (and police) reports of strikes,
demonstrations, and clashes with the troops; we have gathered sufficient
material to judge the reliability of these reports—the smoke of
police false hoods may sometimes give a clue to the fire of popular
indignation.
      

“On May 7,” says the official report, “about two hundred
workers employed in various departments of the Obukhov Steel Works in
the village of Alexandrovskoye on the Schlüsselburg Highway stopped
work after the dinner break, and in the course of their interview with
Lieutenant-Colonel Ivanov, assistant to the director of the works, put
forward a number of groundless demands.”
      

If the workers stopped work without giving two weeks’ notice (assuming
the stoppage was not due to lawless acts all too frequently committed by
the employers), even according to Russian law (which of late has been
systematically enlarged and sharpened against the workers), they have
merely committed a common offence for which they are liable to
prosecution in a magistrate’s court. But the Russian Government is
making itself more and more ridiculous by its severity. On the one hand,
laws are passed designating new crimes (e.g., wilful refusal to work or
participation in a mob that damages property or resists armed force),
penal ties for striking are increased, etc., while on the other, the
physical and political possibility of applying these laws and imposing
corresponding penalties is disappearing. It is physically impossible to
prosecute thousands and tens of thousands of men for refusing to work,
for striking, or for

    

      “mobs”. It is politically impossible to try each case of this
      sort, for no matter how the judges are selected and no matter how
      publicity is emasculated, there still remains at least the shadow of a
      trial, naturally a “trial” of the government and not of the
      workers. Thus, criminal laws passed for the definite purpose of
      facilitating the government’s political struggle against the
      proletariat (and at the same time of concealing the political character of
      the struggle by “state” arguments about “public
      order”, etc.) are steadily forced into the background. by
      direct political struggle and open street
      clashes. “Justice” throws off the mask of majesty and
      impartiality, and takes to flight, leaving the field to the police, the
      gendarmes, and the Cossacks, who are greeted with stones.
    

      Let us take the government’s reference to the “demands” of the
      workers. From a legal standpoint stoppage of work is a misdemeanour,
      irrespective of the workers’ demands. But the government has lost its
      chance of basing itself on the law it recently issued, and it tries to
      justify its reprisals carried out with “the means at its
      disposal” by declaring the workers’ demands to be without basis. Who
      were the judges in this affair?  Lieutenant-Colonel Ivanov, assistant to
      the director of the works, the very authority against whom the workers
      were complaining! It is not surprising, therefore, that the workers reply
      to such explanations by the powers that be with a hail of stones.
    

      And so, when the workers poured into the street and held up horse trains a
      real battle began. Apparently the workers fought with all their might,
      for, although armed only with stones, they managed twice to beat
      off the attacks by police, gendarmes, mounted guards, and the armed
      factory

      guard.[1]

      It is true, if police reports are to be believed,
      “several shots” were fired from the crowd, but no one was
      injured by them. Stones, however, fell “like hail”,
      and the workers not only

    

      put up a stubborn resistance, they displayed resourcefulness and ability
      in adapting themselves immediately to the situation and in selecting the
      best form of struggle. They occupied the neighbouring courtyards and
      from over the fences poured a hail of stones on the tsar’s
      bashi-bazouks, so that even after three volleys had been fired,
      killing one man (only one?) and wounding eight (?) (one of whom died the
      following day), even after this, although the crowd had fled, the fight
      still continued and some companies of the Omsk Infantry Regiment had to be
      called out to “clear the workers out of the neighbouring
      courtyards”.
    

      The government emerged victorious, but such victories will bring nearer
      its ultimate defeat. Every clash with the people will increase the number
      of indignant workers who are ready to fight, and will bring into the
      foreground more experienced, better armed, and bolder leaders. We have
      already discussed the plan of action these leaders should follow. We have
      repeatedly pointed to the imperative necessity for a sound revolutionary
      organisation. But in connection with the events of May 7, we must not lose
      sight of the following:
    

      Much has been said recently about the impossibility and the hopelessness
      of street fighting against modern troops. Particularly insistent on this
      have been the wise “Critics” who have dragged out the old
      lumber of bourgeois science in the guise of new, impartial, scientific
      conclusions, and have distorted Engels’ words that refer, with
      reservations, only to a temporary tactic of the German

      Social-Democrats.[3]

      But we see from the example of even this one
      clash how absurd these arguments are. Street fighting is possible; it is
      not the position of the fighters, but the position of the government that
      is hopeless if it has to deal with larger numbers than those employed in a
      single factory. In the May 7 fighting the workers had nothing but stones,
      and, of course, the mere prohibition of the city mayor will not prevent
      them from securing other weapons next time. The workers were unprepared
      and numbered only three and a half thousand; nevertheless, they repelled
      the attack of several hundred mounted guards, gendarmes, city police, and
      infantry. Did the police find it easy to storm the one house,
      No. 63, Schlüsselburg

      Highway?[4]

      Ask yourselves—will it be easy
      to

    

      “clear the workers” out of whole blocks, not merely
      out of one or two courtyards, in the St. Petersburg working-class
      districts? When the time of decisive battle comes, will it not be
      necessary to “clear” the houses and courtyards of the
      capital, not only of workers, but of all who have not forgot ten the
      infamous massacre of
March 4,[5]

      who have not become reconciled to the
      police government, but are only terrified by it and not yet confident of
      their own strength?
    

      Comrades! Do your best to collect the names of those killed and wounded on
      May 7. Let all workers in the capital honour their memory and prepare for
      a new and decisive struggle against the police government for the people’s
      liberty!
    

 
Notes
 

[1]

      Note this! The government communication states that “the armed
      factory guard” “were already standing by in the factory
      yard”, whereas the gendarmes, mounted guards, and the city police
      were called out later. Since when, and why, was an armed guard
      maintained in readiness in the factory yard? Since the First of
      May? Did they expect a workers’ demonstration? That we do not know; but it
      is clear that the government is deliberately concealing facts that would
      explain the mounting discontent and indignation of the workers.
    —Lenin
 



[2]

      Lenin refers to a contribution to Iskra, No. 5 (June 1901),
      entitled “The First of May in Russia”, which was published in
      the section “Chronicle of the Working-Class Movement and Letters
      from Factories”.
    



[3]

      Lenin refers to Frederick Engels’ Introduction to Karl Marx’s work The
      Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850; the 1895 edition of the
      Introduction was distorted by the German Social- Democrats and construed
      by them to mean a rejection of armed uprising and barricade fighting.
    

      The full text of the Introduction was first published according to Engels’
      manuscript in the U.S.S.R. (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works,
      Vol. I, Moscow, 1958, pp. 118-38). p. 29
    



[4]

      Lenin refers here to the clash between the police and the striking workers
      of the Maxwell factory in St. Petersburg in December 1898. For several
      hours the police (200 on foot and 100 mounted police), who had arrived to
      arrest the “ringleaders” of the strike, could not penetrate
      into the workers’ barracks. The workers, who had barricaded themselves,
      fought against the police with logs, with bottles, and with boiling water
      which they poured on the police.
    



[5]

      Lenin refers here to the brutality of the tsarist police and Cossacks in
      dispersing a demonstration in Kazan Square, St. Peters burg, on March 4
      (17), 1901. Thousands of students and workers took part in this protest
      demonstration against the drafting of students into the army. The tsarist
      government used armed force to disperse the demonstration. The
      demonstrators were brutally beaten, several were killed and many
      crippled. A detailed report of the event was given in Iskra,
      No. 3, in April 1901.

      It has been said of the Russian peasant that he is poorest of all in the
      consciousness of his poverty; of the ordinary Russian subject, it may be
      said that, while he is poor in civil rights, he is poorest of all in the
      consciousness of his lack of rights. Just as the peasant has grown
      accustomed to his wretched poverty, to living his life without pondering
      over the causes of his wretchedness, or the possibility of removing it, so
      the plain Russian subject has become accustomed to the omnipotence of the
      government, to living on without a thought as to whether the government
      can retain its arbitrary power any longer and whether, side by side with
      it, there are not forces undermining the outmoded political system. A
      particularly good “antidote” to this political apathy and
      somnolence is usually contained in the “secret
      documents”[1]

      which reveal that, not only desperate cutthroats and confirmed enemies of
      the government, but also members of the government itself, including
      ministers, and even the tsar, realise the tottering state of the autocracy
      and seek ways and means to improve their position, which they consider
      totally unsatisfactory. One such document is the Memorandum drawn up by
      Witte, who, having quarrelled with the Minister of the Interior,
      Goremykin, over the question of introducing Zemstvo institutions in the
      outlying regions, decided to display his perspicacity and his loyalty to
      the autocracy by drawing up an indictment against the

      Zemstvo.[2]


    

      The charge is levelled against the Zemstvo that it is incompatible with
      autocracy, that by its very nature it is constitutional, that its
      existence inevitably gives rise to friction and conflict between the
      representatives of the public and the government. The indictment is drawn
      up on the basis of vast (relatively) and fairly well prepared material,
      and since it is an indictment concerning a political affair (a rather
      peculiar one at that), we may be sure that it will be read with no less
      interest and will prove no less useful, than were the indictments
      in political trials once published in our newspapers.
    

I

      Let us endeavour to determine whether the assertion that our Zemstvo is
      constitutional is borne out by the facts, and if so, to what extent, and
      in what precise sense.
    

      In this matter, the epoch in which the Zemstvo was introduced is of
      particular importance. The fall of serfdom was a historical event of such
      magnitude that it inevitably made a rent in the police veil concealing
      class antagonisms. The most solidified and best educated class, and the
      one most accustomed to political power—the nobility— displayed
      a very definite desire to restrict the power of the autocracy by means of
      representative institutions. The reference to this fact in Witte’s
      Memorandum is extremely instructive. He says: “Declarations
      concerning the necessity of ’representation for the nobility’ and
      concerning ’the right of the Russian nation to elect its representatives
      to advise the supreme authority’ were made at assemblies of nobles as far
      back as 1859-60.” “Even the word ’constitution’ was

      uttered.”[3]

      “Several

      Gubernia[4]

      Committees

    

      for the Peasant Question and individual members of commit tees called
      before the drafting commissions urged the necessity of drawing the public
      into participation in the administration. ’Deputies are openly striving
      for a constitution,’ wrote Nikitenko in his diary in 1859.”
    


      “When, after the promulgation of the Regulations of February 19,

      1861,[25]
      the hopes entertained in the autocracy were far from realised, and,
      moreover, when the ’redder’ elements in the administration (like
      N. Milyutin) were alienated from the implementation of the Regulations,
      the movement in favour of ’representation’ became more nearly
      unanimous. It found expression in resolutions moved in many assemblies of
      nobles in 1862, and in petitions drawn up by the assemblies in Novgorod,
      Tula, Smolensk, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Tver. The most remarkable of
      these was the Moscow petition, which pleaded for local self-government,
      public trials, obligatory redemption of peasant lands, publication of
      budgets, freedom of the press, and the convening in Moscow of a National
      Duma representing all classes for the purpose of drawing up a complete
      system of reforms. Sharpest were the decisions adopted and the petition
      drawn up by the nobility of Tver on February 2, urging the necessity of
      introducing a number of civil and economic reforms (e.g., equality of
      rights for all social-estates, obligatory redemption of

      peas ant 

      lands) and ’the convocation of
      elected representatives of the whole Russian nation as the only means for
      satisfactorily settling the questions raised, but not settled, in the
      Regulations of February

      19’.[5]


      “Despite the administrative and judicial penalties inflicted on the
      initiators of the Tver

      petition[6]

–continues

      Dragomanov—(not for

    

      the petition directly, but for the sharp motivation attached to the
      collective resignation of the civil

      mediators[26]),

      declarations in the same
      spirit were made at various assemblies of nobles in 1862 and early in
      1863, at which projects for local self-government were also drawn up.
    

      “At this time, a constitutional movement was in progress also among the

      raznochintsi,[27]

      finding expression there in more or less revolutionary secret societies
      and proclamations: Velikoruss (between August and November 1861,
      officers like Obruchev and others took part in its publication),
      Zemskaya Duma (1862), Zemlya i Volya
      (1862-63).... Velikoruss published a draft petition which, as
      many said, was to have been submitted to the tsar during the Thousand
      Years of Russia celebrations in August 1862." The draft petition stated
      inter alia: ’May it please Your Majesty to convene in one of the
      capitals of our Russian fatherland, in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, the
      representatives of the Russian nation in order that they may draw up a
      constitution for

      Russia....”[7]



      If we recall also the proclamation To Young

Russia,[28]

      the numerous arrests and the Draconic punishments inflicted upon the
      “political” criminals (Obruchev, Mikhailov, and others),
      culminating in the frame-up of

      Chernyshevsky[29]

      and his being sentenced illegally to penal servitude, we shall have a
      complete picture of the social situation that gave rise to the Zemstvo
      reform. Witte states only half the truth in his Memorandum when he says
      that “the idea underlying the establishment of Zemstvo institutions
      was undoubtedly a political one”, that governing circles
      “undoubtedly took into consideration” the liberal and
      constitutionalist aspirations of the people. The hidebound official view
      on social phenomena, which the author of the Memorandum reveals
      throughout, is here demonstrated by his ignoring the
      revolutionary movement and by his concealing the Draconic
      measures of repression with which the government protected itself
      against the onset of the revolutionary “party”. True, from our
      modern viewpoint, it seems strange to speak of a revolutionary
      “party” and of its onset at the beginning of the
      sixties. Forty years of historical experience have made us more exacting
      with regard to what may be called revolutionary movements and
      revolutionary onsets. But it must not be forgotten that at that time,
      after thirty years of the rule

    

      of Nicholas I, no one could have foreseen the course of events, no one
      could have estimated the government’s real strength of resistance or the
      real strength of the people’s indignation. Even the most cautious and
      sober politician could not but acknowledge the possibility of a
      revolutionary outbreak and the serious danger of a peasant revolt—in
      the obtaining conditions of the revival of the democratic movement in
      Europe; the ferment in Poland; the discontent in Finland; the demands for
      political reforms made by the entire press and by all the nobility; the
      widespread distribution of Kolokol through out Russia; the
      powerful appeals of Chernyshevsky, who was able, by means even of censored
      articles, to educate genuine revolutionaries; the appearance of
      proclamations; the ferment among the peasants, who were “very

      often”[8]
   

      compelled by armed force and bloodshed to accept the Regulations
      that

    

      stripped them of everything; the refusal of whole groups of civil
      mediators from among the nobility to apply such Regulations, and,
      finally, the student disorders. Under such circumstances, the autocratic
      government, which held it to be its lofty mission to protect, at all
      costs, the omnipotence and irresponsibility of the court camarilla and the
      army of official leeches, on the one hand, and to support the worst
      representatives of the exploiting classes, on the other—such a
      government had no other recourse than ruthlessly to exterminate
      individuals, the conscious and indomitable enemies of tyranny and
      exploitation (i.e., “the ringleaders” of “the
      revolutionary party”), terrify the masses of discontented people, and
      bribe them with small concessions. This meant penal servitude for those
      who preferred to remain silent rather than pour forth stupid or
      hypocritical phrases about the “great emancipation”; reforms
      (innocuous for the autocracy and the exploiting classes) for
      those who waxed enthusiastic over the liberalism of the government and the
      era of progress.
    

      We do not wish to suggest that these calculated reactionary police tactics
      were clearly conceived and systematically pursued by all, or even by a
      few, of the members of the ruling clique. Some of them, on account of
      their narrow-mindedness, may not have pondered on the significance of
      these tactics as a whole and may have been childishly enthusiastic about
      “liberalism”, failing to observe its police mantling.  In
      general, however, there is no doubt that the collective experience and
      collective reasoning of the rulers compelled them to pursue these tactics
      unswervingly. Not in vain did most of the grandees and notables undergo a
      prolonged training in bureaucratic and police methods in the service

    

      of Nicholas I, and were, so to speak, case-hardened by fire and
      water. They remembered how sovereigns had at one time flirted with
      liberalism, and at another acted as the executioners of the

      Radishchevs[30]

      and “let loose” the

      Arakcheyevs[31]

      at their loyal subjects; they remembered December 14,

      1825,[32]

      and they played the role of gendarme of Europe the Russian Government had
      played in

      1848-49.[33]

      The historical experience of autocracy not only compelled the government
      to pursue tactics of intimidation and corruption, but also compelled many
      independent liberals to recommend these tactics to the government. In
      proof of this, we shall quote the opinions of Koshelev and Kavelin. In his
      pamphlet, Constitution, Autocracy, and the National Duma
      (Leipzig, 1862), A. Koshelev expresses opposition to a
      constitution, advocates the convening of a National Advisory Duma, and
      anticipates the following objection:
    


      “To convene a National Duma means to lead Russia towards revolution, i.e.,
      to repeat, in Russia, the États

généraux,[34]

      which were subsequently transformed into the Convention and which came to an end with the
      events of 1792, the proscriptions, the guillotine, the

      noyades,[Mass executions by
drowning.—Ed.]

      etc.”  “No, gentlemen,” replied Koshelev, “it will not be the
      convocation of a National Duma that will prepare the ground for
      revolution, as you understand it. Revolution will come much more surely
      and rapidly as a result of the hesitant and contradictory actions of the
      government, one step forward—one step backward, edicts and laws
      impossible of execution, the restraints placed upon thought and speech; as
      a result of the police (open, and what is worse, secret) surveillance over
      the actions of the social-estates and of private persons, the petty
      persecution of certain individuals, the plunder of the Treasury, the
      squandering of public funds and the lavish granting of rewards, the
      incapacity of statesmen and their alienation from Russia, etc., etc. A
      country just awakening from centuries of oppression can be more surely
      driven to revolution (again as you understand it) by military executions,
      solitary confinement, and banishment; for rankling wounds are incomparably
      more sensitive and painful than fresh wounds. But have no fear, the
      revolution, which, as you suppose, was brought about in France by
      journalists and other writers, will not break out in Russia. Let us also
      hope that no society of desperate hotheads, who choose assassination as a
      means of attaining their ends, will be formed in Russia (although it is
      more difficult to vouch for that). What is more probable and dangerous is
      that, influenced by the split and unobserved by the rural, urban, and
      secret police, an alliance will be established between the peasants and
      the petty-bourgeois townspeople,

    

      which will be joined by young and old, writers and adherents of
      Velikoruss, Young Russia, etc. Such an all-destructive
      alliance, advocating equality, not before, but despite, the law (What
      matchless liberalism! We, of course, are in favour of equality, but not of
      equality despite the law—the law which destroys equality!),
      not the popular, historical village commune, but its morbid progeny, and
      not the rule of reason which certain office-holders fear so much, hut the
      rule of brute force, which these office-holders so readily
      employ—such an alliance 1 say, is far more probable in Russia and
      may be far more powerful than the moderate, well-meaning, and independent
      opposition to the government which our bureaucrats abhor so much and which
      they try so hard to restrict arid suppress. Do not imagine that the party
      of the inner, secret, and anonymous press is small and weak; do not
      imagine that you have plucked it out root and branch. No! By prevent lug
      the youth from completing their education, by treating youthful pranks as
      if they were political crimes, by petty persecution and police
      surveillance you have increased the strength of that party tenfold, and
      have multiplied it and spread it throughout the Empire. What will our
      statesmen resort to in the face of an outbreak resulting from such an
      alliance? Armed force? But will that be absolutely reliable?” (pp. 49-51).
    


      Do not the pompous phrases of this tirade obviously suggest the tactics:
      destroy the “hotheads” and the adherents of the
      “alliance between the peasants and the petty-bourgeois
      townspeople”; satisfy and disunite the “well-meaning and
      moderate opposition” through concessions? But the government proved
      to be cleverer and more agile than the Koshelevs imagined; it conceded
      much less than a National “Advisory” Duma.
    

      And the following from a private letter written by K. D. Kavelin to

      Herzen,[35]

      dated August 6, 1862: "... The news from Russia is not so bad, in my
      opinion. It was not Nicholas Solovyevich that was arrested, but
      Alexander. The arrests do not surprise me and, I confess, do not seem to
      me outrageous. A revolutionary party considers every means to over throw
      the government justified, while the government defends itself by every
      means at its disposal. Arrests and banishment under the reign of the
      despicable Nicholas were quite another thing. People then died for their
      ideas, their convictions, their faith, and their utterances. I would like
      to see you in the government’s boots and see what you would do against a
      party that is secretly and openly working against you. I like
      Chernyshevsky very, very much, but never in my life have I seen such a
      brouillon [an irascible, unsociable

    

      bully, a sower of

      discord],[9]

      such a tactless and cock sure fellow! To perish in vain, for absolutely no
      reason at all! There cannot be the least doubt now that the conflagrations
      have a connection with the

      leaflets.”[10]

      What an example of servile-professorial profundity! It is the
      revolutionaries who are to blame for everything; it is they who are
      conceited enough to hiss at phrase-mongering liberals, they who are so
      impudent as to work secretly and openly against the government and so
      tactless as to get themselves incarcerated in the Fortress of Peter and
      Paul. He, too, the liberal professor, would punish people like these
      “with all the means at his disposal”, were he in power.
    

II

      Thus, the Zemstvo reform was one of the concessions forced from the
      autocratic government by public ferment and revolutionary pressure. We
      have dealt with the character of this pressure in detail in order to
      supplement and correct the picture outlined in the Memorandum by its
      bureaucratic author, who obscured the struggle that had given rise to this
      concession. Nevertheless, the half-hearted and pusillanimous character of
      this concession is quite clearly described in the Memorandum:
    


      “At first, when the Zemstvo reform was just being undertaken, it was no
      doubt intended as a first step toward the introduction of representative

      institutions[11]

;

      but later, when Count Lanskoi and N. A. Milyutin were replaced by Count
      Valuyev, there was an obvious desire, as even the ex-Minister of the
      Interior admits, to act in a spirit of conciliation’, ’softly and
      evasively’. ’The government has no clear

    

      idea of its aims,’ he said at the time. In short, an attempt was
      made— unfortunately made so often by statesmen and always with bad
      results for everyone—to act evasively between two opposite opinions,
      to satisfy liberal aspirations and preserve the existing system.”
    


      The pharisaical word “unfortunately” is highly amusing. A
      minister of the police government describes as casual the tactics which
      the government could not but pursue and did pursue in adopting
      the factory inspection laws, as well as the law on the reduction of the
      working day (June 2, 1897), and which it is now (1901) pursuing in General
      Vannovsky’s flirtation with the

      “public”.[36]



      “On the one hand, it was stated in the explanatory Memorandum
      attached to the regulations governing Zemstvo institutions that the
      purpose of the proposed law was to develop as completely and as
      consistently as possible the principle of local self-government, and that
      ’the Zemstvo administration is merely a special organ of one and the same
      state authority’.... Severnaya Pochta, then the organ of the
      Ministry of the Interior, hinted broadly that the institutions to be
      established were to serve as schools for representative bodies.
    

      “On the other hand, ... the Zemstvo institutions are described in the
      explanatory Memorandum as private and as public institutions, subject to
      the general laws in the same way as individual societies and private
      persons are subject....
    

      “Both the provisions in the Regulations of 1864 and, in particular,
      all the subsequent measures adopted by the Ministry of the Interior in
      relation to the Zemstvo institutions clearly indicate that the
      ’independence of the Zemstvo institutions was seen as a great danger, and
      that the government was afraid to permit the proper development of these
      institutions, being fully aware of what that would lead to. [Our
      italics throughout.] ... There is no doubt that those who had to carry out
      the Zemstvo reform did so merely as a concession to public
      opinion, in order, as the explanatory Memorandum stated, ’to limit
      the unrealisable expectations and radical aspirations which have
      been aroused among the various social-estates in connection with
      the establishment of the Zemstvo institutions’; at the same time, these
      people fully understood it [the reform?]  and strove to prevent the
      proper development of the Zemstvo, to give it a private character,
      restrict its powers, etc. While pacifying the liberals with the promise
      that the first step would not be the last and declaring, or, to be more
      precise, echoing the adherents of the liberal trend, that it was necessary
      to grant the Zemstvo institutions real and independent powers, Count
      Valuyev, in the very act of drafting the Regulations of 1864, strove
      in every way to restrict the powers of those institutions and place them
      under strict administrative guardianship....
    

      “Bereft of a single guiding idea, representing a compromise between two
      opposite trends, the Zemstvo institutions, in the form in which they were
      established by the Regulations of 1864, proved in practice

    

      to be out of accord with the fundamental idea of local self-government on
      which they were based, as well as with the administrative system into
      which they were mechanically inserted and which, moreover, had neither
      been reformed nor adapted to the new conditions of life. The Regulations
      of 181$4 sought to reconcile the irreconcilable and in that way to satisfy
      both the advocates and opponents of Zemstvo self-government. The
      former were offered superficialities and hopes for the future, while in
      order to satisfy the latter the powers of the Zemstvo institutions were
      given an extremely elastic definition.”
    


      What pointed words our ministers sometimes accidentally let drop when they
      desire to put a spoke in the wheel of one of their colleagues and to
      display their profundity, and how useful it would, be for every one of our
      self-complacent Russians and all admirers of the “great”
      reforms to hang on their walls in golden frames the wise police maxims:
      “Pacify the liberals with the promise that the first step will not
      be the last”, “offer” them “superficialities and
      hopes for the future”! It would be particularly useful at the present time
      to refer to these precepts when reading in articles or other items in
      newspapers about General Vannovsky’s “heartfelt solicitude”.
    

      Thus, from the very beginning, the Zemstvo was doomed to serve as a fifth
      wheel to the Wagon of Russian state administration, a wheel
      tolerated by the bureaucracy only insofar as it would not disturb
      its absolute authority, while the role of the representatives of the
      population was restrict ed to the simple technical fulfilment of the
      functions outlined by this very bureaucracy. The Zemstvos had no executive
      organs of their own, they had to act through the police, they had no
      contact with one another, and they were immediately placed under the
      control of the administration. Having made such a harmless concession, the
      government, on .the very day after the establishment of the Zemstvos,
      began systematically to impose restrictions upon them; the almighty
      bureaucratic clique could not reconcile itself to the elected
      representation of the social-estates and began to persecute it in every
      possible way. A very interesting part of the Memorandum is the summary of
      facts on this persecution, notwithstanding its obvious incompleteness.
    

      We have seen how pusillanimous and irrational was the attitude of the liberals
      towards the revolutionary movement at the beginning of the sixties. Instead of
      supporting the

    

      "alliance of the petty-bourgeois townspeople and the peasants with
      the adherents of Velikoruss”, they feared this
      “alliance” and held it as a bogy with which to scare the
      government. Instead of rising to the defence of the leaders of the
      democratic movement, persecuted by the government, they pharisaically
      washed their hands of them and justified the action of the
      government. This treacherous policy of grandiloquence and shameful
      flabbiness met with poetic justice. Having dealt with those who proved
      themselves capable, not merely of jabbering about liberty, but of
      fighting for it, the government felt sufficiently strong to
      squeeze the liberals out of even the minor and inferior positions which
      they had occupied “with the permission of the authorities”. So
      long as the “alliance of the petty-bourgeois townspeople and the
      peasants” with the revolutionaries represented a serious menace, the
      Ministry of the Interior itself mumbled words about a “school of
      representative institutions”, but when the “tactless and
      cock-sure” hecklers and hotheads had been removed, the
      “scholars” were treated with an iron hand. Then a tragicomical
      epic began. The Zemstvo appealed for an extension of its rights, but was
      deprived of one right after another and given
      “fatherly” homilies in answer to its petitions. But let the
      historical dates, even those presented in the Memorandum, speak for
      themselves.
    

      On October 12, 1866, the Ministry of the Interior issued a circular
      subordinating the Zemstvo employees completely to government
      institutions. On November 21 a law was passed restricting the right of the
      Zemstvo in taxing commercial and industrial establishments. The
      St. Petersburg Zemstvo Assembly, in 1867, sharply criticised this law, and
      (on the proposal of Count A. P. Shuvalov) adopted a decision to petition
      the government to arrange for the questions touched upon by this law to be
      discussed by “the combined forces and with the simultaneous efforts
      of the central administration and the Zemstvo”. The government’s
      answer to this petition was to close down the St. Petersburg Zemstvo
      institutions and to resort to reprisals: the chairman of the
      St. Petersburg Zemstvo Board, Kruse, was banished to Orenburg; Count
      Shuvalov—to Paris; and Senator Luboshchinsky was ordered to
      resign. Severnaya Pockta, organ of the Ministry of the Interior,
      published an article in which “these

    

      stern measures of punishment were explained by the fact that the Zemstvo
      Assemblies, too, from the very opening of their sessions, had acted
      contrary to the law [to what law? and why were the law-breakers not
      brought to trial, when only shortly before a speedy, just, and
      merciful court procedure had been introduced?]; that instead of supporting
      the Zemstvo Assemblies of other gubernias, utilising for that purpose the
      rights which His Majesty has graciously granted them for exercising proper
      care over the local economic interests of the Zemstvo in their charge
      [i.e., instead of being humbly submissive and following the
      “intentions” of the officialdom], they strove continuously, by
      falsely explaining the case and misinterpreting the laws, to rouse
      sentiments of mistrust and lack of respect for the government”.
      After such an admonition, it is not surprising that “the other
      Zemstvos failed to support the St. Petersburg Zemstvo, although the law of
      November 21, 1866, had everywhere given rise to deep-going discontent, so
      that at meetings many people declared it to be tantamount to destroying
      the Zemstvos”.
    

      On December 16, 1866, the Senate issued a “clarification”
      granting the governors of the gubernias the right to refuse endorsement to
      any person elected by a Zemstvo Assembly whom the respective governor
      deemed politically unreliable. On May 4, 1867, there followed another
      Senate interpretation to the effect that communication of Zemstvo
      proposals to other gubernias was contrary to law, since Zemstvo
      institutions must concern themselves only with local affairs. On June 13
      the Council of State issued a ruling, with Imperial sanction, prohibiting
      publication of decisions, minutes, reports of discussions, etc., of the
      meetings of Zemstvo, urban, and social-estate assemblies without the
      consent of the gubernia authorities. Further, that law extended the powers
      of chairmen of Zemstvo Assemblies; it granted them the right to close
      meetings at their discretion and imposed upon them the obligation,
      under threat of punishment, to close any meeting at which
      questions not in consonance with the law were presented for
      discussion. The public greeted this measure with hostility, regarding it
      as a serious restriction of Zemstvo activity. “Every one knows,”
      Nikitenko entered in his diary, “that the Zemstvos.are tied hand and
      foot by the new ·regulations which give the chairmen of

    

      Assemblies and the governors of gubernias almost unlimited powers over
      them." The circular of October 8, 1868 makes it obligatory to obtain the
      consent of the governor for the publication even of the reports of the
      Zemstvo Boards and restricts inter-communication between Zemstvos. In 1869
      the office of inspector of elementary schools was established for the
      purpose of taking the effective management of elementary education out of
      the hands of the Zemstvos. A regulation issued by the Committee of
      Ministers on September 19, 1869, which received Imperial sanction,
      declares that “neither in their composition nor in their fundamental
      principles are Zemstvo institutions governmental authorities”. The
      law of July 4 and the circular of October 22, 1870 confirm and increase
      the subordination of Zemstvo employees to the governors of the
      gubernias. In 1871 instructions were issued to the inspectors of
      elementary schools empowering them to dismiss teachers who were·
      deemed politically unreliable and to suspend all decisions of the school
      councils and submit them to the school guardians for their sanction. On
      December 25, 1873, Alexander II, in a rescript addressed to the Minister
      of Education, expressed the fear that unless proper guardianship and
      control are exercised over them, the elementary schools may be
      converted “into an instrument for the moral corruption of the
      people, some attempts at which have already been disclosed,” and he
      ordered the marshals of the nobility, by their close co-operation, to
      preserve the moral influence of the schools. In 1874 a new regulation
      concerning the elementary schools was issued, which placed the management
      of the schools entirely in the hands of the head masters. The Zemstvo
      “protested”—if a petition pleading that the law be revised and
      that the representatives of the Zemstvo take part in this revision (the
      petition of the Kazan Zemstvo in 1874) can, without irony, be described as
      a protest. Of course, the petition was rejected. Etc., etc,
    

III

      Such was the first course of lessons given to Russian citizens in the
      “school of representative institutions” opened by the Ministry of
      the Interior. Fortunately, in addition to the political scholars who, in
      connection with the constitutional

    

      declarations of the sixties, wrote that “it is time to give up all
      nonsense and get down to business, and business is now in the Zemstvo
      institutions and nowhere

      else”,[12]

      there were in Russia also “hotheads”, who were not satisfied
      with such “tact” and went with revolutionary propaganda among
      the people. Although they adhered to a theory which in essence was not
      revolutionary, their propaganda roused a spirit of discontent and protest
      among broad strata of the educated youth. Despite their utopian theory,
      which rejected political struggle, the movement led to a desperate grapple
      between the government and a handful of heroes, to a struggle for
      political freedom. Thanks to this struggle, and to it alone, the situation
      again changed; the government was once more compelled to make concessions,
      and the liberals once again revealed their political immaturity, their
      inability to support the fighters and, bring real pressure to bear upon
      the government. The constitutional aspirations of the Zemstvo became very
      marked, but these proved to be but a feeble “impulse”, despite
      the fact that Zemstvo liberalism in itself had made decided political
      progress. Particularly noteworthy was its attempt to establish an illegal
      party and to set up its own political organ. In his Memorandum, Witte
      summarises some of these illegal writings (of Cannan, Dragomanov,
      Tikhomirov), in order to demonstrate the “slippery path”
      (p. 98) upon which the Zemstvo had entered. In the late seventies, several
      congresses of Zemstvo liberals were held. The liberals decided “to
      take measures to bring about at least a temporary cessation of the
      destructive activities of the extreme revolutionary party, for they were
      convinced that nothing could be achieved by peaceful means if the
      terrorists continued to irritate and alarm the government by threats and
      acts of violence” (p. 99). Thus, instead of making an effort to
      extend the struggle, to secure considerable public support for individual
      revolutionaries, to organise some sort of public pressure (in the form of
      demonstrations, of refusal by the Zemstvo to carry out compulsory
      expenditures, etc.), the liberals again appealed for
      “tact”—“not to irritate”

    

      the government!—to employ the “peaceful means” that had
      so brilliantly proved their futility in the

      sixties![13]

      Of course, the revolutionaries refused to agree to any cessation or
      suspension of fighting actions. The Zemstvo supporters then formed the
      League of Oppositional Elements, which was later transformed into the
      Zemstvo Union and Self-Government Society, or Zemstvo Union. The programme
      of the Zemstvo Union contained the following demands: (1) freedom of
      speech and the press, (2) inviolability of the person, and (3) the
      convocation of a Constituent Assembly. An attempt to publish illegal
      pamphlets in Galicia failed (the Austrian police seized the manuscripts
      and the persons who intended to print them), and in August 1881
      Volnoye

Slovo,[37]

      edited in Geneva by Dragomanov (ox-professor of Kiev University), became
      the official organ of the Zemstvo Union. “In the final analysis,”
      wrote Dragomanov in 1888, “the attempt to publish Volnoye
      Slovo as a Zemstvo organ cannot be regarded as successful, if only
      for the reason that Zemstvo material did not begin to reach the editorial
      office regularly until late in 1882 and publication ceased in May 1883"
      (op. cit., p. 40). The failure of the liberal organ was a natural effect
      of the weakness of the liberal movement. On November 20, 1878, Alexander
      II delivered a speech at a meeting of representatives of the
      social-estates in Moscow, in which he expressed the hope that “he
      would obtain their co-operation in checking the erring younger generation
      which was pursuing the fatal path whither suspect persons were striving to
      lead it.” Later, an appeal for public co-operation appeared in
      Pravitelstvenny

Vestnik[38]

      (No. 186, 1878). In reply, five Zemstvo Assemblies (Kharkov, Poltava,
      Chernigov, Samara, and Tver) issued declarations urging the need to
      convene a National Assembly. “We may believe also,” says Witte in
      his Memorandum, after summarising in detail the contents

    

      of these petitions, of which only three appeared in the press in full,
      “that the Zemstvo declarations on the convocation of a National
      Assembly would have been far more numerous, had not the Ministry of the
      Interior taken timely steps to prevent such declarations; the marshals of
      the nobility, as chairmen of gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies, received
      circular letters instructing them to prevent even the reading of such
      petitions at meetings of the assemblies. In some places, arrests were made
      and councillors banished. In Chernigov the meeting hall was invaded and
      forcibly cleared by gendarmes” (p. 104).
    

      The liberal magazines and newspapers supported the movement. A petition
      signed by “twenty-five prominent Moscow citizens” addressed to
      Loris-Melikov asked for the convocation of an independent assembly of
      representatives of the Zemstvos which should be given the right to
      participate in the government of the nation. In appointing Loris-Melikov
      Minister of the Interior, the government was apparently making a
      concession. But only apparently; for not only were no decisive
      steps taken, there were not even any declarations that might be called
      positive and incapable of misinterpretation. Loris-Melikov called together
      the editors of St. Petersburg periodicals and explained to them “the
      programme”: to learn the wishes, needs, etc., of the population, to
      enable the Zemstvos, etc., to enjoy their legal rights (the liberal
      programme guarantees the Zemstvos those “rights” of which the
      law systematically deprives them!), etc. The author of the Memorandum
      states:
    

      “Through the medium of these interlocutors the Minister’s programme
      was circulated throughout Russia—for which purpose they had been
      called together. In point of fact, the programme did not promise anything
      definite. One could read into it anything one desired, i.e., everything or
      nothing. A leaflet secretly distributed at the time was right in its way
      [only in “its” way, not absolutely in “every” way!]
      when it stated that the programme simultaneously wagged a ’fox tail’ and
      gnashed ’wolf’s fangs’. This attack on the programme and its author is the
      more understandable, be cause, in communicating the. programme to the
      representatives of the press, the Count strongly urged them ’not to
      confuse and not to excite the public mind needlessly with their

    

      visionary illusions’." But the liberal Zemstvo supporters refused to
      listen to the truth contained in the secret leaflet and accepted
      the wagging of the “fox tail” as a “new policy”
      worthy of confidence. “The Zemstvos believed and sympathised with
      the government,” says the Memorandum, quoting an illegally published
      pamphlet, The Opinions of the Zemstvo Assemblies on the Present State
      of Russia, “and they seemed afraid of running too far ahead and
      of pestering the government with excessive requests.” A characteristic
      admission on the part of the Zemstvo adherents, who enjoyed freedom of
      expression! The Zemstvo Union at its congress in 1880 had only just
      decided “to strive to secure central popular representation, of
      which an absolute condition would be a single chamber and universal
      suffrage”, when this decision to strive to secure was
      carried out by the tactic of refraining from “running too far
      ahead” and “believing and sympathising
      with” ambiguous declarations that bind no one to anything! With
      unpardonable naïveté, the Zemstvo adherents imagined that presenting
      petitions meant “striving to secure”—and petitions
      “poured in from the Zemstvos in abundance”. On January 28,
      1881, Loris-Melikov submitted a most humble Memorial to the tsar
      proposing the establishment of a commission of Zemstvo representatives
      with advisory powers only, for the purpose of drafting the laws His
      Majesty would be pleased to indicate. The Special Council set up by
      Alexander II approved of this measure; the findings of the Council of
      February 17, 1881, were confirmed by the Tsar, who also approved
      the text of the government announcement submitted by Loris-Melikov.
    

      “Undoubtedly,” writes Witte, “the establishment of such a
      purely advisory commission did not yet establish a constitution,” but, he
      continues, it can hardly be denied that it represented a step forward
      (following the reforms of the six ties) towards a constitution and towards
      nothing else. The author then repeats a statement contained in the foreign
      press to the effect that upon reading Loris-Melikov’s Memorial, Alexander
      II exclaimed: “Why, this is the États
      généraux.... What is proposed to us is neither more nor
      less than the Assembly of Notables of Louis

      XVI.”[39]


      We would observe, on our part, that under certain circumstances the
      application of Loris-Melikov’s proposal

    

      might have been a step towards a constitution, but it might also
      not have been; everything depended on which prevailed

      —the pressure of the revolutionary party and the liberal public, or
      the counter-pressure of the very powerful, compact party of persisting
      supporters of the autocracy that were unscrupulous in the methods they
      employed. If, however, we speak, not of what might have happened, but of
      what actually did happen, then we must admit the indubitable fact that the
      government was wavering. Some members of the government were in
      favour of strenuously resisting the liberals, while others were in favour
      of making concessions. But—and this is particularly
      important—even the latter wavered, having no very definite programme
      and never rising above the level of scheming bureaucrats.
    

      In his Memorandum, Witte writes:
    


      “Count Loris-Melikov appeared to be afraid to look the affair straight in
      the face and to define his programme with precision; he continued the evasive
      policy—in another direction, it is true—that had been adopted by
      Count Valuyev towards the Zemstvo institutions.
    

      “As even the legal press rightly pointed out at the time, the programme announced by Loris-Melikov was distinguished by its extreme
      vagueness. This vagueness is observed in all the Count’s subsequent
      actions and pronouncements. On the one hand, he declared that the
      autocracy was ’separated from the people’, that ’he looks to public sup
      port as the principal force...’, and that he regarded the proposed reform
      ’not as something final, but merely as a first step’, etc. On the other
      band, the Count declared at the same time to the press representatives
      that ’the hopes aroused among the people are nothing but a visionary
      illusion...’, and in his most humble Memorial to the Tsar, he stated categorically that a National Assembly would be ’a dangerous experiment of
      reverting to the past...’, that the measure he proposed would not in any
      way restrict the powers of the autocracy, since it had nothing in common
      with Western constitutional forms. Generally speaking, as L. Tikhomirov
      has fitly remarked, the Memorial itself is distinguished by its
      wonderfully confused wording” (p. 117).
    


      In his attitude towards the freedom fighters Loris-Melikov, that
      notorious hero of the “dictatorship of the

      heart”,[40]

      displayed “a cruelty unparalleled, before or since, in ordering the
      execution of a seventeen year-old youth for a printed leaflet found in his
      possession. Loris-Melikov did not forget the most remote parts of Siberia, and
      he did everything to worsen the conditions of the exiles suffering for their
      propaganda” (V. Zasulich in Sotsial
    

      Demokrat,[41]

      No. 1, p. 84). In view of the government’s wavering, only a force
      capable of earnest struggle could have secured a constitution; but such
      a force was lacking— the revolutionaries had exhausted themselves
      by their effort of
March 1[42];

      there was neither a broad movement nor a strong organisation of the
      working class, and the liberal public on this occasion again proved to
      be so politically immature that even after the assassination of
      Alexander II it restricted itself to the mere presentation of
      petitions. The Zemstvos, the municipalities, and the liberal press
      (Poryadok, Strana,

Golos[14]

),

      all presented petitions. Particularly loyal, artful, and nebulous were
      the petitions of the liberal authors of memoranda, such as the Marquis
      of Velepolski, Professor Chicherin, and Professor Gradovsky. Witte’s
      Memorandum reproduces their content from a pamphlet published in

      London,[15]
The Constitution of Count Loris-Melikov (Free Russian Press
      Fund, London, 1893). Those authors invented “ingenious devices for
      bringing the monarch to cross the Rubicon without his being aware of
      it”. It stands to reason that all these cautious petitions and
      artful devices proved utterly useless without a revolutionary force, and
      the autocratic party triumphed—triumphed despite the fact that on
      March

      8,1881, 

      a majority of the Council of Ministers (seven against five) had voted
      in favour of Loris-Melikov’s proposal. (So the pamphlet has it;
      but Witte, who assiduously cites its authors, for some reason or other
      declares in his Memorandum: “It is not authentically known what
      happened at this meeting of March 8 and what it resulted in; it would be
      rash to rely upon the rumours that have reached the foreign press,”
      p. 124). On April 29, 1881, the Manifesto on the reaffirmation and
      preservation of autocracy, described by Katkov as “manna from
      heaven”, was promulgated.
    

    

      For the second time since the emancipation of the peasants the
      revolutionary tide was swept back, and following it and as a consequence
      of it, the liberal movement for a second time gave way to
      reaction, over which Russian progressive society, of course,
      raised bitter lamentations. We are past masters of the art of lamentation;
      we lament the tactlessness and self-assurance of revolutionaries in
      harassing the government; we lament the government’s indecisiveness when,
      finding that it is not confronted by a real force, it makes
      pseudo-concessions and takes back with one hand what it has given with the
      other; we lament “the age without ideas and ideals”, when the
      government, having settled scores with revolutionaries whom the people
      failed to support, hastens to make up for lost time and fortifies itself
      for a fresh onslaught.
    

IV

      The epoch of the “dictatorship of the heart”, as
      Loris-Melikov’s ministry has been described, proved to our liberals that
      even the “constitutionalism” of one of the ministers, even of
      the Prime Minister, with the government wavering and the Council of
      Ministers approving “the first step towards reform” by a
      majority, still guarantees precisely nothing, if there is no serious
      social force capable of compelling the government to surrender. It is
      interesting to note also that the government of Alexander III did not show
      its fangs immediately upon the promulgation of the Manifesto reaffirming
      the autocracy, but found it necessary for a time to fool the
      “public”. In employing the term “fool” the public,
      we do not suggest that the government adopted the Machiavellian scheme of
      some minister, notable, or other. It cannot be over-emphasised that the
      system of pseudo-concessions and of seemingly important steps “to
      meet” public opinion has become an integral part of the policy of
      every modern government, including the Russian, for the Russian Government
      has for many generations recognised the necessity of reckoning with public
      opinion in one way or another, and in the course of many generations has
      trained statesmen in the shrewd art of domestic diplomacy. Such a diplomat
      was Count Ignatyev, whose appointment to the Ministry of the Interior in
      place of Loris-Melikov was intended to cover the

    

      government’s retreat towards out and out reaction. More than once Ignatyev
      proved himself a demagogue and deceiver of the worst type, so much so that
      Witte reveals in his Memorandum not a little “police
      complacency” when he describes the period of his office as an
      “unsuccessful attempt to create a country with local self-government
      and with an autocratic tsar at its head”. True, this is precisely
      the “formula” advanced at the time by I. S. Aksakov; it was
      utilised by the government for its manoeuvres and was assailed by Katkov,
      who proved conclusively that there is a necessary connection between local
      self-government and a constitution. But it would be short-sighted to
      attempt to explain the well-known tactics of the police
      government (tactics deriving from its very nature) by the prevalence of
      this or that political view at the given moment.
    

      Ignatyev issued a circular, in which he promised that the government would
      “take urgent measures to introduce proper methods to secure, with
      the maximum of success, the active participation of local public figures
      in the execution of His Majesty’s designs”. The Zemstvos responded
      to this “call” by petitions pleading for the convocation of an
      assembly “of the elected representatives of the people” (from
      the memorandum of a member of the Cherepovets Zemstvo; the governor did
      not even permit the opinion of a member of the Kirillov Zemstvo to be
      published). The government instruct ed the governors to “take no
      further action” with regard to these petitions; “at the same
      time, measures were apparently taken to prevent other assemblies from
      submitting similar petitions”. The notorious attempt was made to
      call a conference of “qualified people” hand-picked by the
      ministers (for the purpose of discussing questions of reducing land
      redemption

      payments,[43]

      regulating migration, reforming local government,
      etc.). “The work of the committees of experts evoked no sympathy
      among the public and, not withstanding all the precautionary
      measures, even aroused a direct protest from the Zemstvos. Twelve
      Zemstvo Assemblies petitioned that Zemstvo representatives be invited to
      participate in legislative activity, not only on special occasions and by
      appointment from the government, but permanently and by election from the
      Zemstvos.” An attempt by the Samara Zemstvo to adopt a similar motion was
      prevented

    

      by the chairman, “after which the Assembly broke up in
      protest” (Dragomanov, op. cit., p. 29; Memorandum, p. 131). That
      Count Ignatyev duped the Zemstvos is apparent from the following
      fact: “Mr. Ustimovich, Marshal of the Poltava Nobility and author of
      the draft Constitutional Petition of 1879, openly declared in the Gubernia
      Assembly of Nobles that he had received positive assurances
      [sic!] from Count Ignatyev that the government would call upon
      the representatives of the country to take part in legislative
      activity” (Dragomanov, ibid.).
    

      These frauds of Ignatyev crowned the work of covering up the government’s
      transition to a decisively new policy, and not without good reason did
      D. A. Tolstoi, who on May 30, 1882, was appointed Minister of the
      Interior, earn the nickname “Minister of Struggle”. Petitions
      from the Zemstvos even for the convening of some sort of private
      conferences were unceremoniously rejected. There was even a case of a
      government commission replacing a Zemstvo Board and banishing its members,
      on a complaint lodged by a governor against “the systematic
      opposition” of the Zemstvo (of Cherepovets). D. A. Tolstoi, a
      faithful disciple and follower of Katkov, went further and decided to
      “reform” the Zemstvo institutions. The idea underlying the
      reform (which, as we have seen, was confirmed by history) was that
      “the opposition to the government has strongly entrenched itself in
      the Zemstvos” (p. 139 of the Memorandum, dealing with the original
      plan for Zemstvo reform). D. A. Tolstoi planned. to replace the Zemstvo
      Boards with bureaus subordinated to the governor and to make all decisions
      of the Zemstvo Assemblies subject to the governor’s sanction. This would
      have been a truly “radical” reform; but it is extremely
      interesting to note that even this disciple of Katkov, this
      “Minister of Struggle”, in the words of the Memorandum,
      “did not abandon the usual policy of the Ministry of the Interior
      towards the Zemstvo institutions. In the draft of his project, Tolstoi did
      not openly express his idea, actually to abolish the Zemstvos; on the
      pretext of correctly developing the principle of local self-government, he
      sought to preserve their external form, but, at the same time, deprive
      them of all internal substance”. This cunning policy of “the
      fox tail” was still further supplemented and developed in the

    

      Council of State, with the result that the Zemstvo Regulations of 1890
      “proved to be another half-measure in the history of Zemstvo
      institutions. They did not abolish the Zemstvos, but rendered them
      featureless and colourless; they did not destroy their character as being
      representative of all social-estates, but they gave them a social-estate
      tinge; ... they did not convert the Zemstvo institutions into regular
      organs of the state, ... but increased the power of the governors over
      them ... and increased the governor’s power of veto”. “The
      Regulations of July 12, 1890, were, in keeping with their author’s design,
      a step in the direction of abolishing the Zemstvo institutions, not a
      radical reform of Zemstvo local self-government.”
    

      The Memorandum goes on to state that this new “half measure”
      did not remove the opposition to the government (it was, of course,
      impossible to remove the opposition to a reactionary government by
      intensifying that reaction), but merely drove certain of its
      manifestations below the surface. The opposition manifested itself, first,
      in the fact that certain anti-Zemstvo laws—if one may so term
      them— met with resistance and were not carried out de
      facto; it manifested itself, again, in constitutional (or, at all
      events, constitution-flavoured) petitions. Thus, the law of June 10, 1893,
      which tied up the Zemstvo medical service in a tangle of detailed
      regulations, met with the first-mentioned type of opposition. “The
      Zemstvo institutions put up a strenuous resistance to the Ministry of the
      Interior, which had to make a retreat. The Ministry was compelled to
      suspend the introduction of new regulations, already drafted, to reserve
      them for a complete collection of the laws, and to draft a fresh proposal
      on altogether different principles [i.e., principles more acceptable to
      the Zemstvos].” The Assessment of Real Estate Act of June 8,1893, which
      similarly introduced the principle of regulation and restricted the rights
      of the Zemstvos in the assessment of rates, likewise gave rise to
      dissatisfaction, and in many cases “is not being applied in
      practice”. The medical and statistical institutions established by
      the Zemstvos, which have brought considerable benefit to the population
      (as compared with the bureaucracy, of course), proved themselves of
      sufficient strength to paralyse the regulations drawn up in the
      chancelleries of St. Petersburg.
    

    

      The second form of opposition also found expression in the new Zemstvo, in
      1894, when the Zemstvo petitions to Nicholas II renewed very definitely
      their demand for the extension of local self-government and gave rise to
      the “celebrated” words about senseless dreaming.
    

      To the horror of the ministers, the “political tendencies” of
      the Zemstvos did not disappear. The author of the Memorandum cites the
      bitter complaints of the Governor of Tver (from his report of 1898) over
      the “closely knit group of people of liberal views” which had
      concentrated the affairs of the gubernia Zemstvo entirely in its own
      hands. “From the same governor’s report for 1895, it is apparent
      that the struggle against the Zemstvo opposition presents a difficult task
      for the local administration and that the marshals of the nobility, who
      officiate as chairmen at Zemstvo meetings, are sometimes called upon to
      display ’civic courage’ [sic!] in carrying out the instructions
      contained in the confidential circulars of the Ministry of the Interior on
      matters in which the Zemstvo institutions must not interfere." It is
      further related how, at one of the meetings of the assembly, the gubernia
      Marshal of the Nobility turned over his post as chairman to the uyezd [*
      See footnote to p. 36.—Tr.] Marshal (Tver), how the Tver
      Marshal in his turn passed it on to the Novy Torzhok Marshal, and how the
      Novy Torzhok Marshal also fell ill and handed over the post to the
      Staritsa Marshal. And so, even the marshals of the nobility flinch from
      carrying out police functions! “The law of 1890 [laments the author
      of the Memorandum] gave the Zemstvo a social-estate tinge, strengthened
      the government element in the assemblies, and appointed all the uyezd
      marshals of the nobility and rural

      superintendents[44]

      to the gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies, and the fact that these featureless,
      social-estate, bureaucratic Zemstvos continue nevertheless to betray
      political tendencies, is a matter that should be pondered.... Resistance
      has not been overcome; deep discontent and silent opposition undoubtedly
      exist, and will continue to exist until the Zemstvo representing all
      estates dies." Such is the last word in bureaucratic wisdom. If curtailed
      representation gives rise to discontent, then the abolition of every kind
      of representation

    

      will, by simple human logic, strengthen this discontent and
      opposition. Mr. Witte imagines, however, that if one of the institutions
      that bring at least a particle of discontent to the surface is closed
      down, the discontent will disappear. Perhaps you think that Witte proposes
      something as resolute as the abolition of the Zemstvo? Nothing of the
      kind. Although, for the sake of fine words, he condemns the policy of
      evasion, Witte himself has nothing else but this policy to propose; nor
      can he have, without shedding the skin of minister of the autocratic
      government. Witte mumbles arrant nonsense about a “third
      way"—neither bureaucratic domination nor local self-government, but
      an administrative reform which should “properly organise” the
      “participation of public elements in government
      institutions”. It is easy to emit nonsense of this kind, hut after
      all the experiments with “qualified people” no one will be
      deceived by it; it is only too obvious that without a
      constitution any “participation of public elements” will
      be a fiction, will mean the subordination of the public (or those
      “called” from the public) to the bureaucracy. While
      criticising a particular measure of the Ministry of the Interior (the
      establishment of Zemstvos in the outlying regions), Witte cannot suggest
      any thing new on the general question he himself raises, but merely warms
      up the old methods—half-measures, pseudo-concessions, and promises
      of numerous benefits, none of which are fulfilled. It cannot he too
      strongly emphasised that on the general question of “the direction
      of domestic policy”, Witte and Goremykin are at one, and that the
      controversy between them is merely a family quarrel, a feud within the
      clan. On the one hand, Witte hastens to declare, “I have never
      proposed nor do I now propose the abolition of Zemstvo institutions or any
      radical change in the present system ... under present conditions there
      can hardly be any talk of abolishing them [the existing Zemstvos
      I”. Witte, “on his part, thinks that with the establishment of
      strong governmental authority in the localities, it will be possible to
      place greater confidence in the Zemstvos”, etc. After establishing a
      strong local bureaucracy to counterbalance local self-government (i.e.,
      rendering local self-government impotent), one can place greater
      “confidence” in it. The same old song! Mr. Witte fears only
      “institutions representing all

    

      the social-estates”; he “did not have in mind the various
      corporations, societies, unions of the social-estates or trade unions and
      did not consider their activities to be dangerous to the
      autocracy”. For example, in regard to the “village
      communes”, Mr. Witte does not doubt in the least that in view of
      their “inertness” they are harmless to the
      autocracy. “The predominance of landownership relations and the
      interests connected with them develop spiritual peculiarities in the rural
      population which render it indifferent to anything outside the politics of
      the village pump.... Our peasants at village meetings concern themselves
      with the apportioning of taxes, ... the distribution of allotments,
      etc. Moreover, they are illiterate or semi-literate—what sort of
      politics then can they concern themselves with?" Mr. Witte is
      extremely sober-minded, as you see. In regard to the unions of
      social-estates he declares that from the point of view of the danger they
      represent to the central government “their diversity of interests is
      of great importance. The government, by taking advantage of this diversity
      of interests, can always find support in one social-estate and play it off
      against the political claims of the others”. Witte’s programme of
      “properly organised participation of public elements in govern ment
      institutions” is nothing but another of the innumerable attempts of
      the police state to “split” the population.
    

      On the other hand, Mr. Goremykin, with whom Mr. Witte enters into such
      heated controversy, himself carries out this very systematic policy of
      disunity and persecution. He argues (in his Memorandum, to which Witte
      rejoins) that it is necessary to institute mew offices to supervise the
      Zemstvo; he is opposed to permitting even simple local congresses of
      Zemstvo civil servants; he stands whole-heartedly for the Regulations of
      1890—that step towards the abolition of the Zemstvos; he fears the
      effort of the Zemstvos to include “tendentious questions” in
      their programme of assessment work; he fears Zemstvo statistics generally;
      he is in favour of taking the elementary schools out of the hands of the
      Zemstvos and placing them under the control of government institutions; he
      argues that the Zemstvos are incapable of handling the questions connected
      with the food supply (Zemstvo workers, don’t you see, encourage
      “exaggerated notions of the extent of the disaster and the needs of
      the

    

      famine-stricken population”!!); and he defends the fixing of limits to
      Zemstvo taxation, “in order to protect landed property from
      excessive increases in Zemstvo taxes”. Witte is entirely right,
      therefore, when he says: “The entire policy of the Ministry of the
      Interior towards the Zemstvos consists in slowly but steadily undermining
      their organs, weakening their significance, and concentrating their
      functions in the hands of government institutions. It may be said without
      the slightest exaggeration that when the ’recently adopted measures’
      referred to in the Memorandum [Goremykin’s] ’regulating the various
      branches of Zemstvo work and administration’ are brought to a successful
      conclusion, we shall have no local self-government whatever. All that will
      be left of the Zemstvo institutions will be a mere idea and a shell
      without any real content.” Consequently, the policy of Goremykin (and more
      so the policy of Sipyagin) and of Witte lead to the same goal, and the
      controversy over the question of the Zemstvo and constitutionalism is, we
      repeat, nothing more than a family quarrel. Lovers’ tiffs are easily made
      up again. The “fight” between Mr. Wit{e and Mr. Goremykin is
      nothing more serious than that. As for our own views on the general
      question of the autocracy and the Zemstvos, it will be more convenient to
      present them in the process of analysing the preface written by
R. N. S.[16]


V

      Mr. R. N. S.’s preface represents much that is of interest. It touches
      upon the broadest questions of political reforms in Russia, the various
      methods by which these reforms can be effected, and the significance of
      the various forces leading to these reforms. On the other hand,
      Mr. R. N. S., who apparently has close relations with liberal circles
      generally, and Zemstvo liberal circles in particular, undoubtedly sounds a
      new note in the chorus of our “underground”
      literature. Therefore, in order to clear up the question of the political
      significance of the Zemstvos in principle and to acquaint ourselves with
      the tendencies and, I shall not say directions,

    

      but moods, in the circles close to the liberals, it will be well worth our
      while to deal in detail with this preface and determine whether that which
      is new in it is positive or negative, and to what extent it is positive
      and to what extent negative and why.
    

      The fundamental feature of R. N. S. ’s views is the following. As can be
      seen from numerous passages of his essay, quoted below, he favours
      peaceful, gradual, and strictly legal development. On the other hand, he
      rebels with all his being against the autocracy and yearns for political
      freedom. But the autocracy is an autocracy precisely because it prohibits
      and persecutes all “development” towards
      freedom. This contradiction permeates the whole of R. N. S. ’s essay and
      renders his argumentation extremely illogical, hesitant, and
      unsound. Constitutionalism can be combined with solicitude for the
      strictly legal development of autocratic Russia only on the premise or, at
      least, on the assumption that the autocratic government itself
      will understand, grow weary, yield, etc. And Mr. R. N. S. does, indeed, at
      times fall from the height of his civic indignation to the vulgar
      viewpoint of the most immature liberalism. Thus, he says of himself:
      "... we who regard the struggle for civil liberties waged by
      politically conscious people in Russia today to be their vow of Hannibal,
      a vow as sacred as that taken by the men and women who fought for the
      emancipation of the peasants in the forties " ... and, again,
      “however trying it is to those of us who have taken the ’vow of
      Hannibal’ to fight against the autocracy”, etc. Well said,
      powerfully said! Powerful words like these would have been an
      embellishment to the article, if the same spirit of indomitable and
      irreconcilable struggle ("the vow of Hannibal”) had pervaded it
      throughout. But these powerful words, precisely because they are so
      powerful, sound discordant when accompanied by a note of artificial
      conciliation and pacification, by an attempt to introduce, even with the
      aid of far-fetched interpretations, the conception of peaceful, strictly
      legal development. Mr. R. N. S., unfortunately, evinces more than enough
      such notes and such attempts. He devotes a page and a half, for instance,
      to a detailed “argumentation” of the idea that “the
      policy of the state during the reign of Nicholas II deserves even
      severer [our italics] condemnation from

    

      the moral and political points of view than the wicked revision of the
      reforms of Alexander II carried out during the reign of Alexander
      III”. Why severer condemnation? It appears that this is
      because Alexander III fought against revolution, while Nicholas II fought
      against “the legal aspirations of Russian society”; the former
      fought against politically conscious forces, the latter against
      “quite peaceful social forces often acting without any clear
      political idea” (“hardly even realising that their purposive
      cultural work was undermining the state system”). To a considerable degree
      this is untrue in point of fact, as we shall show further on. But apart
      from this, one cannot help noting the author’s peculiar line of
      reasoning. He condemns autocracy, but condemns one autocrat more
      than another, not because of policy, for that has remained unchanged, but
      because he (allegedly) has no “hotheads” to contend with,
      such as “naturally” call forth sharp resistance, and,
      consequently, he has no occasion for persecutions. Is not such an argument
      an obvious concession to the loyal and humble contention that Our Father
      the Tsar need not fear to call together his beloved people because they
      have never dreamed of anything beyond the bounds of peaceful strivings and
      strict legality? We are not surprised to find such a “train of
      thought” (or train of lies) in the works of Mr. Witte, who writes in
      his Memorandum: “One would suppose, when there are no political
      parties and there is no revolution, and when the rights of the supreme
      authority are not being challenged, that the administration should not be
      contraposed to the people or

      society...",[17]

      etc. We are not surprised to meet with such arguments in the writings of
      Mr. Chicherin, who, in the Memorandum presented to Count Milyutin after
      March 1,1881, declared that “the authorities must first of all
      display their energy and show that they have not lowered their flag in the
      face of danger”, that “the monarchical system is compatible
      with free institutions only when the latter are the fruit of peaceful
      development and the calm initiative of the supreme authority
      itself”, and who recommended the

    

      establishment of a “strong and liberal” government functioning
      with the aid of a “legislative organ strengthened and renovated by
      the elective

      element”.[18]

      Now, it would be quite natural for such a
      Mr. Chicherin to acknowledge that the policy of Nicholas II deserves
      greater condemnation, because under his rule peaceful development
      and the calm initiative of the supreme authority itself could have
      led to free institutions. But is it natural and decent to hear such
      reasoning from a man who took the vow of Hannibal to struggle?

    

      Mr. R. N. S. is wrong in point of fact. “Now,” he says, comparing
      the present reign with the preceding one, “no one thinks seriously
      of the violent overthrow wishfully imagined by the adherents of Narodnaya
      Volya.” Parlez pour vous, monsieur! Speak only for yourself. We
      know quite definitely that the revolutionary movement in Russia, far from
      having died out or subsided in the present as compared with the previous
      reign, has, on the contrary, revived and become many times stronger. What
      kind of “revolutionary” movement would it be, if none of the
      participants thought seriously of a violent change? The objection may be
      raised that in the quoted lines Mr. R. N. S. has in mind, not violent
      revolution in general, but a specific “Narodnaya Volya”
      revolution, i.e., a revolution that will be both political and social at
      the same time, a revolution that will lead, not only to the overthrow of
      the autocracy, but to the seizure of power. Such an objection, however,
      would be groundless, first, because to the autocracy as such (i.e., to the
      autocratic government and not to the “bourgeoisie” or
      “society”) it is not important for what reason people want
      to overthrow it; important is the fact that they want to
      overthrow it. Secondly, at the beginning of the reign of Alexander III,
      the Narodnaya Volya adherents “presented” to the government
      the very alternative that Social-Democracy now presents to Nicholas
      II—either revolutionary struggle or the renunciation of autocratic
      power. (See the Letter of the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya to
      Alexander III, dated March 10, 1881, which put forward two conditions: (1)
      a general amnesty for all political offenders, and (2) the

    

      convening of an assembly of representatives of the entire Russian people
      on the basis of universal suffrage, freedom of the press, speech, and
      assembly.) Mr. R. N. S. himself knows perfectly well that many people, not
      only among the intelligentsia, but also among the working class,
      “think seriously” about a violent revolution; see page xxxix
      et seq. of his essay, where reference is made to “revolutionary
      Social-Democracy”, which possesses a “mass basis and
      intellectual forces”, which is advancing towards “the decisive
      political struggle”, towards the “sanguinary struggle of
      revolutionary Russia against the absolutist-bureaucratic
      régime” (p. xli).There is not the slightest doubt, therefore,
      that Mr. R. N. S. ’s “loyal speeches” constitute a special
      method, an attempt to influence the government (or “public opinion”)
      by demonstrating his (or other people’s) modesty.
    

      Mr. R. N. S., by the way, thinks that the term “struggle” may
      be given a very wide interpretation. “The abolition of the Zemstvo,”
      he writes, “will place a trump card in the hands of revolutionary
      propagandists—we say this quite objectively [sic!],
      without, on the one hand, experiencing repulsion against what is usually
      termed revolutionary action, or, on the other, being carried away with
      infatuation or admiration for this form [sic!] of struggle for
      political and social progress." This is a most remarkable tirade. If we
      remove the quasi-scientific formula, this inappropriate parading of
      “objectivity” (since the author himself mentions his
      preference for one or another form of activity or of struggle, the
      protestation of his objectivity rates in value with the statement, two and
      two equal one stearin candle), we shall find the hoary argument: Gentlemen
      of the government, you may believe me when I begin to scare you with
      revolution, because my heart is not in it. His reference to objectivity is
      nothing more nor less than a fig-leaf intended to conceal subjective
      antipathy to revolution and revolutionary activity. And
      Mr. R. N. S. stands in need of a fig-leaf, because such antipathy is
      totally incompatible with the vow of Hannibal.
    

      By the way, are we not making a mistake about this Hannibal? Did he really take
      a vow to struggle against the Romans, or only to fight for the progress of
      Carthage, which progress, of course, in the final analysis, would be to
      the injury

    

      of Rome? Can the term “struggle” be understood other wise than
      in its “narrow” meaning? Mr. R.N.S.thinks it can. A comparison of
      the vow of Hannibal with the above-mentioned tirade yields the conclusion
      that struggle against the autocracy manifests itself in various
      “forms”: one form is the revolutionary, illegal struggle;
      another form is “struggle for political and social progress”
      in general, in other words peaceful legal activity, which disseminates
      culture within the limits permitted by the autocracy. We do not doubt in
      the least that it is possible even under the autocracy to carry on legal
      activity which promotes Russian progress, in some cases fairly rapid
      technological progress, in a few cases insignificant social progress, and,
      in exceptional cases, political progress to a very slight extent. We may
      argue about the magnitude of this slight progress and the extent to which
      it is possible, the extent to which isolated cases of such progress are
      capable of paralysing the mass political demoralisation which the
      autocracy is constantly sowing among the population everywhere. But to
      include, even indirectly, peaceful legal activity in the conception of
      struggle against the autocracy means to facilitate this work of
      demoralisation and to weaken the as it is infinitely weak consciousness of
      the Russian man in the street of his responsibility as citizen for
      everything the government does.
    

      Unfortunately, Mr. R. N. S. is not alone among the illegal writers who
      seek to obliterate the difference between revolutionary struggle and
      peaceful uplift activities. He has a predecessor in the person of B. M.,
      author of the article “Our Reality”, published in the
      celebrated “Separate Supplement” to Rabochaya

      Mysl[45]

      (September 1899). In his controversy with the Social-Democratic
      revolutionaries, Mr. B. M. wrote: “The struggle for the Zemstvo and
      for municipal self-government, the struggle for public schools, the
      struggle for public courts, the struggle for public aid to the famine-
      stricken population, etc., all represent the struggle against the
      autocracy.... This social struggle, which for some unexplained reason
      fails to attract the favourable interest of many Russian revolutionary
      writers, is, as we have seen, being waged by Russian society, and not only
      since yesterday.... The question now is how these separate social strata
      ... can wage the struggle against the autocracy most effectively....

    

      The principal question for us is how this social struggle against the
      autocracy should be waged by our workers, whose movement our
      revolutionaries regard as the best means of overthrowing the
      autocracy” (pp. 8-9). As can be seen, Mr. R. M. does not bother to
      conceal his antipathy towards the revolutionaries; he openly characterises
      legal opposition and peaceful activity as struggle against the autocracy,
      and the most important question for him is how the workers should conduct
      this struggle. Mr. R. N. S. is not nearly so crude and open, but
      the kinship between the political trends of this liberal and of the ardent
      worshipper of the labour movement pure and simple, is very definitely

      apparent.[19]


      With respect to Mr. R. N. S. ’s “objectivity”, we must say
      that he sometimes simply casts it aside. He is “objective”
      when he speaks of the working-class movement, of its organic growth, of
      the future inevitable struggles between revolutionary Social-Democracy and
      the autocracy, and when he states that the abolition of the Zemstvos will
      inevitably force the liberals to organise an illegal party. All this is
      set forth in a very business-like and sober manner, so sober indeed that
      one can only rejoice that the working-class movement in Russia is so well
      understood in liberal circles. But when, instead of fighting the enemy,
      Mr. R. N. S. begins to talk about the possibility of
      “submission” on the part of the enemy, he forfeits his
      “objectivity”, gives expression to his real sentiments, and
      even passes from the indicative mood to the imperative.
    


      “Only in the event of people being found among those in power courageous
      enough to submit to history and to compel the autocrat to

    

      submit to it, will the final and bloody struggle between revolutionary
      Russia and the autocratic-bureaucratic régime be avoided.... No
      doubt there are men among the higher bureaucracy who do not sympathise
      with the reactionary policy.... These men, the only persons having access
      to the throne, never dare to express their convictions openly.... Perhaps
      the enormous shadow of the inevitable, historic day of retribution, the
      shadow of great events, will cause the government circles to waver and
      will destroy the iron system of reactionary policy while there is yet
      time. Comparatively little is required for this now.... Perhaps it [the
      government] will realise, before it is too late, the fatal danger of
      protecting the autocratic régime at all costs. Perhaps even before
      it has to face revolution, it will grow weary of its struggle against the
      natural and historically necessary development of freedom, and will waver
      in its ’irreconcilable’ policy. If it ceases to be consistent in its
      struggle against freedom, it will be obliged to open the door wider and
      wider for it. It may be ... no, not only may be, but so shall it
      be!”  (Author’s italics).
    


      Amen! is all that we need add to this well-intentioned and lofty
      monologue. Our Hannibal makes such rapid progress that be now appears
      before us in a third form. The first was the struggle against the
      autocracy, the second—the spreading of culture, the
      third—appeals to the enemy to submit and attempts to frighten him
      with a “shadow”. How frightful! We quite agree with our
      respected Mr. R. N. S. that the sanctimonious hypocrites of the Russian
      Government are sooner frightened by “shadows” than by anything
      else on earth. Immediately prior to conjuring up shadows, our author, in
      referring to the growth of the revolutionary forces and to the impending
      revolutionary outbreak, exclaimed: “We foresee with profound sorrow
      the horrible price in people and in cultural forces that will have to be
      paid for this madly aggressive, conservative policy which has neither
      political sense nor a shadow of moral justification.” What a bottomless
      pit of doctrinairism and unction is revealed by this conclusion to an
      argument about the revolutionary out break! The author fails completely to
      understand the enormous historical significance it would have, if, for
      once at least, the people of Russia taught the government a good
      lesson. Instead of showing the “horrible price” the people
      have paid and are still paying to absolutism, in order to arouse their
      hatred and indignation and instil in them a readiness and a passion for
      struggle, you talk about future sacrifices in order to frighten
      people away

    

      from the struggle. My good gentlemen! It would be far better for you to
      refrain altogether from talking about the “revolutionary
      outbreak” than to ruin your reasoning with such a
      finale. Apparently, you do not wish to create “great
      events”, you merely want to talk about “the shadow of great
      events”, and then only with “persons having access to the
      throne”.
    

      Our legal press, as we know, is chock-full of such talk with shadows and
      about shadows; and in order to give substance to the shadows, it has
      become fashionable to refer to the “great reforms” and to sing
      to them hallelujahs full of conventional lies. An author writing under the
      surveillance of the censor may sometimes be forgiven such lies, since
      otherwise he would never be able to express his striving for political
      reforms. But no censorship hovered over Mr. H. N. S. He writes, “The
      great reforms were not devised for the greater triumph of the
      bureaucracy.” How evasive this apologetic phrase is. By whom
      “devised”? By Herzen, Chernyshevsky, Unkovsky, and those who marched
      with them? But these people demanded ever so much more than was effected
      by the “reforms”, and because of this they were persecuted by
      the government that introduced the “great” reforms. By the
      government and by those who followed it blindly singing its praises and
      snarling at the “hot heads”? But the government strove by every
      means in its power to concede as little as possible, and to curtail the
      democratic demands precisely for the “greater triumph of
      the bureaucracy”. Mr. B. N. S. is well aware of these historical
      facts, and he obscures them only for the reason that they entirely refute
      his smug theory of the possible “submission” of the
      autocrat. There is no place for submissiveness in politics, and
      the time-honoured police method of divide et impera, divide and
      rule, yield the unimportant in order ’to preserve the essential, give with
      one hand and take back with the other, can be mistaken for submission only
      out of unbounded simplicity (both sacred and sly simplicity). ". .When the government of Alexander II devised and
      introduced the ’great reforms’, it did not at the same time deliberately
      set itself the aim of cutting off imperatively all the Russian people’s
      legal roads to political liberty, it did not weigh its every step and
      every paragraph of the

    

      law with this end in view." This is untrue! The government of
      Alexander II, both in “devising” the reforms and in introducing them, set out from the very beginning to reject the demands for
      political freedom then put forward. From the beginning to the end it cut
      off every legal road to liberty; for it answered even simple appeals with
      repressions, it never even permitted liberty to be
      discussed freely. Suffice it to recall the facts mentioned in Witte’s
      Memorandum, quoted above, to refute Mr. R. N. S.’s paeans of
      praise. Concerning the persons in the government of Alexander II, Witte
      expresses himself, for example, as follows: “It must be observed
      that the prominent statesmen of the sixties, whose celebrated names will
      be preserved by a grateful posterity, in their time did more that is great
      than anything their successors may have done; they toiled at the
      renovation of our state and social system from sincere conviction, not to
      frustrate the strivings of their ruler, but out of unbounded loyalty to
      him” (p. 67 of the Memorandum). What is true is true—from
      sincere conviction, out of unbounded loyalty to the ruler at the head of
      the police gang....
    

      After this we are not surprised that Mr. II. N. S. says very little about
      the most important question of the role of the Zemstvos in the struggle
      for political liberty. Apart from the usual references to the
      “practical” and “cultural” work of the Zemstvo, he
      mentions in passing its “educational-political significance”;
      he says that the “Zemstvo has political significance”, that
      the Zemstvo, as Mr. Witte clearly sees, “is dangerous [to the
      present system] only by virtue of the historical tendency of its
      development—as the embryo of a constitution”. And, concluding
      these seem ingly casual remarks, comes the following attack upon
      revolutionaries: “We value Mr. Witte’s work, not only for the truth
      it tells about the autocracy, but also as a valuable political testimonial
      to the Zemstvo granted by the bureaucracy itself. This testimonial is an
      excellent reply to all those who, being devoid of political education or
      carried away by revolutionary phrases [sic!], have refused to see
      the enormous political significance of the Russian Zemstvos and their
      legal cultural activity." Who has revealed a lack of education? Who is
      carried away? Where and when? With whom does Mr. R. N. S. disagree? And
      why? To these questions

    

      no reply is forthcoming, and our author’s attack is nothing but an
      expression of his antipathy towards revolutionaries, which we know from
      other passages in his essay. Matters are not clarified by the still
      stranger comment:

      "By these words we do not desire I?!] to offend revolutionaries whose
      moral courage in the struggle against tyranny cannot be too highly
      estimated.”  Wherefore this remark? What connection is there between moral
      courage and inability to appreciate the Zemstvos? Mr. H. N. S. has indeed
      fallen out of the frying-pan into the fire. First he
      “offended” the revolutionaries by making an unsupported and
      “anonymous” (i.e., not known against whom levelled) charge of
      ignorance and phrase-mongering, and now he commits a fresh
      “offence” against them by assuming that they can be induced to
      swallow the charge of ignorance if the pill is sweetened by recognition of
      their moral courage. To complete the confusion, Mr. H. N. S. contradicts
      himself by declaring, in chorus, as it were, with those who are
      “carried away by revolutionary phrases”, that “the
      modern Russian Zemstvo ... is not a political mag nitude that could
      impress or overawe anyone by its own direct power.... It can barely
      maintain its own position”.... “Only in the remote future and
      only as a result of the cultural development of the whole country could
      such institutions [as the Zemstvo] ... become a menace to this
      [absolutist] system.”
    

VI

      Let us, however, try to analyse the issue on which Mr.  R. N. S. speaks so
      angrily and emptily. The facts we have cited above show that the
      “political significance” of the Zemstvos, i.e., their
      significance as a factor in the struggle for political freedom, lies
      principally in the following: first, these bodies of representatives of
      our propertied classes (particularly the landed aristocracy) forever
      contrapose elected institutions to the bureaucracy, give rise to constant
      conflicts between them, expose at every step the reactionary character of
      the irresponsible tsarist officialdom, and foster discontent and
      opposition to the autocratic

    



      government.[20]

      Secondly, the Zemstvos, attached to the bureaucratic chariot like a
      superfluous fifth wheel, strive to consolidate their position, to increase
      their significance, and to obtain a constitution by
      petitioning—“unconsciously march to wards it”, as Witte
      himself puts the matter. For that reason they are unsuitable as allies of
      the government in its fight against the revolutionaries; they maintain a
      benevolent neutrality towards the latter and render them undoubted, if
      indirect, service by causing the government to waver in its measures of
      repression at critical moments. Of course, institutions, which hitherto
      have proved that they are, at best, capable of making only liberal
      petitions and maintaining benevolent neutrality, cannot be regarded as an
      “important”, or to any degree an independent, factor in the
      political struggle; but it cannot be denied that the Zemst vos represent
      one of the auxiliary factors in the struggle. In this sense we
      are even prepared, if you will, to regard the Zemstvo as a piece of
      constitution. Perhaps the reader will say, “Then you agree with
      Mr. R. N. S., who does not claim any more for them?” Not at all. It is
      only here that our difference with him begins.
    

      Let us admit for the sake of argument .that the Zemstvo is a piece of
      constitution. But it is precisely such a piece that was used to
      decoy Russian “society” away from a constitution. It is
      precisely such a relatively unimportant position that the autocracy has
      yielded to growing democracy in order to retain its hold on its principal
      positions, in order to divide and disunite those who demanded political
      reforms. We have seen how this policy of disuniting on the basis of
      “confidence” in the Zemstvo (“the embryo of a
      constitution”) succeeded in the sixties and in the years 1880-81. The
      question of the relation of the Zemstvos to politi8cal freedom is a
      particular case of the general question of the relation of reforms to
      revolution. This particular case serves to illustrate the
      narrow-mindedness and stupidity of the fashionable theory of

      Bernstein,[46]

      which substitutes reforms for revolutionary struggle and declares (e.g.,

    

      through the mouth of Mr. Berdyaev) that the “principle of progress
      is that the better things are, the better”. This principle in its
      general form is as untrue as its reverse that the worse things are, the
      better. Revolutionaries, of course, will never reject the struggle for
      reforms, the struggle to capture even minor and unimportant enemy
      positions, if these will serve to strengthen the attack and help
      to achieve full victory. But they will never forget that sometimes the
      enemy himself surrenders a certain position in order to disunite the
      attacking party and thus to defeat it more easily. They will never forget
      that only by constantly having the “ultimate aim   in view, only by
      appraising every step of the “movement” and every reform from
      the point of view of the general revolutionary struggle, is it possible to
      guard the movement against false steps and shameful mistakes.
    

      It is this aspect of the question—the significance of the Zemstvo as
      an instrument for strengthening the autocracy through
      half-concessions, as a means of bringing over a certain section of the
      liberals to the side of the autocracy— that Mr. R. N. S. has
      completely failed to understand. He has preferred to invent for his own
      use a doctrinaire scheme by which the Zemstvos and the constitution are
      connected by the straight-line “formula”, the better things
      are, the better. “If you first abolish the Zemstvos in Russia,” he
      says, addressing himself to Witte, “and then increase the rights of
      the individual, you will lose the good opportunity of giving the country a
      moderate constitution growing historically out of local self-government
      with a social-estate appearance. At all events you will render the cause
      of conservatism a distinct disservice.” What a beautiful and harmonious
      conception! Local self-government with a social-estate tinge—a wise
      conservative, having access to the throne—a moderate
      constitution. The unfortunate thing about it is that in actual practice,
      the wise conservatives have on more than one occasion, thanks’ to the
      Zemstvos, found “good opportunities” to withhold the
      constitution from the country.
    

      Mr. R. N. S.’s peaceful “conception” had its effect also on
      the slogan with which he concludes his essay and Which is printed in the
      manner of a slogan, as a separate line and

    

      in heavy type: “Rights, and an Authoritative All-Russian Zemstvo!”
      It must be frankly acknowledged’ that this is the same sort of indecent
      flirting with the political prejudices of the broad masses of Russian
      liberals as Rabochaya Mysl’s flirting with the political
      prejudices of the broad masses of the workers. We are duty-bound to raise
      a protest in the first as in the second case against such flirting. It is
      prejudice to believe that the government of Alexander II did not cut off
      the legal road to liberty, that the Zemstvos provide a good opportunity
      for granting a moderate constitution to the country, and that the slogan,
      “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo” can serve as the banner
      of, we shall not say the revolutionary, but even the constitutional,
      movement. This is not a banner that can serve to distinguish. enemies from
      allies, or help to direct and guide the movement; it is but a rag that can
      only help the most unreliable characters to creep into the movement, and
      assist the government to make still another attempt to come off with
      high-sounding promises and indecisive reforms. One need not be a prophet
      to be able to prophesy this. Our revolutionary movement will reach its
      apogee, the liberal ferment in society will increase tenfold, and other
      Loris-Melikovs and Ignatyevs will appear in the government and inscribe on
      their banner: “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo”. But if
      it came to pass, it would be the most unfavourable outcome for Russia and
      the most favour able for the government. If any considerable section of
      the liberals put their faith in that banner, and, allowing themselves to
      be carried away by it, attack the revolutionary “hotheads” in
      the rear, the latter may find themselves cut off, and the government will
      try to restrict itself to a minimum of concessions limited to something in
      the nature of an advisory and aristocratic constitution. Whether this
      attempt will be successful or not, depends upon the outcome of the
      decisive struggle between the revolutionary proletariat and the
      government; but of one thing we may be certain—the liberals will be
      betrayed. With the aid of slogans like those advanced by
      Mr. R. N. S. (“Authoritative Zemstvo”, etc.), the government
      will decoy them like puppies away from the revolutionaries, only to take
      them by the scruff of the neck and thrash them with the whip

    

      of reaction. And when that happens, gentlemen, we will not forget to say,
      Serves you right!
    

      Why, instead of a demand for the abolition of absolutism, is such a
      moderate and chastened wish put forward as ultimate slogan? First, for the
      sake of the philistine doctrinairism that desires to render a
      “service to conservatism” and believes that the government
      will be softened by such moderation and be rendered
      “submissive” by it. Secondly, in order to “unite the
      liberals”. Indeed, the slogan “Rights, and an Authoritative
      Zemstvo” can perhaps serve to unite all liberals in the
      same way as (in the opinion of the “Economists”) the slogan
      “add a kopek to each

      ruble”[21]

      will unite all the
      workers. But will not such unity be a loss rather than a gain?
      Unity is an advantage when it raises those who are united to the level of
      the class-conscious and decisive programme of the unifying force. Unity is
      a disadvantage when it lowers the unifying force to the level of the
      prejudices of the masses. Among Russian liberals there is undoubtedly a
      widespread prejudice that the Zemstvo is indeed the “embryo of a

      constitution”,[22]

      the “natural”, peaceful, and gradual growth of which is
      accidentally retarded

    

      by the intrigues of certain immoral time-servers, that only a few
      petitions are necessary in order to bring the autocrat to
      “submission”, that legal cultural work generally and Zemstvo
      work in particular have “considerable political significance”,
      relieving those who mouth verbal hostility to the autocracy of the
      obligation actively to support the revolutionary struggle against the
      autocracy in one way or another, and so forth, and so on. Undoubtedly, it
      would be very useful and desirable to unite the liberals; but the unity
      must be one whose purpose is to combat outworn prejudices and not to play
      up to them, to raise the general level of our political development (or
      rather underdevelopment), and not to sanction it—in a word, it must
      be a unity for the purpose of supporting the illegal struggle and not for
      the purpose of opportunistic phrase-mongering about the great political
      significance of legal activity. If there can be no justification for
      issuing to the workers the political slogan “Freedom to
      Strike”, etc., then, by the same token, there can be no
      justification for issuing to the liberals the slogan “An
      Authoritative Zemstvo”. Under the autocracy every kind of
      Zemstvo, however “authoritative” it may be, will inevitably be
      a deformity, incapable of development, while under a
      constitution the Zemstvo will immediately lose its present-day
      “political” significance.
    

      The unification of liberals is possible in two ways: by forming an
      independent liberal party (illegal, of course), or by organising liberal
      aid for revolutionaries. Mr. R. N. S. himself points to the first form,
      but ... if what he says in this connection is to be taken as a genuine
      expression of the views and prospects of liberalism, then it does not give
      grounds for very great optimism. He writes: “Without a Zemstvo, the
      Zemstvo liberals will have to form a liberal party or abandon the
      historical stage as an organised force. We are convinced that the
      organisation of liberals in an illegal party, even if its programme and
      its methods are very moderate, will be the inevitable result of the
      abolition of the Zemstvo." If that is the case, we shall have to wait a
      long time, for even Witte does not wish to abolish the Zemstvos, and as
      for the Russian Government it is very much concerned with preserving their
      outward form, even if their content is completely eliminated. That a
      liberal

    

      party will be a very moderate one is quite natural, and it is useless to
      expect that the movement among the bourgeoisie (for only on that movement
      can a liberal party be based) will give rise to any other. But what should
      be the activities and the “methods” of such a party?
      Mr. R. N. S. does not explain. He says: “An illegal liberal party,
      being an organisation consisting of the most moderate and least mobile of
      the opposition elements, cannot by itself develop a particularly
      extensive, or particularly intensive, activity....” We think, however,
      that in a certain sphere, although limited by local and above all by
      Zemstvo interests, the liberal party could very well develop an extensive
      and intensive activity, such as the organisation of political
      exposures.... “But with such activity on the part of other parties,
      especially the Social-Democratic or working-class party, the liberal
      party, even without entering into any direct agreement with the
      Social-Democrats, can become a highly important factor....” Very true; and
      the reader will naturally expect that the author would, at least in
      general outline, describe the work of this “factor”. But
      instead of doing so, Mr. R. N. S. describes the growth of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy and concludes: “With the existence of a pronounced
      political movement ... a liberal opposition, if it is in the least
      organised, can play an important political role; with proper tactics, a
      moderate party always stands to gain from an accentuated struggle between
      extreme social elements....” That is all! The “role” of the
      “factor” (which has already managed to convert it self from a
      party into an “opposition”) is to “take advantage” of
      the growing acuteness of the struggle. Mention is made of what the
      liberals stand to gain, but not a word is said about the liberals taking
      part in the struggle. The slip of the tongue, one may say, is
      providential....
    

      The Russian Social-Democrats never closed their eyes to the fact that the
      political liberties for which they are first and foremost fighting will
      benefit primarily the bourgeoisie. Only a socialist steeped in
      the worst prejudices of utopianism, or reactionary Narodism, would for
      that reason object to carrying on the struggle against the autocracy. The
      bourgeoisie will benefit by these liberties and rest on its
      laurels—the proletariat, however, must have, freedom

    

      in order to develop the struggle for socialism to the utmost. And
      Social-Democracy will persistently carry on the struggle for liberation,
      regardless of the attitude of the various strata of the bourgeoisie
      towards it. In the interests of the political struggle, we must support
      every opposition to the oppressive autocracy, no matter on what grounds
      and in what social stratum it manifests itself. For that reason, we are by
      no means indifferent to the opposition expressed by our liberal
      bourgeoisie in general, and by our Zemstvo liberals in particular. If the
      liberals succeed in organising themselves in an illegal party, so much the
      better. We shall welcome the growth of political consciousness among the
      propertied classes; we will support their demands, we will endeavour to
      work so that the activities of the liberals and the Social-Democrats
      mutually supplement each

      other.[23]

      But even if they fail to do so (which is
      more probable), we shall not give them up as lost, we will endeavour to
      strength en contacts with individual liberals, acquaint them with our
      movement, support them by exposing in the labour press all the despicable
      acts of the government and the local authorities, and try to induce them
      to support the revolutionaries. Such an exchange of services between
      liberals and Social-Democrats is already proceeding; it must be extended
      and made permanent. But while always ready to carry on this exchange of
      services, we will never, under any circumstances, cease to carry on a
      determined struggle against the illusions that are so widespread in the
      politically undeveloped Russian society generally and among Russian
      liberals in particular. Paraphrasing the celebrated statement of Marx in
      regard to the Revolution of i848, we may say of the Russian revolutionary
      movement that its progress lies, not so much in the achievement of any
      positive gains, as in emancipation from harmful

      illusions.[47]
    

      We have emancipated ourselves from the illusions of anarchism and Narodnik
      socialism, from contempt for politics, from the belief in the
      exceptionalist development of Russia, from the conviction that the people
      are ready for revolution, and from the theory of the seizure of power and
      the duel-like combat between the autocracy and the heroic intelligentsia.
    

      It is time our liberals emancipated themselves from the illusion,
      theoretically untenable, one might assume, yet very tenacious in practice,
      that it is still possible to hold parley with the Russian autocracy, that
      some kind of Zemstvo is the embryo of a constitution, and that the sincere
      adherents of the constitution can fulfil their vow of Hannibal by patient
      legal activity and by patient appeals to the enemy to turn submissive.

      reaction.... “Early in 1862 the social atmosphere was extremely
      tense; the slightest incident could have given a strong impetus to the
      course of events in either direction. The impetus was given by the great
      conflagrations that occurred in St. Petersburg in May of that year.” These
      fires first broke out on May 16 and raged with particular
      fierceness on May 22 and 23—on the latter date there were five
      conflagrations. On May 28, the Apraksin Place [a market-place in
      St. Petersburg named after its owner, Count Apraksin.—Tr.]
      caught fire and a wide area surrounding it was laid waste. The populace
      attributed these fires to the students, and the rumours were taken up by
      the newspapers. The manifesto To Young Russia, proclaiming a
      bloody war against the whole existing system and justifying every means to
      this end, was taken to confirm the rumours of incendiarism. “After
      May 28, something in the nature of martial law was proclaimed in
      St. Petersburg.” A special committee was established with powers to take
      extraordinary measures for the protection of the capital. The
      city was divided into three zones, each under the control of a military
      governor. A field court martial was set up to try those accused of
      incendiarism.

      Sovremennik[52]

      and Russkoye

      Slovo[53]

      were suspended for eight months;

      Dyen,[54]

      published by Aksakov, was
      suppressed. Stringent temporary press regulations (sanctioned on May 12,
      i.e., before the fires broke out; consequently, “the
      progress of events” was towards reaction and was unrelated to
      the fires, the opinion of Mr. Panteleyev notwithstanding) and regulations
      for the surveillance of printing locations were resorted to. Numerous
      political arrests were made (Chernyshevsky and N. Serno-Solovyevich,
      Rymarenko, and others); Sunday schools and public reading-rooms were
      closed; permits for public lectures in St. Petersburg

   

      became more difficult to obtain; and the second department of the Literary

      Fund[55]

      and even the Chess

      Club[56]

      were closed down.
    

      The Committee of Inquiry failed to establish any connection between the
      fires and politics. One of its members, Stolbovsky, told Mr. Panteleyev
      that in the Committee “he succeeded in exposing the principal false
      witnesses who, it seems, were the cat’s-paw of police agents”
      (325-26). Thus, there are weighty grounds for believing that the rumours
      about student incendiarism were circulated by the police. The
      despicable exploitation of the ignorance of the people for the purpose of
      slandering revolutionaries and protesters was, therefore, in full swing at
      the height of the “epoch of great reforms”.

      We quote from the German translation of Dragomanov’s edition of the
      correspondence of K. D. Kavelin and I. S. Turgenev with A. I. Herzen:

      Th. Schiemann, Stuttgart, 1894, Bd. 4, S. 65-66.

[11]

      There is “no doubt” that the author of the Memorandum in
      employing the language of Leroy-Beaulien, commits the usual bureaucratic
      exaggeration. There is “no doubt” that neither Lanskoi nor
      Milyutin had anything very definite in mind, and it is ridiculous to
      regard the evasive phrases of Milyutin (“in principle in favour of
      the Constitution, but regards its introduction as premature”) as a
      “first step”.

      Dragomanov said in all justice: “As a matter of fact, liberalism In
      Russia cannot employ absolutely ’peaceful means’, because every
      declaration in favour of changing the higher administration is prohibited
      by law. The Zemstvo liberals should have stepped resolutely over the
      bounds of this prohibition, and in this way at least have demonstrated
      their strength to both the government and the terrorists. As the Zemstvo
      liberals did not demonstrate this strength, they lived to see the day when
      the government revealed its intention to destroy the already truncated
      Zemstvo institutions” (ibid., pp. 41-42).

      As we have seen the author of the Memorandum most care fully copies from
      illegal pamphlets and admits that “the underground press and the
      literary works published abroad quite correctly judged the position on this
      question from their point of view” (p. 91). The only thing
      original produced by this learned Russian “political scientist”
      is a certain amount of raw material; he has had to borrow all the fundamental
      points of view regarding political questions in
      Russia from underground literature.

      “The economic organisations of the workers,” says Mr. R. N. S. in
      another passage,"Will serve as a school for the real political education
      of the working masses." We would advise our author to be more careful in
      employing the term “real”, which has been worn thin by the
      knights of opportunism. It cannot be denied that under certain conditions
      their economic organisations may help the workers very considerably in
      their political training (no more than it can be denied that under other
      circumstances they may help in their political demoralisation). But the
      masses of the workers can obtain real political training only by
      their participation in all aspects of the revolutionary movement,
      including open street fighting and civil war against the defenders of
      political and economic slavery.

      As to what may be expected from the Zemstvo, it may not be
      without interest to quote the following opinion expressed by Prince
      P. V. Dolgorukov in his

      Listok,[57]

      published in the sixties (Burtsev, op. cit., pp. 64-67): “In
      examining the main regulations governing the Zemstvo institutions, we
      again come across the selfsame secret thought of the government, which
      continually breaks out into the light, viz., to overwhelm with generosity,
      to proclaim loudly, ’See how much I am giving you!’—yet to give as
      little as possible, and even to impose restrictions upon the enjoyment of
      the little that is given.... Under the present autocratic system, the
      Zemstvo institu tions do not and cannot bring any benefits, and will not
      and cannot have any significance, but they are rich in the seeds of
      fruitful development in the future.... New Zemstvo institutions may well
      be destined to serve as the basis for the future constitutional order in
      Russia.... But as long as Russia lacks a constitutional system of
      government, as long as the autocracy exists, and as long as freedom of the
      press is denied, the Zemstvo institutions will be doomed to remain
      political phantoms, mute assemblies of those who should voice the
      interests of the people." Thus, even in the sixties, Dolgorukov was not
      very optimistic. The forty years that have passed since then have taught
      us much and have demonstrated that the Zemstvos were destined by
      “fate” (and partly by the government) to serve as the basis
      for a series of measures to overwhelm the constitutionalists.
    —Lenin

      The present writer had occasion to point out the utility of a liberal
      party four years ago, in commenting upon the Narodnoye Pravo

      Party.[58]

      See The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats (Geneva, 1893,
      p. 26): "... If, however, the party [Narodnoye Pravo] also contains
      not masquerade, but real non-socialist politicians, non- socialist
      democrats, then this party can do no little good by striving to draw
      closer to the political opposition among our bourgeoisie (See present
      edition, Vol. 2, p. 345.—Ed.)

“The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of
  Liberalism” is a criticism of the confidential Memorandum,
  “The Autocracy and the Zemstvo”, written by the tsarist
  minister S.Y. Witte and published abroad illegally, and of the preface
  to it written by the liberal P. B. Struve.
      

Lenin’s article occasioned serious disagreement among the editors of
Iskra, Plekhanov and several other members of the Editorial
Board expressing themselves against it.
      

The polemic over the article which the Board members conducted in their
correspondence lasted about a month. Lenin accepted some suggestions to
alter certain particular formulations, but emphatically refused to
modify the sharp tone of exposure and the direction of the
article.
    



[48]

Zarya (Dawn)—a Marxist scientific and
      political magazine published in Stuttgart in 1901-02 by the Iskra
      Editorial Board.
    

      The following articles of Lenin were published in Zarya:
      “Casual Notes”, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the
      Hannibals of Liberalism”, the first four chapters of “The
      Agrarian Question

   

and the ‘Critics of Marx’\thinspace” (published tinder the title
      “The ’Critics’ on the Agrarian Question”), “Review of Home
      Affairs”, “The Agrarian Programme of Russian
      Social-Democracy”. Altogether four numbers (in three issues)
      appeared: No. 1—April ’1901 (actually on March 23, new style);
      Nos. 2-3—December 1901, and No. 4—August 1902.

Emerged from Serf Dependence” signed by Alexander II on
February 19, 1861, together with the Manifesto announcing the abolition
of serfdom.
    



[49]

Kolokol (The Bell)—a revolutionary periodical
      published under the motto of Vivos voco! (I call on the living!)
      by A. I. Herzen and N. P. Ogaryov from July 1, 1857 to April 1865, in
      London and from 1865 to December ’1868, in Geneva. In 1868 the periodical
      was published in French with a supplement in Russian. Kolokol was
      published in an edition of 2,500 copies and spread throughout Russia. It
      exposed the tyranny of the autocracy, the plunder and embezzlement of the
      civil servants, and the ruthless exploitation of the peasants by the
      landlords.
    

Kolokol was the leading organ of the revolutionary uncensored
      press and the precursor of the working-class press in Russia; it played an
      important role in the development of the general-dem ocratic and
      revolutionary movement, in the struggle against the autocracy and against
      serfdom.
    

La Revue des deux mondes (Review of the Two
      Worlds)—a French bourgeois-liberal monthly published in Paris
      from 1829 to 1940. It began as a literary and art journal, but
      subsequently began to devote considerable space to philosophy and
      politics. Some of the most eminent writers contributed to the
      review—- among them Victor Hugo, George Sand, Honoré de
      Balzac, and Alexandre Dumas. Since 1948 it has been published under the
      title La Revue. Literature, histoire, arts et sciences des deux mondes
      (The Review. The literature, history, arts and sciences of the two
      worlds).




[50]

Katkov, M. N.—reactionary journalist. From 1851 he edited
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder). He was a rabid opponent,
      not only of the revolutionary movement, but of all social progress.
    



[26]

Civil mediator—an administrative office instituted by the
      tsarist government at the time of the implementation of the ’Peasant
      Reform” of 1861. The civil mediators, appointed by the governor from
      among the local nobility, were empowered to investigate and render
      decisions on conflicts between peasants and land lords that occurred
      during the implementation of the “Regulations” on the
      emancipation of the peasants; they were actually intended to be protectors
      of the interests of the ruling classes. The chief function of the civil
      mediators was to draw up “title

   

      deeds” which gave the precise dimensions of the peasants’ allotments
      and their location, as well as details of the obligations of the peasants;
      the mediators were also charged with the supervision of peasant local
      self-government bodies. The mediators approved the elected officials of
      the peasant administration, had the right to impose penalties upon them,
      to arrest or fine them, and to annul the decisions of village meetings.
    

      In this passage Lenin refers to the liberal-minded civil mediators in Tver
      Gubernia, who refused to implement the “Regulations” and who
      decided to be guided in their work by the decisions of the Assembly of the
      Nobility in their gubernia; this Assembly, in February 1862, had formally
      recognised the unsatisfactory nature of the “Regulations” and
      the necessity for the immediate redemption of peasant lands with state
      aid, as well as the introduction of a number of democratic
      institutions. The Tver civil mediators were arrested by the tsarist
      government and each was sentenced to over two years’ imprisonment.

Raznochintsi (i.e., “men of different estates”)—the
      Russian commoner-intellectuals, drawn from the small townsfolk, the
      clergy, the merchant classes, the peasantry, as distinct from those drawn
      from the nobility.
    



[28]

To Young Russia—a proclamation issued by
      P. G. Zaichnevaky’s revolutionary group in May 1862. The proclamation
      called for revolutionary action against the autocracy and advanced the
      slogan for a social and democratic Russian republic” in the form of
      a federation of the regions.
    



[29]

Chernyshevsky, N. G. (1828-1889)—the great Russian
      revolutionary democrat, materialist philosopher, scholar, critic, and
      author; the leader of the revolutionary movement in the sixties of the
      past century. In 1862 Chernyshevsky was arrested and sentenced to 14
      years’ penal servitude and exile for life in Siberia; he was allowed to
      return only in 1883. Chernyshevsky had a tremendous influence on the
      development of Russian progressive social thought.
    



[51]

At the Glorious Post—a collection published by the
      Narodniks to commemorate forty years of literary and social activity
      (1860-1900) of the Narodnik ideologist N. K. Mikhailovsky.
    



[52]

Sovremennik (The Contemporary)—a monthly
      scientific, political, and literary journal founded by Alexander Pushkin;
      published in St. Petersburg from 1836 to 1866. From 1847 it was published
      by N. A. Nekrasov and I. I. Panayev. Among the contributors were
      V. G. Belinsky, N. G. Chernyshevsky, M. A. Dobrolyubov, N. V. Shelgunov,
      M. Y. Saltykov-Shchedrin, and M. A. Antonovich. Sovremennik was
      the most progressive journal of its day; it voiced the aspirations of
      revolutionary democracy. It was closed down by the tsarist government in
      1866.
    



[53]

Russkoye Slovo (Russian Word)—a prominently
      progressive literary and political monthly published in St. Petersburg
      from 1859 to 1866; among its contributors were D. I. Pisarev and

      Writers and Scientists and Their Families)—a legal benevolent
      society founded in St. Petersburg in 1859 with the participation of
      N. G. Chernyshevsky. Under the pretext of helping indigent writers and
      scientists, the organisers made an attempt to muster the progressive,
      revolutionary-minded section of the intelligentsia. In April 1862 an
      attempt was made by progressives to establish a legal student society
      through the founding of a “Department for Aid to Poor
      Students”. The Department was headed by a student committee. A
      considerable section of the committee was connected with the illegal
      revolutionary organisation Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom). In June 1862
      the Department was closed by the tsarist government.
    



[56]

The Chess Club was founded on the initiative of
      N. G. Chernyshevsky and his closest associates in St. Petersburg in
      January 1862. Among the leading members of the Club were N. A. Nekrasov,
      the brothers A. A. and N. A. Serno-Solovyevich, the brothers V. S. and
      N. S. Kurochkin, P. L. Lavrov, G. Y. Blagosvetlov, G. Z. Yeliseyev, and
      N. G. Pomyalovsky. Members of the illegal Zemlya i Volya organisation also
      belonged to the Club. The Chess Club was actually a literary club, the
      centre of the St. Petersburg revolutionary-minded intelligentsia. In June
      1862 the Club was closed by the Tsarist government.
    



[30]

Radishchev, A. N. (1749-1802)—-Russian writer and
      revolutionary. In his famous work A Journey from St. Petersburg to
      Moscow, he made the first open attack on serfdom in Russia. By order
      of Catherine If he was sentenced to death for the book, but the sentence
      was commuted to 10 years’ exile in Siberia, He returned from exile under
      amnesty, hut when the tsarist government threatened him with new
      persecutions he committed suicide. Lenin considered Radishchev to have
      been one of the most out standing champions of progress among the Russian
      people.
    



[31]

Arakcheyev, A. A—reactionary tsarist statesman at the end
      of the eighteenth and the beginning of nineteenth centuries; he greatly
      influenced home and foreign policies during the reigns of Paul I and
      Alexander I. An epoch of unlimited police despotism and the outrages of
      the controlling military is associated with his name
      (“Arakcheyevshchisia”).
    



[32]

The Decembrist Revolt—led by a group of revolutionaries
      from the nobility who opposed the autocracy and serfdom.
    



[33]

      Lenin refers to the participation of the troops of Tsar Nicholas I in the
      suppression of the revolutionary movement in Europe in 1848-49
      particularly the revolution in Hungary in 1849.
    



[34]

États généraux (The States
      General)—a representative hody of the social-estates of France
      from the fourteenth to the eighteenth cen tury, consisting of deputies
      from the nobility, the clergy, and the Third Estate; it was convened by
      the king for the settlement of administrative and financial questions. The
      States General were not convened for 175 years—from 1614 to
      1789. When they were convened in 1789 by Louis XVI for the purpose of
      settling the financial crisis, the hody was proclaimed as the National
      Assembly by a decision of the deputies representing the Third Estate.

      democrat, materialist philosopher, publicist, and author. p. 42
    



[36]

General Vannovsky, appointed Minister of Education in 1901, made
      use of liberal phrases such as “love” and “heartfelt
      solicitude” for the student youth, with the aim of quietening the
      student disturbances. After introducing a numher of insignificant reforms
      in the sphere of education, he resorted to renewed repressive measures
      against the revolutionary students—arrests, banishment, expulsions
      from universities, etc.
    



[37]

Volnoye Slovo (Free Word)—a weekly,, and from
      No. 37 a fort-nightly, periodical published in Geneva from 1881 to 1883;
      alto gether 62 issues appeared. Volnoye Slovo claimed to have as
      its pur pose the unification of opposition elements and propagated liberal
      ideas on the need to reform the Russian social system on “principles
      of freedom and self-government”. Actually it was founded with the
      knowledge of the secret police by members of the Holy Guard (a secret
      organisation promoted by the biggest landed nobility and high government
      officials, headed hy Prince A. P. Shuvalov and others) for purposes of
      political provocation. Volnoye Slovo was edited by the police
      agent A. P. Malshinsky.
    

      At the end of 1882 the Holy Guard collapsed and Volnoye Slovo,
      beginning with No. 52 (January 8, 1883), was edited by M. P. Dra gomanov;
      it claimed to be the organ of the Zemstvo League, which did not exist as a
      permanent and properly-constituted organisation.

      highest representatives of the privileged social-estates of France
      convened by King Louis XVI in 1787 and 1788 to settle the country’s
      financial

   

crisis. The Assembly refused to pass an ordinance taxing the
      priv ileged social-estates and Louis XVI was forced to convene the States
      General.
    



[40]

Dictatorship of the heart—the name given ironically to the
      short-lived policy of flirting with the liberals, pursued by the tsarist
      official Loris-Mehikov, who, in 1880, was appointed chief of the Supreme
      Administrative Commission to combat “sedition” and, later,
      Minister of the Interior.
    



[41]

Sotsial-Demokrat (Social-Democrat)— a
      literary-political review published abroad by the Emancipation of Labour
      group in the period 1890-92. Altogether four issues appeared.
    

      Lenin quotes an article by Vera Zasulich entitled ’Revolution aries from
      the Bourgeois Milieu”, published in No. I for 1890.
    



[42]

Narodnaya Volya (The People’s Will)—a secret
      Narodnik terrorist organisation, whose members carried out the
      assassination of Alexander II, on March 1, 1881; it came into being in
      August. 1879, following the split in the secret society Zemlya i Volya
      (Land and Freedom). The Narodnaya Volyn was headed by an Executive
      Committee which included A. I. Zhelyabov, A. D. Mikhailov, M. F. Frolenko,
      N. A. Morozov, V. N. Figner, S. L. Perovskaya, and A. A. Kvyatkovsky. The
      immediate aim of the Narodnaya Volya was the overthrow of the tsarist
      autocracy while its programme provided for the establishment of a
      “permanent popular representative body” elected on the basis
      of universal suffrage, the proclamation of democratic liberties, the
      transfer of land to the people, and the elaboration of measures for the
      factories to pass into the hands of the workers. The Narodnaya Volya,
      however, was unable to find the road to the masses of the people and took
      to political conspiracy and individual terror. The terrorist struggle of
      the Narodnaya Volya was not supported by a mass revolutionary movement;
      this enabled the government to crush the organisation by fierce
      persecution, death sentences, and provocation.
    

      After 1881 the Narodnaya Volya ceased to exist as an
      organisation. Repeated attempts to revive it, made during the 1880s ended
      in failure. An instance was the terrorist group that was formed in 1886,
      headed by A. I. Ulyanov (Lenin’s brother) and P. Y. Shevyrev; after an
      unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Alexander Ill the group was exposed
      and its active members were executed.
    

      Although he criticised the erroneous, utopian programme of the Narodnaya
      Volya, Lenin showed great respect for the selfless struggle waged by its
      members against tsarism. In 1899, in “A Protest by Russian
      Social-Democrats”, Lenin stated that “the members of the old
      Narodnaya Volya managed to play an enormous role in the history of Russia,
      despite the fact that only narrow social strata supported the few heroes,
      and despite the fact that it was by no means a revolutionary theory which
      served as the banner of the movement” (see present edition, Vol. 4,
      p. 181).

Land redemption payments were fixed by the
      “Regulations Governing Redemption by Peasants Who Have Emerged from
      Serf Dependence”, approved on February 19, 1861. The tsarist
      government compelled peasants to pay redemption money for the land
      allotted to them at a rate several times higher than the actual value of
      the land. Upon the conclusion of the redemption deal, the government paid
      a sum of money to the landlord as redemption money, which sum was regarded
      as a debt to be repaid by the peasant in annual instalments over a period
      of 49 years. The “land redemption payments” were unbearably
      burdensome for the peasants and led to mass ruin and
      pauperisation. Peasants who had formerly been landlord’s serfs alone paid
      a sum of about 2,000 million rubles to the tsarist government, while the
      land they received was not worth more than 544 million rubles. Since the
      deals did not take effect immediately, but at various times up to 1883,
      the payments were to have continued until 1932. The peasant movement at
      the time of the First Russian Revolution (1905-07), however, compelled the
      tsarist government to cancel the land redemption payments as from January
      1907.

Rural superintendent—an office instituted by the tsarist
      government in 1889 to increase the power of the landlords over the
      peasantry. The rural superintendents, appointed from among the local
      landed nobility, were granted tremendous powers, not only administrative,
      but juridical, which included the right to arrest peasants and order
      corporal punishment.

      “Separate Supplement” to Rabochaya
      Mysl—a pamphlet published by the editors of the
      “Economist” newspaper Rabochaya Mysl in September
      1899. The pamphlet, especially the included article “Our
      Reality”, signed R. M., was a candid exposé of the
      opportunist views of the “Economists”. Lenin criticised the
      pamphlet in his article “A Retrograde Trend in Russian
      Social-Democracy” (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 255-85), and in
      his book What Is To Be Done? (see present volume, pp. 361-67,
      397, 407-08).
    



[46]

Bernsteinism—an anti-Marxist trend in international
      Social-Democracy which arose in Germany at the end of the nineteenth
      century and derived its name from the German Social-Democrat Eduard
      Bernstein. Bernstein set out to revise the revolutionary teachings of Marx
      in the spirit of bourgeois liberalism.
    

      In Russia Bernsteinism had its adherents in the “legal
      Marxists”, the “Economists”, the Bundists, and the
      Mensheviks. p. 73
    



[57]

Listok (Small Paper)—a monthly newspaper of
      constitutional liberal views published illegally abroad by Prince
      P. V. Dolgorukov. Altogether twenty-two numbers were issued between
      November 1862 and July 1864. The first five numbers were issued in
      Brussels, the others in London.
    



[58]

Narodnoye Pravo (People’s Right) Party—an underground
      organisation of the democratic intelligentsia formed in 1893, with the

   

      assistance of ex-members of the Narodnaya Volya (M. A. Natanson
      and others), and crushed by the tsarist government in the spring of
      1894. The Narodnoye Pravo issued two programmatic documents “An
      Urgent Question” and “Manifesto”. Most of the Narodnoye
      Pravo members subsequently joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party.

      Labour unrest has once again been the subject of intense and widespread
      comment. The governing circles are alarmed, in all earnestness
      alarmed. This is evident from the fact that it was deemed necessary to
      “punish”, by suspension for a week, even Novoye

Vremya,[1]

      that
      arch-loyal newspaper ever fawning on the authorities, for an article published
      in issue No. 9051 of May 11, entitled “Apropos of the Labour
      Unrest”. Of course, the penalty was not inflicted because of the contents
      of the article, which was replete with the warmest appreciation of the
      government and the sincerest concern for its interests. What was considered
      dangerous was the very discussion of events that were “disturbing
      society”, the mere reference to their extensiveness and their
      importance. Below we give extracts from the secret circular (also dated
May 11)[2]

      directing that press articles dealing with the disorders in the factories
      and with the workers’ attitude towards the employers be published only
      by permission of the Department of Police, which proves better than
      all arguments that the government itself is inclined to regard the labour
      unrest as a matter of state importance. The article in Novoye
      Vremya is of particular interest precisely for the reason that it
      outlines a complete state programme, which in effect amounts to allaying
      the discontent by a few petty and in part fictitious doles to which are
      attached pompous sign boards about protective policy, cordiality, etc.,
      and which provide pretexts for increasing surveillance by government
      officials. But this programme, which is not a new one, embodies, one may
      say, the “acme” of wisdom of modern statesmen, not only in
      Russia, but also in the West. In a

    

      society based on private property and the enslavement of millions of
      propertyless toilers by a handful of rich people, the government cannot be
      anything but the loyal friend and ally of the exploiters and the most
      reliable guardian of their power. In our times, guns, bayonets, and whips
      are not a sufficiently reliable guardian; it is necessary to convince the
      exploited that the government stands above classes, that it does not serve
      the interests of the aristocracy and the bourgeiosie, but those of
      justice, that it is concerned with protecting the weak and the poor
      against the rich and the powerful, etc. Napoleon III in France and
      Bismarck and Wilhelm II in Germany exerted no little effort to play up to
      the workers in this way. But in Europe, where there is a more or less free
      press, a representative government, electoral campaigns, and
      well-established political parties, all these hypocritical tricks were
      quickly exposed. In Asia, however, which includes Russia, where the masses
      of the people are so wretched and ignorant, and where there are such
      strong prejudices fostering faith in Our Father the Tsar, tricks of this
      kind are quite successful. One of the very characteristic signs that the
      European spirit is beginning to penetrate into Russia is the
      failure with which this policy has met in the last ten or twenty
      years. Over and over again it was tried, but each time, within a few years
      after the enactment of some “protective” (allegedly
      protective) labour law, there was a reversion to the old state of
      affairs—the number of discontented workers increased, ferment grew,
      unrest gained in scope—again the “protective” policy was
      announced with a blare of trumpets, again pompous phrases could be heard
      about heartfelt solicitude for the workers; another law was passed
      providing a penny’s worth of benefit and a pound’s worth of empty and
      lying words for the workers, and in a few years’ time the whole business
      was repeated. The government was as frantic as a squirrel in a cage, and
      went to any lengths, in one form or another, to stop up the gaps with sops
      and shreds; but the discontent broke out in ever newer places with
      increasing vigour.
    

      Let us recall the outstanding points in the history of “labour
      legislation” in Russia. Towards the end of the seventies there were big
      strikes in St. Petersburg, and the socialists tried to take advantage of the
      situation to intensify

    

      their agitation. Alexander III included factory legislation in his
      so-called “popular” (but in fact aristocratic-police)
      policy. In 1882 the Factory Inspectorate was introduced and at first its
      reports were even published. The government, of course, was not pleased
      with these reports and ceased their publication. The factory
      inspection laws proved to be merely a stopgap. Then came the years
      1884-85; the industrial crisis gave rise to a powerful movement among the
      workers, and there were a number of turbulent strikes in the central
      district (the Morozov cotton-mill

      strike[3]

      being particularly
      noteworthy). Again the “protective” policy was brought to the
      fore, this time advocated with particular zeal by Katkov in
      Moskovskiye

Vedomosti.[4]

      Katkov fumed and raged over the fact that
      the Morozov strikers were tried by a jury, and he described the hundred
      and one questions submitted by the court for the jury’s decision as
      “a hundred-and-one gun salute in honour of the appearance of the
      labour question in Russia”; but, at the same time, he demanded that
      the “state” come to the defence of the workers and prohibit
      the monstrous system of fines that had ultimately aroused the Morozov
      cotton weavers to revolt. The law of 1886 was passed; it greatly widened
      the powers of the Factory Inspectorate and prohibited the imposition of
      arbitrary fines to benefit the employers. Ten years passed, and again
      there was an outbreak of labour unrest. The strikes of 1895, particularly
      the great strike of

      1896,[5]

      caused the government to tremble with fear
      (especially on account of the fact that the Social-Democrats were by then
      regularly marching shoulder to shoulder with the workers); with
      unprecedented celerity, it passed the “protective” law (June
      2,1897) for a shorter working day. During the discussion of the projected
      law in committee the officials of the Ministry of the Interior, including
      the director of the Department of Police, declared loudly that the factory
      workers must come to regard the government as their constant protector and
      their just and merciful patron (see the pamphlet The Secret Documents
      on the Law of June 2,

1897[6]).

      Although passed, the protective law is
      being cur tailed and rendered ineffective on the sly through circulars
      issued by the selfsame government. Another industrial crisis sets in. The
      workers for the hundredth time are

    

      convinced that the “protection” of the police government
      cannot substantially alleviate their conditions, or give them liberty to
      look after themselves; again unrest and street fighting, again the
      government is anxious, again we hear police speeches about “state
      protection”, this time proclaimed in Novoye Vremya.
      Gentlemen! Will you never tire of scooping up water with a sieve?
    

      No, the government, of course, will never tire of repeating its attempts
      to intimidate the irreconcilable workers and decoy the weaker, the more
      foolish, and more cowardly, by means of a dole. Nor will we ever tire of
      exposing the real meaning of these attempts and of exposing
      “statesmen” who-but yesterday ordered soldiers to shoot down the
      workers and today are shouting about protection; who but yesterday talked
      about their justice and their patronage of the workers and today are
      seizing the best of the workers and intellectuals, one after another, and
      leaving them to the mercy of the police without trial. Therefore we
      consider it necessary to dwell on the “state programme” of
      Novoye Vremya in good time before some new
      “protective” law is promulgated. Moreover, the admissions made
      in this connection by a publication so “authoritative” in the
      sphere of home politics as Novoye Vremya are worthy of attention.
    

Novoye Vremya is compelled to admit that the “regrettable
      manifestations in the sphere of the labour question” are not
      accidental. Of course, the socialists, too, are responsible (the newspaper
      avoids mentioning the awful word “socialist”, preferring such
      vague terms as “pernicious pseudo-doctrines” and the
      “propaganda of anti-state and anti-social ideas”); but ... but why
      are the socialists so successful among the workers? Novoye
      Vremya, of course, does not miss an opportunity to hurl abuse at the
      workers: they are so “undeveloped and ignorant” that they
      willingly listen to the pernicious propaganda of the socialists, so
      harmful to the welfare of the police. Consequently, the socialists and the
      workers are to blame, and the gendarmes have long been waging a desperate
      war against the guilty, filling the prisons and places of exile. But to no
      avail. Apparently, there is something in the conditions of the factory
      workers which “engenders and fosters discontent with their
      present conditions” and thus “favours the success” of
      socialism.

    

      "The severe toil of the factory workers in extremely unfavourable
      conditions of life provides them with a bare subsistence for as long as
      they are able to work, and in every emergency when they are without work
      for any length of time, they find themselves in desperate straits, as, for
      example, the workers in the Baku oil fields described recently in the
      newspapers.” Government supporters, thus, are compelled to admit that the
      success of socialism is due to the really bad conditions of the
      workers. But the admission is made in such a vague and evasive form, and
      with such reservations, that it is clear that people of this sort cannot
      possibly have the slightest intention of touching the “sacred
      property” of the capitalists which oppresses the
      workers. “Unfortunately,” writes Novoye Vremya, “we
      know too little about the actual state of affairs in regard to the labour
      question in Russia.” Yes, unfortunately indeed! And “we” know
      little, precisely because we permit the police government to keep the
      whole press in slavery, to gag every one who honestly attempts to expose
      the- scandalous state of affairs in our country. But “we” do
      try to turn the working man’s hatred riot against the Asiatic government
      but against the non-Russians. Novoye Vremya broadly hints at the
      “non Russian factory managers”, and calls them “coarse
      and greedy”. Such a bait is likely to trap only the most ignorant
      a-nd undeveloped workers, those who believe that all their misfortunes
      come from the “Germans” or the “Jews” and who do
      not know that the German and the Jewish workers unite to fight their
      German and Jewish exploiters. But even the workers who do not know this
      have learned from thousands of examples that the Russian capitalists are
      the “greediest” and most unceremonious of all capitalists, and
      that the Russian police and the Russian Government are the
      “coarsest” of all.
    

      Of interest, too, are Novoye Vremya’s regrets that the workers
      are no longer so ignorant and submissive as is the peasantry. The paper
      bewails the fact that the workers “are abandoning their rural
      nests”, that the “factory districts become the gathering
      centres of mixed masses”, that the “villagers are abandoning
      their villages with their modest [that is the heart of the matter I, but
      independent, social and economic interests and
      relationships”. Indeed, they

    

      have something to bewail. “The villagers” are tied to their
      nests, and out of fear of losing them, dare not submit demands ·to
      their landlord, to threaten him with strikes, etc. The villagers do not
      know conditions in other places and are interested only in the affairs of
      their own hamlet (the supporters of the government call this the
      “independent interests” of the villager; knowing his place,
      not poking his nose into politics—what can please the authorities
      more?); but in this hamlet, the local leech, the landlord or the kulak,
      knows every single individual; the peasants have all inherited from their
      fathers and grandfathers the servile lesson of submission, and there is no
      one there to awaken consciousness in them. In the factory, however, the
      people are “mixed”, are not tied to their nests (it is all the
      same to them where they work), they have seen and ]earned things, and are
      hold and full of interest in every thing that is going on in the world.
    

      Notwithstanding this deplorable transformation of the humble muzhik into a
      class-conscious worker, our police wiseacres still hope to delude the
      working masses with phrases about “the state’s protection of the
      workers’ welfare”.  Novoye Vremya fortifies this hope with the
      following out worn argument: “Capitalism, proud and all-powerful in
      the West, is still an infant in our country, it can walk only in leading
      strings, and these are provided by the government.  Now, only a humble
      peasant will believe this old song about the omnipotence of the
      authorities! The worker, however, sees all too often that the capitalists
      keep the police, the church, and the military and civil officials
      in leading strings”. And so, continues Novoye Vremya, the
      government “must insist” upon an improvement in the
      workers’ conditions, i.e., it must demand this improvement of the
      employers. Simple, is it not? Issue an order, and, presto, the thing is
      done. But it is easy to talk; in point of fact, the orders of the
      authorities, even the most “modest”, such as the establishment
      of hospitals at the factories, have been ignored by the capitalists for
      whole decades. Moreover, the government would not dare to order the
      capitalists to do anything that would seriously affect the
      “sacred” right of private property. Furthermore, the
      government wants no serious improvement in the conditions of the workers,
      because in

    

      thousands of instances it is an employer itself and under-pays and
      oppresses the workers in the Obukhov Works and in hundreds of other
      places, as well as tens of thousands of postal and railway employees,
      etc., etc. Novoye Vremya, realising that no one would take the
      orders of our government seriously, tries to bolster up its position with
      lofty historical examples. This should be done, it says in regard to the
      improvement in the conditions of the workers, “in the same way as
      half a century ago, when the government took the peasant question in hand,
      when it was guided by the wise conviction that it would be better, through
      reforms from above, to avert the presentation of demands for such reforms
      from below and not to wail for such an eventuation”.
    

      Now, this is really a valuable admission. Before the emancipation of the
      peasants, the tsar indicated to the nobility the possibility of a popular
      rebellion, saying that it would be better to emancipate from above than to
      wait until they began to emancipate themselves from below. And now this
      cringing newspaper admits that the mood of the workers fills it with a
      fear no less than did the mood of the peasants “on the eve of
      freedom”. “Better from above than from below”! The
      autocracy’s newspaper lackeys are profoundly mistaken if they think there
      is a “similarity” between the demands for reforms today and
      those of that time. The peasants demanded the abolition of serfdom,
      having nothing against the tsar’s rule and believing in the tsar. The
      workers today are revolting first and foremost against the government;
      they realise that their lack of rights under the police autocracy binds
      them hand and foot in their struggle against the capitalists and for that
      reason they demand liberation from governmental tyranny and governmental
      outrage. The workers are also in a state of unrest “on the eve of
      freedom”, but this will be the liberation of the whole people, which
      is wresting political freedom from the despots.
    
 *     *  * 

      Do you know what great reform is proposed in order to hush the discontent
      of the workers and to demonstrate to them the “state’s protection”?
      If persistent rumour is to be believed, a struggle is going on between the
      Ministry of

    

      Finance and the Ministry of the Interior. The latter demands that the
      Factory Inspectorate be placed under its control; for then, it argues, the
      factory inspectors will be less likely to indulge the capitalists and will
      show more regard for the interests of the workers and in this way avert
      unrest. Let the workers prepare for this new act of the tsar’s grace; the
      factory inspectors will don different uniforms and they will be placed on
      the staff of another ministry (in all probability with a rise in salary),
      the very ministry, indeed (especially the Department of Police), which for
      such a long time past has been demonstrating its love and solicitude for
      the workers.
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]

Novoye Vremya (New Times)—a St. Petersburg
      newspaper published from 1868 to October 1917. At first moderately
      liberal, it be came after 1876 the organ of the most reactionary circles
      of the nobility and the state bureaucracy. The paper conducted a struggle,
      not only against the revolutionary, but also against the
      bourgeois-liberal, movement. From 1905 onwards it became an organ of the
      Black Hundreds.
    



[2]

      The circular referred to was sent out by the Central Press Board to all
      newspaper and magazine editors after Novoye Vremya published the
      article “Apropos of the Labour Unrest”. The circular was
      reproduced in Iskra, No. 6 (July 1901) in the article
      “St. Petersburg” (section “From Our Social Life”).
    



[3]

      The strike movement of 1885 involved many textile enterprises in Vladimir,
      Moscow, Tver, and other gubernias of the industrial centre of Russia. The
      January strike of the workers at the Nikolskoye Mill, near
      Orekhovo-Zuyevo, belonging to Morozov, was the biggest and had the
      greatest significance. The principal demands of the strikers were the
      reduction of fines, the introduction of a regular hiring system, etc. The
      strike was led by the advanced workers P. Moiseyenko, L. Ivanov, and
      V. Volkov. The Morozov strike, in which over 8,000 workers took part, was
      crushed by tsarist troops and over 600 workers were arrested. Under
      pressure of the strike movement of 1885-86, the tsarist government was
      forced to issue a law on fines (the Law of June 3, 1886), according to
      which fine-moneys were to be used for the needs of the workers and were
      not to go into the employer’s pocket.
    



[4]

Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder)—a
      newspaper founded in 1756; beginning with the 1860s, it expressed the
      views of the most reactionary monarchist elements among the landlords and
      the clergy; from 1905 onwards, it was one of the chief organs of the Black
      Hundreds. It continued publication until the October Revolution of 1917.
    



[5]

      Lenin refers to mass strikes of St. Petersburg workers, mainly in the
      textile industry, in 1895 and, particularly, 1896. The 1896 strike began
      on the Kalinkin Cotton-Spinning Mill on May 23. The immediate cause of the
      strike was the employers’ refusal to pay the

   

      workers in full for holidays on the occasion of the coronation of Nicholas
      II. The strike spread rapidly to all the main cotton-spinning and weaving
      mills of St. Petersburg, and then to large machine-building plants, a
      rubber factory, a paper factory, and a sugar refinery. For the first time
      the proletariat of the capital launched a struggle against its exploiters
      on a broad front. Over 30,000 workers went on strike. The strike was
      conducted under the leadership of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle
      for the Emancipation of the Working Class, which issued leaflets and
      manifestos calling on the workers to stand solid and steadfast in defence
      of their rights; the League published and distributed the strikers’ main
      demands, which included the ten-and-a-half-hour working day, increased
      rates of pay, and payment of wages on time.
    

      The report of the strike produced a tremendous impression abroad. The
      Berlin Vorwarts (Forward) and the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung
      (Workers’ Gazette) carried accounts of the strike. An address from
      English workers, signed by the leaders of all socialist and trade-union
      organisations, was translated into Russian and distributed by the League
      of Struggle among the St. Petersburg workers. At a meeting of London trade
      unions a report on the strike by Vera Zasulich and a speech by Eleanor
      Marx-Aveling were greeted with great enthusiasm and the audience took up a
      collection to aid the strikers; similar collections were taken up in other
      trade unions. Collections for the St. Petersburg strikers were organised
      in Ger many, Austria, and Poland. The London Congress of the Second
      International, which took place in July 1896, cheered Plekhanov’s report
      of the 1896 strike and adopted a special resolution greeting the Russian
      workers who were “struggling against one of the last bastions of
      European reaction”.
    

      The St. Petersburg strikes gave an impetus to the working-class movement
      in Moscow and other Russian cities; they forced the government to speed up
      the review of the factory laws and to issue the Law of June 2 (14), 1897
      limiting the working day at all factories and mills to eleven and a half
      hours. The strikes, as Lenin subsequently wrote, “ushered in an era
      of steady advance in the working-class movement, that most powerful factor
      in the whole of our revolution” (see present edition, Vol. 13,
      “Preface to the Collection Twelve Years”).

      The pamphlet The Secret Documents on the Law of June 2, 1897 was
published in Geneva in 1898 by the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
Abroad.

      The commercial and industrial crisis has already dragged on for almost two
      years. Apparently it is still growing, spreading to new branches of
      industry and to new districts, and is becoming more acute as a result of
      the failure of more banks. Every issue of our newspaper since last
      December has in one form or another shown the development of the crisis
      and its disastrous effects. The time has come to raise the general
      question of the causes and the significance of this phenomenon. For
      Russia, it is a comparatively new phenomenon, as new as Russian
      capitalism. In the old capitalist countries—i.e., in the countries
      where the greatest part of the goods is produced for sale, and where the
      majority of the workers own neither land nor tools, but sell their
      labour-power to employers, to the owners of property, to those to whom the
      land, the factories, the machinery, etc., belong—in the capitalist
      countries, crises are an old phenomenon, recurring from time to time, like
      attacks of a chronic disease. Hence, crises may be predicted, and when
      capitalism began to develop with particular rapidity in Russia, the
      present crisis was predicted in Social-Democratic literature. The pamphlet
      The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats, written at the end of
      1897, stated: “We are apparently now passing through the period in
      the capitalist cycle [a rotation, in which the same events repeat
      themselves like summer and winter] when industry is ’prospering’, when
      business is brisk, when the factories are working at full capacity, and
      when countless new factories, new enterprises, joint-stock companies,
      railway enterprises, etc., etc., are springing up like mushrooms. One need
      not be a prophet to foretell the inevitable and fairly sharp crash

    

      that is bound to succeed this period of industrial ’prosperity’. This
      crash will ruin masses of small owners, will throw masses of workers into
      the ranks of the

      unemployed...."[1]

      And the crash came with a severity unparalleled in Russia. What is the
      cause of this horrible, chronic disease of capitalist society, which
      recurs so regularly that its coming can be forecast?
    

      Capitalist production cannot develop otherwise than by leaps and
      bounds—two steps forward and one step (and sometimes two) back. As
      we have said, capitalist production is production for sale, the production
      of commodities for the market. Production is conducted by individual
      capitalists, each producing on his own and none of them able to say
      exactly what kind and what amount of commodities will be required on the
      market. Production is carried on haphazardly; each producer is concerned
      only in excelling the others. Quite naturally, therefore, the quantity of
      commodities produced may not correspond to the market demand. This
      probability becomes particularly great when the enormous market is
      suddenly extended to new huge, unexplored territories. This was precisely
      the situation at the beginning of the industrial “boom” we
      experienced not so long ago. The capitalists of all Europe stretched out
      their paws towards that part of the globe inhabited by hundreds of
      millions of people, towards Asia, of which until recently only India and a
      small section of the coastal regions had been closely connected with the
      world market. The Transcaspian Railway began to “open up”
      Central Asia for the capitalists; the “Great Siberian Railway”
      (great, not only because of its length, but because of the unrestricted
      plunder of the Treasury by the contractors and the unrestricted
      exploitation of the workers who built it) opened up Siberia. Japan began
      to develop into an industrial nation and strove to make a breach in the
      Chinese Wall, opening the way to a choice morsel into which the
      capitalists of England, Germany, France, Russia, and even Italy
      immediately plunged their teeth. The construction of gigantic railways,
      the expansion of the world market, and the growth of commerce, all
      stimulated an unexpected revival of industry, an increase of new

    

      enterprises, a wild hunt for commodity markets, a hunt for profits, the
      floating of new companies, and the attraction to industry of masses of
      fresh capital, which consisted partly of the small savings of small
      capitalists. It is not surprising that this wild world-hunt for new and
      unknown markets led to a terrific crash.
    

      To obtain a clear idea of the nature of this hunt for markets and profits,
      we must remember what giants took part in it. When we speak of
      “separate enterprises” and “individual
      capitalists”, we sometimes forget that, strictly speaking, these
      terms are inexact. In reality, only the appropriation of profit has
      remained individual but production itself has become social. Gigantic
      crashes have become possible and inevitable, only because powerful
      social productive forces have become subordinated to a gang of
      rich men, whose only concern is to make profits. We shall illustrate this
      by an example from Russian industry. Recently the crisis has spread to the
      oil industry, in which such enterprises as the Nobel Brothers Oil Company
      are engaged. In 1899 the company sold 163,000,000 poods of oil products to
      the value of 53,500,000 rubles, while in 1900 it sold 192,000,000 poods to
      the value of 72,000,000 rubles. In one year, a single enterprise increased
      the value of its output by 18,500,000 rubles! This “single
      enterprise” is maintained by the combined labour of tens and
      hundreds of thousands of workers engaged in extracting oil and refining
      it; in delivering it by pipeline, railways, seas, and rivers; and in
      making the necessary machinery, warehouses, materials, lighters, steamers,
      etc. These tens of thousands of workers work for the whole of society, but
      their labour is controlled by a handful of millionaires, who appropriate
      the entire· profit earned by the organised labour of this mass of
      workers. (In 1899 the Nobel Company made a net profit of 4,000,000 rubles,
      and in 1900 the figure was 6,000,000 rubles, of which the shareholders
      received 1,300 rubles per 5,000-ruble-share, with five members of the
      board of directors receiving bonuses to the amount of 528,000
      rubles!) When several such enterprises fling themselves into the wild
      chase for a place in an unknown market, is it surprising that a crisis
      sets in?
    

      Furthermore, for an enterprise to make profit, its goods must be sold,
      purchasers must be found. The purchasers

    

      of these goods must comprise the entire population, because these colossal
      enterprises produce whole mountains of goods. But nine-tenths of the
      population of all capitalist countries are poor; they are workers who
      receive extremely miserable wages and peasants who, in the main, live even
      worse than the workers. Now, when, in the period of a boom, the large
      industrial enterprises set out to produce as vast a quantity of goods as
      possible, they flood the market with such a huge quantity of goods that
      the majority of the population, being poor, cannot pay for them. The
      number of machines, tools, warehouses, railroads, etc., continues to
      grow. From time to time, however, this process of growth is interrupted be
      cause the masses of the people for whom, in the last analysis, these
      improved instruments of production are intended, remain in a state of
      poverty that verges on beggary. The crisis shows that modern society could
      produce immeasurably more goods for the improvement of the living
      conditions of the entire working people, if the land, factories,
      machines, etc., had not been seized by a handful of private owners, who
      extract millions of profits out of the poverty of the people. The crisis
      shows that the workers should not confine themselves to the struggle for
      individual concessions from the capitalists. While industry is in upswing,
      such concessions may be won (the Russian workers on more than one occasion
      between 1894 and 1898 won concessions by energetic struggle); but when the
      crash comes, the capitalists not only withdraw the concessions they made,
      but take advantage of the helpless position of the workers to force wages
      down still lower. And so things will inevitably continue until the army of
      the socialist proletariat over-throws the domination of capital and
      private property. The crisis shows how near-sighted were those socialists
      (who call themselves “Critics”, probably because they borrow
      uncritically the doctrines of the bourgeois economists) who two years ago
      loudly proclaimed that crashes were becoming less and less probable.
    

      The lessons of the crisis, which has exposed the absurdity of subordinating
      social production to private, property, are so instructive that even the
      bourgeois press is now demanding stricter supervision—e.g., over the
      banks. But no supervision will prevent the capitalists from setting up

    

      enterprises in times of boom which must inevitably become bankrupt later
      on. Alchevsky, the founder of a land and a commercial bank in Kharkov,
      both now bankrupt, acquired millions of rubles by fair means or foul for
      the purpose of establishing and maintaining mining and metallurgical
      enterprises that promised wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. A hitch in
      industry wrecked these banks and mining and metallurgical enterprises (the
      Donets-Yuryev Company). But what does the “crash” of
      enterprises mean in capitalist society? It means that the smaller
      capitalists, capitalists of the “second magnitude”, are
      eliminated by the big millionaires. The place of Alchevsky, the Kharkov
      millionaire, is taken by the Moscow millionaire, Ryabushinsky, who, being
      a richer capitalist, will bring greater pressure to bear on the
      workers. The supplanting of smaller capitalists by big capitalists, the
      increased power of capital, ruination of masses of small property-owners
      (e.g., small investors, who lose all their property in a bank crash), the
      frightful impoverishment of the workers—all this is brought about by
      the crisis. We recall also cases described in Iskra of
      capitalists lengthening the working day and discharging class-conscious
      workers in an effort to replace them by more submissive people from the
      villages.
    

      The effect of the crisis in Russia is, in general, ever so much greater
      than in any other country. Stagnation in industry is accompanied by famine
      among the peasantry. Unemployed workers are being sent out of the towns to
      the villages, but where can the unemployed peasants be sent? By sending
      the workers to the villages, the authorities desire to clear the cities of
      the discontented people; but perhaps those sent out will be able to rouse
      at least part of the peasantry from its age-long submission and induce it,
      not only to request, but to demand. The workers and peasants are
      being drawn closer to each other, not only by unemployment and hunger, but
      also by police tyranny, which deprives the workers of the possibility of
      uniting to defend their own interests and prevents even the aid of
      well-disposed people from reaching the peasantry. The heavy paw of the
      police is becoming a hundred times heavier for the millions of people who
      have lost all means of livelihood. The gendarmes and the police in the
      towns, the rural superintendents

    

      and the village policemen in the rural districts, see clearly that hatred
      against them is growing, and they are beginning to fear, not only the
      food-kitchens, set up in the villages, but even advertisements in the
      newspapers appealing for funds. Afraid of voluntary contributions! In
      truth, the thief fears his own shadow. When the thief sees a passer by
      offering alms to the man he has robbed, he begins to think that the two
      are shaking hands in a pledge to settle accounts with him.

On June 8, 1901, a law was adopted governing the grants of state lands
in Siberia to private persons. How this new law will be applied, the
future will show; but its character is so instructive, it so strikingly
demonstrates the undisguised nature and the real strivings of the
tsarist government, that it should be analysed thoroughly and made known
as widely as possible among the working class and the peasantry.
      

Our government has long been granting doles to the noble, aristocratic
landlords. It established for them the Nobles’ Bank, it granted them all
sorts of privileges in obtaining loans and relief in the payment of
arrears, it helped them to arrange a strike of the millionaire
sugar-refiners in order to raise prices and increase their profits; it
took care to provide the ruined sons of the aristocracy with soft jobs
as rural superintendents, and it is now arranging for the government
purchase of vodka on very favourable terms for the noble
distillers. However, in making grants of state lands, it not only makes
gifts to the richest and most aristocratic exploiters, but creates a
new class of exploiters and dooms millions of peasants and
workers to permanent bondage to new landlords.
      

Let us examine the principal features of the new law. It must be
observed, first of all, that before its introduction in the Council of
State by the Minister of Agriculture and State Property, the law was
discussed at a special conference on the affairs of the
nobility. It is generally known that in Russia today it is not the
workers and peasants, but the noble landlords who suffer most from
poverty, and so this “special conference” hastened to devise
measures by which

    

      their poverty might be relieved. State lands in Siberia will be sold and
      leased to “private persons” for the purpose of “private
      enterprise”; but foreigners and non-Russian subjects of the tsar
      (the Jews included among the latter) are prohibited for ever from
      acquiring these lands in any way. The lands may be leased (and we shall
      see that this is the most advantageous transaction for the future
      landlords) only to nobles, “who”, as the law states,
      “owing to their economic reliability, are the most desirable
      landowners to have in Siberia from. the standpoint of the
      government”. Thus, the standpoint of the government is that the
      labouring population must be enslaved to the big landed aristocracy. How
      big can be seen from the fact that salable allotments may not exceed
      three thousand dessiatines, while no limit at all is placed on
      the amount of land leased, and the term of the leases may be for a period
      up to ninety-nine years! According to the government’s
      calculations, a poor landlord needs two hundred times as much
      land as a peasant, who is given fifteen dessiatines of land in Siberia for
      himself and his family.
    

      The easy terms and the exceptions to the rule which the law provides for
      the landlords are truly astounding. The lessee pays nothing for the first
      five years. If he purchases the land he has leased (which right
      the new law gives him), payment is spread over a period of thirty-seven
      years. With special permission, an area of land exceeding 3,000
      dessiatines may be set aside for sale, land may be sold at agreed prices
      arid not by auction, while arrears may be postponed for one or even three
      years. It must not be forgotten that generally only the higher dignitaries
      and persons with court connections, etc., will take advantage of the new
      law—and such people will obtain these easy terms and the
      exemptions quite casually, in the course of a drawing-room conversation
      with a governor or a minister.
    

      But there’s the rub! Of what use are these bits of land, three thousand
      dessiatines in area, to the landowning generals if there is no
      “muzhik” forced to work for these generals? However rapidly poverty
      is increasing among the people in Siberia, the local peasant is nevertheless
      much more in dependent than the “Russian” peasant and he has not
      been trained to work under the bludgeon. The new law is intended

    

      to train him. “The lands appointed for private enterprises
      shall, as far as possible, be divided into lots alternating with
areas held by the peasant allotment holders”, says Article 4
      of the new law. The tsarist government displays its solicitude for the
      poor peasants and tries to provide “means of livelihood” for
      them. Ten years ago, the same Mr. Yermolov who now, as Minister of
      Agriculture and State Property, has introduced into the Council of State
      the new Siberian land law providing for the disposal of state lands to
      private persons, wrote a book (anonymously) entitled The Crop
Failure and the Distress of the People. In that work he openly
      declared that there was no reason for permitting peasants who could
      obtain “a livelihood” from their local landlords to migrate
      to Siberia. Russian statesmen do not hesitate to express purely feudal
      views; peasants were created to work for the landlords, and peasants,
      therefore, must not be “permitted” to migrate to a place of
      their choice, if thereby the landlords will be deprived of cheap
      labour. And when, despite all the difficulties, the red tape, and even
      the downright prohibition, the peasants still continued to migrate to
      Siberia in hundreds of thousands, the tsarist government, acting like
      the steward of an old-time manorial lord, hastened after them to work
      them to exhaustion in their new habitations. If, however,
      “alternating” with the puny peasant

      allotments[1]

      and peasant lands (the best of which are already occupied), there will be
      lots of three thousand dessiatines belonging to the noble landlords, then
      all temptation to migrate to Siberia will disappear very soon. The more
      cramped the conditions of the surrounding peasants become, the more the
      new landlords’ land will increase in value; the peasants will be obliged
      to hire themselves out cheaply, or lease land from the landlords at
      exorbitant rates—just as in “Russia”. The new law sets
      out precisely to create as quickly as possible a new paradise for the
      landlords and a new hell for the peasants; there is a special clause on
      the leasing of land for a single season. While special permission
      is required to sublease state lands, it is permitted quite

    

      freely for one season. All that the landlord need trouble about is to
      engage a steward, who will sublease land by the dessiatine to the peasants
      living on the allotments “alternating” with the landlord’s
      land, and send his master the net profit.
    

      Probably many nobles will not care to carry on even such an
      “enterprise”. In that case, they can make a nice little pile
      at one stroke by reselling the state land to real farmers. It is no
      accident that the new law has been timed with the construction of
      a railroad in Siberia, when banishment to Siberia has been abolished, and
      when migration to Siberia has increased to an enormous extent; all this
      will inevitably lead (and is already leading) to a rise in land
      values. Hence, the granting of state lands to private persons at the
      present time is nothing more nor less than plunder of the Treasury by the
      nobles. The state lands are rising in value, but they are being leased or
      sold on highly advantageous terms to generals and people of that stripe,
      who will benefit by the rising prices. In Ufa Gubernia, for instance, in
      one uyezd alone, the nobles and officials made the following transaction
      in land sold to them (on the basis of a similar law): they paid the
      government 60,000 rubles for the land and within two years sold it for
      580,000 rubles, obtaining for the mere resale more than half a million
      rubles! From this instance we can imagine the millions of rubles that
      will pass into the pockets of the poverty-stricken landlords thanks to the
      land grants throughout Siberia.
    

      With all sorts of lofty arguments the government and its adherents seek to
      cover up this naked robbery. They talk about the development of culture in
      Siberia, and of the enormous importance of model farms. As a matter of
      fact, the large estates, which place the neighbouring peas ants in a
      hopeless position, can at the present time serve only to develop the most
      uncultured methods of exploitation. Model farms are not established by
      robbing the Treasury, and the grant of lands will lead simply to land
      speculation among the nobles and officials, or to farming methods in which
      bondage and usury will flourish. The noble aristocrats, in alliance with
      the government, have prohibited Jews and other non-Russians (whom they try
      to present to the ignorant people as particularly outrageous exploiters)
      from acquiring state lands in Siberia, in order

    

      that they may themselves engage in the worst type of exploitation
      without hindrance.
    

      There is talk also of the political significance of having the
      social-estate of landed nobility in Siberia; among the intelligentsia, it
      is said, there is a very large number of former exiles, of unreliable
      people there, who need to be counterbalanced by the establishment of a
      reliable support of the state, a reliable “local”
      element. This talk contains a greater and profounder truth than

      Grazhdanin[2]

      and Moskovskiye Vedomosti
      imagine. The police state is arousing so much hostility against itself
      among the masses that it finds it necessary artificially to create groups
      that can serve as pillars of the fatherland. It is essential for the
      government to create a class of big exploiters, who would be under
      obligation to it for everything and dependent upon its grace, who would
      make enormous profits by the most despicable methods (speculation and
      kulak exploitation), and, consequently, could always be relied upon to
      support every tyranny and oppression. The Asiatic government must find
      support in Asiatic large landownership, in a feudal system of
      “granting lands”. And if it is not possible at present to
      grant “populated estates”, it is possible at all events to
      grant estates alternating with the lands of peasants who are
      becoming more and more destitute. If it is not convenient simply to grant
      thousands of dessiatines of land gratis to the Court lickspittles, it is
      possible to cover up this wholesale bestowal of lands by their sale or
      “leasing” (for 99 years) that is attended by
      thousands of privileges. When we compare this land policy with that of
      modern progressive countries like America, for example, can we call it
      anything else but feudal? In America, no one would dare talk
      about permitting or not permitting migration; for in that country, every
      citizen has the right to go where he pleases. In that country every one
      who desires to engage in farming has the right by law to occupy
      vacant land in the outlying parts of the country. In America, they are not
      creating a class of Asiatic satraps, but a class of energetic farmers who
      have developed the productive forces of the country. Thanks to the
      abundant free land there, the working class in America enjoys the highest
      standard of living in the world.

    

    

      And what a period our government has chosen for passing this serf-owners’
      law! It is a period of the most acute industrial crisis, when tens and
      hundreds of thousands are unemployed, when millions of peasants are again
      suffering from famine. The government has exerted all its efforts to
      prevent the disaster from being given “publicity”. That is why
      it has sent the unemployed workers back to their village homes; that is
      why it has transferred food distribution from the Zemstvos to the police
      officials; that is why it has prohibited private persons from organising
      food-kitchens for the famine-stricken; and that is why it has gagged the
      press. But when the famine “publicity”, so unpleasant to the
      ears of the well-fed, died down, Our Father the Tsar set to work. to
      assist the poverty-stricken landlords and poor unfortunate courtier
      generals. We repeat, our task at the present time is simply to bring the
      contents of this new law to the knowledge of all. As they become
      acquainted with it, the most undeveloped sections of the workers, and the
      most backward and downtrodden peasants, will understand whom the present
      government serves and what kind of government the people must have.

      The wave of excitement among the general public that spread over the
      country after the events of this spring is not receding. It makes itself
      felt in one form or another among all sections of Russian society, a
      society that as recently as January of this year seemed to be deaf and
      alien to the purposive work of Russian Social-Democracy. The government is
      bending its every effort to calm the troubled public conscience as quickly
      as possible with the usual soap bubbles such as the Manifesto of March 25
      on “heart felt protection”, such as the so-called Vannovsky
      Reforms or the Sipyagin and

      Shakhovskoi[1]

      solemn buffoon tours of Russia.... Some of the more naive among the
      general public will actually be calmed by such measures, but by far not
      all. Even the present-day Zemstvo people, about fifty per cent of whom are
      scared civil servants, seem to be coming out of the state of chronic
      trepidation to which they were reduced in the now historical stagnant
      epoch of the “Peacemaker-Tsar”.
    

      His Majesty the Bureaucracy, having now shed its crude covering of
      modesty, is arousing feelings of discontent and disgust even among the
      Zemstvos, among those timid people in whom civic courage and civic
      morality are almost completely atrophied.
    

      We have been informed that in the city of X (for precaution, to remain
      unnamed) a congress of Zemstvo members was called at the end of June. It
      is said to have been attend ed by 40 or 50 Zemstvo people from several
      gubernias.
    

      These people did not, of course, assemble to discuss political questions,
      but to solve peaceable, purely Zemstvo problems; they gathered
      “without infringing the bounds of

    

      the department and the extent of their authority”, as it is
      picturesquely expressed in the Zemstvo Instructions (Article 87). The
      meeting, however, was called without the per mission and knowledge of the
      administration and, consequently, was held “in contravention of the
      Instructions for the activities of Zemstvo institutions”, to quote
      the Instructions, and the assembled Zemstvo men gradually went over from
      the discussion of peaceable, innocent questions to a discussion of the
      general state of affairs. Such is the logic of life: conscientious Zemstvo
      men, howsoever they at times denounce radicalism and illegal work, are, by
      the force of events, faced with the necessity of illegal organisation and
      a more determined form of activity. Far be it from us to condemn this
      natural and perfectly correct path. It is time, at long last, for Zemstvo
      members to give an energetic and organised rebuff to a government that has
      taken the bit between its teeth, has killed rural self-government, has
      mutilated both urban and Zemstvo self-government, and with asinine
      obstinacy lays the axe to the last remnants of the Zemstvo institutions,
      It is said that one of the elderly and respected men of the Zemstvo,
      during the discussion at the congress on the question of how to combat the
      law setting limits to taxation by the Zemstvos, exclaimed: “Zemstvo
      members must, at last, say their word; for if they don’t, they’ll never be
      able to!” We are in complete agreement with the outcry of this liberal who
      is prepared to challenge the bureaucratic autocracy to open struggle. The
      Zemstvos are on the eve of internal bankruptcy. If the best Zemstvo men do
      not to day take energetic measures, if they do not get rid of their usual

      Manilov[2]

      attitude, their trivial questions of secondary
      importance—“tinkering”, as one venerable Zemstvo man put
      it—the Zemstvos will lose their adherents and turn into the usual
      “government offices”. Such an inglorious death is inevitable;
      for one cannot with impunity for whole decades do nothing but show
      cowardice, offer thanks, and humbly petition; one must threaten, demand,
      stop wasting time on trifles, and settle down to the real work.

      “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of
      Marx’\thinspace” was
written between June and September 1901. The first four chapters were
published in the journal Zarya, Nos. 2-3, in December 1901,
under the title “the ’Critics’ on the Agrarian Question. First
Essay”; the contribution bore the signature of N. Lenin.
The chapters were later published legally in Odessa (with the
inscription “Permitted by the Censor”. Odessa, July 23,
1905) by the Burevestnik Publishers as a separate pamphlet The
Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx”, by
N. Lenin. The title was retained by the author for further publications
of the essay, in whole or in part.
    

      Chapter V-IX were first published in the legal magazine Obrazovaniye
(Education), No. 2, February 1906. They had subtitles; chapters
I-IV, published in Zarya and in the 1905 pamphlet, had none.
    

      The nine chapters with two additional ones (X and XI) were first published
      together in 1908 in St. Petersburg in The Agrarian Question, Part
      I, by V. I. Ilyin (V. I. Lenin), chapters I-IV had subtitles;
      some editorial changes were made in the text and some notes added.
    

      Chapter XII (the last) was, first printed in the collection Current
Life in 1908.
    

      The first nine chapters are included in the present volume; chapters X,
      XI, and XII, written in 1907, will appear in Volume 13 of the present
      edition of the Collected Works of V. I. Lenin.

Lenin: 1901/agrarian: The 'Law' of Diminishing Returns







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx”



    

    


 

      “... To argue ... that dogmatic Marxism has been jolted from its
      positions in the sphere of agrarian questions would be like forcing an
      open door... ." So spoke Russkoye

Bogatstvo[7]

      last year
      through the mouth of Victor Chernov (1900, No. 8, p. 204). What a peculiar
      quality this “dogmatic Marxism” possesses! For many years now
      scientists and very learned people in Europe have been gravely declaring
      (and newspaper scribes and journalists have been repeating it over and
      over again) that Marxism has been jolted from its positions by
      “criticism”, and yet every new critic starts from the
      beginning, all over again, to bombard these allegedly destroyed
      positions. Mr. Chernov, for example, in the periodical Russkoye
      Bogatstvo, as well as in the collec tion, At the Clorious
      Post, in a two-hundred-and-forty-page-long
      “discussion” of Hertz’

      work[1]

      with his reader, “forces an open door”. Hertz’ work, which has
      been given such a lengthy exposition, is itself a review of Kautsky’s
      book, and has been translated into Russian. Mr. Bulgakov, in keeping with
      his promise to refute this very same Kautsky, has published a whole
      two-volume study. Now, surely, no one will ever be able to find the
      remnants of “dogmatic Marxism”, which lies crushed to death
      beneath this mountain of critical printed matter.
    


I
The “Law” of Diminishing Returns

      Let us first of all examine the general theoretical physiognomy of the
      Critics. Mr. Bulgakov published an article in
      the periodical

      Nachalo[8]

      criticising Kautsky’s Agrarian
    

      Question in which he at once exposed his stock of
      “critical” methods. He charged down on Kautsky with the dash
      and abandon of a veritable cavalier and “scattered” him to the
      winds. He put into Kautsky’s mouth what he had not said, he accused him of
      ignoring the very circumstances and arguments which he, Kautsky, had
      expounded with precision, and he presented to the reader as his
      own the critical conclusions drawn by Kautsky. With the air of an
      expert, Mr. Bulgakov accused Kautsky of confounding technology with
      economics, and in doing so betrayed, not only incredible confusion, but
      also a disinclination to .read  to the end the page he
      quotes from his opponent’s book. Needless to say, this article from the
      pen of the future professor is replete with outworn gibes against
      socialists, against the “theory of collapse”, against
      utopianism, against belief in miracles,

      etc.[2]

      Now, in his doctoral thesis (Capitalism and Agriculture,
      St. Petersburg, 1900), Mr. Bulgakov settled all his accounts with Marxism
      and brought his “critical” evolution to its logical
      conclusion.
    

      Mr. Bulgakov makes the “law of diminishing returns” the
      corner-stone of his “theory of agrarian development”. We are
      treated to quotations from the works of the classics who established this
      “law” (according to which each additional investment of labour
      and capital in land produces, not a corresponding, but a diminishing
      quantity of products). We are given a list & the English economists
      who recognise this law. We are assured that it “has universal
      significance”, that it is “an evident and absolutely
      undeniable truth”, “which needs only to be stated
      clearly”, etc., etc. The more emphatically Mr. Bulgakov expresses
      himself, the clearer it becomes that he is retreating to
      bourgeois political economy, which obscures social relationships by
      imaginary “eternal laws”. Indeed, what does the
      “evidentness” of the notorious “law of diminishing
      returns” amount to? If each successive investment of labour and
      capital in land produced, not a diminishing, but an equal quantity of
      products,

    

      there would be no sense in extending the area of land under cultivation;
      additional quantities of grain, would be produced on the same plot of
      land, however small, and “it would be possible to carry on the
      agriculture of the whole globe upon one dessiatine of land”. This is
      the customary (and the only) argument advanced in favour of this
      “universal” law. A little thought, however, will prove to
      anyone that this argument is an empty abstraction, which ignores the most
      important thing—the level of technological development, the state of
      the productive forces. Indeed, the very term “additional (or
      successive) investments of labour and capital” presupposes
      changes in the methods of production, reforms in technique. In order to
      increase the quantity of capital invested in land to any considerable
      degree, new machinery must be invented, and there must be new
      methods of land cultivation, stock breeding, transport of products, and so
      on and so forth. Of course, “additional investments of labour and
      capital” may and do take place on a relatively small scale even when
      the technique of production has remained at the same level. In such cases,
      the “law of diminishing returns” is applicable to a
      certain degree, i.e., in the sense that the unchanged technique of
      production imposes relatively very narrow limits upon the investment of
      additional labour and capital. Consequently, instead of a universal law,
      we have an extremely relative “law”—so relative, indeed, that
      it cannot be called a “law”, or even a cardinal specific
      feature of agriculture. Let us take for granted: the three-field system,
      cultivation of traditional grain crops, maintenance of cattle to obtain
      manure, lack of improved grassland and improved implements. Obviously,
      assuming that these conditions remain unchanged, the possibilities of
      investing additional labour and capital in the land are extremely
      limited. But even within the narrow limits in which some investment of
      additional labour and capital is still possible, a decrease in the
      productivity of each such additional investment will not always and
      not necessarily be observed. Let us take industry—flour-milling
      or ironworking, for example, in the period preceding world trade and the
      invention of the steam-engine. At that level of technical development, the
      limits to which additional labour and capital could be invested in a
      blacksmith’s forge,

    

      or in a wind- or water-mill, were very restricted; the inevitable thing
      that happened was that small smithies and flour- mills continued to
      multiply and increase in number until the radical changes in the methods
      of production created a basis for new forms of industry.
    

      Thus, the “law of diminishing returns” does not at all apply
      to cases in which technology is progressing and methods of production are
      changing; it has only an extremely relative and restricted application to
      conditions in which technology remains unchanged. That is why neither Marx
      nor the Marxists speak of this “law”, and only representatives
      of bourgeois science like Brentano make so much noise about it, since they
      are unable to abandon the prejudices of the old political economy, with
      its abstract, eternal, and natural laws.
    

      Mr. Bulgakov defends the “universal law” by arguments
      deserving only of ridicule.
    

      “What was formerly a free gift of Nature must now be produced by man:
      the wind and the rain broke up the soil, which was full of nutritive
      elements, and only a little effort on the part of man was required to
      produce what was needed. In the course of time, a larger and larger share
      of the productive work fell to man. As is the case everywhere, artificial
      processes more and more take the place of natural processes. But while in
      industry this expresses man’s victory over Nature, in agriculture it
      indicates the increasing difficulties of an existence for which Nature is
      diminishing her gifts.
    

      “In the present case it is immaterial whether the increasing
      difficulty of producing food is expressed in an increase in human labour
      or in an increase of its products, such as instruments of production,
      fertilisers [Mr. Bulgakov wishes to say that it is immaterial whether the
      increasing difficulty of producing food finds expression in an increased
      expenditure of human labour or in an increase in the products of human
      labour]; what is important is that food becomes more and more costly to
      man. This substitution of human labour for the forces of Nature and of
      artificial factors of production for natural factors is the law of
      diminishing returns” (16).
    

      Evidently, Mr. Bulgakov is envious of the laurels of

    

      Messrs. Struve and Tugan-Baranovsky, who arrived at the conclusion that it
      is not man who works with the help of machines, but machines that work
      with the help of man. And like those critics, he sinks to the level of
      vulgar political economy by talking about the forces of Nature being
      superseded by human labour, and so forth. Speaking generally, it
      is as impossible for human labour to supersede the forces of Nature as it
      is to substitute pounds for yards. Both in industry and in agriculture.,
      man can only utilise the forces of Nature when he has learned how they
      operate, and he can facilitate this utilisation by means of
      machinery, tools, etc. That primitive man obtained all he required as a
      free gift of Nature is a silly fable for which Mr. Bulgakov would be
      howled down even by first-term students. Our age was not preceded by a
      Golden Age; and primitive man was absolutely crushed by the burden of
      existence, by the difficulties of the struggle against Nature. The
      introduction of machinery and of improved methods of production
      immeasurably eased man’s struggle against Nature generally, and the
      production of food in particular. It has not become more difficult to
      produce food; it has become more difficult for the workers to obtain it
      because capitalist development has inflated ground-rent and the price of
      land, has concentrated agriculture in the hands of large and small
      capitalists, and, to a still larger extent, has concentrated machinery,
      implements, and money, without which successful production is
      impossible. To explain the aggravation of the workers’ condition by the
      argument that Nature is reducing her gifts can mean only that one has
      become a bourgeois apologist.
    

      “In accepting this law,” continues Mr. Bulgakov, “we do not in
      the least assert that there is a continuously increasing difficulty in
      food production; nor do we deny progress in agriculture. To assert the
      first, and to deny the second, would be contrary to obvious facts. This
      difficulty does not grow uninterruptedly, of course; development proceeds
      in zigzag fashion. Discoveries in agronomics and technical improvements
      convert barren into fertile land and temporarily remove the tendency
      indicated by the law of diminishing returns” (ibid.).
    

      Profound, is it not?
    
 

      Technical progress is a “temporary” tendency, while the law of
      diminishing returns, i.e., diminishing productivity (and that not always)
      of additional investments of capital on the basis of an unchanging
      technique, “has universal significance”! This is equal to saying
      that the stopping of trains at stations represents the universal law of
      steam transport, while the motion of trains between stations is a
      temporary tendency paralysing the operation of the universal law of
      immobility.
    

      Finally, extensive data clearly refute the universality of the law of
      diminishing returns—data on the agricultural as well as the
      non-agricultural population. Mr. Bulgakov himself admits that “if
      each country were restricted to its own natural resources, the procuring
      of food would call for an uninterrupted relative increase [note this!] in
      the quantity of labour and, consequently, in the agricultural
      population” (19). The diminution in the agricultural population of
      Western Europe, accordingly, is explained by the fact that the operation
      of the law of diminishing returns has been counteracted by the
      importation of grain.
    

      An excellent explanation, indeed! Our pundit has forgotten a detail,
      namely, that a relative diminution in the agricultural population is
      common to all capitalist countries, both agricultural and
      grain-importing. The agricultural population is relatively diminishing in
      America and in Russia. It has been diminishing in France since the end of
      the eighteenth century (see figures in the same work of Mr. Bulgakov, II,
      p. 168). Moreover, the relative diminution of the agricultural population
      sometimes becomes an absolute diminution, whereas the excess of grain
      imports over exports was still quite insignificant in the thirties and
      forties, and only after 1878 do we cease to find years in which
      grain exports exceed grain

      imports.[3]

      In Prussia there was a relative
      diminution in the agricultural population from 73.5 per cent in 1816 to
      71.7 per cent in 1849, and to 67.5 per cent in 1871, whereas the
      importation of rye began only in the early sixties, and the importation of
      wheat in the early seventies (ibid., Part II, pp. 70 and 88). Finally, if

    

      we take the European grain-importing countries, e.g., France and Germany
      during the last decade, we shall find that there has been undoubted
      progress in agriculture side by side with an absolute
      diminution in the number of workers engaged in farming. In France
      this number dropped from 6,913,504 in 1882 to 6,663,135 in 1892
      (Statistique agricole, Part II, pp. 248.51), and in Germany from
      8,064,000 in 1882 to 8,045,000 in

      1895.[4]

      Thus, it may be said that the entire history of the nineteenth
      century, by a multitude of data on countries of the most varied character,
      proves irrefutably that the “universal” law of diminishing
      returns is absolutely paralysed by the “temporary”
      tendency of technological advance which enables a relatively (and
      sometimes absolutely) diminishing rural population to produce an
      increasing quantity of agricultural products for an increasing mass of
      population.
    

      Incidentally, this mass of statistical data also refutes the two following
      main points of Mr. Bulgakov’s “theory”: first, his assertion
      that the theory that constant capital (implements and materials of
      production) grows more rapidly than variable capital (labour-power)
      “is absolutely inapplicable to agriculture”. With an air of
      importance Mr. Bulgakov declares that this theory is wrong, and in proof
      of his opinion refers to: (a) “Professor A. Skvortsov”
      (celebrated mostly for having ascribed Marx’s theory of the average

    

      rate of profit to ill-intentioned propaganda); and (b) the fact that under
      intensive farming the number of workers employed per unit of land
      increases. This is an example of the deliberate refusal to understand Marx
      which fashionable Critics constantly display. Think of it: the theory of
      the more rapid growth of constant capital as compared with variable
      capital is refuted by the increase of variable capital per unit
      of land! And Mr. Bulgakov fails to notice that the very
      statistics he himself offers in such abundance confirm Marx’s theory. In
      German agriculture as a whole the number of workers employed diminished
      from 8,064,000 in 1882 to 8,045,000 in 1895 (and if the number of persons
      engaged in agriculture as a subsidiary occupation is added, it in creased
      from 11,208,000 to 11,623,000, i.e., only by 3.7 per cent). In the same
      period, livestock increased from 23,000,000 to 25,400,000 (all livestock
      expressed in terms of cattle), i.e., by more than 10 per cent; the number
      of cases in which the five most important agricultural machines were
      employed increased from 458,000 to 922,000, i.e., more than doubled; the
      quantity of fertilisers imported increased from 636,000 tons (1883) to
      1,961,000 tons (1892), and the quantity of potassium salts from 304,000
      double centners to

      2,400,000.[5]

      Is it not clear from this that constant
      capital has increased in relation to variable capital? This, quite apart
      from the fact that these summary figures to a great extent conceal the
      progress of large-scale production. We shall deal with this point later.
    

      Secondly, the progress of agriculture simultaneously with a diminution, or
      a negligible absolute increase, in the agricultural population completely
      refutes Mr. Bulgakov’s absurd attempt to revive Malthusianism. The first
      of the Russian “ex-Marxists” to make this attempt was probably
      Mr. Struve, in his Critical Remarks; but he, as always, never
      went beyond hesitant, half-expressed, and ambiguous remarks, which he did
      not carry to their logical conclusion or round off into a complete system
      of views. Mr. Bulgakov, however, is bolder and more consistent; he
      unhesitatingly converts the “law of diminishing returns” into
      “one of the

    

      most important laws of the history of civilisation” (sic!
      p. 18). “The entire history of the nineteenth century ... with its
      problems of riches and poverty would be unintelligible without this law.”
      “I have not the least doubt that the social question as it is posed
      today is materially linked with this law.” (Our strict scientist hastens
      to make this declaration on page 18 of his “Inquiry”!)... “There is
      no doubt,” he declares at the end of his work, “that where
      over-population exists, a certain part of the poverty that prevails must
      be put under the heading of absolute poverty, the poverty of
      production and not of distribution” (II, 221). “The population
      problem, in the special form in which it presents itself to us as a result
      of the conditions of agricultural production, is, in my opinion, the
      principal obstacle—at the present time at any rate—in the way
      of any extensive application of the principles of collectivism or
      co-operation in agricultural enterprise” (II, 265). “The past
      leaves to the future a heritage in the shape of a grain problem more
      terrible and more difficult than the social problem—the problem of
      production and not of distribution” (II, 455), and so on and so
      forth. There is no need for us to discuss the scientific significance of
      this “theory”, which is inseparably connected with the
      universal law of diminishing returns, since we have already examined this
      law. The fact that critical flirtation with Malthusianism in its logical
      development has inevitably resulted in a descent to the most vulgar
      bourgeois apologetics is proved by the above-quoted arguments, which
      Mr. Bulgakov has presented with a frankness that leaves nothing to be
      desired.
    

      In a further essay we shall examine data from several new sources cited by
      our Critics (who constantly din into our ears that orthodox Marxists fear
      specification) and show that Mr. Bulgakov generally stereotypes the word
      “over population”, the use of which relieves him of the
      necessity of making any kind of analysis, particularly of analysing the
      class antagonisms among the “peasantry”. Here we shall confine
      ourselves to the general theoretical aspect of the agrarian question and
      touch on the theory of rent. “As for Marx,” writes Mr. Bulgakov,
      “we must say that in Volume III of Capital, in the form in
      which we have it now, he adds nothing worthy of attention to Ricardo’s
      theory of differential

    

      rent” (87). Let us bear this “nothing worthy of
      attention” in mind and compare the Critic’s verdict with the
      following statement made by him previously: “Notwithstanding his
      obvious opposition to this law [the law of diminishing returns I, Marx
      appropriates, in its fundamental principles, Ricardo’s theory of rent,
      which is based on this law” (13). Thus, according to Mr. Bulgakov,
      Marx failed to see the connection between Ricardo’s theory of rent and the
      law of diminishing returns, and therefore he never carried his argument to
      its logical conclusion! In regard to such a statement we can say but one
      thing—that no one distorts Marx to the degree that the ex-Marxists
      do and no one is so incredibly un... un... unabashed in ascribing to the
      writer he is criticising a thousand and one mortal sins.
    

      Mr. Bulgakov’s assertion is a glaring distortion of the truth. Actually,
      Marx not only saw the connection between Ricardo’s theory of rent and his
      erroneous doctrine of diminishing returns, but quite definitely exposed
      Ricardo’s error. Anyone who has read Volume III of Capital with
      even a grain of “attention” could not but have observed the
      fact, very much “worthy of attention”, that it was precisely
      Marx who freed the theory of differential rent from all
      connection with the notorious “law of diminishing returns Marx
      demonstrated that the unequal productivity of different investments of
      capital in land was all that was necessary for the formation of
      differential rent. The question as to whether the transition is from
      better land to worse land or vice versa, as to whether the productivity of
      the additional investments of capital in land diminishes or increases, is
      absolutely immaterial. In actual practice, all sorts of combinations of
      these varying cases take place; and it is utterly impossible to subject
      these combinations to a single general rule. For example, Marx first of
      all describes the first form of differential rent, which arises from the
      unequal productivity of capital invested in unequal plots of land, and he
      explains his case by tables (concerning which Mr. Bulgakov severely
      rebukes Marx for his “excessive predilection for clothing what are
      often very simple thoughts in a complicated mathematical garb”. This
      complicated mathematical garb is simply the four rules of arithmetic, and
      the very simple ideas, as we see, were completely misunderstood

    

      by our learned professor). After analysing these tables, Marx draws the
      conclusion: “This takes care of the first false assumption regarding
      differential rent—still found among West, Malthus, and
      Ricardo—namely, that it necessarily presupposes a movement toward
      worse and worse soil, or an ever-decreasing fertility of the soil. It can
      be formed, as we have seen, with a movement toward better and better soil;
      it can be formed when a better soil takes the lowest position that was
      formerly occupied by the worst soil; it can be connected with a
      progressive improvement in agriculture. The precondition is merely the in
      equality of different kinds of soil ." (Marx does not speak here of
      the unequal productivity of successive investments of capital in land,
      because this gives rise to the second form of differential rent;
      in this chapter he speaks only of the first form of differential
      rent.) “So far as the increase in productivity is concerned, it
      [differential rent—Ed. I assumes that the increase in absolute
      fertility of the total area does not eliminate this inequality, but either
      increases it, leaves it unchanged, or merely reduces it” (Das
      Kapital, III, 2,

S. 199).[9]

      Mr. Bulgakov failed to see the radical difference between Marx’s
      theory of differential rent and Ricardo’s theory of rent. He preferred to
      rummage in Volume III of Capital for “a fragment which
      would rather suggest the idea that Marx was by no means opposed to the law
      of diminishing returns” (p. 1.3, footnote). We apologise to the
      reader for having to devote so much space to a passage that is quite
      immaterial to the question that concerns us and Mr. Bulgakov. But what can
      one do when the heroes of modern criticism (who have the insolence to
      charge orthodox Marxists with resorting to rabulous disputation) distort
      the absolutely clear meaning of a doctrine to which they are opposed by
      quoting passages out of context and in faulty translations? Mr. Bulgakov
      quotes the passage that he found as follows: “From the standpoint of
      the capitalist mode of production, a relative increase in the price of
      (agricultural) products always takes place, since [we
      ask the reader to pay particular attention to the words we have
      italicised I these products cannot be secured unless an expenditure is
      incurred, a payment made, which was not previously made.” Marx goes on to
      say that elements of Nature entering as

    

      agents into production, costing nothing, represent a free gift of Nature’s
      productive power of labour; but if for the production of an additional
      product it is necessary to work without the help of this natural power, a
      new capital outlay is required, which leads to an increase in the cost of
      production.
    

      Concerning this mode of “quoting” we have three remarks to
      make. First, Mr. Bulgakov himself introduced the word
      “since”, which gives his tirade the definite sense of establishing
      some kind of “law”. In the original (Das Kapital, III, 2,

      S. 277-78)[10]
Marx does not say “since” but
“when”. When something is paid for which formerly did
not have to be paid for, there is a relative increase in the price of
the product. Is that proposition anything like a recognition of
the “law” of diminishing returns? Secondly, Mr. Bulgakov
inserts in parentheses the word “agricultural”. In the
original text the word does not appear at all. In all probability,
with the frivolousness characteristic of the Critics, Mr. Bulgakov
decided that in this passage Marx could be speaking only of agricultural
products, and therefore hastened to give his readers an
“explanation” that is a complete misrepresentation. In point
of fact, Marx in this passage speaks of products generally; in the
original, the passage quoted by Mr. Bulgakov is preseded by the words:
“But, in general, the following is to be noted.” Freely bestowed
natural forces may also enter into industrial production—in the
same section on rent Marx gives the example of a waterfall which for a
certain factory takes the place of steam power—and if it is
necessary to manufacture an additional quantity of products without the
aid of these freely bestowed natural forces, there will always
be a relative increase in the price of the products. Thirdly, we must
examine the context in which this passage occurs  Marx discusses in this
chapter differential rent obtained from the worst cultivated soil, and
he examines as always two absolutely equivalent, two
absolutely equally possible cases: the first case—increasing
productivity of successive investments of capital

(S. 274-76),[11]

      and the
      second case—decreasing productivity of such investments

      (S. 276-78).[12]

      In regard to the second of the possible cases, Marx says:
      “Concerning decreasing productiveness of the soil with successive
      investments of

    

      capital, see Liebig.... But, in general, the following is to be
      noted” (our italics). There follows the passage
      “translated” by Mr. Bulgakov, stating that when what was
      formerly obtained gratis has now to be paid for, there is always
      a relative increase in the price of the product.
    

      We shall leave it to the reader to judge the scientific conscientiousness
      of the Critic who turned Marx’s remark about one of the possible cases
      into a recognition of this case by Marx as some sort of general
      “law”.
    

      And the following is the conclusion at which Mr. Bulgakov arrives
      concerning the passage he has discovered:
    

      “This passage, of course, is vague....” Of course! By substituting
      one word for another, Mr. Bulgakov has rendered it utterly meaningless!
      "... but it cannot be understood otherwise than as an indirect or
      even direct recognition [listen

      well! I 

      of the law of diminishing
      returns. I am unaware that Marx has expressed himself openly on the latter
      in any other place” (I, 14). As an ex-Marxist, Mr. Bulgakov is
      “unaware” that Marx openly declared the assumptions of West,
      Malthus, and Ricardo—that differential rent presupposes a transition
      to worse land or diminishing returns—to be utterly

      false.[6]

      He is “unaware” that in the course of his voluminous analysis
      of rent Marx points out scores of times that he regards
      diminishing and increasing productivity of additional investments of
      capital as equally possible cases!

      This evidence of technological advance accompanied by a
      diminution in the agricultural population is of course not at
      all pleasing 1.0 Mr. Bulgakov, for it utterly destroys his
      Malthusianism. Our “strict scientist”, therefore,
      resorts to the following trick: instead of taking agriculture in
      the strict sense of the term (land cultivation, livestock
      breeding, etc.), he (after adducing statistics on the increase
      in the quantity of agricultural produce obtained per
      hectare!) takes “agriculture in the broad sense”, in
      which German statistics include hothouse cultivation, market
      gardening, and forestry and fishing! In this way, we
      get an increase in the’ sum-total of per sons actually engaged
      in “agriculture”!! (Bulgakov, II, p. 133.)  The figures
      quoted above apply to persons for whom agriculture is the
      principal occupation. The number of persons engaged in
      agriculture as a subsidiary occupation increased from 3,144,000
      to 3,578,000. To add these to the previous figures is not
      entirely correct; but even if we do this, the increase is very
      small: from 11,208,000 to 11,623,000.

      This false assumption of classical political economy, refuted by Marx, was

Lenin: 1901/agrarian: The Theory of Rent







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx”



    

    II
The Theory of Rent

      Mr. Bulgakov has completely failed to understand Marx’s theory of rent. He
      is convinced that he has shattered this theory by the two following
      arguments: (1) According to Marx, agricultural capital enters into the
      equalisation of

    

      the rate of profit, so that rent is created by a surplus profit that
      exceeds the average rate of profit. Mr. Bulgakov considers this to be
      false because the monopoly of land ownership eliminates free competition,
      which is necessary for the process of equalising the rate of
      profit. Agricultural capital does not enter into the process of equalising
      the rate of profit. (2) Absolute rent is merely a special case of
      differential rent, and it is erroneous to distinguish the one from the
      other. The distinction is based upon a completely arbitrary twofold
      interpretation of one and the same fact, namely, the monopoly ownership of
      one of the factors of production. Mr. Bulgakov is so convinced of the
      crushing effect of his arguments that he cannot refrain from pouring forth
      a stream of vehement words against Marx, such as petitio

      principii, [An argument based on the conclusion from a proposition
      that has still to be proved.—Ed.]

      non-Marxism, logical fetishism, Marx’s loss of capacity
      for mental flights, and so forth. And yet both those arguments are based
      on a rather crude error. The same one-sided vulgarisation of the subject
      which induced Mr. Bulgakov to raise one of the possible cases (diminishing
      productivity of additional investments of capital) to the level of the
      universal law of diminishing returns brings him in the present instance to
      employ the concept “monopoly” uncritically and to convert it
      into something universal. In doing so, he confuses the results which
      accrue under the capitalist organisation of agriculture from the
      limitedness of land, on the one hand, and from private property
      in land, on the other. These are two different things, as we shall
      explain.
    

      “The condition, although not the source, of the appearance
      of ground-rent,” writes Mr. Bulgakov, “is the same as that which
      gave rise to the possibility of the monopolisation of land—the fact
      that the productivity of the land is limited, while man’s growing need for
      it is limitless” (I, 90). Instead of “the productivity of the
      land is limited”, he should have said, “land is
      limited”. (As we have shown, limitedness of the productivity of
      the land implies “limitedness” of the given technical level,
      the given state of the productive forces.) Under the capitalist system of
      society,

    

      the limitedness of land does indeed presuppose monopolisation of land,
      but of land as an object of economy and not as an object of property
rights. The assumption of the capitalist organisation of
      agriculture necessarily includes the assumption that all the land is
      occupied by separate private enterprises; but it in no way includes
the assumption that the whole of the land is the private property
      of those farmers, or of other persons, or that it is, in general,
      private property. The monopoly of landownership based on property rights
      and the monopoly of the land economy are two entirely different things,
      not only logically, but historically. Logically, we can quite easily
      imagine a purely capitalist organisation of agriculture in which private
      property in land is entirely absent, in which the land is the property
      of the state, or of a village commune, etc. In actual practice we see
      that in all developed capitalist countries the whole of the land is
      occupied by separate, private enterprises; but these enterprises exploit
      not only their own lands, but also those rented from other landowners,
      from the state, or from village communes (e.g., in Russia, where, as is
      well known, the private enterprises established on peasant communal
      lands are principally capitalist peasant enterprises). Not without
      reason did Marx, at the very beginning of his analysis of rent, observe
      that the capitalist mode of production meets in its first stages (and
      subordinates to itself) the most varied forms of landed property:

      from clan

      property[5]

      and feudal landed property down to the property of the peasant commune.
    

      Thus, the limitedness of land necessarily presupposes only the
      monopolisation of the economy of the land (under the domination of
      capitalism). The question arises: what are the necessary consequences of
      this monopolisation in relation to the problem of rent? The
      limitedness of land results in the price of grain being determined by the
      conditions of production, not on the average land, but on the worst land
      under cultivation. This price of grain enables the farmer (= the
      capitalist entrepreneur in agriculture) to cover his cost of production
      and gives him the average rate of profit on his capital. The farmer on the
      better land obtains an additional profit, which forms differential
      rent. The question as to whether private property in land exists

    

      has nothing whatever to do with the question of the formation of
      differential rent, which is inevitable in capitalist agriculture even on
      communal, state, or non-private lands. The only consequence of the
      limitedness of land under capitalism is the formation of differential rent
      arising out of the difference in the productivity of various investments
      of capital. Mr. Bulgakov sees a second consequence in the elimination of
      free competition in agriculture when he says that the absence of this free
      competition prevents agricultural capital from participating in the
      formation of average profit. Obviously, he confuses the question of land
      cultivation with the right of property in land. The only thing that
      logically follows from the limitedness of land (irrespective of private
      property in land) is that the land will be entirely occupied by capitalist
      farmers; but it by no means follows that free competition among those
      farmers will necessarily be restricted in any way. Limitedness of land is
      a general phenomenon which inevitably leaves its impress upon the whole of
      capitalist agriculture. The logical unsoundness of confusing these
      different things is clearly confirmed by history. We shall not speak of
      England, where the separation of landownership from land cultivation is
      obvious, where free competition among farmers is almost limitless, where
      capital obtained from commerce and industry was and is invested in
      agriculture on the widest scale. But in all other capitalist countries
      (not withstanding the opinion of Mr. Bulgakov, who, following Mr. Struve,
      vainly strives to place “English” rent in a special category)
      the same process of the separation of landownership from land
      cultivation is actual, although in extremely varied forms (leases,
      mortgages). In failing to see this process (strongly emphasised by Marx),
      Mr. Bulgakov has failed to see the main thing. In all European countries,
      after the fall of serfdom, we see the decay of landownership based on
      social-estates, the mobilisation of landed property, the investment of
      merchant and industrial capital in agriculture, an increase in tenant
      farming and an increase in the mortgaging of land. In Russia also, despite
      the most pronounced survivals of serfdom, we see after the

      Reform[1]
    

      increased purchasing of land by peasants, commoners, and merchants, and
      increased leasing of privately-owned, state, and village communal
      lands, etc., etc. What do all these phenomena prove? They prove that free
      competition has entered agriculture—despite the monopoly
      of landed property and regardless of the infinite variety of its
      forms. In all capitalist countries at the present time, every owner of
      capital can invest his money in agriculture (by purchasing or leasing
      land) as easily, or almost as easily, as he can invest in any branch of
      commerce or industry.
    

      In arguing against Marx’s theory of differential rent, Mr. Bulgakov says
      that “all these differences [differences in the conditions of the
      production of agricultural products] are contradictory and may
      [our italics] mutually eliminate one another; as Rodbertus pointed out,
      distance may be counteracted by fertility, different degrees of fertility
      may be equalised by more intensive cultivation of the more fertile
      plots” (I, 81). A pity, indeed, that our strict scientist should
      have forgotten that Marx noted this fact and was able to appraise it not
      so one-sidedly. Marx wrote: ". . . It is evident that these two
      different causes of differential rent— fertility and location [of
      plots of land]—may work in opposite directions. A certain plot of
      land may be very favourably located and yet be very poor in fertility, and
      vice versa. This circumstance is important, for it explains how it is
      possible that bringing into cultivation the land of a certain country may
      equally well proceed from the better to the worse land as vice
      versa. Finally, it is clear that the progress of social production in
      general has, on the one hand, the effect of evening out differences
      arising from location [of plots of land] as a cause of ground-rent, by
      creating local markets and improving locations by establishing
      communication and transportation facilities; on the other hand, it
      increases the differences in individual locations of plots of land by
      separating agriculture from manufacturing and forming large centres of
      production, on the one hand, while relatively isolating agricultural
      districts [relative Vereinsamung des Landes] on the other”
      (Das Kapital, III, 2,

S. 190).[6]

      Thus, while Mr. Bulgakov triumphantly repeats
      the long-known references to the possibility of the

    

      mutual elimination of the differences, Marx presents the further
      problem of the transformation of this possibility into reality and shows
      that, simultaneously with equalising influences, there are to be observed
      differentiating influences. The final result of these mutually
      contradictory influences is, as everyone knows, that in all countries
      plots of land differ considerably both in fertility and in
      location. Mr. Bulgakov’s objection merely reveals that he has not given
      any thought whatsoever to his observations.
    

      Continuing his argument, Mr. Bulgakov says that the conception of the last
      and least productive investment of labour and capital is “employed
      uncritically by both Ricardo and Marx. It is not difficult to see what an
      arbitrary element is introduced by this conception: let the amount of
      capital invested in land be equal to 1Oa, and let each successive
      a represent a diminishing productivity; the total product of the soil will
      be A.  Obviously, the average productivity of each a will be
      equal to A/10; and if the total capital is regarded as a single
      whole, then the price will be determined precisely by this average
      productivity” (I, 82). Obviously, we say in reply to this, behind
      his florid phrases about the “limited productivity of the
      land” Mr. Bulgakov failed to see a trifle: the limitedness
      of land. This limitedness, irrespective of the form of property
      in land, creates a certain kind of monopoly, i.e., since all the land is
      occupied by farmers, and since there is a demand for the whole of the
      grain produced on the whole of the land, including the worst land and the
      remotest from the market, it is clear that the price of grain is
      determined by the price of production on the worst land (or the price of
      production connected with the last and least productive investment of
      capital). Mr. Bulgakov’s “average productivity” is a futile
      exercise in arithmetic, for the limitedness of land prevents the actual
      formation of this average. For this “average productivity” to
      form and to determine the prices, every capitalist must, in general, not
      only be able to invest capital in agriculture (to the extent that free
      competition, as we have said, exists in agriculture), but he must be able
      at all times to establish new agricultural enterprises in
      addition to those already existing. If this were possible, there would be
      no difference whatever between agriculture and industry, and rent could

    

      not come into existence. But precisely because of the limitedness of land,
      this is not the case.
    

      To proceed. Until now we have pursued our argument without taking into
      account the question of property in land; we have seen that this method
      was necessary for logical considerations, as well as for the reason that
      historical data show that capitalist agriculture emerged and developed
      under various forms of landownership. Let us now introduce this new
      condition. Let us assume that all land is privately owned. How will this
      affect rent? Differential rent will be collected by the landowner from the
      farmer on the basis of his right of ownership. Since differential rent is
      the surplus profit over and above the normal, average profit on capital,
      and since free competition in the sense of the free investment of capital
      in agriculture exists (is being created by capitalist development), the
      landowner will always find a farmer who will be satisfied with the average
      profit and who will give him the surplus profit. Private property in land
      does not create differential rent; it merely transfers it from the hands
      of the farmer to the hands of the landowner. Is the influence of private
      landownership restricted to that? Can we assume that the landowner will
      permit the farmer to exploit gratis the worst and most
      inconveniently located land, which only produces, the average profit on
      capital? Naturally, not. Landownership is a monopoly, and on the basis of
      this monopoly the landowner demands payment from the farmer for this land
      also. That payment will be absolute rent, which has no connection
      whatever with the difference in productivity of various investments of
      capital, and which has its genesis in the private owner ship of
      land. In accusing Marx of making an arbitrary, two fold
      interpretation of the same monopoly, Mr. Bulgakov did not take the trouble
      to consider that we are actually dealing with a twofold monopoly. In the
      first place, we have the monopoly (capitalist) of land economy. This
      monopoly originates in the limitedness of land, and is therefore
      inevitable in any capitalist society. This monopoly leads to the
      determination of the price of grain by the conditions of production on the
      worst land; the surplus profit obtained by the investment of capital on
      belier land, or by a more productive investment of capital, forms
      differential rent.

    

      This rent comes into being quite independently of private property in
      land, which simply enables the landowner to take it from the farmer. In
      the second place, we have the monopoly of private property in
      land. Neither logically nor historically is this monopoly inseverably
      linked with the previous

      monopoly.[2]

      There is nothing in this monopoly that is essential to capitalist
      society and to the capitalist organisation of agriculture. On the one
      hand, we can quite easily conceive of capitalist agriculture without
      private property in land; indeed, many consistent bourgeois economists
      have demanded the nationalisation of land. On the other hand, even in
      practice we meet with the capitalist organisation of agriculture without
      private ownership of land, e.g., on state and village-commune
      lands. Consequently, it is necessary to distinguish between these two
      kinds of monopolies, as well as to recognise that absolute rent, which is
      engendered by private property in land, exists side by side with
      differential

      rent.[3]
   

    
 

      Marx explains the possibility of the formation of absolute rent from the
      surplus-value of agricultural capital by the fact that in agriculture the
      share of variable capital in the total composition of capital is above the
      average (a quite natural assumption in view of the undoubted backwardness
      of agricultural as compared with industrial technique). This being the
      case, it follows that the value of agricultural products, generally
      speaking, is higher than the cost of their production, and that
      surplus-value is higher than profit. The monopoly of private property in
      land, however, prevents this surplus from passing wholly into the process
      of equalising profits, and absolute rent is taken from this

      surplus.[4]


      Mr. Bulgakov is greatly dissatisfied with this explanation and he
      exclaims: “What kind of thing is this surplus-value, which, like
      cloth or cotton, or some other commodity, can suffice or not suffice to
      cover a possible demand? In the first place, it is not a material thing,
      it is a concept, which serves to express a definite social relationship of
      production”

    

      (I, 105). This contrasting of a “material thing” to a
      “concept” is a striking example of the scholasticism which is
      now so freely offered in the guise of “criticism”. What would
      be the use of a “concept” of the share of the social product
      if there were not definite “material things” corresponding to
      that concept? Surplus-value is the money equivalent of the surplus
      product, which consists of a definite share of cloth, cotton, grain, and
      of all other commodities (the word “definite” must not, of
      course, be understood in the sense that science can concretely define that
      share, but in the sense that the conditions which, in general outline,
      define the dimensions of this share are known). In agriculture, the
      surplus product is larger (in proportion to the capital) than in other
      branches of industry, and this surplus (which does not enter into the
      equalisation of profit owing to the monopoly of private property in land)
      may, naturally, “suffice or not suffice to cover the demand”
      of the monopolist landowner.
    

      We shall not burden the reader with a detailed exposition of the theory of
      rent which Mr. Bulgakov has created, as he modestly remarks, “by his
      own efforts”, “pursuing his own path” (I, 111).
      A few remarks will suffice to characterise this product of the “last
      and least productive investment” of professorial
      “effort”. The “new” theory of rent is brewed
      according to the ancient recipe: “What is worth doing at all is
      worth doing thoroughly”. Since free competition exists, then without
      any restrictions (although absolutely free competition has nowhere and at
      no time existed). Since monopoly exists, there is nothing more to be
      said. Consequently, rent is not taken from surplus-value, and not even
      from the agricultural product; it is taken from the product of non
      agricultural labour; it is simply a tribute, a tax, a deduction from the
      total social product, a promissory note in favour of the
      landlord. “Agricultural capital, with its profit, and agricultural
      labour, agriculture in general as a sphere of investment for capital and
      labour, are therefore a status in

statu* [A state within a state.—Ed.]

      in the kingdom of
      capitalism.... All [sic!] definitions of capital, surplus-value,
      wages, and value generally are imaginary quantities when applied to
      agriculture” (I, 99).
    
 

      So, now everything is clear: both capitalists and wage- workers in
      agriculture are imaginary quantities. But if Mr. Bulgakov at times wanders
      into the clouds, he, at others, argues not altogether
      irrationally. Fourteen pages farther on we read: “The production of
      agricultural products costs society a certain quantity of labour; that is
      the value of these products.”  Excellent. Consequently, at least the
      “definition” of value is not altogether an imaginary
      quantity. Farther ’we read: “Since production is organised on a
      capitalist basis, and since capital stands at the head of production, the
      price of grain will be determined by the price of production, that is, the
      productivity of the given labour and capital invested will be calculated
      according to average social productivity." Fine! Consequently, the
      “definitions” of capital, surplus-value, and wages are not
      altogether imaginary quantities. Consequently, free competition (although
      not absolutely free) exists; for unless capital could flow from
      agriculture into industry and vice versa, “the calculation of
      productivity according to average social productivity” would be
      impossible. Again: “The monopoly in land causes price to rise above
      value to the limits permitted by market conditions.” Excellent! But where
      has Mr. Bulgakov seen that tribute, taxes, promissory notes, etc., are
      dependent upon market conditions? If the monopoly causes price to rise to
      the limits permitted by market conditions, then the only difference
      between the “new” theory of rent and the “old” is
      this: the author, pursuing “his own path”, failed to
      understand the difference between the influence of the limitedness of land
      and the influence of private property in land, on the one hand, and the
      connection between the concept “monopoly” and the concept
      “the last and least productive investment of labour and
      capital”, on the other. Is it surprising, therefore, that seven
      pages farther on (I, 120) Mr. Bulgakov should completely lose sight of
      “his own” theory and argue about the “method of
      distributing this [agricultural] product among the landowner, the
      capitalist farmer, and the agricultural labourers”? A brilliant finale to
      a brilliant criticism! A remarkable outcome of the new Bulgakov theory
      of rent, which, henceforth, will enrich the science of political
      economy!

      It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that we are dealing here with
      the general theory of rent and the capitalist organisation of agriculture;
      we do not, therefore, concern ourselves with facts like th  antiquity and
      widespread character of private property in land, or the undermining of
      the last-mentioned form of monopoly, and partly of both its forms, by
      overseas competition, and so forth.
    —Lenin

[3]

      In the second part of Volume II of Theories of Surplus-Value (Theorien
über den Mehrwert, II. Band, If. Theil), published in 1905,
Marx gives an explanation of absolute rent which confirms the
correctness of my interpretation (particularly in regard to the two
forms of monopoly). The following passages from Marx pertain to this
interpretation: “If land were an unlimited element, not only in
relation to capital and to population, but in actual fact, i.e., if it
were as ‘unlimited’ as ‘air and water’, if it ‘existed in unlimited
quantities’ quotations from Ricardo], then the appropriation of land by
one per son could not in practice in any way exclude the appropriation
of land by another person. In that case, private (as also ‘public’ and
state) property in land could not exist. If, in addition, the land every
where were of the same quality, no rent could be obtained for it.... The
crux of the matter is—if land in relation to capital existed as a
natural element, then capital in the sphere of agriculture would operate
in the same way as it does in every other sphere of industry. There
would then be no property in land and no rent.... On the other hand, if
land is: (1) limited; and (2) appropriated—if property in land is
a condition for the emergence of capital—and that is precisely the
case in countries where capitalist production is developing; and in
countries where this condition did not formerly exist (as in old
Europe),

   

capitalist production itself creates it, as in the United
States— then land does not represent a field of activity
accessible to capital in an elementary way. That is why absolute rent
exists, apart from differential rent”

(pp. 80-81).[7]

      Marx definitely draws a distinction here between the
      limitedness of land and the fact that land is private property. (Author’s note
      to the 1908 edition.—Ed.)
    —Lenin

[4]

      We desire to say in passing that we have considered it necessary to deal
      in particular detail with Marx’s theory of rent because we find that the
      interpretation Mr.. P. Maslov gives of it is also incorrect ("The
      Agrarian Question”, in Zhizn, Nos. 3 and 4, 1901). In that
      article, he regards the diminishing productivity of successive investments
      of capital, if not as a law, then at all events as the “usual”
      and as it were normal phenomenon, which he links with differential rent,
      and he rejects the theory of absolute rent. Mr. P. Maslov’s interesting
      article contains many true remarks concerning the Critics, but it suffers
      greatly from the author’s erroneous theory just referred to (while
      defending Marxism, he has not taken the trouble to define clearly the
      difference between “his own” theory and that of Marx), as well
      as from a number of careless and utterly unjust assertions, as, for
      example, that Mr. Berdyaev “is completely liberating himself from
      the influence of bourgeois authors” and is distinguished for his
      “consistent class point of view, maintained without sacrificing
      objectivity”; that “in many respects Kautsky’s analysis is in
      places ... tendentious”; that Kautsky “has completely failed
      to indicate in what direction the development of the productive forces in
      agriculture is proceeding”; and so forth.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx”



    

    III
Machinery in Agriculture

      Let us now pass to what Mr. Bulgakov regards as the
      “remarkable” work of Hertz (Die agrarischen Fragen im
      Verhältniss zum Sozialismus, Wien,

      1899. [Friedrich Otto Hertz, The Agrarian Questions in Relation to
Socialism. Vienna. 1899.—Ed.]

      Russian translation by A. Ilyinsky, St. Petersburg, 1900). We shall need,
      however, to spend a little time in simultaneously examining similar
      arguments by both authors.
    

      The question of machinery in agriculture and the closely connected
      question of large- and small-scale production in agriculture most
      frequently provide the “Critics” with the occasion to
      “refute” Marxism. We shall later analyse some of the detailed
      data they present; for the present let us examine their general
      arguments. The Critics devote entire pages to arguing in detail that the
      use of machinery encounters greater difficulties in agriculture than in
      industry and for that reason machines are used to a smaller extent and
      have less significance. This is indisputable, and it was definitely shown,
      for example, by the same Kautsky whose name is enough to arouse
      Messrs. Bulgakov, Hertz, and Chernov to a state bordering on frenzy. But
      this indisputable fact does not in the least controvert the other fact
      that the use of machinery is developing rapidly in agriculture also, and
      that it has a powerful transforming effect upon it. All that the Critics
      can do is to “evade” this inevitable conclusion by such
      profound arguments as, “Agriculture is characterised by the
      domination of Nature in the process of production and by the lack of human
      free will” (Bulgakov, I, 43). ". ..instead of the uncertain and
      imprecise work of man, it [machinery in industry] performs micrometric as
      well as colossal, work with mathematical precision. The machine cannot do
      the like [?] in the production of agricultural products because, to this
      day, this working instrument is not in the hands of man, but in the hands
      of Mother Nature. This is no metaphor” (ibid.). Indeed it is no
      metaphor; it is merely an empty phrase; for everyone knows that the steam
      plough, the seed-drill, the threshing-machine, etc., make work
      more “certain

    

      and precise”; consequently, to say, “cannot do the
      like”, is simply to talk nonsense! Similarly, how can it be said
      that machinery in agriculture “cannot to any extent [sic!]
      revolutionise production” (Bulgakov, I, 43-44, where he
      quotes the opinion of agricultural machinery experts, who, however, merely
      refer to the relative difference between agricultural and industrial
      machinery), or that “not only cannot machinery convert the worker
      into its adjunct[?], but that the worker still retains his previous
      control of the process” (44) —as feeder of the
      threshing-machine, perhaps?
    

      Mr. Bulgakov tries to belittle the superiority of the steam plough by
      references to Stumpfe and Kutzleb (who wrote of the ability of small-scale
      farming to compete with large-scale farming), as against the opinions of
      experts in agricultural machinery and agricultural economics
      (Fühling, Perels). He advances arguments to the effect that steam
      ploughing requires a special

      soil[1]

      and “extremely extensive estates” (in Mr. Bulgakov’s opinion
      this is not an argument against small-scale farming, but against the steam
      plough!), and that with 12-inch furrows the work of animals is
      cheaper than steam power, and so forth. One could fill tomes with
      such arguments, without, however, in the least refuting the fact that the
      steam plough has made extremely deep ploughing possible (furrows deeper
      than 12 inches), or the fact that its use has rapidly developed: in
      England, in 1867, only 135 estates were using steam ploughs, whereas in
      1871 over 2,000 steam ploughs had come in to use (Kautsky); in Germany the
      number of farms using steam ploughs increased from 836 in 1882 to 1,696 in
      1895.
    

      On the question of agricultural machinery Mr. Bulgakov frequently cites Franz
      Bensing, whom he recommends as “the author of a special monograph on
      agricultural machinery” (I, 44). It would be most unfair if we did not
      in the present case show how Mr. Bulgakov quotes his authors, and
      how the very witnesses he calls testify against him.
    
 

      In arguing that Marx’s “construction” on the more rapid growth
      of constant capital as compared with variable capital is inapplicable to
      agriculture, Mr. Bulgakov points to the need of a larger expenditure of
      labour-power in proportion to the increase in the productivity of
      agriculture, and, among others, quotes the calculations made by Bensing:

      "The general amount of human labour required by the various systems
      of economy is expressed as follows: the three-field system—712
      man-days; the Norfolk crop rotation system—1,615 man-days; crop
      rotation with a considerable production of sugar-beet—3,179 man-days
      per 60 hectares” (Franz Bensing, Der Einfluss der
      landwirtschaftlichen Maschinen auf Volks- and

Privatwirtschaft, [The Influence of Agricultural Machinery on
National and Private Economy.—Ed.]

      Breslau, 1897, S. 42. Quoted by Bulgakov, I, 32). The unfortunate thing,
      how ever, is that by this calculation Bensing desired to prove that the
      role of machinery is growing. Applying these figures to German agriculture
      as a whole, Bensing calculates that the available agricultural workers
      would be sufficient to cultivate the land only on the three-field system,
      and that, consequently, the introduction of a crop rotation system would
      have been altogether impossible without machines. It is well
      known that when the old three-field system prevailed machinery was hardly
      utilised at all; consequently, Bensing’s calculation proves the
      opposite of what Mr: Bulgakov tries to prove; this calculation
      shows that the growth of productivity of agriculture was necessarily
      accompanied by a more rapid growth of constant capital as compared with
      variable capital.
    

      Elsewhere Mr. Bulgakov, after asserting that “a radical
      [sic!]  difference exists between the role of machinery in the
      manufacturing industry and in agriculture”, quotes the words of
      Bensing: “Agricultural machinery cannot effect an unlimited increase
      in production in the way machines in industry do...” (I, 44). Mr. Bulgakov
      is unlucky again. Bensing points to this by no means “radical”
      difference between agricultural and industrial machinery in the beginning
      of Chapter VI of his book, which is entitled: “The Influence of
      Agricultural Machinery on Gross Income”. After making a detailed

    

      analysis of the data relating to each special type of machine as published
      in agricultural literature and of his own findings obtained in a special
      inquiry, Bensing arrives at the following general conclusion: the increase
      in gross income obtained by the use of a steam plough is ten per cent, of
      a seed-drill ten per cent, and of a threshing-machine fifteen per cent;
      moreover, the seed-drill causes a saving of twenty per cent in seed; only
      the use of potato-digging machines shows a decline of five per cent in
      gross income. Mr. Bulgakov’s assertion that “at all events, the
      steam plough is the only agricultural machine about which anything favour
      able can be said from the technical point of view” (I, 47-48) is
      at all events refuted by the very Bensing to whom incautious
      Mr. Bulgakov here refers.
    

      In order to present the significance of machinery in agriculture as
      precisely and completely as possible, Bensing makes a number of detailed
      calculations of the results of farming carried on without machinery, with
      one machine, with two machines, and so forth, and, finally, with the use
      of all the important machines, including the steam plough and light
      railways (Feldbahnen). He found that in farming without the aid
      of machinery gross income amounted to 69,040 marks—expenditure,
      68,615 marks, net income, 425 marks, or 1.37 marks per hectare. In farming
      that made use of all the important machines gross income amounted to
      81,078 marks—expenditure, 62,551.5 marks, net income, 18,526.5
      marks, or 59.76 marks per hectare, i.e., more than forty times as much
      as in the first case. That is the effect of machinery alone, for the
      system of cultivation is assumed to have remained unchanged. It goes
      without saying that the use of machinery is accompanied, as Bensing’s
      calculations show, by an enormous increase in constant capital and a
      diminution in variable capital (i.e., in the capital expended on
      labour-power and in the number of workers employed). In short, Bensing’s
      work entirely refutes Mr. Bulgakov and proves the superiority of
      large-scale production in agriculture, as well as the fact that the law of
      the growth of constant capital at the expense of variable capital is
      applicable to agriculture.
    

      Only one thing makes Mr. Bulgakov akin to Bensing, and that is that the latter
      adopts the purely bourgeois point of

    

      view, completely fails to understand the contradictions inherent in
      capitalism, and smugly pretends not to see that machines oust the worker,
      etc. This moderate and methodical pupil of the German professors speaks of
      Marx with a hatred to match Mr. Bulgakov’s, except that Bensing is more
      consistent—he calls Marx “an opponent of machinery” in
      general, in both agriculture and industry, because, says he, Marx
      “distorts the facts” when he talks of the harmful effect
      machines have on the workers and attributes all sorts of misfortunes to
      machines (Bensing, loc. cit., S. 4, 5, and 11). Mr. Bulgakov’s
      attitude toward Bensing reveals to us again and again what the
      “Critics” take from the bourgeois scientists and what they
      pretend not to see.
    

      The nature of Hertz’ “criticism” is sufficiently revealed by
      the following example. On page 149 of his book (Russian translation) he
      charges Kautsky with employing “feuilleton methods”,
      and on page 150 he “refutes” the assertion that large-scale
      production is superior to small-scale production in regard to the use of
      machinery, by the following arguments: (1) Machinery is
      accessible also to small farmers through the medium of co-operative
      societies. That, if you please, is supposed to refute the fact
      that machinery is used on a larger scale on big farms! On the question as
      to who has greater access to the benefits of co-operative
      organisation, we shall have a separate talk with Hertz in our second
      essay. (2) David has shown in Sozialistische

Monatshefte[8]

      (Vol. V, No. 2) that the use of machinery on small farms “is
      extensive and is rapidly increasing ... that seed-drills are frequently
      [sic] to be found even on very small
      farms. The same applies to mowers and other machines” (S. 63,
      Russian translation, p. 151). But if the reader turns to David’s

      article,[2]

      he will see that the author takes the absolute figures of the
      number of farms using machinery, and not the percentage of those farms in
      relation to the total number of farms in the given category (as Kautsky
      does, of course).
    

      Let us compare those figures, which are for the whole of Germany for

      1895:[3]

      Confirmation indeed of the statement of David and Hertz that
      seeding-machines and mowers are “frequently” found “even
      on very small farms”!  And if Hertz draws the “conclusion”
      that, “judged by statistics, Kautsky’s assertion will not stand
      criticism”, who is it that really employs feuilleton
      methods?
    

      It should be pointed out as a curiosity that whereas the
      “Critics” deny the superiority of large-scale farming in
      regard to the use of machinery and deny the overwork and under consumption
      caused by this fact in small farming, they outrageously contradict
      themselves when compelled to deal with the actual facts of the situation
      (and when they forget their “principal task”—to refute
      “orthodox” Marxism). Thus, in Volume II of his book (p. 115)
      Mr. Bulgakov says:

      "Large-scale farming always works with greater capital intensity than
      small-scale farming, and therefore, naturally, gives preference to the
      mechanical factors of production over live labour-power.” That
      Mr. Bulgakov as a “Critic” should follow Messrs. Struve and
      Tugan-Baranovsky in their inclination towards vulgar political economy by
      contrasting mechanical “factors of production” to
      live factors is indeed quite “natural”. But is it natural that
      he should so incautiously deny the superiority of large-scale farming?
    

      On concentration in agricultural production Mr. Bulgakov can find no other
      words with which to express himself than “the mystical law of
      concentration”, and so forth. But he comes up against the figures for
      England, and they show that a tendency towards the concentration of farms
      was

    

      observed from the fifties to the end of the seventies. “Small
      subsistence farms combined into larger farms,” writes
      Mr. Bulgakov. “This consolidation of land was by no means
      the result of the conflict between large-scale and small-scale production
      [?] but of a conscious [?!] striving on the part of the landlords to
      increase their rents by combining several small farms which provided them
      with very low rents into large farms capable of paying them larger
      rents” (I, 239). We are to understand from this: Not conflict
      between large- scale and small-scale farming, but the elimination
      of the latter, because it is less remunerative. “Since farming is
      established on a capitalist basis, it is indisputable that within certain
      limits large-scale capitalist farming possesses undoubted advantages over
      small-scale capitalist farming” (I, 239-40). If this is
      indisputable, why the clamour? Why did Mr. Bulgakov cry murder (in
      Nachalo) against Kautsky, who begins his chapter on
      large-scale and small-scale production (in his Agrarian Question)
      with the statement: “The more capitalistic agriculture becomes, the
      more qualitative be comes the difference in technique between large-scale
      and small-scale production”?
    

      But not only the period of prosperity of English agriculture—also
      the period of crisis leads to conclusions unfavourable to small-scale
      farming. The reports of commissions published during recent years
      “with astonishing per sistence assert that the crisis has most
      severely affected the small farmers” (I, 311). One report dealing
      with small owners says: “Their homes are worse than the average
      labourers’ cottages.... All of them work astonishingly hard and for many
      more hours than the labourers, and many of them say that their material
      conditions are not so good as those of the latter, that they do not live
      as well and rarely eat fresh meat.... The yeomen, burdened with mortgages,
      were the first to go under...” (I, 316). “They stint themselves in
      all things as only few labourers do.... The small farmers keep going as
      long as they are able to avail themselves of the unpaid labour of the
      members of their families.... It is hardly necessary to add that the
      living conditions of the small farmers are far worse than those of the
      labourers” (I, 320.21). We have quoted these passages so that the
      reader may judge the correctness of the following conclusion drawn by Mr.

    

      Bulgakov: “The severe ruination of the farms which had survived
      until the epoch of the agrarian crisis indicates merely [!!] that in such
      circumstances small producers succumb more quickly than large
      producers—and nothing more [sic!!]. It is utterly
      impossible to draw from this any general conclusion concerning the
      economic viability of small farms, for in that epoch the whole of English
      agriculture was insolvent” (I, 333). Isn’t this priceless? And in
      the chapter dealing with the general conditions of development of peasant
      farming, Mr. Bulgakov even generalises this remarkable method of reasoning
      in the following manner: “A sudden drop in prices has a serious
      effect on all forms of production; but peasant production, having least
      capital at its disposal, is naturally less stable than large-scale
      production (which does not in the slightest affect the question of its
      general viability)” (II, 247). Thus, in capitalist society, enterprises
      having less capital at their disposal are less stable; but that does not
      affect their “general” viability!
    

      Hertz is not more consistent in his reasoning. He “refutes”
      Kautsky (in the manner described above); but in discussing America he
      admits the superiority of large-scale farming in that country, which
      permits “the employment of machinery on a far larger scale than our
      parcellised farming permits” (S. 36, Russian translation, p. 93). He
      admits that “the European peasant, employing antiquated, routine
      methods of production, frequently toils [robotend] for a crust of bread
      like a labourer, without striving for anything better”
      (ibid.). Hertz admits generally that “small-scale production employs
      a relatively larger amount of labour than large-scale production”
      (S. 74, Russian translation, p. 177); he could well communicate to
      Mr. Bulgakov the data on the increase in yield resulting from the
      introduction of the steam plough (S. 67-68, Russian translation,
      pp. 162-63), etc.
    

      The natural concomitant of our Critics’ faulty theoretical reasoning on
      the significance of agricultural machinery is their helpless repetition of
      the views of downright reactionary agrarians who are opposed to
      machinery. Hertz, it is true, still hesitates on this delicate point; in
      speaking of the “difficulties” in the way of introducing
      machinery in agriculture, he observes: “The opinion is expressed
      that so much free time is left in the winter that hand threshing is

    

      more profitable” (S. 65, Russian translation,
      pp. 156-57). Apparently, Hertz, with the logic peculiar to him, is
      inclined to draw the conclusion that this is an argument, not against
      small production, not against the capitalist obstacles to the introduction
      of machinery, but against machinery! It is not surprising that
      Mr. Bulgakov chides Hertz for being “too closely tied to the opinion
      of his party” (II, 287). The Russian professor, of course, is above
      such degrading “ties” and proudly declares: “I am
      sufficiently free from the prejudice so widespread—particularly in
      Marxist literature—according to which every machine must be regarded
      as progress” (I, 48). Infortunately, the flight of imagination
      revealed in this magnificent piece of reasoning finds no correspondence in
      concrete conclusions. “The steam threshing-machine,” writes
      Mr. Bulgakov, “which deprives very many workers of winter
      occupation, spelt for the labourers an undoubtedly serious evil
      uncompensated by technical

      advantages.[4]

      Goltz, incidentally, points this out and even gives expression to a
      utopian desire” (II, 103), i.e., the desire to restrict the
      use of threshing-machines, particularly steam threshers, “in
      order”, adds he, “to improve the conditions of the
      agricultural labourers, as well as to reduce emigration and

      migration”,(by 

      migration Goltz, in all probability, means movement to the towns).
    

      We shall remind the reader that this Goltzian idea was also noted by
      Kautsky in his Agrarian Question. It will not be without
      interest, therefore, to compare the attitude of the narrow orthodox
      Marxist, steeped in Marxist prejudices, with that of the latter-day Critic
      who has excellently assimilated the whole spirit of
      “criticism” towards a concrete question of economics (the
      significance of machines) and politics (not to be restricted?).
    

      Kautsky says (Agrarfrage, S. 41) that Goltz ascribes a particularly
      “harmful influence” to the threshing-machine:
      it deprives the agricultural labourers of their principal

    

      winter occupation, drives them into the towns, and intensifies the
      depopulation of the countryside. Goltz proposes to restrict the use of the
      threshing-machine, and, Kautsky adds, proposes this “ostensibly in
      the interests of agricultural labourers, but in fact in the interests of
      the landlords, for whom,” as Goltz himself says, “the loss resulting
      from such restriction will be amply compensated—if not immediately,
      then in the future—by the larger number of workers they will be able
      to obtain in the summer-time”. “Fortunately,” continues
      Kautsky, “this conservative friendship for the labourers is nothing
      more nor less than reactionary utopianism. The threshing-machine is of too
      great an ’immediate’ advantage for the landlord to be induced to abandon
      its use for the sake of profits ’in the future’. And so, the thresher will
      continue to perform its revolutionary work; it will continue to drive the
      agricultural labourers into the towns, and as a result will become a
      powerful instrument for the raising of wages in the rural districts, on
      the one hand, and for. the further development of the agricultural machine
      industry, on the other.”
    

      Mr. Bulgakov’s attitude towards the problem as presented by a
      Social-Democrat and by an agrarian is very characteristic; it is an
      example in miniature of the position all the contemporary
      “Critics” occupy midway between the party of the proletariat
      and the party of the bourgeoisie. The Critic, of course, is not so
      narrow-minded and not so banal as to adopt the point of view of the class
      struggle and the revolutionising of all social relationships by
      capitalism. On the other hand, however, although our Critic “has
      grown wiser”, the recollection of the time when he was “young
      and foolish”, and shared the prejudices of Marxism, prevents him
      from adopting in its entirety the programme of his new comrade, the
      agrarian, who quite reasonably and consistently passes from the conclusion
      that machinery is harmful “for the whole of
      agriculture” to the desire to prohibit its use. And our good Critic
      finds himself in the position of Buridan’s ass, between two bundles of
      hay. On the one hand, he has lost all understanding of the class struggle
      and is now capable of saying that machinery is harmful for “the
      whole of agriculture”, forgetting that the whole
      of modern agriculture is conducted mainly by entrepreneurs, who are
      concerned only

    

      about their profit; he has so far forgotten “the years of his
      youth”, when he was a Marxist, that he now raises the extremely
      absurd question as to whether the technical advantages of machinery will
      “compensate” for its harmful effects upon the labourers
      (produced, not by the steam thresher alone, but by the steam plough, the
      mower, seed-sifter, etc.). He even fails to see that, in fact, the
      agrarian wants to enslave the labourer further both in winter and in
      summer. On the other hand, he vaguely recalls the obsolete,
      “dogmatic” prejudice that, prohibiting machinery is
      utopian. Poor Mr. Bulgakov! Will he manage to extricate himself from this
      unpleasant situation?
    

      It is interesting to note that in trying in every way to belittle the
      significance of agricultural machinery, and even making use of the
      “law of diminishing returns”, our Critics have forgotten to
      mention (or have deliberately refrained from mentioning) the new
      technological revolution which electrical engineering is preparing in
      agriculture. But Kautsky, who, according to the extremely unfair judgement
      of Mr. P. Maslov, “committed a serious mistake in completely failing
      to indicate the course taken by the development of the productive forces
      in agriculture” (Zhizn, 1901, No. 3, p. 171), pointed to
      the significance of electricity in agriculture as far back as 1899 (in
      Die Agrarfrage). Today, the symptoms of the approaching
      technological revolution are much more distinct. Attempts are being made
      to elucidate theoretically the significance of electricity in agriculture
      (see Dr. Otto Pringsheim, Landwirtschaftliche Manulaktur und
      elektrische

Landwirtschaft, [Agricultural Manufacture and Electrified
Agriculture.—Ed.]

      Brauns Archiv, XV, 1900, S. 406-18; and Kautsky’s article in Neue

Zeit,[9]

      XIX, 1, 1900-01,
      No. 18, “Die Elektrizität in der

Landwirtschaft” [“Electricity in
      Agriculture.”—Ed.] ).

      Practical landlord’ farmers are describing their experiments in the
      application of electricity (Pringsheim cites a work by Adolf Seufferheld,
      who describes the experiments on his own farm). These landlords see in
      electricity a means of making agriculture once more remunerative. They
      call upon the government and the landlords to establish

    

      central power stations and to organise the mass production of electricity
      for farmers. (Last year a work was published in Königsberg, written
      by P. Mack, an East-Prussian landlord, entitled Der Aufschwung unseres
      Landwirtschaftsbetriebes durch Verbilligung der Produktionskosten. Eine
      Untersuchung über den Dienst, den Maschinentechnik und
      Elektrizität der Landwirtschaft

bieten. [The Rise in Our Agriculture Through
    Reduced Cost of Production. An Inquiry into the Services Offered to
    Agriculture by Mechanical Engineering and
    Electricity.—Ed.] )
    

      Pringsheim makes what in our opinion is a very true observation: that, in
      its general technological, and perhaps even economic, level, modern
      agriculture is at a stage of development which more than anything
      resembles the stage of industry Marx described as
      “manufacture”. The predominance of hand labour and simple
      co-operation, the sporadic employment of machines, the relatively small
      extent of production (if we consider, for example, the total annual volume
      of products sold by a single enterprise), the relatively limited market
      for the most part, the connection between large- and small-scale
      production (the latter, like the handicrafts man in his relation to the
      big master-manufacturer, supplies the former with labour-power—or
      else the former buys up the “semi-finished articles” from the
      latter; thus, the big farmer buys beets, cattle, etc., from the small
      farmers)— all these are symptoms of the fact that agriculture has
      not yet reached the stage of real “large-scale machine
      industry” in the Marxian sense. In agriculture there is no
      “system of machines” as yet linked into one productive
      mechanism.
    

      Of course, this comparison must not be carried too far. On the one hand,
      agriculture possesses certain peculiar features that cannot possibly he
      removed (if we leave aside the extremely remote and problematic
      possibility of producing protein and foods in laboratories). Owing to
      these peculiarities, large-scale machine production will never manifest in
      agriculture all the features it possesses in industry. On the
      other hand, even in the manufacture stage of development large-scale
      production in industry reached predominance and considerable technical
      superiority over small-scale production.

    

      For a long time the small producer tried to counteract this superiority by
      the lengthened working day and curtailed consumption which are so
      characteristic of the handicrafts man and of the modern small peasant. The
      predominance of hand labour in the manufacture stage enabled the small
      producer to hold his own for a time by “heroic” measures such
      as these. But those who were deceived by this and talked about the
      viability of the handicraftsman (even as our contemporary Critics talk of
      the viability of the peasant) very soon found themselves refuted by the
      “temporary tendency” which paralysed the “universal
      law” of technological stagnation. Let us recall, for instance, the
      Russian investigators into the handicraft weaving industry in Moscow
      Gubernia in the seventies. As far as cotton weaving was concerned, they
      said, the hand weaver was doomed; the machine had triumphed. The
      handicraft silk weaver, however, may still hold his own for a time, the
      machinery being still far from perfect. Two decades have passed, and
      machinery has driven the small producer from still another of his last
      refuges, as if telling those who have ears to hear and eyes to see that
      the economist must always look forward, towards technological progress, or
      else be left behind at once; for he who will not look ahead turns his back
      on history; there is not and there cannot be any middle path.
    

      “Writers who, like Hertz, in treating of competition between small-
      and large-scale production in agriculture ignored electrical engineering,
      must start their investigation all over again,” aptly remarked Pringsheim,
      which remark applies with still greater force to Mr. Bulgakov’s two-volume
      work.
    

      Electricity is cheaper than steam power. It is more easily divisible into small
      units, it can be more easily transmitted over very long distances; machinery
      powered by electricity runs more smoothly and precisely, and for that reason it
      is more convenient to use it in threshing, ploughing, milking, cutting

      fodder,[5]

      etc. Kautsky describes one of the Hungarian

    

      latifundia[6]

      in which electricity is transmitted from a central station in all
      directions to the remote parts of the estate and is used for running
      agricultural machinery, for chopping mangels, for raising water, for
      lighting, etc., etc. “In order to pump 300 hectolitres a day from a
      well 29 metres deep into a reservoir 10 metres high, and in order to
      prepare fodder for 240 cows, 200 calves, and 60 oxen and horses, i.e., for
      chopping mangels, etc., two pairs of horses were required in the winter
      and one pair in the summer, at a cost of 1,500 gulden. Now, the horses
      have been replaced by a three and a five h.p. motor costing altogether 700
      gulden to maintain, which represents a saving of 800 gulden”
      (Kautsky, loc. cit.). Mack calculates the cost of a horse-workday at 3
      marks; but if the horse is replaced by electricity the cost is

      40 to 75 pfennigs, i.e., four to seven times cheaper. If in 50 years or
      more from now, he says, 1,750,000 of the horses used in German agriculture
      were supplanted by electricity (in 1895, 2,600,000 horses, 1,000,000 oxen,
      and 2,300,000 cows were used for field work in German agriculture, of
      which 1,400,000 horses and 400,000 oxen were used on farms exceeding 20
      hectares in area), expenses would be reduced from 1,003,000,000 marks to
      261,000,000 marks, i.e., by 742,000,000 marks. An enormous area of land
      now utilised for raising cattle feed could then be turned to the
      production of food—for the improvement of the food of the workers,
      whom Mr. Bulgakov tries so much to scare with the prospect of the
      “diminution of the gifts of Nature”, “the grain
      problem”, and so forth. Mack strongly recommends the uniting of
      agriculture with industry for the permanent exploitation of electricity;
      he recommends the cutting of a Mazurian canal to provide power for five
      power stations which would distribute electricity to farmers within a
      radius of 20-25 kilometres. He recommends the use of peat for the same
      purpose, and demands the association of farmers: “Only in
      co-operative association with industry and big capital is it possible to
      make our branch of industry profitable once again” (Mack, S. 48). Of
      course, the employment of new methods of production will encounter many
      difficulties; it will

    

      not proceed in a straight line, but in zigzag fashion; however, that the
      employment of new methods will take place, that the revolution in
      agriculture is inevitable, can hardly be doubted. “The substitution
      of electric motors for the majority of draught animals,” rightly says
      Pringsheim, “means opening up the possibility of the machine system
      in agriculture.... What could not be achieved by steam power will
      certainly be achieved by electrical engineering, namely, the advancement
      of agriculture from the old manufacture stage to modern large—scale
      production” (loc. cit., p. 414.)
    

      We shall not dilate upon the enormous victory the introduction of
      electrical engineering in agriculture will represent (and partly already
      represents) for large-scale production; it is too obvious to require
      emphasis. It will be better to see which modern farms contain the
      rudiments of this “machine system” that will be set in motion
      by a central power station. Before the machine system can be introduced,
      it is first of all necessary to test various kinds of machines, to conduct
      experiments with many combinations of machines. The information we require
      can be found in the returns of the German agricultural census of June 14,
      1895. We have figures showing the number of farms in each category that
      used their own or hired machines. (Mr. Bulgakov, when citing some of these
      figures on page 114, Vol. II, erroneously takes them to apply to the
      number of machines used. In passing, it may be said that the
      statistics on the number of farms using machines, their own or hired,
      naturally bring out the superiority of large-scale farming to a smaller
      extent than is really the case. Big farmers have their own machines more
      often than small farmers, who are obliged to pay exorbitant prices for the
      hire of machines.) The data relate to the use either of machines in
      general, or of a certain kind of machine, so that we are not able to
      determine how many machines the farms in each group use. But if
      for each group we compute the number of farms using each separate kind of
      machine, we shall obtain the number of cases in which
      agricultural machines of all kinds are used. The following table
      presents the data drawn up in this manner and shows ho v the ground is
      being prepared for the “machine system” in agriculture.
    
    

    












Size of farms
Per hundred farms



Number of farms that used agricultural machines generally
    (1895)
 Number of instances in which some kind of agricurtural machine
    was used (1895)




Under 2 hectares
2.03
2.30

2 to 5
13.81
15.46

78.79
128.46


100 and over
94.16
352.34


Average

22.36



      Thus, in small farms under five hectares (these comprise more than
      three-fourths of the total in this group, viz., 4,100,000 out of
      5,500,000, or 75.5 per cent; but they account for only 5,000,000 hectares
      out of a total of 32,500,000 hectares, or 15.6 per cent), the number of
      cases in which agricultural machines of any type are used (we
      have included dairy machinery) is quite insignificant. Of the medium farms
      (from 5 to 20 hectares) fewer than half use machines generally, while the
      number of instances showing use of agricultural machines represents only
      56 per hundred farms. Only under large-scale capitalist

      production[7]

      do we see the majority of farms (from three-quarters to
      nine-tenths) using machinery and the beginning of the establishment of
      a machine system: on every farm there is more than one case of use of
      machinery. This means that several machines are used on a single farm: for
      example, farms of over 100 hectares use about four machines each
      (352 per cent as compared with 94 per cent using machines generally). Of
      572 latifundia (farms of 1,000 hectares and over), 555 use machines; and
      the number of cases in which machines were used is 2,800, i.e., each farm
      used five machines. It is clear from this which farms are
      preparing the ground for the “electrical” revolution and which
      will mostly take advantage of it.

      Hertz, with a particularly “triumphant” air, insists upon
      this, contending that the “absolute” judgement
      (S. 65, Russian translation, p. 156) that the steam plough is
      superior to the horse plough “under all circumstances” is
      false. This is precisely what is called forcing an open door!

      This is for the information of our bold Mr. Bulgakov, who boldly and

    IV
The Abolition of the Antithesis Between Town and
      Country. Particular
      Questions Raised by the “Critics”

      From Hertz let us pass to Mr. Chernov. As the latter merely “talks
      with his readers” about the former, we shall confine ourselves here
      to a brief description of Hertz’ method of argument (and Mr; Chernov’s
      method of paraphrasing him), and (in the next essay) take up certain new
      facts advanced by the “Critics”.
    

      It will suffice to cite but a single example to show the sort of
      theoretician Hertz is. At the very beginning of his book we find a
      paragraph under the pretentious heading, “The Concept of National
      Capitalism”. Hertz wants nothing more nor less than to present a
      definition of capitalism. He writes: “We can, of course,
      characterise it as a system of national economy which rests
      juridically on the completely applied principles of freedom of
      the person and of property, technically on production on a wide
      [large?]

      scale,[1]
socially on the alienation of the means of
      production from the direct producers, politically on the
      possession by the capitalists of the central political power [the
      concentrated political power of the state?  ... solely on the economic
      basis of the distribution of property” (Russian translation,
      p. 37). These definitions are incomplete, and certain reservations must be
      made, says Hertz; for example, domestic industry and small tenant farming
      still persist everywhere side by side with large-scale
      production. “The realistic [sic!] definition of capitalism
      as a system under which production is under the control [domination and
      control] of capitalists [owners of capital] is likewise not quite
      suitable.” A fine “realistic” definition of capitalism as the
      domination of capitalists! How characteristic it is—this now
      fashionable, quasi-realistic, but in fact eclectic quest for an exhaustive
      enumeration of all the separate symptoms and separate
      “factors”. The result, of

    

      course, is that this meaningless attempt to include into a general concept
      all the partial symptoms of single phenomena, or, conversely, to
      “avoid conflict with extremely varied phenomena”—an attempt
      that merely reveals an elementary failure to understand what science
      is—leads the “theoretician” to a point where he cannot
      see the wood for the trees. Thus, Hertz lost sight of such a detail as
      commodity production and the transformation of labour-power into a
      commodity! Instead, he invented the following genetic definition,
      which—as punishment for the inventor—ought to be quoted in
      full: Capitalism is “that state of national economy in which the
      realisation of the principles of free exchange arid freedom of the person
      and of property has reached its (relative) high point which is determined
      by the economic development and the empirical conditions of each separate
      national economy” (S. 10, Russian translation, pp. 38-39, not quite
      exact). Filled with awe and admiration, Mr. Chernov, of course,
      transcribes and describes this twaddle, and, moreover, treats the readers
      of Russkoye Bogatstvo for the space of thirty pages to an
      “analysis” of the types of national capitalism. From this
      highly instructive analysis we can extract a number of extremely valuable
      and by no means stereotyped references, for example, to the
      “independent, proud, and energetic character of the Briton”;
      to the “substantial” English bourgeoisie and the
      “unattractiveness” of their foreign policy; to the
      “passionate and impulsive temperament of the Latin race” and
      to the “methodicalness of the Germans” (Russkoye
      Bogatstvo, No. 4, p. 152). “Dogmatic” Marxism, of course,
      is utterly annihilated by this analysis.
    

      No less annihilating is Hertz’ analysis of mortgage statistics. At all
      events, Mr. Chernov goes into ecstasies over it. “The fact is,” he
      writes, "...Hertz’ figures have not yet been refuted by
      anyone. Kautsky, in his reply to hertz, dwelt at extreme length upon
      certain details [such as his proof of Hertz’ distortions—a
      fine ’detail’!], but to Hertz’ argument on the question of mortgages
      he made no reply whatever” (Russkoye Bogatstvo,
      No. 10, p. 217, Mr. Chernov’s italics). As can be seen from the reference
      on page 238 in the cited issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo, Mr. Chernov
      is aware of the article Kautsky wrote in reply (“Zwei Kritiker
meiner
    

      Agrarfrage”, [2]

      in Neue Zeit, 18, 1, 1899-1900). Mr. Chernov could not but know,
      too, that the periodical in which the article appeared is prohibited in
      Russia by the censor. The more noteworthy, therefore, as characterising
      the features of the modern “Critics”, is the fact that the
      very words which Chernov himself underlines contain a flagrant
      untruth; for on the question of mortgages Kautsky replied to
      “Hertz, David, Bernstein, Schippel, Bulgakov, e tutti

      quanti”,[3]

      on pp. 472-77, in the selfsame article to which Mr. Chernov
      refers. To rectify distorted truth is a tedious duty; but since we
      have to deal with the Messrs. Chernov, it is a duty not to be neglected.
    

      Kautsky, of course, replied to Hertz with ridicule; for in regard to this
      question too Hertz revealed his inability, or unwillingness, to understand
      what is what and an inclination to repeat the threadbare arguments of
      bourgeois economists. Kautsky in his Agrarfrage (S. 88.89) dealt
      with the concentration of mortgages. “Numerous petty village
      usurers,” wrote Kautsky, “are being forced more and more into the
      back ground, forced to yield to big centralised capitalist or public
      institutions which monopolise mortgage credit.” Kautsky enumerates certain
      capitalist and public institutions of this type; he speaks of mutual land
      credit societies (genossenschaftliche Bodenkreditinstitute) and
      points to the fact that savings-banks, insurance companies, and
      many corporations (S. 89) invest their funds in mortgages, etc. Thus,
      until 1887, seventeen mutual credit societies in Prussia had issued
      mortgage bonds to the amount of 1,650,000,000 marks. “These figures
      show how enormously ground-rent is concentrated in the hands of a few
      central institutions [our italics]; but this concentration is rapidly
      increasing. In 1875 German mortgage banks issued mortgage bonds to the
      amount of 900,000,000 marks and in 1888 to the amount of

      2,500,000,000 marks, while in 1892 the amount reached a total of 3,400,000,000
      marks, concentrated in 31 banks (as against 27 in 1875)” (S. 89). This
      concentration of ground-rent is a clear indication of the concentration of
      landed property.
    
 

      “No!” retort Hertz, Bulgakov, Chernov & Co. “We
      find a very decided tendency towards decentralisation and the break-up of
      property” (Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 10, p. 216); for
      “more than a fourth of the mortgage credits are concentrated in the
      hands of democratic [sic!] I credit institutions with a vast number of
      small depositors” (ibid.). Presenting a series of tables, Hertz
      attempts with extraordinary zeal to prove that the bulk of the depositors
      in savings-banks, etc., are small depositors. The only question
      is—what is the purpose of this argument? Kautsky himself referred to
      the mutual credit societies and savings-banks (while not, of course,
      imagining, as does Mr. Chernov, that they are particularly
      “democratic” institutions). Kautsky speaks of the
      centralisation of rent in the hands of a few central institutions, and he
      is met with the argument about the large number of small depositors in
      savings-banks!! And this they call “the break up of property”! What
      has the number of depositors in mortgage banks to do with agriculture (the
      subject under discussion being the concentration of rent)? Does a big
      factory cease to signify the centralisation of production because its
      shares are distributed among a large number of small capitalists?
      “Until Hertz and David informed me,” wrote Kautsky in his reply to
      the former, “I had not the slightest idea where the savings-banks
      obtained their money. I thought they operated with -the savings of the
      Rothschilds and the Vanderbilts.”
    

      In regard to transferring mortgages to the state, Hertz says: “This
      would be the poorest way of fighting big capital, but, of course, the best
      means of arousing the large and constantly increasing army of the smallest
      property-owners, particularly the agricultural labourers, against the
      proponents of such a reform” (S. 29, Russian translation,
      p. 78. Mr. Chernov smugly repeats this on pp. 217-18 of Russkoye
      Bogatstvo).
    

      These then are the “property-owners” over whose increase
      Bernstein & Co. get so wrought up!—retorts Kautsky. Servant
      girls with twenty marks in the savings-bank! And again we have the
      threadbare argument employed against the socialists that by
      “expropriation” they will rob a large army of working
      people. None other than Eugen Richter zealously advanced this argument in
      the pamphlet he published after the repeal of the Exceptional Law Against
      the

    

      Socialists[10]

      (and which employers bought up by the thou sands to distribute gratis
      among their workers). In that pamphlet Richter introduces his celebrated
      “thrifty Agnes”, a poor seamstress who had a score or so of
      marks in the savings-bank and was robbed by the wicked socialists when
      they seized political power and nationalised the banks. That is the source
      from which the

      Bulgakovs,[4]

      Hertzes, and Chernovs draw their “critical” arguments.
    

      “At that time,” says Kautsky, concerning Eugen Richter’s
      “celebrated” pamphlet, “Eugen Richter was unanimously
      ridiculed by all Social-Democrats. Now we find people among the latter
      who, in our central organ [this, I think, refers to David’s articles in

      Vorwärts],[11]

      sing a hymn of praise to a work in which these very ideas are
      reproduced. Hertz, we extol thy deeds!
    

      “For poor Eugen, in the decline of his years, this is indeed a
      triumph, and I cannot refrain from quoting for his pleasure the following
      passage from that very page in Hertz’ book:

      ’We see that the small peasants, the urban house-owners, and especially
      the big farmers, are expropriated by the lower and middle classes the bulk
      of which undoubtedly consists of the rural population’" (Hertz, S. 29,
      Russian translation, p. 77. Retold with rapture in Russkoye
      Bogatstvo, No. 10, pp. 216-17). “David’s theory of ’hollowing
      out’ [Aushöhlung] capitalism by collective wage agreements
      [Tarifgemeinschaften] and consumers’ co-operative societies is
      now excelled. It pales into insignificance before Hertz’ expropriation of
      the expropriators by means of savings-banks. Thrifty Agnes, whom everybody
      considered dead, has come to life again” (Kautsky, loc. cit.,
      S. 475), and the Russian “Critics”, together with the
      publicists of Russkoye Bogatstvo, hasten to transplant this
      resurrected “thrifty Agnes” to Russian soil in order to
      discredit “orthodox” Social-Democracy.
    

      And this very Mr. V. Chernov, spluttering with enthusiasm over Hertz’
      repetition of Eugen Richter’s arguments, “annihilates” Kautsky
      in the pages of Russkoye Bogatstvo and in the symposium At
      the Glorious Post, compiled in honour of Mr. N. Mikhailovsky. It
      would be unfair not to present some

    

      of the gems of this tirade. “Kautsky, again following Marx,” writes
      Mr. Chernov in Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 8, p. 229, “admits
      that the progress of capitalist agriculture leads to the reduction of
      nutritive matter in the soil: in the form of various products, something
      is continuously being taken from the land, sent to the towns, and never
      restored to the land.... As you see, on the question of the laws of the
      fertility of the soil, Kautsky helplessly [sic!] repeats the
      words of Marx, who bases himself upon the theory of Liebig. But when Marx
      wrote his first volume, Liebig’s ’law of restoration’ was the last word in
      agronomics. More than half a century has elapsed since that discovery. A
      complete revolution has taken place in our knowledge of the laws governing
      soil fertility. And what do we see? The whole post-Liebig period, all the
      subsequent discoveries of Pasteur and Ville, Solari’s experiments with
      nitrates, the discoveries of Berthelot, Hellriegel, Wilfahrt, and
      Vinogradsky in the sphere of the bacteriology of the soil—all this
      is beyond Kautsky’s ken...." Dear Mr. Chernov! How wonderfully he
      resembles Turgenev’s Voroshilov: you remember him in Smoke, the
      young Russian Privatdocent who went on a tour abroad. This
      Voroshilov was a very taciturn young man; but now and again he would break
      his silence and pour forth scores and hundreds of the most learned of
      names, the rarest of the rare. Our learned Mr. Chernov, who has utterly
      annihilated that ignoramus Kautsky, behaves in exactly the same
      manner. Only ... only had we not better consult Kautsky’s
      book—glance at least at its chapter headings? We come to Chapter IV:
      “Modern Agriculture”, section d, “Fertilisers,
      Bacteria”. We turn to section d and read:
    

      “Towards the end of the last decade the discovery was made that
      leguminous plants ... unlike other cultivated plants, obtain nearly the
      whole of their nitrogen supply, not from the soil, but from the air, and
      that far from robbing the soil of nitrogen they enrich it. But they
      possess this property only when the soil contains certain micro-organisms
      which adhere to their roots. Where these micro-organisms do not exist, it
      is possible by means of certain inoculations to give these leguminous
      plants the property of converting soil poor in nitrogen into nitrogen-rich
      soil, and in this way to fertilise this soil to a certain extent for other
      crops. As a general

    

      rule, by inoculating bacteria into these plants and by using a suitable
      mineral fertiliser (phosphoric acid salts and pot ash fertilisers), it is
      possible to obtain the highest steady yields from the soil even without
      stable manure. Only thanks to this discovery has ’free farming’ acquired a
      really firm basis” (Kautsky, pp. 51-52). Who, however, gave a
      scientific basis to the remarkable discovery of nitrogen-gathering
      bacteria?—Hellriegel....
    

      Kautsky’s fault is his bad habit (possessed by many of the narrow
      orthodox) of never forgetting that members of a militant socialist party
      must, even in their scientific works, keep the working-class reader in
      mind, that they must strive to write simply, without employing
      unnecessary clever turns of phrase and those outer symptoms of
      “learning” which so captivate decadents and the titled
      representatives of official science. In this work, too, Kautsky preferred
      to relate in a clear and simple manner the latest discoveries in
      agronomics and to omit scientific names that mean nothing to nine-tenths
      of the readers. The Voroshilovs, however, act in precisely the opposite
      manner; they prefer to effuse a veritable stream of scientific names in
      the domains of agronomics, political economy, critical philosophy, etc.,
      and thus bury essentials under this scientific lumber.
    

      Thus, Voroshilov-Chernov, by his slanderous accusation that Kautsky is not
      acquainted with scientific names and scientific discoveries, blocked from
      view an extremely interesting and instructive episode in fashionable
      criticism, namely, the attack of bourgeois economics upon the socialist
      idea of abolishing the antithesis between town and country. Prof. Lujo
      Brentano, for instance, asserts that migration from the country to the
      towns is caused, not by given social conditions, but by natural
      necessity, by the law of diminishing

      returns.[5]

      Mr. Bulgakov, following in the footsteps

    

      steps of his teacher, stated in Nachalo (March 1899, p. 29) that
      the idea of abolishing the antithesis between town and country was
      “an absolute fantasy”, which would “cause an agronomist
      to smile”. Hertz writes in his book: “The abolition of the
      distinction between town and country is, it is true, the principal
      striving of the old utopians [and even of the Manifesto.]
      Nevertheless, we do not believe that a social system containing all the
      conditions necessary for directing human culture to the highest aims
      achievable would really abolish such great centres of energy and culture
      as the big cities and, to soothe offended aesthetic sentiments, abandon
      these abundant depositories of science and art, without which progress is
      impossible” (S. 76. The Russian translator, on p. 182, rendered the
      word

      “potenziert” [Raised to a higher power,
abundant.—Ed.]

      as “potential”. These Russian translations are an awful
      nuisance! On page 270, the same translator translates the sentence,
      “Wer isst zuletzt das

Schwein?” [Who, in the end, eats the
pig?—Ed.]

      as “Who, in the end, is the pig?”). As can be seen, Hertz defends
      the bourgeois system from socialist “fantasies” with phrases
      that convey the “struggle for idealism” no less than do the
      writings of Messrs. Struve and Berdyaev. But his defence is not in the
      least strengthened by this bombastic, idealistic phrase-mongering.
    
 

      The Social-Democrats have proved that they know how to appreciate the
      historic services of the great centres of energy and culture by their
      relentless struggle against all that encroaches on the freedom of movement
      of the population generally and of the peasants and agricultural labourers
      in particular. That is why no agrarian can trap them, as he can the
      Critics, with the bait of providing the “muzhik” with winter
      “employment”. The fact that we definitely recognise the
      progressive character of big cities in capitalist society, however, does
      not in the least prevent us from including in our ideal (and in our
      programme of action, for we leave unattainable ideals to Messrs. Struve
      and Berdyaev) the abolition of the antithesis between town and country. It
      is not true to say that this is tantamount to abandoning the treasures of
      science and art. Quite the contrary: this is necessary in order to bring
      these treasures within the reach of the entire people, in order
      to abolish the alienation from culture of millions of the rural
      population, which Marx aptly described as “the idiocy of rural

      life”.[12]

      And at the present time, when it is possible to
      transmit electric power over long distances, when the technique of
      transport has been so greatly improved that it is possible at less cost
      (than at present) to carry passengers at a speed of more than 200 versts
      an

      hour,[6]

      there are absolutely no technical obstacles to the enjoyment of the
      treasures of science and art, which for centuries have been concentrated
      in a few centres, by the whole of the population spread more or less
      evenly over the entire country.
    

      And if there is nothing to prevent the abolition of the antithesis between
      town and country (not be imagined, of course, as a single act but as a
      series of measures), it is not an “aesthetic sentiment” alone
      that demands it. In the big cities people suffocate with the fumes of
      their own excrement, to use Engels’ expression, and periodically all who
      can, flee from.the cities in search of fresh air and pure

      water.[13]

      Industry
      is also spreading over the countryside; for it, too, requires pure
      water. The exploitation of waterfalls, canals,

    

      and rivers to obtain electric power will give a fresh impetus to this
      “spreading out of industry”. Finally—last, but not

least[These words are in English in the
original.—Ed.]–the

      rational utilisation of city refuse in general, and human excrement in
      particular, so essential for agriculture, also calls for the abolition of
      the antithesis between town and country. It is against this point in the
      theory of Marx and Engels that the Critics decided to direct their
      agronomical arguments (the Critics preferred to refrain from fully
      analysing the theory, which is dealt with in great detail in Engels’

      Anti-Dühring,[14]

      and, as usual, limited themselves simply to
      paraphrasing fragments of the thoughts of a Brentano). Their line of
      reasoning is as follows: Liebig proved that it is necessary to restore to
      the soil as much as is taken from it. He was therefore of the opinion that
      throwing city refuse into the seas and rivers was a stupid and barbarous
      waste of materials essential for agriculture. Kautsky agrees with Liebig’s
      theory. But modern agronomics has proved that it is quite
      possible to restore the productive forces of the soil without the use of
      stable manure, namely, by means of artificial fertilisers, by the
      inoculation of certain bacteria into leguminous plants which collect
      nitrates, etc. Consequently, Kautsky, and all those
      “orthodox” people, are simply behind the times.
    

      Consequently—we reply—here, too, the Critics commit one of
      their innumerable and endless distortions. After explaining
      Liebig’s theory, Kautsky immediately showed that modern
      agronomics has proved that it is quite possible “to dispense
      altogether with stable manure” (Agrarfrage, S. 50; see
      passage quoted above), but added that this was merely a
      palliative compared with the waste of human excrement entailed by
      the present system of city sewage disposal. Now, if the Critics were at
      all capable of discussing the essential points of the question, this is
      the point they should have disproved; they should have shown that it is
      not a palliative. But they did not even think of doing so. Need less to
      say, the possibility of substituting artificial for natural manures and
      the fact that this is already being done (partly) do not in the
      least refute the irrationality of wasting natural fertilisers and thereby
      polluting the rivers and the air

    

      in suburban and factory districts. Even at the present time there are
      sewage farms in the vicinity of large cities which utilise city refuse
      with enormous benefit to agriculture; but by this system only an
      infinitesimal part of the refuse is utilised. To the objection that modern
      agronomics has refuted the argument that the cities agronomically exploit
      the countryside, with which the Critics present Kautsky as something new,
      he replies, on page 211 of his book, that artificial fertilisers
      “render it possible to avoid the diminution of soil fertility, but
      the necessity to employ them to an increasing extent merely indicates
      still another of the numerous burdens agriculture has to bear, which
      are by no means a natural necessity, but a product of existing social

relations”.[7]


      The words we have emphasised contain the “pivot” of the
      question which the Critics so zealously confuse. Writers like Mr. Bulgakov
      try to scare the proletariat with the bogy that the “grain
      question” is more terrible and important than the social question
      they are enthusiastic over birth control and argue that “control of
      the increase of the population” is becoming “the fundamental
      [sic!] economic condition” for the prosperity of the
      peasantry (II, 261), that this control is worthy of “respect”,
      and that “much hypocritical indignation [only hypocritical, not
      legitimate, indignation against the present social system?] is roused
      among sentimental [?!] moralists by the increase in births among the
      peasant population, as if unrestrained lust [sic!] were in
      itself a virtue” (ibid.). Such writers must naturally and inevitably
      strive to keep in the background the capitalist obstacles to
      agricultural progress, to throw the entire blame for everything upon the
      natural “law of diminishing returns”, and to present the idea
      of abolishing the antithesis between town and country as “pure
      fantasy”. But what utter irresponsibility the Chernovs betray when
      they repeat such arguments and at the same time reproach the Critics of
      Marxism for “lacking principles and for being eclectics and
      opportunists” (Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 11, p. 246)?! What
      spectacle could be more comical

    

      than that of Mr. Chernov reproving others for lack of principles and for
      opportunism.
    

      All the other critical exploits of our Voroshilov are identical to what we have
      just examined.
    

      Voroshilov assures us that Kautsky fails to understand the difference
      between capitalist credit and usury; that he betrays. utter failure, or
      unwillingness, to understand Marx, in maintaining that the peasant fulfils
      the functions of entrepreneur and, as such, stands in the same relation to
      the proletariat as the factory owner. Beating his breast, Voroshilov cries
      out: “I say this boldly because I feel [sic!] the ground
      firmly under my feet” (At the Glorious Post, p. 169). In
      all this, rest assured, Voroshilov is again hopelessly confusing things
      and boasting as usual. He “failed to see” the passages in
      Kautsky’s book that deal with usury as such (Agrarfrage, S. 11,
      102-04, especially 118, 290-92), and with all his might forces an open
      door, shouting as usual about Kautsky’s “doctrinaire
      formalism”, “moral hard-heartedness”, “mockery at
      human sufferings”, and so forth. In regard to the peasant fulfilling
      the functions of entrepreneur, apparently this astonishingly complicated
      idea is beyond the scope of Voroshilov’s comprehension. In the next essay,
      however, we shall try to clarify this for him with very concrete examples.
    

      When Voroshilov seeks to prove that he is a real representative of the
      “interests of labour” and abuses Kautsky for “driving
      from the ranks of the proletariat numerous genuine working people”
      (op. cit., p. 167), such as the Lumpen proletariat, domestic
      servants, handicraftsmen, etc., then the reader can be assured that
      Voroshilov is again muddling things together. Kautsky examines the
      distinguishing characteristics of the “modern proletariat”
      which created the modern “Social-Democratic proletarian
      movement” (Agrarfrage, S. 306); but to date the Voroshilovs
      have produced nothing to show that tramps, handicraftsmen, and domestic
      servants have created a Social-Democratic movement. The charge directed at
      Kautsky that he is capable of “driving” domestic servants (who
      in Germany are now beginning to join the movement), handicraftsmen, etc.,
      from the ranks of the proletariat merely exposes to the full the impudence
      of the Voroshilovs; their display of friendship for the “genuine
      working people” increases as such phrases decrease in practical

    

      significance, and they can attack with greater impunity the second
      part of the Agrarian Question, which has been suppressed by
      the Russian censor. Speaking, incidentally, of impudence, there are some
      other gems. In praising Messrs.

      N.—on[15]

      and Kablukov, while completely ignoring the Marxist criticism directed
      against them, Mr. Chernov, with affected naiveté, asks: To whom do
      the German Social-Democrats refer when they speak of their Russian
      “comrades”?  Let him who finds it hard to believe that such
      questions are asked in Russkoye Bogatstvo, turn to No. 7, p. 166.
    

      When Voroshilov asserts that Engels’ “prediction” that the
      Belgian labour movement will prove barren owing to the influence of

      Proudhonism[16]

      “has been proved false”, then the
      reader may well know that Voroshilov, self-assured in his, shall we say,
      “irresponsibility”, is again distorting the facts. He writes:
      “It is not surprising that Belgium has never been orthodox Marxist,
      and it is not surprising that Engels, being displeased with her for that
      reason, predicted that the Belgian movement, owing to the influence of
      ’Proudhonist principles’, would pass ’von nichts durch nichts zu,

nichts’.[8]

      Alas, this prediction has fallen through, and the breadth and many
      sidedness of the Belgian movement enable it to serve to day as a model
      from which many ’orthodox’ countries are learning a great deal”
      (Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 10, p. 234). The facts are as follows:
      In 1872 (seventy-two!), Engels was engaged in a polemic in the columns of
      the Social-Democratic paper

      Volksstaat[17]

      with the German Proudhonist Mülberger; to deflate the exaggerated
      importance attached to Proudhonism, he wrote: “The only country
      where the working-class movement is directly under the influence of
      Proudhonist ’principles’ is Belgium, and precisely as a result of this the
      Belgian movement comes, as Hegel would say, ’from nothing through nothing
      to

      nothing’.”[9]


      Thus, it is positively untrue to say that Engels
      “predicted” or “prophesied” anything. He merely
      spoke of the facts as they were, i.e., the situation that existed
      in 1872. And it is an

    

      undoubted historical fact that at that time the Belgian movement
      was marking time precisely because of the predominance of Proudhonism,
      whose leaders were opposed to collectivism and repudiated independent
      proletarian political action. Only in 1879 was a “Belgian Socialist
      Party” formed; and only from that time onwards was the campaign for
      universal suffrage conducted, marking the victory of Marxism over
      Proudhonism (the recognition of the political struggle of the proletariat
      organised in an independent class party) and the beginning of the
      pronounced successes of the movement. In its present programme the
      “Belgian Labour Party” has adopted all the
      fundamental ideas of Marxism (apart from certain minor points). In 1887,
      in a preface to the second edition of his articles on the housing
      question, Engels laid special emphasis on the “gigantic progress the
      international working-class movement has made during the past fourteen
      years”. This progress, he writes, is largely due to the elimination
      of Proudhonism, which predominated at that time and which
      now has been almost forgotten. “In Belgium,”

      Engels observes, “the Flemings have ousted the Walloons from the
      leadership of the movement, deposed [abgesetzt] Proudhonism, and
      greatly raised the level of the movement” (preface, p. 4. of the same

      pamphlet).[18]
Russkoye Bogatstvo’s description of the facts
      is a veritable paragon of fidelity!
    

      When Voroshilov ... but enough! Of course, we cannot hope to keep up with this
      legally published magazine, which is able with impunity, month after month, to
      give vent to a flood of falsehood about “orthodox” Marxism.

[5]

      See Kautsky’s article “Tolstoi und Brentano” in Neue
Zeit, XIX, 2, 1900-01, No. 27. Kautsky compares modern scientific

      socialism with the doctrines of Lev Toistoi, who has always been a pro
      found observer and critic of the bourgeois system, notwithstanding the
      reactionary naiveté of his theory, and bourgeois economics, whose
      “star”, Brentano (the teacher, as we know, of Messrs. Struve,
      Bulgakov, Hertz, e tutti quanti), betrays the most incredible
      muddle-headedness in confounding natural with social phenomena, in
      confounding the concept of productivity with that of profitability, the
      concept

   

      of value with that of price, etc. “This is not so characteristic of
      Brentano personally,” Kautsky says justly (p. 25), “as of the
      school to which be belongs. The historical school of
      bourgeois economics, in its modern form, regards the striving towards an
      integral conception of the social mechanism as being a superseded
      standpoint [überwundener Standpunkt]. According to this
      view, economic science must not investigate social laws and combine them
      into an integral system, but must confine itself to the formal description
      of separate social facts of the past and the present. Thus, it accustoms
      one to swim merely on the surface of things; and when a representative of
      this school, nevertheless, succumbs to the temptation to get to the bottom
      of things, he finds himself out of his depth and flounders helplessly
      round and round. In our party, too, there has been observed for some time
      a tendency to substitute for the Marxist theory, not some other theory,
      but that absence of all theory [Theorielosigkeit] which
      distinguishes the historical school—a tendency to degrade the
      theoretician to the position of a mere reporter. To those who desire, not
      simply an aimless skipping [Fortwurschteln] from instance to in
      stance, but an integral, energetic movement forward towards a great goal,
      the Brentano confusion which we have exposed must serve as a warning
      against the present methods of the historical school.”

      “It goes without saying,” continues Kautsky, “that artificial

      enrich the soil with special materials and not fulfil the whole
      task of restoring its fertility.”

      prohibited, socialist literature was confiscated, and the banishment of
      Social-Democrats was begun. The law was annulled in 1890 under pressure of
      the mass working-class movement.

Proudhonism—an unscientific trend in petty-bourgeois
      socialism, hostile to Marxism, so called after its ideologist, the French
      anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon criticised big capitalist
      property from the petty-bourgeois position and dreamed of perpetuating
      petty property ownership; he proposed the foundation of
      “people’s” and “exchange” banks, with the aid of
      which the workers would be able to acquire the means of production, become
      handicraftsmen, and ensure the “just” marketing of their
      wares. Proudhon did not understand the role and significance of the
      proletariat and displayed a negative attitude towards the class struggle,
      the proletarian revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat; as an
      anarchist he denied the necessity for the state.Marx and Engels struggled
      persistently against Proudhon’s efforts to impose his views on the First
      International. Proudhonism was subjected to a ruthless criticism in Marx’s
      Poverty of Philosophy. The determined struggle waged by Marx,
      Engels, and their supporters ended in the complete victory of Marxism over
      Proudhonism in the First International.
    

      Lenin called Proudhonism the “dull thinking of a petty-bourgeois and
      a philistine” incapable of comprehending the viewpoint of the
      working class. The ideas of Proudhonism are widely utilised by bourgeois
      “theoreticians” in their class-collaboration propaganda.

The Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx”



    

    V
“The Prosperity of Advanced, Modern Small
    Farms”. The Baden

      Example[1]



      Details, details! cries Mr. Bulgakov in Nachalo (No. 1, pp. 7 and 13);
      and this slogan is repeated a hundred times in a hundred different sharps and
      flats by all the “Critics”.
    
 

      Very well, gentlemen, let us examine the details.
    

      It was utterly absurd of you to direct this slogan at Kautsky, since the
      principal task of a scientific study of the agrarian question, which is
      encumbered with a countless number of disconnected details, was to present
      a general picture of the whole of the modern agrarian system in its
      development. Your slogan merely concealed your lack of scientific
      principle and your opportunistic dread of any integral and well
      thought-out philosophy. Had you not read Kautsky’s book in the manner of a
      Voroshilov, you would have been able to derive from it a great deal of
      information on handling and assimilating detailed statistics. And that you
      are unable to operate with detailed statistics we shall now demonstrate by
      a number of examples chosen by yourselves.
    

      In his article entitled “Peasant Barbarians”, directed against
      Kautsky and published in the magazine of the Voroshilovs,
      Sozialistische (??) Monatshefte (III. Jahrg., 1899, Heft
      2), Eduard David triumphantly refers to “one of the most
      thorough and interesting monographs” on peasant farming that
      have appeared recently, namely, that of Moritz Hecht, entitled Drei
      Dörfer der badischen

Hard [Three Villages in the Hard of
  Baden.—Ed.]

      (Leipzig, 1895). Hertz clutched at this reference and, following David,
      cited some figures from this “excellent work” (S. 68, Russian
      translation, p. 164) and “strongly recommended” (S. 79,
      Russian translation, p. 188) the reading of the original or of the passage
      given by David. Mr. Chernov, in Russkoye Bogatstvo, hastened to
      repeat both David and Hertz, and contrasted to Kautsky’s statements
      Hecht’s “striking pictures of the prosperity of advanced, modern
      small farms” (No. 8, pp. 206-09).
    

      Let us then turn to Hecht.
    

      Hecht describes three Baden villages located at distances ranging from four to
      fourteen kilometres from Karlsruhe:
      Hagsfeld, Blankenloch, and Friedrichsthal. Although the farms are small, from
      one to three hectares, the peasants lead a prosperous and cultured life and
      gather an exceptionally large yield from their land. David (followed by
      Chernov)

    

      compares this yield with the average yield for the whole of Germany (in
      double centners per hectare: potatoes, 150-160 and 87.8; rye and wheat,
      20-23 and 10-13; hay, 50-60 and 28.6) and exclaims: What do you think of
      that as an example of “backward small peasants”! In the first place,
      we reply, insofar as no comparison is made between small—and
      large-scale farming conducted under the same conditions, it is absurd to
      view this as an argument against Kautsky. Mr. Chernov appears even more
      absurd when he asserts, in Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 8, p. 229,
      that “Kautsky’s rudimentary view [regarding the agronomic
      exploitation of the village by the town] even exaggerates the shady
      aspects of capitalism”, and when he cites, on page 209 of the same
      issue, as an argument against Kautsky, an instance in which this
      capitalist obstacle to the progress of agriculture is eliminated
      by the fact that the villages he selects are situated in proximity to
      towns. While the overwhelming majority of the agricultural population lose
      an enormous quantity of natural fertilisers as a result of the
      depopulation of the rural districts by capitalism and the concentration of
      the population in the cities, an insignificant minority of suburban
      peasants obtain special benefits from their situation and become rich at
      the expense of the impoverishment of the masses. It is not surprising that
      the yield in the villages described is so high, considering that they
      spend the sum of 41,000 marks annually on manure from the army stables in
      the three neighbouring garrison towns (Karlsruhe, Bruchsal, and Durlach)
      and on liquid refuse from the urban drainage systems (Hecht, S. 65);
      artificial fertilisers are purchased only to the amount of 7,000 marks

      annually.[2]

      To attempt to refute the technical superiority of large-scale over
      small-scale farming by adducing instances of small farms

    

      operating under such conditions means merely to expose one’s
      impotence. Secondly, to what extent do these instances really represent
      “genuine small peasants”, echte und rechte
      Kleinbauem, as David says, and as Hertz and Chernov repeat after him?
      They mention only the area of the farms, and in this way prove
      only their inability to handle detailed statistics. As everyone knows, a
      hectare of land is to a suburban peasant what ten hectares are to a
      peasant living in a remote district; moreover, the very type of
      farms undergoes radical change because of the proximity of towns. Thus,
      the price of land in Friedrichsthal, the village which has the least land,
      but which is the most prosperous of the suburban villages, ranges from
      9,000 to 10,000 marks, live times the average price of land in
      Baden (1,938 marks), and about twenty times the price in remote
      districts in East Prussia. Consequently, judged by the size of output (the
      only exact index of the size of a farm), these are by no means
      “small” peasants. In regard to the type of farming,
      we see here a remarkably high stage of development of money
      economy and the specialisation of agriculture, which is
      particularly emphasised by Hecht. They cultivate tobacco (45 per cent of
      the area under cultivation in Friedrichsthal) and high grades of potatoes
      (used partly for seed and partly for the table of the
      “gentry”—Hecht, S. 17—in Karlsruhe); they sell milk,
      butter, sucking-pigs, and grown pigs to the capital, and them selves buy
      grain and hay. Agriculture here has assumed a completely commercial
      character, and the peasant who conducts his farm in the neighbourhood of
      the capital is the purest type of petty bourgeois; so that, had
      Mr. Chernov really familiarised himself with the details he borrows from
      others, he might have acquired some understanding of this category of
      “petty-bourgeois” peasant which is to him so mysterious (see
      Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 7, p. 163). It is most curious that both
      Hertz and Mr. Chernov, while declaring that they are totally unable to
      understand how the peasant fulfils the functions of an entrepreneur, how
      he is able to figure as a

    

      worker at one moment and as an entrepreneur at another, refer to the
      detailed investigation of an author who says bluntly: “The peasant
      of the eighteenth century, with his eight-to-ten hectares of land, was a
      peasant [“was a peasant”, Mr. Chernov!] and a manual
      labourer; the dwarf peasant of the nineteenth century, with his one or two
      hectares of land, is a brainworker, an entrepreneur and a merchant”
      (Hecht, S. 69; cf. S. 12: “The farmer has become a merchant
      and an entrepreneur.” Hecht’s italics). Well, have not Hertz and
      Mr. Chernov “annihilated” Kautsky in the Voroshilov manner for
      confusing the peasant with the entrepreneur?
    

      The clearest indication of the “entrepreneur” is his
      employment of wage-labour. It is highly characteristic that not one of the
      quasi-socialists who referred to Hecht’s work uttered a single
      word about that fact. Hecht, a most typical Kleinbürger
      of the ultra-loyal type, who waxes enthusiastic. over the piety of the
      peasants and the “paternal solicitude” shown them by the Grand
      Duchy officials in general, and over their adoption of such an
      “important” measure as, in particular, the establishment of
      cookery schools, naturally tries to obscure those facts and to show that
      no “social gulf” separates the rich from the poor, the peasant
      from the agricultural labourer, or the peasant from the factory
      worker. “No agricultural day-labourer category exists,”
      writes Hecht. “The majority of the peasants are able to cultivate
      their land themselves, with the help of their families; only a few in
      those three villages experience the need for outside help during the
      harvest or at threshing time; such families ’request’ [’bitten’],
      to employ the local expression, certain men or women, who would never
      dream of calling themselves ’day-labourers’, ’to help them’"
      (S. 31). There is nothing surprising in the fact that only a few farmers
      in the three villages mentioned hire day-labourers, because many
      “farmers”, as we shall see, are factory workers. What
      proportion of pure farmers employ hired labour Hecht does not say; he
      prefers to pack his candidate’s thesis (the Germans call it doctoral
      dissertation), which is devoted only to three villages (of one of which he
      is a native), not with exact statistics concerning the various categories
      of peasants, but with reflections on the high moral significance of
      diligence and thrift. (Notwithstanding this, or perhaps because of it,
      Hertz and David extol Hecht’s

    

      work to the skies.) All we learn is that the wages of day-labourers are
      lowest in the most prosperous and purely agricultural village,
      Friedrichsthal, which is farthest away from Karlsruhe (14 kilometres). In
      Friedrichsthal, a day-labourer gets two marks a day, paying for his own
      keep, while in Ragsfeld (4 kilometres from Karlsruhe and inhabited by
      factory workers) the wages of a day-labourer are three marks a day. Such
      is one of the conditions of the “prosperity” of the
      “real small peasants” so much admired by the
      Critics. “In those three villages,” Hecht informs us, “purely
      patriarchal relations still exist between the masters and their
      servants [Gesinde in German means both domestic servants
      and farm labourers]. The ’master’, i.e., the peasant with three to four
      hectares of land, addresses his men and women labourers as ’thou’ and
      calls them by their forenames; they call the peasant ’uncle’
      [Vetter] and the peasant’s wife ’auntie’ [Base], and
      address them as ’you’.... The labourers eat at the family table and are
      regarded as members of the family” (S. 93). Our “most
      thorough” Hecht says nothing about the extent to which hired labour
      is employed in tobacco growing, which is so widely developed in that
      district and which requires a particularly large number of labourers; but
      since he has said at least something about wage-labour, even this very
      loyal little bourgeois must be regarded as being much better able to
      handle the “details” of a research than the Voroshilovs of
      “critical” socialism.
    

      Thirdly, Hecht’s research was used to refute the fact that the peasantry
      suffers from overwork and undernourishment. But here it turns out that the
      Critics preferred to ignore facts of the kind mentioned
      by Hecht. They cleverly utilised that conception of the
      “middle” peasant by means of which both the Russian Narodniks
      and the West-European bourgeois economists so extensively idealise the
      “peasantry”. Speaking “generally”, the peasants in
      the three villages mentioned are very prosperous; but even from Hecht’s
      far from thorough monograph it is apparent that in this respect the
      peasants must be divided into three large groups. About one-fourth (or 30
      per cent) of the farmers (the majority in Friedrichsthal and a few in
      Blankenloch) are prosperous petty bourgeois, who have grown rich as a
      result of living in the vicinity of the capital. They engage in
      remunerative dairy farming (selling

    

      10-20 litres of milk a day) and tobacco growing (one example: gross income
      of 1,825 marks from 1.05 hectares of land under tobacco), fatten pigs for
      sale (in Friedrichsthal, 497 out of 1,140 inhabitants keep pigs; in
      Blankenloch, 445 out of 1,684; and in Hagsfeld, 220 out of 1,273
      inhabitants), etc. This minority (who alone possess all the features of
      “prosperity” so much admired by the Critics) are without doubt
      quite frequent employers of hired labour. In the next group, to which the
      majority of farmers in Blankenloch belong, standards are very much lower,
      less fertilisers is used, the yield is lower, there is less livestock (in
      Friedrichsthal, the number of livestock, expressed in terms of cattle, is
      599 head on 258 hectares; in Blankenloch, 842 head on 736 hectares; and in
      Hagsfeld, 324 head on 397 hectares); “parlours” are more
      rarely seen in the houses, meat is far from being a daily fare, and many
      families practise (what is so familiar to us Russians) the selling of
      grain in the autumn—when they are hard pressed for money—and
      the re-purchasing of grain in the

      spring.[3]

      In this group, the centre of gravity is constantly shifting from
      agriculture to industry, and 103 Blankenloch peasants are already
      employed as factory workers in Karlsruhe. These, together with almost the
      entire population of Hagsfeld, form the third category (40-50 per cent of
      the total number of farms). In this category, agriculture is a side line
      in which mostly women are engaged. The standard of living is higher than
      in Blankenloch (the result of the influence of the capital city), but
      poverty is strongly felt. The peasants sell their milk and for themselves
      sometimes purchase “cheaper margarine” (S. 24). The number of
      goats kept is rapidly increasing: from nine in 1855 to ninety-three in
      1893. “This increase,” writes Hecht, “can be explained only by
      the disappearance of farms that are strictly speaking peasant farms, and
      the break-up [Auflösung] of the peasant

    

      class into a class of rural factory workers possessing extremely small
      plots of land” (S. 27). Parenthetically, it should be said that
      between 1882 and 1895 the number of goats in Germany increased enormously:
      from 2,400,000 to 3,100,000, which clearly reveals the reverse of the
      progress of the “sturdy peasantry” which the Bulgakovs and the
      petty-bourgeois socialist “Critics” laud to the skies. The
      majority of the workers walk three and a half kilometres every day to
      their factory in the town, because they cannot afford to spend even one
      mark (48 kopeks) a week on railway fares. Nearly 150 workers out of the
      300 in Hagsfeld find it beyond their means to pay even 40 or 50 pfennigs
      for dinner in the “public dining- room” and have their dinners
      brought to them from home. “Punctually at eleven o’clock,” writes
      Hecht, “the poor womenfolk put the dinners in their pots and carry
      them to the factory” (S. 79). As for the working women, they, too,
      work at the factory ten hours a day, and all they receive for their toil
      is from 1.10 to 1.50 marks (the men receive 2.50 to 2.70 marks); at
      piece-work they earn from 1.70 to 2.00 marks. “Some of the working
      women try to supplement their meagre wages by some auxiliary
      employment. In Blankenloch four girls work at the paper mill in Karlsruhe,
      and they take home paper to make bags at night. Working from eight
      p. m. to eleven p. m. [sic!], they can make 300 bags, for which
      they receive 45-50 pfennigs; this supplement to their small daily earnings
      goes to pay their railway fares to and from work. In Hagsfeld, several
      women who worked in factories as girls earn a little extra money polishing
      silverware on winter evenings” (S. 36). “The Hagsfeld worker,”
      says Hecht, moved, “has a permanent residence not by imperial order,
      but as a result of his own efforts; he has a little house which he is not
      compelled to share with others, and a small plot of land. But more
      important than these real possessions is the consciousness that they have
      been acquired by his own diligence. The Hagsfeld worker is both a factory
      worker and a peasant. Those with no land of their own rent at least a few
      strips to supplement their income by working in their spare time.
      In the summer, when work in the factory starts only [“only”!] at
      seven o’clock, the worker rises at four in order to hoe potatoes in his
      field, or to carry fodder to the cattle. Or when he returns from work at
      seven in the evening, what is

    

      there for him to do, especially in the summer? Well, he puts in an hour or an
      hour and a half in his field; he does not want a high rent from his
      land—he merely wants to make full use [sic!] of his
      labour-power...." Hecht goes on at great length in this unctuous strain and
      concludes his book with the words: “The dwarf peasant and the factory
      worker have both [sic!] raised themselves to the position of the
      middle class, not as a result of artificial and coercive measures, but as a
      result of their own diligence, their own energy, and the higher morality they
      have

      reached.” [4]


      “The three villages of the Baden Hard now represent one great and
broad middle class” (Hecht’s italics).
    

      There is nothing astonishing in the fact that Hecht writes, in this vein,
      for he is a bourgeois apologist of the common or garden variety. But what
      name do those people deserve who, to deceive others, call themselves
      socialists, who paint reality in still brighter colours than does Hecht,
      point to the prosperity of the bourgeois minority as general progress, and
      conceal the proletarisation of the majority with the stale shibboleth
      “unification of agriculture and industry”?
    
 

Notes
 

[1]

      Chapters V-IX were published in the magazine Obrazovaniye with
      the following note by the author: “These essays were written in
      1901. The first part was published in pamphlet form last year In Odessa
      [by Burevestnik (Storm Petrel) Publishers]. The second

   

part appears in
      print for the first time. Each essay is a more or less independent
      whole. Their common theme is the analysis of the criticism of Marxism in
      Russian literature.”—Ed.
    

[2]

      Incidentally, Mr. Chernov assures the readers of Russkoye
      Bogatstvo that there is “hardly any noticeable
      difference” in the size of the farms in those villages. But
      if the demand for details is not an empty phrase on his lips, he cannot
      forget that for these suburban peasants the amount of land is of much less
      importance than the amount of fertilisers used; and in this respect the
      difference is extremely marked. The yields are highest and the peas ants
      most prosperous in the village of Friedrichsthal, although the land area
      in that village is the smallest. This village, farming 258 hectares of
      land, spends 28,000 out of the total of 48,000

   

marks spent on fertilisers,
      which amounts to 108 marks per hectare. Hagsfeld spends only 30 marks per
      hectare (12,000 marks for 397 hectares), while Blankenloch spends only 11
      marks per hectare (8,000 marks for 736 hectares).
    —Lenin

[3]

      Incidentally, Hecht explains the economic backwardness of Blankenloch by
      the predominance of natural economy and the existence of common
      lands which guarantees to every person on reaching the age of 32 a
      strip of land (Allmendgut) of 36 arcs (1
      are=0.01 hectare.—Ed.), irrespective of whether he
      is “lazy or diligent, thrifty or otherwise” (S. 30). Hecht,
      for all that, is opposed to dividing up the common lands. This, he says,
      is a sort of public charity institution (Altersversorgung) for
      aged factory workers, whose numbers are increasing in Blankenloch.
    —Lenin

[4]

      Hecht says very much more about this “higher morality”, and no
      less than Mr. Bulgakov waxes enthusiastic over the “sober marital
      policy”, the “iron diligence”, the “thrift”,
      and the “temperance”; lie even quotes a “well-known
      peasant proverb”: Man sieht nicht auf die Goschen (d. h. Mund),
      sondern auf die Groschen, which freely translated means: We work, not
      so much for our mouths as for our pockets. We suggest that our readers
      compare this proverb with the “doctrine” of the Kiev
      professor, Bulgakov: that peasant farming (since it seeks neither rent nor
      profit) is “the most advantageous form of organisation of
      agriculture that society [sic!] can have” (Bulgakov, 1, 154).

    VI
The Productivity of a Small And a Big Farm. An
      Example From East Prussia

      For a change let us go from distant South Germany to East Prussia, nearer
      to Russia. We have before us a highly instructive and detailed
      investigation of which Mr. Bulgakov, who clamours so loudly for details,
      has been totally unable to make use. “A comparison of the data on
      the real

    

      productivity of large and small farms,” writes Mr. Bulgakov, “cannot
      provide an answer to the question of their technical advantages, since the
      farms compared may be operating under different economic conditions. The
      most that can be obtained from such data is the factual confirmation of
      the negative conclusion that large-scale production possesses no technical
      advantages over small-scale production, not only theoretically, but, under
      certain conditions, also practically. Quite a few comparisons of this kind
      have been made in economic literature, at all events sufficient to
      undermine the belief of the unbiased and unprejudiced reader in the
      advantages of large-scale production generally” (I, 57-58). In a
      footnote the author cites two instances. The first is Auhagen’s work,
      quoted by Kautsky in his Agrarfrage (S. Ill), as well as
      by Hertz (S. 69, Russian translation, p. 166), in which a
      comparison is made only between two farms in Hanover, one of 4.6 hectares
      and one of 26.5 hectares. In this example, the small farm has a higher
      yield per hectare than the large one, and Auhagen determined the income of
      the small farm to be higher than that of the large farm. Kautsky, however,
      has shown that this higher income is the result of
      under-consumption. Hertz attempted to refute this evidence, but
      with his usual success. Since Hertz’ work has now been translated into
      Russian, while Kautsky’s reply to Hertz is unknown in Russia, we shall,
      very briefly, give the substance of this reply (in the cited article in
      Neue Zeit). Hertz, as usual, distorted Kautsky’s arguments and
      alleged that he referred only to the fact that the owner of the big farm
      is able to send his son to the Gymnasium. In actuality, Kautsky mentioned
      this merely to illustrate the standard of living, and had Hertz quoted
      in full the budgets of the two families in question (each
      consisting of five persons), he would have obtained the following figures:
      1,158.40 marks for the small farm and 2,739.25 marks for the large
      farm. If the family of the small farm lived on the same standard
      as that of the large farm, the small farm would prove less
      profitable than the large one. Auhagen estimates the income of the small
      farm at 1,806 marks, i.e., 5.45 per cent of the capital invested (33,651
      marks), and that of the large farm at 2,720 marks, or 1.82 per cent of the
      capital invested (149,559 marks). If we make allowance for the
      under-consumption of the small

    

      farmer, we shall find that his income is equal to 258 marks, or
      0.80 per cent! And this, when the amount of labour involved is
      disproportionately high: on the small farm there are three workers to 4.6
      hectares, that is, one worker to 1.5 hectares, while on the large farm
      there are eleven (see Hertz, S. 75, Russian translation, p. 179)
      to 26.5 hectares, that is one worker to 2.4 hectares. Furthermore, we
      shall not dwell on the circumstance, justly ridiculed by Kautsky, that the
      alleged socialist Hertz compares the labour of the children of modern
      peasants to

      Ruth’s[8]

      gleaning! Mr. Bulgakov confines himself merely to presenting the figures
      of the yield per hectare, but says not a word about the
      respective standards of living of the small and big farmers.
    

      “We find another example,” continues our advocate of details,
      “in the latest researches of Karl Klawki (Ueber Kon
      kurrenzfähigkeit des landwirtschaftlichen Kleinbetriebs. Thiel’s
      Landwirtschaftliche Jahrbücher, 1899, Heft

      3-4).[1]

      His examples are taken from East Prussia. The author compares large,
      medium, and small farms by taking four of each kind. The specific feature
      of his comparisons is, first, the fact that expenditure and income are
      expressed in money, and, secondly, the fact that the author translates the
      cost of labour-power on the small farms, where it is not purchased, into
      money and places it to the expenditure account; such a method is hardly
      correct for our purpose [sic! Mr. Bulgakov forgets to add that
      Klawki translates the cost of labour on all the farms into money
      and from the outset values the labour on the small farms at a lower
      rate!]. Nevertheless, we have...."  There follows a table which for the
      moment we shall merely summarise: the average net profit per morgen ( =
      1/4 hectare) on the large farm is ten marks, on the medium farm, eighteen
      marks, on the small farm, twelve marks. And Mr. Bulgakov concludes:
      “The highest profits are obtained on the medium farms; then come the
      small farms, while the large farms lag behind the others.”
    

      We have seen fit to quote the entire passage in which Mr. Bulgakov
      compares the large and small farms. Now let us consider what is evidenced by
      Klawki’s interesting work,

    

      120 pages of which are devoted to a description of twelve typical farms
      existing under equal conditions. In the first place, we shall cite the
      statistics pertaining to these farms, and in the interest of space and
      clarity we shall confine ourselves to the average figures for the
      large, medium, and small farms (the average size of the farms in each
      category being 358, 50, and 5 hectares respectively).

      It would appear, therefore, that all Mr. Bulgakov’s conclusions
      are fully confirmed by Klawki’s work: the smaller the farm, the higher the
      gross income and the higher even the income from sales per morgen! We
      think that with the methods employed by Klawki—widely employed
      methods, in their main features common to all bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois economists—the superiority of small-scale farming in
      all or nearly all cases is proved. Consequently, the essential
      thing in this matter, which the Voroshilovs completely fail to see,
      is to analyse those methods, and it is for this reason that
      Klawki’s partial researches are of such enormous general interest.
    

      Let us start with the yields. It turns out that the yield of the great majority
      of cereals regularly and very considerably

    

      diminishes with the diminution of the area of the farms. The yield (in
      centners per morgen) on the large, medium, and small farms respectively is:
      wheat 8.7, 7.3, 6.4; rye 9.9, 8.7, 7.7; barley 9.4, 7.1, 6.5; oats 8.5, 8.7,
      8.0; peas 8.0, 7.7,

      9.2; [3]

      potatoes 63, 55, 42; mangels 190, 156, 117. Only of
      flax, not grown on the large farms, do the small farms (3 out of 4) gather a
      bigger yield than the medium farms (2 out of 4), namely, 6.2 Stein
      (=18.5 pounds) as against 5.5.
    

      To what is the higher yield on the large farms due? Klawki ascribes decisive
      importance to the following four causes:

      (1) Drainage is almost entirely absent on the small farms, and even where it
      exists the drain pipes are laid by the farmer himself and laid badly. (2)
      The small farmers do not plough their land deep enough, their horses being
      weak.

      (3) Most often the small farmers are unable to give their cattle sufficient
      fodder.

      (4) The small farmers have inferior manure, their straw is shorter,
      it is largely used as fodder (which also means that the feed is inferior),
      and less straw is used for bedding.
    

      Thus, the small farmers’ cattle is weaker and inferior, and is kept in a
      worse condition. This circumstance explains the strange and glaring
      phenomenon that, notwithstanding the higher yield per morgen on the large
      farms, income from agriculture per morgen, according to Klawki’s
      computations, is less on the large than on the medium and small farms. The
      reason for this is that Klawki does not include fodder, either in
      disbursement or in income. In this way, things that in reality make for an
      essential difference between the large and small farms, a difference
      unfavourable to the latter, are artificially and falsely equated. By this
      method of computation large-scale farming appears to be less remunerative
      than small-scale farming, because a larger portion of the land of
      the large farms is devoted to the cultivation of fodder (although the
      large farms keep a much smaller number of cattle per unit of land),
      whereas the small farmers “make shift” with straw for
      fodder. Consequently, the “superiority"of small- scale farming lies
      in its wasteful exploitation of the land (by inferior
      fertilisation) and of the cattle (by inferior fodder).

    

      Needless to say, such a comparison of the profitableness of different
      farms lacks all scientific

      value.[4]


      Another reason for the higher yield on large farms is that a larger number
      of the big farmers (and apparently, even, almost they alone) marl the
      soil, utilise larger quantities of artificial fertilisers (the expenditure
      per morgen being:

      0.81 marks, 0.38 marks, and 0.43 marks respectively) and

      Kraftfuttermittel[5]

      (in large farms two marks per morgen, and in the others nil). “Our
      peasant farms,” says Klawki, who includes the medium farms in the category
      of large peas ant farms, “spend nothing on
      Kraftfuttermittel. They are very slow to adopt progressive
      methods and are particularly chary of spending cash” (Klawki,
      op. cit., 461). The large farms are superior also in the method of
      cultivating the soil:

      we observe improved crop rotation on all four of the large farms, on three
      of the medium farms (on one the old three- field system is used), and only
      on one of the small farms (on the other three the three-field system is
      used). Finally, the big farmers use machinery to a far greater
      extent. True, Klawki himself is of the opinion that machinery is of no
      great consequence, but we shall not be satisfied with that
      “opinion”; we shall examine the statistics. The following
      eight kinds of machines—steam threshers, horse threshers,
      grain-sorting machines, sifters, seed-drills, manure spreaders,
      horse-drawn rakes, and rollers—are distributed among the farms
      described, as follows: on the four large farms, twenty nine (including one
      steam thresher); on the four medium farms, eleven (not a single
      steam-driven machine); and on the four small farms, one machine (a
      horse-driven thresher).

    

      Of course, no “opinion” of any admirer of peasant farming can
      make us believe that grain-sorting machines, seed-drills, rollers, etc.,
      do not affect the size of the crop. Incidentally, we have here data on
      machines belonging to certain definite owners, unlike the general run of
      German statistics, which register only cases of the use of machines,
      whether owned or hired. Obviously, such a registration will also have the
      effect of minimising the superiority of large-scale farming and of
      obscuring forms of “borrowing” machines, like the following
      described by Klawki: “The big farmer willingly lends the small
      farmer his roller, horse rake, and grain-sorting machine, if the latter
      promises to supply a man to do the mowing for him in the busy
      season” (443). Consequently, a certain number of the cases in which
      machines are employed on small farms, which, as we have shown, are rare,
      represent a transmuted form of acquiring labour-power.
    

      To continue. Another case of erroneous comparison of obviously unequal
      quantities is Klawki’s method of computing the price of the product on the
      market as being equal for all categories of farms. Instead of taking
      actual transactions, the author takes as a basis an assumption that be
      himself points to as incorrect. The peasants sell most of their grain in
      their own locality, and merchants in small towns force down prices very
      considerably. “The large estates are better off in this respect, for
      they can send grain to the principal city in the province in considerable
      quantities. In doing so, they usually receive from 20 to 30 pfennigs more
      per centner than they could get in the small town” (373). The big
      farmers are better able to assess the value of their grain (451), and they
      sell it, not by measure, as the peasants do to their disadvantage, but by
      weight. Similarly, the big farmers sell their cattle by weight, whereas
      the price of the peasants’ cattle is fixed simply on the basis of outer
      appearance. The big farmers can also make better arrangements for selling
      their dairy products, for they can send their milk to the towns and obtain
      a higher price than the middle farmers, who convert their milk into butter
      and sell it to merchants. Moreover, the butter produced on the medium
      farms is superior to that produced on the small farms (use of separators,
      daily churning, and so forth), and the latter get from five to ten
      pfennigs per pound less. The small farmers have to

    

      sell their fat stock sooner (i.e., less matured) than the middle farmers,
      because they have a smaller supply of fodder (444). Klawki, in his
      monograph, leaves out of his calculations all these advantages—in
      their totality by no means unimportant—which the large farms possess
      as sellers, just as the theoreticians who admire small-scale farming leave
      out this fact and refer to the possibility of improving
      matters by means of co-operation. We do not wish to confound the realities
      of capitalism with the possibilities of a petty-bourgeois co-operative
      paradise. Below we shall bring forward facts showing who really
      derives the most advantage out of co-operatives.
    

      Let us note that Klawki “is not concerned with” the labour of
      the small and middle farmers themselves in draining the soil and in all
      kinds of repair work (“the peasants do the work themselves”), and so
      forth. The socialist calls this “advantage” enjoyed by the
      small farmer Ueberarbeit, overwork, and the bourgeois economist
      refers to it as one of the advantageous aspects (“for
      society”!) of peasant farming. Let us note that, as Klawki points
      out, the hired labourers get better pay and food on the medium farms than
      on the large farms, but they work harder: the “example” set by
      the farmer stimulates “greater diligence and thoroughness”
      (465). Which of these two capitalist masters—the landlord or his
      “own kind”, the peasant—squeezes more work out of the
      labourer for the given wages, Klawki does not attempt to determine. We
      shall therefore confine ourselves to stating that the expenditure of the
      big farmers on accident and old-age insurance for their labourers amounts
      to 0.29 marks per morgen and that of the middle farmer to 0.13 marks (the
      small farmer here, too, enjoys an advantage in that he does not insure
      himself at all; needless to say, to the “great advantage of the
      society” of capitalists and landlords). We shall also bring an
      example from Russian agricultural capitalism. The reader who is familiar
      with Shakhovskoi’s work Outside Agricultural Employment will
      probably remember the following characteristic observation: The Russian
      homestead farmers and the German colonists (in the south)
      “pick” their labourers, pay them from 15 to 20 per cent more
      than do the big employers and squeeze 50 per cent more work out of
      them. This was reported by Shakhovskoi in 1896; this year we read

    

      in Torgovo-Promyshlennaya

Gazeta, [Commercial and Industrial
  Gazette.—Tr.]

      for instance, the following communication from Kakhovka: "...The
      peasants and homestead farmers, as is the custom, paid higher wages (than
      those paid on the big estates), for they demand better workers and those
      possessing the greatest endurance” (No. 109, May 16, 1901). There
      are hardly grounds for assuming that this condition is characteristic of
      Russia alone.
    

      In the table given above the reader saw two methods of
      computation—one that takes into account the money value of the
      farmer’s labour-power, and one that does not. Mr. Bulgakov considers that
      to include this money value “is hardly correct”. Of course, a
      precise budget of the farmers’ and labourers’ expenditure, in money and in
      kind, would be far more correct; but since we lack these data, we are
      obliged to make an approximate estimate of the family’s money
      expenditure. The manner in which Klawki makes this approximation
      is extremely interesting. The big estate-owners do not work themselves, of
      course; they even have special salaried managers who carry out all the
      work of direction and supervision (of four estates, three are supervised
      by managers and one is not; Klawki would consider it more correct to
      classify this last estate, consisting of 125 hectares, as a large peasant
      estate). Klawki “assigns” to the owners of two large estates
      2,000 marks per annum each “for their labour” (which on the
      first estate, for instance, consists of leaving the principal estate once
      a month for a few days’ check-up on the manager’s work). To the account of
      the farmer of 125 hectares (the first-mentioned estate consisted of 513
      hectares) he “assigns” only 1,900 marks for the work of the
      farmer himself and of his three sons. Is it not “natural” that
      a farmer with a smaller amount of land should “make shift”
      with a smaller budget? Klawki allows the middle farmers from 1,200 to
      1,716 marks for the labour of the husband and wife, and in three cases
      also of the children. To the small farmers he allows from 800 to 1,000
      marks for the work of four to five (sic!)  persons, i.e., a
      little more (if more at all) than a labourer, an Instmann, gets,
      who with his family earns only from 800 to 900 marks. Thus, we observe
      here another big step forward: first, a comparison is made between figures
      that are
      obviously uncomparable; now it is declared that the standard of living
      must decline with the diminution in the size of the farm. But
      that means the a priori recognition of the fact that capitalism
      degrades the small peasants, a fact ostensibly to have been refuted by the
      computations of the “net profit”!
    

      And if, by the author’s assumption, the money income diminishes
      with the diminution in the size of the farm, the drop in consumption is
      evident by direct data. Consumption of agricultural products on the farms
      amounts to the following per person (counting two children as one adult):
      large farm, 227 marks (average of two figures); medium farm, 218 marks
      (average of four figures); small farm, 135 (sic!) marks (average
      of four figures). And the larger the farm, the larger is the quantity of
      additional food products purchased (S. 453). Klawki himself observes that
      here it is necessary to raise the question of Unterkonsumption
      (under-consumption), which Mr. Bulgakov denied, and which here he
      preferred to ignore, thus proving to be even more of an apologist
      than Klawki. Klawki seeks to minimise the significance of this
      fact. “Whether there is any under-consumption among the small
      farmers or not, we cannot say,” he states, “but we think it is
      probable in the case of small farm IV [97 marks per head]. The fact is
      that the small peasants live very frugally [!] and sell much of what they,
      so to speak, save out of their mouths” (sick sozusagen vom Munde

absparen).[6]

      He attempts
      to prove that this fact does not refute the higher “productivity”
      of small-scale farming. If consumption were increased to 170 marks, which is
      quite adequate (for the “younger

      brother”,[9]
    

      but not for the capitalist. farmer, as we see), the figure for consumption
      per morgen would have to be increased and the income from sales reduced by
      six or seven marks. If this amount is subtracted (see table above), we get
      from 29 to 30 marks, i.e., a sum still larger than that obtained on the
      large. farms (S. 453). But if we increase consumption, not to this
      haphazardly-taken figure (and a low one at that, because “he’ll
      manage somehow”), but to 218 marks (equal to the actual figure on the
      medium farms), the income from the sale of products will drop on the small
      farms to 20 marks per morgen, as against 29 marks on the medium
      farms, and 25 marks on the large farms. That is to say, the correction of
      this one error (of the numerous errors indicated above) in
      Klawki’s computations destroys all the “advantages”
      of the small peasant.
    

      But Klawki is untiring in his quest of advantages. The small peasants
      “combine agriculture with industrial occupations”: three small
      peasants (out. of four) “diligently work as day-labourers and receive
      board in addition to their pay” (435). But the advantages of small-scale
      farming are particularly marked during periods of crisis (as Russian readers
      have long known from the numerous exercises on this theme on the part of the
      Narodniks, now rehashed by the Chernovs):

      “During agricultural crises, as well as at other times, it is the
      small farms that possess the greatest stability, they are able to sell a
      relatively larger quantity of products than the other categories of farms
      by severely curtailing domestic expenses, which, it is true, must lead to
      a certain amount of under-consumption” (479—Klawki’s last
      conclusions; cf. S. 464). “Unfortunately, many small farms are
      reduced to this by the high rates of interest on loans. But in this way,
      although with great effort, they are able to keep on their feet and eke
      out a livelihood. Probably, it is the great diminution in consumption that
      chiefly explains the increase in the number of small peasant farms in our
      locality indicated in the statistics of the Empire.” And Klawki adduces
      figures for the Königsberg

      Regierungsbezirk, [Königsberg
Administrative Area.—Ed.]

      where in the period between 1882 and 1895 the number
      of farms under two hectares increased

    

      from 56,000 to 79,000, those from two to five hectares from 12,000 to
      14,000, and those from five to twenty hectares from 16,000 to 19,000. This
      is in East Prussia, the very place in which the Bulgakovs claim to see the
      “elimination” of large-scale by small-scale production. And
      yet the gentlemen who give the bare statistics of the area of farms in
      this

      Suzdal[10]

      fashion clamour for “details”!  Naturally, Klawki considers that
      “the most important task of modern agrarian policy for the solution
      of the agricultural labourer problem in the East is to encourage the most
      efficient labourers to settle down by affording them the opportunity of
      acquiring a piece of land as their own property, if not in the first, then
      at least in the second [sic!] generation” (476). It doesn’t
      matter that the Instleute who purchase a plot of land out of
      their savings “in the majority of cases prove to be worse off
      financially; they are fully aware of this themselves, but they are tempted
      by the greater freedom”, and the main task of bourgeois political
      economy (now, apparently, of the “Critics” also) is to foster
      this illusion among the most backward section of the proletariat.
    

      Thus, on every point Klawki’s inquiry refutes Mr. Bulgakov, who referred
      to Klawki. This inquiry demonstrates the technical superiority of
      large-scale production in agriculture, the overwork and under-consumption
      of the small peasant and his transformation into a regular or day-labourer
      for the landlord; it proves that there is a connection be tween the
      increase in the number of small peasant farms and the growth of poverty
      and proletarisation. Two conclusions that follow from this inquiry are of
      exceptional significance from the point of view of principle. First, we
      see clearly the obstacle to the introduction of machinery in agriculture:

      the abysmal degradation of the small farmer, who is ready to “leave
      out of account” his own toil and who makes manual labour cheaper for
      the capitalist than machinery. Mr. Bulgakov’s assertions notwithstanding,
      the facts prove incontestably that under the capitalist system the
      position of the small peasant in agriculture is in every way
      analogous to that of the handicraftsman in industry. Mr. Bulgakov’s
      assertions notwithstanding, we see in agriculture a still further
      diminution in consumption and a still further intensification of labour
      employed as methods of competing with large-scale

    

      production. Secondly, in regard to every manner of comparison between t.he
      remunerativeness of small and large farms, we must once and for all
      declare as absolutely useless and vulgarly apologetic any conclusion that
      leaves out of account the following three circumstances: (1) How does the
      farmer eat, live, and work? (2) How are the cattle kept
      and worked? (3) How is the land fertilised, and is it exploited
      in a rational manner? Small-scale farming manages to exist by methods of
      sheer waste—waste of the farmer’s labour and vital energy, waste of
      strength and quality of the cattle, and waste of the productive capacities
      of the land. Consequently, any inquiry that fails to examine these
      circumstances thoroughly is nothing more nor less than bourgeois

      sophistry.[7]


      It is not surprising, therefore, that the “theory” of the overwork
      and under-consumption of the small peasants in modern society has been so
      severely attacked by Messrs. the Critics. In Nachalo (No. 1.,
      p. 10) Mr. Bulgakov “undertook” to give any number of
      “citations” disproving Kautsky’s assertions.

    

      From the studies of the League for Social and Political

      Questions,[11]
Bäuerliche Zustände (Conditions of the
      Peasantry), repeats Mr. Bulgakov, “Kautsky, in his attempt to
      galvanise the corpse [sic!] of the obsolete dogma back to life,
      selected certain facts showing the depressed condition of peasant farming,
      which is quite understandable at the present time. Let the reader look for
      himself; he will find evidence there of a somewhat different
      character” (II, 282). Let us “look” for ourselves and
      verify the quotations given by this strict scientist, who, in part, merely
      repeats Hertz’ quotations (S. 77, Russian translation, p. 183).
    

      “From Eisenach comes evidence of improvements in stock-breeding, in
      soil fertilisation, evidence of the use of machinery, and in general of
      progress in agricultural production.... We turn to the article on Eisenach
      (Bäuerliche Zustände, I. Band). The condition of the
      owners of less than five hectares (of which there are 887 out of the 1,116
      farms in this district) “is, in general, not very favourable”
      (66). “Insofar as they can work for the big farmers as reapers,
      day-labourers, etc., their condition is relatively good...”
      (67). Generally speaking, important technological progress has been made
      in the past twenty years, but “much is left to be desired,
      particularly in regard to the smaller farms...” (72). “...the smaller
      farmers sometimes employ weak cows for field work....” Subsidiary earnings
      derive from tree felling and carting firewood; the latter “takes the
      farmers away from agriculture” and leads to “worsened
      conditions...” (69). “Nor does tree felling provide adequate
      earnings, in some districts the small landowners
      [Grundstücksbesitzer] engage in weaving, which is miserably
      [leidlich] paid. In isolated cases work is obtained at
      cigar-making at home. Generally speaking, there is a shortage of
      subsidiary earnings..."  (73). And the author, Ökonomie Commissar
      Dittenberger, concludes with the remark that, in view of their
      “simple lives” and their “modest requirements”,
      the peasants are strong and healthy, which “is astonishing,
      considering the low nutritive value of the food consumed by the poorest
      class, among whom potatoes are the principal item of fare...” (74).
    

      That is how the “learned” Voroshilovs refute the
      “obsolete Marxist prejudice that peasant farming is incapable of
      technological progress”!
    
 

      In regard to the Kingdom of Saxony, General Secretary Langsdorff says that
      in whole districts, particularly in the more fertile localities, there is
      now hardly any difference in intensiveness of cultivation between the
      large and the small estates”. That is how Kautsky is refuted by the
      Austrian Voroshilov (Hertz, S. 77, Russian translation, pp. 182-83),
      followed by the Russian Voroshilov (Bulgakov, II, 282, referring to
      Bäuerliche Zustände, II, 222). We turn to page 222 of
      the book from which the Critics cite, and following the words quoted by
      Hertz we read: “The difference is more marked in the hilly
      districts, where the bigger estates operate with a relatively large
      working capital. But here, too, very frequently, the peasant farms realise
      a no lesser net profit than do the large farms, since the smaller income
      is compensated by greater frugality, which at the prevailing very low
      level of requirements [bei der vorhandenen grossen
      Bedürfnisslosigkeit] is carried to such lengths that the
      condition of the peasant is very often worse than that of the industrial
      worker, who has become accustomed to greater requirements”
      (Bäuerliche Zustände, II, 222). We read further that
      the prevailing system of land cultivation is crop rotation, which has
      become the predominant system among the middle farmers, while “the
      three-field system is met with almost exclusively among the small
      peasant-owned estates”. In regard to stock-breeding, progress is
      also observed everywhere. “Only in regard to the raising of horned
      cattle and the utilisation of dairy products does the peasant usually lag
      behind the big land lord” (223).
    

      “Professor Ranke,” continues Mr. Bulgakov, “testifies to the
      technological advance in peasant farming in the environs of Munich, which,
      he says, is typical for the whole of Upper Bavaria.” We turn to Ranke’s
      article: Three Grossbauer communities farming with the aid of
      hired labourers— 69 peasants out of 119 hold more than 20 hectares
      each, comprising three-fourths of the land. Moreover, 38 of these
      “peasants” hold more than 40 hectares each, with an average of
      59 hectares each; between them they hold nearly 60 per cent of the entire
      land....
    

      We think this should suffice to reveal the manner in which
      Messrs. Bulgakov and Hertz “quote”.

      It should be noted that a similarly false equation of obviously unequal
      quantities in small- and large-scale farming is to be found, not only in
      separate monographs, but in the great bulk of contemporary agrarian
      statistics. Both French and German statistics deal with
      “average” live weight and “average” price per head
      of cattle in all categories of farms. German statistics go so far in this
      method as to define the gross value of the whole of the cattle in various
      categories of farms (classified according to area). At the same time,
      however, the reservation is made that the presumed equal value per head of
      cattle in different categories of farms “does not correspond to the
      reality” (S. 35).

      It is interesting to note, for example, that the income from the sale of
      milk and butter on the large farms amounts to seven marks per morgen, on
      the medium farms three marks, and on the small farms seven
      marks. The point is, however, that the small peasants consume “very
      little butter and whole milk ... while the inhabitants of small farm IV
      [on which the consumption of products produced on the farm amounts to only
      97 marks per head] do not consume these items at all” (450). Let the
      reader compare this fact (which, by the way, has long been known to all
      except the “Critics”) with Hertz’ grand reasoning (S. 113, Russian
      translation, p. 270): “But does the peasant get nothing for his
      milk?” “Who, in the end, eats the [milk-fed!] pig? Not the peasant?”
      These utterances should be recalled more often as an unexcelled example of
      the most vulgar embellishment of poverty.

      Leo Huschke, in his work, Landwirtschaftliche Reinertrags-Berechnungen bei
Klein-, Mittel- und Grossbetrieb dargelegt an typischen Beispielen
Mittelthüringens [Assessment of Net Incomes of Small, Medium, and Large
Farms, Based on Typical Examples from Middle Thuringia.—Ed.]
      (Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1902), justly points out that “it is possible by
      merely reducing the assessment” of the small farmer’s labour-power to
      obtain a computation that will prove his superiority over the middle and the
      big farmer, and his ability to compete with them (S.
      126). Unfortunately, the author did not carry his idea to its logical
      conclusion, and therefore did not present systematic data showing the manner
      in which the cattle were kept, the method of fertilising the soil, and the
      cost of maintaining the farmer’s household in the various categories of
      farms. We hope to return to Herr Huschke’s interesting work. For the moment we
      shall merely note his reference to the fact that small-scale farming fetches
      lower prices for its products than large-scale farming (S. 146, 155),
      and his conclusion that: “The small and medium farms strove to overcome
      the crisis which set in after 1892 (the fall in the prices of agricultural
      produce) by cutting down cash expenditure as much as possible, while the large
      farms met the crisis through increasing their yields by means of increased
      expenditure on their farms” (S. 144). Expenditure on seeds,
      fodder, and fertilisers in the period from 1887-91 to 893-97 was reduced on
      the small and medium farms, and increased on the large farms. On the small
      farms, this expenditure amounted to seventeen marks per hectare, and on the
      large farms to. forty-four marks. (Author’s note to the 1908
      edition—Ed.)

    VII
The Inquiry Into Peasant Farming In Baden

      “Due to lack of space,” writes Hertz, “we cannot render the
      detailed and interesting judgements of the Inquiry into 37 communities in
      Baden. In the majority of cases they are analogous to those presented
      above: side by side with favourable, we find unfavourable and indifferent
      judgements; but nowhere in these entire three volumes of the Inquiry
      do the detailed budgets of expenditure give any grounds for the conclusion
      that ’under-consumption’ (Unterkonsumption), ’sordid and degrading
      poverty’, etc., are prevalent” (S. 79; Russian translation,
      p. 188). The words we have emphasised represent, as usual, a direct
      untruth. The very Baden Inquiry to which Hertz refers contains
      documentary evidence at testing to
      “under-consumption” precisely among the small
      peasantry. Hertz’ distortion of the facts closely resembles the
      method that was especially cultivated by the Russian Narodniks and is now
      practised by all the “Critics” on the agrarian question, viz.,
      sweeping statements about “the peasantry”. Since the term
      “peasantry” is still more vague in the West than it is in
      Russia· (in the West this social-estate is not sharply defined),
      and since “average” facts and conclusions conceal the relative
      “prosperity” (or at all events, the absence of starvation)
      among the minority and the privation suffered by the majority, apologists
      of all sorts have an unlimited field of activity. In actual fact, the
      Baden Inquiry enables us to distinguish various groups of peasants, which
      Hertz, although an advocate of “details”, preferred not to
      see. Out of 37 typical communities, a selection was made of typical farms
      of big peasants (Gross batter), middle peasants, and small
      peasants, as well as of day-labourers, making a total of 70 peasants’ (31
      big, 21 middle, and 18 small) and 17 day-labourers’ households; and the
      budgets of these households were subjected to a very detailed
      examination. We have not been able to analyse all the data; but
      the principal results cited below will suffice to enable us to
      draw very definite conclusions.
    

      Let us first present the data on the general economic type of (a) large,
      (b). middle, and (c) small peasant farms (Anlage VI: “Uebersichtliche
Darstellung der Ergebnisse
    

      der in den Erhebungsgemeinden angestellten

Ertragsberechnungen.” [Appendix VI: “Brief
Review of the Results of the Assessment of Incomes in Communities
Investigated.”—Ed.  ]

      We have divided this table into groups for the Grossbauer,
      Mittelbauer, and Kleinbauer respectively). Size of
      holdings—average in each group: (a) 33.34 hectares, (b) 13.5
      hectares, and (c) 6.96 hectares—which is relatively high for a
      country of small land-holdings like Baden. But if we exclude the ten farms
      in communities Nos. 20, 22, and 30, where exceptionally large holdings are
      the rule (up to 43 hectares among the Kleinbauer and up to 170
      hectares among the Grossbauer!), we shall obtain the following
      figures, more normal for Baden: (a) 17.8 hectares, (b) 10.0 hectares, and
      (c) 4.25 hectares. Size of families:

      (a) 6.4 persons, (b) 5.8, and (c) 5.9. (Unless otherwise stated,. these
      and subsequent figures apply to all the 70 farms.) Consequently, the
      families of the big peasants are consider ably larger; nevertheless, they
      employ hired labour to a far greater extent than the others. Of the 70
      peasants, 54, i.e., more than three-fourths of the total, employ hired
      labour, namely: 29 big peasants (out of 31), 15 middle (out of 21), and 10
      small (out of 18). Thus, of the big peasants, 93 per cent cannot manage
      without hired labour, while the figure for the small peasants is 55 per
      cent. These figures are very useful as a test of the current opinion
      (accepted uncritically by the “Critics”) that the employment of
      hired labour is negligible in present-day peasant farming. Among the big
      peasants (whose farms of 18 hectares are included in the category of 5-20
      hectares, in wholesale descriptions reckoned as real peasant farms), we
      see pure capitalist farming:

      24 farms employ 71 labourers—almost 3 labourers per farm, and 27
      farmers employ day-labourers for a total of 4,347 days (161 man-days per
      farmer). Compare this with the size of the holdings of the big peasants in
      the environs of Munich, whose “progress” served our bold
      Mr. Bulgakov as a refutation of the “Marxist prejudice”
      regarding the degradation of the peasants by capitalism!
    

      For the middle peasants we have the following figures:

      8 employ 12 labourers, and 14 employ day-labourers for a total of 956
      man-days. For the small peasants: 2 employ

    

      2 labourers, and 9 employ day-labourers for a total of 543
      man-days. One-half the number of small peasants employ hired
      labour for 2 months (543:9=60 days), i.e., in the most important season
      for the farmers (notwithstanding the fact that their farms are larger, the
      production of these small peasants is very much lower than that of the
      Friedrichsthal peasants, of whom Messrs. Chernov, David, and Hertz are so
      enamoured).
    

      The results of this farming are as follows: 31 big peasants made a net
      profit of 21,329 marks and suffered a loss of 2,113 marks, i.e., a total
      profit for this category of 19,216 marks, or 619.9 marks per farm (523.5
      marks if 5 farms in communities Nos. 20, 22, and 30 are excluded). For the
      medium farms the corresponding amount will be 243.3 marks (272.2 marks, if
      the 3 communities are excluded), and for the small farms, 35.3 marks (37.1
      marks, if the 3 communities are excluded). Consequently, the small
      peasant, literally speaking, can barely make ends meet and only just
      manages to do so by cutting down consumption. The Inquiry
      (Ergebnisse, etc., in Vol. IV of

      Erhebungen,[7]

      S. 138) contains figures showing the consumption of the most
      important food items on each farm. Below we quote these data as averages
      for each category of peasants:

      These are the data in which our bold Hertz “failed to perceive” either under-consumption or poverty! We see that the small
      peasant, as compared with those of the higher groups, reduces his
      consumption very considerably, and

    

      that his food and clothing are little better than those of the
      day-labourer. For example, he consumes about two-thirds of the amount of
      meat consumed by the middle peasant, and about half the amount consumed by
      the big peasant. These figures prove once again the uselessness of
      sweeping conclusions and the erroneousness of all assessments of income
      that ignore differences in living standards. If, for instance, we take
      only the two last columns of our table (to avoid complicated
      calculations in translating food products into money terms), we shall see
      that the “net profit”, not only of the small peasant, but also
      of the middle peasant, is a pure fiction, which only pure
      bourgeois like Hecht and Klawki, or pure Voroshilovs like our Critics, can
      take seriously. Indeed, if we assume that the small peasant spends as much
      money on food as the middle peasant does, his expenditure would be
      increased by one hundred marks, and we would get an enormous
      deficit. If the middle peasant spent as much as the big peasant,
      his expenditure would be increased by 220 marks, and unless he
      “stinted himself” in food be, too, would sustain a

      deficit.[1]

      Does not the reduced consumption of the small peasant, following self-
      evidently from the inferior feeding of his cattle and the inadequate
      restoration (often the complete exhaustion) of the productivity of the
      soil, entirely confirm the truth of Marx’s words, at which the modern
      Critics merely shrug their shoulders in lofty contempt: “An infinite
      fragmentation

    

      of means of production, and isolation of the producers
      themselves. Monstrous waste of human energy. Progressive deterioration of
      conditions of production and increased prices of means of
      production—an inevitable law of proprietorship of parcels”
      (Das Kapital, III, 2,

S. 342).[8]


      In regard to the Baden Inquiry we must note still another distortion by
      Mr. Bulgakov (the Critics mutually supplement each other; while one
      distorts one aspect of the information adduced from a given source, a
      second distorts the other). Mr. Bulgakov frequently quotes from the Baden
      inquiry. It would appear, therefore, that he is acquainted with
      it. Yet we find him writing the following: “The exceptional and
      apparently fatal indebtedness of the peasant”—. so states the
      Overture, II, 271—"represents one of the most immutable dogmas in
      the mythology created in literature in relation to peasant
      farming.... Surveys at our disposal reveal considerable indebtedness only
      among the smallest, not yet firmly established holdings
      [Tagelöhnerstellen]. Thus, Sprenger expresses the general
      impression obtained from the results of the extensive investigation
      conducted in Baden [to which reference is made in a footnote] in the
      following manner: ’... Only the plots of the day-labourers and small
      peasant farmers are relatively speaking heavily mortgaged in a large
      number of the districts investigated; but even among these, in the
      majority of cases, the indebtedness is not so great as to cause
      alarm... "’ (272). A strange thing. On the one hand, there is
      reference to the Inquiry itself, and on the other, there is merely
      the quoted “general impression” of a certain Sprenger who has
      written about this Inquiry. But as ill-luck would have it, Sprenger’s
      writing falls short of the truth (at least in the passage quoted by
      Mr. Bulgakov; we have not read Sprenger’s book). First, the authors of the
      Inquiry assert that, in the majority of cases, it is precisely the
      indebtedness of the small peasant holdings which reaches alarming
      dimensions. Secondly, they assert that the position of the small peasants
      in this respect is not only worse than that of the middle and big peasants
      (which Sprenger noted) but also worse than that of the
      day-labourers.
    

      It must be observed in general that the authors of the Baden Inquiry
      established the extremely important fact that

    

      on the large farms the limits of permissible indebtedness (i.e.,
      the limits to which the farmer may go without risking bankruptcy) are
      higher than on the small farms. After the data we have presented
      above on the farming results obtained by the big, middle, and small
      peasants respectively, this fact requires no further explanation. The
      authors of the Inquiry estimate the indebtedness permissible and safe
      (unbedenklich) for the large and medium farms at 40-70 per cent
      of the land value, or an average of 55 per cent. In regard to the small
      farms (which they set as between our and seven hectares for crop
      cultivation, and between two and four hectares for viticulture and
      commercial crops), they consider that “the limits of indebtedness
      ... must not exceed 30 per cent of the value of the holding, if the
      regular payment of interest and of instalments on the principal
      is to be fully secured” (S. 66, B. IV). In the surveyed
      communities (with the exception of those where

      Anerbenrecht[2]

      prevails, e’.g., Unadingen and Neukirch), the percentage of indebtedness
      (in proportion to the value of the estate) steadily diminishes as we pass
      from the small to the large farms. In the community of Dittwar, for
      instance, the indebtedness of farms up to one-fourth of a hectare equals
      180.65 per cent; from one to two hectares, 73.07 per cent; from two to
      five hectares, 45.73 per cent; from five to ten hectares, 25.34 per cent;
      and from ten to twenty hectares, 3.02 per cent (ibid., S. 89-90). But the
      percentage of indebtedness does not tell us everything, and the authors of
      the Inquiry draw the following conclusion:
    

      “The above-given statistics, consequently, confirm the widespread
      opinion that those owners of peasant holdings who are on the border-line
      [in the middle] between the day- labourers and the middle peasants [in the
      rural districts the farmers of this category are usually called the
      “middle estate”—Mittelstand] are frequently in a
      worse position than those in the groups above or below [sic!] in
      the size of their holdings; for, although they are able to cope with
      moderate indebtedness, if it is kept at a certain and not very
      high level, they find it difficult to meet their obligations, being

    

      unable to obtain regular collateral employment (as day-
      labourers, etc.), by which means to increase their income...."
      Day-labourers, “insofar as they have some regular collateral
      employment, are frequently in a much better position materially than those
      belonging to the ’middle estate’, for, as computations in numerous cases
      have shown, collateral employment produces at times such a high net (i.e.,
      money) income as to enable them to repay even large debts”
      (op. cit.,

      67).[3]

      Finally, the authors reiterate that the indebtedness of
      the small peasant farms in relation to the permissible level is
      “sometimes unsafe”; hence, “in purchasing land,
      particular business-like caution must be exercised ... primarily by the
      small peasant population and by the day- labourers, closely
      related to it” (98).
    

      This, then, is the bourgeois counsellor to the small peasant! On the one
      hand, he fosters in the proletarians and semi-proletarians the hope that
      they will be able to purchase land, “if not in the first, then in
      the second generation”, and by diligence and abstemiousness obtain
      from it an enormous percentage of “net income”; on the other
      hand, he advises especially the poor peasants to exercise
      “particular caution” in purchasing land if they have no
      “regular employment”, that is to say, when the capitalists
      have no need for settled workers. And yet there are “critical”
      simpletons who accept these selfish lies and threadbare banalities as the
      findings of the most up-to-date science!
    


      One would think that the detailed data we have presented on the big,
      middle, and small peasants would suffice to make even Mr. V. Chernov
      understand the meaning of the term “petty bourgeois” as
      applied to the peasant, a term that seems to inspire him with such
      horror. Capitalist evolution has not only introduced similarity in the
      general economic system of West-European countries, but it has
      brought Russia also closer to the West, so that the main features
      of peasant farming in Germany are similar to those

    

      in Russia. However, in Russia the process of differentiation among the
      peasantry, abundantly confirmed in Russian Marxist literature, is in an
      initial stage; it has not yet assumed anything like a finished form, it
      has not yet given rise, for example, to the immediately noticeable,
      distinctive type of big peasant (Grossbauer). In Russia the mass
      expropriation and extinction of an enormous section of the peasantry still
      greatly overshadow the “first steps” of our peasant
      bourgeoisie. In the West, however, this process, which started even before
      the abolition of serfdom (cf. Kautsky, Agrarfrage, S. 27), long
      ago caused the obliteration of the social-estate distinction between
      peasant and “privately owned” (as we call it) farming, on the
      one hand, and the formation of a class of agricultural wage-workers, which
      has already acquired fairly definite features, on the

      other.[4]

      It would be a grave error to assume, however, that this process came to a
      stop after more or less definite new types of rural population had
      emerged. On the contrary, it goes on continuously, now rapidly, now
      slowly, of course, depending on the numerous and varying circumstances,
      and assumes most diverse forms according to the varying agronomic
      conditions, etc. The proletarisation of the peasantry continues, as we
      shall prove below by the mass of German statistics; besides which, it is
      evident from the cited data on the small peasantry. The increasing flight,
      not only of agricultural labourers, but of peasants, from the country to
      the towns is in itself striking evidence of this growing
      proletarisation. But the peasant’s flight to the town is necessarily
      preceded by his ruin; and the ruin is preceded by a desperate struggle for
      economic independence. The data on the extent of the employment of hired
      labour, the amount of “net income”, and the level of
      consumption of the various types of peasantry, bring out this struggle in
      striking relief. The principal weapon in this fight is “iron
      diligence” and frugality—frugality according to the motto
      “We work, not so much for our mouths as for our pockets”. The
      inevitable result of the

    

      struggle is the rise of a minority of wealthy, prosperous farmers (an
      insignificant minority in most cases—and in every case when
      particularly favourable conditions are absent, such as proximity to the
      capital, the construction of a railway, or the opening up of some new,
      remunerative branch of commercial agriculture, etc.) and the continuously
      increasing impoverishment of the majority, which steadily saps the
      strength of the peasants by chronic starvation and exhausting toil, and
      causes the quality of the land and cattle to deteriorate. The inevitable
      result of the struggle is the rise of a minority of capitalist
      farms based on wage-labour, and the increasing necessity for the majority
      to work at “side lines”, i.e., their conversion into
      industrial and agricultural wage-workers. The data on wage-labour very
      clearly reveal the immanent tendency, inevitable under the present system
      of society, for all small producers to become small capitalists.
    

      We quite understand why bourgeois economists, on the one hand, and
      opportunists of various shades, on the other, shun this aspect of the
      matter and why they cannot help doing so. The differentiation of the
      peasantry reveals to us the profoundest contradictions of
      capitalism in the very process of their inception and their
      further development. A complete evaluation of these contradictions
      inevitably leads to the recognition of the small peasantry’s blind-alley
      and hopeless position (hopeless, outside the revolutionary struggle of the
      proletariat against the entire capitalist system). It is not surprising
      that these most profound and most undeveloped contradictions are not
      mentioned; there is an attempt to evade the fact of the overwork and
      under-consumption of the small peasants, which can be denied only by
      unconscionable or ignorant people. The question of the hired labour
      employed by the peasant bourgeoisie and of wage-work of the rural poor is
      left in the shade. Thus, Mr. Bulgakov submitted an “essay on the
      theory of agrarian development”, passing over both these questions
      in eloquent

      silence![5]
    

      "Peasant farming,” he says, “may be defined as that form of
      farming in which the labour of the peasant’s own family is exclusively, or
      almost exclusively employed. Very rarely do even peasant farms dispense
      altogether with outside labour,— the help of neighbours or casual
      hired labour—but this does not change [naturally!] the economic
      features of peasant farming” (I, 141). Hertz is somewhat more naive,
      and at the very beginning of his book he makes the following reservation:
      “Hereinafter, by small or peasant farms I shall always assume a form
      of farming in which the farmer, the members of his family, and not more
      than one or.two workers are employed” (S. 6, Russian translation,
      p. 29). When they discuss the hiring of a “hand” our
      Kleinbürger soon forget the very “peculiarities”
      of agriculture which they constantly make so much of with no regard for
      relevance. In agriculture, one or two labourers is by no means a small
      number, even if they work only in the summer. But the main thing is not
      whether this is a small or a large number; the main thing is that hired
      labourers are employed by the

    

      wealthier, more prosperous peasants, whose “progress” and
      prosperity” our knights of philistinism are so fond of presenting as
      the prosperity of the mass of the population. And in order to put a better
      complexion on this distortion, these knights majestically declare:
      “The peasant is a working man no less than the proletarian”
      (Bulgakov, II, 288). And the author expresses satisfaction at the fact
      that “workers’ parties are more and more losing the anti-peasant
      tinge characteristic of them hitherto” (characteristic of them
      hitherto!) (289). “Hitherto”, you see, they “left out of
      account the fact that peasant property is not an instrument of
      exploitation, but a condition for the application of labour”. That
      is how history is written! Frankly, we cannot refrain from saying:

      Distort, gentlemen, but have a sense of measure! And the same Mr. Bulgakov
      has written a two-volume “study” of 800 pages chock-full of
      “quotations” (how correct they are we have repeatedly shown)
      from all sorts of inquiries, descriptions, monographs, etc. But not once,
      literally not once, has he attempted even to examine the
      relations between the peasants whose property is an instrument of
      exploitation and those peasants whose property is “simply” a
      condition for the application of labour. Not once has he
      presented systematic statistics (which, as we have shown, were contained
      in the sources he cited) concerning the types of farms, the standard of
      living, etc., of the peasants who hire labour, of the peas ants who
      neither hire labour nor hire themselves out as labourers, and of the
      peasants who hire themselves out as labourers. More than that. We have
      seen that to prove the “progress of peasant farming” (peasant
      farming in general!) he has given data on the Grossbauer
      and opinions that confirm the progress of some and the impoverishment and
      proletarisation of others. He even sees a general “social
      regeneration” (sic!) in the rise of “well-to-do
      peasant farms” (II, 138; for general conclusion, cf. p. 456), as if
      well-to-do peasant farm were not synonymous with bourgeois,
      entrepreneur-peasant farm. His one attempt to extricate himself from this
      tangle of contradictions is the following still more entangled argument:

      "The peasantry, of course, does not constitute a homogeneous mass; this has
      been shown above [probably in his argument about such a petty detail as the
      industrial wage-labour performed by farmers?]; a constant struggle is here in
      process

    

      between a differentiating trend and a levelling trend. But are these
      differences and even the antagonism of individual interests greater than
      those between the various strata of the working class, between urban and
      rural workers, between skilled and unskilled labour, between trade
      unionists and non-trade unionists? It is only by completely ignoring these
      differences within the worker estate (which cause certain investigators to
      see the existence of a fifth estate in addition to the fourth) that a
      distinction can be drawn between the allegedly homogeneous working class
      and the heterogeneous peasantry” (288). What a remarkably profound
      analysis! Confounding trade differences with class differences;
      confounding differences in the way of life with the different positions of
      the various classes in the system of social production—what better
      illustration is needed of the complete absence of scientific principles in
      the fashionable

      “criticism”[6]

      and of its practical tendency to
      obliterate the very concept “class” and to eliminate the very
      idea of the class struggle. The agricultural labourer earns fifty kopeks
      a day; the enterprising peasant who employs day-labourers earns a ruble a
      day; the factory worker in the capital earns two rubles a day; the small
      provincial master earns one and a half rubles a day. Any more or less
      politically conscious worker would be able to say without difficulty to
      which class the representatives of these various “strata”
      belong, and in what direction the social activities of these various
      “strata”

    

      will tend. But f or the representative of university science, or for the
      modern “Critic”, this is such a profound wisdom that it is
      totally beyond assimilation.

    
 

Notes
 

[1]

      Mr. Chernov “objects”: Does not the big farmer stint his
      day-labourer still more in food and other expenses? (Russkoye
      Bogatstvo, 1900, No. 8, p. 212). This objection repeats the old
      Krivenko-Vorontsov trick, if one may use such an expression, of
      foisting liberal-bourgeois arguments upon Marxists. The objection
      would be valid against those who say that large-scale production is
      superior, not only technically, but because it improves (or at least makes
      tolerable) the condition of the labourers. Marxists do not say that. They
      merely expose the false trick of painting the condition of the
      small farmer in roseate hues, either by sweeping statements about
      prosperity (Mr. Chernov on Hecht), or by estimates of “income”
      that leave out of account reduced consumption. The bourgeoisie
      must needs paint things in roseate hues, must needs foster the illusion
      among the labourers that they can become “masters” and that
      small “masters” can obtain high incomes. It is the business of
      socialists to expose these falsehoods and to explain to the small peasants
      that for them too there is no salvation outside of the revolutionary
      movement of the proletariat.
    —Lenin

      The authors of the Inquiry rightly say: The small peasant sells relatively
      little for cash, but he stands particularly in need of
      money, and because of his lack of capital, every cattle disease, every
      hailstorm, etc., hits him particularly hard.
    —Lenin

[4]

      “The peasantry,” writes Mr. Bulgakov, with reference to France in
      the nineteenth century, “split up into two sections, each sharply
      distinguished from the other, namely, the proletariat and the small
      proprietors” (II, 176). The author is mistaken, however, in
      believing that the “splitting up” ended with this—it is
      a ceaseless process.
    —Lenin

[5]

Or
      contains no less eloquent evasions, such as: "... the numerous cases
      of combining industry with agriculture, when industrial wage-workers own
      small plots of land...” are “no more than a detail [?!] in the
      economic system. There are as yet [?] no grounds for regarding this as a
      new manifestation of the industrialisation of agriculture,

   

or its loss of
      independent development; this phenomenon is much too insignificant in
      extent (in Germany, for instance, only 4.09 per cent of agricultural land
      is held by industrial wage-workers)” (sic!—II, pp. 254-55). In the
      first place, the fact that an insignificant share of the land is
      held by hundreds of thousands of workers does not prove that this
      “phenomenon is insignificant in extent”; it proves rather that
      capitalism degrades and proletarises the small farmer. Thus, the total
      number of farmers holding less than two hectares (although their number is
      enormous: 3,200,000 out of 5,500,000, or 58.2 per cent, almost
      three-fifths) own “only” 5.6 per cent of the total
      area of agricultural land. Will our clever Mr. Bulgakov draw the inference
      from this that the entire “phenomenon"of small landownership and
      small farming is a mere “detail” and “is much too
      insignificant in extent"?? Of the 5,500,000 farmers in Germany, 791,000,
      or 14.4 per cent, are industrial wage-workers; and the overwhelming
      majority of these own less than two hectares of land each, namely,
      743,000, which represents 22.9 per cent of the total number of farmers
      owning less than two hectares. Secondly, true to his usual practice,
      Mr. Bulgakov distorted the statistics he adduced. By an oversight
      he took from the page of the German Inquiry he quoted (Statistik des
      Deutschen Reichs, B. 112, S. 49 *) the figure of the area of land
      owned by independent trading farmers. The non-independent trading
      farmers (i.e., industrial wage-workers) hold only 1.84 per cent
      of the total area of agricultural land. 791,000 wage-workers own 1.84 per
      cent of the total area of land, while 25,000 landlords own 24 per
      cent. Truly a most insignificant “detail”!
    —Lenin

[6]

Let
      us recall the fact that reference to the alleged homogeneity of
      the working class was a favourite argument of Ed. Bernstein and of all his
      adherents. And as regards “differentiation”, it was Mr. Struve
      who, in his Critical Remarks, profoundly observed: There is
      differentiation, but there is also levelling; for the objective student
      both these processes are of equal importance (in the same way as it made
      no difference to Shchedrin’s objective historian whether Izyaslav defeated
      Yaroslav or

vice versa).[9]

      There is a development of the money economy,
      hut there are also reversions to natural economy. There is a development
      of large-scale factory production, but there is also a development of
      capitalist domestic industry (Bulgakov, II, 88:
      “Hausindustrie is nowhere near extinction in Germany”). An
      “objective” scientist must carefully gather facts and note
      things, “on the one hand” and “on the other”, and
      (like Goethe’s Wagner) “pass from book to book, from folio to
      folio”, without making the least attempt to obtain a consistent view
      and build up a general idea of the process as a whole.

General Statistics of German Agriculture for 1882
      and 1895.  The Question of the Medium Farms

      Having examined the detailed statistics of peasant farming, which are
      particularly important for us, because peasant farming is the centre of gravity
      of the modern agrarian question, let us now pass to the general statistics of
      German agriculture and verify the conclusions drawn from them by the
      “Critics”. Below, in brief, are the principal returns of the
      censuses of 1882 and of 1895:

      Three circumstances must be examined its connection with this picture of
      change interpreted differently by Marxists and by the
      “Critics”: the increase in the number of the smallest farms;
      the increase in latifundia, i.e., farms of one thousand hectares and over,
      in our table placed in the row of over one hundred hectares; and, lastly,
      the increase in the number of middle-peasant farms (5-20 hectares), which
      is the most striking fact, and the one giving rise to the most heated
      controversy.
    
 

      The increase in the number of the smallest farms indicates an enormous
      increase in poverty and proletarisation; for the overwhelming majority of
      the owners of less than two hectares cannot obtain a livelihood from
      agriculture alone but must seek auxiliary employment, i.e., work for
      wages. Of course, there are exceptions: the cultivation of special crops,
      viticulture, market gardening, industrial crop cultivation, suburban
      farming generally, etc., render possible the existence of independent (at
      times even not small) farmers even on one and a half hectares. But out of
      a total of three million farms, these exceptions are quite
      insignificant. The fact that the mass of these small “farmers”
      (representing three-fifths of the total number) are
      wage-labourers is strikingly proved by the German statistics
      concerning the principal occupations of the farmers in the various
      categories. The following is a brief summary of those statistics:

      We see, thus, that out of the total number of German farmers only 45%,
      i.e., fewer than half, are independent with farming as their
      main occupation. And even of these independent farmers
      one-fifth (20.1 %) have auxiliary occupations. The principal
      occupation of 17.5% of the farmers is trading, industry, market gardening,
      and so forth (in these occupations they are “independent”,
      i.e., occupy the position of masters and not of hired workers). Almost
      one-third (31.1%) are hired workers (“not independent”,
      employed in various branches of agriculture and industry). The principal

    

      occupation of 6.4% of the farmers is office employment (in military
      service, civil service, etc.), the liberal professions, etc. Of the
      farmers with farms under two hectares, one half are hired
      workers; the “independent” farmers among these 3,200,000
      “owners” represent a small minority, only 17.4% of the
      total. Of this number, 17%, one-fourth (26.1 %), are engaged in
      auxiliary occupations, i.e., are hired workers, not in their
      principal occupations (like the above-mentioned 50.3%),
      but in their side-line occupations. Even among the farmers owning
      from 2-5 hectares, only a little more than half (546,000 out of 1,016,000)
      are independent farmers without auxiliary occupations.
    

      We see from this how amazingly untrue is the picture presented by
      Mr. Bulgakov when, asserting (erroneously, as we have shown) that the
      total number of persons actually engaged in agriculture has grown, he
      explains this by the “increase in the number. of independent
      farms—as we already know, mainly middle-peasant farms, at the
      expense of the big farms” (II, 133). The fact that the number of
      middle-peasant farms has expanded most in proportion to the total number
      of farms (from 17.6% to 18%, i.e., a rise of 0.400) does not in the least
      prove that the increase in the agricultural population is due principally
      to the growth in the number of middle peasant farms. On the question as to
      which category has contributed most to the general increase in the number
      of farms, we have direct data that leave no room for two opinions: the
      total number of farms has risen by 282,000, of which the number of farms
      under two hectares increased by 174,000. Consequently, the larger
      agricultural population (if and insofar as it is larger at all) is to be
      explained precisely by the increase in the number of non-independent farms
      (the bulk of the farmers with farms under two hectares not being
      independent). The rise is greatest in the small allotment farms, which
      indicates growing proletarisation. Even the increase (by 35,000)
      in the number of farms of 2-5 hectares cannot be wholly attributed to the
      expanded number of independent farms, for of those farmers only
      546,000 out of the total of 1,016,000 are in dependent, drawing no
      subsidiary earnings.
    

      Coming now to the large farms, we must note, first of all, the following
      characteristic fact (of utmost importance for

    

      the refutation of all apologists): the combination of agriculture with
      other occupations has diverse and opposite significance for the various
      categories of farmers. Among the small farmers it signifies
      proletarisation and curtailed independence; for in this category
      agriculture is combined with occupations like those of hired labourers,
      small handicraftsmen, small traders, and so forth. Among the big farmers,
      it signifies either a rise in the political significance of landed
      proprietorship through the medium of government service, military service,
      etc., or the combination of agriculture with forestry and agricultural
      industries. As we know, the latter phenomenon is one of the most
      characteristic symptoms of capitalist advance in
      agriculture. That is why the percentage of farmers who regard
      “independent” farming as their principal occupation (who are
      engaged in farming as masters and not as labourers) sharply increases with
      the increase in the size of the farms (17-72-90-96%), but drops to 93% in
      the category of farms of 100 hectares and over. In this group 4.2% of the
      farmers regard office employment (under the heading of “other
      occupations”) as their principal occupation; 0.4% of the farmers regard
      “non-independent” work as their principal occupations (what is
      here discussed is not hired labourers but managers, inspectors, etc.,
      cf. Statistik des deutschen Reichs, B. 112, S.
      49 *). Similarly, we see that the percentage of independent farmers who
      engage in auxiliary occupations sharply diminishes with the increase in
      the size of the farms (26-25-15-9%), but greatly increases among the
      farmers possessing 100 hectares and over (23%).
    

      In regard to the number of large farms (100 hectares and over) and the area of
      land they occupy, the statistics given above indicate a diminution in
      their share in the total number of farms and the total area. The question
      arises:

      Does this imply that large-scale farming is being crowded out by small and
      middle-peasant farming, as Mr. Bulgakov hastens to assume? We think not;
      and by his angry thrusts at Kautsky on this point Mr. Bulgakov merely
      exposes his inability to refute Kautsky’s opinion on the subject. In the
      first place, the diminution in the proportion of the large farms is
      extremely small (from 0.47% to 0.45%, i.e., two-hundredths of one per cent
      of the total number of farms,

    

      and from 24.43% to 24.088%, i.e., 35-hundredths of one per cent of the
      total area). It is a generally known fact that with the intensification of
      farming it is sometimes necessary to make a slight
      reduction in the area of the farm, and that the big farmers lease small
      lots of land remote from the centre of the estate in order to secure
      labourers. We have shown above that the author of the detailed description
      of the large- and small-scale farms in East Prussia openly admits the
      auxiliary role played by small in relation to big landownership, and that
      he strongly advises the settlement of labourers. Secondly, there can be no
      talk of the elimination of large-scale by small-scale farming, for the
      reason that data on the size of farms are not yet adequate for
      judging the scale of production. The fact that in this respect
      large- scale farming has made considerable progress is irrefutably proved
      by statistics on the use of machinery (see above), and on agricultural
      industries (to be examined in greater detail below, since Mr. Bulgakov
      gives an astonishingly incorrect interpretation of the German statistics
      on this subject). Thirdly, in the group of farms of 100 hectares and over
      a prominent place is occupied by latifundia, i.e., farms of 1,000
      hectares and over. The number of these farms

      has increased proportionately more than the number of middle-peasant
      farms, namely, from 515 to 572, or by 11 %, whereas the number of
      middle-peasant farms has increased from 926,000 to 998,000, or by
      7.8%. The area of latifundia has increased from 708,000 hectares
      to 802,000 hectares, or by 94,000 hectares. In 1882 latifundia occupied
      2.22% of the total land under cultivation; by 1895 they occupied 2.46%. On
      this point Mr. Bulgakov, in his work, supplements the groundless
      objections to Kautsky he made in Nachalo with the following even
      more groundless generalisation: “An index of the decline of
      large-scale farming,” he writes, “is ... the increase of latifundia,
      although the progress of agriculture and the growth of intensive farming
      should be accompanied by the splitting-up of farms” (II,
      126). Mr. Bulgakov unconcernedly goes on to talk about the
      “latifundia [!]  degeneration” of large-scale farming (II,
      190, 363). With what remarkable logic our “scholar” reasons:

      since the diminution in the size of farms at times, with the
      intensification of farming, implies an increase in production,

    

      therefore an increase in the number and in the area of latifundia
      should, in general, signify a decline! But since logic is so bad,
      why not turn for help to statistics? The source from which Mr. Bulgakov
      draws his information contains a mass of data on latifundia farming. We
      present here some of the figures: in 1895, 572 of the largest agricultural
      enterprises occupied an area of 1,159,674 hectares, of which 802,000
      hectares were given over to agriculture and 298,000 were covered by
      forests (a part of these latifundia proprietors were primarily timber
      merchants and not farmers). Livestock of all kinds is kept by 97.9% of
      these farmers, and draught animals by 97.7%. Machines are used by 555 in
      this group,

      and, as we have seen, it is in this group that the
      maximum number of cases of the use of machines of various types
      occurs; steam ploughs are used by 81 farms, or 14% of the total number of
      latifundia farms; livestock is kept as follows: 148,678 head of cattle,
      55,591 horses, 703,813 sheep, and 53,543 pigs. Sixteen of these farms are
      combined with sugar refineries, 228 with distilleries, 6 with breweries,
      16 with starch factories, and 64 with flour-mills. Intensification may be
      judged from the fact that 211 of these farms cultivate sugar-beet (26,000
      hectares are devoted to this crop) and 302, potatoes for industrial
      purposes; 21 (with 1,822 cows, or 87 cows per farm) sell milk to the
      cities, and

      204 belong to dairy co-operative societies (18,273 cows, or 89 per
      farm). A very strange “latifundia degeneration” indeed!
    

      We now pass to the middle-peasant farms (5-20 hectares). The proportion
      they represent of the total number of farms has increased from 17.6% to
      18.0% (+0.4%), and of the total area, from 28.7% to 29.9% (+1.2%). Quite
      naturally, every “annihilator of Marxism” regards these
      figures as his trump card. Mr. Bulgakov draws from them the conclusion
      that “large-scale farming is being crowded out by small-scale
      farming”, that there is a “tendency towards
      decentralisation”, and so on and so forth. We have pointed out
      above that precisely with respect to the “peasantry”
      unclassified statistics are particularly unsuitable and can more than ever
      lead to error; it is precisely in this sphere that the processes of the
      formation of small enterprises and the progress” of the peasant
      bourgeoisie are most likely to

    

      conceal the proletarisation and impoverishment of the majority. In German
      agriculture as a whole we see an undoubted development of large-scale
      capitalist farming (the growth of latifundia, the increase in the use of
      machinery, and the development of agricultural industries), on the one
      hand; on the other, there is a still more undoubted growth of
      proletarisation and impoverishment (flight to the cities, expanded
      parcellisation of the land, growth in the number of small allotment
      holdings, increase in auxiliary hired labour, decline in the food
      consumption of the small peasants, etc.). Hence, it would be clearly
      improbable and impossible that these processes should not be current among
      the “peasantry”. Moreover, the detailed statistics definitely
      indicate these processes and confirm the opinion that data on the size of
      farms alone are totally inadequate in this case. Hence, Kautsky rightly
      pointed out, on the basis of the general state of the capitalist
      development of German agriculture, the incorrectness of drawing from those
      statistics the conclusion that small-scale production was gaining over
      large-scale production.
    

      We have, however, direct data abundantly proving that the increase in the number
      of “middle-peasant farms” indicates an increase in poverty
      and not in wealth and prosperity. We refer to the very data on draught animals
      which Mr. Bulgakov utilised so clumsily both in Nachalo and in his
      book. “If this required further proof,” wrote Mr. Bulgakov with reference
      to his assertion that medium farming was progressing and large-scale farming
      declining, “then to the indices of the amount of labour-power we could
      add the indices of the number of draught. animals. Here is an eloquent

      table.”[1]

      “The number of farms with draught animals declined among the large as
      well as the small farms, and increased only among the medium farms”
      (Nachalo, No. 1, p. 20).
    

      Mr. Bulgakov could be pardoned for having, in a hurriedly written magazine
      article, erred in arriving at a conclusion diametrically opposed
      to the one the statistics on draught animals logically lead to. But our
      “strict scientist” repeated this error in his
      “investigation” (Vol. II, p. 127, where, moreover, he used the
      figures +30,407 and —360 as applying to the number of animals,
      whereas they apply to the number of farms using draught animals. But that,
      of course, is a minor point).
    

      We ask our “strict scientist”, who talks so boldly of the
      “decline of large-scale farming” (II, 127): What is the
      significance of the increase of 30,000 in the number of middle-. peasant
      farms with draught animals when the total number of
      middle-peasant farms increased by 72,000 (II, 124)? Is it not clear from
      this that the percentage of middle-peasant farms with draught
      animals is declining? This being the case, should not
      Mr. Bulgakov have ascertained what percentage of farms in the
      various categories kept draught animals in 1882 and in 1895, the more so,
      since the data are given on the very page, and in the very table from
      which he took his absolute figures (Statistik des deutschen
      Reichs, B. 112, S. 31*)?
    

      The data are here given:

      Thus, the farms with draught animals diminished on the average by
      over 2 per cent; but the reduction was above the average among
      the small- and middle-peasant farms, and below the average among
      the large

      farms.[2]

      Moreover, it

    

      must not be forgotten that “it is precisely on the large farms that
      animal power is frequently displaced by mechanical power in the form of
      machines of various kinds, including steam-driven machines (steam ploughs,
      etc.)” (Statistik des deutschen Reichs, B. 112,
      S. 32*). Therefore, if in the group of large farms (of 100 hectares
      and over) the number with draught animals diminished by 360, and if at the
      same time the number with steam ploughs increased by 615 (710 in
      1882 and 1,325 in 1895), it is clear that, taken as a whole, large-scale
      farming has not lost, but has benefited thereby. Consequently, we come to
      the conclusion that the only group of German farmers who have undoubtedly
      improved their conditions of farming (with respect to the use of
      animals for field work, or the substitution of steam power for animals)
      are the big farmers, with farms of 100 hectares and over. In all
      the remaining groups the conditions of farming have deteriorated; and
      they have deteriorated most in the group of middle-peasant farms,
      in which the percentage of farms using draught animals has diminished
      most. The difference in the percentage of large farms (of 100
      hectares and over) and medium farms (of 5-20 hectares) with draught
      animals was formerly less than 3% (99.42 and 96.56); the difference is now
      more than 5% (97.70 and 92.62).
    

      This conclusion is still more strongly confirmed by the data on the types of
      draught animals used. The smaller the farm, the weaker the types: a relatively
      smaller number of oxen and horses and a larger number of cows, which
      are much weaker, are used for field work. The following data show the situation
      in this respect for the years 1882 and
      1895:
    

      For one hundred farms using draught animals the data are:

      We see a general deterioration in the kind of draught animals used (for
      the reason indicated, the small allotment farms are not taken into
      account), the greatest deterioration occurring in the group
      of middle-peasant farms. In that group, of the total number of farms
      possessing draught animals, the percentage of those compelled to use
      cows as well as other animals, and of those compelled to use
      cows only, increased most of all. At the present time,
      more than one-third of the middle-peasant farms with draught animals have
      to use cows for field work (which, of course, leads to poorer tilling and,
      consequently, to a drop in the crop yield, as well as to a lower milk
      yield), while more than one-fifth use only cows for field work.
    

      If we take the number of animals used for field work, we shall find in all
      groups (except the small allotment farms) an increase in the number of
      cows. The number of horses and oxen has changed as follows:

      With the exception of the small allotment farms, an increase in the
      number of draught animals proper is seen only among the big
      farmers.
    

      Consequently, the general conclusion to be drawn from the
      changes in farming conditions with regard to animal and mechanical power
      employed for field work, is as

    

      follows: improvement only among the big farmers; deterioration
      among the rest; the greatest deterioration among the
      middle-peasant farms.
    

      The statistics for 1895 enable us to divide the middle-peasant farm group
      into two subgroups: with 5 to 10 hectares and with 10 to 20 hectares
      respectively. As was to be expected, in the first subgroup (which has by
      far the greater number of farms), farming conditions insofar as they
      affect the use of draught animals are incomparably worse than in the
      second. Of the total of 606,000 owners of 5-10 hectares, 90.5% possess
      draught animals (of the 393,000 with 10-20 hectares— 95.8%), and of
      this number, 46.3% use cows for field work (17.9% in the 10-20 hectare
      group); the number using only cows amounts to 41.3% (4.2% in the 10-20
      hectare group). It turns out that precisely the 5-10 hectare group, the
      one most poorly equipped with draught animals, shows the greatest
      increase from 1882 to 1895 both in the number of farms and in
      area. The relevant figures follow:

      In the 10-20 hectare group the increase in the number of farms is quite
      insignificant. The proportion of the total area even diminished, while the
      proportion of the cultivated area increased to a much lesser extent than
      that of the farms in the 5-10 hectare group. Consequently, the increase in
      the middle-peasant farm group is accounted for mainly (and partly even
      exclusively) by the 5-10 hectare group, i.e., the very group in which
      farming conditions with regard to the use of draught animals are
      particularly bad.
    

      Thus, we see that the statistics irrefutably reveal the true significance
      of the notorious increase in the number of middle-peasant farms: it is not
      an increase in prosperity, but an increase in poverty; not-the
      progress of small farming, but its degradation. If the conditions
      of farming have deteriorated most among the middle-peasant farms,
      and if

    

      these farms have been obliged to resort most extensively to the use of
      cows for field work, then, on the basis of this aspect of farming alone
      (one of the most important aspects of farming as a whole), it is not only
      our right but our duty to draw the conclusions regarding all the other
      aspects of farming. If the number of horseless farms (to use a term
      familiar to the Russian reader, and one quite applicable to the present
      case) has increased, if there is deterioration in the type of draught
      animals used, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the general
      maintenance of the animals and the treatment of the soil, as well as the
      food and the living conditions of the farmers, have likewise deteriorated;
      for in peasant farming, as all know, the harder the animals are worked and
      the worse they are fed, the harder the peasant works and, the worse he is
      fed, and vice versa. The conclusions we drew above from Klawki’s detailed
      study are fully confirmed by the mass data on all the small peasant farms
      in Germany.
    
 

Notes
 

[1]

       We reproduce the table as given by Mr. Bulgakov, merely adding the
       totals.
    —Lenin

[2]

      The smallest reduction is observed among the smallest farms, only a
      relatively insignificant proportion of which keeps draught

   

animals. We
      shall see further that it was precisely among those farms (and
      only among them) that the composition of the draught animals
      improved, i.e., a larger number of horses and oxen and a relatively
      smaller number of cows were being kept. As the authors of the German
      Inquiry (S. 32*) have rightly remarked, the farmers on the smallest
      allotments keep draught animals, not only for tilling the land, but also
      for “auxiliary work for wages”. Consequently, in discussing
      the question of draught animals it would be erroneous to take these small
      allotments into account, since they are placed under altogether
      exceptional conditions.

      The Agricultural Population In Germany
      Divided According to its Position In the Economy

      We have dealt in such detail with the data on draught animals because
      these are the only data (apart from those dealing with machinery, which we
      have earlier examined) that enable us to obtain an inside view, as it
      were, of agriculture, of its equipment and organisation. All the other
      data—on the amount of land (which we have cited), and the number of
      livestock (to be cited below)—merely describe the external aspects
      of agriculture, equating things that are obviously unequal, since
      treatment of the soil and, consequently, its yield, and the quality and
      productivity of livestock are different in the different categories of
      farms. Although these differences are well known, they are usually
      forgotten in statistical compilations; the data on machines and draught
      animals alone enable us, at least to some extent, to form a judgement of
      these differences and to decide

    

      who gains (on the whole) from them. If the large farms use, to a larger
      extent than the rest, particularly complex and costly machines, which
      alone are taken into account by statistics, then it is obvious that the
      other types of agricultural implements, which statistics ignore (ploughs,
      harrows, waggons, etc.), are of a better quality, are used in larger
      numbers, and (because the farms are bigger) are more fully utilised on the
      large farms. The same applies to livestock. The small farmer must
      inevitably make up for the lack of these advantages by greater industry
      and frugality (he has no other weapons in his struggle for existence), and
      for this reason those qualities are not merely casual but always and
      inevitably distinguish the small farmer in capitalist society. The
      bourgeois economist (and the modern “Critic”, who on this
      question, as on all others, drags along at the tail of the bourgeois
      economist) calls this the virtue of thrift, perseverance, etc. (cf. Hecht
      and Bulgakov), ascribing it to the peasant as a merit. The socialist
      calls it overwork (Ueberarbeit) and under-consumption
      (Unterkonsumption) and holds capitalism responsible for it; he
      tries to open the eyes of the peasant to the deception practised by those
      who deliver Manilov orations, picturing social degradation as a virtue and
      thereby striving to perpetuate it.
    

      We shall now deal with the data on the distribution of livestock among the
      various groups of German farmers in 1882 and 1895. The following are the main
      summaries (in percentages of total):

      Thus, the share of the total livestock owned by the large farms has diminished,
      whereas that of the middle-peasant farms has increased most. We speak of the
      total livestock, notwithstanding the fact that the statistics refer only to
      value, because the statisticians’ assumption that the value of each animal is
      equal for all groups is obviously wrong.

    

      The data on value, which make it possible to add different kinds of
      livestock (the result could have been obtained by expressing all the
      livestock in terms of cattle; but this would have entailed fresh
      calculations, without however, altering the conclusions materially),
      actually show the distribution of all livestock according to number and
      not according to real value. Since the livestock belonging to the big
      farmers is of a better quality and probably improves to a greater extent
      than that of the small farmers (to judge by the improvement in the
      implements), the figures considerably minimise the real superiority of
      large-scale farming.
    

      With regard to certain types of livestock, it must be said that the
      diminution of the share of the large farms is entirely due to the decline
      in commercial sheep farming: from 1882 to 1895 the number of sheep
      diminished from 21,100,000 to 12,600,000, i.e., by 8,500,000; of this
      total diminution, farms of 20 hectares and over accounted for
      7,000,000. As is known, stock raising for the dairy-product and meat
      markets is one of the developing branches of commercial live stock farming
      in Germany. For this reason we took the data on cattle and pigs, finding
      that the greatest progress in these two branches of livestock
      farming has been made on the large farms (of 100 hectares and over): share
      in the total number of cattle and pigs has increased most. This fact
      stands out the more for the reason that the area of livestock farms is
      usually smaller than that of agricultural farms and one would thus expect
      a more rapid development, not of large, but of middle, capitalist
      farms. The general conclusion to be drawn (in regard to the number, not
      the quality, of cattle) should be the following: the big farmers have lost
      most as a result of the sharp decline in commercial sheep farming, and
      this loss has not entirely, but only partly, been compensated by a greater
      increase (as compared with the small and medium farms) in the raising of
      cattle and pigs.
    

      In speaking of dairy farming, we cannot ignore the extremely instructive
      and, as far as we know, unutilised material on this question furnished by
      German statistics. But this concerns the general question of combining
      agriculture with agricultural industries, and we are obliged to deal with
      it because of the amazing distortion of the facts of which Mr. Bulgakov is
      again guilty. As is known, the combination

    

      of agriculture with the industrial processing of farm produce is one of
      the most outstanding characteristics of the specifically capitalist
      progress in agriculture. Some time back, in Nachalo (No. 3,
      p. 32), Mr. Bulgakov declared:

      "In my opinion, Kautsky vastly exaggerates the significance of this
      combination. If we take the statistics, we shall find that the amount of land
      connected with industry in this way is quite negligible.” The argument is an
      extremely weak one; for Mr. Bulgakov does not dare to deny the technically
      progressive character of this combination. And as for the most important
      question, as to whether large-scale or small-scale production is the vehicle of
      this progress, he simply evades it. Since, however, the statistics provide a
      very definite reply to this question, Mr. Bulgakov resorts in his book
      to—sit venia

verbo![Save the
mark!—Ed.]–cunning.

      He cites the per centage of farms (of all farms in general and not
      according to groups!) that are combined with agricultural industry in one
      form or another, and remarks: “It must not be supposed that they are
      combined principally with large farms” (II, 116). The very opposite
      is the case, most worthy professor:

      that is precisely what must be supposed; and the table you give (which
      does not show the percentage of farms combined with agricultural
      industries in relation to the total number of farms in each
      group) merely deceives the uninformed or inattentive reader. Below we give
      the combined data (to avoid filling our pages with figures) on the number
      of farms connected with sugar refining, distilling, starch making,
      brewing, and flour milling (consequently, the totals will show the number
      of cases in which agriculture is combined with agricultural
      industries), and we get the following picture:

      Thus, the percentage of farms in combination with agricultural industries
      is negligible in small-scale farming and reaches marked dimensions only in
      large-scale farming (and enormous dimensions on the latifundia, of which
      more than half enjoy the benefits of this combination). If this
      fact is compared with the above-cited data on the use of machines and
      draught animals, the reader will understand the pretentious nonsense of
      Mr. Bulgakov’s aphorisms on the “illusion fostered by
      conservative” Marxists “that large-scale farming is the
      vehicle of economic progress and that small-scale farming is the vehicle
      of retrogression” (II, 260).
    

      “The great bulk (of sugar-beet and potatoes for distilling alcohol!)
      was produced on the small farms,” continues Mr. Bulgakov.
    

      But the very opposite is the case: it was precisely on the
large farms:

      Thus, we see again that the percentage of farms cultivating sugar-beet and
      potatoes for industrial purposes is negligible in the small-farm group,
      considerable in the large farm group, and very high on the
      latifundia. The great bulk of the beets (83.7 per cent, judging by the
      area under beet) is produced on the large
      farms.[1]
   

    
 

      Similarly, Mr. Bulgakov failed to ascertain the “share of
      large-scale farming” in dairy farming (II, 117); yet this branch of
      commercial livestock farming is one of those that are, developing with
      particular rapidity over the whole of Europe, as well as being one of the
      characteristics of the progress of agriculture. The following figures show
      the number of farms selling milk and dairy products to the towns:

      Thus, here too, large-scale farming is in advance: the percentage of
      farmers engaged in the milk trade increases proportionately with the
      increase in the size of the farms, and it is highest on the latifundia
      (“latifundia degeneration”). For instance, the percentage of large
      farms (100 hectares and over) selling milk to the towns is more than twice
      that of the middle-peasant (5-20 hectare) farms (3.4 and 1.5 per cent).
    

      The fact that the large farms (large in area) also engage in large-scale dairy
      farming is confirmed by the data on the number of cows per farm, viz., 36 per
      farm of 100 hectares

    

      and over, and even 87 on the latifundia. Generally speaking, the obviously
      capitalist farms (20 hectares and over) own 41.5% of the total number of
      cows, whose milk is sold to the towns, although these proprietors
      represent an insignificant percentage of the total number of farmers
      (5.52%), and a very small percentage of the number of farmers selling milk
      to the towns (15.6%). The progress of capitalist farming and the
      capitalist concentration of this branch of commercial livestock farming
      are therefore an indubitable fact.
    

      But the concentration of dairy farming is by no means fully brought out by
      data on farms grouped according to area. It is clear a priori
      that there can and must be farms equal in area but unequal in regard to
      livestock in general, and to dairy cattle in particular. Let us, first,
      compare the distribution of the total number of cattle among the
      various groups of farms with the distribution of the total number of cows
      whose milk is sold to the towns.

      Thus, we see again that it is the middle-peasant farms which are
      the worst off; this group utilises the smallest share of its
      cattle for the urban milk trade (the most profitable branch of dairy
      farming). On the other hand, the large farms occupy a very favourable
      position and utilise a relatively large proportion of their cattle for the
      urban milk

      trade.[3]

      But the position of the smallest farms is most
      favourable of all, for they utilise the largest proportion of
      their cattle for the urban milk trade. Consequently, in this

    

      group, special “milk” farms are developing on which
      agriculture is forced into the background, or even abandoned altogether
      (out of 8,998 farms in this group which sell milk to the towns, 471 have
      no arable land, and the farmers possess a total of 5,344 cows, or 11.3
      cows per farm). We obtain an interesting picture of the concentration of
      dairy farming within one and the same group according to area of tilled
      land if, with the aid of the German statistics, we single out the farms
      with one and with two cows each:

      Among the farms with a negligible amount of agricultural land (0-0.5
      hectares) we see an enormous concentration of dairy farming: fewer than
      one half of these farmers (850 out of 1,944) concentrate in their hands
      almost nine-tenths of the total number of cows in this group (9,789 out of
      11,255), with an average of 11.5 cows per farm. These are by no means
      “small” farmers; they are farmers having a turn over in all
      probability (especially those adjacent to big cities) of several thousand
      marks per annum, and it is doubtful whether they can manage without hired
      labour. The rapid growth of the towns causes a steady increase in the
      number of such “dairy farmers”, and, of course, there will
      always be the Hechts, Davids, Hertzes, and Chernovs to console the mass of
      the small peasants crushed by poverty with the example of isolated cases
      of their fellow-farmers who have “got on in the world” by
      means of dairy farming, tobacco cultivation, and so forth.
    

      In the 0.5-2 hectare group of farms we see that fewer than one-fifth of the
      total number of farmers (1,200 out of 7,054) concentrate in their hands over
      two-fifths of the total number of cows (5,367 out of 13,773); in the 2-5
      hectare

    

      group, fewer than one half of the farmers (4,690 out of 11,049)
      concentrate in their hands more than three-fifths of the total number of
      cows (19,419 out of 30,275), and so on. Unfortunately, the German
      statistics do not enable us to classify the groups with a larger number of

      cows.[4]

      But even the data presented fully confirm the general conclusion that
      the concentration of capitalist agriculture is in reality much
      greater than the data on area alone would lead us to suppose. The
      latter combine in one group farms small in area and producing small
      quantities of grain with farms producing dairy products, meat, grapes,
      tobacco, vegetables, etc., on a large scale. Of course, all these branches
      occupy a far inferior place as compared with the production of grain, and
      certain general conclusions hold good also in regard to
      statistics relating to area. But, in the first place, certain special
      branches of commercial agriculture are growing with

    

      particular rapidity in Europe, constituting a distinguishing feature of
      its capitalist evolution. Secondly, the circumstance referred to
      is frequently forgotten with reference to certain examples, or to certain
      districts, and this opens a wide field for petty-bourgeois apologetics,
      samples of which were presented by Hecht, David, Hertz, and Chernov. They
      referred to tobacco growers, who, judged by the size of their farms, are
      echte und rechte

Kleinbauern,[5]

      but, if judged by the extent of their tobacco plantations, are by no means
      “small” farmers. Moreover, if we examine the data on tobacco
      growing separately, we shall find capitalist concentration in this area
      also. For instance, the total number of tobacco growers in Germany in 1898
      was estimated at 139,000, with a cultivation of 17,600 hectares of tobacco
      land. But of these 139,000, some 88,000, or 63 per cent, together owned
      not more than 3,300 hectares, i.e., only one-fifth of the total area of
      land under tobacco. The other four-fifths were in the hands of 37% of the
      tobacco

      growers.[6]


      The same applies to grape growing. As a general rule, the area of the
      “average” vineyard, in Germany, for example, is very small:
      0.36 hectares (344,850 growers and 126,109 hectares of vineyards). But the
      vineyards are distributed as follows: 49% of the growers (with 20 or fewer
      ares of vineyards) have only 13% of the total area of vineyards;
      the “middle” growers (20-50 ares), representing 30%
      of the total, hold 26% of the total area of vineyards, whereas the big

    

      growers (half a hectare and over), representing 20% of the total, hold 61
      % of the total area of vineyards, or more than

      three-fifths.[7]

      Still more concentrated is market gardening (Kunst- und
      Handelsgärtnerei), which is rapidly developing in all capitalist
      countries in direct dependence on the growth of large cities, big railroad
      stations, industrial settlements, etc. The number of market gardening
      enterprises in Germany in 1895 is estimated at 32,540, with an area of
      23,570 hectares, or an average of less than one hectare each. But more
      than half of this area (51.39%) is concentrated in the hands of 1,932
      proprietors, or 5.94% of all the market gardeners. The size of the market
      gardens and the area of the rest of the land the big farmers utilise for
      agriculture can be judged from the following figures: 1,441 market
      gardeners have vegetable gardens ranging from two to five hectares, making
      an average of 2.76 hectares per vegetable farm, and total land amounting
      to an average of 109.6 hectares per farm; 491 farmers have vegetable
      gardens of five hectares and over, making an average of 16.54 hectares per
      farm, and total land amounting to an average of 134.7 hectares per farm.
    

      Let us return to dairy farming, the data on which help us to judge the
      significance of co-operative societies, which Hertz regards as a panacea
      for the evils of capitalism. Hertz is of the opinion that “the
      principal task of socialism” is to support these co-operative societies
      (op. cit., S. 21, Russian translation, p. 62; S. 89, Russian translation,
      p. 214), and Mr. Chernov, who, as might be expected, bruises his forehead
      in the act of ardent prostration before the new gods, has invented a
      theory of the “non-capitalist evolution of agriculture” with
      the aid of co-operative societies. We shall have a word or two to say on
      the theoretical significance of this sort of remarkable discovery. For the
      moment, we shall note that the worshippers of co-operative societies

    

      are always eager to talk of what it is “possible” to achieve
      by co-operative societies (cf. the instance given above). We, however,
      prefer to show what is actually achieved by the aid of co-operative
      societies under the present capitalist system. On the occasion of the
      census of enterprises and occupations in Germany in 1895 a register was
      made of all farms participating in co-operatives for the sale of dairy
      products (Molkereigenossenschaften und Sammelmolkereien), as well
      as of the number of cows from which each farmer obtained milk and milk
      products for sale. As far as we know, those are perhaps the only
      mass data that determine with precision, not only the extent to
      which farmers of various categories participate in co-operative societies,
      but, what is particularly important, the economic, so to speak, extent of
      this participation, viz., the size of the particular branch of each farm
      in the co-operative society (the number of cows providing products for
      sale organised by co-operative societies). We cite the figures, divided
      into the five principal groups according to area of farms:

      Thus, only an insignificant minority (3-5%) of the small farmers participate in
      co-operative societies—in all probability an even smaller percentage
      than that of capitalist farms in the lower groups. On the other hand, the
      percentage

    

      of the large, obviously capitalist, farms which participate in
      co-operative societies is from three to seven times greater than that of
      even the middle-peasant farms. The percentage of the latifundia
      participating in co-operatives is largest of all. We can now form an idea
      of the boundless naiveté of the Austrian Voroshilov, Hertz, who, in
      retorting to Kautsky, states that the “German Agricultural
      Co-operative Wholesale Society [Bezugsvereinigung], with which
      the largest co-operative societies are affiliated, represents
      1,050,000 farmers” (S. 112, Russian translation, p. 267,
      Hertz’ italics) from which he concludes that this means that not
      only big farmers (holding more than 20 hectares, who number 306,000)
      participate in these co-operatives, but peasants too! Hertz had only to
      ponder a little over his own assumption (that all the large farms
      participate in co-operatives), in order to realise that if all big farmers
      are members of co-operative societies, this implies that of the
      rest a smaller percentage participate in them, which means that
      Kautsky’s conclusion concerning the superiority of
      large-scale over small-scale farming even with respect to co-operative
      organisation is fully confirmed.
    

      But still more interesting are the data on the number of cows furnishing
      the products, the sale of which is organised by the co-operatives. The
      overwhelming majority of these cows, almost
      three-fourths (72%), belong to big farmers engaged in capitalist
      dairy farming and owning ten, forty, and (on the latifundia) even
      eighty cows per farm. And now let us listen to Hertz: “We assert
      that co-operative societies bring most benefit to the small and
      smallest farmers..." (op. cit., S. 112, Russian translation, p. 269,
      Hertz’ italics). The Voroshilovs are alike everywhere: be it in Russia or
      in Austria. When the Voroshilovs beat their breasts and exclaim
      vehemently, “We assert”, we can be quite sure that they are
      asserting that which is not.
    

      To conclude our review of German agrarian statistics, let us examine
      briefly the general situation in regard to the distribution of the
      agricultural population according to its position in the economy. Of
      course, we take agriculture proper (A 1, and not A 1 to 6,
      according to the German nomenclature, i.e., we do not include among the
      agriculturists fishermen, lumbermen, and hunters); we then take the

    

      data on persons for whom agriculture is the principal occupation.
      German statistics divide this population into three main groups: (a)
      independent (viz., farmer owners, tenant farmers, etc.), (b) non-manual
      employees (managers, fore men, supervisors, office clerks, etc.), and (c)
      labourers. The last-named group is split up into the following four
      subgroups:

      (c1) “members of families employed on a farm belonging to
      the head of the family —father, brother, etc.,” in other words,
      labourers that are members of the family, as distinct from hired
      labourers, to which category all the other subgroups of group c
      belong. Clearly, therefore, in order to study the social composition of
      the population (and its capitalist evolution), the labourers that are
      members of the family must not be grouped with the hired labourers, as is
      usually done, but with the farmers in group a; for they are in fact the
      farmers’ partners, enjoying right of inheritance, etc. Other subgroups
      are: (c2) agricultural labourers, men and women (Knechte
      und Mägde), and (c3) "agricultural day-labourers and
      other labourers (shepherds, herdsmen) owning or renting
      land”. Consequently, the last-named subgroup consists of persons who
      are at the same time farmers and wage-labourers, i.e., an intermediate and
      transitional group which should be placed in a special category. Finally,
      there is the subgroup (c4) “ditto—neither owning
      nor renting land”. In this way, we obtain three main groups:
      I. Farmers— owners of land and the members of their
      families. II. Farmers—owners of land and at the same time
      wage-labourers. III. Wage-workers not owning land (non-manual employees,
      labourers, and day-labourers). The following table illustrates the manner
      in which the rural

      population[9]

      of Germany

    

      was distributed among these groups in the years 1882
      and 1895:

      Thus, the active population has diminished, although only slightly. Among
      this population we see a diminution in the landowning section (1+ II) and
      an increase in the land less section (III). This clearly shows that
      the expropriation of the rural population is progressing, and
      that it is precisely the small landowners who are being expropriated; for
      we know by now that the wage-labourers with small plots of land belong to
      the group of smallest farmers. Furthermore, of the persons owning land,
      the number of farmer-labourers is diminishing, while the number of farmers
      is increasing. We see, therefore, the disappearance of middle groups
      and the growth of the extreme groups: the intermediary group is
      disappearing; capitalist contradictions are becoming more
      acute. Of the wage-labourers there is an increase in the number of
      those entirely expropriated, while the number owning land is
      diminishing. Of the farmers there is an increase in the number directly
      owning enterprises, while

    

      the number employed in the enterprises of heads of families is
      diminishing. (In all probability the latter circumstance is due to the
      fact that in the majority of cases working members of peasant families
      receive no pay whatever from the head of the family and for that reason
      are particularly prone to migrate to the cities.)
    

      If we take the data on the population for whom agriculture is an
      auxiliary occupation, we shall see that this (active or
      self-employed), population increased from 3,144,000 to 3,578,000, i.e., by
      434,000. This increase is almost entirely due to the growth in the number
      of working members of farmers’ families, which expanded by 397,000 (from
      664,000 to 1,061,000). The number of farmers increased by 40,000 (from
      2,120,000 to 2,160,000); the number of labourers owning land increased by
      51,000 (from 9,000 to 60,000); while the number of landless labourers
      diminished by 54,000 (from 351,000 to 297,000). This enormous increase
      from 664,000 to 1,061,000, or 59.8% in the course of 13 years, is further
      evidence of the growth of proletarisation—the growth of the number
      of peasants, members of peasants’ families, who have come to
      regard agriculture merely as an auxiliary occupation. We know
      that in those cases the principal occupation is working for wages (next in
      importance being petty trading, handicraft, etc.). If we combine the
      numbers of all working members of peasant families—those for whom
      agriculture is the principal occupation and those for whom it is merely an
      auxiliary occupation—we shall get the following:
      1882—2,559,000; 1895—2,960,000. This increase may easily
      provide occasion for erroneous interpretations and apologetic conclusions,
      especially if it is compared with the number of wage-labourers, which, on
      the whole, is diminishing. Actually, the general increase is obtained by
      the diminution in the number of working members of peasant
      families for whom agriculture is the principal occupation and by the
      increase in the number for whom it is an auxiliary occupation;
      the latter amounted in 1882 to only 21.7% of the total number of working
      members of peasant families, whereas in 1895 they amounted to 35.8%. Thus,
      the statistics covering the entire agricultural population
      distinctly reveal to us the two processes of proletarisation to which
      orthodox Marxism has always pointed, and

    

      which opportunist critics have always tried to obscure by stereotyped
      phrases. These processes are: on the one hand, the growing separation of
      the peasantry from the land, the expropriation of the rural population,
      which either moves to the towns or is turned from landowning labourers
      into landless labourers; on the other hand, the development of “auxiliary
      employment” among the peasantry, i.e., the combination of
      agriculture with industry, which marks the first stage of proletarisation
      and always leads to increased poverty (longer working day, malnutrition,
      etc.). Regarded only from the external aspect, these two processes, to a
      certain extent, even tend in opposite directions: an increase in the
      number of landless labourers and an increase in the number of working
      members of peasant landowning families. For this reason, to confound the
      two processes, or to ignore either of them, may easily lead to the crudest
      blunders, numerous examples of which are scattered through Bulgakov’s

      work.[11]

      Finally, the occupational statistics reveal to us a
      remarkable increase in the number of non-manual

      employees,[10]

      from 47,000 to 77,000, or 63.8%. Simultaneously with the growth of
      proletarisation, there is a growth of large-scale capitalist production,
      which requires non-manual employees to a degree rising in proportion to
      the increase in the use of machinery and the development of agricultural
      industries.
    

      Thus, notwithstanding his vaunted “details”, Mr. Bulgakov
      proved unable to grasp the German data. In the occupational statistics he
      merely saw an increase in the number of landless labourers and a
      diminution in the number of landowning labourers, which he took to be an
      index of the “changes that have taken place in the organisation of
      agricultural labour” (II, 106). But these changes in the
      organisation of labour in German agriculture as a whole have remained for
      him a fortuitous and inexplicable fact, in no way connected with the
      general structure and evolution of agricultural capitalism. In reality, it
      is only one of the aspects of the process of capitalist
      development. Mr. Bulgakov’s

    

      opinion notwithstanding, the technical progress of German agriculture is
      first and foremost the progress of large-scale production, as has been
      irrefutably proved by statistics relating to the use of machinery, the
      percentage of enterprises using draught animals and the type used, the
      development of industries connected with agriculture, the growth of dairy
      farming, and so forth. Inseverably connected with the progress of
      large-scale production are the growth of the proletarisation and
      expropriation of the rural population; the expanding number of small
      allotment farms and of peasants whose principal source of livelihood is
      auxiliary occupations; the increased poverty among the middle-peasant
      population, whose farming conditions have deteriorated most (the
      largest increase in the percentage of horseless farms and in the
      percentage of farms using cows for field work), and, consequently, whose
      general living conditions and quality of land cultivation have undergone
      greatest deterioration.
    

 
Notes
 

[1]

      Mr. Bulgakov’s sheer ... bad luck in his assertions on the processing of
      industrial crops is so strange that we involuntarily ask ourselves
      whether it may not be due to the fact that in citing the tables from the
      German Inquiry he jailed to see that they do not show the

   

percentage of farms combined with agricultural industries in relation
      to the total number of farms in the given group. On the one hand, it
      is difficult to imagine that a “study” by a strict scientist
      could contain such a string of errors (accompanied by a string of smug
      conclusions). On the other hand, the identity of Mr. Bulgakov’s tables
      with those in the German Inquiry (S. 40* and 41*) is beyond
      doubt.... Oh, those “strict scientists”!
    —Lenin

[2]

We
      have included this column so that the reader may form a clear idea of the
      methods employed by Mr. Bulgakov, who, for confirmation of his
      conclusions, refers only to this one column (taken from the above
      Inquiry).
    —Lenin

[3]

This
      difference is not to be explained by the fact that the proportion of oxen
      to the total number of cattle is unequal, for the percentage of oxen (at
      all events those used for field work) is higher on the large than on the
      middle-peasant farms.
    —Lenin

[4]

      To be more exact, the manner in which the German data are grouped
      does not enable us to do this; for the authors of the Inquiry had the data
      for each farm separately (on the basis of the replies listed in the
      questionnaires sent out to the farmers). In passing, we would state that
      this practice of gathering information from each farm separately adopted
      by German agricultural statistics is superior to the French method and
      apparently also to the English and other methods. Such a system enables us
      to classify the various types of farms, not only according to area, but
      also according to scale of farming (dairy farming, for example), according
      to the extent of use of machinery, degree of development of agricultural
      industries, and so forth. But this system requires a more thorough
      classification of the statistical data. First, the farms must be
      classified, not only according to one single feature (extent of area), but
      according to several features (number of machines, livestock, area of land
      under special crops, and so forth). Secondly, combined classifications
      must be made, i.e., the division of each group, classified according to
      area, into subgroups according to numbers of livestock, etc. Russian
      Zemstvo statistics on peasant farming can and should serve as a model in
      this respect. While German government statistics are superior to Russian
      government statistics in their fullness and comprehensiveness, in
      their uniformity and exactness, and in the rapidity of their preparation
      and publication, our Zemstvo statistics are superior to the
      European partial inquiries and investigations because of the remarkable
      fullness and detailed analysis of certain particular data. Russian Zemstvo
      statistics have for a long time included surveys of individual farms and
      presented various group tables and the combined tables we have
      mentioned. A close study of Russian Zemstvo statistics by Europeans would
      no doubt give a strong impetus to the progress of social statistics
      generally.

Die deutsche Votkswirtschaft am Schlusse des 19. Jrhd. (German
      National Economy at the End of the Nineteenth Century.—Ed.),
      Berlin, 1900, S. 60. This is a very rough computation based on the fiscal
      returns. For Russia, we have the following data on the distribution of
      tobacco growing in three uyezds of Poltava Gubernia: of the total of
      25,089 peasant farms growing tobacco, 3,015 farms (less than one-eighth)
      have 74,565 dessiatines under grain out of a total of 146,774 dessiatines,
      or more than one half, and 3,239 dessiatines under tobacco out of a total
      of 6,844 dessiatines, or nearly one half. By grouping these farms
      according to the tobacco area we get the following: 324 farms (out of
      25,089) have two or more dessiatines, comprising a total of 2.360 out of
      6,844 dessiatines. These belong to the big capitalist tobacco planters,
      notorious for their outrageous exploitation of the workers. Only 2,773
      farms (a little more than one-tenth) had over half a dessiatine each under
      tobacco, comprising altogether 4,145 out of 6,844 dessiatines nuder
      tobacco. See A Review of Tobacco Growing in Russia, Issues II and
      III, St Petersburg, 1894.
    —Lenin

[7]

It
      is of interest to note that in France, where vine growing is incomparably
      more developed than in Germany (1,800,500 hectares), the concentration of
      vineyards is also more considerable. However, we have only the general
      statistics on area to enable us to form a judgement; for in France data
      are not gathered on individual farms, and the actual number of growers is
      unknown. In Germany 12.83% of the total vineyards belong to growers
      owning ten or more hectares of land. In France, however, 57.02% of the
      vineyards belong to this category of growers.
    —Lenin

[8]

      Mr. Bulgakov stated: “The share of large-scale farming will be seen
      from the following figures” (II, 117), and he cited only
      these figures, which do not reveal “the share of large-scale
      farming” but (unless compared with other data) rather serve to
      obscure it.
    —Lenin

[9]

We
      speak only of the “active” population (as the French term it;
      in German, erwerbsthätige), i.e., those actually engaged in
      agriculture, not including domestic servants and those members of families
      who are not regularly and permanently engaged in agricultural
      work. Russian social statistics are so undeveloped that we still find
      lacking a special term like “active”,
      “erwerbsthätig”, “occupied”.  Yanson, in
      his analysis of the data on the occupations of the population of
      St. Petersburg (St. Petersburg According to the Census of 1890),
      employs the term “independent”; but this is not a suitable
      term, for it usually implies masters, and, consequently, division
      according to participation or non-participation in industrial activity (in
      the broad sense of the term) is confused with division according to the
      position occupied in industry (individual self-employed workman).

   

      The term “productive population” could be used, hut even that
      would be inexact, for the military, rentier, and similar classes are not
      at all “productive”. Perhaps the most suitable term would be
      “self-employed” population, viz., those engaged in some
      “trade” or other occupation (=producing an income), as
      distinct from those who live at the expense of those
      “self-employed”.
    —Lenin

[10]

In
      regard to this fact, Mr. Bulgakov delivered himself in Nachalo of
      the banal joke, “The increase in the number of officers in a
      dwindling army”. A vulgarised view of the organisation of labour in
      large-scale production!
    —Lenin
 



[11]

      It may be seen from the text of Chapters VII and IX, first published in
      the magazine Obrazovaniye, that Lenin intended to examine French
      agricultural statistics in this essay and to analyse the
      “critical” views of the French economist Maurice. This plan
      was not put into effect, and in the 1908 edition Lenin changed the
      passages showing his original design. Thus he omitted two words “and
      French” from the sentence: “The proletarisation of the
      peasantry continues, as we shall prove below by the mass of German and
      French statistics....” In the phrase: “The rapid growth of the towns
      causes a steady increase in the number of such ’dairy farmers’, and, of
      course, there will always he the Hechts, Davids, Hertzes, and Chernovs
      (and, not to offend France, the Maurices as well, whom we’ll mention
      later)...”, the words in parenthesis were omitted.

   

The end of the
      sentence, “For this reason, to confound the two processes, or to
      ignore either of them, may easily lead to the crudest blunders, an example
      of which we shall see later, when studying Bulgakov’s analysis of the
      French data”, was changed to: “numerous examples of which are
      scattered through Bulgakov’s book”.

Speech Delivered on September 21 (October 4)
(NOTE  THE MINUTES)

      Comrades!
 

      Let us begin with the point on which the success of the conference depends.
    

      As a representative of Iskra I consider it necessary to touch on the
      history of our attitude to the other organisations. Iskra has been
      completely independent from its very inception, recognising only ideological
      connections with Russian Social-Democracy and functioning on instructions from
      many comrades in Russia. In its first issue Iskra declared that it
      would not deal with the organisational differences that had arisen in the Union
      of Russian Social-Democrats

      Abroad[3]

      and attached the greatest importance to its position on matters of

      principle.[1]


      Some members of the Union Abroad proposed that we hold a conference to come to
      an agreement with the organisations abroad. We understood the proposal to mean
      that a group in the Union was in agreement with our principles, which made it
      possible that the Union would also accept them. The revolutionary organisation

      Sotsial-Demokrat,[4]

      voiced agreement, notwithstanding considerable organisational differences,
      as well as differences on principle. The Union, unfortunately, refused to
      negotiate. When a new group of

      initiators[5]

      appeared, the Union consented to the negotiations. Since the Union had no
      distinct physiognomy and since a new trend towards revolutionary Marxism
      had manifested itself within it it was to be hoped that an agreement

    

      on principle would be possible. Iskra and
      Sotsial-Demokrat again consented, and the Geneva Conference was
      held. At the beginning of our session Comrade Kruglov read the conference
      resolution without any comments. No one from the Union took the floor in
      opposition.
    

      We affirm that in its tenth issue, Rabocheye Dyelo made a
      decisive break with the traditions of revolutionary Marxism and opposed
      the agreement on principles elaborated at the Geneva Conference, with
      whose tendencies the Union is apparently in agreement.
    

      In view of this, my criticism will be directed against the editors of
      Rabocheye Dyelo, and not against the entire Union.
    

      Let us compare the Geneva resolution with the articles in issue No. 10 of
      Rabocheye Dyelo.
    

      The Geneva resolution astonishes one by its amazing detail and its stressing of
      points that are considered generally known.
    

      Point 1 of the agreement on principles reads: “Accepting the basic
      principles of scientific socialism and acting in solidarity with international
      revolutionary Social-Democracy, we reject all attempts to introduce opportunism
      into the class struggle of the proletariat—attempts that find expression
      in so-called Economism, Bernsteinism,

      Millerandism,[6]

      etc.” Here there is an obvious allusion to something; obviously a struggle
      was taking place between opportunism and revolutionary Marxism. Whatever
      the contents of issue No. 10 of Rabocheye Dyelo may be, it
      cannot, in any event, destroy the historical fact that the Geneva
      Conference took place and that the resolution it adopted can serve as a
      basis for unification. In its third point, for instance, the Geneva
      resolution recognises that Social-Democracy should assume leadership in
      the struggle for democracy. Apparently there were previous differences of
      opinion on this point, too. In its effort to keep well away from
      opportunism, the resolution descends almost to the ridiculous. (See Point
      “e” in Paragraph 5.)  It follows, therefore, that there were differences
      even on such elementary questions. Now let us compare that resolution with
      the articles in Rabocheye Dyelo (No. 10). Unfortunately I have
      had the articles at my disposal for three days only, not more than enough
      for a cursory examination.
    
 

      These articles give a detailed explanation of the difference in our views;
      there are some just remarks addressed to Zarya and Iskra
      which we shall turn to account. But that is not what concerns us at the
      moment; we are concerned with the principles underlying the articles. The
      position on principle adopted by Rabocheye Dyelo (No. 10)
      contradicts the position adopted by the Union delegates at the Geneva
      Conference. It is impossible to reconcile these two positions. It is
      necessary to reveal the differences contained in them in order to know on
      what basis the Union takes its stand, in order to know whether it is
      possible to effect ideological unity, without which organisational unity
      would be meaningless; we have not sought and could not seek such unity. On
      pages 32 and 33 of issue No. 10 of Rabocheye Dyelo the author of
      the article demurs at the contraposing of Mountain and Gironde in
      international

      Social-Democracy.[7]

      Look but at the Geneva Conference—does it not represent a clash
      between the Mountain and the Gironde? Does not Iskra represent
      the Mountain?  Did not Iskra in its very first editorial declare
      itself against organisational unity prior to the demarcation of
      ideological boundaries? In Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, it is stated
      that even the most rabid Bernsteinians take a stand on the basis of class
      interests. The resolution makes special mention of Bernsteinism, to refute
      which the delegates at the conference devoted considerable effort; and
      now, in the articles of Rabocheye Dyelo (No. 10), the same old
      fare is rehashed. What is this, a challenge or a sneer? To what end the
      effort we put forth? People are simply laughing at our pains to elaborate
      a theoretical basis. We must not forget that without a common ideological
      basis there can be no question of unity. In the same article, moreover, we
      get the prospect of a widened scope of our differences. On page 33, for
      example, the author writes:

      “Perhaps our differences arise out of different interpretations of
      Marxism?” Again, I ask, to what end the effort we put forth?
    

      Point “c” of Paragraph 4 of the Geneva resolution speaks of
      the necessity to struggle against all opponents of revolutionary Marxism;
      however, we are told that perhaps, in general, we understand Marxism
      differently.
    

      I must also mention that all this is accompanied by arguments on the
      harmfulness of fettering thought, etc., which

    

      is precisely what all the Bernsteinians are saying. This was stated at the
      Lübeck

      Parteitag,[8]

      and it is also repeated by the followers of

      Jaurès,[9]

      while the points of the agreement say nothing about this, since the
      agreement was made expressly on the basis of revolutionary Marxism. Even
      faint manifestations of criticism would have led to a complete breach. We
      have met to discuss the content of the opinions and not the freedom of
      opinion. References to French and German models are most unfortunate. The
      Germans have already achieved what we are still struggling for. They have
      a united Social-Democracy which exercises leadership in the political
      struggle. Our Social-Democracy is not yet the leader of the revolutionary
      groups; on the contrary, there are signs of the revival of other
      revolutionary tendencies. In the articles in Rabocheye Dyelo
      (No. 10), not only are there no signs of a complete break in principle
      with opportunism, there is even something worse—there is praise of
      the predominance of the spontaneous movement. I am not cavilling at
      words. All of us, the comrades from Iskra, the comrades from
      Sotsial-Demokrat, and I, are calling attention only to the basic
      tendencies of the articles; but those words, as the Germans say, ins
      Gesicht

schlagen.[Offend the
nostrils.—Ed.]

      Particularly as regards these points the Geneva resolution could not be
      clearer. The recently emerged Workers’ Party for the Political Liberation
      of

      Russia[10]

      chants in harmony with these publications.
    

      Consider in the article the famous distinction between tactics-as-plan and
      tactics-as-process. The author says that tactics-as-plan is in contradiction
      to the fundamental principle of revolutionary Marxism, and he thinks that one
      may speak of tactics-as-"process”, taken to mean the growth of the Party’s
      tasks, which increase as the Party grows. In my opinion this is simply
      unwillingness to discuss. We have expended so much time and effort on the
      formulation of definite political tasks, and at the Geneva Conference so much
      was said about them; and now we are suddenly being talked to about
      “tactics-as-plan” and “tactics-as-process”. To me this
      represents a return to the specific, narrow Bernsteinian product of
      Rabochaya Mysl which asserted that only that

    

      struggle should be conducted which is possible, and that the possible
      struggle is that which is going on. We on our part maintain that only the
      distortion of Marxism is growing. The Geneva resolution says that no
      stages are necessary for the transition to political agitation, and then
      an article suddenly appears in which “the literature of
      exposure” is contraposed to the “proletarian
      struggle”. Martynov writes about students and liberals, holding that
      they can worry about democratic demands themselves. We, however, think
      that the entire peculiarity of Russian Social-Democracy consists in the
      fact that the liberal democracy has not taken the initiative in the
      political struggle. If the liberals know better what they have to do and
      can do it themselves, there is nothing for us to do. The author of the
      article goes as far as to assume that the government will adopt concrete,
      administrative measures of its own accord.
    

      As we all know, there were differences of opinion on the question of
      terror at the Geneva Conference. After the Conference, a part of the Union
      Abroad, the

      Bund,[11]

      at its conference, came out decisively against terror. On page 23,
      however, the author writes that we “do not wish to set ourselves
      against the terrorist moods”. This is the sheerest

      opportunism.[The minutes break off at this
point.—Ed.]

2
Questions Submitted to the Union of Russian
      Social-Democrats Abroad at
      the “Unity” Conference, September 21 (October 4), 1901

      1. Do all the three organisations accept, in principle, the resolution
      of the June Conference?
    

      2. Is the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad willing and able so to
      organise publication activity as to render impossible unprincipled and
      opportunist deviations from revolutionary Marxism—deviations that
      create confusion of mind so dangerous for our movement—and to
      eliminate all flirting with tacit and avowed Bernsteinism, as well as
      servile acceptance of the elementary forms and spontaneity of the
      movement, which must inevitably lead to the conversion of the labour
      movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy?

The “Unity” Conference, held in Zurich on September
      21-22 (October 4-5), 1901, was an attempt to unite the Russian
      Social-Democratic organisations abroad on a platform of Marxist
      principles. The Conference was attended by representatives of the foreign
      department of the Iskra and Zarya organisation, the
      Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (which included the Emancipation of
      Labour group), the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, the Bund, and
      the Borba (Struggle) group.
    

      The Conference was preceded by a preliminary conference of representatives
      of these organisations in Geneva (June 1901). The Geneva Conference
      adopted a resolution containing fundamental principles for agreement and
      joint action.
    

      This apparent initial rapprochement was to have been officially
      constituted at the “Unity” Conference; but articles by the
      leaders of the Union Abroad, published in Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10
      (September 1901), as well as amendments and addenda to the resolution of
      the Geneva Conference, submitted by the Union Abroad during the
      “Unity” Conference, showed that the Union Abroad still adhered
      to its opportunist position. The representatives of Iskra and
      Sotsial-Demokrat read a declaration and withdrew from the
      Conference.
    

      Lenin took part in the “Unity” Conference under the name of
      Frey and spoke under that name. This was his first public appearance among
      the Russian Social-Democrats abroad.
    



[3]

The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in
      Geneva in 1894, on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group,
      which at first supervised its activities and edited its
      publications. Opportunist elements (the “young”
      Social-Democrats, the “Economists”) later gained the upper hand in
      the Union. At the Union’s first conference, in November 1898, the
      Emancipation of Labour group refused to bear further responsibility for
      the editorship of its publications. The final break with the Union and
      the withdrawal of the Emancipation of Labour group took place in April
      1900, at the Union’s second conference, when the Emancipation of Labour
      group and its supporters left the Conference and founded the autonomous
      organisation Sotsial-Demokrat.
    



[4]

The
      Sotsial-Demokrat organisation was founded by the Emancipation of
      Labour group and its supporters after the split in the Union of Russian
      Social-Democrats Abroad (May 1900). In a leaflet-manifesto the
      organisation declared its purposes to be “the promotion of the
      socialist movement among the Russian proletariat” and the struggle
      against every opportunist attempt to distort Marxism.

   

The
      organisation published a Russian translation of The Manifesto of the
      Communist Party, a number of works by Marx and Engels, and several
      pamphlets by Plekhanov, Kautsky, and others. In October 1901, on Lenin’s
      initiative, the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation joined forces with
      the Iskra-Zarya organisation abroad and formed the League of
      Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.
    



[5]

      This group, consisting of D. B. Ryazanov, Y. M. Steklov (Nevzorov),
      E. L. Gurevich (V. Danevich, Y. Smirnov), which was formed in Paris in
      1900, adopted, in May 1901, the name of “Borba” (Struggle). In
      an attempt to reconcile the revolutionary and opportunist trends in
      Russian Social-Democracy, the Borba group proposed the unification of the
      Social-Democratic organisations abroad and for this purpose entered into
      negotiations with the Iskra-Zarya and Sotsial-Demokrat
      organisations and with the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad; the
      group also took part in the Geneva Conference (June 1901) and in the
      “Unity” Conference (October 1901). In the autumn of 1901 the
      Borba group took shape as an independent literary group and announced its
      publications. In these publications (“Material for a Party
      Programme”, Issues I-III; “Leaflet” No. 1, 1902, etc.)
      the group distorted the revolutionary theory of Marxism and displayed
      hostility to the Leninist principles of organisation and the tactical line
      of Russian revolutionary Social-Democracy. On account of its deviation
      from Social-Democratic views and tactics, its disorganising activities,
      and its lack of contact with Social-Democratic organisations in Russia,
      the Borba group was not allowed to participate in the Second Congress of
      the R.S.D.L.P. By decision of the Second Congress, the Borba group was
      dissolved.
    



[6]

Millerandism—an opportunist trend called after the French
      social-reformist Millerand, who, in 1899, entered the reactionary
      bourgeois government of General Galiffet, the butcher of the Paris
      Commune.
    



[7]

Mountain and Gironde—the two political groups of the
      bourgeoisie during the French bourgeois revolution at the end of the
      eighteenth century. La Montagne (Mountain) was the name given to
      the Jacobins, the most consistent representatives of the revolutionary
      class of the period—bourgeoisie; they advocated the abolition of
      absolutism and the feudal system. The Girondists, as distinct from them,
      vacillated between revolution and counter-revolution, and chose the way of
      compromise with the royalists.
    

      Lenin applied the term “Socialist Gironde” to the opportunist
      tendency in Social-Democracy and the term “Mountain” or
      proletarian Jacobins, to the revolutionary Social-Democrats. After the
      R.S.D.L.P. had split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin, on many
      occasions, stressed the point that the Mensheviks were the Girondist
      tendency in the working-class movement.
    



[8]

The Lübeck Parteitag of the German Social-Democratic Party
      was held between September 9 and 15 (22-28), 1901. The central is sue at
      the Congress was the struggle against revisionism, which bad by that time
      taken form as the Right Wing of the Party, with its own programme and
      periodical press (Sozialistische Monatshefte). Bernstein, the
      leader of the revisionists, had long been advocating the revision of
      scientific socialism; at the Congress he demanded “freedom to
      criticise” Marxism. The Congress rejected the resolution introduced
      by Bernstein’s supporters and adopted a resolution that gave a direct
      warning to Bernstein, though without laying down the principle that
      Bernsteinian views were incompatible with membership of the working-class
      party.
    



[9]

Jaurèsists—followers of the French socialist
      J. J. Jaurès, who headed the Right reformist Wing of the French
      Socialist Party. Under the pretext of defending “freedom of
      criticism”, they sought to revise the Marxist principles and
      preached the class collaboration of the proletariat and the
      bourgeoisie. In 1902 they formed the French Socialist Party, which adhered
      to reformist principles.
    



[10]

The Workers’ Party for the Political Liberation of Russia—a
      small Narodnik-type organisation; existed in Minsk, Belostok and several
      other cities from 1899 to 1902. In 1902 the members of the party joined
      the Socialist Revolutionary Party.
    



[11]

The Bund—the General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania,
      Poland, and Russia; founded in 1897, it embraced mainly the Jewish
      artisans in the western regions of Russia. The Bund joined the
      R.S.D.L.P. at its First Congress in March 1898. At the Second Congress of
      the R.S.D.L.P. Bund delegates insisted on the recognition of their
      organisation as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat in
      Russia. The Congress rejected this organisational nationalism, whereupon
      the Bund withdrew from the Party.
    

      In 1906, following the Fourth (“Unity”) Congress, the Bund
      reaffiliated with the R.S.D.L.P. The Bundists constantly supported the
      Mensheviks and waged an incessant struggle against the Bolsheviks. Despite
      its formal affiliation with the R.S.D.L.P., the Bund remained an
      organisation of a bourgeois-nationalist character. As opposed to the
      Bolshevik programmatic demand for the right of nations to
      self-determination, the Bund put forward the demand for cultural-national
      autonomy. During the First World War of 1914-18 the Bund took the stand of
      social-chauvinism. In 1917 the Bund supported the counter-revolutionary
      Provisional Government and fought on the side of the enemies of the
      October Socialist Revolution. During the Civil War, prominent Bundists
      joined forces with the counter-revolution. At the same time, a turn began
      among the rank and file in favour of support to the Soviet
      Government. When the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat over
      the internal counter-revolution and foreign intervention became apparent,
      the Bund declared its abandonment of the struggle

   

against the Soviet
      system. In March 1921, the Bund dissolved itself and part of the
      membership joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) as new members.

      What astonishing solicitude for the famine-stricken our government is
      displaying! What an amazingly long circular (of August 17) the Minister of
      the Interior has issued to the governors of the affected gubernias! A
      veritable literary work, more than sixteen pages long, written by
      Mr. Sipyagin to explain the government’s food policy in its entirety. The
      document was apparently published to impress the “public”, as
      if to say: See how solicitous we are, how prompt we are with relief
      measures, how providential we are in organising in advance food-kitchens
      and all forms and phases of their activity! It must be admitted that the
      circular issued by the Ministry of the Interior certainly does create an
      impression, both by its bulk and (if one has the patience to read it
      through) by its contents. A frank exposition of the government’s policy is
      always the best means for agitation against the tsarist government and,
      while expressing our profound gratitude to Mr. Sipyagin, we make bold to
      suggest that the other ministers speak more frequently of their programme
      in circulars published for general information.
    

      If one has the patience to read through Mr. Sipyagin’s circular to the
      end, we said. A great deal of patience will be required, for
      three-fourths, nay, nine-tenths of the circular consists of the usual
      official banalities. It is a rehash of things known for years and repeated
      a hundred times even in the “Code of

      Laws”.[1]

      It is a mass of circumlocution, a detailed description of the ceremonial
      in the relations between Chinese mandarins; it is in the grand style of
      the chancelleries, with periods thirty-six lines long, in a
      “jargon” that makes the heart bleed for our native Russian

    

      language. As you read deeply into this effusion, you feel as though you
      were in a Russian police-station with its musty walls and its
      all-pervading specific stench, in which the officials personify in their
      appearance and bearing the most case-hardened bureaucracy, while in the
      courtyard, visible through the window, gloomy buildings loom reminiscent
      of the torture chamber.
    

      Three main points in the government’s new programme attract particular
      attention: first, greater power is vested in the individual officials and
      care is taken that the bureaucratic spirit and service discipline should
      be strengthened and protected from any breath of fresh air; secondly, a
      scale of relief is fixed for the famine-stricken, viz., regulations on the
      rationing of bread to be given to a “needy” family; and,
      thirdly, despairing horror is expressed at the fact that
      “disloyal” persons, capable of arousing the people against the
      government, are rushing in to help the famine-stricken, and timely
      measures against such “agitation” are provided for. We shall
      deal with each of these points in detail.
    

      Only a year has elapsed since the government deprived the Zemstvos of the
      right to manage food affairs and transferred that administration to the
      rural superintendents and uyezd congresses (law of June 12, 1900). Now
      before the law has come into force, it has been repealed by a mere
      circular. The reports of a number of provincial governors sufficed to
      convince the government that the law had become unsuitable! This makes
      plainly evident the worthlessness of laws that are turned out like
      pancakes by the St. Petersburg government departments without prior
      discussion on a serious level by people really informed and capable of
      expressing an independent opinion, and without serious intention to create
      a more satisfactory state of affairs, laws that are dictated by the
      ambition of some cunning minister eager to further his career and display
      his loyalty. The Zemstvo is not loyal—take the food administration
      out of its hands! But before this could be done it was discovered that the
      rural superintendents and even the uyezd congresses, consisting
      exclusively of government officials, were inclined to discuss matters too
      much. Apparently there were rural superintendents stupid enough to call
      famine famine and simple enough to think it necessary

    

      to fight against the famine, and not against those who really want to help
      the famine-stricken; and in all probability there were officials in the
      uyezd congresses who were not subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior
      and who also failed to understand the real tasks of “home
      politics”. And so, by the mere circular of a minister a new
      “Central Uyezd”—no, this is not a printer’s
      error—a “Central Uyezd Food Board” is set up, the whole
      purpose of which is to prevent the infiltration of disloyal persons and
      disloyal ideas and the commission of imprudent acts in the administration
      of food distribution. Thus, the Minister considers as imprudent and
      prohibits the “premature” compilation (i.e., not immediately
      before the bread distribution) of lists of the needy. It arouses, he says,
      “exaggerated hopes” among the people! The Central Uyezd Food
      Board is concentrated in the hands of a single person, and the
      Ministry recommends the uyezd marshal of the nobility for the
      post. Indeed, that official is so closely connected with the governor and
      performs so many police functions that he will doubtless be able to
      understand the true spirit of the food policy. More over, he is a big
      local landed proprietor, respected and trusted by all the landlords. A man
      of that type will certainly understand, as no one else will, the
      Minister’s profound idea on the “demoralising” effects of
      relief given to persons “able to dispense with it”. As for the
      gubernatorial powers, the Minister refers to this subject at the very
      beginning of the circular and repeats over and over again that the
      governor is responsible for everything, that all must obey the governor,
      that the governor must be able to take “special” measures,
      etc. To this day the governor in a Russian province has always been a real
      satrap upon whose pleasure the existence of any and every institution, and
      even of every individual, in the province “in his charge”
      depends; but now a real “state of war” has been
      established. Severity increased to an inordinate degree—in
      connection with famine relief! This is so truly Russian!
    

      But greater stringency, intensified surveillance—all this demands
      increased expenditure on the bureaucratic machine, a fact of which the
      Minister has not lost sight; the uyezd marshals of the nobility, or other
      persons directing the Central Uyezd Food Board, will be granted “a
      special sum to cover their expenses,” “concerning the approximate amount
      whereof Your Excellency will tender the appropriate application to
      me”, adds the circular in its “special” jargon. In
      addition, further sums will be granted as follows: 1,000 rubles in a lump
      sum for uyezd council “office expenses”; from 1,000 to 1,500
      rubles for expenses of the gubernia governor s offices. It is the offices
      that will have to carry on most of the activity, since famine relief will
      consist almost entirely of office work—how can the offices be left
      without the necessary funds? The offices come first, and what is left can
      go to the famine-stricken.
    

      Mr. Sipyagin displays remarkable persistence and resourcefulness in
      devising measures for reducing famine relief. In the first place,
      he calls upon all governors to discuss which uyezds “have been
      affected by the harvest failure” (the final determination on this
      matter rests with the Ministry itself, since even governors cannot be
      trusted to avoid “exaggeration”!). Then follow the instructions
      indicating when uyezds are not to be regarded as affected areas:
      (1) if not more than one-third of its

      volosts [See footnote to p.
  36.—Tr]

      are affected; (2) if a grain shortage is usual in the uyezd and additional
      grain is purchased annually with subsidiary earnings; (3) if local
      resources are insufficient to grant relief. Here we have an example in
      miniature of the bureaucratic solution of the food problem— one
      measuring rod for all! What is the size of the population of one-third of
      the volosts? how seriously are they affected? have not the usual
      “earnings” been reduced this year by the serious industrial
      crisis?— all these are idle questions after the categorical
      “directions” of the Ministry. But the worst is still to
      come. The point at issue is—who is to be regarded as needy and how
      much relief is to be granted? Mr. Sipyagin recommends the following
      “approximate” computation which “has rarely been found
      to be greatly exaggerated”. (What we fear most of all is
      exaggeration; we fear exaggerated hopes, we fear exaggerated loans!
      Famine, unemployment—all these are merely
      “exaggerations”. Such is the idea that clearly emerges from
      all the ministerial reasoning.) In the first place, a test threshing is to
      be made to determine the “average yield per dessiatine in
      each village”,

    

      after which the area sown by each farmer is to be estimated. Why not also
      determine the size of the crop harvested by farmers of different means?
      The harvest of a poor peasant is smaller, and the term
      “average” is disadvantageous precisely to those in
      distress. Secondly, those who gather not less than forty-eight poods of
      grain per family per annum (counting twelve poods for three adults and six
      poods for two children) are not regarded as being in distress. This is the
      sort of calculation a tight-fisted kulak could be expected to make. In an
      ordinary year even the poorest peasant family of five or six persons
      consumes eighty, not forty-eight, poods of grain, whereas the middle
      (average) peasant family of five consumes 110 poods, as is known from
      surveys of peasant farming. Consequently, the tsarist government is
      cutting down by one half the amount of grain actually needed for
      food. Thirdly, says the circular, “this quantity [viz., forty-eight
      poods per family] is to be reduced by one half, in view of the fact that
      the worker element represents about fifty per cent of the
      population”. The government stubbornly insists upon its standing
      rule that the working population must not be given relief because, as it
      argues, they can earn money. But the Minister has already ordered that the
      uyezds in which the population is normally engaged in auxiliary
      occupations shall not come under the heading of affected areas. Why, then,
      should he deprive the working population of relief for a second
      time? Everyone knows that, not only are there no opportunities for
      earning extra money this year, but that even the usual subsidiary earnings
      have declined owing to the crisis. The government itself has banished many
      thousands of unemployed workers from the cities to the rural areas. The
      experience of previous famines has shown that exclusion of the adult
      working population from relief leads only to the division of the existing
      inadequate relief between children and adults. No, the saying that
      “you can not skin one ox twice” would be far too flattering
      for a Ministry of the Interior that in a twofold way excludes from the
      relief lists all who are able to work. Fourthly, this relief, totally
      inadequate and reduced by one half, is still further cut down by
      one-third, one-fifth, or one-tenth, “in proportion to the
      approximate number of well-to-do farmers having stocks left over from last
      year, or any other material

    

      resources”! This is the third hide flayed from the same ox. What kind of
      “stock” can a peasant have if he has harvested not more than
      forty-eight poods of grain for his whole family? All other earnings have
      been taken into account twice; moreover, even the Russian peasant, with
      all the poverty to which government policy and exploitation by capitalists
      and landlords have reduced him, cannot live by bread alone. In addition to
      bread, he must spend money on fuel, clothes, and other food, as well as on
      repairs to his house. In ordinary years, as scientific inquiries into peasant farming inform us, even the poorest peasant spends more than
      half his income on requirements other than bread. If all these things
      are taken into account, it will be found that the Minister calculates the
      relief to be granted at one- fourth or one-fifth of what is
      actually needed. This is not fighting famine, it is fighting those who
      really want to help the famine-stricken.
    

      The circular concludes with a regular crusade against private
      philanthropists. It has not infrequently been revealed, thunders
      Mr. Sipyagin, that certain philanthropists strive to arouse among the
      population “discontent with the present system and encourage the
      people to make totally unjustified demands on the government”, that
      they conduct “anti-government agitation”, etc. These
      accusations are absolutely false. It is well known that in 1891
      leaflets were distributed by “peasant

      well-wishers”[2]

      in which the people were rightly told who their real enemy was; probably
      other attempts at agitation were made in connection with the famine. But
      there was not a single case of revolutionaries carrying on propaganda
      under cover of philanthropy. The vast majority of the
      philanthropists—this is an undoubted fact—were just
      philanthropists and nothing more. When, therefore, Mr. Sipyagin
      states that many of them were “persons whose political past is not
      irreproachable”, we ask him, who among us now has an
      “irreproachable past”? Even “highly-placed persons”
      often paid tribute to the general democratic movement in their youth. Of
      course, we do not wish to say that to carry on agitation against the
      government in connection with the famine is impermissible or even
      undesirable. On the contrary, such agitation is always necessary,
      particularly in times of famine. We

    

      merely wish to point out that Mr. Sipyagin is straying into the realm
of fiction in trying to make it appear that his fears and anxieties
are based on past experience. We wish to say that Mr. Sipyagin’s
statement is further proof of an old truism: the police government is
afraid of even the slightest contact between the people and
intellectuals that are in the least independent and honest, it fears
every true and bold utterance addressed directly to the people, it
suspects— and rightly so—that mere solicitude for the
genuine (not imaginary) satisfaction of the people’s needs is tantamount
to agitation against the government; for the people see that private
philanthropists sincerely desire to help them, while the tsarist
government officials hamper and reduce relief, minimise the extent of
the distress, impede the opening of food-kitchens, etc. Now the new
circular demands that all contributions and appeals for contributions,
as well as the opening of food-kitchens, “be under the control of
the authorities”; it demands that all relief workers arriving in
the affected areas “present themselves” to the governor,
that they may choose assistants only with his consent, and that they
submit to him a report of their activities! Those who desire to help the
famine-stricken must submit to police officials and to the police system
of curtailing relief and shamefully reducing relief rates. Whoever
refuses to submit to this despicable procedure must not be allowed to
carry on relief work—such is the essence of government
policy. Mr. Sipyagin howls that “politically unreliable persons
are eagerly taking advantage of the famine to pursue their criminal aims
on the pretence of helping their neighbours”, and this cry is
taken up by the entire reactionary press (e.g., Moskovskiye
Vedomosti). How horrible! To exploit the sufferings of the people
for political purposes! In point of fact, what is horrible is precisely
the fact that in Russia every kind of activity, even
philanthropic work most remote from politics, inevitably brings people
capable of independent thought into conflict with police tyranny and
with measures of “suppression”, “prohibition”,
“restriction”, etc., etc. It is horrible that the
government, under the cloak of high political considerations, pursues
its Judas

      policy[3]

      of taking bread from the starving, cutting down relief to one-fifth,
      prohibiting everyone except police officials

    

      from approaching the starving! We repeat the call issued in
      Iskra: Organise a campaign of exposure against the police
      government’s food policy; expose in the uncensored free press the outrages
      committed by local satraps, the whole avaricious tactic of curtailing
      relief, the miserliness and inadequacy of the relief, the despicable
      attempt to minimise the extent of the famine, and the shameful struggle
      against those who desire to help the famine-stricken! We advise all who
      have a grain of sincere sympathy for the people in their dire distress to
      take measures to bring to their knowledge the true sense and significance
      of the ministerial circular. It is only because of the unbounded ignorance
      of the people that such circulars do not immediately call forth
      an outburst of general indignation. Let the class-conscious workers who
      stand closest to the peasantry and to the less enlightened urban masses
      take the initiative in this work of exposing the government!

Rabochaya Mysl, the organ of the St. Petersburg Committee (League of

      Struggle[1]),

      in its issue No. 12, published an article replying to a note in the first
      issue of Iskra on the split in the Union of Russian
      Social-Democrats Abroad. Unfortunately, the reply assiduously
      evades the very essence of the controversy; such methods of
      discussion will never make the case clear. We have maintained and continue
      to maintain that a split has taken place in the Union of Russian
      Social-Democrats Abroad, that the Union broke up into two
      sections after the withdrawal from the conference in 1900 of a substantial
      minority, including the Emancipation of Labour

      group,[2]

      which had established the Union and formerly edited all its
      publications. Now that the split has occurred, neither of the two sections
      can occupy the place formerly occupied by the old Union as a whole. The
      St. Petersburg Committee does not attempt to refute this opinion
      when (for some unknown reason) it speaks only of Plekhanov and not of the
      Sotsial-Demokrat organisation and when it lets its readers know
      only indirectly that the St. Petersburg League of Struggle apparently
      denies the fact of the split and continues to regard one of the
      sections of the late Union Abroad as the whole Union.
    

      To what end engage in a polemic if there is no desire to examine the
      essence of the opponent’s opinion and frankly to express one’s own?
    

      To continue. We have maintained and hold to our view that the principal
      cause (not pretext, but cause) of the split was a difference of opinion on
      principles, namely, a difference between revolutionary and opportunist
      Social Democracy. For this reason alone, what has happened in

    

      the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad cannot be regarded as
      anything but a split in the old Union Abroad. The question
      arises—how does the St. Petersburg Committee regard the matter? Will
      it dare to deny the existence of profound differences in principle
      between the two sections of the late Union Abroad? We do not know, because
      the St. Petersburg Committee contrived to write a “reply”
      which does not contain a single word about the main question. We
      again ask the St. Petersburg comrades—and not only the
      St. Petersburg comrades—does not a polemic that evades the heart of
      the matter threaten to degenerate into an unpleasant wrangle? Is it, in
      fact, worth while engaging in a polemic if there is no desire to examine
      the essentials of the question and to express one’s opinion definitely and
      without reservations, or if it is regarded as premature to do so?

The
      committee here referred to is the St. Petersburg Committee of the League
      of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, which functioned in
      the period following the arrest of Lenin and the majority of the League
      leaders in December 1895; the leadership of the League fell into the
      hands of the “young” Social-Democrats, who supported the
      ’Economist” position.
    

The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class,
      founded by Lenin in the autumn of 1895, united all the Marxist workers’
      study circles in St. Petersburg. It was headed by a Central Group
      (S. I. Radchenko, A. A. Vaneyev, A. A. Yakubova, N. K. Krupskaya,
      G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, V. V. Starkov, and others) under Lenin’s direction.
    

      The League of Struggle headed by Lenin led the revolutionary working-class
      movement, linking the workers’ struggle in support of economic demands
      with the political struggle against tsarism. It was the first organisation
      in Russia to combine socialism with the working-class movement
      and to go over from the propaganda of Marxism among a restricted range of
      advanced workers to political agitation among the working-class masses on
      an extended scale. The League issued leaflets and pamphlets for the
      workers and directed their strike struggles. It was the embryo of the
      revolutionary working-class Marxist Party. The influence of the League was
      felt far beyond St. Petersburg, and similar Leagues of Struggle, pat
      terned upon it, were formed in other cities.
    



[2]

The Emancipation of Labour group was the first Russian Marxist
      group. It was founded in Geneva by G. V. Plekhanov in 1883; the group
      included P. B. Axelrod, L. G. Deutsch, V. I. Zasulich, and V. N. Ignatov.
    

      The group did much to spread Marxism in Russia. It translated such Marxist
      works as the Manifesto of the Communist Party by Marx and Engels;
      Wage-Labour and Capital by Marx; Socialism:

   

Utopian and
      Scientific by Engels; it published them abroad and organised their
      distribution in Russia. Plekhanov and his group dealt a serious blow at
      Narodism. In 1883 Plekhanov drafted a programme for the Russian
      Social-Democrats and in 1885 drew up another. The two drafts were
      published by the Emancipation of Labour group and marked an important step
      towards the establish ment of a Social-Democratic Party in
      Russia. Plekhanov’s Social ism and the Political Struggle (1883),
      Our Differences (1885), and The Development of the Monist
      View of History (1895) played an important role in disseminating
      Marxist views. The group, how ever, made some serious mistakes; it clung
      to remnants of Narodnik views, overestimated the role of the liberal
      bourgeoisie, while underestimating the revolutionary capacity of the
      peasantry. These errors were the first projections of the future Menshevik
      views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group. The group had no
      practical ties with the working-class movement. Lenin pointed out that the
      Emancipation of Labour group “only theoretically founded the
      Social-Democracy and took the first step in the direction of the
      working-class movement” (see present edition, Vol. 20, “The
      Ideological Struggle in the Working-Class Movement”). At the Second
      Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., in August 1903, the Emancipation of Labour
      group announced its dissolution.

      The foreign branch of the Iskra organisation has united with the
      Sotsial-Demokrat revolutionary organisation abroad, and has formed
      with it a single organisation under the name of the League of Russian
      Revolutionary Social-Democracy

      Abroad.[1]

      As will be seen from its published declaration, the new organisation
      proposes to issue a number of propaganda and agitational pamphlets. The
      League is the representative of Iskra abroad. Thus, the
      organisation of revolutionary Social-Democrats abroad, led by the
      Emancipation of Labour group, has finally merged with the organisation
      grouped round our paper. As before, the Emancipation of Labour group will
      participate directly in editing and managing our publications.
    

      The unification of the Russian revolutionary Social- Democratic
      organisations abroad was accomplished after their attempt to combine with
      the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad (which issues Rabocheye
      Dyelo) had failed. Early in summer, a conference of representatives
      of the three organisations drafted an agreement. The basis of the
      agreement was provided by a number of resolutions on matters of principle,
      according to which the Union Abroad would put an end to all flirting with
      Economism and Bernsteinism, and recognise the principles of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy. There was reason to hope that unity would be
      accomplished; for until then the only obstacle to a rapprochement
      was the vacillation of the Union Abroad and of its organ, Rabocheye
      Dyelo, with regard to questions of principle. These hopes were not
      justified, since the recently published No. 10 of Rabocheye Dyelo
      contained editorial articles openly directed against the

    

      resolutions that had been drawn up at the conference with the
      participation of the delegation of the Union Abroad. Apparently, the Union
      Abroad again swerved towards the Bight Wing of our movement. In fact, at
      the conference of the three organisations, the Union Abroad proposed
      “amendments” to the above-mentioned resolutions, which clearly
      showed that it was reverting to its previous deviations. The other
      organisations felt obliged to leave the conference, and in fact did
      so. Apparently, our comrades of the Union Abroad are not yet sufficiently
      aware of the danger of the intermediary position their organisation
      occupies between revolutionary socialism and the opportunism that plays
      into the hands of the liberals. We hope that time and bitter experience
      will convince them of the error of their tactics. The effort observed
      throughout the Party, not only to work for the expansion of our movement,
      but also to raise its qualitative level, is the best guarantee that the
      much- desired unification of all our forces will be accomplished under the
      banner of revolutionary Social-Democracy, which our paper serves.
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]

The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was
      founded on Lenin’s initiative in October 1901. The Iskra Zarya
      organisation abroad and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (which
      included the Emancipation of Labour group) entered the League. The task of
      the League was to disseminate the ideas of rev olutionary Social-Democracy
      and promote the foundation of a mil itant Social-Democratic
      organisation. Actually, the League was the representative of
      Iskra abroad. It recruited supporters for Iskra from
      among Social-Democrats living abroad, gave it materi al support, organised
      its delivery to Russia, and published popular Marxist literature. The
      League issued several Bulletins and pamph lets. The Second
      Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. approved the League as the sole Party
      organisation abroad, accorded it the full rights of a committee working
      under the leadership and control of the Central Committee of the
      R.S.D.L.P.
    

      After the Second Congress the Mensheviks entrenched them selves in the
      League and launched their struggle against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. At
      the Second Congress of the League in October 1903, the Mensheviks libelled
      the Bolsheviks, following which Lenin and his supporters walked out. The
      Mensheviks adopted new Rules for the League that contradicted the Rules of
      the Party adopt ed at the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. From that time
      onwards the League became a bulwark of Menshevism; it continued its
      existence until 1905.

      Once again “provisional regulations”!
    

      This time, however, it is not disobedient students that are affected, but
      peasants who are guilty of starving.
    

      On September 15, the “Provisional Regulations Governing the
      Participation of the Population in the Famine-Affected Areas in the Works
      Undertaken by Order of the Departments of Railways, Agriculture, and State
      Property” received the Imperial sanction and were immediately
      promulgated. When the Russian peasant becomes acquainted with these
      regulations (not from the newspapers, of course, but from personal
      experience), he will obtain further confirmation of the truth knocked into
      him during centuries of enslavement to the landlords and the officials:
      when the officials solemnly declare that the peasant “is to be
      allowed to participate” in any large or small affair, either in
      paying redemption money for the landlords’ land, or in public works
      organised in connection with the famine, some new Egyptian plague must be
      expected.
    

      In actuality, the entire contents of the Provisional Regulations of
      September 15 give the impression of being a new penal law, a supplementary
      regulation to the Penal Code. In the first place, the very organisation
      and management of the works are hemmed in with as much profound
      “caution” and as many bureaucratic complications as if rebels
      or convicts, rather than famine-stricken peasants, were being dealt
      with. One would imagine that the organisation of public works was the
      simplest thing in the world:

      all that is required is that the Zemstvos and other institutions be
      provided with funds and employ workers to

    

      build roads, clear forests, etc. Under ordinary circumstances, this is how
      such works are carried out. Now, however, a new system is introduced. The
      rural superintendent suggests what kind of work is to be done, the
      governor gives his opinion, which is transmitted to the special
      “Conference on Food Affairs” in St. Petersburg, composed of
      representatives of various government departments, under the chairmanship
      of the Deputy Minister of the Interior. More over, the general management
      of this work is vested in the Minister, who may appoint special
      representatives to act on his behalf. The St. Petersburg Committee will
      even fix the maximum pay for the workers, which, no doubt, means that it
      will see to it that the peasant is not “corrupted” by
      excessive pay! Apparently, the object of the Provisional Regulations of
      September 15 is to hinder public works on a large scale,
      precisely as the Sipyagin circular of August 17 hindered relief
      to the famine-stricken.
    

      But still more important and more vicious are the special regulations
      governing the engagement of peasants for public works.
    

      If the work is carried on “away from their place of residence”
      (which naturally affects the overwhelming majority of cases), the workmen
      must form special artels under the surveillance of the rural
      superintendent, who is to approve the overseer responsible for
      maintaining order. Starving peasants must not dare to elect their overseer
      themselves, as workmen usually do. They are placed under the command of
      the rural. superintendent armed with the birch! The names of the members
      of artels are to be entered in a special list, which takes the place
      of the legal residence permit ....

      Instead of individual passports, therefore, there will be lists of artel
      members. The purpose of the change? To restrict the peasant; for,
      with his own passport, he could make better arrangements for himself in
      the new place, or leave the work more easily upon being dissatisfied.
    

      Further, “the maintenance of order en route and the
      delivery of consignments of workmen to the work managers are entrusted to
      officials specially appointed by the Ministry of the Interior”. Free
      workmen are given travelling allowances; serfs are “shipped”
      in listed consignments and “delivered” to special
      officials. Are not the peasants right

    

      in regarding “public” and state work as a new form of serfdom?
    

      Indeed, the law of September 15 reduces the starving peasants to a
      position close to that of serfs, not only be cause it deprives them of the
      freedom of movement. The law gives the officials the right to deduct
      part of their wages to be sent to the workmen’s families “if
      the gubernia authorities in the district where their families
      reside” consider it necessary. The money the workmen earn is to be
      disposed of without their consent. The peasant is stupid; he cannot look
      after his family himself. The authorities can do that far better. Who
      indeed has not heard how well they cared for the peasant families in the
      military

      settlements[1]?
    

      One thing stands in the way, however. The peasants are no longer so
      submissive as they were at the time of the military settlements. They may
      demand ordinary passports and protest against deductions from their wages
      without their consent!  Hence, it is necessary to resort to greater
      stringency, and so a special clause provides that “the preservation
      of order among the workers in the places of work is entrusted by the order
      of the Ministry of the Interior, to the local rural superintendents, the
      officers of the special corps of gendarmerie, police officials, or persons
      specially appointed for the purpose”. Apparently, the government a
      priori regards the starving peasants as “rebels”,
      and, in addition to the general surveillance conducted by the entire
      Russian police force, to which all Russian workers are subjected, it
      establishes an especially strict surveillance. It is decided
      beforehand to treat the peasants with an iron hand for having
      dared to “exaggerate” the famine and for putting forward
      (as Sipyagin expressed himself in his circular) “totally unjustified
      demands on the government”.
    

      To avoid having dealings with the courts in the event of any expression of
      discontent by the workmen, the Provisional Regulations empower the
      officials to place workmen under arrest for a period not exceeding
      three days without trial for disturbing the peace, for failing to
      work conscientiously, and for failing to obey orders. A free workman must
      be brought before a magistrate before whom he may defend himself, and
      against whose sentence he may appeal; but a starving peasant may be
      imprisoned without trial! The only

    

      penalty that can be inflicted upon a free working man for refusing to work
      is dismissal, but according to the new law, “for persistent refusal
      to work” the peasant may be sent back to his home under
      escort, together with thieves and bandits!

    

      The new Provisional
      Regulations are in fact penal servitude regulations for the
      famine-stricken, regulations that sentence them to hard labour and
      deprivation of rights for having dared to importune the officials with
      requests for aid. The government has not been satisfied with depriving the
      Zemstvos of jurisdiction over food distribution, with prohibiting private
      persons from organising food-kitchens without the permission of the
      police, and with ordering real needs to be reduced to one-fifth; it also
      declares the peasant to be without rights and orders him to be punished
      without trial. To the constant penal servitude of a starving existence and
      overwork is now added the threat of penal servitude on public works.
    

      These are the measures taken by the government with respect to the
      peasants. As for the workers, the punishment meted out to them is more
      strikingly described in the “Indictment”, which appeared in
      our last issue, in connection with the unrest at the Obukhov Works in
      May. Iskra dealt with these events in its June and July
      issues. The legal press was silent about the trial, probably remembering
      how even the most loyal Novoye Vremya “suffered” for
      attempting to write on this subject. A few lines appeared in the press to
      the effect that the trial had taken place at the end of September;
      subsequently one of the southern newspapers casually reported the verdict:
      two were sentenced to penal servitude, eight were acquitted, the
      rest were sentenced to imprisonment and detention in houses of correction
      for terms ranging from two to three and a half years.
    

      Thus, in the article, “Another Massacre” (Iskra,

      No. 5),[See present volume,
pp. 25-3O.—Ed.]

      we underestimated the vindictiveness of the Russian
      Government. We believed that in the struggle it had recourse to military
      reprisals as a last resort, fearing to appeal to the courts. It turns out,
      however, that it managed to combine one with the other: after assaulting
      the crowd and killing

    

      three workers, thirty-seven men out of several thousand were seized and
      sentenced to Draconic punishments.
    

      From the indictment we are able to judge to some extent the manner in
      which they were seized and tried. Anton Ivanovich Yermakov, Yephraim
      Stepanovich Dakhin, and Anton Ivanovich Gavrilov are charged with being
      the ringleaders. The indictment states that Yermakov had leaf lets at his
      house (according to the evidence of Mikhailova, an assistant in a
      government liquor shop, who, however, was not called upon to testify
      at the trial), that he talked about the struggle for political
      liberty, and that on April 22 he went to Nevsky Prospekt with a red
      flag. Further it is stressed that Gavrilov, too, possessed and distributed
      leaflets calling for a demonstration on April 22. In regard to the accused
      Yakovleva, the charge is likewise that she participated in certain secret
      gatherings. It is clear, there fore, that the prosecutor sought to single
      out as ringleaders those whom the secret police suspected of being
      politically active workers. The political character of the case is
      apparent also from the fact that the crowd shouted, “We want
      liberty!” and from the connection with the First of May. It should be said
      in passing that it was the dismissal of twenty-six men for “losing
      time” on the First of May that set off the conflagration; but the
      prosecutor, of course, said not a word about the illegality of
      the dismissals!
    

      The case is clear. Those suspected of being political enemies were made to
      stand trial. The secret police submitted the list. And the police
      “confirmed”, of course, that these persons had been in the
      crowd, thrown stones, and stood out among the rest.
    

      The trial was used as a shameful cloak for the second act of political
      vengeance (following the massacre). Politics were mentioned in order to
      make the case appear more serious, but no explanation of the political
      circumstances connected with the case was allowed. The men were tried as
      criminals, according to Article 263 of the Criminal Code, viz., on the
      charge of “overt rebellion against the authorities appointed by the
      government”, rebellion, moreover, by armed persons (?). The charge
      was a frame-up. The police had instructed the judges to examine
      only one side of the case.
    
 

      We wish to point out that according to Articles 263-265 of the Code, a
      sentence of penal servitude may be imposed for participation in a
      demonstration of any kind: for “overt rebellion for the
      purpose of preventing the execution of the orders and measures prescribed
      by the government”, even if the “rebels” were not armed,
      and even if they did not commit any overt act of violence! Russian laws
      mete out sentences of penal servitude with a free hand. It is time we saw
      to it that every such trial is converted into a political trial
      by the accused themselves, so that the government shall not dare in the
      future to conceal its political vindictiveness by the farce of a criminal
      trial!
    

      Yet what “progress”, indeed, is to be observed in the
      administration of justice as compared, for example, with 1885! Then the
      weavers in the Morozov

      mills[2]

      were tried before a judge and a jury, full reports of the trial appeared
      in the press, and at the trial workers came forward as witnesses and
      exposed the outrageous conduct of the employer. But now—a court
      consisting of officials sitting with representatives of the social-estates
      without an opinion of their own, a trial behind closed doors, dumb silence
      on the part of the press, hand-picked witnesses: factory officials;
      watchmen; policemen, who have beaten the people; soldiers, who have shot
      down the workers. What a despicable farce!
    

      If we compare the “progress” made in the reprisals against the
      workers between the years 1885 and 1901 with the “progress”
      made in the struggle against the famine-stricken between the years 1891
      and 1901, we obtain some idea of the rapid spread of popular indignation
      in extent and in depth, and of the rising fury of the government, which is
      “clamping down” on both private philanthropists and the
      peasants, and is terrorising the workers with penal servitude. But threats
      of penal servitude will not terrify workers whose leaders showed no fear
      of death in open street battles with the myrmidons of the tsar. The memory
      of our heroic comrades murdered and tortured to death in prison will
      increase tenfold the strength of the new fighters and will rouse thousands
      to rally to their aid, and like the eighteen-year-old Marfa Yakovleva,
      they will openly say:

      “We stand by our brothers!” In addition to reprisals by the police
      and the military against participants in demonstrations,

    

      the government intends to prosecute them for rebellion; we will retaliate
      by uniting our revolutionary forces and winning over to our side all who
      are oppressed by the tyranny of tsarism, and by systematically preparing
      for the uprising of the whole people!

Military settlements—a special organisation of the Russian
      army introduced under Tsar Alexander I. By organising these settlements
      the tsarist government expected to curtail expenditure on the maintenance

   

of the army, ensure a source of trained reserves, and ob tain a reliable
      force for use against the growing revolutionary movement. The
      arch-reactionary A. A. Arakcheyev, Minister for War, was appointed head of
      the military settlements (hence the name—Arakcheyev settlements).
    

      All peasants living on the territory allotted to the settlements were made
      soldiers for life. Army units were made up of settlers between the ages of
      18 and 45 years (“farmers”) and all other peasants fit for military
      service became “assistant farmers”. Every farmer-settler had
      to feed three of the soldiers quartered on the settlement. All the
      settlers had to wear army uniform and undergo constant army
      training. Their whole lives were subordinated to a severe regime,
      everything, even family relations, coming under the strict
      regulations. Army drill and compulsory army work did not leave the
      peasants sufficient time for work on their faring which gradually fell
      into ruin.
    

      The unbearable, prison-like conditions of life and work in the military
      settlements led to a number of large-scale revolts, which were suppressed
      with incredible cruelty.
    

      Military settlements were abolished in 1857.

Review of Home Affairs


I. Famine[6]

      Again famine! The last ten years have been marked, not only by the ruin of
      the peasantry, but by its veritable extinction, which has proceeded with
      such an astonishing rapidity that no war, however prolonged and bitter,
      has claimed such a host of victims. The most powerful forces of modern
      times are massed against the peasant: world capitalism, which is
      developing at an ever increasing rate, has created transoceanic
      competition, and has provided the small minority of farmers able to hold
      out in the desperate struggle for survival with the most improved methods
      and implements of production; and the militarist state, whose adventurous
      policy in its colonial possessions in the Far East and Central Asia
      involves enormous costs heavily burdening the masses of working people,
      the state which, in addition, is organising at the people’s expense ever
      newer “suppression” and “restraints” to counteract the
      growing discontent and indignation of the masses.
    

      Since famine has become a usual phenomenon in our country, it would .be
      natural to expect that the government would try to fix and strengthen its
      usual food distribution policy. While in 1891-92 the government was caught
      unawares and was at first thrown into consternation, now, however, it is
      rich in experience and knows precisely where (and how) to proceed. In its
      July issue (No. 6), Iskra wrote: “At this moment a black
      cloud of people’s distress is threatening our country and the government
      is once again making preparations for the exercise of its disgraceful
      function of brute violence to deprive the starving people of bread and
      punish everyone who, contrary to government policy, renders aid to the
      hungry.”
    
 

      The government’s preparations were swift and determined. The spirit in
      which they were made is illustrated by the Elizavetgrad affair. Prince
      Obolensky, Governor of Kherson Gubernia, immediately declared war upon
      all who dared to write or speak about the famine in Elizavetgrad, appeal
      for public aid for the famine-stricken, form private groups, and invite
      private persons to organise this aid. The Zemstvo doctors wrote to the
      newspapers stating that famine was raging in the uyezd, that the people
      were disease-stricken and were dying, and that the “bread”
      they were eating was something unbelievable, not deserving to be called
      bread. The governor launched a polemic against the doctors and published
      official denials. Anyone at all acquainted with the general conditions
      under which our press has to work, anyone who will take the trouble to
      recall the severe persecution to which even moderate organs and
      incomparably more moderate authors have been subjected recently, will
      understand the significance of this “polemic” between the head
      of a gubernia and mere Zemstvo doctors who are not even in government
      service. It was simply an act of gagging them, an outright declaration
      without any ceremony that the government would not tolerate the truth
      about the famine. But what is a mere declaration? Whatever may be said of
      others, the Russian Government certainly cannot be reproached with
      restricting itself to mere declarations when the opportunity exists to
      “apply power”. And Prince Obolensky hastened to apply power;
      he appeared personally on the scene of war—war upon the
      famine-stricken and upon those who, though not on the pay roll of any
      department, desired to render real aid to the famine-stricken;
      and he prohibited a number of private persons (including Madame
      Uspenskaya), who had come to the famine-stricken area, from opening
      food-kitchens. Like Julius Caesar, Prince Obolensky came, saw, and
      conquered; and the telegraph promptly informed the entire Russian reading
      public of his victory. One thing is perplexing—that this victory,
      this brazen challenge to all Russians who have retained at least a shred
      of decency, a grain of civic courage, met with no opposition whatever from
      those who, one may say, were most interested in the matter. Very many
      persons in Kherson Gubernia doubtless knew—and know now—the
      reason for the silence about the famine and

    

      the fight against famine relief; but no one has published a single
      statement on this instructive case, or the relevant documents, or even a
      simple appeal to protest against the monstrous prohibition of
      food-kitchens. When the government carries out its threat to dismiss all
      who “lost time” on the First of May, the workers declare a
      strike; but the intelligentsia keeps silent when intellectuals are
      prohibited... from rendering aid to the famine-stricken.
    

      Encouraged, as it were, by success in the first skirmish with the
      “sowers of discord” who dare to aid the famine-stricken, the
      government soon launched an attack all along the line. Prince Obolensky’s
      valiant exploit was elevated to a guiding principle, into a law, which
      would henceforth regulate the relations between all administrators and all
      persons accessory to the distribution of food (the word
      “accessory”, strictly speaking, is a term in criminal law
      peculiar to the Penal Code; but as we have seen and shall see below, at
      the present time rendering aid to the famine-stricken without authority is
      regarded as a crime). Such a law was soon enacted— this time in the
      simplified form of “a circular from the Minister of the Interior to
      all governors of gubernias affected by the harvest failure of 1901”
      (August 17, 1901, No. 20).
    

      It may be assumed that this circular will serve for many years to come as
      a souvenir of the monumental heights to which police fear rises in the
      face of the people’s distress, a fear of closer ties between the
      famine-stricken people and the “intellectuals” who desire to
      help them; at the same time, it is a fear that reveals a firm intention to
      suppress all “clamour” about the famine and to restrict relief
      to the most insignificant scope. One can only regret that the immoderate
      length of the circular and the ponderous official style in which it is
      written will hinder the public at large from becoming acquainted with its
      contents.
    

      It will be remembered that the law of June 12, 1900, took the management
      of food affairs out of the hands of the Zemstvos and transferred it to the
      rural superintendents and uyezd congresses. What, it seemed, could be more
      reliable?  The elective principle was eliminated; persons in any way
      independent of the authorities would have no jurisdiction and consequently
      would make no more noise. But after Prince Obolensky’s campaign, all this
      appeared to be

    

      inadequate. The whole business must be more strictly subordinated to the
      Ministry and to the officials directly carrying out its orders; the
      slightest possibility of exaggeration must be definitely removed. For that
      reason, the question as to which uyezds are “affected by the harvest
      failure” is from now on to be decided exclusively by the

      Ministry,[1]

      which apparently is to serve as the headquarters for the general staff for
      conducting military operations against the famine-stricken. Through the
      medium of the governors, these headquarters will direct the activities of
      the individuals (principally the uyezd marshals of the nobility) in whose
      hands the Central Uyezd Food Board is concentrated. The initiator of
      military operations against the famine-stricken, Prince Obolensky, was
      obliged to travel personally to the district in order to prohibit,
      restrain, and curtail. Now, everything is “regulated”, and all
      that is necessary is an exchange of telegrams (possible, thanks to the
      grant of a thousand rubles per uyezd for office expenses) between the
      Central Uyezd Board and the St. Petersburg Central Board for the necessary
      “orders” to be given. Turgenev’s civilised landlord not only
      kept away from the stables, but even gave orders in subdued tones to a
      livened footman in white gloves: “See that Fyodor gets

      it...”[7]

      So it will be here now; “orders” will be given, “without
      clamour”, nicely and quietly, to restrain the immoderate appetites
      of the starving population.
    

      The fact that Mr. Sipyagin is convinced that the appetite of the starving
      peasant is immoderate becomes evident,

    

      not only from the persistent warnings in the circular against
      “exaggeration”, but from the new regulations it lays down
      which remove all possibility of exaggeration. Do not be in a hurry to draw
      up the lists of the distressed, for this will arouse among the population
      “exaggerated hopes”, the Minister states explicitly, and
      orders that the lists be drawn up only immediately before grain is to be
      distributed. Furthermore, the circular regards it as superfluous to
      determine when an uyezd should be considered a distressed area;
      but it distinctly states when an uyezd should not be considered a
      distressed area (e.g., when not more than one-third of the volosts are
      affected, when usual auxiliary employment is available, etc.). Finally, in
      regard to the rate of relief to be granted to the famines-stricken, the
      Minister introduces regulations which show with extreme clarity that the
      government desires at all costs to cut down these grants to the
      very minimum, to mere doles that do nothing to secure the population
      against starvation. In point of fact, the quota is forty-eight poods of
      grain per family (calculated on the average yield of the harvest in each
      village), and those who possess that amount or more are not in need. How
      this figure was arrived at, no one knows. All that is known is that in
      non-famine years even the poorest peasant consumes twice as much
      grain (cf. Zemstvo Statistical Investigation of Peas ants’
      Budgets). Consequently, undernourishment is considered a normal state
      according to the Minister’s prescript. But even this quota is reduced,
      first by half, in order to prevent the working elements, which represent
      about fifty per cent of the population, from obtaining loans, and
      then by one-third, one-fifth, and one-tenth, “in proportion to
      the approximate number of well-to-do farmers having stocks left over from
      last year, or any other [literally so: “or any other”!] material
      resources”. One can judge from this what an insignificant fraction
      of the amount of grain actually required by the population will be
      represented by the loan the government intends to grant. And, as if
      rejoicing in his insolence, Mr. Sipyagin, in explaining this incredible
      system of curtailing relief, declares that such an approximate computation
      “has rarely been found to be greatly exaggerated”. Comment is
      superfluous.
    
 

      Whenever official declarations of the Russian Government contain something
      more than bare instructions and make at least some attempt to explain
      them, they almost invariably —it is a kind of law more stable than
      the majority of our laws —advance two principal motives or rather
      two principal types of motives. On the one hand, we invariably find a
      number of general phrases, written in pompous style, about official
      solicitude and a desire to meet the requirements of the time and the
      wishes of public opinion. Thus, reference is made to the “important
      task of averting a food shortage among the rural population”, to the
      “moral responsibility for the welfare of the local
      population”, etc. It goes without saying that these commonplaces
      signify nothing and impose no definite obligation; but they are as alike
      as two peas to the immortal sermons delivered by the immortal Judas
      Golovlyov to the peasants he had robbed. Parenthetically it should be
      said, these commonplaces are constantly exploited (sometimes out of
      simple-mindedness and sometimes as a “duty”) by the censored liberal
      press whereby to demonstrate that the government shares its point of view.
    

      But if the other, less general and less obviously hollow motives of the
      government’s orders are examined more closely, concrete statements will
      always be found which repeat in toto the established arguments of
      the most reactionary organs of our press (e.g., Moskovskiye
      Vedomosti). We are of the opinion that it would be well worth while
      (and quite possible even for those who work legally) to follow up and
      record every case of this solidarity between the government and
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti. In the circular under discussion, for
      example, we find a repetition of the vile accusations levelled by the
      terribly “wild landlords” to the effect that the premature
      compilation of lists of the distressed stimulates “efforts among
      certain well-to-do householders to give their farms an appearance of
      poverty by selling their supplies, reserves, and implements”. The
      Minister states that this “has been proved by experience in the
      course of previous food campaigns”. Consequently? Consequently, the
      Minister acquires his political experience from the lessons taught him by
      the most hidebound serf-owners, who raised such a clamour in previous
      famine years, who are clamouring now

    

      about the deceit of the peasants, and who are so indignant over the
      “noise” that is being raised about the epidemic of famine
      typhus.
    

      It was from these serf-owners also that Mr. Sipyagin learned to talk about
      demoralisation. “It is extremely important,” he writes, “for
      ... the local institutions ... to help economise the allocated funds and,
      above all [sic!!], prevent the unjustified grants of government
      relief to persons who are materially secure, because of the harmful and
      demoralising effect of such grants." This shameless instruction to help
      economise the funds is sealed by the following advice based on a point of
      principle: ". . .wide distribution of food grants to families that
      can dispense with them [that can subsist on twenty-four poods of grain a
      year per family?], apart from being an unproductive [!] expenditure of
      state funds, will be no less harmful from the standpoint of the benefits
      and requirements of the state than if those really in distress were left
      without proper aid." In bygone times, monarchs would in their sentimental
      moments say: “It is better to acquit ten criminals than to convict
      one innocent man”; but nowadays the right arm of the tsar declares:

      It is as harmful to give relief to families that can manage on twenty-four
      poods of grain a year as to leave families “really” in need
      without relief. What a pity that this magnificently candid “point of
      view” regarding “the benefits and requirements of the
      state” is obscured from the eyes of the general public by a lengthy
      and dull circular! One hope is left: perhaps the Social-Democratic press
      and Social-Democratic oral agitation will enable the people to become more
      closely acquainted with the contents of the ministerial circular.
    
 *     *  * 

      But the circular directs an especially vigorous “attack” upon
      private philanthropists. Everything indicates that the administrators, who
      are waging war against the famine stricken, consider the most important
      “enemy” position to be private relief circles, private
      food-kitchens, etc. With laudable frankness Mr. Sipyagin explains why
      private philanthropy has for a long time now given the Ministry of the
      Interior sleepless nights. “Beginning with the poor harvest

    

      of 1891 and 1892, and during all subsequent calamities of a similar kind,”
      says the circular, “it has not infrequently been found that certain
      philanthropists, while rendering material aid to the inhabitants of the
      affected districts, strive to rouse among them discontent with the present
      system and encourage the people to make totally unjustified demands on the
      government. At the same time, the failure to meet the distress to the
      full, and the inevitable ailments and economic disorders that arise
      therefrom, create an extremely favourable soil for anti-government
      agitation; politically unreliable persons freely take advantage of this
      and pursue their criminal aims under the cloak of helping their
      neighbour. Usually, as soon as the first news of a serious harvest failure
      is received, persons with a political past that is not irreproachable pour
      into the affected districts from all directions, strive to make contact
      with representatives of charitable organisations and institutions from the
      capital, who, through ignorance, engage those persons as local helpers and
      in this way create serious difficulties inimical to the interests of good
      order and administration.”
    

      However, the Russian Government is becoming hard pressed in the land of
      Russia. Time was when only the student youth was considered as a stratum
      calling for special security measures. The students were subjected to the
      strictest surveillance, contact with them on the part of persons whose
      political past is not irreproachable was regarded as a great offence,
      every study circle and society, even if it pursued purely philanthropic
      aims, was suspected of anti-government aims, etc. In those times—not
      far in the past—there was no other stratum, to say nothing
      of a social class, that in the eyes of the government, represented
      “an extremely favourable soil for anti-government
      agitation”. But since the middle nineties, one meets in official
      government communications mention of another, immeasurably more numerous,
      social class that calls for special security measures—the factory
      workers. The growth of the labour movement compelled the government to
      establish a full-fledged system of institutions to maintain surveillance
      over this new stormy element. Among the districts prohibited as places of
      residence for politically doubtful persons were included factory centres
      and settlements, uyezds and whole

    

      gubernias, in addition to the capitals and university

      cities.[2]

      Two-thirds of European Russia came under special protection against
      unreliable elements, while the remaining third is becoming so crowded with
      “persons whose political past is not irreproachable” that even
      the remotest province is becoming

      restless.[3]

      It now appears that according to the authoritative judgement of so
      competent a person as the Minister of the Interior even the remotest
      village represents “favourable soil” for
      anti-government agitation, insofar as there occur in it cases of not fully
      relieved distress, of sickness, and of economic disorder. And are there
      many Russian villages in which such “cases” are not constant? And
      should not we Russian Social-Democrats immediately take advantage of
      Mr. Sipyagin’s instructive reference to “favourable” soil? On
      the one hand, precisely at this moment, the rural districts are displaying
      interest in the rumours which at times have managed to penetrate to them
      in one way or another about the skirmishes that occurred between the
      government’s gendarmes and the urban proletariat and the young
      intelligentsia in February and March. On the other hand, do not phrases
      like the peasant’s “totally unjustified demands”, etc.,
      provide a sufficiently wide programme for the most extensive, all-round
      agitation?
    

      We must take advantage of Mr. Sipyagin’s useful information and laugh at
      his simplicity. It is indeed the sheerest naïveté to imagine
      that by placing private charity under the supervision and control of the
      governor he can hinder the spread of the influence of
      “unreliable” persons in the rural districts. Genuine
      philanthropists have never pursued political aims, so that the new
      measures of prohibition and restriction will mostly affect the very
      persons who are least dangerous to the government. Those, however, who
      desire to

    

      open the eyes of the peasants to the real significance of these measures,
      and to the government’s attitude towards the famine, will not consider it
      necessary to establish con tact with representatives of the Red Cross or
      present them selves to the governors. Thus, when it was found that the
      factory environment represented “favourable soil”, those who
      desired to establish contact with that environment did not visit the
      factory managers for information about factory conditions or present
      themselves to the factory inspectors for permission to organise meetings
      with the workers. We are fully aware, of course, that it is extremely
      difficult to carry on political agitation among the peasantry, the more so
      since it is impossible and irrational to withdraw revolutionary forces
      from the cities for that purpose. Yet we must not lose sight of the fact
      that the government’s heroic deeds, such as restricting private charity,
      remove a good half of these difficulties and do half our work for us.
    
 *     *  * 

      We shall not dwell on the same Minister’s circular calling for stricter
      surveillance over charitable concerts, theatrical performances, etc.; for
      that is a “mere bagatelle”, as compared with the circular we
      have just examined (cf. article “Fresh Obstacles”,
      Iskra, No. 9).
    

      We will endeavour to establish the relation that exists now between the
      government relief for the population, fixed and distributed according to
      the new regulations, and the actual extent of the distress. True, our
      information on this point is exceedingly scanty. The press now is
      thoroughly muzzled, the voices of private organisers of food-kitchens have
      been silenced simultaneously with the “prohibition” of their
      activities, and the only sources of information available to the Russian
      public, now struck dumb by the new stringent measures, are the official
      police reports on the favourable progress of the food campaign, the
      articles written in the same spirit in Moskovskiye Vedomosti,
      sometimes the interviews of an idle reporter with this or that
      Jack-in-office pompously expatiating on “His Excellency’s singleness
      of mind and His Excellency’s singleness of authority,

      etc.”.[8]

      Thus, Novoye Vremya, No. 9195,

    

      reports that the Governor of Saratov, A. P. Engelhardt (formerly Governor
      of Archangel), gave an interview to a representative of a local newspaper,
      in the course of which he said that he had personally convened in that
      locality a conference of marshals of the nobility, of representatives of
      the Zemstvo Boards, of the rural superintendents, and of representatives
      of the Red Cross, at which he had “distributed tasks”.
    

      “Scurvy, in the form I have seen it in Archangel Gubernia, is not to
      be found here [said A. P. Engelhardt]. In Archangel, one cannot approach
      within five paces of a patient; there the disease is really a form of
      ’rot’. Here we see mostly the effects of severe anaemia, which results
      from the awful conditions of domestic life. Almost the only symptoms of
      scurvy observed here are white lips and white gums.... With proper
      nutrition such patients recover within a week. Food is now being
      distributed. About one thousand rations are being distributed daily,
      although not more than four hundred cases of acute distress have been
      registered.
    

      “Besides scurvy, only three cases of typhus have been reported in the
      whole district. We may hope that things will not get worse, for everywhere
      public works have been organised and the population is assured of
      employment.”
    

      What prosperity! In the whole of Khvalynsk Uyezd (to which the
      Jack-in-office refers) there are only four hundred persons in acute
      distress (in all probability the rest, in Mr. Sipyagin’s and
      Mr. Engelhardt’s opinion, “can manage well” on twenty-four
      poods of grain per family per annum!), the population is provided for, and
      the sick recover within a week. After this, how can we not believe
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti when, in a special leading article (in
      No. 258), it informs us that “according to the latest reports, in
      twelve gubernias affected by the harvest failure the administration is
      very actively organising relief. Many uyezds have already been
      investigated for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is a shortage
      of food; uyezd managers of food affairs have been
      appointed, etc. Apparently, official representatives of the
      government are doing everything possible to render timely and adequate
      aid.”
    

      “...very actively organising”, and ... “not more than four hundred
      cases of acute distress have been registered”....

    

      in Khvalynsk Uyezd there are 165,000 rural inhabitants, and one thousand rations
      are being distributed. The yield of rye in the whole of the south-eastern
      area (including Saratov Gubernia) this year was 34 per cent below
      average. Of the total area of peasant lands planted to crops in Saratov
      Gubernia (1,500,000 dessiatines), 15 per cent suffered a complete failure
      of the harvest (according to the report of the gubernia Zemstvo Board) and
      75 per cent suffered a poor harvest, while Khvalynsk and Kamyshin uyezds
      are the two worst affected uyezds in the gubernia. Consequently, the total
      amount of grain gathered in by the peasants in Khvalynsk Uyezd is at least
      30 per cent below average. Let us assume that half of this shortage
      affects the well-to-do peasantry, which is not yet reduced thereby to
      starvation (a very risky assumption, since the well-to-do peasant
      possesses better land and cultivates it better, so that he always suffers
      less from a bad harvest than do the poor peasants). But even on this
      assumption, the number of the starving must be something like 15 per cent,
      or about 25,000. Yet we are offered the consolation that scurvy in
      Khvalynsk is not nearly so bad as it is in Archangel, that there were only
      three cases of typhus (if only they would lie more cleverly!), and that
      one thousand rations are being distributed (the size of which is in all
      probability determined by Sipyagin’s system of combating exaggerations).
    

      With respect to the “subsidiary earnings”, which, to avoid
      exaggeration, Mr. Sipyagin thrice takes into account in his
      circular (once, when he orders that uyezds in which subsidiary earnings
      are usual shall not be regarded as affected areas; a second time when he
      orders that the forty-eight poods scale be reduced by half because 50 per
      cent of the working population “must” be earning wages; and a
      third time when he orders this scale to be further reduced by amounts
      ranging from one-third to one-tenth according to local conditions)
      —with respect to these subsidiary earnings, not only agricultural
      but even non-agricultural earnings have diminished in Saratov
      Gubernia. “The harvest failure,” we read in the above-mentioned
      Zemstvo Board report, “has also affected the handicraftsmen, due to
      the drop in the sales of their manufactures. Owing to these circumstances,
      a crisis .e observed in the uyezds in which handicrafts
      are most highly

    

      developed.” Among these is Kamyshin Uyezd, which has suffered most, and in
      which many thousands of poor people are engaged in weaving the celebrated
      local striped calico (sarpinka). Even in normal years conditions
      in the handicraft industry of this remote rural district were woeful; six-
      and seven-year-old children, for example, were employed at a wage of seven
      or eight kopeks a day. We can picture to ourselves what conditions are
      like there in a year of severe harvest failure and acute crisis in the
      handicraft industry.
    

      In Saratov Gubernia (and in all affected gubernias, of course), the poor
      grain harvest is accompanied also by a shortage of fodder. The past few
      months (i.e., in the second half of the summer!) have seen the spread of
      various cattle diseases and an increase in cattle
      mortality. “According to a report of the veterinary surgeon in
      Khvalynsk Uyezd [we quote from the newspaper that contained the
      above-mentioned Zemstvo Board report], an examination of the contents of
      the stomachs of the dead cattle revealed nothing but earth.”
    

      The “Report of the Zemstvo Department of the Ministry of the
      Interior” on the progress of the food campaign contained,
      incidentally, the statement that of the uyezds recognised as affected
      areas “in Khvalynsk alone a number of cases of epidemic scurvy have
      been discovered in two villages since July. The local medical staff is
      exerting all its efforts to stop the epidemic and two Red Cross
      detachments have been sent to the district to assist the local
      forces. According to the report of the governor [the very
      A. P. Engelhardt, whose acquaintance we have made], their efforts are
      meeting with considerable success; according to reports received by the
      Ministry up to September 12, in none of the other affected uyezds were
      there any cases of acute distress left without relief, and no development
      of disease as a consequence of inadequate nutrition is observed.”
    

      To show what confidence may be placed in the statement that no cases of
      acute distress were left unrelieved (were there cases of
      chronic distress?) and that the development of disease is not
      observed, we shall confine ourselves to comparing data on two other
      gubernias.
    

      In Ufa Gubernia, Menzelinsk and Belebeyev uyezds were declared to be affected
      areas, and the Zemstvo Department

    

      of the Ministry of the Interior reports that “according to the
      governor’s statement” the amount of the government grant required
      “specifically for food” is 800,000 poods. However, a special
      meeting of the Ufa Gubernia Zemstvo. Assembly held on August 27 to discuss
      the question of rendering relief to the famine-stricken estimated food
      requirements of those uyezds at 2,200,000 poods of grain, 1,000,000 poods
      for the other uyezds, not including grants of seed-grain (3,200,000 poods
      for the entire gubernia) and cattle fodder (600,000 poods). Consequently,
      the Ministry fixed the grant at one-fourth the amount fixed by
      the Zemstvo.
    

      Another instance. In Vyatka Gubernia none of the uyezds was declared
      affected areas at the time when the Zemstvo department issued its report;
      nevertheless, the food grant was fixed by that body at 782,000 poods. This
      is the figure which, by press reports, was fixed by the Vyatka Gubernia
      Food Department at its meeting of August 28 (in accordance with the
      decisions of the Uyezd Assemblies held between August 18 and
      25). Approximately on August 12, these very Assemblies had fixed
      a different amount for the grant, viz., 1,100,000 poods for food and
      1,400,000 poods for seed. Why this difference? What happened between
      August 12 and 28? The answer is, Sipyagin’s circular of August 17 on
      fighting the famine-stricken had been published. Consequently, the
      circular had an immediate effect, and the trifling amount of 230,000 poods
      of grain was struck out of the estimate, drawn up, mark you, by the Uyezd
      Assemblies, i.e., by the very institutions which, by the law of June 12,
      1900, were established in place of the unreliable Zemstvos, institutions
      composed of officials generally and of rural superintendents in
      particular.... Shall we really live to see the day when even the rural
      superintendents will be accused of liberalism? Perhaps we shall. Recently
      we read in Moskovskiye Vedomosti the following reprimand
      inflicted on a certain Mr. Om., who, in Priazovsky

Krai[9]

      had dared to propose that the newspapers publish the minutes of the
      meetings of the Gubernia Boards for Urban Affairs (since press
      representatives were not permitted to attend them):
    

      “The purpose is all too transparent: the Russian civil servant
frequently suffers from a fear of appearing illiberal, and publicity may
      compel him, at times even against his

    

      own conscience, to support some fantastically liberal scheme proposed by
      the city or the Zemstvo. By no means an altogether false calculation.”
    

      Should not the Vyatka rural superintendents, who. (apparently out of fear of
      appearing illiberal) have revealed such unpardonable frivolity in
      “exaggerating” the food crisis, be placed under special

      surveillance?[4]


      Incidentally, if the wise Russian Government had not withdrawn from it
      jurisdiction over food affairs, the “fantastically liberal”
      Vyatka Zemstvo would have gone even further in its estimate of the
      distress. At all events, the Special Gubernia Conference, held from August
      30 to September 2, declared the amount of grain harvested to be 17 per
      cent, and the amount of cattle fodder 15 per cent, below

    

      subsistence needs. The amount absolutely essential is 105,000,000 poods
      (the amount harvested in an ordinary year being 134,000,000; in this year,
      84,000,000 poods). There is, therefore, a shortage of 21 million
      poods. “The total number of volosts in the gubernia suffering
      from a shortage of grain this year is 158 out of 310. The population of
      these volosts numbers 1,566,000 persons of both sexes.” Yes, undoubtedly,
      “the administration is very actively organising”—minimising
      the real extent of the distress and reducing the work of relieving the
      starving to a kind of acrobatics of cheese-paring philanthropy.
    

      In fact, the term “acrobats of philanthropy” would be too
      flattering a name for the administrators who have rallied under the banner
      of the Sipyagin circular. What they have in common with acrobats of
      philanthropy is the paltry nature of the relief they render and their
      attempts to blow it up into something bigger than it is. But the acrobats
      of philanthropy at worst regard the people upon whom they bestow their
      charity as playthings that pleasantly tickle their vanity, whereas the
      Sipyagin administrators regard their beneficiaries as enemies, as people
      that make illegal demands ("totally unjustified demands on the
      government”) and that must therefore be held in restraint. This point of
      view was expressed most strikingly in the remarkable Provisional
      Regulations, which were accorded royal sanction on September 15, 1901.
    

      These regulations represent in the full sense a law, which consists of
      twenty articles and contains so much that is remarkable that we would not
      hesitate to designate it as one of the most important legislative acts of
      the early twentieth century. To begin with the title: “Provisional
      Regulations Governing the Participation of the Population in the
      Famine-Affected Areas in the Works Undertaken by Order of the Departments
      of Railways, Agriculture, and State Property.” Evidently these works are
      so chock-full of benefits that to be allowed to “participate”
      in them must be regarded as a special act of grace, otherwise the first
      clause of the new law would not state: “Rural inhabitants of
      localities affected by the famine shall be allowed to participate
      in the carrying out of the works projects”, etc.
    
 

      But the law provides for these “privileges” only in its second
      half, while in the first it deals with the organisation of the
      whole business. The competent authorities “determine the most
      suitable works projects to be undertaken” (Article 2), which
      “shall be carried out in conformity with the provision in the
      law” (Article 3, which, like the chapter headings in some Dickensian
      novel, may be entitled: “The clause of the new law, which tells of
      the necessity of acting in accordance with the old law”). The public works
      are to be launched on budget estimates, or on special credits, and the
      general supervision of the organisation of these works is vested in the
      Minister of the Interior, who may appoint officials with special powers
      and who arranges a special “Conference on Food Affairs” with
      representatives of various ministries

      participating under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister. The functions
      of this body include: (a) granting permission for departures from the
      existing regulations; (b) discussing proposals for the allocation of
      funds; (c) “fixing the maximum remuneration to be paid to workmen,
      as well as establishing the other conditions under which the population
      may be permitted to participate in the aforesaid works; (d) distributing
      the work crews to the locations of the projects; and, (e) organising the
      transport of the crews to the works locations”. The decisions of the
      Conference must be sanctioned by the Minister of the Interior, as well as,
      “in corresponding cases”, by the ministers of other
      departments. The function of determining the works projects, and of
      ascertaining the number of residents in. need of work, is vested in the
      rural superintendents, who must report the information to the governors,
      who, in turn, communicate the information with their opinions to the
      Ministry of the Interior and “on its instructions arrange, through
      the rural superintendents, for the dispatch of workers to the works
      locations....”
    

      Ugh! At last we have mastered the “organisation” of this new
      business! The question now arises how much lubrication will be required to
      set all the wheels of this ponderous, purely Russian administrative
      monster in motion. Try to imagine this thing concretely. Only the rural
      superintendent comes in direct contact with the famine-stricken. He
      therefore must take the initiative. He sends a communi

    

      cation—to whom? To the governor, says an article of the Provisional
      Regulations of September 15. But in accordance with the circular of August
      17, a special Central Uyezd Food Board has been established, whose
      function is “to concentrate the management of all food
      affairs in the uyezd in the hands of a single official” (under the
      circular of August 17 the uyezd marshal of the nobility should preferably
      be appointed to that post). A “dispute” arises, which, of
      course, is quickly settled on the basis of the remarkably clear and simple
      “principles” outlined in the six points of Article 175 of the
      General Gubernia Regulations which prescribes “the order for
      settling,disputes ... between public departments and officials”. In
      the end the document finds its way somehow into the office of the
      governor, where someone undertakes to draft an
      “opinion”. Following which, everything goes to St. Petersburg,
      there to be examined by the special Conference. But the representative of
      the Ministry of Railways to the Conference is unable to decide on the
      expediency of such a public works project as road re pairs in Buguruslan
      Uyezd, and so another document travels from St. Petersburg to the gubernia
      and back again. When, finally, the expediency of the works, etc., etc., is
      decided on in principle, the Conference in St. Petersburg will then set
      about “distributing the work crews” between Buzuluk and
      Buguruslan uyezds.
    

      How shall this unwieldy machine be explained? By the novelty of the thing?
      Not at all. Before the Provisional Regulations of September 15 were
      introduced, public works could be organised ever so much more simply
      “on the basis of the existing laws”, and the circular of
      August 17, which refers to the public works organised by the Zemstvos, the
      Guardians of the poor, and the gubernia authorities, makes no reference to
      the necessity for any kind of special organisation. You see, therefore,
      that the government’s “food campaign” consists in the fact
      that the St. Petersburg departments spend a whole month (from August 17 to
      September 15) thinking and thinking, and finally produce a hopelessly
      tangled skein of red tape. We may be sure, however, that the
      St. Petersburg Conference stands in no danger of making exaggerations, as
      do the local bureaucrats who “fear to appear illiberal”....
    
 

      But the prize exhibit of the new Provisional Regulations is the prescript
      concerning the “rural inhabitants” hired for the works
      projects. When work is to be carried out “away from their place of
      residence”, the workers must first of all form themselves into a
      special artel, “under the supervision of the rural
      superintendent”, who endorses the appointment of the artel overseer
      responsible for maintaining order; secondly, the names of the workmen
      joining such an artel must be entered in a special list which “is to
      serve as a substitute for the ordinary legally established
      residence permits of the workmen thereon listed during their transfer to,
      and stay at, their place of work, and which must remain in the possession
      of the official accompanying the workmen on their journey, or, in his
      absence, in the possession of the artel overseer, and on arrival at the
      destination must be placed in charge of the works manager”.
    

      Why is it necessary to substitute a special list for the ordinary
      passports, which every peasant who desires to travel has a right to
      receive gratis? This is clearly a restriction imposed upon the workmen,
      since, if they remained in possession of their passports, they would have
      more freedom in selecting a room, in spending their free time, or in
      changing one job for another, if they found it more remunerative or
      convenient to do so. We shall see below that this was done deliberately,
      not only out of love for red tape, but specifically in order to impose
      restrictions upon the workmen and make their conditions approximate those
      of gangs of transported serfs accompanied by an “inventory” of
      a

      kind.[10]

      It appears that the function of “maintaining order on the journey,
      and the delivery [sic!] of the work crew to the public works
      manager is vested in an official commissioned for the purpose by the
      Ministry of the Interior”. The farther into it we get, the more
      complicated it becomes. The substitution of lists for passports leads to
      the substitution of freedom of movement by—"consignment of work
      crews”. What have we here? Gangs of convicts being transported to
      penal servitude? Have all the laws permitting the peasant in possession of
      a passport to travel wherever and however he pleases been
      repealed—perhaps as a punishment for “exaggerating” the
      famine?  Is conveyance at government expense a sufficient reason for
      depriving a citizen of his rights?

    
 

      To continue. It appears that the persons in charge of distributing the
      workmen and of paying their wages, as well as the other officials of the
      department supervising the execution of the works projects, “on the
      instructions of the gubernia authorities in the district where the
      families of the workmen reside, dock the wages earned, wherever possible,
      and send the deducted amount to their home locations for the maintenance
      of the workmen’s families”. A further deprivation of rights. How
      dare the officials deduct part of the wages earned by the workers? How
      dare they interfere in the work men’s family affairs and decide for them,
      as if they were serfs, whom they are to maintain and how much they are to
      con tribute to that end? Would workmen permit their wages to be docked
      without their consent? Apparently, this question entered the heads of
      those who drafted the new “penal servitude regulations”,
      because the clause immediately following the one quoted above says:
      “The preservation of order among the workmen in the works locations
      is entrusted, by decision of the Minister of the Interior, to the local
      rural superintendents, to the officers of the special corps of
      gendarmerie, to the police officials, or to persons specially appointed
      for that purpose.” It is clear that the peasants are to be
      punished by deprivation of their rights for
      “exaggerating” the famine and for their “totally
      unjustified demands on the government”! It is not enough that the ordinary
      police, the factory police, and the secret police keep the Russian workers
      in general under surveillance; these regulations prescribe the
      establishment of a special surveillance. One might think the
      government has completely lost its head out of fear of these work crews of
      hungry peasants, freighted, transported, and delivered with a thousand
      precautions.
    

      We read further: “Workers guilty of disturbing the public peace and
      quiet, deliberately shirking their work, or refusing to carry out the
      lawful demands of the works managers or those appointed for the purpose of
      preserving order, are liable, on the order of the officials mentioned in
      Article 16 [referred to above] to be placed under arrest for three
      days without trial; for persistent refusal to work they may, on the
      orders of the said officials, be transported under escort to
      their permanent place of residence," 

 

      After this, can the Provisional Regulations of September 15 be called
      anything but provisional penal servitude regulations? Punishment without
      trial, deportation under escort.... The ignorance and wretchedness of the
      Russian peasant is very great indeed, but there is a limit to
      everything. For this constant starvation and the steady banishment of
      workers from the towns to the country cannot but have their effect. And
      our government, which is so fond of governing by means of provisional

      regulations[5]

      will one day receive a very severe shock.
    

      The Provisional Regulations of September 15 must serve us as a means for
      wide agitation in workers’ study circles and among the peasantry; we
      must distribute copies of these regulations with leaflets explaining
      them; we must call meetings and read this law to the audience, explain its
      meaning in connection with the government’s “food” policy as a
      whole. We must see to it that every worker, who is in the least
      class-conscious and who goes to the village, shall thoroughly understand
      the meaning of the “provisional penal servitude regulations”
      and be able to explain to all whom he meets what the regulations are about
      and what must be done to gain deliverance from the penal servitude of
      starvation, tyranny, and lack of rights.
    

      Let these provisional regulations governing workers’ artels serve
      as a standing reproach and a serious warning to the soulful Russian
      intellectuals who advocate the establishment of various kinds of artels
      and similar legal societies permitted or encouraged by the
      government—a reproach for that naiveté with which they
      believed in the sincerity of the government’s permission or encouragement,
      without perceiving the base serf character that was concealed behind the
      signboard of “the furtherance of people’s labour”, etc. A
      warning—when they speak in the future of artels and other societies
      permitted by the Sipyagins, never to forget to tell the whole truth about
      the workers’ artels established

    

      in accordance with the provisional regulations of September 15, and if
      they dare not talk about such artels, to remain entirely silent.
    
 

Notes
 

[1]

The
      manner in which the Ministry decides this question can be judged from the
      example of Perm Gubernia. According to the latest press reports, this
      gubernia is still regarded as having “a good harvest”,
      notwithstanding the fact that (according to the report of the
      extraordinary gubernia Zemstvo congress held on October 10) the harvest
      this year is even worse than the extremely poor harvest of
      1898. The yield this year represents only 58 per cent of the average, and
      in the Shadrinsk and Irbit uyezds is only 36 per cent and 34 per cent
      respectively. In 1898 the government granted the gubernia (in addition to
      local grants) 1,500,000 poods of grain and over 250,000 rubles in
      money. Now, however, the Zemstvos have no funds, they are restricted in
      their powers, the harvest is far worse than that of 1898, the price of
      grain began to rise as from July 1, the peasants have begun
      selling their cattle—and the government persists in declaring
      that the gubernia has “a good harvest”!!
    —Lenin

[2]

See,
      for instance, the secret circular published in Iskra, No. 6, on
      the people banished from St. Petersburg, mostly writers, many of whom had
      never been involved in political affairs of any kind, let alone
      “labour” affairs. Nevertheless, they have been denied
      domicile, not only in university cities, but also in “factory
      localities”, while for some the prohibition relates only to
      factory localities.
    —Lenin

[3]

See,
      for example, the correspondence in Iskra, Nos. 6 and 7, in which
      it is reported that public unrest and aid to the peasants in despite of
      the government had penetrated even into such God-guarded cities as Penza,
      Simferopol, Kursk, etc.
    —Lenin

[4]

      Another Instance of the manner in which the Governor of Vyatka combats
      exaggerations:
    

      “In an ’announcement’ sent out to the Volost Boards the Governor of
      Vyatka records a very cautious attitude on the part of the peasants
      towards food grants from the government and the Zemstvo. ’During my tour
      of the gubernia,’ writes Mr. Klingenberg, ’I saw for myself with what
      deliberation and caution the peasants act in the present
      circumstances. They hesitate to contract debts except under pressure of
      extreme necessity and are firmly resolved to wait patiently or God’s help
      in the year to come, striving by their own efforts to extricate themselves
      from their difficult condition.’ Hence, the Governor of Vyatka expresses
      the conviction that ’the peaceful and sensible inhabitants of Vyatka
      Gubernia will not allow themselves to be disturbed by rumours about free
      government and Zemstvo aid and about the annulment of debts and arrears,
      or by exaggerated re ports of the failure of the harvest’. The Governor
      deems it his duty to warn the peasants that ’if a check of the grants
      shows that householders, even with no reserve stocks, have gathered in
      sufficient corn this year to feed themselves and their families and to sow
      their fields, but have sold their corn and utilised the proceeds for other
      purposes, such householders must not count on obtaining a loan. According
      to the new law, the loans granted will be recoverable, not on the basis of
      collective

      liability,[11]

      but in accordance with the regulations governing the collection of
      taxes. Consequently, every householder who applies for and receives a loan
      must bear in mind that he and he alone will be responsible for repayment,
      that no one will help him, that repayment will be strictly enforced, and
      that if he falls into arrears all his movable property may be sold and his
      real estate confiscated.’"
    
      We can well imagine how the local volost authorities treat starving
      peasants who have fallen into arrears and demand a loan after such a
      statement by the Governor!
    —Lenin

It
      is an old adage that any fool can govern under a state of siege. In
      Europe, it may be necessary to declare a state of siege from time to time,
      but in Russia a state of siege is always in force, supplemented, now here,
      now there, by provisional regulations. Are not all political affairs in
      Russia conducted according to provisional regulations?
    —Lenin

      first chapter of Lenin’s Review of Home Affairs was published as

Review of Home Affairs



    

    II. Attitude Towards the Crisis and the Famine

      While we are faced with a fresh outbreak of famine, the old and protracted
      commercial and industrial crisis, which still drags on, has thrown on to
      the streets tens of thousands of workers unable to find
      employment. Distress is very great among these workers, and all the more
      revealing is the fact that both the government and educated
      “society” adopt an attitude towards the distress of the
      workers that is entirely different from their attitude towards the
      distress of the peasants. The public institutions and the press make no
      effort to determine the number of workers in distress, or the degree of
      that distress, even to the extent to which this is done in the case of the
      peasants. No systematic measures are adopted to organise aid for the
      starving workers.
    

      Why this difference? It is, in our opinion, least of all because the
      distress among the workers is less apparent, or reveals itself in less
      acute forms. True, the city dwellers who do not belong to the working
      class know very little about the conditions of the factory workers, that
      they live now even more congested in cellars, attics, and hovels, that
      they are more undernourished than ever before and are pawning their last
      sticks and rags. True, the increasing number of tramps and beggars, who
      frequent doss-houses and fill the prisons and hospitals, do not attract
      any particular attention, because, well, “everyone” is
      accustomed to the idea that doss-houses and dens of hopeless wretchedness
      are always packed in large cities. True, unlike the peasants, unemployed
      workers are not tied down to a single place, and either of their own
      accord roam the country in quest of employment or are banished to
      “their native places” by authorities afraid of concentrations
      of large numbers of unemployed workers. Nevertheless, anyone who has any
      contact at all with industrial life knows from experience, and any one who
      interests himself in public affairs knows from the newspapers, that
      unemployment is steadily increasing.
    
 

      No, the reasons for this difference in attitude lie much deeper; they are
      to be sought in the fact that famine in the rural districts and
      unemployment in the towns belong to two altogether different types of
      economic life and are due to altogether different relations between the
      exploiting and the exploited classes. In the rural districts, the
      relations between these two classes are extremely confused and complicated
      by a multiplicity of transitional forms, as, for example, when farming is
      combined with usury, or with the exploitation of hired labour, etc.,
      etc. It is not the agricultural hired labourer—the antagonism of
      whose interests to the interests of the landlord and wealthy peasant is
      clearly apparent and is largely understood by the labourer
      himself—who is starving, but the small peasant, who is usually
      regarded (and regards himself) as an independent farmer, who only now and
      again falls accidentally into some “temporary” dependence. The
      immediate cause of the famine—the failure of the harvest—is
      spontaneous in the eyes of t.he masses, it is the will of God. And as poor
      harvests accompanied by famine have occurred from time immemorial,
      legislation has long been compelled to reckon with them. For years codes
      upon codes of laws have existed (principally on paper) providing for the
      distribution of food among the people and prescribing an involved system
      of “measures”. Although these measures, borrowed largely from
      the period of serfdom and the period of prevailing patriarchal,
      self-sufficing economy, correspond very little to the requirements of
      modern times, every famine sets in motion the whole government and Zemstvo
      administrative machine. And, however greatly the powers that he may desire
      it, this machine finds it difficult, almost impossible, to avoid resorting
      to all manner of aid from the hated “third persons”, the
      intellectuals, who are striving to “raise a clamour”. On the
      other hand, the connection of the famine with the poor harvest, together
      with the wretched state of the peasants, who do not understand (or but
      vaguely understand) that it is the increasing exploitation of capital in
      conjunction with the predatory policy of the government and of the
      landlords which has reduced them to this ruinous condition, has caused the
      famine-stricken to feel so absolutely helpless that, far from putting
      forward

    

      exacting demands, they put forward no “demands” at all.
    

      The less conscious the oppressed class is of its oppression and the less
      exacting it is in its demands upon its oppressors, the larger the number
      of individuals among the propertied classes who will be inclined towards
      philanthropy, and the less, relatively, will resistance be offered to this
      philanthropy by the local landlords, who are directly interested in
      keeping the peasants in a state of poverty. If this indisputable fact is
      borne in mind, it will be clear that the increased opposition of the
      landlords, the loud cries raised about the “demoralisation” of
      the peasants, and, finally, the purely military measures against the
      famine-stricken and against the benefactors, adopted by a government
      actuated by such a spirit, are symptoms of the complete decline and decay
      of that ancient, supposedly immutable and time-hallowed, patriarchal rural
      life over which the ardent Slavophils, the reactionaries most conscious of
      their aim, and the most naive of the old-fashioned Narodniks, wax so
      enthusiastic. The Narodniks have always accused us Social-Democrats of
      artificially applying the concept of the class struggle to conditions
      which do not admit of its application, while the reactionaries have always
      accused us of sowing class hatred and of inciting “one section of
      the population against another”. Without reiterating the answer to
      these charges, which has been given time and time again, we shall state
      merely that the Russian Government excels us all in the judgement
      of the profundity of the class struggle, and in the energetic force of the
      measures that must logically follow from such a judgement. Every one who
      has in one way or another come in contact with people who in famine years
      have gone to the village to “feed” the peasants—and who
      has not come in contact with them?—knows that they were prompted by
      pure sentiments of pity and humane sympathy, and that
      “political” plans of any kind were totally alien to them; that
      the propaganda of the ideas of the class struggle left such people cold,
      and that the arguments of the Marxists in heated battles against the views
      of the Narodniks on the village left them unconvinced. What has the class

    

      struggle to do with it? they said; the peasants are starving and we must
      help

      them —that 

      is all.
    

      But those who could not be convinced by the arguments of the Marxists may
      perhaps be convinced by the “arguments” of the Minister of the
      Interior. No, it is not simply that “the peasants are
      starving”, he warns the philanthropists, and they must not
      “simply” go to help the peasants without the permission of the
      authorities, for that spreads demoralisation and stimulates unjustifiable
      demands. To interfere in the food campaign means to interfere in the plans
      of God and the police to provide the landlords with workmen willing to
      work for next to nothing, and the Treasury with taxes collected by
      force. He who ponders over Sipyagin’s circular must say to
      himself—Yes, social war is going on in our countryside, and, as in
      all wars, the belligerents cannot be denied their right to inspect the
      cargoes of vessels sailing to enemy ports, even if the vessels sail under
      neutral flags. The only difference between this and other wars is that in
      this case one side, obliged perpetually to work and perpetually to starve,
      is not even fighting, it is only being fought—for the present.
    

      In factory industry, however, it has long been evident that this war is
      being carried on, and there is no need for government circulars to explain
      to the “neutral” philanthropists that it is unwise to ford the
      river without first sounding its depth (that is, without first obtaining
      the permission of the authorities and the factory owners). As early as
      1885, when there was as yet no noticeable socialist agitation amongst the
      workers, even in the central gubernias, where the workers are closer to
      the peasantry than are the workers in the capital, the industrial crisis
      caused the factory atmosphere to become so electrically charged that
      storms broke out continuously, now in one place and now in another. Under
      such circumstances, philanthropy is doomed to impotence from the outset
      and for that reason remains a casual and purely individual affair, without
      acquiring even a shadow of social significance.
    

      We shall note yet one other peculiar feature in the attitude of
      the public towards famines. It may be said without exaggeration that until
      very recently the opinion prevailed that the whole of the Russian
      economic, and even

    

      political, system rested upon the mass of independent land owning
      peasant farmers. The extent to which this opinion had penetrated the minds
      of even the most advanced thinking people, least susceptible to the wiles
      of official flattery, was strikingly illustrated by Nikolai —on in
      his work published after the famine of

      1891–92[2].

      The ruin of an enormous number of peasant farms seemed to every one to be
      so absurd, to be such an impossible leap into the void, that the necessity
      to extend the widest possible aid that would effectively “heal the
      wounds” was almost generally recognised. And again it was none other
      than Mr. Sipyagin who undertook the task of dispelling the last shreds of
      illusion. What does “Russia” rest upon, what do the landowners
      and the commercial and industrial classes live on, if not on the ruination
      and impoverishment of the people? To attempt to heal this
      “wound” otherwise than on paper—why, that would be a
      political crime!
    

      Mr. Sipyagin will, without doubt, contribute to the dissemination and the
      confirmation of the truth that there neither is nor can be any other means
      of combating unemployment and crises, as well as the Asiatic-barbarian and
      cruel forms the expropriation of the small producers has assumed in
      Russia, than the class struggle of the revolutionary proletariat against
      the entire capitalist system. The rulers of the capitalist state are no
      more concerned about the vast numbers of famine and crisis victims than a
      locomotive is concerned about those whom it crushes in its path. Dead
      bodies stop the wheels, the locomotive halts, it may (with a too energetic
      driver) jump the rails, but, in any case, after a delay, long or short, it
      will continue on its way. We hear of death from starvation, and of the
      ruin of tens and hundreds of thousands of small farmers, but, at the same
      time, we hear accounts of the progress of agriculture in our country, of
      the acquisition of foreign markets by the Russian landlords, who have sent
      an expedition of Russian farmers to England; we hear of increased sales of
      improved implements and of the extension of cultivated grass land,
      etc. For the masters of Russian agriculture (as well as for all capitalist
      masters), intensified ruination and starvation are nothing more than a
      slight and temporary hitch, to which they pay almost no attention
      whatever, unless

    

      compelled by the famine-stricken. Everything goes on as
      usual—even speculation in the sale of lands belonging to the section
      of the proprietors which consists of the well-to-do peasantry.
    

      Thus, Buguruslan Uyezd, Samara Gubernia, has been declared an
      “affected area”. This means that famine and the ruination of
      the mass of the peasantry have reached the highest point. But the
      misfortune of the masses does not hinder, but on the contrary appears to
      facilitate, the consolidation of the economic position of the bourgeois
      minority of the peasantry. In the September correspondence of Russkiye

Vedomosti[3]

(No. 244) we read the following concerning the uyezd referred to:
    

      “Buguruslan Uyezd, Samara Gubernia. The most important subject of
      discussion in this uyezd is the rapid rise in the price of land everywhere
      and the enormous speculation in land as a result. Only some fifteen or
      twenty years ago, excellent valley land could be bought at from ten to
      fifteen rubles per dessiatine. There were districts remote from the
      railway where, only three years ago, thirty-five rubles per dessiatine was
      regarded as a high price, and only on one occasion was as much as sixty
      rubles per dessiatine paid for first-rate land, with an excellent
      farm-house, situated near a market. Now, however, from fifty to sixty
      rubles per dessiatine is paid for the poorest land, while the price
      of good land has risen as high as eighty and even one hundred rubles per
      dessiatine. The speculation caused by this rise in land prices assumes two
      forms: First, the purchase of land for the purpose of immediate resale
      (there have been instances in which land was bought at forty rubles per
      dessiatine and resold within a year to the local peasants at
      fifty-five rubles). In such cases usually the land lords, not having
      either the time or the desire to bother with all the red tape and the
      formalities of selling the land to the peasants through the Peasant Bank,
      sell to the capitalist land speculators, who in their turn resell to
      the selfsame local peasants. In the second form, numerous land agents
      are engaged in foisting upon peasants from remote provinces (mostly from
      the Ukraine) all kinds of worthless land for which they obtain handsome
      commissions from the owners (from one to two rubles per
      dessiatine).

    

      From what has been said, it should be clear that the main victim of this
      land speculation is the peasant, whose land hunger serves as the
      basis for this unimaginable and, by economic causes unexplainable, jump in
      the price of land. Of course, the building of railways has had something
      to do with this, but not a great deal, for the principal buyer of land in
      our country remains the peasant, who by no means regards the railway as a
      factor of prime importance.”
    

      These tenacious “enterprising muzhiks”, who so greedily invest
      their “savings” (and their plunder) in the purchase of land,
      will inevitably cause the ruin of even those poor peasants who have still
      managed to survive the present famine.
    

      While bourgeois society resorts to land-purchasing schemes for the
      well-to-do peasant as a means of counteracting the ruination and
      starvation of the poor peasants, the search for new markets is resorted to
      as a means of counteracting crises and the glutting of the markets with
      the products of industry. The servile press (Novoye Vremya,
      No. 9188) waxes enthusiastic over the successes of the new trade with
      Persia and discusses glowingly the prospects of commerce with Central Asia
      and, particularly, with Manchuria. The iron magnates and other industrial
      leaders rub their hands in glee when they hear of proposals for further
      railway expansion. It has been decided to build the following major lines:
      St. Petersburg-Vyatka, Bologoye-Sedlets, Orenburg-Tashkent; the government
      has guaranteed a rail way loan of 37,000,000 rubles (to the Moscow-Kazan,
      Lodz, and South-Eastern Railway companies); and other lines are planned:
      Moscow-Kyshtym, Kamyshin-Astrakhan and Black Sea lines. The starving
      peasants and unemployed workers may console themselves with the thought
      that the state money (if the state can raise it) will not, of course, be
      spent “unproductively” on famine relief (see Sipyagin’s
      circular), but will be poured into the pockets of engineers and
      contractors, like those virtuosi in the art of embezzlement who year by
      year stole large sums during the construction of the Sormovo Dam, and who
      were only recently convicted (by way of exception) by the Moscow

      Assizes[4]

      in

      Nizhni-Novgorod.[1]
   

    
    

     

Notes
 

[1]

      Unfortunately, lack of space prevents us from dealing in de tail with this
      trial, which has demonstrated once again how the contractors

   

and engineers
      run the show. For us Russians this is an old story that is perennially
      new. Engineer Alexandrov, in company with Shnakenburg, head of the
      Nizhni-Novgorod branch of the Kazan region of the Ministry of Railways,
      and the six contractors who were brought to trial, during a period of
      three years (1893-95), had “built” for themselves and
      others thousands of rubles by presenting to the Treasury accounts,
      certificates, vouchers, etc., etc., for work never done and for supplies
      never delivered. Not only the jobs, but even the contractors, were
      fictitious; an ordinary clerk signed as a contractor! The amounts this
      fraternity pocketed can be seen from the following:
      Engineer Alexandrov submitted bills (from the “contractors”
      who found themselves in the dock) for a sum of over 200,000
      rubles; in these accounts, for example, the sum of 4,400 rubles appeared
      instead of the actually expended sum of 400 rubles. According to the
      evidence of one of the witnesses, Engineer Alexandrov squandered large
      sums of money either on women or on his immediate superiors, the railway
      engineers, spending as much as from fifty to eighty rubles for a single
      dinner.
    

      Most interesting of all, however, is the manner in which this case was handled
      and how it ended. The chief of police, to whom a detective reported the matter,
      “refused to take it up” (I). “This is not

   

      our affair,” he said, “it is the business of the Ministry of
      Railways,” and the detective had to appeal to the public prosecutor. In
      the end the whole thing came to light because the thieves fell out:
      Alexandroy “refused to split” with one of the
      clerk-contractors. The case dragged on for six years. Some of the
      witnesses died in the meantime, and many of them managed to forget the
      most important points in the case. A material witness like Lokhtin,
      ex-chief of the Kazan region of the Ministry of Railways, could not be
      found (sic!): according to one version he was in Kazan, according to
      another in Yeniseisk on business! This is not a joke, reader—it is
      taken from the trial record.
    

      The fact that others were implicated, in addition to those brought to
      trial, is apparent from the following: First, the commendable detective
      who brought the case to light is no longer in the service; he has
      purchased a tenement house, and is now living on the in come from
      it. Secondly, Engineer Makarov, chief of the Kazan Region of the
      Ministry of Railways (who during the construction of the Sormovo Dam
      acted as assistant chief), tried his utmost at the trial to shield
      Alexandrov. He even declared—literally!—that “ii was
      perfectly in order” for the dam to have been washed away in the
      spring of 1894. When he examined Alexandrov’s books, he found everything
      in perfect order: Alexandrov was distinguished for his experience, zeal,
      and accuracy!
    

      The result: Alexandrov—one year’s confinement in a fortress;
      Shnakenburg—a severe reprimand (from which he was absolved by the
      Manifesto of 1896!). The rest were acquitted. The Treasury’s claim was
      disallowed. One can imagine how pleased the unlocated Lokhtins and the
      Makarovs still in the service must be.

    III. The Third Element

      The term “third element” or “third persons” was
      employed, if we are not mistaken, by the Vice-Governor of Samara,
      Mr. Kondoidi, in his speech at the opening of the Samara Gubernia Zemstvo
      Assembly in 1900, to designate persons “belonging neither to the
      administration nor to the representatives of the
      social-estates”. The increase in the numbers and in the influence of
      such persons serving in the Zemstvo as doctors, technicians,
      statisticians, agronomists, teachers, etc., has long since attracted the
      attention of our reactionaries, who have also described these hated
      “third persons” as the “Zemstvo bureaucracy”.
    

      Generally speaking, it must be said that our reactionaries (including, of
      course, the entire top bureaucracy) reveal a fine political instinct. They
      are so well-experienced in combating oppositions, popular
      “revolts”, religious sects, rebellions, and revolutionaries,
      that they are always on the qui vive and understand far better
      than naive simpletons and “honest fogies” that the autocracy
      can never reconcile itself to self-reliance, honesty, independent
      convictions, and pride in real knowledge of any kind whatsoever.
      So thoroughly imbued are they with the spirit of subservience and red tape

    

      that prevails in the hierarchy of Russian officialdom that they have
      contempt for any one who is unlike Gogol’s Akaky

      Akakiyevich,[3]

      or, to use a more contemporary simile, the Man in a

Case[4].
    

      Indeed, if men in public office are to be judged, not by the positions
      they hold, but by their knowledge and their merits, will it not logically
      and inevitably lead to the creation of freedom of public opinion and
      public control to judge such knowledge and such merits? Will it not
      undermine the privileges of estate and rank upon which alone the Russian
      autocracy rests? Let us but listen to the arguments Kondoidi advances to
      justify his displeasure:
    

      “Representatives of the social-estates, sometimes without adequately
      proven grounds, give ear to the words of intellectuals, even if the latter
      are nothing more than salaried civil servants, merely because they talk
      about science or quote something they have learned from newspaper or
      magazine writers”. Well, well! Mere “salaried civil
      servants” daring to teach “representatives of the
      social—estates”! In

    

      passing, it should be said that the Zemstvo councillors, to whom the
      Vice-Governor referred, are members of a non-estate institution; but
      since every institution in our country is thoroughly saturated with the
      social-estate spirit, and since the Zemstvos, too, have lost the greater
      part of their non-estate character in consequence of the new regulations,
      it can be said, for the sake of brevity, that in Russia there are two
      governing “classes”: (1) the administration, and (2) the
      representatives of the social-estates. There is no room for a third
      element in a monarchy resting on the social-estates. And if unsubmissive
      economic development persistently undermines the foundations of the
      estates by the very growth of capitalism and gives rise to the need for
      “intellectuals”, who are becoming increasingly numerous, then
      it must be expected that the third element will strive to break out of its
      narrow confines.
    

      “The dreams of those belonging, neither to the administration nor to
      the representatives of the social-estates in the Zemstvo,” said
      Mr. Kondoidi, “are pure fantasy, but if these dreams have as their
      basis political tendencies, they may be harmful.”
    

      To admit the possibility of “political tendencies” is merely a
      diplomatic way of admitting their existence. The “dreams”
      referred to here are, if you will, all assumptions that for the doctor
      stem from the interests of the medical profession and for the
      statistician, from the interests of statistics, and that do not take into
      consideration the interests of the governing estates. In themselves, these
      dreams are fantasy, but, if you please, they foster political discontent.
    

      We shall now relate the attempt of another administrator, the head of one
      of the central gubernias, to advance a different argument for displeasure
      with the third element. According to this official, the activities of the
      Zemstvo in the gubernia in his charge “are year by year
      departing from the principles upon which the Ordinance on Zemstvo

      Institutions[5]

      is based”. According to these regulations
      the local inhabitants are empowered to manage affairs dealing with local
      needs and requirements. Owing to the indifference which the majority of
      landowners display towards the right granted them, “the Zemstvo
      Assemblies have become a mere formality and affairs are conducted
      by the Zemstvo Boards,

    

      the character of which leaves much to be desired”. This “has
      led to a big increase in the staffs of many Boards and to the practice of
      enlisting in the Zemstvo the services of experts—
      statisticians, agronomists, teachers, sanitary inspectors, etc., who,
      conscious of their educational, and sometimes intellectual,
      superiority over the members of the Zemstvo, have begun to display
      increasing independence, which, in particular, is achieved by
      convening all kinds of congresses in the gubernia and by setting
      up all kinds of councils in the Boards. As a result, the whole of the
      Zemstvo administration has fallen into the hands of persons who have
      nothing in common with the local population.” Although “there
      are among these persons many who are well-intentioned and are worthy of
      the utmost respect, they cannot regard their services as anything else
      than a means of livelihood, and they are interested in local needs and
      requirements only to the extent that their personal welfare depends upon
      these”.
    

      In the opinion of the governor, “in Zemstvo affairs, the hired
man cannot take the place of the property-owner”. This
argument may be described as more cunning or more candid than the one
mentioned above, depending on how one looks at it. It is more cunning
because it makes no mention of political tendencies, but tries to base
its reasoning exclusively on the interests of local needs and
requirements. It is more candid because it openly contrasts the
“hired man” to the property-owner. This is the
      time-honoured point of view of the Russian Kit

      Kitych,[6]

      who, in hiring a “mere teacher”, is guided principally by the
      market price of this particular form of professional service. The real
      master of everything is the property-owner, proclaims the representative
      of the camp from which praises are constantly heard of Russia and its
      strong and absolutely independent authority which is above all the classes
      and which, thank God, is free from the domination of selfish interests
      over public life that prevails in Western countries corrupted by
      parliamentarianism. And since the property-owner is the master, he must be
      master also of medical, statistical, and educational “affairs our
      Jack-in-office does not hesitate to draw this conclusion, which is the
      open recognition of the political leadership of the propertied
      classes. What is more curious, he does not hesitate to admit that these
      “experts” are conscious of their

    

      educational, and sometimes intellectual, superiority over the members of
      the Zemstvo. Of course, what other measures can be taken against
      intellectual superiority than measures of severity?...
    

      Recently, our reactionary press was presented with an excellent
      opportunity to repeat the demand for these measures of severity. The
      refusal of the intellectuals to be treated as ordinary hired men, as
      sellers of labour-power (rather than as citizens fulfilling definite
      public functions), has led from time to time to conflicts between the
      bigwigs of the Zemstvo Boards and the doctors who would resign in a body,
      or to conflicts with the technicians, etc. Recently the struggles between
      the Boards and the statisticians have assumed an outright epidemic
      character.
    

      In the May issue of Iskra (No. 4), it was reported that the local
      authorities in Yaroslavl had long been dissatisfied with their
      statisticians and, after the events in St. Petersburg in March, made a
      thorough “cleansing” of the statistical bureau, with
      instructions to the manager “in the future to engage students with
      extreme caution and with an assurance of their reliability beyond the
      shadow of a doubt”. An article, entitled “Sedition in
      Vladimir-on-Klyazma” (Iskra for June, No. 5), described the
      general condition of the suspected statisticians, and the reasons for the
      dislike exhibited towards them by the Governor, the manufacturers, and the
      landlords. The dismissal of the Vladimir statisticians for having
      telegraphed a message of sympathy to Annensky (who had been assaulted on
      Kazan Square on March 4) led practically to the closing-down of the
      statistical bureau, and as statisticians from other towns refused to serve
      in a Zemstvo that was unable to protect the interests of its employees,
      the local gendarmerie was obliged to act as mediator between the dismissed
      statisticians and the governor. “A gendarme visited several of the
      statisticians at their homes and suggested to them that they submit a
      request for reinstatement”; but his mission was a complete
      failure. Finally, the August issue of Iskra (No. 7) reported an
      “incident in the Yekaterinoslav Zemstvo” in which
      “pasha” Rodzyanko (chairman of the Gubernia Zemstvo Board) had
      dismissed statisticians for failing to carry out the “order”
      to keep a diary, which action led to the resignation of all the other
      members of the bureau,

    

      as well as to letters of protest from the Kharkov statisticians (published
      in the same issue of Iskra). Complications then began to set
      in. The Kharkov pasha, Mr. Gordeyenko (also chairman of the gubernia
      Zemstvo Board), intervened and declared to the statisticians of
      “his” Zemstvo that he “will not tolerate within the walls of
      the Board any meetings of employees called to discuss questions that do
      not concern their duties”. The Kharkov statisticians had barely
      carried out their intention of demanding the dismissal of the spy in their
      midst (Antonovich), when the administration dismissed the manager of the
      statistical bureau, which again led to the resignation of all the
      statisticians.
    

      The excitement caused by these events among the mass of Zemstvo
      statistical department employees can be judged by the letter written by
      the Vyatka statisticians, who sought to give a detailed reason for
      refusing to join the movement, for which they were justly described in
      Iskra (No. 9) as the “Vyatka strike-breakers”.
    

Iskra, of course, reported only some of the conflicts, by far not
      all, that took place; the legal press reported such conflicts also in the
      gubernias of St. Petersburg, Olonets, Nizhni-Novgorod, Taurida, and Samara
      (we include in the category of conflicts cases in which a number of
      statisticians are dismissed simultaneously, since such cases roused
      considerable discontent and ferment). The lengths to which the suspicious
      and shameless provincial authorities went can be judged from the
      following:
    

      “S. M. Bleklov, manager of the Taurida Bureau, in his
      ’Report on the Investigation of Dnieper Uyezd During May and June 1901’,
      which he submitted to the Board, relates that, work in the uyezd was
      carried on under hitherto unprecedented conditions. Although the
      statisticians had the governor’s consent to the undertaking of their
      duties, were furnished with the necessary documents, and in accordance
      with the orders of the gubernia officials were entitled to the assistance
      of the local authorities, they were nonetheless surrounded with
      extreme suspicion on the part of the uyezd police, who dogged
      their steps and expressed their distrust of them in the rudest
      manner, so much so that, as one peasant related, a policeman rode
      behind the statisticians and questioned the peasants as to whether ’the
      statisticians were not

    

      carrying on the propaganda of harmful ideas against the state and the
      fatherland’. According to Mr. Bleklov, the statisticians ’encountered
      various obstacles and difficulties which not only hindered their work, but
      deeply outraged their sense of personal dignity.... Frequently,
      the statisticians found themselves in the position of persons charged
      with a crime, concerning whom secret investigations were
      being made, which were known, by the by, to everybody—persons
      against whom it was considered necessary to warn all and sundry. The
      unbearable moral depression which they frequently suffered can therefore
      be well understood.’"
    
      Not a bad illustration for the record of the Zemstvo-versus-statistician
      conflicts and for the description of the surveillance over the
      “third element” in general!
    

      Small wonder that the reactionary press rushed in to attack the new
      “rebels”. Moskovskiye Vedomosti published a
      thunderous leading article, entitled “The Strike of the Zemstvo
      Statisticians” (September 24, No. 263), and a special article by
      N. A. Znamensky, entitled “The Third Element” (October 10,
      No. 279). “The third element is rearing its head too high,” writes
      the paper; it is resorting to “systematic opposition and
      strikes”, in order to resist the attempts to introduce
      “necessary discipline in the service”. The blame for all this
      rests upon the Zemstvo liberals, who have demoralised the employees.
    

      “There is not the slightest doubt that measures have been taken to
      introduce a degree of order in statistics and in the work of assessing by
      the more sober and sensible of the Zemstvo leaders, who refused to permit
      the Boards in their charge to be demoralised by anyone, even
      under the flag of liberal opposition. The opposition and the
      strikes should at last open their eyes to the character of the people
      they have to deal with in the persons of the intellectual
      proletarians, roaming as they did from one gubernia to another,
      engaging, who knows, in statistical investigations, or in educating
      the local adolescents in the Social-Democratic spirit.
    

      “At all events, the ’Zemstvo-versus-statistician conflicts’ will
      bring home a useful lesson to the more sensible section of the Zemstvo
      people. We think they will now see clearly that in the person of the
      ’third element’ they

    

      have nurtured a viper in the bosom of the Zemstvo

      institutions.”[1]


      We, too, have no doubt that the howling and whining of the faithful
      watchdog of the autocracy (the appellation, as is known, which Katkov, who
      for so long succeeded in keeping Moskovskiye Vedomosti charged
      with his spirit, assumed for himself) will “open the eyes” of
      many who do not yet fully understand how irreconcilable autocracy is to
      the interests of social development, to the interests of the
      intelligentsia generally, and to the interests of every genuine public
      cause which does not stand for embezzling state funds and for treachery.
    

      This little picture of the anti-“third element” crusade and the
      “Zemstvo-versus-statistician conflicts” should teach us
      Social-Democrats an important lesson. It must strengthen our faith in the
      might of the labour movement we lead; for we see that unrest in the
      foremost revolutionary class is spreading to other classes and other
      strata of society, that it has already led, not only to the rousing of the
      revolutionary spirit among the students to a degree hitherto

      unparalleled,[2]

      but to the beginning of the awakening of the countryside, to greater
      self-confidence and readiness to struggle on the part of social groups
      that have until now (as groups) not been very responsive.
    

      Public unrest is growing among the entire people in Russia, among all
      classes, and it is our duty as revolutionary Social-Democrats to exert
      every effort to take advantage of this development, in order to explain to
      the progressive working-class intellectuals what an ally they have in the
      peasants, in the students, and in the intellectuals generally, and to
      teach them how to take advantage of the flashes of social protest that
      break out, now in one place, now in another. We shall be able to assume
      our role of front-rank fighters

    

      for freedom only when the working class, led by a militant revolutionary
      party, while never for a moment forgetting its special condition in modern
      society and its specific historic task of liberating humanity from
      economic enslavement, will raise the banner in the struggle for
      freedom for the whole people and will rally to this banner all
      those of the most varied social strata whom the Sipyagins, Kondoidis, and
      the rest of the gang are so wilfully forcing into the ranks of the
      discontented.
    

      What is necessary now in order to achieve this is that we infuse into our
      movement, not only the consistent revolutionary theory elaborated in the
      course of a century-long development, of European thought, but also the
      revolutionary energy and revolutionary experience bequeathed to us by our
      West-European and Russian precursors, and that we do not fall into slavish
      adoption of the opportunism in its various forms from which our Western
      comrades —who have not been affected by it to such an
      extent—are turning away, but which is such a strong hindrance to us
      in our march to victory.
    

      The Russian proletariat, at the present time, is confront ed by the most
      difficult, but extremely gratifying, task: to crush the enemy, whom the
      long-suffering Russian intelligentsia has been unable to overcome, and to
      assume its place in the ranks of the international army of socialism.

As
      these lines are written, news comes of fresh and greater unrest among the
      students, ’of meetings in Kiev, St. Petersburg, and other cities, of the
      formation of revolutionary students’ groups in Odessa, etc. Perhaps
      history will impose upon the students the role of initiators in the
      decisive struggle. Be that as it may, if victory is to he achieved in this
      struggle, the masses of the proletariat must be roused and we must
      accelerate our efforts to make them class-conscious, to inspire and
      organise them.

    IV. Two Speeches By Marshals of the Nobility

      “It is a sadly significant fact, entirely without precedent; and many
      unexampled misfortunes are held in store for Russia by such facts, which
      are possible only because of our far-advanced social
      demoralisation...." Thus wrote Moskovskiye Vedomosti, in
      the leading article of No. 268 (September 29), commenting on a speech
      delivered by M. A. Stakhovich, Marshal of the Nobility of Orel Gubernia,
      at a missionary congress held in that gubernia (the congress closed on
      September 24).... Well, if “social demoralisation” has
      affected the marshals of the nobility, the foremost men in the uyezd and
      the second in importance in the gubernia, where indeed must we seek for
      the end of this “pestilential, spiritual canker that has seized upon
      Russia”?
    
 

      What is the issue? The issue is that this Mr. Stakhovich (the very
      gentleman who wished to find posts for the Orel nobility as liquor excise
      collectors; see “Casual Notes”, Zarya,
No. 1[1]

)

      delivered a fiery speech in defence of freedom of conscience and was
      “tactless, not to say cynical, enough to suggest the

      following”:[2]


      “It is the duty of the missionary congress more than of any
other body in Russia to proclaim the necessity of freedom of
conscience, the necessity to abolish all penalties for seceding
from the Orthodox Church and accepting another faith. And I would
suggest that the Orel missionary congress openly express itself in this
sense and present such a petition in suitable manner....
    

      Of course, Moskovskiye Vedomosti was naive enough to picture
      Mr. Stakhovich as a Robespierre (“that oh, so gay M. A. Stakhovich,
      whom I have long known, a Robespierre!” wrote Mr. Suvorin in Novoye
      Vremya, and it was difficult to read his speech “for the
      defence” without smiling), as it was naive of Mr. Stakhovich to
      suggest to the priests that they petition “in suitable manner”
      for freedom of conscience. It was like suggesting to a congress of police
      officers that they petition for political freedom!
    

      There is hardly need to add that “the convocation of the clergy,
      presided over by the highest priest”, rejected

    

      Mr. Stakhovich’s suggestion “both on account of the contents of the
      speech and of its non-accordance with the tasks of the local missionary
      congress”, after hearing the “weighty objections” of His
      Grace, the Bishop Nikanor of Orel; of N. I. Ivanovsky, Professor of the
      Kazan Academy of Divinity; of V. M. Skvortsov, editor and publisher of the
      periodical Missionerskoye

Obozreniye[6];

      of V. A. Ternavtsev and M. A. Novosyolov, members of the university staff;
      and of several missionary priests. One might say: An alliance of
      “science” and the church!
    

      Of course, Mr. Stakhovich interests us, not as a model of clear and
      consistent political thinking, but as a model of the most “oh, so
      gay” Russian nobleman, who is always ready to grab a slice of the
      state pie. And one can imagine to what extent “demoralisation”
      has penetrated Russian life generally and the life of our rural districts
      in particular as a result of police tyranny and the inquisitorial
      persecution of religious sects, if the very stones cry out, if even
      marshals of the nobility have begun to talk strongly about freedom of
      conscience.
    

      The following instances from Mr. Stakhovich’s speech give a striking
      picture of the outrageous state of affairs that rouses even the most
      “oh, so gay” to indignation:
    

      “Go to the library of the missionary brotherhood, and take down the
      handbook of laws. There you will read in Article 783, Volume II, Part I,
      that it is the duty of the rural chief of police, in addition to
      preventing duelling, lampooning, drunkenness, hunting in the close season,
      and men and women washing together in public baths, to keep observation
      over the arguments directed against the dogmas of the Orthodox Church and
      to prevent the ’seduction of the orthodox to other faiths and schisms!"
      Yes! There is actually such an article in the Act, and it imposes many
      more such functions upon the rural police chief besides those enumerated
      by the speaker. The majority of city dwellers would look upon this article
      as a curiosity, as, indeed, Mr. Stakhovich designated it; but for the
      peasant this curiosity conceals a bitterer Ernst, the bitter
      truth about the outrages committed by the lower ranks of the police, who
      are only too firmly convinced that God is very high up and the tsar very
      far off.
    
 

      And now some concrete instances that we shall cite together with the
      official denial made by the President of the Council of the Orel Orthodox
      Brotherhood of Peter and Paul and of the Orel Diocesan Missionary
      Congress, Archpriest Peter Rozhdestvensky (Moskovskiye Vedomosti,
      No. 269, reprinted from Orlovsky

Vestnik,[7]

      No. 257):
    

      “(a) In the speech [by Mr. Stakhovich] reference is made to a village
      in Trubchevsk Uyezd:
    

“’With the knowledge and consent of the priest and of the officials,
the suspected

Stundists[8]
were locked in the church, a table was brought, a white cloth
      was spread over it, an icon was upon it, and each was led separately to
      the table and commanded to kiss the icon.
    

      “’“I refuse to kiss idols.”
    

      “’“So! Flog him on the spot!”
    

      “’The weaker ones returned to the orthodox faith after the first
      flogging. But there were some who were flogged four times.’
    

      “According to the official data presented in the report of the Orel
      Orthodox Brotherhood of Peter and Paul, published as far back as 1896, and
      according to the verbal information given at the congress by Father
      D. Pereverzev, the described acts of violence inflicted by the orthodox
      population upon the sectarians of the village of Lyubets in Trubchevsk
      Uyezd took place following a decision adopted at the village meeting
      and somewhere in the village, but certainly not with the consent of the
      local priest and on no account in the church; this regret table
      incident took place eighteen or nineteen years ago, long before
      the Orel Diocesan Mission was even thought of.”
    

      Commenting on the above, Moskovskiye Vedomosti states that
      Mr. Stakhovich cited only two facts in his speech. Perhaps
      so. But what facts they were! The refutation based on “official
      data” (of the rural police) and on the report of the Orthodox
      Brotherhood but emphasises the shocking character of the outrages
      which roused the indignation of even an “oh, so gay”
      nobleman. Whether the flogging took place “somewhere in the
      village” or in the church, six months or eighteen years ago, does
      not alter the case in the least (except perhaps in the one respect that,
      by general knowledge, the persecution of sects has become even more brutal
      of late and that the establishment of missions is directly

    

      related to this fact). As to the local priest’s having had nothing to
do with the inquisitors in rustic

garb[3]

—better

had you kept quiet about it in the press, Reverend Father;
      you will only be a laughing-stock. Of course, the “local
      priest” did not give his “consent” to torture, a
      punishable act under the Criminal Code, any more than the Holy Inquisition
      punished its victims with its own hands. It handed them over to the
      secular authorities; nor did it ever shed blood, it only had its victims
      burned.
    

      The second fact:
    

      “(b) It was stated in the speech:
    

      “’In that case the priest will never again be able to give the answer
      we heard him give here: “You say, Father, there were forty
      families and now there are only four. What has be come of the rest?”
    

      “’“By the grace of God they have been banished to
Transcaucasia and to Siberia.’"
    
      “Actually, in the village of Glybochka, Trubchevsk Uyezd, which is
      the village concerned in this case, there were in 1898, according
      to the report of the Brotherhood, not forty Stundist
      families, but forty persons of both sexes, including twenty-one
      children. In that year only seven persons were banished to Transcaucasia
      by order of the regional court as a penalty for proselytising to the
      Stundist faith. As for the expression of the local priest, ’banished
      by the grace of God’, it was a casual remark dropped at a closed session
      of the congress during a free exchange of opinion among the
      delegates, the more so, since the priest in question was previously
      known to every one, and at the congress proved himself to be a most
      worthy missionary priest.”
    

      Such a refutation is truly priceless! Casually dropped during a free
      exchange of opinion! This is precisely what makes it interesting, for we
      know only too well the real value of the official utterances of official
      persons. And if the priest,

    

      who uttered these words “straight from the heart”, is “a
      most worthy missionary priest”, the more significant are these words
      for that very reason. “By the grace of God, banished to
      Transcaucasia and to Siberia.” These magnificent words should become no
      less famous than Metropolitan Philaret’s defence of serfdom with the help
      of Holy Writ.
    

      Since we have mentioned Philaret, it would be unfair not to mention the
      letter addressed by a “learned liberal” to His Grace
      Ambrosius, Archbishop of Kharkov, and published in the magazine Vera i

Razum[9]

      for

      1901.[4]

      The author of the letter signed himself: Jeronim Preobrazhensky, honorary
      citizen, formerly a member of the clergy. It was the editor who described
      him as the “learned [!] liberal”, no doubt because he was
      overawed by his “well of wisdom”. We shall cite only a few
      passages from the letter, which again reveals the fact that political
      thought and political protest penetrate by unseen ways into wider circles
      than we sometimes imagine.
    


“I am already an old man, nearly sixty. During my lifetime I have
      observed not a few departures from the fulfilment of church duties, and I
      must say conscientiously that in every case the clergy was to blame. As
      for ’the latest events’, I think we should fervently thank the
      clergy of our day for opening the eyes of many. Now, not only volost
      clerks, but young and old, educated and uneducated, and even those barely
      able to read will strive to read the writings of the great Russian
      author. People pay high price s to get his books (published abroad by
      Svobodnoye

      Slovo,[10]

      and freely obtainable in all countries of the world except Russia); they
      read them, discuss them, and finally come to conclusions that are, of
      course, not favourable to the clergy. The people are now beginning to
      understand where truth and where falsehood lies; they see that the clergy
      say one thing and do another, and that often even their words are
      contradictory. Much that is true might be said, but unfortunately one
      cannot speak frankly with the clergy; they would immediately report to the
      authorities and demand punishment and execution.:.. But Christ did not
      attract converts by force and by executions, but by justice and love....
    

      “... In concluding your speech, you write: ’We possess a great force for
      the struggle—that is the autocratic power of our most devout
      sovereigns.’  Again a subterfuge, and again we refuse to believe
      you. Although you, the enlightened clergy, strive to assure us
      that you

    

      ’imbibed loyalty to the autocrat with your mother’s milk’ (from the speech
      of the present vicar, delivered at the time of his consecration as
      bishop), we, the unenlightened, refuse to believe that a year-old
      infant (even a future bishop) could reason about the form of government
      and give preference to autocracy. After the abortive attempt of Patriarch
      Nikon to play in Russia the role of the Popes of Rome, who in Western
      countries combined within themselves spiritual and temporal power, our
      church, through its highest representatives, the metropolitans, has wholly
      and for ever subjected itself to the power of the sovereigns, who
      sometimes, as was the case with Peter the Great, despotically imposed
      their will upon the church. (The pressure Peter the Great brought to bear
      upon the clergy in the condemnation of Tsarevich Alexei.) In the
      nineteenth century, we see complete harmony between the secular and
      ecclesiastical authorities in Russia. In the stern epoch of Nicholas I,
      when, influenced by the great social movements in the West, social
      consciousness began to awaken in Russia and here, too, individual
      champions arose to fight against the outrageous enslavement of the common
      people, our church remained completely indifferent to the popular
      sufferings, and despite Christ’s great commandment of human brotherhood
      and brotherly love, not a single voice was raised among the clergy in
      defence of the dispossessed people, against the cruel tyranny of the
      landlords; and the only reason for this was that the government did not
      yet dare to lay its hand upon serfdom, the existence of which Philaret of
      Moscow openly sought to justify with biblical texts from the Old
      Testament. Then came the storm: Russia was defeated and politically
      degraded at Sevastopol. The defeat clearly exposed all the defects of our

      pre-Reform[5]

      system, and before all else our young, humane sovereign (who
      owes the education of his mind and spirit to the poet Zhukovsky) broke the
      ancient chains of slavery; but, by the irony of fate, the text of the
      great act of February 19 was submitted for revision from the Christian
      point of view to the selfsame Philaret, who apparently hastened to change
      his views regarding serfdom to suit the spirit of our times. The epoch of
      the great reforms left its mark also upon our clergy, which, under
      Makarius (afterwards Metropolitan) carried on the fruitful work of
      reorganising our ecclesiastical institutions in which they hacked a window
      (even if a small one) into the world of light and publicity. The period of
      reaction, which set in after March 1, 1884, enabled an element of
      leadership corresponding to the manner of Pobedonostsev and Katkov to
      penetrate into the clergy; and while the progressive people of the country
      in the Zemstvos and in society are presenting petitions for the abolition
      of the survivals of corporal punishment, the church remains silent and
      utters not a word in condemnation of those who defend the rod—that
      atrocious instrument for the degradation of human beings created in the
      image of God. After all this, would it be unjust to suppose in the
      event of changes in the régime from above that our clergy,
      through its representatives, would praise a constitutional monarch just as
      it now lands the autocratic monarch? Why then the hypocrisy? Strength
      lies, not in the autocracy, but in

    

      the monarch. Peter I was also a heaven-sent autocrat, but the church to
      this day does not favour him, and Peter III was a similar autocrat who
      wanted to shear and educate our clergy—what a pity he was not
      allowed to reign for two or three years! And if the present reigning
      autocrat, Nicholas II, decided to express his kindly feelings for the
      famous Lev

      Nikolayevich, [Lev Tolstoi.—Tr.]

      where would you then run to hide with your snares, your fears, and your
      threats?
    

      “In vain you quote texts of the prayers which the clergy sends up for
      the tsar; this jumble of words in an incomprehensible jargon convinces no
      one. We live under an autocracy: if ordered to do so, you will write
      prayers thrice as long and even more expressive”.
    

 *     *  * 

      The second marshal’s speech, as far as we know, was not published in our
      press. A hectographed copy, sent to us by an unknown correspondent last
      August, bore the following pencilled inscription: “Speech delivered
      by an uyezd marshal of the nobility at a private meeting of marshals
      called to discuss student affairs." We give the speech in full:
    


      “For lack of time I shall express my views on this meeting of
      marshals of the nobility in the form of theses:
    

      “The cause of the present disorders is known approximately:

      They are called forth, first, by the disordered state of our entire govern
      mental system, by the oligarchic régime of the bureaucratic
      corporate body, i.e., by the dictatorship of the bureaucrats.
    

      “This state of disorder in the bureaucratic governmental dictator
      ship reveals itself throughout the whole of Russian society, from top to
      bottom, in the form of general discontent that finds its outward
      expression in the general politicalism, a politicalism that is not
      temporary or superficial, but profound and chronic.
    

      “This politicalism, the common disease of the whole of society,
      permeates all its manifestations, its functions and institutions, and for
      that reason necessarily the educational institutions, with their younger,
      more impressionable public, which is oppressed by the same régime
      of the bureaucratic dictatorship.
    

      “It is recognised that the root evil of student disorders lies in the
      general disorganisation of the state and in the general disease resulting
      from this condition; however, in view of the spontaneous sentiments and of
      the necessity for checking the development of the local evil, the
      disorders cannot be ignored and efforts must be made at least from this
      side to diminish the frightfully destructive manifestations of the general
      evil, in the same way as, when the whole organism is diseased and is in
      need of prolonged and radical treatment it is necessary to take urgent
      measures to suppress local, acute, and destructive complications of the
      disease.
    
 

      “In the secondary and higher educational establishments, the evil of
      the bureaucratic régime finds expression principally in the
      substitution of human (youthful) development and education by bureaucratic
      training, which is combined with the systematic suppression of human
      individuality and dignity.
    

      “The distrust, indignation, and anger against the officials and the
      teachers roused among the youth by all these manifestations are being
      transferred from the high schools to the universities, where,
      unfortunately, the universities being what they are at present, the youth
      encounters the same evils and the same suppression of human individuality
      and dignity.
    

      “In a word, for the youth, the universities are not temples of
      learning, but factories for converting the impersonal student masses into
      the bureaucratic commodity required by the state.
    

      “This suppression of human individuality (in the process of
      converting the students into an impersonal, pliable mass), which reveals
      itself in the form of a systematic and chronic suppression and persecution
      of all personality and dignity, frequently in the form of brutal violence,
      lies at the base of all student disorders that have erupted for several
      decades and threaten to continue with greater intensity in the future,
      carrying off the best of Russia’s youth.
    

      “All this we know—but what are we to do in the present
      situation? How can we help the present acute situation with all its
      bitterness, with all its misery and sorrow? Give up all efforts? Abandon
      our youth to the mercy of fate, to the bureaucrats, and to the police,
      without attempting to help them—wash our hands of the whole thing
      and walk off? This, to my mind, is the main issue, namely, what can we do
      to assuage the acute manifestation of this disease, now that we recognise
      its general character?
    

      “Our meeting reminds me of a crowd of well-intentioned people who
      have entered a wild forest for the purpose of clearing it, and who stand
      in utter amazement at the enormity of the general task, instead of
      concentrating on any one special point.
    

      “Professor K. T. has presented to us a striking general picture of
      the true state of affairs today in the universities and among the
      students, pointing Out the various harmful influences from the outside,
      not only political, but even police influences, upon the unstable
      students; but we knew all this before, more or less, albeit not so clearly
      as we know now.
    

      “He suggested a radical change in the whole of the educational system
      and its substitution by a better system as the only possible measure to
      adopt, but the professor remarked that this would probably require
      considerable time; and if we bear in mind that every particular system in
      the Russian state, as in every other state, forms an organic part of the
      system as a whole, then perhaps the end of that time is not foreseeable.
    

      “But what must we do now in order at least to assuage the unbearable
      pain caused by the disease at the present time? What palliative can we
      adopt? Even palliatives that temporarily soothe the patient are frequently
      recognised as necessary. This is a question we have not answered. Instead
      of a reply, we have heard vague, wavering opinions

    

      as regards the student youth in general, which, I might say, obscure the
      question even more. It is even difficult to recall those judgements, but I
      will endeavour to do so.
    

      “Something was said about girl students: We gave them courses and
      lectures, and see how they thank us—by taking part in student
      disorders!
    

      “Now, had we presented bouquets or costly ornaments to the fair sex,
      such a reproach would be conceivable; to organise lecture courses for
      women, however, is not a favour, but the satisfaction of a social
      need. Women’s lecture courses are nut a caprice, but as much a socially
      necessary educational institution as are the universities for the higher
      development of the youth of both sexes. That is why full social and
      comradely solidarity exists between the male and female educational
      institutions.
    

      “This solidarity, to my view, likewise fully explains the fact that
      the unrest among the student youth has also spread among the students in
      women’s educational institutions. All the students are in a state of
      unrest, irrespective of attire, male or female.
    

      “Someone else then spoke about the student unrest, saying that we
      must not be indulgent with the students, that their outrages must be
      halted by force. To this, in my opinion, the rational objection was made
      that even if the conduct of the students can be set down as outrageous,
      these are not fortuitous, but are chronic and deep-rooted and that
      therefore the resort to mere punitive measures, as past experience has
      shown, will prove unavailing. Personally, as I view the matter, it is
      highly questionable as to which side is responsible f or the greatest
      outrage of all the outrageous disorders that excite our educational
      institutions and are bringing them to their doom; I do not believe the
      government’s reports.
    

      “This is the very point, that the other side is not listened to and
      cannot be listened to; it is gagged (the justice of my words, that in its
      reports the administration lies and that by its atrocious conduct it is
      chiefly responsible for the outrages, has not been fully confirmed).
    

      “Reference was made to the outside influences of various
      revolutionary forces upon the student youth.
    

      “Yes, those influences exist, hut too much significance is attached
      to them. Thus, the factory owners, in whose factories these influences are
      mainly felt, also throw the blame for everything upon them, arguing that,
      were it not for those influences, there would be quiet and contentment and
      the peace of God in their factories; they forget or ignore all the legal
      and illegal exploitation of the workers, which brings about their
      impoverishment and rouses amongst them discontent and finally leads to
      disorders. Were it not for this exploitation, the revolutionary elements
      working from the outside would be deprived of the many grounds and causes
      that enable them to penetrate so easily into factory affairs. All this, in
      my opinion, may also be said with respect to our educational institutions,
      which have been transformed from temples of learning into factories for
      the manufacture of bureaucratic material.
    

      “The power of the small but purposive handful of young men and women, of
      whom the professor spoke, to hypnotise and incite crowds

    

      of young men and women, apparently not in the least so predisposed, to
      strikes and to disorders, lies in the general, instinctive consciousness
      of the oppression weighing over the whole of our student youth, and in the
      generally unhealthy state of mind that is created by this oppression among
      student youth at all levels. This is what happens in all factories.
    

      “I recall also that something was said about not flattering the
      students, about not showing them sympathy during disorders, since
      expressions of sympathy merely incite them to fresh outbreaks to
      illustrate which argument a number of varying instances were cited. On
      this point I would say, first of all, that in view of the manifold con
      fusion and the diversity of occurrences during disorders, it is impossible
      to point to single cases as illustrative of all, since, for every such
      case, numerous others of a directly contradictory character can be
      found. One can only dwell on the general indications, which I shall here
      briefly undertake to do.
    

      “As we all know, the students are far from being coddled; not only
      have they not been scented with incense (I do not speak of the forties),
      but they have never enjoyed any particular public sympathy. At the time of
      the disorders, the public was either indifferent to the students or even
      more than negative towards them, throwing the blame entirely upon them,
      without knowing (or desiring to know) the causes of the disorders
      (credence was given, without the slightest doubt as to their veracity, to
      the government reports, which were hostile to the students; apparently for
      the first time the public has begun to doubt them). To speak, therefore,
      of flattering the students is quite beside the mark.
    

      “Failing to find support among the intelligentsia in general or among
      the professors and the university officials, the students finally began to
      seek sympathy among the various popular elements, and we know that they
      succeeded more or less in finding it; they have begun gradually to gain
      the sympathy of the popular crowds.
    

      “To be convinced of this, one need only note the difference be tween the
      present attitude of the crowd and that displayed towards the students at the
      time of the Okhotny

      Ryad[11]

      assaults. Herein lies the great evil: the evil is not that sympathy is
      expressed, but that this sympathy is one-sided, that it is assuming a
      demagogic tinge.
    

      “The absence of sympathy and support of any kind on the part of the
      settled intelligentsia, and the distrust this gives rise to, throws our
      youth inevitably into the arms of demagogues and revolutionists; it
      becomes their tools and, again inevitably, demagogic elements begin more
      and more to develop among the student youth, drawing it away from
      peaceful, cultural development and from the existing order (if it can be
      called order) and driving it into the enemy camp.
    

      “We ourselves are to blame if our youth has ceased to have confidence
      in us; we have done nothing to deserve its confidence.
    

      “These, I think, are the main ideas that were expressed at this
      meeting; the others (considerable in number, too) are hardly worth
      recalling.
    

      “I come now to the conclusion. In gathering here, our intention was
      to do something to calm the passions of the present day, to lighten

    

      the heavy burden of our youth today, not some time in the future, and we
      were defeated. Again the youth will be justified in saying and will say
      that today as in the past the peaceful, settled Russian intelligentsia
      neither can nor wishes to render it any assistance, to come to its
      defence, to understand it and to ease its hitter lot. The gulf between
      ourselves and the youth will become wider, and the youth will increasingly
      join up with the various demagogues whose hand is outstretched towards it.
    

      “We were not defeated by the fact that the measure we proposed, a
      petition to the tsar, was not accepted; perhaps that measure was not a
      practical one (although in my opinion no attention was paid to it); we
      were defeated by the fact that we ourselves destroyed all possibility of
      applying any measure whatsoever to help our suffering youth; we have
      confessed our impotence, and once again we grope as before, in darkness.
    

      “What remains for us to do?
    

      “Wash our hands of the affair?
    

      “This darkness constitutes the terrible and gloomy tragedy of Russian
      life.”
    


      This speech requires no lengthy comment. It too, apparently, belongs to a
      still sufficiently “oh, so gay” Russian noble who; either for
      doctrinaire or for selfish motives, ex presses reverence for
      “peaceful, cultural development” of the “existing
      order” and waxes indignant with “revolutionists”, whom
      he confounds with “demagogues”. But this indignation, if
      examined closely, borders on the grumbling of an old man (old, not in age
      but in views) who perhaps is ready to recognise something good in the
      thing he is grumbling about. In speaking of the “existing
      order” he cannot refrain from remarking, “if it can be called
      order”. He smoulders with resentment against the disorder caused by
      the “dictatorship of the bureaucrats”, the “systematic
      and chronic persecution of all personality and dignity”; he cannot
      close his eyes to the fact that all the outrages are committed chiefly by
      the administration. He is sufficiently straightforward to confess his
      impotence and to recognise the indecency of “washing one’s
      hands” of the entire country’s misery. True, he is still frightened
      by the “one-sided” sympathy of the “crowd” towards
      the students. His aristocratically effeminated mind is haunted by the
      menace of “demagogy”, and perhaps even by the menace of
      socialism (let us repay candour with candour). But it would be absurd to
      attempt to test the views and sentiments of a marshal of the nobility who
      is fed up with the disgusting Russian bureaucracy by the

    

      touchstone of socialism. We have no need to be diplomatic either in regard
      to him or to anyone else; when we hear a Russian landlord, for example,
      storming against the illegal exploitation and the impoverishment of
      factory workers, we will not fail, incidentally, to say to him,
      Cast out the beam out of thine own eye, friend! We shall not for a moment
      conceal from him that we stand and will continue to stand for the
      irreconcilable class struggle against the “masters” of modern
      society. But a political alignment is determined, not only by ultimate
      aims, but also by immediate aims, not only by general views, but also by
      the pressure of direct practical necessity. Whoever clearly sees the
      contradiction between the “cultural development” of the
      country and the “oppressive regime of the bureaucratic
      dictatorship” must, sooner or later, be compelled by the very facts
      of life to come to the conclusion that this contradiction cannot be
      removed unless the autocracy is removed. Having come to this conclusion,
      he will unfailingly assist—grumble, but assist—the party that
      can rouse a menacing force against the autocracy—a force that will
      be menacing, not only in the eyes of the autocracy, but in the eyes of
      all. In order to become such a party, we repeat, Social-Democracy must
      purge itself of all opportunistic pollution, and under the banner of
      revolutionary theory, basing itself on the most revolutionary class, it
      must carry its agitation and organising activity among all classes of the
      population.
    

      Taking our leave of the marshals of the nobility, we say, Au
      revoir, gentlemen, our allies of tomorrow!

Moskovskiye Vedomosti, September 29, No. 268. I apologise to the
      reader for betraying such a predilection for Moskovskiye
      Vedomosti. But what can one do. In my opinion, it is the most
      interesting, the most consistent, and the most serviceable
      political newspaper in Russia. One can hardly term “political”
      literature, in the proper sense of the word, that which at best simply
      makes a selection of some interesting, though raw, facts and then offers
      sighs instead of “wisdom”. I do not say that such writing
      cannot be very useful, but it is not politics. Nor can the Novoye
      Vremya type of literature be described as political literature in the
      real sense of the word, notwithstanding (or rather because of) the fact
      that it is excessively political. It has no definite political programme
      and no convictions; it merely possesses the ability to adapt its tone to
      the moods of the moment, to cringe before the powers that be and carry out
      their every order, and to flirt with an illusion of public
      opinion. Moskovskiye Vedomosti, however, has its own line and
      does not fear (it has nothing to fear) to march ahead of the government,
      and to touch upon, at times very frankly, the most delicate subjects. It
      is a useful newspaper, and in dispensable helpmate in revolutionary
      agitation!

      that the civil authorities knew of the decision of the village meeting

      In Iskra, No. 9 (October

      1901),[1]

      we told of the unsuccessful attempt to unite the section of the
      Zarya-Iskra organisation abroad, the revolutionary organisation
      Sotsial-Demokrat and the Union of Russian Social-Democrats
      Abroad. We have decided to publish the proceedings of the
      “Unity” Conference, so that all Russian Social-Democrats may
      independently draw their own conclusions as to the reasons for the failure
      of the attempt at unity made by the organisations abroad. Unfortunately,
      the secretary of the Conference, elected by the Union Abroad, refused to
      assist in drawing up the minutes of the proceedings (as will be seen from
      his letter, quoted on pages 10 and 11 of this pamphlet, in reply to the
      invitation to him by the secretaries of the two other organisations).
    

      This refusal is all the more strange for the reason that the Union Abroad
      has published its own account of the “Unity” Conference
      (Two Conferences, Geneva, 1901). It would appear, therefore, that
      although the Union Abroad desired to inform the Russian comrades of the
      results of the Conference, it did not wish to acquaint them with
      the

      debates.[2]

      We leave

    

      it to the reader to draw his own conclusions as to the possible and
      probable reasons for this unwillingness.
    

      After the Union Abroad had rejected our proposal, we on our part did not
      think it desirable to publish a summary of the discussion that had not
      been drawn up jointly by all three secretaries; for this reason we are
      obliged to confine ourselves to the publication of all documents
      and declarations submitted to the bureau of the Conference. The
      bureau consisted of the chairmen and secretaries of all three
      organisations, and all declarations were submitted to the bureau
      exclusively in writing; thus there can be no doubt about the objectivity
      of a description of the Conference which is based on the documents and
      declarations.
    

      On the other hand, the publication of all the documents and
      declarations presented to the bureau is all the more necessary at the
      present time, since the Union Abroad has crowned its strange refusal to
      participate in drawing up the minutes of the Conference with a still
      stranger method of drawing up the Conference report. Thus, the Union
      Abroad has not reproduced in full the

      interpellations[3]

      submitted to the bureau of the Conference by the representative
      of Iskra

      (Frey[5])

      in the name of the Iskra section abroad, and of the
      Sotsial-Demokrat organisation; but it did reproduce the reply (to
      the interpellations) “drawn up” by the Union Abroad but not
      submitted to the bureau and not even read at the Conference (Two
      Conferences, p. 26). The Union Abroad is mistaken in stating that the
      “interpellation” was withdrawn. The interpellation consisted
      of the two questions submitted to the Union by Frey in the name of the two
      organisations (see p. 6 of this pamphlet). Neither of these
      questions was withdrawn; only the form was changed

    

      to turn the questions into a resolution which might have been submitted to
      a vote (the words “Does the Union Abroad recognise in principle the
      resolution of the June Conference?” were altered to read: “The three
      organisations accept in principle the resolution of the June
      Conference”, etc.). Furthermore, the Union Abroad has not published
      the declaration of the Borba group which was presented to the
      bureau (see pp. 6-7 of this pamphlet).
    

      Not only has the Union Abroad failed to publish the contents of the speech
      delivered by a member of the Borba group after the Union had submitted
      amendments to the June resolutions, but it makes no reference whatever to
      the

      speech.[4]

      In that speech, a member of the Borba group, who had taken part in the
      June Conference, spoke against the amendments of the Union Abroad. The
      Union published the “arguments” in favour of the amendments,
      contained in a speech delivered at the Conference by B. Krichevsky,
      without, however, having presented them to the bureau. In a word, having
      rejected our proposal for the joint drafting of a summary of the entire
      discussion, the Union preferred to publish only what it thought of
      advantage to itself and to ignore even some of the things that were,
      presented to the bureau.
    

      We do not propose to follow that example. We have confined ourselves to
      the publication of all the declarations and documents presented to the
      bureau, with the bare statement as to the opinions expressed by the
      spokesmen of all the organisations represented at the
      Conference. Let the reader judge as to whether the articles in
      Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, and the amendments of the Union
      Abroad have violated the principle that was the basis of the agreement
      drawn up at the June Conference. Of course, we shall also leave unanswered
      the angry words that so profusely decorate the pages of the pamphlet of
      the Union Abroad, including the charges of “slander”, or of
      our having “broken up” the Conference by leaving it. Such
      accusations can only raise a smile. Three organisations gathered to
      discuss the question of unity. Two agreed that they could not unite with
      the third. Naturally, there was nothing left for the two organisations but
      to

    

      explain their position and depart. Only those who are angry because they
      are wrong can characterise this step as “breaking up” the
      Conference, or designate as “slander” the assertion that the
      Union Abroad wavers in questions of principle.
    

      As for our view of the controversial questions of Russian
      Social-Democracy, we prefer not to confuse the issue with an objective
      report of the Conference proceedings. In addition to the articles that
      have already appeared, and will appear, in Iskra and
      Zarya, we are preparing a special pamphlet on the urgent
      questions of our movement, to be published in the near future.

      According to the Conference standing orders, the minutes should have been
      approved by the Conference itself, each day’s proceedings commencing with
      the reading and approval of the minutes of the previous day’s
      proceedings. But on the second day, when the chairman, in opening the
      session, called for the minutes of the first day’s two sessions, the three
      secretaries in one voice declared that they could not present them. Owing
      to the absence of a stenographer, the records were in a most
      unsatisfactory state. It is quite understand able, therefore, that if the
      secretaries could not prepare the minutes on the night after the.first day
      of the Conference, it was useless to expect

   

that the minutes would be
      ready on the evening of the second day when we left the
      Conference. Everyone knew perfectly well that the minutes were not
      ready. Hence, the indignation of the Union Abroad over the
      “desertion” of our chairman, who “did not wait until the
      minutes of the Conference were approved” (Two Conferences,
      p. 29), is nothing but a subterfuge. Since there was no verbatim report,
      there was nothing else to do except for the three secretaries to get
      together and draw up at least a brief summary of the discussions. This, in
      fact, was our proposal, but the Union Abroad rejected it. Clearly, the
      responsibility for the absence of a summarised, if not a full, report of
      the Conference, rests upon the Union Abroad.

      We publish below the full text of another mass petition by means of which the
      Finnish people express their strong protest against the policy of the
      government, which has violated, and continues to violate, the constitution of
      Finland, thus breaking the oath solemnly taken by all the tsars, from
      Alexander I to Nicholas II.
    

      The petition was presented to the Finnish Senate on September 17 (30),
      1901, for submission to the tsar. It is signed by 473,363 Finnish men and
      women of all strata of society, i.e., by nearly half a million
      citizens. The total population of Finland is 2,500,000, so that this
      petition veritably expresses the voice of the entire people.
    

      The text reads in full:
    


“Most puissant, most gracious Sovereign, Emperor and Grand
      Duke! Your Imperial Majesty’s change of the law on military service
      in Finland has aroused general alarm and profound sorrow throughout the
      territory.
    

      The orders, the Manifesto, and the law on military service, confirmed by
      Your Imperial Majesty on July 12 (June 29) this year are in complete
      violation of the fundamental laws of the Grand Duchy, and of the precious
      rights belonging to the Finnish people and to all the citizens of the
      country by virtue of its laws.
    

      “In accordance with the fundamental laws, regulations governing
      citizens’ duties to defend the region may be issued only with the consent
      of the Diet. This was the procedure by which the Military Service Act of
      1878 was passed, in accordance with a joint-decision of the Emperor
      Alexander II and the Diet. During the reign of Emperor Alexander III,
      numerous specific changes were made in this Law, but none without the
      consent of the Diet. Despite this, the Law of 1878 is declared annulled,
      without the consent of the Diet, and the new orders issued in place of the
      old Law are at complete variance with the decision of the deputies to the
      Extraordinary Diet of 1899.
    

      “One of the most important rights vested in every Finnish citizen is
      the right to live and act under the protection of the Finnish laws.

    

      Today, thousands and thousands of Finnish citizens are deprived of this
      right, for the new Military Service Act compels them to serve in Russian
      units and converts military service into suffering for those sons of our
      country who will he forcibly drafted into these units, alien to them in
      language, religion, manners, and customs.
    

      “The new regulations abolish every legally fixed limitation of the annual
      contingent. Moreover, they contain no recognition of the right granted by the
      fundamental laws for the Diet to participate in drafting the military budget.
    

      “In violation of the fundamental principle of the Law of 1878, even the
      militia has been made entirely dependent upon the discretion of the Minister of
      War.
    

      “The impression created by such regulations is not modified by the
      measures of relief referred to in the Manifesto, which are to operate for
      a transitional period as yet undefined, because the temporary reduction in
      the number of recruits will be immediately followed by unlimited drafts
      for service with Russian units.
    

      “The Finnish people have not asked for any relief of the military
      burden they have carried. The Diet, which expresses the opinion of the
      people, has proved Finland’s readiness to increase its share in the
      defence of the state as far as it is in its power, on the condition that
      the juridical position of the Finnish troops as a Finnish institution is
      preserved.
    

      “Contrary to this, the new regulations state that the majority of the
      Finnish units are to be abolished and Russian officers permitted to enter
      the service of the few remaining units; that even the non-commissioned
      officers of these units must know the Russian language, which means that
      Finnish-born citizens mainly of peasant strata will be prevented from
      filling these posts; that these troops are to come under Russian
      administration and that they may, even in peace-time, be stationed outside
      of Finland.
    

      “These orders, which do not constitute a reform but merely pursue the
      aim of abolishing the national troops of Finland, are a sign of distrust
      which the Finnish people throughout almost a century of union with Russia
      have done nothing to deserve.
    

      “The new military service regulations also contain expressions, the
      implication of which is that the Finnish people have no fatherland of
      their own and that the rights of Finnish citizenship to those born in the
      country are denied. These expressions betray aims that are incompatible
      with the inalienable right of the Finnish people to preserve, in their
      union with Russia, the political position firmly guaranteed to Finland in
      1809.
    

      “A grave misfortune has beset our region during the recent
      years. Time and again it has been demonstrated that the established
      fundamental laws of the region are ignored, partly in legislative measures
      and partly in the assignment of Russians to important posts. The region
      has boon administered in a manner to suggest that the aim was to disturb
      peace and order, to hinder useful pursuits, and to cause friction between
      Russians and Finns.
    

      “The greatest misfortune that has befallen the country, however, is
      the introduction of the new military service regulations.
    
 

      “In its humble response of May 27, 1899, the Diet described in detail
      the order which, according to the fundamental laws of Finland, must be
      observed in the promulgation of a law on military service. It was pointed
      out that if a new law on military service is passed in any other way, that
      law, even if put into operation by force, cannot be recognised as a legal
      measure, and in the eyes of the Finnish people will be nothing more than
      an act of violence.
    

      “Everything the Diet indicated continues to be the Finnish people’s
      unchanging sense of justice, which cannot be changed by violence.
    

      “Serious consequences are to be feared from regulations not in accord
      with the laws of the country. The conscience of officials in government
      institutions will come into grave conflict with their sense of duty, for
      conscience will urge them to refuse to be guided by such regulations. The
      number of able-bodied emigrants compelled to leave the country from fear
      of the threatening changes will increase still more if the regulations
      announced will be put into effect.
    

      “The new military service regulations, like every other measure
      directed against the rights of the Finnish people to a separate political
      and national existence, must inevitably sow distrust between the monarch
      and the people, as well as give rise to growing discontent, to a sense of
      general oppression, to uncertainty, and to enormous difficulties for
      society and its members in the work for the welfare of the region. These
      evils cannot be avoided except by the substitution of the aforesaid
      regulations by a military service law passed jointly with the Diet, and in
      general by the strict observance of the fundamental laws on the part of
      the government authorities of the region.
    

      “The Finnish people cannot cease to be a separate people. United by a
      common historical fate, by juridical conceptions and cultural work, our
      people will remain true to its love of the Finnish fatherland and to its
      traditional liberty. The people will not deviate from its aspirations to
      occupy worthily the modest place fate has destined for it among the
      nations.
    

      “Firm in the conviction of our rights and in the respect for our laws
      which are our mainstay in our social life, we are no less firmly convinced
      that the unity of mighty Russia will suffer no damage if Finland continues
      in the future to be administered in accordance with the fundamental
      principles laid down in 1809, and in this way to feel happy and peaceful
      in its union with Russia.
    

      “The sense of duty to their country compels the inhabitants of all
      communities and social strata to submit to Your Imperial Majesty a true
      and unembellished record of the state of affairs. We pointed out above
      that the recently promulgated military service regulations, contradicting
      as they do the solemnly guaranteed fundamental laws of the Grand Duchy,
      cannot be regarded as a legal act. We consider it our duty to add that the
      military burden in itself is not nearly so important to the Finnish people
      as the loss of firmly established rights and of legally founded
      tranquillity on this most important question. We therefore humbly pray
      Your Imperial Majesty graciously to give the matters referred to in this
      petition the attention their seriousness calls for. We are, etc,”
    

 

      We have little to add to the above petition, which represents a people’s
      indictment of the gang of Russian official law-breakers.
    

      We shall enumerate the principal facts of the “Finnish
      question”.
    

      Finland was annexed to Russia in 1809, during the war with
      Sweden. Desiring to win over the Finns, who were formerly subjects of the
      Swedish King, Alexander I decided to recognise and confirm the old Finnish
      constitution. According to this constitution, no fundamental law can be
      made, amended, interpreted, or repealed without the consent of the
      Diet, i.e., the assembly of representatives of all social-estates.
      Alexander I, in a number of manifestos, “solemnly” confirmed
      “the promise sacredly to preserve the separate constitution of
      the country”.
    

      This sacred promise was subsequently confirmed by all succeeding Russian
      monarchs, including Nicholas II, who, in the Manifesto of October 25
      (November 6), 1894, “promised to preserve them [the fundamental
      laws] in their inviolable and immutable force and operation
    

      Within five years the Tsar of Russia had broken his solemn oath.
      Preceded by a campaign of vilification, conducted by the venal and servile
      press, the Manifesto of February 3 (15), 1899 was promulgated, introducing
      new regulations, according to which laws might be passed without the
      consent of the Diet “if these laws concern the requirements of
      the Empire as a whole or are part of imperial legislation”.
    

      This was a glaring violation of the constitution, a veritable coup
d’état, because every law can be said to concern the
requirements of the Empire as a whole!
    

      This coup d’état was brought about by violence: Governor
      General Bobrikov threatened to call troops into Finland if the Senate
      refused to publish the Manifesto. According to the statements made by
      Russian officers, ball cartridges were distributed to the Russian troops
      stationed in Finland, and horses were saddled, etc.
    

      The first act of violence was followed by innumerable others. Finnish
      newspapers were suppressed one after another, the right of assembly was
      annulled, Finland was flooded with swarms of Russian spies and despicable
      provocateurs, who incited the people to rebellion, etc., etc. Finally, the

    

      Military Service Act of June 29 (July 12) was passed, without the
      consent of the Diet. This law has been dealt with sufficiently in the
      petition.
    

      Both the Manifesto of February 3, 1899 and the Act of June 29, 1901 are
      illegal. This is the violence of a perjurer acting with a horde
      of bashi-bazouks called the tsarist government. It would be futile, of
      course, for 2,500,000 Finns to think of an uprising; but we, all Russian
      citizens, should ponder over the disgrace that puts us to shame. We are
      still slaves to such an extent that we are employed to reduce other
      peoples to slavery. We still tolerate a government that suppresses every
      aspiration towards liberty in Russia with the ferocity of an executioner,
      and that further more employs Russian troops for the purpose of violently
      infringing on the liberties of others!

Svoboda is a worthless little rag. Its author—indeed,
      this is precisely the impression it creates, that one person has written
      it all, from beginning to end—claims to write popularly “for
      the workers”. But what we have here is not popularisation, but
      talking down in the worst sense of the term. There is not one simple
      word, everything is twisted.... The author cannot write a single phrase
      without embellishments, without “popular” similes and
      “popular” catchwords such as “theirn”. Outworn
      socialist ideas are chewed over in this ugly language without any new
      data, any new examples, any new analysis, and the whole thing is
      deliberately vulgarised. Popularisation, we should like to inform the
      author, is a long way from vulgarisation, from talking down. The popular
      writer leads his reader towards profound thoughts, towards profound
      study, proceeding from simple and generally known facts; with the aid of
      simple arguments or striking examples he shows the main
      conclusions to be drawn from those facts and arouses in the
      mind of the thinking reader ever newer questions. The popular writer
      does not .presuppose a reader that does not think, that can not or does
      not wish to think; on the contrary, he assumes in the undeveloped reader
      a serious intention to use his head and aids him in his serious
      and difficult work, leads him, helps him over his first steps, and
      teaches him to go forward independently. The vulgar writer
      assumes that his reader does not think and is incapable of thinking; he
      does

    

      not lead him in his first steps towards serious knowledge, hut in a
      distortedly simplified form, interlarded with jokes and facetiousness,
      hands out “ready-made” all the conclusions of a known
      theory, so that the reader does not even have to chew but merely to
      swallow what he is given.

Svoboda (Freedom)—a journal published in
      Switzerland in 1901-02 by the Svoboda group that was formed in May 1901
      and that referred to itself as “a revolutionary socialist
      group”. Two issues appeared—No. 1 in 1901 and No. 2 in
      1902. The Svoboda group also issued The Eve of the Revolution: A
      Non-Periodical Review of Questions of Theory and of Tactics, No. 1;
      the publication 0tkliki (Responses), No, 1; the pamphlet
      The Renaissance of Revolutionism in Russia, by L. Nadezhdin and
      others.
    

      The Svoboda group was devoid of “serious, lasting ideas, of
      programme, tactics, organisation, or roots in the masses” (see
      present edition, Vol. 20, “On Adventurism”). Its publications
      advocated the ideas of, “Economism” and of terrorism and
      supported the anti-Iskra groups in Russia. The Svoboda group
      ceased to exist in 1903.

Below we publish in full, as received from one of our
representatives,
      


“A Letter to the Russian Social-Democratic Press.

“In response to the suggestion made by our comrades in exile that
we express our views on Iskra, we have resolved to state the
reasons for our disagreement with that organ.
      

“While recognising that the appearance of a special
Social-Democratic organ specially devoted to questions of the political
struggle is entirely opportune, we do not think that Iskra,
which has under taken this task, has performed it satisfactorily. The
principal drawback of the paper, which runs like a scarlet thread
through its columns, and which is the cause of all its other defects,
large and small, is the exaggerated importance it attaches to the
influence which the ideologists of the movement exert upon its various
tendencies. At the same time, Iskra gives too little
consideration to the material elements and the material environment of
the movement, whose interaction creates a definite type of labour
movement and determines its path, the path from which the ideologists,
despite all their efforts, are incapable of diverting it, even if they
are inspired by the finest theories and programmes.
    

      “This defect becomes most marked when Iskra is compared with
      Yuzhny

Rabochy,[1]

      which, like Iskra, raises the banner of
      political struggle but connects it with the preceding phase of the
      South-Russian working-class movement. Such a presentation of the question
      is alien to Iskra. It has set itself the task of fanning ’the
      spark into a great

      conflagration’,[A play on the word Iskra,
which means “spark”.—Tr.]

      but it forgets that necessary inflammable material and favourable
      environmental conditions are required for such a task. In dissociating
      itself completely from the ’Economists’, Iskra loses sight of the
      fact that their activity prepared the ground for the workers’
      participation in the February and March events, upon which Iskra
      lays so much stress and, to all appearances, greatly exaggerates. While
      criticising adversely the activity of the Social-Democrats of the late
      nineties, Iskra ignores the fact that at that time the conditions
      were

    

      lacking for any work other than the struggle for minor demands, and
      ignores also the enormous educational significance of that
      struggle. Iskra is entirely wrong and unhistorical in its
      appraisement of that period and of the direction of the activities of the
      Russian Social Democrats at the time, in identifying their tactics with
      those of

      Zubatov,[2]

      in failing to differentiate between the ’struggle for minor demands’,
      which widens and deepens the labour movement, and ’minor concessions’,
      whose purpose was to paralyse every struggle and every movement.
    

      “Thoroughly imbued with the sectarian intolerance so characteristic
      of ideologists in the infantile period of social movements, Iskra
      is ready to brand every disagreement with it, not only as a departure from
      Social-Democratic principles, but as desertion to the camp of the
      enemy. Of such a nature is its extremely indecent and most reprehensible
      attack upon Rabochaya Mysl, contained in the article on Zubatov,
      in which the latter’s success among a certain section of the working class
      was attributed to that publication. Negatively disposed to the other
      Social-Democratic organisations, which differ from it in their views on
      the progress and the tasks of the Russian labour movement, Iskra,
      in the heat of controversy, at times forgets the truth and, picking on
      isolated unfortunate expressions, attributes to its opponents views they
      do not hold, emphasises points of disagreement that are frequently of
      little material importance, and obstinately ignores the numerous points of
      contact in views. We have in mind Iskra s attitude towards
      Rabocheye Dyelo.
    

      “Iskra’s excessive predilection for controversy is due primarily
      to its exaggerating the role of ’ideology’ (programmes, theories...) in
      the movement, and is partly an echo of the internecine squabbles that have
      flared up among Russian political exiles in Western Europe, of which they
      have hastened to inform the world in a number of polemical pamphlets and
      articles. In our opinion, these disagreements exercise almost no influence
      upon the actual course of the Russian Social-Democratic movement, except
      perhaps to damage it by bringing an undesirable schism into the midst of
      the comrades working in Russia. For this reason, we cannot but express our
      disapproval of Iskra’s fervent polemics, particularly when it
      oversteps the bounds of decency.
    

      “This basic drawback of Iskra is also the cause of its
      inconsistency on the question of the attitude of Social-Democracy to the
      various social classes and tendencies. By theoretical reasoning,
      Iskra solved the problem of the immediate transition to the
      struggle against absolutism. In all probability it senses the difficulty
      of such a task for the workers under the present state of affairs but
      lacking the patience to wait until the workers will have gathered
      sufficient forces for this struggle, Iskra begins to seek allies
      in the ranks of the liberals and intellectuals. In this quest, it not
      infrequently departs from the class point of view, obscures class
      antagonisms, and puts into the forefront the common nature of the
      discontent with the government, although the causes and the degree of the
      discontent vary considerably among the ’allies Such, for example, is
      Iskra’s attitude towards the Zemstvo. It tries to fan into flames
      of political struggle the Zemstvo’s Frondian demonstrations, which are
      frequently called forth by the fact that the government

    

      pays more attention to the protection of industry than to the agrarian
      aspirations of the Zemstvo

      gentry,[Lenin’s reference is to the liberal landlords,
members of the Zemstvo Boards.—Tr.]

      and it promises the nobles that are dissatisfied with the governments sops
      the assistance of the working class, but it does not say a word about the
      class antagonism that exists between these social strata. It may be
      conceded that it is admissible to say that the Zemstvo is being roused and
      that it is an element fighting the government; but this must be stated so
      clearly and distinctly that no doubt will be left as to the character of a
      possible agreement with such elements. Iskra, however, approaches
      the question of our attitude towards the Zemstvo in a way that to our mind
      can only dim class-consciousness; for in this matter, like the advocates
      of liberalism and of the various cultural endeavours Iskra goes
      against the fundamental task of Social-Democratic literature, which is,
      not to obscure class antagonism, but to criticise the bourgeois system and
      explain the class interests that divide it. Such, too, is Iskra’s
      attitude towards the student movement. And yet in other articles
      Iskra sharply condemns all ’compromise’ and defends, for
      instance, the intolerant conduct of the Guesdists.
    

      “We shall refrain from dwelling upon Iskra’s minor defects
      and blunders, but in conclusion we think it our duty to observe that we do
      not in the least desire by our criticism to belittle the significance
      which Iskra can acquire, nor do we close our eyes to its
      merits. We welcome it as a political, Social-Democratic newspaper in
      Russia. We regard one of its greatest merits to be its able explanation of
      the question of terror to which it devoted a number of timely
      articles. Finally, we can not refrain from noting the exemplary, literary
      style in which Iskra is written, a thing so rare in illegal
      publications, its regular appearance, and the abundance of fresh and
      interesting material which it publishes.
    

      “A group of comrades”
    

      September 1901."
    


      In the first place, we should like to say that we cordially welcome the
      straightforwardness and frankness of the authors of this letter. It is
      high time to stop playing at hide-and-seek, concealing one’s Economist
      “credo” (as is done by a section of the Odessa
      Committee from which the “politicians” broke away), or
      declaring, as if in mockery of the truth, that at the present time
      “not a single Social-Democratic organisation is guilty of the sin of
      Economism” (Two Conferences, p. 32, published by
      Rabocheye Dyelo). And now to the matter.
    

      The authors of the letter fall into the very same fundamental error as
      that made by Rabocheye Dyelo (see particularly issue
      No. 10). They are muddled over the question

    

      of the relations between the “material” (spontaneous, as
      Rabocheye Dyelo puts it) elements of the movement and the
      ideological (conscious, operating “according to plan”). They fail to
      understand that the “ideologist” is worthy of the name only
      when he precedes the spontaneous movement, points out the road,
      and is able ahead of all others to solve all the theoretical, political,
      tactical, and organisational questions which the “material
      elements” of the movement spontaneously encounter. In order truly to
      give “consideration to the material elements of the movement”,
      one must view them critically, one must be able to point out the dangers
      and defects of spontaneity and to elevate it to the level of
      consciousness, To say, however, that ideologists (i.e., politically
      conscious leaders) cannot divert the movement from the path determined by
      the interaction of environment and elements is to ignore the simple truth
      that the conscious element participates in this interaction and
      in the determination of the path. Catholic and monarchist labour unions in
      Europe are also an inevitable result of the interaction of environment and
      elements, but it was the consciousness of priests and Zubatovs and not
      that of socialists that participated in this interaction. The theoretical
      views of the authors of this letter (like those of Rabocheye
      Dyelo) do not represent Marxism, but that parody of it which is
      nursed by our “Critics” and Bernsteinians who are unable to
      connect spontaneous evolution with conscious revolutionary activity.
    

      In the prevailing circumstances of today this profound theoretical error
      inevitably leads to a great tactical error, which has brought incalculable
      damage to Russian Social- Democracy. It is a fact that the spontaneous
      awakening of the masses of the workers and (due to their influence) of
      other social strata has been taking place with astonishing rapidity during
      the past few years. The “material elements” of the movement
      have grown enormously even as compared with 1898, but the conscious
      leaders (the Social-Democrats) lag behind this growth. This
      is the main cause of the crisis which Russian Social-Democracy is now
      experiencing. The mass (spontaneous) movement lacks
      “ideologists” sufficiently trained theoretically to be proof
      against all vacillations; it lacks leaders with such a broad political
      outlook, such

    

      revolutionary energy, and such organisational talent as to create a
      militant political party on the basis of the new movement.
    

      All this in itself would, however, be but half the evil. Theoretical
      knowledge, political experience, and organising ability are things that
      can be acquired. If only the desire exists to study and acquire these
      qualities. But since the end of 1897, particularly since the autumn of
      1898, there have come forward in the Russian Social-Democratic movement
      individuals and periodicals that not only close their eyes to this
      drawback, but that have declared it to be a special virtue, that have
      elevated the worship of, and servility towards, spontaneity to the dignity
      of a theory and are preaching that Social-Democrats must not march ahead
      of the movement, but should drag along at the tail-end. (These
      periodicals include not only Rabochaya Mysl, but Rabocheye
      Dyelo, which began with the “stages theory” and ended
      with the defence, as a matter of principle, of spontaneity, of the
      “full rights of the movement of the moment”, of
      “tactics-as process”, etc.)
    

      This was, indeed, a sad situation. It meant the emergence of a
separate trend, which is usually designated as Economism (in
the broad sense of the word), the principal feature of which is its
incomprehension, even defence, of lagging, i.e., as we have
explained, the lagging of the conscious leaders behind the spontaneous
awakening of the masses. The characteristic features of this trend
express themselves in the following: with respect to principles, in a
vulgarisation of Marxism and in helplessness in the face of modern
“criticism”, that up-to-date species of opportunism; with
respect to politics, in the striving to restrict political agitation and
political struggle or to reduce them to petty activities, in the failure
to understand that unless Social-Democrats take the leadership of the
general democratic movement in their own hands, they will never
be able to overthrow the autocracy; with respect to tactics, in utter
instability (last spring Rabocheye Dyelo stood in amazement
before the “new” question of terror, and only six months
later, after considerable wavering and, as always, dragging along at the
tail end of the movement, did it express itself against terror, in a
very ambiguous resolution); and with respect to

    

      organisation, in the failure to understand that the mass character of the
      movement does not diminish, but increases, our obligation to establish a
      strong and centralised organisation of revolutionaries capable of leading
      the preparatory struggle, every unexpected outbreak, and, finally, the
      decisive assault.
    

      Against this trend we have conducted and will continue to conduct an
      irreconcilable struggle. The authors of the letter apparently belong to
      this trend. They tell us that the economic struggle prepared the ground
      for the workers’ participation in the demonstrations. True enough; but we
      appreciated sooner and more profoundly than all others the importance of
      this preparation, when, as early as December 1900, in our first issue, we
      opposed the stages

      theory,[See present edition, Vol. 4,
pp. 366-71.—Ed.]

      and when, in February, in our second issue, immediately after the drafting
      of the students into the army, and prior to the demonstrations, we called
      upon the workers to come to the aid of the

      students.[Ibid.,
pp. 414-19.—Ed.]

      The February and March events did not “refute the fears and alarms
      of Iskra” (as Martynov, who thereby displays his utter
      failure to understand the question, thinks—Rabocheye Dyelo,
      No. 10, p. 53), but wholly confirmed them, for the leaders lagged
      behind the spontaneous rise of the masses and proved to be unprepared
      for the fulfilment of their duties as leaders. Even at the present time
      the preparations are far from adequate, and for that reason all talk about
      “exaggerating the role of ideology or the role of the conscious
      element as compared with the spontaneous element, etc., continues to
      exercise a most baneful influence upon our Party.
    

      No less harmful is the influence exerted by the talk, allegedly in defence
      of the class point of view, about the need to lay less stress on the
      general character of discontent manifested by the various strata of the
      population against the government. On the contrary, we are proud of the
      fact that Iskra rouses political discontent among all strata of
      the population, and the only thing we regret is that we are unable to do
      this on a much wider scale. It is not true to say that in doing so, we
      obscure the class point of view; the authors of the letter

    

      have not pointed to a single concrete instance in evidence of this, nor
      can they do so. Social-Democracy, as the van guard in the struggle for
      democracy, must (notwithstanding the opinion expressed in Rabocheye
      Dyelo, No. 10, p. 41) lead the activities of the various oppositional
      strata, explain to them the general political significance of their
      partial and professional conflicts with the government, rally them to the
      support of the revolutionary party, and train from its own ranks leaders
      capable of exercising political influence upon all oppositional
      strata. Any renunciation of this function, however florid the phrases
      about close, organic contact with the proletarian struggle, etc., with
      which it may deck it self, is tantamount to a fresh “defence of
      lagging”, the defence of lagging behind the nation-wide democratic
      movement on the part of Social-Democrats; it is tantamount to a surrender
      of the leadership to bourgeois democracy. Let the authors of the letter
      ponder over the question as to why the events of last spring served so
      strongly to stimulate non-Social-Democratic revolutionary tendencies,
      instead of raising the authority and prestige of Social-Democracy.
    

      Nor can we refrain from protesting against the astonishing
      short-sightedness displayed by the authors of the letter in regard to the
      controversies and internecine squabbles among the political exiles. They
      repeat the stale nonsense about the “indecency” of devoting to
      Rabochaya Mysl an article on Zubatov. Do they wish to deny that
      the spreading of Economism facilitates the tasks of the Zubatovs? In
      asserting this, however, we do not in the slightest “identify”
      the tactics of the Economists with those of Zubatov. As for the
      “political exiles” (if the authors of the letter were not so
      unpardonably careless concerning the continuity of ideas in the Russian
      Social-Democratic movement, they would have known that the warning about
      Economism sound ed by the “political exiles”, to be precise,
      by the Emancipation of Labour group, has been strikingly confirmed!), note
      the manner in which Lassalle, who was active among the Rhine workers in
      1852, judged the controversies of the exiles in London. Writing to Marx,
      he said:
    

      “...The publication of your work against the ’big men’, Kinkel, Ruge,
      etc., should hardly meet with any difficulties on the part of the
      police.... For, in my opinion, the government

    

      is not averse to the publication of such works, because it thinks
      that ’the revolutionaries will cut one another’s throats’. Their
      bureaucratic logic neither suspects nor fears the fact that it is
      precisely internal Party struggles that lend a party strength and
      vitality; that the greatest proof of a party’s weakness is its diffuseness
      and the blurring of clear demarcations; and that a party becomes stronger
      by purging itself” (letter from Lassalle to Marx, June 24, 1852).
    

      Let the numerous complacent opponents of severity, irreconcilability, and
      fervent polemics, etc., take note!
    

      In conclusion, we shall observe that in these remarks we have been able to
      deal only briefly with the questions in dispute. We intend to devote a
      special pamphlet to the analysis of these questions, which we hope will
      appear in the course of six weeks.

      distinguished for their instability on questions of principle”. The
      group existed until the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. Subsequently the
      majority of the leading members of the group became Mensheviks.

Zubatov—Colonel of the Gendarmes, tried to introduce
      “police socialism”. He set up fake workers’ organisations

The Editorial Board of Iskra joins whole-heartedly in
celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the revolutionary activity
of G. V. Plekhanov. May this celebration serve to strengthen the
positions of revolutionary Marxism, which alone can guide the world
struggle of the proletariat for emancipation and resist the attacks of
eternally old opportunism that is recurrently making its noisy
appearance in new guises. May this celebration serve to strengthen the
bonds between the thousands of young Russian Social- Democrats who are
devoting all their efforts to difficult practical work and the
Emancipation of Labour group, which is providing the movement with what
it stands so much in need of—a tremendous reserve of theoretical
knowledge, wide political horizons, and rich revolutionary experience.
      

Long live Russian revolutionary Social-Democracy! Long live
international Social-Democracy!

      A fortnight ago we observed the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first
      social-revolutionary demonstration in Russia, which took place on December
      6, 1876, on Kazan Square in St.

      Petersburg,[1]

      and we pointed to the enormous upswing in the number and magnitude of the
      demonstrations at the beginning of the current year. We urged that the
      demonstrators should advance a political slogan more clearly defined than
      “Land and

      Freedom”[2]

      (1876), and a more far-reaching demand than “Repeal the Provisional
      Regulations” (1901). Such a slogan must be: political
      freedom; and the demand to be put forward by the entire people has to
      be the demand for the convocation of the people’s
      representatives.
    

      We see now that demonstrations are being revived on the most varied
      grounds in Nizhni-Novgorod, in Moscow, and in Kharkov. Public unrest is
      growing everywhere, and more and more imperative becomes the necessity to
      unify it into one single current directed against the autocracy,
      which everywhere sows tyranny, oppression, and violence. On November 7, a
      small but successful demonstration was held in Nizhni-Novgorod, which
      arose out of a farewell gathering in honour of Maxim Gorky. An author of
      European fame, whose only weapon was free speech (as a speaker at the
      Nizhni-Novgorod demonstration aptly put it), was being banished by the
      autocratic government from his home town without trial or
      investigation. The bashi bazouks accuse him of exercising a harmful
      influence on us, said the speaker in the name of all Russians in whom but
      a spark of striving towards light and liberty is alive, but we declare
      that his influence has been a good one. The myrmidons

    

      of the tsar perpetrate their outrages in secret, and we will expose their
      outrages publicly and openly. In Russia, workers are assaulted for
      demanding their right to a better life; students are assaulted for
      protesting against tyranny. Every honest and bold utterance is suppressed!
      The demonstration, in which workers took part, was concluded by a student
      reciting: “Tyranny shall fall, and the people shall
      rise—mighty, free, and strong!”
    

      In Moscow, hundreds of students waited at the station to greet
      Gorky. Meanwhile, the police, scared out of their wits, arrested
      him on the train en route and (despite the special permission
      previously granted him) prohibited his entering Moscow, forcing him to
      change directly from the Nizhni-Novgorod to the Kursk line. The
      demonstration against Gorky’s banishment failed; but on the eighteenth of
      November, without any preparation, a small demonstration of students and
      “strangers” (as our Ministers put it) took place in front of
      the Governor General’s house against the prohibition of a social evening
      arranged for the previous day to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of
      the death of N. A.

      Dobrolyubov.[3]

      The representative of the autocracy in Moscow was howled down by people
      who, in unison with all educated and thinking people in Russia, held dear
      the memory of a writer who had passionately hated tyranny and passionately
      looked forward to a people’s uprising against the “Turks at
      home”, i.e., against the autocratic government. The Executive
      Committee of the Moscow Students’ Organisations rightly pointed out in its
      bulletin of November 23 that the unprepared demonstration served as a
      striking indication of the prevailing discontent and protest.
    

      In Kharkov, a demonstration called in connection with student affairs
      developed into a regular street battle, in which the students were not the
      only participants. Last year’s experience taught the students a
      lesson. They realised that only the support of the people, especially of
      the workers, could guarantee them success, and that in order to obtain
      that support, they must not restrict them selves to struggling merely for
      academic (student) freedom, but for the freedom of the entire
      people, for political freedom. The Kharkov Joint Council of
      Students’ Organisations

    

      definitely expressed this idea in its October manifesto and, judging from
      their leaflets and manifestos, the students of St. Petersburg, Moscow,
      Kiev, Riga, and Odessa are beginning to understand the
      “senselessness of the dream” of academic freedom amidst the
      gloom of enslavement enshrouding the people. The infamous speech delivered
      by General Vannovsky in Moscow, in which he denied the
      “rumours” that he had at one time promised something, the
      unparalleled insolence of the St. Petersburg detective (who seized a
      student in the Institute of Electrical Engineering in order to take from
      him a letter he had received by messenger), the savage assault upon
      Yaroslavl students by the police in the streets and in the
      police-station—these and a thousand other facts sound their cry for
      struggle, struggle, struggle against the whole of the autocratic
      system. Patience became exhausted in the case of the Kharkov
      veterinaries. The first-year students submitted a petition for the
      dismissal of Professor Lagermark, on account of his bureaucratic attitude
      towards their studies and his intolerable rudeness in which he went so far
      as to fling copies of the syllabus in the faces of the students! Without
      investigating the case, the government responded by expelling the entire
      first-year student body from the Institute, and in addition slandered the
      students by declaring in its report that they demanded the right to
      appoint the professors. This roused the entire Kharkov student body to
      action, and it was resolved to organise a strike and a
      demonstration. Between November 28 and December 2, Kharkov was for the
      second time in the same year transformed into a field of battle between
      the “Turks at home” and the people, which protested against
      autocratic tyranny. On the one side, shouts of, “Down with the
      autocracy!”, “Long live liberty!”— on the other, sabres,
      knouts, and horses trampling upon the people. The police and Cossacks,
      mercilessly assaulting all and sundry, irrespective of age and sex, gained
      a victory over an unarmed crowd and are now triumphant....
    

      Shall we allow them to triumph?
    

      Workers! You know only too well the evil force that is tormenting the
      Russian people. This evil force binds you hand and foot in your everyday
      struggles against the employers for a better life and for human
      dignity. This evil force

    

      snatches hundreds and thousands of your best comrades from your midst,
      flings them into jail, sends them into banishment, and, as if in mockery,
      declares them to be “persons of evil conduct”. This evil force
      on May 7 fired on the workers of the Obukhov Works in St. Petersburg, when
      they rose up with the cry, “We want liberty!”—and then staged
      a farce of a trial, in order to send to penal servitude those heroes who
      escaped the bullets. This evil force is assaulting students today, and
      tomorrow it will fling itself with greater ferocity upon you. Lose no
      time! Remember that you must support every protest and every struggle
      against the bashi-bazouks of the autocratic government! Exert every effort
      to come to an agreement with the demonstrating students, organise circles
      for the rapid transmission of information and for the distribution of
      leaflets, explain to all that you are struggling for the freedom of the
      entire people.
    

      When the flames of popular indignation and open struggle flare up, first
      in one place and then in another, it is more than ever necessary to direct
      upon them a powerful current of fresh air, to fan them into a great
      conflagration!
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]

The
      demonstration on December 6(18) 1876 was organised by workers and students
      as a protest against the tyrannical actions of the autocracy. Plekhanov,
      who took part in the demonstration, delivered a revolutionary speech. The
      demonstration was broken up by the police, and many participants were
      arrested and sentenced to banishment or penal servitude.
    



[2]

      The slogan “Land and Freedom” was released at that
      time by an illegal organisation of the same name (Zemlya i Volya), founded
      by the Narodniks in Russia in 1876. Among the leading members were
      G. V. Plekhanov, A. D. Mikhailov, 0. V. Aptekman, A. A. Kvyatkovsky,
      S. M. Kravchinsky (Stepoyak), S. L. Perovskaya, N. A. Morozov, and
      V. N. Figner.
    

      The Zemlya i Volya organisation viewed the peasantry as the chief
      revolutionary force in Russia and sought to bring about an uprising of the
      peasantry against tsarism. It conducted revolutionary activity in a number
      of Russian gubernias—Tambov, Voronezh, and others. in 1879 a
      terrorist grouping was formed in Zemlya i Volya which regarded individual
      terror to be the chief means of fighting against tsarism. At a congress
      held in Voronezh that year Zemlya i Volya split into two groups: Narodnaya
      Volya (The People’s Will) and Chorny Peredel (General Redistribution).

      We have received a letter from “Southern Workers” welcoming
      the strengthening of the revolutionary current in Russian Social-Democracy
      and asking us to convey their greetings to the League of Russian
      Revolutionary Social- Democracy Abroad. Unfortunately we cannot print the
      letter in full, due to lack of space. We are in complete accord with the
      authors of the letter that “the methods adopted in Russia for
      bringing revolutionary ideas to the masses through proclamations are not
      adequate for educating the masses to political consciousness”, that
      “it is essential to establish a special literature for the political
      education of the Russian proletariat”. But their proposal to issue,
      for that purpose, popular pamphlets of three or four pages to be
      distributed “simultaneously throughout Russia” is hardly
      feasible. We hold that the Russian proletariat is now mature enough for
      the type of publication that is serviceable to all other
      classes—viz., newspapers. Only a political newspaper can really
      educate the masses to become politically conscious and, in the words of
      the letter, throw light on “the whole of our social life, from the
      fourth estate to the big bourgeoisie”. Only an All-Russian news
      paper, if actively supported by all committees and local study circles,
      can achieve distribution more or less “simultaneously throughout
      Russia” and be published frequently enough to deserve the name of
      newspaper. Only the firm establishment of a revolutionary organ of this
      type can mark the transition of our movement from “strikes and the
      economic struggle to the broad revolutionary struggle against the Russian
      autocratic government”.

    See also in Volume 10:
      Socialism and Anarchism (1905)


      Theses:
 

      1. Anarchism, in the course of the 35 to 40 years (Bakunin and
      the International, 1866–) of its existence (and with
      Stirner included, in the course of many more years) has produced
      nothing but general platitudes against exploitation.
    

      These phrases have been current for more than 2,000 years. What
      is missing is (alpha) an understanding of the causes of
      exploitation; (beta) an understanding of the development
      of society, which leads to socialism; (gamma) an understanding
      of the class struggle as the creative force for the
      realisation of socialism.
    

      2. An understanding of the causes of
      exploitation. Private property as the basis of
      commodity economy. Social property in the means of
      production. In anarchism–nil.
    

      Anarchism is bourgeois individualism in
      reverse. Individualism as the basis of the entire anarchist
      world outlook.
    

      {

 Defence of petty property and petty economy on the
      land. Keine

Majorität.[1]


      Negation of the unifying and organising power of the authority.

       }
    

      3. Failure to understand the development of society–the role of
         large-scale production–the development of capitalism into
         socialism.
    

      (Anarchism is a product of despair. The psychology of
      the unsettled intellectual or the vagabond and not of the
      proletarian.)
    
 

      4. Failure to understand the class struggle of the
         proletariat.
    

      Absurd negation of politics in bourgeois society.
    

      Failure to understand the role of the organisation and the
      education of the workers.
    

      Panaceas consisting of one-sided, disconnected means.
    

      5. What has anarchism, at one time dominant in the Romance
         countries, contributed in recent European history?
    

      – No doctrine, revolutionary teaching, or theory.
    

      – Fragmentation of the working-class movement.
    

      – Complete fiasco in the experiments of the revolutionary
         movement (Proudhonism, 1871; Bakuninism, 1873).
    

      – Subordination of the working class to bourgeois
         politics in the guise of negation of politics.

      Our newspapers as usual, have published the most respectful report of the
      Minister of Finance on the budget— the state revenues and
      disbursements for 1902. As usual, everything, according to the Minister’s
      assurance, is going well: “the finances are in a most satisfactory
      state”, “equilibrium has been firmly maintained in the
      budget”, “the railway system continues its successful
      development”, and there is even “a steady improvement in the
      people’s welfare”! Small wonder that so little interest is shown in
      questions of the state economy, despite their importance; interest is
      blunted by the obligatory, standard eulogies; for everyone knows that
      paper will put up with anything, that “anyway” the public
      “isn’t allowed to peep” behind the scenes of official
      financial juggling.
    

      On this occasion, however, the following circumstance stands out
      particularly. With his usual legerdemain the conjurer shows the public his
      empty bands, makes passes, and produces one gold coin after another. The
      public applauds. Nevertheless, the conjurer begins to make the most
      frantic efforts to defend himself and is almost in tears when he assures
      us that he is not deceiving us, that there is no deficit, and that his
      liabilities are less than his assets. Russians have been so well schooled
      in respectable behaviour in official places that even as onlookers they
      feel uncomfortable, and only a few mutter the French saying under their
      breath: “He who excuses himself accuses himself.”
    

      Let us see how our Witte “excuses” himself. The gigantic
      expenditure, amounting to almost 2,000 million rubles (1,946 million), has
      been fully covered only because of

    

      the 144 million taken from the famous “free cash in hand” at
      the State Treasury, which free cash in hand was made up by last year’s 4
      per cent loan of 127 million rubles (floated at 148 million rubles, of
      which 21 million have still not been taken up). In other words, a deficit
      covered by the loan? Nothing of the sort, says our magician, “the
      loan was certainly not floated because of the need to cover expenditures
      unforeseen in the estimate”, since 114 million rubles remained
      “completely free” after the coverage; the loan was raised
      because it was desired to build new, railways.
    

      Well said, Mr. Witte! But, first, what you say does not refute the fact of
      the deficit, since 114 million rubles, even if “completely
      free”, cannot cover an expenditure of 144 million rubles. Secondly,
      the free cash in hand (114 million rubles) included 63 million received in
      excess of the usual revenue for 1901, as compared with the budget
      estimate, and our press has long since revealed the fact that you
      artificially reduce the estimate for the budget revenue in order
      to effect a fictitious increase in the “free cash in hand” and
      steadily increase taxation. Last year, for instance, stamp duties were
      raised (the new stamp duty regulations), the price of government-distilled
      vodka rose from 7 rubles to 7 rubles 60 kopeks a

      vedro,[1 vedro—about 12.3 litres (21.7
pints).—Tr.]

      customs duties continued to increase (increases were introduced
      “temporarily” in 1900 on account of the war in China), and so
      on. Thirdly, while you laud the “cultural role” of the
      railways, you modestly refrain from mentioning the purely Russian and very
      uncultured custom of plundering the Treasury when rail ways are
      built (to say nothing of the shameful exploitation of the workers and the
      starving peasants by railway contractors!). Thus, a Russian newspaper
      recently reported that the cost of building the Siberian railway was
      initially estimated at 350 million rubles, but that in actuality 780
      million have been expended and that in the end the total cost will
      probably exceed 1,000 million (Iskra has had something to say
      about the plunder on the Siberian railway: see issue No. 2). You compute
      the revenues with precision, Mr. Witte, omitting nothing, but how about
      rendering an account of the actual extent of the expenditure?
    
 

      Another matter not to be forgotten is the fact that the building of
      railways in 1902 was undertaken partly because of the military purposes of
      our “peace-loving” government (the vast Bologoye-Sedlets line,
      more than 1,000 versts long) and partly because of the absolute necessity
      to afford at least some “help” to oppressed industry, in whose
      affairs the State Bank is directly interested. The State Bank has not only
      granted loans with a liberal hand to tottering enterprises, but has
      practically taken many of them under its full control. The bankruptcy of
      industrial enterprises threatened to lead to the bankruptcy of the state!
      Lastly, let us not forget, either, that it is under the administration of
      the “genius” Witte that the sum of the loans and the size of
      the taxes are constantly increasing, despite the fact that the capital of
      the savings-banks is applied exclusively to support state credits. This
      capital has already exceeded 800 million rubles. Taking all this into
      consideration, we realise that Witte’s economy is wasteful, that the
      autocracy is heading slowly but surely for bankruptcy, since taxation
      cannot be raised indefinitely and the French bourgeoisie will not always
      come to the aid of the Russian Tsar.
    

      Against the charge of having increased the national debt Witte defends
      himself with arguments that are sheerly ludicrous. He compares liabilities
      with “assets”, he compares the sum of the state loans for 1892
      and 1902 with the costs of the state railways for the same years and
      produces a reduction in the “net” debt. But we have still
      further assets: “Fortresses and warships” (I swear, the report
      had it so!), harbours and government factories, quit-rent, and forests.
    

      Magnificent, Mr. Witte! But have you not noticed that you are like the
      merchant summoned to court as a bankrupt who tried to justify himself
      before the bailiffs who were about to make an inventory of his property?
      As long as an enterprise is unshakably solvent no one would dream of
      asking that loans be specially guaranteed. No one doubts that the Russian
      people have plenty of “assets”; but the greater these assets,
      the greater the guilt of those who, despite the abundance, conduct the
      economy by increasing loans and taxation. You are merely demonstrating to
      the people that they should get rid of those who squander their

    

      assets, and do so as quickly as possible. In actual fact, of all the
      European countries, Turkey alone has so far put forward special state
      assets as a guarantee of state loans. This action has naturally led to
      the assumption of control by foreign creditors over the assets
      that were to guarantee them the return of the loans they had advanced. The
      economy of the “great Russian state” administered by
      representatives of Rothschild and of Bleichröder—what
      glittering prospects you open up before us, Mr.

      Witte![1]


      This is quite apart from the fact that there is no banker who will accept
      fortresses and Warships as collateral, that these represent a minus, not a
      plus, in our economy. Even railways can serve as a .guarantee only when
      they are run at a profit. However, from Mr. Witte’s report we learn that
      up to the present all Russian railways have, in general, been run at a
      loss. Only in 1900 was the deficit on the Siberian railways covered and a
      “small net profit” obtained—so small that Mr. Witte
      remains modestly silent as to its amount. He also remains silent in regard
      to the fact that in the first eight months of 1901 the takings of the
      railways in European Russia dropped as a result of the crisis. We can well
      imagine the balance of our railway economy if the actual sums of money
      plundered during construction, as well as the official sums allotted for
      the job, were taken into consideration. Is it not high time to place these
      valuable assets in more reliable hands?
    

      Needless to say, Witte speaks in the most soothing tones of the industrial
      crisis: “The hitch ... without doubt does not affect general
      industrial prosperity and, after a certain interval of time, we shall
      probably [!] see a fresh period of industrial revival.” Fine comfort for
      the mil lions of the working class, who suffer from unemployment and
      reduced wages! You may search in vain in the list of state expenditures
      for the slightest hint of the millions and

    

      tens of millions that the Treasury has wasted on direct and indirect
      support of the industrial enterprises “suffering” from the
      crisis. What gigantic sums are involved in such support may be seen from
      press reports to the. effect that the total sum of the loans granted by
      the State Bank between January 1, 1899 and January 1, 1901 increased from
      250 million to 449 million rubles, and that industrial loans increased
      from 8,700,000 to 38,800,000 rubles. Even the loss of four million rubles
      from industrial loans did not cause the Treasury any difficulty. And as
      for the workers who have sacrificed on the altar of “industrial
      success”, not the contents of their purse, but their lives and the
      lives of the millions dependent on them, the Treasury helped these workers
      by sending thousands of them from the industrial towns to the starving
      villages “free of charge”!
    

      Witte avoids the word “famine” altogether, assuring us in his
      report that the “detrimental effects of the poor harvest ... will be
      mitigated by generous help to the needy”. This generous help,
      according to him, amounts to 20 million rubles, while the deficit in the
      harvest is estimated at 230 million rubles (if one takes as the base the
      very low price of 50 kopeks a pood, compared, however, with the years of
      favourable harvests). Indeed, how very “generous”! Even if we assume
      that only a half of the losses is borne by the poor peasantry, it will
      still become evident that we underestimated the greed of the Russian
      Government, when we wrote (in re Sipyagin’s circular; see Iskra,
      No.

      9)[See present volume,
        pp. 231-38.—Ed.]

      that the government was cutting relief loans down to one-fifth.
      The Russian Tsar is generous, not in his aid to the peasant, but in his
      police measures directed against those who really wanted to help the
      famine-stricken. He is also generous in squandering millions in order to
      grab an appetising slice in China. In two years, Witte informs us, 80
      million rubles went in extraordinary expenditure on the war in China
      and “in addition very substantial sums were expended
      from the ordinary budget”. This means that anything up to
      100 million rubles was expended, if not more! The unemployed
      worker and the starving peasant

    

      may take comfort from the fact that Manchuria is almost sure to be ours...
    

      Lack of space keeps us from dealing at length with the remaining parts of
      the report. Witte also defends himself against the charge of scantiness in
      the disbursements on public education: to the 36 million rubles of the
      estimate of the Ministry of Public Education he adds the disbursements of
      other ministries on education and “cooks up” the figure of 75
      million rubles. But even this figure (of doubtful veracity) is extremely
      miserable for the whole of Russia, representing less than five per cent of
      the total budget.
    

      The fact that “our state budget is organised mainly on the basis of,
      a system of indirect taxation” is considered by Witte to be an
      advantage, and he repeats the stale bourgeois arguments on the possibility
      of “adjusting the consumption of taxed articles to accord with the
      degree of prosperity”. In actual fact, however, it is notorious that
      indirect taxation affecting articles of mass consumption is distinguished
      by its extreme injustice. The entire burden is placed on the shoulders of
      the poor, while it creates a privilege for the rich. The poorer a man is,
      the greater the share of his income that goes to the state in the form of
      indirect taxes. The masses who own little or nothing constitute
      nine-tenths of the population, consume nine-tenths of the taxed items, and
      pay nine-tenths of the total of all indirect taxes, while they receive no
      more than two- or three-tenths of the national income.
    

      In conclusion, an interesting “trifle”. On which items were
      expenditures most of all increased from 1901 to 1902? The total
      expenditures increased from 1,788 million to 1,946 million
      rubles, that is, by less than one-tenth. Nevertheless, expenditures on
      two items increased by nearly a quarter: from 9,800,000
      to 12,800,000 rubles “for the maintenance of members of the royal
      family” and ... “for the maintenance of the special corps of
      gendarmes” from 3,960,000 to 4,940,000 rubles. We have here the
      answer to the question: What are “the most urgent needs of the
      Russian people”? And what touching “unity” between the tsar and the
      gendarmes!
    

 
Notes
 

[1]

      Witte himself was aware of the clumsiness of his arguments in regard to
      “assets” and therefore, elsewhere in his report, he tried to
      improve tire impression by saying that the growing value of state assets
      “has no particular significance with respect to the commitments of
      the Russian Treasury, since Russia’s credit does not stand in need of
      special guarantees”. Of course not! But a detailed account with a
      list of these special guarantees was left ... Just in case!

      Let us begin with an illustration.
    

      The reader will remember the sensation that was creat ed by the speech
      delivered by M. A. Stakhovich, Marshal of the Nobility of Orel Gubernia,
      at a missionary congress, in the course of which he urged that freedom
      oj conscience be recognised by law. The conservative press, led by
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti, is conducting a furious cam paign against
      Mr. Stakhovich. It cannot find names vile enough with which to call him
      and almost goes so far as to accuse the entire Orel nobility of high
      treason for having re-elected Mr. Stakhovich as Marshal. Now, this
      re-election is indeed very significant and to a certain degree it bears
      the character of a demonstration of the nobility against police tyranny
      and outrage.
    

      Stakhovich, says Moskovskiye Vedomosti, “is not so much
      Marshal of the Nobility, as the oh, so gay Misha Stakh ovich, the life and
      soul of the party, the clever conver sationalist...” (No. 348, 1901). So
      much the worse for you, gentlemen, defenders of the bludgeon. If even our
      jovial landlords begin to talk about freedom of conscience, then the
      infamies of the priests and the police must verily be without number....
    

      “What does our ’intellectual’, frivolous crowd that instigates and
      applauds the Stakhoviches care for the affairs of our sacred orthodox
      faith and our time-honoured attitude towards it?”... Once again, so much
      the worse for you, gentlemen, champions of the autocracy, the orthodox
      faith, and the national essence. A fine system indeed our police ridden
      autocracy must be, if it has permeated even religion

    

      with the spirit of the prison-cell, so that the “Stakhoviches”
      (who have no firm convictions in matters of religion, but who are
      interested, as we shall see, in preserving a stable religion) become
      utterly indifferent (if not actually hostile) to this notorious
      “national” faith. "... They call our faith a delusion!!
      They mock at us because, thanks to this ’delusion’, we fear and try to
      avoid sin and we carry out our obligations uncomplainingly, no matter how
      severe they may be; because we find the strength and courage to bear
      sorrow and privations and forbear pride in times of success and good
      fortune...." So! The orthodox faith is dear to them because it
      teaches people to bear misery “uncomplainingly”. What a
      profitable faith it is indeed for the governing classes! In a society so
      organised that an insignificant minority enjoys wealth and power, while
      the masses constantly suffer “privations” and bear
      “severe obligations”, it is quite natural for the exploiters
      to sympathise with a religion that teaches people to bear
      “uncomplainingly” the hell on earth for the sake of an alleged
      celestial paradise. But in its zeal Moskovskiye Vedomosti became
      too garrulous. So garrulous, in fact, that unwittingly it spoke the
      truth. We read on: "... They do not suspect that if they, the
      Stakhoviches, eat well, sleep peacefully, and live merrily, it is thanks
      to this ’delusion’.”
    

      The sacred truth! This is precisely the case. It is because religious
      “delusions” are so widespread among the masses that the
      Stakhoviches and the

      Oblomovs,”[1]

      and all our capitalists who live by the labour of the masses, and even
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti itself, “sleep peacefully”. And
      the more education spreads among the people, the more will religious
      prejudices give way to socialist consciousness, the nearer will be the day
      of victory for the proletariat —the victory that will emancipate all
      oppressed classes from the slavery they endure in modern society.
    

      But having blurted out the truth on one point, Moskovskiye
      Vedomosti disposed, far too easily, of another interesting point. It
      is obviously mistaken in believing that the Stakhoviches “do not
      realise” the significance of religion, and that they demand liberal
      forms out of sheer “thoughtlessness”. Such an interpretation
      of a hostile political trend is too childishly näive. The fact that
      in this

    

      instance Mr. Stakhovich came forward as advocate of the entire liberal
      trend was proved best of all by Moskovskiye Vedomosti itself;
      otherwise, what need was there for waging such a campaign against a single
      speech? What need was there for speaking, not about Stakhovich, but about
      the Stakhoviches, about the “intellectual crowd”?
    

Moskovskiye Vedomosti’s error was, of course, deliberate. That
      paper is more unwilling than it is unable to analyse the liberalism it
      bates from the class point of view. That it does not desire to do so goes
      without saying; but its inability to do so interests us very much more,
      because this is a complaint that even very many revolutionaries and
      socialists suffer from. Thus, the authors of the letter published in
      No. 12 of Iskra, who accuse us of departing from the “class
      point of view” for striving in our newspaper to follow all
      manifestations of liberal discontent and protest, suffer from this
      complaint, as do also the authors of Proletarskaya

Borba[2]

      and of several pamphlets in “The Social-Democratic

      Library”,[3]

      who imagine that our autocracy represents the absolutist rule of the
      bourgeoisie; likewise the Martynovs, who seek to persuade us to abandon
      the many-sided campaign of exposure (i.e., the widest possible political
      agitation) against the autocracy and to concentrate our efforts mainly
      upon the struggle for economic re forms (to give something
      “positive” to the working class, to put forward in its name
      “concrete demands” for legislative and administrative measures
      “which promise certain palpable results”); likewise, too, the
      Nadezhdins, who, on reading the correspondence in our paper on the
      statistical conflicts, ask in astonishment: “Good Lord, what is
      this—a Zemstvo paper?”
    

      All these socialists forget that the interests of the autocracy coincide
      only with certain interests of the proper tied classes, and only under
      certain circumstances; frequently it happens that its interests do not
      coincide with the interests of these classes, as a whole, but only with
      those of certain of their strata. The interests of other bourgeois strata
      and the more widely understood interests of the entire
      bourgeoisie, of the development of capitalism as a whole, necessarily give
      rise to a liberal opposition to the autocracy. For instance, the autocracy
      guarantees the

    

      bourgeoisie opportunities to employ the crudest forms of exploitation,
      but, on the other hand, places a thousand obstacles in the way of the
      extensive development of the productive forces and the spread of
      education; in this way it arouses against itself, not only the petty
      bourgeoisie, but at times even the big bourgeoisie. The autocracy
      guarantees (?) the bourgeoisie protection against socialism, but since the
      people are deprived of rights, this protection is necessarily transformed
      into a system of police outrages that rouse the indignation of the entire
      people. What the result of these antagonistic tendencies is, what relative
      strength of conservative and liberal views, or trends, among the
      bourgeoisie obtains at the present moment, cannot be learned from a couple
      of general theses, for this depends on all the special features of the
      social and political situation at a given moment. To determine this, one
      must study the situation in detail and carefully watch all the conflicts
      with the government, no matter by what social stratum they are
      initiated. It is precisely the “class point of view” that
      makes it impermissible for a Social-Democrat to remain
      indifferent to the discontent and the protests of the
      “Stakhoviches”.
    

      The reasoning and activity of the above-mentioned socialists show that
      they are indifferent to liberalism and thus reveal their incomprehension
      of the basic theses of the Communist Manifesto, the
      “Gospel” of international Social-Democracy. Let us recall, for
      instance, the words that the bourgeoisie itself provides material for the
      political education of the proletariat by its struggle for power, by the
      conflicts of various strata and groups within it,

      etc.[4]

      Only in politically free countries has the proletariat easy access to this
      material (and then only to part of it). In enslaved Russia, however, we
      Social-Democrats must work hard to obtain this “material” for
      the working class, i.e., we must ourselves undertake the task of
      conducting general political agitation, of carrying on a public exposure
      campaign against the autocracy. This task is particularly imperative in
      periods of political ferment. We must bear in mind that in one year of
      intensified political life the proletariat can obtain more revolutionary
      training than in several years of political calm. For this reason the
      tendency of the above-mentioned socialists consciously or

    

      unconsciously to restrict the scope and content of political’
      agitation is particularly harmful.
    

      Let us recall also the words that the Communists support every
      revolutionary movement against the existing system. Those words are often
      interpreted too narrowly, and are not taken to imply support for the
      liberal opposition. It must not be forgotten, however, that there are
      periods when every conflict with the government arising out of progressive
      social interests, however small, may under certain conditions (of
      which our support is one) flare up into a general
      conflagration. Suffice it to recall the great social movement which
      developed in Russia out of the struggle between the students and the
      government over academic

      demands,[5]

      or the conflict that arose in France between all the progressive elements
      and the militarists over a trial in which the verdict had been rendered on
      the basis of forged

      evidence.[6]

      Hence, it is our bounden duty to explain to the proletariat every liberal
      and democratic protest, to widen and support it, with the active
      participation of the workers, be it a conflict between the Zemstvo and the
      Ministry of the Interior, between the nobility and the police
      régime of the Orthodox Church, between statisticians and the
      bureaucrats, between peasants and the “Zemstvo” officials,
      between religious sects and the rural police, etc., etc. Those who
      contemptuously turn up their noses at the slight importance of some of
      these conflicts, or at the “hopelessness” of the attempts to
      fan them into a general conflagration, do not realise that all-sided
      political agitation is a focus in which the vital interests of political
      education of the proletariat coincide with the vital interests of social
      development as a whole, of the entire people, that is, of all its
      democratic elements. It is our direct duty to concern ourselves with every
      liberal question, to determine our Social-Democratic attitude towards it,
      to help the proletariat to take an active part in its solution and to
      accomplish the solution in its own, proletarian way. Those who refrain
      from concerning themselves in this way (whatever their intentions) in
      actuality leave the liberals in command, place in their hands the
      political education of the workers, and concede the hegemony in the
      political struggle to elements which, in the final analysis, are leaders
      of bourgeois democracy.
    
 

      The class character of the Social-Democratic movement must not be
      expressed in the restriction of our tasks to the direct and immediate
      needs of the “labour movement pure and simple”. It must be
      expressed in our leadership of every aspect and every manifestation of the
      great struggle for liberation that is being waged by the proletariat, the
      only truly revolutionary class in modern society. Social-Democracy must
      constantly and unswervingly spread the influence of the labour movement to
      all spheres of the social and political life of contemporary society. It
      must lead, not only the economic, but also the political, struggle of the
      proletariat. It must never for a moment lose sight of our ultimate goal,
      but always carry on propaganda for the proletarian ideology —the
      theory of scientific socialism, viz., Marxism—guard it against
      distortion, and develop it further. We must untiringly combat any and
      every bourgeois ideology, regardless of the fashionable and striking garb
      in which it may drape itself. The socialists we have mentioned above
      depart from the “class” point of view also because, and to the
      extent that, they remain indifferent to the task of combating the
      “criticism of Marxism”. Only the blind fail to see that this
      “criticism” has taken root more rapidly in Russia than in any
      other country, and has been more enthusiastically taken up by Russian
      liberal propaganda than by any other, precisely for the reason that it is
      one of the elements of the bourgeois (now consciously bourgeois) democracy
      now information in Russia.
    

      It is particularly in regard to the political struggle that the
      “class point of view” demands that the proletariat give an
      impetus to every democratic movement. The political demands of
      working-class democracy do not differ in principle from those of
      bourgeois democracy, they differ only in degree. In the struggle for
      economic emancipation, for the socialist revolution, the proletariat
      stands on a basis different in principle and it stands alone (the small
      producer will come to its aid only to the extent that he enters, or is
      preparing to enter, its ranks). In the struggle for political liberation,
      however, we have many allies, towards whom we must not remain
      indifferent. But while our allies in the bourgeois-democratic camp, in
      struggling for liberal reforms, will always glance back and seek to adjust
      matters

    

      so that they will be able, as before, “to eat well, sleep peace
      fully, and live merrily” at other people’s expense, the proletariat
      will march forward to the end, without looking back. While the confreres
      of R. N. S. (author of the preface to Witte’s Memorandum) haggle
      with the government over the rights of the authoritative Zemstvo, or over
      a constitution, we will struggle for the democratic republic. We will not
      forget, however, that if we want to push someone forward, we must
      continuously keep our hands on that someone’s shoulders. The party of the
      proletariat must learn to catch every liberal just at the moment when he
      is prepared to move forward an inch, and make him move forward a yard. If
      he is obdurate, we will go forward without him and over him.

in 1899. The authors, who espoused “Economist” views, denied
the necessity of establishing an independent working-class political
party and believed that a political revolution could be accomplished by
means of a general strike, without the preliminary organisation and
preparation of the masses and without an armed uprising.

      provocative trial was organised by French reactionary circles. The general
      movement for the defence of Dreyfus that developed in France exposed the
      corruption of the court and sharpened the struggle between republicans and
      royalists. In 1899 Dreyfus was pardoned and released. It was not until
      1906, after a fresh examination of the case, that Dreyfus was
      rehabilitated.

      The following letter has been received by the Editorial
      Board:
    


      “In dealing with the question of agitation (if I am not mistaken, in
      No. 13) Iskra opposes agitational leaflets (pamphlets of two or
      three pages) on political subjects. In the opinion of the editors, news
      papers can successfully replace such literature. Newspapers are, of
      course, a fine thing. Nobody would dream of disputing that. But can they
      replace leaflets that are specially intended for widespread distribution
      among the masses? The editors have received a letter from Russia in which
      a group of workers-agitators gave their opinion on this
      subject. Iskra’s reply is obviously due to a
      misunderstanding. The question of agitation is as important today as the
      question of demonstrations. It is, therefore, to be desired that the
      editors raise this question once again and on this occasion devote to it
      greater attention.
    

      “A Reader”
    


      Anyone who takes the trouble to read our reply to the letter from
      “Southern Workers” in No. 13 of

      Iskra[See present volume,
p. 326.—Ed.]

      together with this letter will easily convince himself that it is
      precisely the author of the letter who labours under an obvious
      misunderstanding. There was no question of Iskra’s
      “opposing agitational leaflets”; it never entered anyone’s
      head that a newspaper could “replace leaflets”. Our
      correspondent did not notice that leaflets are in fact proclamations. Such
      literature as proclamations cannot be replaced by anything and
      will always be absolutely essential—on this point the
      “Southern Workers” and Iskra are in full accord. But
      they are also agreed that this type of literature is not
      sufficient. If we speak of good housing for the workers and at the
      same time say that good food is not enough

    

      for them, that would hardly be taken to mean that we are against”
      good food. The question is—which is the highest form of
      agitational literature? The “Southern Workers”
      did not say a word about the newspaper when they raised
      this question. Their silence could, of course, have been due to local
      circumstances, but we, although we did not in the least wish to enter into
      “disputes” with our correspondents, naturally could not
      refrain from reminding them that the proletariat should also organise its
      own newspaper just as the other classes of the population have done, that
      fragmentary work alone is not enough, and that the regular, active, and
      general work of all localities for a revolutionary organ is essential.
    

      As far as the three- or four-page pamphlets are concerned, we did not
speak “against” them in the least, but merely
doubted the practicability of a plan to develop them into
regular literature distributed “simultaneously through
out Russia”. If they consist of three or four pages, they will be,
essentially, only proclamations. In all parts of Russia we have many
very good proclamations that are not in the least heavy reading, both
student and workers’ proclamations, that sometimes run to six or eight
small pages. A really popular pamphlet, capable of
explaining even one single question to a completely unprepared
worker, would probably be much bigger in size and there would be no need
and no possibility of distributing it “simultaneously throughout
Russia” (since it is not only of topical significance). Fully
recognising, as we do, every variety of political literature, old and
new, so long as it is really good political literature, we would advise
working, not upon an invention of a midway type of agitational
medium— something between leaflet and popular pamphlet, but for a
revolutionary organ that really deserves the name of periodical
(appearing, not once, but at least two or four times, a month) and which
is an All-Russian organ.

  Lenin’s work What Is To Be Done? was written at the end of
  1901 and early in 1902. In “Where To Begin”, published in Iskra,
  No. 4 (May 1901), Lenin said that the article represented “a skeleton plan
  to be developed in greater detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for
  print”.  


  Lenin began the actual writing of the book in the autumn of 1901. In
  his “Preface to the Pamphlet Documents of the ‘Unity’
  Conference”, written in November 1901, Lenin said that the book was
  in preparation “to be published in the near future”. In December Lenin
  published (in Iskra, No. 12) his article “A Talk with Defenders
  of Economism”, which he later called a conspectus of What Is To Be
  Done? He wrote the Preface to the book in February 1902 and early in
  March the book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart. An announcement of its
  publication was printed in Iskra, No. 18, March 10, 1902.  


  In republishing the book in 1907 as part of the collection Twelve
  Years, Lenin omitted Section A of Chapter V, “Who Was Offended by the
  Article ‘Where To Begin,’” stating in the Preface that the book
  was being published with slight abridgements, representing the omission
  solely of details of the organisational relationships and minor polemical
  remarks. Lenin added five footnotes to the new edition.  


  The text of this volume is that of the 1902 edition, verified with the
  1907 edition.

Lenin's What Is To Be Done?: Preface








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
What Is To Be Done?
BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT





  “...Party struggles lend a party strength and vitality; the greatest
  proof of a party’s weakness is its diffuseness
  and the blurring of clear demarcations; a party becomes stronger by 
  purging itself...”

(From a letter of Lassalle to Marx, of June 24, 1852)



•
Preface

According to the author’s original plan, the present pamphlet
    was to have been devoted to a detailed development of the ideas
    expressed in the article “Where To Begin”, (Iskra,
No. 4, May 1901).[1]
We must first apologise to the reader
    for the delay in fulfilling the promise made in that article (and
    repeated in response to many private inquiries and letters). One
    of the reasons for this delay was the attempt, undertaken in June
    of the past year (1901), to unite all the Social-Democratic
    organisations abroad. It was natural to wait for the results of
    this attempt, for, had the effort proved successful, it would
    perhaps have been necessary to expound Iskra’s
conceptions of organisation from a somewhat different
    approach; in any case, such a success promised to put an end very
    quickly to the existence of the two trends in the Russian
    Social-Democratic movement. As the reader knows, the attempt
    failed,  and, as we propose to show, was bound to fail after the
    new swing, of Rabocheye Dyelo, in its issue No. 10,
    towards Economism. It was found to be absolutely essential to
    begin a determined struggle against this trend, diffuse and
    ill-defined, but for that reason the more persistent, the more
    capable of reasserting itself in diverse forms. Accordingly, the
    original plan of the pamphlet was altered and considerably
    enlarged.
Its main theme was to have been the three questions raised in
    the article “Where To Begin” – the character and main content of
    our political agitation; our organisational tasks; and the plan
    for building, simultaneously and from various sides, a militant,
    all-Russia organisation. These questions have long engaged the
    mind of the author, who

  

tried to raise them in Rabochaya
    Gazeta[3] during one of the 
unsuccessful attempts to revive that
    paper (see Chapter V). But the original plan to confine the
    pamphlet to an analysis of only these three questions and to set
    forth our views as far as possible in a positive form, without, or
    almost without, entering into polemics, proved wholly
    impracticable, for two reasons. On the one hand, Economism proved
    to be much more tenacious than we had supposed (we employ the term
    Economism in the broad sense, as explained in Iskra,
No. 12 (December 1901), in the article entitled “A Talk With
    Defenders of Economism”, which was a synopsis, so to speak, of the
    present pamphlet[2]).
It became clear beyond doubt that
    the differences regarding the solution of the three questions
    mentioned were explainable to a far greater degree by the basic
    antithesis between the two trends in the Russian Social-Democratic
    movement than by differences over details. On the other hand, the
    perplexity of the Economists over the practical application of our
    views in Iskra clearly revealed that we often speak
    literally in different tongues and therefore cannot
arrive at an understanding without beginning ab ovo,
    and that an attempt must be made, in the simplest possible
    style, illustrated by numerous and concrete examples,
    systematically to “clarify” all our basic points of
    difference with all the Economists. I resolved to make
    such an attempt at “clarification”, fully realising that it would
    greatly increase the size of the pamphlet and delay its
    publication; I saw no other way of meeting my pledge I
    had made in the article “Where To Begin”. Thus, to the apologies
    for the delay, I must add others for the serious literary
    shortcomings of the pamphlet. I had to work in great haste,
with frequent interruptions by a variety of other tasks.
The examination of the above three questions still constitutes
    the main theme of this pamphlet, but I found it necessary to begin
    with two questions of a more general nature – why such an
    “innocent” and “natural” slogan as “freedom
of criticism” should be for us a veritable war-cry, and why we cannot
come to an understanding even on the fundamental question of the role of
    Social-Democrats in

  

relation to the spontaneous mass
    movement. Further, the exposition of our views on the character
    and substance of political agitation developed into an explanation
    of the difference between trade-unionist politics and
    Social-Democratic politics, while the exposition of our views on
    organisational tasks developed into an explanation of the
    difference between the amateurish methods which satisfy the
    Economists, and the organisation of revolutionaries which we hold
    to be indispensable. Further, I advance the “plan” for an
    all-Russia political newspaper with all the more insistence
    because the objections raised against it are untenable, and
    because no real answer has been given to the question I raised in
    the article “Where To Begin” as to how we can set to work from
    all sides simultaneously to create the organisation we
    need. Finally, in the concluding part, I hope to show that we did
    all we could to prevent a decisive break with the Economists, a
    break which nevertheless proved inevitable; that Rabocheye
    Dyelo acquired a special significance, a “historical”
    significance, if you will, because it expressed fully and
    strikingly, not consistent Economism, but the confusion and
    vacillation which constitute the distinguishing feature of an
    entire period in the history of Russian Social-Democracy; and
    that therefore the polemic with Rabocheye Dyelo, which
    may upon first view seem excessively detailed, also acquires
    significance, for we can make no progress until we have completely
    put an end to this period.
N. Lenin
February 1902

## Dogmatism and “Freedom of Criticism”





Lenin's What Is To Be Done?: Dogmatism And 'Freedom of Criticism'








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
What Is To Be Done?
BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT

I
Dogmatism And “Freedom of Criticism”

A. What Does “Freedom of Criticism” Mean?

      “Freedom of criticism” is undoubtedly the most fashionable
      slogan at the present time, and the one most frequently employed
      in the controversies between socialists and democrats in all
      countries. At first sight, nothing would appear to be more
      strange than the solemn appeals to freedom of criticism made by
      one of the parties to the dispute. Have voices been raised in
      the advanced parties against the constitutional law of the
      majority of European countries which guarantees freedom to
      science and scientific investigation? “Something must be wrong
      here,” will be the comment of the onlooker who has heard this
      fashionable slogan repeated at every turn but has not yet
      penetrated the essence of the disagreement among the disputants;
      evidently this slogan is one of the conventional phrases which,
      like nicknames, become legitimised by use, and become almost
      generic terms.”
    

      In fact, it is no secret for anyone that two trends have taken
      form in present-day international[1]
[1]

      Incidentally, in the history of modern socialism this is a
      phenomenon, perhaps unique and in its way very consoling,
      namely, that the strife of the various trends within the
      socialist movement has from national become
      international. Formerly, the disputes between Lassalleans and

      Eisenachers,[24] between Guesdists and

  Possibilists,[25] between Fabians
      and Social-Democrats, and between Narodnaya Volya adherents and
      Social-Democrats, remained confined within purely national
      frameworks, reflecting purely national features, and proceeding,
      as it were, on different planes. At the present time (as is now
      evident), the English Fabians, the French Ministerialists, the

   

      German Bernsteinians, and the Russian Critics – all belong to
      the same family, all extol each other, learn from each other,
      and together take up arms against “dogmatic” Marxism. In this
      first really international battle with socialist opportunism,
      international revolutionary Social-Democracy will perhaps become
      sufficiently strengthened to put an end to the political
      reaction that has long reigned in Europe?
    —Lenin

 

      Social-Democracy.

   

  The conflict
      between these trends now flares up in a bright flame and now
      dies down and smoulders under the ashes of imposing “truce
      resolutions”. The essence of the “new” trend, which adopts a
      “critical” attitude towards “obsolete dogmatic” Marxism, has
      been clearly enough presented by Bernstein and
      demonstrated by Millerand.
    

      Social-Democracy must change from a party of social revolution
      into a democratic party of social reforms. Bernstein has
      surrounded this political demand with a whole battery of
      well-attuned “new” arguments and reasonings. Denied was the
      possibility of putting socialism on a scientific basis and of
      demonstrating its necessity and inevitability from the point of
      view of the materialist conception of history. Denied was the
      fact of growing impoverishment, the process of proletarisation,
      and the intensification of capitalist contradictions; the very
      concept, “ultimate aim”, was declared to be unsound,
      and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was
      completely rejected. Denied was the antithesis in principle
      between liberalism and socialism. Denied was the theory of
      the class struggle, on the alleged grounds that it could
      not be applied to a strictly democratic society governed
      according to the will of the majority, etc.
    

      Thus, the demand for a decisive turn from revolutionary
      Social-Democracy to bourgeois social-reformism was accompanied
      by a no less decisive turn towards bourgeois criticism of all
      the fundamental ideas of Marxism. In view of the fact that this
      criticism of Marxism has long been directed from the political
      platform, from university chairs, in numerous pamphlets and in a
      series of learned treatises, in view of the fact that the entire
      younger generation of the educated classes has been
      systematically reared for decades on this criticism, it is not
      surprising that the “new critical” trend in Social-Democracy
      should spring up, all

   

  complete, like Minerva from the head of
      Jove. The content of this new trend did not have to grow and
      take shape, it was transferred bodily from bourgeois to
      socialist literature.
    

      To proceed. If Bernstein’s theoretical criticism and political
      yearnings were still unclear to anyone, the French took the
      trouble strikingly to demonstrate the “new method”. In this
      instance, too, France has justified its old reputation of being
      “the land where, more than anywhere else, the historical class
      struggles were each time fought out to a decision...” (Engels,
      Introduction to Marx’s Der 18

  Brumaire).[12] The French
      socialists have begun, not to theorise, but to act. The
      democratically more highly developed political conditions in
      France have permitted them to put “Bernsteinism into practice”
      immediately, with all its consequences. Millerand has furnished
      an excellent example of practical Bernsteinism; not without
      reason did Bernstein and Vollmar rush so zealously to defend and
      laud him. Indeed, if Social-Democracy, in essence, is merely a
      party of reform and must be bold enough to admit this openly,
      then not only has a socialist the right to join a bourgeois
      cabinet, but he must always strive to do so. If democracy, in
      essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why
      should not a socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world
      by orations on class collaboration? Why should he not remain in
      the cabinet even after the shooting-down of workers by gendarmes
      has exposed, for the hundredth and thousandth time, the real
      nature of the democratic collaboration of classes? Why should he
      not personally take part in greeting the tsar, for whom the
      French socialists now have no other name than hero of the
      gallows, knout, and exile (knouteur, pendeur et
      deportateur)? And the reward for this utter humiliation and
      self-degradation of socialism in the face of the whole world,
      for the corruption of the socialist consciousness of the working
      masses – the only basis that can guarantee our victory – the
      reward for this is pompous projects for miserable
      reforms, so miserable in fact that much more has been obtained
      from bourgeois governments!
    

      He who does not deliberately close his eyes cannot fail to see
      that the new “critical” trend in socialism is nothing more nor
      less than a new variety of opportunism. And if we judge
      people, not by the glittering uniforms they don or

   

  by the highsounding appellations they give themselves, but by their
      actions and by what they actually advocate, it will be clear
      that “freedom of criticism” means’ freedom for an opportunist
      trend in Social-Democracy, freedom to convert Social-Democracy
      into a democratic party of reform, freedom to introduce
      bourgeois ideas and bourgeois elements into socialism.
    

      “Freedom” is a grand word, but under the banner of freedom for
      industry the most predatory wars were waged, under the banner of
      freedom of labour, the working people were robbed. The modern
      use of the term “freedom of criticism” contains the same
      inherent falsehood. Those who are really convinced that they
      have made progress in science would not demand freedom for the
      new views to continue side by side with the old, but the
      substitution of the new views for the old. The cry heard today,
      “Long live freedom of criticism”, is too strongly reminiscent of
      the fable of the empty barrel.
    

      We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and
      difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are
      surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance
      almost constantly under their fire. We have combined, by a
      freely adopted decision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy,
      and not of retreating into the neighbouring marsh, the
      inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us
      with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with
      having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of
      conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let us go
      into the marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort:
      What backward people you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the
      liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen!
      You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves
      wherever you will, even into the marsh. In fact, we think that
      the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render
      you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands,
      don’t clutch at us and don’t besmirch the grand word freedom,
      for we too are “free” to go where we please, free to fight not
      only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning
      towards the marsh!
    


B. The New Advocates of “Freedom of Criticism”
    

      Now, this slogan (“freedom of criticism”) has in recent times
      been solemnly advanced by Rabocheye Dyelo (No. 10),
      organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, not as a
      theoretical postulate, but as a political demand, as a reply to
      the question, “Is it possible to unite the Social-Democratic
      organisations operating abroad?”: “For a durable unity, there
      must be freedom of criticism” (p. 36).
    

      From this statement two definite conclusions follow: (1) that
      Rabocheye Dyelo has taken under its wing the
      opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy in general,
      and (2) that Rabocheye Dyelo demands freedom for
      opportunism in Russian Social-Democracy. Let us examine these
      conclusions.
    

Rabocheye Dyelo is “particularly” displeased with the
      “inclination of Iskra and Zarya to predict a
      rupture between the Mountain and the Gironde
      in international Social-Democracy”.[2]



      “Generally speaking,” writes B. Krichevsky, editor of
      Rabocheye Dyelo, “this talk of the Mountain
      and the Gironde heard in the ranks of
      Social-Democracy represents a shallow historical analogy, a
      strange thing to come from the pen of a Marxist. The Mountain
      and the Gironde did not represent different temperaments-, or
      intellectual trends, as the historians of social thought may
      think, but different classes or strata – the middle
      bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat, on the other. In the modern socialist movement,
      however, there is no conflict of class interests; the socialist
      movement in its entirety, in all of its diverse forms
      (Krichevsky’s italics), including the most pronounced
      Bernsteinians, stands on the basis of the class interests of the
      proletariat and its class struggle for political and economic
      emancipation” (pp. 32-33).
    



      A bold assertion! Has not Krichevsky heard of the fact, long ago
      noted, that it is precisely the extensive participation of an
      “academic” stratum in the socialist movement in recent
      years that has promoted such a rapid spread of Bernsteinism? And
      what is most important – on what does our author found his
      opinion that even “the most pronounced Bernsteinians” stand on
      the basis of the class struggle for the political and economic
      emancipation of the proletariat? No one knows. This determined
      defence of the most pronounced Bernsteinians is not supported by
      any argument or reasoning whatever. Apparently, the author
      believes that if he repeats what the most pronounced
      Bernsteinians say about themselves his assertion requires no
      proof. But can anything more “shallow” be imagined than this
      judgement of an entire trend based on nothing more than what the
      representatives of that trend say about themselves? Can anything
      more shallow be imagined than the subsequent “homily” on the two
      different and even diametrically opposite types, or paths, of
      party development? (Rabocheye Dyelo, pp. 34-35.) The
      German Social-Democrats, in other words, recognise complete
      freedom  of criticism, but the French do not, and it is
      precisely their example that demonstrates the “bane of
      intolerance”.
    

      To this we can only say that the very example B. Krichevsky
      affords us attests to the fact that the name Marxists is at
      times assumed by people who conceive history literally in the
      “Ilovaisky

  manner”.[13] To explain the unity 
  of the German Socialist
      Party and the disunity of the French Socialist Party, there is
      no need whatever to go into the special features in the history
      of these countries, to contrast the conditions of military
      semiabsolutism in the one with republican parliamentarism in the
      other, to analyse the effects of the Paris Commune and the
      effects of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists, to
      compare the economic life and economic development of the two
      countries, or to recall that “the unexampled growth of German
      Social-Democracy” was accompanied by a strenuous struggle,
      unique in the history of socialism, not only against erroneous
      theories (Mühlberger,

  Dühring,[3]
 

   the Katheder-Socialists[14]),

   

  but also against erroneous
      tactics (Lassalle), etc., etc. All that is superfluous! The
      French quarrel among themselves because they are intolerant; the
      Germans are united because they are good boys.
    

      And observe, this piece of matchless profundity is designed to
      “refute” the fact that puts to rout the defence of the
      Bernsteinians. The question whether or not the Bernsteinians
      stand on the basis of the class struggle of the
      proletariat is one that can be completely and irrevocably
      answered only by historical experience. Consequently, the
      example of France holds greatest significance in this respect,
      because France is the only country in which the Bernsteinians
      attempted to stand independently, on their own feet,
      with the warm approval of their German colleagues (and partly
      also of the Russian opportunists; cf. Rabocheye Dyelo,
      No. 2-3, pp. 83-84). The reference to the “intolerance” of the
      French, apart from its “historical” significance (in the

      Nozdryov[15] sense), turns out to
  be merely an attempt to –hush up
      very unpleasant facts with angry invectives.
    

      Nor are we inclined to make a present of the Germans to
      Krichevsky and the numerous other champions of “freedom of
      criticism”. If the “most pronounced Bernsteinians” are still
      tolerated in the ranks of the German party, it is only to the
      extent that they submit to the Hanover

  resolution,[16]
      which emphatically rejected Bernstein’s “amendments”, and to the
      Lubeck resolution, which (notwithstanding the diplomatic terms
      in which it is couched) contains a direct warning to
      Bernstein. It is debatable, from the

 

  standpoint of the interests
      of the German party, whether diplomacy was appropriate and
      whether, in this case, a bad peace is better than a good
      quarrel; in short, opinions may differ as to the expediency of
      any one of the methods employed to reject Bernsteinism,
      but that the German party did reject Bernsteinism on
      two occasions, is a fact no one can fail to see. Therefore, to
      think that the German example confirms the thesis that “the most
      pronounced Bernsteinians stand on the basis of the class
      struggle of the proletariat, for political and economic
      emancipation”, means to fail completely to understand what is
      going on under our very eyes.[4]


      Nor is that all. As we have seen, Rabocheye Dyelo
      demands “freedom of criticism” and defends Bernsteinism before
      Russian Social-Democracy. Apparently it convinced
      itself that we were unfair to our “Critics” and
      Bernsteinians. But to which ones? who? where? when? What did the
      unfairness represent? About this, not a word. Rabocheye
      Dyelo does not name a single Russian Critic or
      Bernsteinian!  We are left with but one of two possible
      suppositions. Either the unfairly treated party is none
      other than Rabocheye Dyelo itself (this is confirmed by
      the fact that in the two articles in No. 10 reference is made
      only to the wrongs suffered by Rabocheye Dyelo at the
      hands of Zarya and Iskra). If that

 

  is the case, how is the strange fact to be explained that Rabocheye
      Dyelo, which always vehemently dissociated itself from all
      solidarity with Bernsteinism, could not defend itself without
      putting in a word in defence of the “most pronounced
      Bernsteinians” and of freedom of criticism? Or some third
      persons have been treated unfairly. if this is the case, then
      what reasons may there be for not naming them?
    

      We see, therefore, that Rabocheye Dyelo is continuing
      to play the game of hide-and-seek it has played (as we shall
      show below) ever since its founding. And let us note further
      this first practical application of the vaunted
      “freedom of criticism”. In actual fact, not only was it
      forthwith reduced to abstention from all criticism, but also to
      abstention from expressing independent views altogether. The
      very Rabocheye Dyelo, which avoids mentioning Russian
      Bernsteinism as if it were a shameful disease (to use

  Starover’s[17]
      apt expression), proposes, for the treatment of this disease, to
      copy word for word the latest German prescription for the German
      variety of the malady! Instead of freedom of criticism slavish
      (worse: apish) imitation! The very same social and political
      content of modern international opportunism reveals itself in a
      variety of ways according to national peculiarities. In one
      country the opportunists have long ago come out under a separate
      flag; in another, they have ignored theory and in fact pursued
      the policy of the Radicals-Socialists; in a third, some members
      of the revolutionary party have deserted to the camp of
      opportunism and strive to achieve their aims, not in open
      struggle for principles and for new tactics, but by gradual,
      imperceptible, and, if one may so put it, unpunishable
      corruption of their party; in a fourth country, similar
      deserters employ the same methods in the gloom of political
      slavery, and with a completely original combination of “legal”
      and “illegal” activity, etc. To talk of freedom of criticism and
      of Bernsteinism as a condition for uniting the Russian
      Social Democrats and not to explain how Russian
      Bernsteinism has manifested itself and what particular
      fruits it has borne, amounts to talking with the aim of saying
      nothing.
    

      Let us ourselves try, if only in a  few words, to say what
      Rabocheye Dyelo did not want to say (or which was,
      perhaps, beyond its comprehension).
    



      C. Criticism in Russia
    

      The chief distinguishing feature of Russia in regard to the
      point we are examining is that the very beginning of
      the spontaneous working-class movement, on the one hand, and of
      the turn of progressive public opinion towards Marxism, on the
      other, was marked by the combination of manifestly heterogeneous
      elements under a common flag to fight the common enemy (the
      obsolete social and political world outlook). We refer to the
      heyday of “legal Marxism”. Speaking generally, this was an
      altogether curious phenomenon that no one in the eighties or the
      beginning of the nineties would have believed possible. In a
      country ruled by an autocracy, with a completely enslaved press,
      in a period of desperate political reaction in which even the
      tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest is
      persecuted, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forces
      its way into the censored literature and, though
      expounded in Aesopian language, is understood by all the
      “interested”. The government had accustomed itself to regarding
      only the theory of the (revolutionary) Narodnaya Volya as
      dangerous, without, as is usual, observing its internal
      evolution, and rejoicing at any criticism levelled against
      it. Quite a considerable time elapsed (by our Russian standards)
      before the government realised what had happened and the
      unwieldy army of censors and gendarmes discovered the new enemy
      and flung itself upon him. Meanwhile, Marxist books were
      published one after another, Marxist journals and newspapers
      were founded, nearly everyone became a Marxist, Marxists were
      flattered, Marxists were courted, and the book publishers
      rejoiced at the extraordinary, ready sale of Marxist literature.
      It was quite natural, therefore, that among the Marxian
      neophytes who were caught up in this atmosphere, there should be
      more than one “author who got a swelled head...”[18]


      We can now speak calmly of this period as of an event of the
      past. It is no secret that the brief period in which Marxism
      blossomed on the surface of our literature was called forth by
      an alliance between people of extreme and of very moderate
      views. In point of fact, the latter were bourgeois democrats;
      this conclusion (so markedly confirmed by their

 

  subsequent
      “critical” development) suggested itself to some even when the
      “alliance” was still intact.[5]


      That being the case, are not the revolutionary Social-Democrats
      who entered into the alliance with the future “Critics” mainly
      responsible for the subsequent “confusion”? This question,
      together with a reply in the affirmative, is sometimes heard
      from people with too rigid a view. But such people are entirely
      in the wrong. Only those who are not sure of themselves can fear
      to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people;
      not a single political party could exist without such
      alliances. The combination with the legal Marxists was in its
      way the first really political alliance entered into by Russian
      Social -Democrats. Thanks to this alliance, an astonishingly
      rapid victory was obtained over Narodism, and Marxist ideas
      (even though in a vulgarised form) became very
      widespread. Moreover, the alliance was not concluded altogether
      without  “conditions”. Evidence of this is the burning by the
      censor, in 1895, of the Marxist collection Material on the
      Question of the Economic Development of Russia.[19] 
  If the literary agreement with the legal Marxists can be compared with
      a political alliance, then that book can be compared with a
      political treaty.
    

      The rupture, of course, did not occur because the “allies”
      proved to be bourgeois democrats. On the contrary, the
      representatives of the latter trend are natural and desirable
      allies of Social-Democracy insofar as its democratic tasks,
      brought to the fore by the prevailing situation in Russia, are
      concerned. But an essential condition for such an alliance must
      be the full opportunity for the socialists to reveal to the
      working class that its interests are diametrically opposed to
      the interests of the bourgeoisie. However, the Bernsteinian and
      “critical” trend, to which the majority of the legal Marxists
      turned, deprived the socialists of this opportunity and
      demoralised the socialist consciousness by vulgarising Marxism,
      by advocating the theory of the blunting of social
      contradictions, by declaring the idea of the

 

  social revolution
      and of the dictatorship of the proletariat  to be absurd, by
      reducing the working-class movement and the class struggle to
      narrow trade-unionism and to a “realistic” struggle for petty,
      gradual reforms. This was synonymous with bourgeois democracy’s
      denial of socialism’s right to independence and, consequently,
      of its right to existence; in practice it meant a striving to
      convert the nascent working-class movement into an appendage of
      the liberals.
    

      Naturally, under such circumstances the rupture was
      necessary. But the “peculiar” feature of Russia manifested
      itself in the fact that this rupture simply meant the
      elimination of the Social-Democrats from the most accessible and
      widespread “legal” literature. The “ex-Marxists”, who took up
      the flag of “criticism” and who obtained almost a monopoly to
      "demolish Marxism, entrenched themselves in this
      literature. Catchwords like “Against orthodoxy” and “Long live
      freedom of criticism” (now repeated by Rabocheye Dyelo)
      forthwith became the vogue, and the fact that neither the censor
      nor the gendarmes could resist this vogue is apparent from the
      publication of three Russian editions of the work of
      the celebrated Bernstein (celebrated in the Herostratean sense)
      and from the fact that the works of Bernstein, Mr. Prokopovich,
      and others were recommended by Zubatov (Iskra,
      No. 10). A task now devolved upon the Social Democrats that was
      difficult in itself and was made incredibly more difficult by
      purely external obstacles – the task of combating the new
      trend. This trend did not confine itself to the sphere of
      literature. The turn towards “criticism” was accompanied by an
      infatuation for Economism among Social-Democratic practical
      workers.
    

      The manner in which the connection between, and interdependence
      of, legal criticism and illegal Economism arose and grew is in
      itself an interesting subject, one that could serve as the theme
      of a special article. We need only note here that this
      connection undoubtedly existed. The notoriety deservedly
      acquired by the Credo was due precisely to the
      frankness with which it formulated this connection and blurted
      out the fundamental political tendency of Economism – let the
      workers carry on the economic struggle (it would be more correct
      to say the trade unionist struggle,

 

  because the latter also
      embraces specifically working class politics) and let the
      Marxist intelligentsia merge with the liberals for the political
      “struggle.” Thus, trade-unionist work “among the people” meant
      fulfilling the first part of this task, while legal criticism
      meant fulfilling the second. This statement was such an
      excellent weapon against Economism that, had there been no
      Credo, it would have been worth inventing one.
    

      The Credo was not invented, but it was published without the
      consent and perhaps even against the will of its authors.  At
      all events, the present writer, who took part in dragging this
      new “programme” into the light of day,[6]

   has heard complaints
      and reproaches to the effect that copies of the resume of the
      speakers’ views were distributed, dubbed the Credo, and
      even published in the press together with the protest! We refer
      to this episode because it reveals a very peculiar feature of
      our Economism – fear of publicity. This is a feature of
      Economism generally, and not of the authors of the Credo
      alone. It was revealed by that most outspoken and honest
      advocate of Economism, Rabochaya Mysl, and by
      Rabocheye Dyelo (which was indignant over the
      publication of “Economist” documents in the

  Vademecum[20]), as well
      as by the Kiev Committee, which two years ago refused to permit
      the publication of its profession de foi,[7]

  together with a repudiation of it,[8]

   and by many other individual
      representatives of Economism.
    

      This fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom of
      criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness (although,
      on occasion, no doubt craftiness is brought into play: it would
      be improvident to expose the young and as

 

  yet frail shoots of
      the new trend. to attacks by opponents). No, the majority of the
      Economists look with sincere resentment (as by the very nature
      of Economism they must) upon all theoretical controversies,
      factional disagreements, broad political questions, plans for
      organising revolutionaries, etc. “Leave all that to the people
      abroad!” said a fairly consistent Economist to me one day,
      thereby expressing a very widespread (and again purely
      trade-unionist) view; our concern is the working-class movement,
      the workers, organisations here, in our localities; all the rest
      is merely the invention of doctrinaires, “the overrating of
      ideology”, as the authors of the letter, published in
      Iskra, No. 12, expressed it, in unison with
      Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10.
    

      The question now arises: such being the peculiar features of
      Russian “criticism” and Russian Bernsteinism, what should have
      been the task of those who sought to oppose opportunism in deeds
      and not merely in words? First, they should have made efforts to
      resume the theoretical work that had barely begun in the period
      of legal Marxism and that fell anew on the shoulders of the
      comrades working underground. Without such work the successful
      growth of the movement was impossible. Secondly, they should
      have actively combated the legal “criticism” that was perverting
      people’s minds on a considerable scale. Thirdly, they should
      have actively opposed confusion and vacillation in the practical
      movement, exposing and repudiating every conscious or
      unconscious attempt to degrade our programme and our tactics.
    

      That Rabocheye Dyelo did none of these things is well
      known; we shall have occasion below to deal with this well-known
      fact in detail and from various aspects. At the moment, however,
      we desire merely to show the glaring contradiction that exists
      between the demand for “freedom of criticism” and the specific
      features of our native criticism and Russian Economism. It
      suffices but to glance at the text of the resolution in which
      the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad endorsed the point
      of view of Rabocheye Dyelo.
    


      “In the interests of the further ideological development of
      Social-Democracy, we recognise the freedom of criticism of
      Social-Democratic theory in Party literature to be absolutely
      necessary insofar as the criticism does not run counter to the
      class and revolutionary character of this theory” (Two
      Conferences, p. 10).
    



      And the motivation? The resolution “in its first part coincides
      with the resolution of the Lubeck Party Congress on
      Bernstein”. . . . In the simplicity of their souls the
      “Unionists” failed to observe what a testimonium
      paupertatis (attestation of poverty) they betray with this
      copying. . .. “But ... in its second part, it restricts freedom
      of criticism much more than did the Lubeck Party Congress.”
    

      The resolution of the Union Abroad, then, is directed against
      the Russian Bernsteinians? If it is not, then the reference to
      Lubeck would be utterly absurd. But it is not true to say that
      it “restricts freedom of criticism”. In adopting their Hanover
      resolution, the Germans, point by point, rejected precisely
      the amendments proposed by Bernstein, while in their Lubeck
      resolution they cautioned Bernstein personally, by
      naming him. Our “free” imitators, however, make not a single
      allusion to a single manifestation of specifically
      Russian “criticism” and Russian Economism. In view of this
      omission, the bare reference to the class and revolutionary
      character of the theory leaves far wider scope for
      misinterpretation, particularly when the Union Abroad refuses to
      identify “so-called Economism” with opportunism (Two
      Conferences, p. 8, Paragraph 1). But all this, in
      passing. The main thing to note is that the positions of the
      opportunists in relation to the revolutionary Social-Democrats
      in Russia are diametrically opposed to those in Germany. In that
      country, as we know, the revolutionary Social-Democrats are in
      favour of preserving that which exists – the old programme and
      the tactics, which are universally known and have been
      elucidated in all their details by many decades of
      experience. But the “Critics” desire to introduce changes, and
      since these Critics represent an insignificant minority, and
      since they are very timid in their revisionist efforts, one can
      understand the motives of the majority in confining themselves
      to the dry rejection of “innovations”. In Russia, however, it is
      the Critics and the Economists who are in favour of preserving
      that which exists: the “Critics” want us to go on regarding them
      as Marxists and to guarantee them the “freedom of criticism”
      they enjoyed to the full (for, in fact, they never recognised
      any kind of party ties,[9]
[9]
  The fact alone of the absence of public party ties and party
      traditions, representing as it does a cardinal difference
      between Russia

 

  and Germany, should have warned all sensible
      socialists against blind imitation. But here is an instance of
      the lengths to which “freedom of criticism” goes in
      Russia. Mr. Bulgakov, the Russian Critic, utters the following
      reprimand to the Austrian Critic, Hertz: “Notwithstanding the
      independence of his conclusions, Hertz on this point on the
      question of co-operative societies) apparently remains
      excessively bound by the opinions of his party, and although he
      disagrees with it in details, he dare not reject the common
      principle” (Capitalism and Agriculture, Vol. II,
      p. 287). The subject of a politically enslaved state, in which
      nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand of the population
      are corrupted to the marrow by political subservience and
      completely lack the conception of party honour and party ties,
      superciliously reproves a citizen of a constitutional state for
      being excessively “bound by the opinions of his party”! Our
      illegal organisations have nothing else to do, of course, but
      draw up resolutions on freedom of criticism....
      —Lenin


      and, moreover,

 

      we never had a
      generally recognised party body that could “restrict” freedom of
      criticism, if only by counsel); the Economists want the
      revolutionaries to recognise the sovereign character of the
      present movement" (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, p. 25),
      i.e., to recognise the “legitimacy” of that which exists; they
      want the “ideologists” not to try to “divert” the movement from
      the path that “is determined by the interaction of
      material. elements and material environment” (“Letter” in
      Iskra, No. 12); they want to have that struggle
      recognised as desirable “which it is possible for the workers to
      wage under the present conditions”, and as the only possible
      struggle, that “which they are actually waging at the present
      time” (“Separate Supplement” to Rabochaya
      Mysl, p. 14). We revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the
      contrary, are dissatisfied with this worship of spontaneity,
      i.e., of that which exists “at the present moment”. We demand
      that the tactics that have prevailed in recent years he changed;
      we declare that “before we can unite, and in order that we may
      unite, we must first of all draw firm and definite lines of
      demarcation” (see announcement of the publication of

      Iskra).[10]

  In a word, the Germans stand for that
      which exists and reject changes; we demand a change of that
      which exists, and reject subservience thereto and reconciliation
      to it.
    

      This “slight” difference our “free” copyists of German
      resolutions failed to notice.
    


 D. Engels On the Importance of the
     Theoretical Struggle
    

      “Dogmatism, doctrinairism”, “ossification of the party – the
      inevitable retribution that follows the violent strait-lacing of
      thought” – these are the enemies against which the knightly
      champions of “freedom of criticism” in Rabocheye Dyelo
      rise up in arms. We are very glad that this question has been
      placed on the order of the day and we would only propose to add
      to it one other:
    

      And who are the judges?
    

      We have before us two publishers’ announcements. One, “The
      Programme of the Periodical Organ of the Union of Russian Social
      Democrats Abroad – Rabocheye Dyelo” (reprint from
      No. 1 of Rabocheye Dyelo), and the other, the
      “Announcement of the Resumption of the Publications of the
      Emancipation of Labour Group”. Both are dated 1899, when the
      “crisis of Marxism” had long been under discussion. And what do
      we find? We would seek in vain in the first announcement for any
      reference to this phenomenon, or a definite statement of the
      position the new organ intends to adopt on this question. Not a
      word is said about theoretical work and the urgent tasks that
      now confront it, either in this programme or in the supplements
      to it that were adopted by the Third Congress of the Union
      Abroad in 1901 (Two Conferences, pp. 15-18). During
      this entire time the Editorial Board of Rabocheye Dyelo
      ignored theoretical questions, in spite of the fact that these
      were questions that disturbed the minds of all Social-Democrats
      the world over.
    

      The other announcement, on the contrary, points first of all to
      the declining interest in theory in recent years, imperatively
      demands “vigilant attention to the theoretical aspect of the
      revolutionary movement of the proletariat”, and calls for
      “ruthless criticism of the Bernsteinian and other
      anti-revolutionary tendencies” in our movement. The issues of
      Zarya to date show how this programme has been carried
      out.
    

      Thus, we see that high-sounding phrases against the ossification
      of thought, etc., conceal unconcern and helplessness with regard
      to the development of theoretical thought. The case of the
      Russian Social-Democrats manifestly illustrates

 

  the general
      European phenomenon (long ago noted also by the German Marxists)
      that the much vaunted freedom of criticism does not imply
      substitution of one theory for another, but freedom from all
      integral and pondered theory; it implies eclecticism and lack of
      principle. Those who have the slightest acquaintance with the
      actual state of our movement cannot but see that the wide spread
      of Marxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of the
      theoretical level. Quite a number of people with very little,
      and even a total lack of theoretical training joined the
      movement because of its practical significance and its practical
      successes. We can judge from that how tactless Rabocheye
      Dyelo is when, with an air of triumph, it quotes Marx’s
      statement: “Every step of real movement is more important than a
      dozen programmes.”[21] To repeat these words in a period of
      theoretical disorder is like wishing mourners at a funeral many
      happy returns of the day. Moreover, these words of Marx are
      taken from his letter on the Gotha

  Programme,[22] in which he
      sharply condemns eclecticism in the formulation of
      principles. If you must unite, Marx wrote to the party leaders,
      then enter into agreements to satisfy the practical aims of the
      movement, but do not allow any bargaining over principles, do
      not make theoretical “concessions”. This was Marxâs idea, and yet there are people among us who seekâin his nameâto belittle the significance of theory!
    

      Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary
      movement. This idea cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a
      time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes hand in
      hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical
      activity. Yet, for Russian Social-Democrats the importance of
      theory is enhanced by three other circumstances, which are often
      forgotten: first, by the fact that our Party is only in process
      of formation, its features are only just becoming defined, and
      it has as yet far from settled accounts with the other trends of
      revolutionary thought that threaten to divert the movement from
      the correct path. On the contrary, precisely the very recent
      past was marked by a revival of non-Social-Democratic
      revolutionary trends (an eventuation regarding which Axelrod
      long ago warned the Economists). Under these circumstances, what
      at first sight appears to be an “unimportant” error may lead to
      most deplorable consequences, and only short-sighted people can
      consider factional disputes and a strict differentiation between
      shades of opinion inopportune or superfluous. The fate of
      Russian Social-Democracy for very many years to come may depend
      on the strengthening of one or the other “shade”.
    

      Secondly, the Social-Democratic movement is in its very essence
      an international movement. This means, not only that we must
      combat national chauvinism, but that an incipient movement in a
      young country can be successful only if it makes use of the
      experiences of other countries. In order to make use of these
      experiences it is not enough merely to be acquainted with them,
      or simply to copy out the latest resolutions. What is required
      is the ability to treat these experiences critically and to test
      them independently. He who realises how enormously the modern
      working-class movement has grown and branched out will
      understand what a reserve of theoretical forces and political
      (as well as revolutionary) experience is required to carry out
      this task.
    

      Thirdly, the national tasks of Russian Social-Democracy are such
      as have never confronted any other socialist party in the
      world. We shall have occasion further on to deal with the
      political and organisational duties which the task of
      emancipating the whole people from the yoke of autocracy imposes
      upon us.  At this point, we wish to state only that the role
      of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is
      guided by the most advanced theory. To have a concrete
      understanding of what this means, let the reader recall such
      predecessors of Russian Social Democracy as Herzen, Belinsky,
      Chernyshevsky, and the brilliant galaxy of revolutionaries of
      the seventies; let him ponder over the world significance which
      Russian literature is now acquiring; let him. . . but be that
      enough!
    

      Let us quote what Engels said in 1874 concerning the
      significance of theory in the Social-Democratic movement. Engels
      recognizes, not two forms of the great struggle of
      Social Democracy (political and economic), as is the fashion
      among us, but three, placing the theoretical struggle on a
      par with the first two. His recommendations to the German
      working-class movement, which had become strong, practically and
      politically, are so instructive from the standpoint

 

  of present-day problems and controversies, that we hope the reader
      will not be vexed with us for quoting a long passage from his
      prefatory note to Der deutsche Bauernkrieg,[11]
  which has long become a great bibliographical rarity:
    

      “The German workers have two important advantages over those of
      the rest of Europe. First, they belong to the most theoretical
      people of Europe; and they have retained that sense of theory
      which the so-called ’educated’ classes of Germany have almost
      completely lost. Without German philosophy, which preceded it,
      particularly that of Hegel, German scientific socialism – the
      only scientific socialism that has ever existed – would never
      have come into being. Without a sense of theory among the
      workers, this scientific socialism would never have entered
      their flesh and blood as much as is the case. What an
      immeasurable advantage this is may be seen, on the one hand,
      from the indifference towards all theory, which is one of the
      main reasons why the English working-class movement crawls along
      so slowly in spite of the splendid organisation of the
      individual unions; on the other hand, from the mischief and
      confusion wrought by Proudhonism, in its original form, among
      the French and Belgians, and, in the form further caricatured by
      Bakunin, among the Spaniards and Italians.
    

      “The second advantage is that, chronologically speaking, the
      Germans were about the last to come into the workers’
      movement. Just as German theoretical socialism will never forget
      that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen
      – three men who, in spite of all their fantastic notions and
      all their utopianism, have their place among the most eminent
      thinkers of all times, and whose genius anticipated innumerable
      things, the correctness of which is now being scientifically
      proved by us – so the practical workers’ movement in Germany
      ought never to forget that it has developed on the shoulders of
      the English and French movements, that it was able simply to
      utilise their dearly bought experience, and could now avoid
      their mistakes, which in their time were mostly
      unavoidable. Without the precedent of the English trade unions
      and French workers’

 

  political struggles, without the gigantic
      impulse given especially by the Paris Commune, where would we be
      now?
    

      “It must be said to the credit of the German workers that they
      have exploited the advantages of their situation with rare
      understanding. For the first time since a workers’ movement has
      existed, the struggle is being conducted pursuant to its three
      sides – the. theoretical, the political, and the
      practical-economic (resistance to the capitalists) – in harmony
      and in its interconnections, and in a systematic way. It is
      precisely in this, as it were, concentric attack, that the
      strength and invincibility of the German movement lies.
    

      “Due to this advantageous situation, on the one hand, and to the
      insular peculiarities of the English and the forcible
      suppression  of the French movement, on the other, the German
      workers have for the moment been placed in the vanguard of the
      proletarian struggle. How long events will allow them to occupy
      this post of honour cannot be foretold. But let us hope that as
      long as they occupy it, they will fill it fittingly. This
      demands redoubled efforts in every field of struggle and
      agitation. In particular, it will be the duty of the leaders to
      gain an ever clearer insight into all theoretical questions, to
      free themselves more and more from the influence of traditional
      phrases inherited from the old world outlook, and constantly to
      keep in mind that socialism, since it has become a science,
      demands that it be pursued as a science, i.e., that it be
      studied. The task will be to spread with increased zeal among
      the masses of the workers the ever more clarified understanding
      thus acquired, to knit together ever more firmly the
      organisation both of the party and of the trade unions....
    

      “If the German workers progress in this way, they will not. be
      marching exactly at the head of the movement – it is not at all
      in the interest of this movement that the workers of any
      particular country should march at its head – but they will
      occupy an honourable place in the battle line; and they will
      stand armed for battle when either unexpectedly grave trials or
      momentous events demand of them increased courage, increased
      determination and energy.”[23]


      Engels’s words proved prophetic. Within a few years the German
      workers were subjected to unexpectedly grave trials in the form
      of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists.

 

  And they met those trials armed for battle and succeeded in emerging from
      them victorious.
    

      The Russian proletariat will have to undergo trials immeasurably
      graver; it will have to fight a monster compared with which an
      antisocialist law in a constitutional country seems but a
      dwarf. History has now confronted us with an immediate task
      which is the most revolutionary of all the
      immediate tasks confronting the proletariat of any
      country. The fulfilment of this task, the destruction of the
      most powerful bulwark, not only of European, but (it may now be
      said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian proletariat
      the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat. And
      we have the right to count upon acquiring this honourable title,
      already earned by our predecessors, the revolutionaries of the
      seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our movement, which is a
      thousand times broader and deeper, with the same devoted
      determination and vigour.

  A comparison of the two trends within the revolutionary
      proletariat (the revolutionary and the opportunist), and the two
      trends within the revolutionary bourgeoisie in the eighteenth
      century (the Jacobin, known as the Mountain, and the Girondist)
      was made in the leading article in No. 2 of Iskra
      (February 1901). The article was written by Plekhanov. The

      Cadets,[26] the
  Bezzaglavtsi,[27] and the Mensheviks to this day love to
      refer to Jacobinism in Russian Social-Democracy. But how
      Plekhanov came to apply this concept for the first time against
      the Right wing of Social-Democracy – about this they prefer to
      keep silent or to forget. (Author’s note to the 1907 edition –
      Ed.) —Lenin


[3]

  At the
      time Engels dealt his blows at Duhring, many representatives of
      German Social-Democracy inclined towards the latter’s

 

  views, and
      accusations of acerbity, intolerance, uncomradely polemics,
      etc., were hurled at Engels even publicly at a Party
      Congress. At the Congress of 1877,  Most, and his supporters,
      introduced a resolution to prohibit the publication of Engels’s
      articles in Vorwarts because “they do not interest the
      overwhelming majority of the readers”, and VahIteich declared
      that their publication had caused great damage to the Party,
      that Duhring too had rendered services to Social-Democracy: “We
      must utilise everyone in the interests of the Party; let the
      professors engage in polemics if they care to do so, but
      Vorwarts is not the place in which to conduct them”
      (Vorwarts, No. 65, June 6, 1877). Here we have another
      example of the defence of “freedom of criticism”, and our legal
      critics and illegal opportunists, who love so much to cite the
      example of the Germans, would do well to ponder it!

[4]
  It should be observed that Rabocheye Dyelo has always
      confined itself to a bare statement of facts concerning
      Bernsteinism in the German party and completely “refrained” from
      expressing its own opinion. See, for instance, the reports of
      the Stuttgart

  Congress[28] in No. 2-3 (p. 66), in which all the
      disagreements are reduced to “tactics” and the statement is
      merely made that the overwhelming majority remain true to the
      previous revolutionary tactics. Or, No. 4-5 (p. 25, et seq.), in
      which we have nothing but a paraphrasing of the speeches
      delivered at the Hanover Congress, with a reprint of Bebel’s
      resolution. An exposition and a criticism of Bernstein’s views
      are again put olf (as was the case in No. 2-8) to be dealt with
      in a “special article”. Curiously enough, in No. 4-5 (p. 33), we
      read the following: “...the views expounded by Bebel have the
      support of the vast majority of the Congress,” and a few lines
      thereafter:  “ ..David defended Bernstein’s views.... First of
      all, he tried to show that ... Bernstein and his friends, after
      all is said and done (sic!), stand on the basis of the class
      struggle...” This was written in December 1899, and in September
      1901 Rabocheye Dyelo, apparently no longer believing
      that Bebel was right, repeats David’s views as its own!

[24]
Lassalleans and Eisenachers—two parties in the German
 working-class movement in the sixties and early seventies of the nineteenth
 century.  

Lassalleans—supporters of Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864)
 and adherents of his theories; Lassalle was a German petty-bourgeois

 

 socialist who played an active part in organising (in 1863) the General
 Association of German Workers, a political organisation that existed up to
 1875. The programmatic demands of the Association were formulated by
 Lassalle in a number of articles and speeches. Lassalle regarded the state
 as a supra-class organisation and, in conformity with that philosophically
 idealist view, believed that the Prussian state could be utilised to solve
 the social problem through the setting up of producers’ co-operatives with
 its aid. Marx said that Lassalle advocated a “Royal-Prussian state
 socialism”. Lassalle directed the workers towards peaceful, parliamentary
 forms of struggle, believing that the introduction of universal suffrage
 would make Prussia a “free people’s state”. To obtain universal suffrage
 he promised Bismarck the support of his Association against the liberal
 opposition and also in the implementation of Bismarck’s plan to reunite
 Germany “from above” under the hegemony of Prussia. Lassalle repudiated
 the revolutionary class struggle, denied the importance of trade unions and
 of strike action, ignored the international tasks of the working class, and
 infected the German workers with nationalist ideas. His contemptuous
 attitude towards the peasantry, which he regarded as a reactionary force,
 did much damage to the German working-class movement. Marx and Engels
 fought his harmful utopian dogmatism and his reformist views. Their
 criticism helped free the German workers from the influence of Lassallean
 opportunism.  

Eisenachers—members of the Social-Democratic Workers’ Party
 of Germany, founded in 1869 at the Eisenach Congress. The leaders of the
 Eisenachers were August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, who were under the
 ideological influence of Marx and Engels. The Eisenach programme stated
 that the Social-Democratic Workers’ Party of Germany considered itself “a
 section of the International Working Men’s Association and shared its
 aspirations”. Thanks to the regular advice and criticism of Marx and
 Engels, the Eisenachers pursued a more consistent revolutionary policy than
 did Lassalle’s General Association of German Workers; in particular, on the
 question of German reunification, they followed “the democratic and
 proletarian road, struggling against the slightest concession to
 Prussianism, Bismarckism, and nationalism” (see present edition, Vol. 19,
 “August Bebel”). Under the influence of the growing working-class
 movement and of increased government repressions, the two parties united at
 the Gotha Congress in 1875 to form the Socialist Workers’ Party of Germany,
 of which the Lassalleans formed the opportunist wing.
   




[25]
Guesdists and Possibilists—two trends in the French
 socialist movement arising out of the split in the French Workers’ Party in
 1882.  

Guesdists—followers of Jules Guesde, constituted the Marxist
 wing of the movement and advocated an independent revolutionary policy of
 the proletariat. In 1901 they formed the Socialist Party of France.  


Possibilists—a petty-bourgeois, reformist trend that sought
 to divert the proletariat from revolutionary methods of struggle. The
 Possibilists advocated the restriction of working-class activity to what is
 “possible” under capitalism. In 1902, in conjunction with other reformist
 groups, the Possibilists organised the French Socialist Party.  

 In 1905 the Socialist Party of France and the French Socialist Party
 united to form a single party. During the imperialist war of 1944–18,
 Jules Guesde, together with the entire leadership of the French Socialist
 Party, went over to the camp of social-chauvinism.

[26]
Cadets—the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the principal
 bourgeois party in Russia, representing the liberal-monarchist
 bourgeoisie. It was formed in October 1905. Parading as democrats and
 calling themselves the party of “people’s freedom”, the Cadets tried to
 win the following of the peasantry. Their aim was to preserve tsarism in
 the form of a constitutional monarchy. After the victory of the October
 Socialist Revolution, the Cadets organised counter-revolutionary
 conspiracies and revolts against the Soviet Republic.
 




[27]
Bezzaglavtsi—from the title of the journal Bes
 Zaglaviya (Without a Title)—were organisers of, and
 contributors to, the journal published in St. Petersburg in 1906 by
 S. N. Prokopovich, Y. D. Kuskova, V. Y. Bogucharsky, and others. The
 journal openly advocated revisionism, supported the Mensheviks and
 liberals, and opposed an independent proletarian policy. Lenin called the
 group “pro-Menshevik Cadets or pro-Cadet Mensheviks”.
 




[13]
Ilovaisky, D. I. (1832–1920)—historian; author of numerous
 official textbooks of history that were extensively used in primary and
 secondary schools in pre-revolutionary Russia. In Ilovaisky’s texts history
 was reduced mainly to acts of kings and generals; the historical process
 was explained through secondary and fortuitous circumstances.
 




[14]
Katheder-Socialism—a trend in bourgeois political economy
 that emerged in Germany in the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth
 century. Under the guise of socialism the Katheder-Socialists preached
 bourgeois-liberal reformism from university chairs (Katheder).
 They maintained that the bourgeois state was above classes, that it was
 capable of reconciling hostile classes and gradually introducing
 “socialism”, without affecting the interests of the capitalists, while,
 at the same time, taking the demands of the workers as far as possible into
 consideration. In Russia the

 

 views of the Katheder-Socialists were disseminated by the “legal
 Marxists”.

Nozdryov—a character In Gogol’s Dead Souls whom the
 author called “an historical personage” for the reason that wherever he
 went he left behind him a scandalous “history”.
 




[16]
The Hanover resolution—resolution on “Attacks on the
 Fundamental Views and Tactics of the Party”, adopted by the German
 Social-Democratic Party Congress at Hanover, September 27–October 2
 (October 9–14), 1899. A discussion of this question at the Congress and
 the adoption of a special resolution were necessitated by the fact that the
 opportunists, led by Bernstein, launched a revisionist attack on Marxist
 theory and demanded a reconsideration of Social-Democratic revolutionary
 policy and tactics. The resolution adopted by the Congress rejected the
 demands of the revisionists, but failed to criticise and expose
 Bernsteinism. Bernstein’s supporters also voted for the resolution.
 




[28]
The Stuttgart Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party
 held on September 21–26 (October 3–8), 1898, was the first congress to
 discuss the question of revisionism in the German Social-Democratic
 Party. A statement from Bernstein (who did not attend) was read to the
 Congress; it amplified and defended the opportunist views he had previously
 set forth in a number of articles. There was, however, no unity among his
 opponents at the Congress. Some (Bebel, Kautsky, and others) called for an
 ideological struggle and a criticism of Bernstein’s errors, but opposed the
 adoption of organisational measures toward him. The others, led by Rosa
 Luxemburg—the minority—urged a more vigorous struggle against
 Bernsteinism.

 Maxim Gorky’s early stories.

 The reference is to the collection Material for a Characterisation

 copies in April 1895. The collection included Lenin’s article (signed
 K. Tulin) “The Economic Content of Narodism and the Criticism of
 It in Mr. Struve’s Book (The Reflection of Marxism in Bourgeois
 Literature)”, directed against the “legal Marxists” (see present
 edition, Vol. 1, pp. 333–507).
 




[29]
 “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” was written by Lenin
 in 1899, in exile. It was a reply to the Credo of a group of
 “Economists”

 

 (S. N. Prokopovich, Y. D. Kuskova, and others, who subsequently became
 Cadets). On receiving a copy of the Credo from his sister,
 A. I. Yelizarova, Lenin wrote a sharp protest in which be exposed the real
 nature of the declaration.  

 The Protest was discussed and unanimously endorsed by a meeting of 17
 exiled Marxists convened by Lenin in the village of Yermakovskoye,
 Minusinsk District (Siberia). Exiles in Turukhansk District (Siberia) and
 Orlovo (Vyatka Gubernia) subsequently associated themselves with the
 Protest.  

 Lenin forwarded a copy of the Protest abroad to the Emancipation of
 Labour group; Plekhanov published it in his Vademecum
 (Handbook—Ed.) for the Editors of Rabocheye
 Dyelo.

Byloye (The Past)—a monthly journal on historical
 problems published in St. Petersburg in 1906–07; in 1908 it changed its
 name to Minuvshiye Cody (Years Past). It was banned by
 the tsarist government in 1908, but resumed publication in Petrograd in
 July 1917 and continued in existence until 1926.

Profession de foi—a manifesto setting forth the opportunist
 views of the Kiev Committee, issued at the end of 1899. It was identical

 opportunism, since the Eisenachers made concessions to the Lassalleans on
 the most important points and accepted their formulations. Marx and Engels
 subjected the Gotha Programme to scathing criticism and characterised it as
 a retrograde step as compared with the Eisenach Programme of 1869 (See Karl

## The Spontaneity of the Masses and the Consciousness of the Social-Democrats




Lenin's What Is To Be Done?: The Spontaneity of the Masses and the Consciousness of the Social-Democrats








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
What Is To Be Done?
BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT



II
The Spontaneity of the Masses and the
      Consciousness of the Social-Democrats
      

      We have said that our movement, much more extensive and deep
      than the movement of the seventies, must be inspired with the
      same devoted determination and energy that inspired the movement
      at that time. Indeed, no one, we think, has until now doubted
      that the strength of the present-day movement lies in the
      awakening of the masses (principally, the industrial
      proletariat) and that its weakness lies in the lack of
      consciousness and initiative among the revolutionary leaders.
  

      However, of late a staggering discovery has been made, which
      threatens to disestablish all hitherto prevailing views on this
      question. This discovery was made by Rabocheye Dyelo,
      which in its polemic with Iskra and Zarya did
      not confine itself to making objections on separate points, but
      tried to ascribe “general disagreements” to a more profound
      cause — to the “different appraisals of the relative
  importance of the spontaneous and consciously ‘methodical’
      element”.


Rabocheye Dyelo formulated its indictment as
      a “belittling of the significance of the objective or the
      spontaneous element of development”.[1]
   To this we say: Had
      the polemics with Iskra and Zarya resulted in
      nothing more than causing Rabocheye Dyelo to hit upon
      these “general disagreements”, that alone would give us
      considerable satisfaction, so significant is this thesis and so
      clear is the light it sheds on the quintessence of the
      present-day theoretical and political differences that exist
      among Russian Social-Democrats.
  

      For this reason the question of the relation between
      consciousness and spontaneity is of such enormous general
      interest, and for this reason the question must be dealt with in
      great detail.
  

 A. The Beginning of the Spontaneous Upsurge
  

      In the previous chapter we pointed out how universally
  absorbed the educated youth of Russia was in the theories
      of Marxism in the middle of the nineties. In the same period the
      strikes that followed the famous St. Petersburg industrial war
      of 1896 assumed a similar general character. Their spread over
      the whole of Russia clearly showed the depth of the newly
      awakening popular movement, and if we are to speak of the
      “spontaneous element” then, of course, it is this strike
      movement which, first and foremost, must be regarded as
      spontaneous. But there is spontaneity and spontaneity. Strikes
      occurred in Russia in the seventies and sixties (and even in the
      first half of the nineteenth century), and they were accompanied
      by the “spontaneous” destruction of machinery, etc. Compared
      with these “revolts”, the strikes of the nineties might even be
      described as “conscious”, to such an extent do they mark the
      progress which the working-class movement made in that
      period. This shows that the “spontaneous element”, in essence,
      represents nothing more nor less than. consciousness in an
      embryonic form. Even the primitive revolts expressed
      the awakening of consciousness to a certain extent. The workers
      were losing their age-long faith in the permanence of the system
      which oppressed them and began... I shall not say to understand,
      but to sense

  

  the necessity for collective resistance, definitely
      abandoning their slavish submission to the authorities. But this
      was, nevertheless, more in the nature of outbursts of
      desperation and vengeance than of struggle. The strikes
      of the nineties revealed far greater flashes of consciousness;
      definite demands were advanced, the strike was carefully timed,
      known cases and instances in other places were discussed,
      etc. The revolts were simply the resistance of the oppressed,
      whereas the systematic strikes represented the class struggle in
      embryo, but only in embryo. Taken by themselves, these strikes
      were simply trade union struggles, not yet Social Democratic
      struggles. They marked the awakening antagonisms between workers
      and employers; but the workers, were not, and could not be,
      conscious of the irreconcilable antagonism of their interests to
      the whole of the modern political and social system, i.e.,
      theirs was not yet Social-Democratic consciousness. In this
      sense, the strikes of the nineties, despite the enormous
      progress they represented as compared with the “revolts”,
      remained a purely spontaneous movement.
  

      We have said that there could not have been
      Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. It would have
      to be brought to them from without. The history of all countries
      shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is
      able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the
      conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the
      employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary
      labour legislation, etc.[2] The theory of socialism, however,
      grew out of the philosophic, historical, and economic theories
      elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied
      classes, by intellectuals. By their social status the founders
      of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves
      belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. In the very same way,
      in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose
      altogether independently of the spontaneous growth of the
      working-class movement; it arose as a natural and inevitable
      outcome of the development of

 

  thought among the revolutionary
      socialist intelligentsia. In the period under discussion, the
      middle nineties, this doctrine not only represented the
      completely formulated programme of the Emancipation of Labour
      group, but had already won over to its side the majority of the
      revolutionary youth in Russia.
  

      Hence, we had both the spontaneous awakening of the working
      masses, their awakening to conscious life and conscious
      struggle, and a revolutionary youth, armed with
      Social-Democratic theory and straining towards the workers. In
      this connection it is particularly important to state the
      oft-forgotten (and comparatively little-known) fact that,
      although the early Social-Democrats of that period
      zealously carried on economic agitation (being guided
      in this activity by the truly useful indications contained in
      the pamphlet On Agitation,[27] then still in manuscript),
      they did not regard this as their sole task. On the contrary,
      from the very beginning they set for Russian
      Social-Democracy the most far-reaching historical tasks, in
      general, and the task of overthrowing the autocracy, in
      particular. Thus, towards the end of 1895, the St. Petersburg
      group of Social-Democrats, which founded the League of Struggle
      for the Emancipation of the Working Class, prepared the first
      issue of a newspaper called Rabocheye Dyelo. This issue
      was ready to go to press when it was seized by the gendarmes, on
      the night of December 8, 1895, in a raid on the house of one of
      the members of the group, Anatoly Alexeyevich Vaneyey,[3] so that
      the first edition of Rabocheye Dyelo was not destined
      to see the light of day. The leading article in this issue
      (which perhaps thirty years hence some Russkaya
  Starina[28] will unearth
  in the archives of the Department of Police)
      outlined the historical tasks of the working class in Russia and
      placed the achievement of political liberty at their head. The
      issue also contained an article entitled “What Are Our Ministers
      Thinking About?”[4] which dealt
  with the crushing of the

  

  elementary education committees by the police. In addition,
      there was some correspondence from St. Petersburg, and from
      other parts of Russia (e.g., a letter on the massacre of the
      workers in Yaroslavl Gubernia). This, “first effort”, if we are
      not mistaken, of the Russian Social-Democrats of the nineties
      was not a purely local, or less still, “Economic”, newspaper,
      but one that aimed to unite the strike movement with the
      revolutionary movement against the autocracy, and to win over to
      the side of Social-Democracy all who were oppressed by the
      policy of reactionary obscurantism. No one in the slightest
      degree acquainted with the state of the movement at that period
      could doubt that such a paper would have met with warm response
      among the workers of the capital and the revolutionary
      intelligentsia and would have had a wide circulation. The
      failure of the enterprise merely showed that the
      Social-Democrats of that period were unable to meet the
      immediate requirements of the time owing to their lack of
      revolutionary experience and practical training. This must be
      said, too, with regard to the S. Peterburgsky Rabochy
      Listok[29] and
  particularly with regard to Rabochaya Gazeta and
      the Manifesto of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party, founded in the spring of 1898. Of course, we would not
      dream of blaming the Social Democrats of that time for this
      unpreparedness. But in order to profit from the experience of
      that movement, and to draw practical lessons from it, we must
      thoroughly understand the causes and significance of this or
      that shortcoming. It is therefore highly important to establish
      the fact that a part (perhaps even a majority) of the
      Social-Democrats, active in the period of 1895-98, justly
      considered it possible even then, at the very beginning of the
      “spontaneous” movement, to come forward with a most extensive
      programme and a militant tactical line.[5] Lack of training of
      the majority of the revolutionaries,

  

  an entirely natural
      phenomenon, could not have roused any particular fears. Once the
      tasks were correctly defined, once the energy existed for
      repeated attempts to fulfil them, temporary failures represented
      only part misfortune. Revolutionary experience and
      organisational skill are things that can be acquired, provided
      the desire is there to acquire them, provided the shortcomings
      are recognised, which in revolutionary activity is more than
      half-way towards their removal.
  

      But what was only part misfortune became full misfortune when
      this consciousness began to grow dim (it was very much alive
      among the members of the groups mentioned), when there appeared
      people—and even Social -Democratic organs—that were
      prepared to regard shortcomings as virtues, that even tried to
      invent a theoretical basis for their slavish
      cringing before spontaneity. It is time to draw conclusions
      from this trend, the content of which is incorrectly and too
      narrowly characterised as Economism.
  

B. Bowing to Spontaneity. Rabochaya
        Mysl

      Before dealing with the literary manifestation of this
      subservience to spontaneity, we should like to note the
      following characteristic fact (communicated to us from the
      above-mentioned source), which throws light on the conditions in
      which the two future conflicting trends in Russian
      Social-Democracy arose and grew among the comrades working in
      St. Petersburg. In the beginning of 1897, just prior to their
      banishment, A. A. Vaneyev and several of his comrades attended a
      private meeting[30] at which “old” 
  and “young” members of the League
      of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class
      gathered. The conversation centred chiefly about the question of
      organisation, particularly about the “rules for the workers’
      mutual benefit fund”, which, in

   

  their final form, were published in “Listok”
  Rabotnika,[31] No. 9-10, p. 46. Sharp
      differences immediately showed themselves between the  “old”
      members (“Decembrists”, as the St. Petersburg Social Democrats
      jestingly called them) and several the “young” members (who
      subsequently took an active part in the work of Rabochaya
      Mysl), with a heated discussion ensuing. The “young”
      members defended the main principles of the rules in the form in
      which they were published. The “old” members contended that the
      prime necessity was not this, but the consolidation of the
      League of Struggle into an organisation of revolutionaries to
      which all the various workers’ mutual benefit funds, students’
      propaganda circles, etc., should be subordinated. It goes
      without saying that the disputing sides far from realised at the
      time that these disagreements were the beginning of a cleavage;
      on the contrary, they regarded them as something isolated and
      casual. But this fact shows that in Russia, too, Economism did
      not arise and spread without a struggle against the “old”
      Social-Democrats (which the Economists of today are apt to
      forget). And if, in the main, this struggle has not left
      “documentary” traces behind it, it is solely because
      the membership of the circles then functioning underwent such
      constant change that no continuity was established and,
      consequently, differences in point of view were not recorded in
      any documents.
  

      The founding of Rabochaya Mysl brought Economism to the
      light of day, but not at one stroke. We must picture to
      ourselves concretely the conditions for activity and the
      short-lived character of the majority of the Russian study
      circles (a thing that is possible only for those who have
      themselves experienced it) in order to understand how much there
      was of the fortuitous in the successes and failures of the new
      trend in various towns, and the length of time during which
      neither the advocates nor the opponents of the “new” could make
      up their minds — and literally had no opportunity of so doing
      — as to whether this really expressed a distinct trend or
      merely the lack of training of certain individuals. For example,
      the first mimeographed copies of Rabochaya Mysl never
      reached the great majority of Social-Democrats, and if we are
      able to refer to the leading article in the first number, it is
      only because it was reproduced in an article by

  

  V. I.[32] 
  (“Listok” Rabotnika, No. 9-10, p. 47, et seq.),
      who, of course, did not fail to extol with more zeal than reason
      the new paper, which was so different from the papers and
      projects for papers mentioned above.[6] It is well worth
      dwelling on this leading article because it brings out in bold
      relief the entire spirit of Rabochaya Mysl and
      Economism generally.
  

      After stating that the arm of the
  “blue-coats”[7] could never halt
      the progress of the working-class movement, the leading article
      goes on to say: “. . . The virility of the working-class
      movement is due to the fact that the workers themselves are at
      last taking their fate into their own hands, and out of the
      hands of the leaders”; this fundamental thesis is then developed
      in greater detail. Actually, the leaders (i.e., the
      Social-Democrats, the organisers of the League of Struggle)
      were, one might say, torn out of the hands of the workers[8] by the
      police; yet it is made to appear that the workers were fighting
      against the leaders and liberated themselves from their yoke!
      Instead of sounding the call to go forward towards the
      consolidation of the revolutionary organisation and the
      expansion of political activity, the call was issued for a
      retreat to the purely trade union struggle. It was
      announced that “the economic basis of the movement is eclipsed
      by the effort never to forget the political ideal”, and that the
      watchword for the working-class movement was “Struggle for
      economic conditions” (!) or, better still, “The workers for the
      workers”. It was declared that strike funds “are more valuable
      to the movement than a hundred other Organisations” (compare
      this statement made in October 1897, with the

   

  polemic between
      the “Decembrists” and the young members in the beginning of
      1897), etc. Catchwords like “We must concentrate, not on the
      ’cream’ of the workers, but on the ’average’, mass worker”;
      “Politics always obediently follows economics”,[9] etc., etc., became
      the fashion, exercising an irresistible influence upon the
      masses of the youth who were attracted to the movement but who,
      in the majority of cases, were acquainted only with such
      fragments of Marxism as were expounded in legally appearing
      publications.
  

      Political consciousness was completely overwhelmed by
      spontaneity — the spontaneity of the “Social-Democrats” who
      repeated Mr. V. V.’s “ideas”, the spontaneity of those workers
      who were carried away by the arguments that a kopek added to a
      ruble was worth more than any socialism or politics, and that
      they must “fight, knowing that they are fighting, not for the
      sake of some future generation, but for themselves and their
      children” (leader in Rabochaya Mysl, No. 1). Phrases
      like these have always been a favourite weapon of the
      West-European bourgeois, who, in their hatred for socialism,
      strove (like the German “Sozial-Politiker” Hirsch) to
      transplant English trade-unionism to their native soil and to
      preach to the workers that by engaging in the purely trade union
      struggle[10] they would be
  fighting for themselves and for their
      children, and not for some future generations with some future
      socialism. And now the “V. V.s of Russian Social-Democracy” have
      set about repeating these bourgeois phrases. It is important at
      this point to note three circumstances that will be useful to
      our further analysis of contemporary
  differences.[11]
[11]



      We emphasise the word contemporary for the benefit of
      those who may pharisaically shrug their shoulders and say: It is
      easy enough to attack Rabochaya Mysl now, but is not
      all this ancient history? Mutato nomine de te fabula
      narratur (change the name and the tale is

  

  about you—Ed.)
      is our answer to such contemporary Pharisees, whose complete
      subjection to the ideas of Rabochaya Mysl will be proved
      further on. —Lenin





      In the first place, the overwhelming of political consciousness
      by spontaneity, to which we referred above, also took place
      spontaneously. This may sound like a pun, but, alas, it
      is the bitter truth. It did not take place as a result of an
      open struggle between two diametrically opposed points of view,
      in which one triumphed over the other; it occurred because of
      the fact that an increasing number of “old” revolutionaries were
      “torn away” by the gendarmes and increasing numbers of “young”
      “V. V.s of Russian Social Democracy” appeared on the
      scene. Everyone, who has, I shall not say participated in, but
      at least breathed the atmosphere of, the present-day
      Russian movement, knows perfectly well that this is precisely
      the case. And if, nevertheless, we insist strongly that the
      reader be fully clear on this generally known fact, if we cite,
      for explicitness, as it were, the facts of the first edition of
      Rabocheye Dyelo and of the polemic between the “old”
      and the “young” at the beginning of 1897, we do this because the
      people who vaunt their “democracy” speculate on the ignorance of
      these facts on the part of the broad public (or of the very
      young generation). We shall return to this point further on.
  

      Secondly, in the very first literary expression of Economism we
      observe the exceedingly curious phenomenon — highly
      characteristic for an understanding of all the differences
      prevailing among presentday Social Democrats — that the
      adherents of the “labour movement pure and simple”, worshippers
      of the closest “organic” contacts (Rabocheye Dyelo’s
      term) with the proletarian struggle, opponents of any non-worker
      intelligentsia (even a socialist intelligentsia), are compelled,
      in order to defend their positions, to resort to the arguments
      of the bourgeois “pure trade-unionists”. This shows
      that from the very outset Rabochaya Mysl began —
      unconsciously — to implement the programme of the
      Credo. This shows (something Rabocheye Dyelo
      cannot grasp) that all worship of the spontaneity of
      the working class movement, all belittling of the role of “the
      conscious element”, of the role of Social-Democracy, means,
      quite independently of whether he who belittles that role
      desires it or not, a strengthening

   

  of the influence of bourgeois
      ideology upon the workers. All those who talk about
      “overrating the importance of ideology”,[12] about exaggerating
      the role of the conscious element,[13] etc., imagine that
      the labour movement pure and simple can elaborate, and will
      elaborate, an independent ideology for itself, if only the
      workers “wrest their fate from the hands of the leaders”. But
      this is a profound mistake. To supplement what has been said
      above, we shall quote the following profoundly true and
      important words of Karl. Kautsky on the new draft programme of
      the Austrian Social-Democratic Party:[14]



      “Many of our revisionist critics believe that Marx asserted that
      economic development and the class struggle create, not only the
      conditions for socialist production, but also, and directly, the
      consciousness [K. K.’s italics] of its necessity. And
      these critics assert that England, the country most highly
      developed capitalistically, is more remote than any other from
      this consciousness Judging by the draft, one might assume that
      this allegedly orthodox Marxist view, which is thus refuted, was
      shared by the committee that drafted the Austrian programme. In
      the draft programme it is stated: ‘The more capitalist
      development increases the numbers of the proletariat, the more
      the proletariat is compelled and becomes fit to fight against
      capitalism. The proletariat becomes conscious of the possibility
      and of the necessity for socialism.’ In this connection socialist
      consciousness appears to be a necessary and direct result of the
      proletarian class struggle. But this is absolutely untrue. Of
      course, socialism, as a doctrine, has its roots in modern
      economic relationships just as the class struggle of the
      proletariat has, and, like the latter, emerges from the struggle
      against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the
      masses. But socialism and the class struggle arise side by side
      and not one out of the other; each arises under different
      conditions. Modern socialist consciousness can arise only on the
      basis of profound scientific knowledge. Indeed, modern economic
      science is as much a condition for socialist production as, say,
      modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither the
      one nor the other, no matter how much it may desire to do so;
      both arise out of the modern social process. The vehicle of
      science is not the proletariat, but the bourgeois
      intelligentsia [K. K.’s italics]: it was in the minds of
      individual members of this stratum that modern socialism
      originated, and it was they who communicated it to the more
      intellectually developed proletarians who, in their turn,
      introduce it into the proletarian class struggle where

   

      conditions allow that to be done. Thus, socialist consciousness
      is something introduced into the proletarian class struggle from
      without [von Aussen Hineingetragenes] and not something
      that arose within it spontaneously
      [urwüchsig]. Accordingly, the old Hainfeld
      programme quite rightly stated that the task of Social-Democracy
      is to imbue the proletariat (literally: saturate the
      proletariat) with the consciousness of its position and
      the consciousness of its task. There would be no need for this
      if consciousness arose of itself from the class struggle. The
      new draft copied this proposition from the old programme, and
      attached it to the proposition mentioned above. But this
      completely broke the line of thought...”
  


      Since there can be no talk of an independent ideology formulated
      by the working masses themselves in the process of their
      movement,[15]
[15] This
      does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part in
      creating such an ideology. They take part, however, not as
      workers, but as socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons and
      Weitlings; in other words, they take part only when they are
      able, and to the extent that they are able, more or less, to
      acquire the knowledge of their age and develop that
      knowledge. But in order that working men may succeed in this
      more often, every effort must be made to raise the level of
      the consciousness of the workers in general; it is necessary
      that the workers do not confine themselves to the artificially
      restricted limits of  “literature for workers” but that
      they learn to an increasing degree to master general
      literature. It would be even truer to say “are not
      confined”, instead of “do not confine themselves”, because the
      workers themselves wish to read and do read all that is written
      for the intelligentsia, and only a few (bad) intellectuals
      believe that it is enough “for workers” to be told a few things
      about factory conditions and to have repeated to them over and
      over again what has long been known. —Lenin


    the only choice is — either
      bourgeois or socialist ideology. There is no middle course (for
      mankind has not created a “third” ideology, and, moreover, in a
      society torn by class antagonisms there can never be a non-class
      or an above-class ideology). Hence, to belittle the socialist
      ideology in any way, to turn aside from it in the slightest
      degree means to strengthen bourgeois ideology. There is
      much talk of spontaneity. But the spontaneous
      development of the working-class movement leads to its
      subordination to bourgeois ideology, to its development
      along the lines of the Credo programme; for the spontaneous
      working-class movement is trade-unionism, is
      Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, and trade unionism means the
      ideological enslavement of the workers by the
      bourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is
      to combat spontaneity, to divert the working-class
      movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist striving to come

  

      under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the
      wing of revolutionary Social Democracy. The sentence employed by
      the authors of the Economist letter published in Iskra,
      No. 12, that the efforts of the most inspired ideologists fail
      to divert the working-class movement from the path that is
      determined by the interaction of the material elements and the
      material environment is therefore tantamount to renouncing
      socialism. If these authors were capable of fearlessly,
      consistently, and thoroughly considering what they say, as
      everyone who enters the arena of literary and public activity
      should be, there would be nothing left for them but to “fold
      their useless arms over their empty breasts” and surrender the
      field of action to the Struves and Prokopoviches, who are
      dragging the working-class movement “along the line of least
      resistance”, i.e., along the line of bourgeois trade-unionism,
      or to the Zubatovs, who are dragging it along the line of
      clerical and gendarme “ideology”.
  

      Let us recall the example of Germany. What was the historic
      service Lassalle rendered to the German working-class movement?
      It was that he diverted that movement from the path of
      progressionist trade-unionism and co-operativism towards which
      it had been spontaneously moving (with the benign assistance
      of Schulze-Delitzsch and his like). To fulfil such a task
      it was necessary to do something quite different from talking of
      underrating the spontaneous element, of tactics-as-process, of
      the interaction between elements and environment, etc. A
      fierce struggle against spontaneity was necessary, and only
      after such a struggle, extending over many years, was it
      possible, for instance, to convert the working population of
      Berlin from a bulwark of the progressionist party into one of
      the finest strongholds of Social-Democracy. This struggle is by
      no means over even today (as might seem to those who learn the
      history of the German movement from Prokopovich, and its
      philosophy from Struve). Even now the German working class is,
      so to speak, split up among a number of ideologies. A section of
      the workers is organised in Catholic and monarchist trade
      unions; another section is organised in the
  Hirsch-Duncker[33]
      unions, founded by the bourgeois worshippers of English
      trade-unionism; the third is organised in Social-Democratic
      trade unions. The last-named group is immeasurably more numerous
      than the rest,

  

  but the Social-Democratic ideology was able to
      achieve this superiority, and will be able to maintain it, only
      in an unswerving struggle against all other ideologies.
  

      But why, the reader will ask, does the spontaneous movement, the
      movement along the line of least resistance, lead to the
      domination of bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason that
      bourgeois ideology is far older in origin than socialist
      ideology, that it is more fully developed, and that it has at
      its disposal immeasurably more means of
      dissemination.[16]
[16] 
      It is often said that the working class spontaneously
  gravitates towards socialism. This is perfectly true in the
      sense that socialist theory reveals the causes of the misery of
      the working class more profoundly and more correctly than any
      other theory, and for that reason the workers are able to
      assimilate it so easily, provided, however, this theory
      does not itself yield to spontaneity, provided it
      subordinates spontaneity to itself. Usually this is taken for
      granted, but it is precisely this which Rabocheye Dyelo
      forgets or distorts. The working class spontaneously gravitates
      towards socialism; nevertheless, most widespread (and
      continuously and diversely revived) bourgeois ideology
      spontaneously imposes itself upon the working class to a still
      greater degree. —Lenin


   And the younger the socialist
      movement in any given country, the more vigorously it must
      struggle against all attempts to entrench non-socialist
      ideology, and the more resolutely the workers must be warned
      against the bad counsellors who shout against “overrating the
      conscious element”, etc. The authors of the Economist letter, in
      unison with Rabocheye Dyelo, inveigh against the
      intolerance that is characteristic of the infancy of the
      movement. To this we reply: Yes, our movement is indeed in its
      infancy, and in order that it may grow up faster, it must become
      imbued with intolerance against those who retard its growth by
      their subservience to spontaneity. Nothing is so ridiculous and
      harmful as pretending that we are “old hands” who have long 
  ago experienced all the decisive stages of the struggle.
  

      Thirdly, the first issue of Rabochaya Mysl shows that the term
      “Economism” (which, of course, we do not propose to abandon,
      since, in one way or another, this designation has already
      established itself) does not adequately convey the real
      character of the new trend. Rabochaya Mysl does not
      altogether repudiate the political struggle; the rules for a
      workers’ mutual benefit fund published in its first issue
      contain

   

  a reference to combating the government. Rabochaya
      Mysl believes, however, that “politics always obediently
      follows economics” (Rabocheye Dyelo varies this thesis
      when it asserts in its programme that “in Russia more than in
      any other country, the economic struggle is inseparable
      from the political struggle”). If by politics is meant
      Social-Democratic politics, then the theses of Rabochaya
      Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelo are utterly incorrect. The
      economic struggle of the workers is very often connected
      (although not inseparably) with bourgeois politics, clerical
      politics, etc., as we have seen. Rabocheye Dyelo’s
      theses are correct, if by politics is meant trade union
      politics, viz., the common striving of all workers to secure
      from the government measures for alleviating the distress to
      which their condition gives rise, but which do not abolish that
      condition, i.e., which do not remove the subjection of labour to
      capital. That striving indeed is common to the English
      trade-unionists, who are hostile to socialism, to the Catholic
      workers, to the “Zubatov” workers, etc. There is politics and
      politics. Thus, we see that Rabochaya Mysl does not so
      much deny the political struggle, as it bows to its
      spontaneity, to its unconsciousness. While fully
      recognising the political struggle (better: the political
      desires and demands of the workers), which arises spontaneously
      from the working-class movement itself, it absolutely refuses
      independently to work out a specifically
      Social-Democratic politics corresponding to the general
      tasks of socialism and to present-day conditions in
      Russia. Further on we shall show that Rabocheye Dyelo
      commits the same error.
  

C. The Self-Emancipation
  Group[34] and
    Rabocheye Dyelo

      We have dealt at such length with the little-known and now
      almost forgotten leading article in the first issue of Rabochaya
      Mysl because it was the first and most striking expression of
      that general stream of thought which afterwards emerged into the
      light of day in innumerable streamlets. V. I. was perfectly
      right when, in praising the first issue and the leading article
      of Rabochaya Mysl, he said that the article had been
      written in a “sharp and fervent” manner (“Listok”
      Rabotnika, No. 9-10, p. 49). Every man with convictions who

   

      thinks he has something new to say writes “fervently” and in
      such a way as to make his views stand out in bold relief. Only
      those who are accustomed to sitting between two stools lack
      “fervour”; only such people are able to praise the fervour of
      Rabochaya Mysl one day and attack the “fervent
      polemics” of its opponents the next.
  

      We shall not dwell on the  “Separate Supplement” to
      Rabochaya Mysl (below we shall have occasion, on various
      points, to refer to this work, which expresses the ideas of the
      Economists more consistently than any other) but shall briefly
      mention the “Appeal of the Self-Emancipation of the Workers
      Group” (March 1899, reprinted in the London
  Nakanune,[35]
      No. 7, July 1899). The authors of the “Appeal” rightly say that
      “the workers of Russia are only just awakening, are
      just beginning to look about them, and are instinctively
      clutching at the first available means of struggle”. Yet
      they draw from this the same false conclusion as that drawn by
      Rabochaya Mysl, forgetting that the instinctive is the
      unconscious (the spontaneous) to the aid of which socialists
      must come; that the “first available means of struggle” will
      always be, in modern society, the trade union means of struggle,
      and the “first available” ideology the bourgeois (trade union)
      ideology. Similarly, these authors do not  “repudiate” politics,
      they merely (merely!) echo Mr. V. V. that politics is the
      superstructure, and therefore, “political agitation must be the
      superstructure to the agitation carried on in favour of the
      economic struggle; it must arise on the basis of this struggle
      and follow in its wake”.
  

      As for Rabocheye Dyelo, it began its activity with the
      “defence” of the Economists. It stated a downright
      untruth in its opening issue (No. 1, pp. 141-42) in
      claiming that it “does not know to which young comrades Axelrod
      referred” when he warned the Economists in his well-known
      pamphlet.[17] In the 
  polemic that flared up with Axelrod and Plekhanov over this untruth, 
  Rabocheye Dyelo had to admit that “in form of perplexity, 
  it sought to defend all the younger Social-Democrats abroad from
      this unjust accusation” (the charge of narrowness levelled by
      Axelrod at the Economists). In reality this accusation was

   

      completely justified, and Rabocheye Dyelo knew
      perfectly well that, among others, it applied also to V. I., a
      member of its Editorial Board. Let me note in passing that in
      this polemic Axelrod was entirely right and Rabocheye
      Dyelo entirely wrong in their respective interpretations of
      my pamphlet The Tasks of the Russian
      Social-Democrats.[18] The pamphlet
      was written in 1897, before the appearance of Rabochaya Mysl,
      when I thought, rightly, that the original tendency of
      the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, which I characterised
      above, was dominant. And this tendency was dominant at least
      until the middle of 1898. Consequently, Rabocheye Dyelo
      had no right whatever, in its attempt to deny the existence and
      danger of Economism, to refer to a pamphlet that expressed views
      forced out by Economist views in St. Petersburg in
      1897-98.[19]


      But Rabocheye Dyelo not only “defended” the Economists,
      it itself constantly fell into their fundamental errors. The
      source of this confusion is to be found in the ambiguity of the
      interpretation given to the following thesis of the
      Rabocheye Dyelo programme: “We consider that the most
      important phenomenon of Russian life, the one that will mainly
      determine the tasks [our italics] and the character of
      the publication activity of the Union, is the mass
      working-class movement [Rabocheye Dyelo’s italics]
      which has arisen in recent years.” That the mass movement is a
      most important phenomenon is a fact not to be disputed. But the
      crux of the matter is, how is one to understand the statement
      that the mass working class movement will “determine the tasks”?
      
   

      It may be interpreted in one of two ways. Either it means bowing to the
      spontaneity of this movement, i.e., reducing the role of Social-Democracy
      to mere subservience to the working-class movement as such (the
      interpretation of Rabochaya Mysl, the Self-Emancipation Group,
      and other Economists), or it means that the mass movement places before us
      new theoretical, political, and organisational tasks, far more complicated
      than those that might have satisfied us in the period before the rise of
      the mass movement. Rabocheye Dyelo inclined and still inclines
      towards the first interpretation, for it has said nothing definite about
      any new tasks, but has argued constantly as though the “mass movement”
      relieves us of the necessity of clearly understanding and
      fulfilling the tasks it sets before us. We need only point out that
      Rabocheye Dyelo considered that it was impossible to set the
      overthrow of the autocracy as the first task of the mass
      working-class movement, and that it degraded this task (in the name of the
      mass movement) to that of a struggle for immediate political demands
      (Reply, p. 25).
      

      We shall pass over the article by B. Krichevsky, editor of
      Rabocheye Dyelo, entitled “The Economic and the
      Political Struggle in the Russian Movement”, published in No. 7
      of that paper, in which these very mistakes[20] are repeated, and

  

      proceed directly to Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10. We shall
      not, of course, enter in detail into the various objections
      raised by Krichevsky and Martynov against Zarya and
      Iskra. We are here interested solely in the basis of
      principles on which Rabocheye Dyelo, in its tenth
      issue, took its stand. Thus, we shall not examine the strange
      fact that Rabocheye Dyelo saw a “diametrical
      contradiction” between the proposition:
  



      “Social-Democracy does not, tie its hands, it does not restrict
      its activities to some one preconceived plan or method of
      political struggle; it recognises all means of struggle  as long
      as they correspond to the forces at-the disposal of the Party,”
      etc. (Iskra, No. 1)[21].
  



  and the proposition:
  



      “Without a strong organisation skilled in waging political
      struggle under all circumstances and at all times, there can be
      no question of that systematic plan of action, illumined by firm
      principles and steadfastly carried out, which alone is worthy of
      the name of tactics” (Iskra, No. 4).[22]




      To confound recognition, in principle, of all means of
      struggle, of all plans and methods, provided they are expedient,
      with the demand at a given political moment to be
      guided by a strictly observed plan is tantamount, if we are to
      talk of tactics, to confounding the recognition by medical
      science of various methods of treating diseases with the
      necessity for adopting a certain definite method of treatment
      for a given disease. The point is, however, that Rabocheye
      Dyelo, itself the victim of a disease which we have called
      bowing to spontaneity, refuses to recognise any “method of
      treatment” for that disease. Hence, it has made the remarkable
      discovery that “tactics-as-plan contradicts the fundamental
      spirit of Marxism” (No. 10, p. 18), that tactics are “a
      process of growth of Party tasks, which grow together with the
      Party” (p. 11, Rabocheye Dyelo’s italics). This
      remark

   

  has every chance of becoming a celebrated maxim, a
      permanent monument to the Rabocheye Dyelo “trend”. To
      the question, whither? the leading organ replies: Movement is a
      process of changing the distance between the starting-point and
      subsequent points of the movement. This matchless example of
      profundity is not merely a curiosity (were it that, it would not
      be worth dealing with at length), but the programme of a
      whole trend, the very programme which R. M. (in the
      “Separate Supplement” to Rabochaya Mysl)
      expressed in the words: That struggle is desirable which is
      possible, and the struggle which is possible is that which is
      going on at the given moment. This is precisely the trend of
      unbounded opportunism, which passively adapts itself to
      spontaneity.
  

      “Tactics-as-plan contradicts the essence of Marxism!” But this
      is a slander of Marxism; it means turning Marxism into the
      caricature held up by the Narodniks in their struggle against
      us. It means belittling the initiative and energy of
      class-conscious fighters, whereas Marxism, on the contrary,
      gives a gigantic impetus to the initiative and energy of the
      Social-Democrat, opens up for him the widest perspectives, and
      (if one may so express it) places at his disposal the mighty
      force of many millions of workers “spontaneously” rising for the
      struggle. The entire history of international Social-Democracy
      teems with plans advanced now by one, now by another political
      leader, some confirming the far-sightedness and the correct
      political and organisational views of their authors and others
      revealing their short-sightedness and their political errors. At
      the time when Germany was at one of the crucial turning-points
      in its history — the formation of the Empire, the opening of
      the Reichstag, and the granting of universal suffrage —
      Liebknecht had one plan for Social-Democratic politics and work
      in general, and Schweitzer had another. When the anti-socialist
      law came down on the heads of the German socialists, Most and
      Hasselmann had one plan — they were prepared then and there to
      call for violence and terror; Hochbert, Schramm, and (partly)
      Bernstein had another — they began to preach to the
      Social-Democrats that they themselves had provoked the enactment
      of the law by being unreasonably bitter and revolutionary, and
      must now earn forgiveness by their exemplary conduct. There was

   

      yet a third plan, proposed by those who prepared and carried out
      the publication of an illegal organ. It is easy, of course, with
      hindsight, many years after the struggle over the selection of
      the path to be followed, and after history has pronounced its
      verdict as to the expediency of the path selected, to utter
      profound maxims about the growth of Party tasks, which grow
      together with the Party. But at a time of confusion,[23] when
      the Russian “Critics” and Economists are degrading
      Social-Democracy to the level of trade-unionism, and when the
      terrorists are strongly advocating the adoption of
      “tactics-as-plan” that repeats the old mistakes, at such a time,
      to confine oneself to profundities of this kind, means simply to
      issue to oneself a “certificate of poverty”. At a time when many
      Russian Social-Democrats suffer from a lack of initiative and
      energy, from an inadequate “scope of political propaganda,
      agitation, and organisation,”[24] from
  a lack of “plans” for a
      broader organisation of revolutionary work, at such a time, to
      declare that “tactics-as-plan” contradicts the essence of
      Marxism means not only to vulgarise Marxism in the realm of
      theory, but to drag the Party backward in practice.
  

Rabocheye Dyelo goes on to sermonise:
  


      “The task of the revolutionary Social-Democrat is only to
      accelerate objective development by his conscious work, not to
      obviate it or substitute his own subjective plans for this
      development. Iskra knows all this in theory; but the
      enormous importance which Marxism justly attaches to conscious
      revolutionary work causes it in practice, owing to its
      doctrinaire view of tactics, to belittle the significance of
      the objective or the spontaneous element of development”
      (p. 18).
  


      Another example of the extraordinary theoretical confusion
      worthy of Mr. V. V. and his fraternity. We would ask our
      philosopher: how may a designer of subjective plans “belittle”
      objective development? Obviously by losing sight of the fact
      that this objective development creates or strengthens, destroys

   

      or weakens certain classes, strata, or groups, certain nations
      or groups of nations, etc., and in this way serves to determine
      a given international political alignment of forces, or the
      position adopted by revolutionary parties, etc. If the designer
      of plans did that, his guilt would not be that he belittled the
      spontaneous element, but, on the contrary, that he belittled the
      conscious element, for he would then show that he
      lacked the “consciousness” properly to understand objective
      development. Hence, the very talk of “estimating the
      relative significance” (Rabocheye Dyelo’s
      italics) of spontaneity and consciousness itself reveals a
      complete lack of “consciousness”. If certain “spontaneous
      elements of development” can be grasped at all by human
      understanding, then an incorrect estimation of them will be
      tantamount to “belittling the conscious element”. But if they
      cannot be grasped, then we do not know them, and therefore
      cannot speak of them. What then is Krichevsky discussing? If he
      thinks that Iskra’s  “subjective plans” are 
  erroneous (as he in fact declares them to be), he should have shown what
      objective facts they ignore, and only then charged
      Iskra with lacking political consciousness for
      ignoring them, with “belittling the conscious element”, to use
      his own words. If, however, displeased with subjective plans, he
      can bring forward no argument other than that of “belittling the
      spontaneous element” (!), he merely shows: (1) that,
      theoretically, he understands Marxism a la Kareyev and
      Mikhailovsky, who have been sufficiently ridiculed by
  Beltov;[36] and 
  (2) that, practically, he is quite satisfied with the
      “spontaneous elements of development” that have drawn our legal
      Marxists towards Bernsteinism and our Social-Democrats towards
      Economism, and that he is “full of wrath” against those who have
      determined at all costs to divert Russian
      Social-Democracy from the path of “spontaneous” development.
  

      Further, there follow things that are positively droll. “Just as
      human beings will reproduce in the old-fashioned way despite all
      the discoveries of natural science, so the birth of a new social
      order will come about, in the future too, mainly as a
      result of elemental outbursts, despite all the discoveries of
      social science and the increase in the number of conscious
      fighters” (p. 19). Just as our grandfathers in

 

  their old-fashioned wisdom used to say, Anyone can 
  bring children into the world, so today the
      “modern socialists” (a la Nartsis
  Tuporylov)[37] say in
      their wisdom, Anyone can participate in the spontaneous birth of
      a new social order. We too hold that anyone can. All that is
      required for participation of that kind is to yield to
      Economism when Economism reigns and to terrorism when terrorism
      arises. Thus, in the spring of this year, when it was so
      important to utter a note of warning against infatuation with
      terrorism, Rabocheye Dyelo stood in amazement,
      confronted by a problem that was “new” to it. And now, six
      months after, when the problem has become less topical, it
      presents us at one and the same time with the declaration: “We
      think that it is not and should not be the task of
      Social-Democracy to counteract the rise of terroristic
      sentiments” (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, p. 23), and with
      the Conference resolution: “The Conference regards systematic
      and aggressive terror as being inopportune” (Two
      Conferences, p. 18). How beautifully clear and coherent
      this is! Not to counteract, but to declare inopportune, and to
      declare it in such a way that unsystematic and defensive terror
      does not come within the scope of the “resolution”. It must be
      admitted that such a resolution is extremely safe and is fully
      insured against error, just as a man who talks, but says
      nothing, insures himself against error. All that is needed to
      frame such a resolution is  an ability to keep at the tail
      end of the movement. When Iskra ridiculed
      Rabocheye Dyelo for declaring the question of terror to
      be new,[25] the 
  latter angrily accused
      Iskra of “having the incredible effrontery to impose
      upon the Party organisation solutions of tactical questions
      proposed by a group of emigrant writers more than fifteen years
      ago” (p. 24). Effrontery. indeed, and what an overestimation of
      the conscious element — first to resolve questions
      theoretically beforehand, and then to try to convince the
      organisation, the Party, and the masses of the correctness of
      this solution![26] How much better
  it would be to repeat the elements and, without “imposing” 
  anything upon anybody, swing with every

  

 “turn” — whether in the direction of
      Economism or in the direction of terrorism. Rabocheye
      Dyelo even generalises this great precept of worldly wisdom
      and accuses Iskra and Zarya of  “setting up
      their programme against the movement, like a spirit hovering
      over the formless chaos” (p. 29). But what else is the function
      of Social-Democracy if not to be a “spirit” that not only hovers
      over the spontaneous movement, but also raises this
      movement to the level of “its programme”? Surely, it is
      not its function to drag at the tail of the
      movement. At best, this would be of no service to the movement;
      at worst, it would be exceedingly harmful. Rabocheye
      Dyelo, however, not only follows this “tactics-as-process”,
      but elevates it to a principle, so that it would be more correct
      to describe its tendency not as opportunism, but as
      tail-ism (from the word tail). And it must be
      admitted that those who are determined always to follow behind
      the movement and be its tail are absolutely and forever
      guaranteed against “belittling the spontaneous element of
      development”.
  
 *     *  * 

      And so, we have become convinced that the fundamental error
      committed by the “new trend” in Russian Social-Democracy is its
      bowing to spontaneity and its failure to understand that the
      spontaneity of the masses demands a high degree of consciousness
      from us Social-Democrats. The greater the spontaneous upsurge of
      the masses and the more widespread the movement, the more rapid,
      incomparably so, the demand for greater consciousness in the
      theoretical, political and organisational work of
      Social-Democracy.
  

      The spontaneous upsurge of the masses in Russia proceeded (and
      continues) with such rapidity that the young Social Democrats
      proved unprepared to meet these gigantic tasks. This
      unpreparedness is our common misfortune, the misfortune of
      all Russian Social-Democrats. The upsurge of the masses
      proceeded and spread with uninterrupted continuity; it not only
      continued in the places where it began, but spread to new
      localities and to new strata of the population (under the
      influence of the working class movement, there was a renewed
      ferment among the student youth, among the intellectuals
      generally, and even among the peasantry). Revolutionaries,

   

      however, lagged behind this upsurge, both in their
      “theories” and in their activity; they failed to establish a
      constant and continuous organisation capable of leading
  the whole movement.
  

      In Chapter I, we established that Rabocheye Dyelo
      belittled our theoretical tasks and that it “spontaneously”
      repeated the fashionable catchword “freedom of criticism”; those
      who repeated this catchword lacked the “consciousness” to
      understand that the positions of the opportunist “Critics” and
      those of the revolutionaries in Germany and in Russia are
      diametrically opposed.
  

      In the following chapters, we shall show how this bowing to
      spontaneity found expression in the sphere of the political
      tasks and in the organisational work of Social-Democracy.

    Trade-unionism does not exclude “politics” altogether, as some
    imagine. Trade unions have always conducted some political (but
    not Social-Democratic) agitation and struggle. We shall deal
    with the difference between trade union politics and
    Social-Democratic politics in the next chapter.—Lenin

[3]
    A. A. Vaneyev died in Eastern Siberia in 1899 from consumption,
    which he contracted during solitary confinement in prison prior
    to his banishment. That is why we considered it possible to
    publish the above information, the authenticity of which we
    guarantee, for it comes from persons who were closely and
    directly acquainted with A. A. Vaneyev.—Lenin

[4]
See present edition, Vol. 2, pp. 87-92.—Ed.
    

[5] “In
    adopting a hostile attitude towards the activities of the
    Social-Democrats of the late nineties, Iskra ignores
    the absence at that time of conditions for any work other than
    the struggle for petty demands,” declare the Economists in their
    “Letter to Russian Social-Democratic Organs” (Iskra
    No. 12). The facts given above show that the assertion about
    “absence of conditions” is diametrically opposed to the
    truth. Not only at the end, but even in the mid-nineties,
    all the conditions existed for other work, besides the struggle
    for petty demands — all the conditions except adequate training
    of leaders. Instead of frankly admitting that we, the

 

      ideologists, the leaders, lacked sufficient training — the
      Economists seek to shift the blame entirely upon the “absence of
      conditions”, upon the effect of material environment that
      determines the road from which no ideologist will be able to
      divert the movement. What is this but slavish cringing before
      spontaneity, what but the infatuation of the “ideologists” with
      their own shortcomings?—Lenin

[6]
It should be stated in passing that the praise of Rabochaya
    Mysl in November 1898, when Economism had become fully
    defined, especially abroad, emanated from the selfsame V. I, who
    very soon after became one of the editors of Rabocheye
    Dyelo. And yet Rabocheye Dyelo denied that there
    were two trends in Russian Social-Democracy, and continues to
    deny It to this day!—Lenin

[7]
The tsarist gendarmes wore blue uniforms.—Tr.

[8]
That this simile is a correct one is shown by the following
    characteristic fact. When, after the arrest of the
    “Decembrists”, the news spread among the workers of the
    Schlüsselburg Highway that the discovery and arrest were
    facilitated by an agent provocateur, N. N. Mikhailov, a
    dentist, who had been in contact with a group associated with
    the “Decembrists”, the workers were so enraged that they decided
    to kill him.—Lenin

[9]
These quotations are taken from the same leading article in the first
    number of Rabochaya Mysl. One can judge from this the
    degree of theoretical training possessed by these “V. V.s of
    Russian Social-Democracy”,[38] who kept repeating the crude
    vulgarisation of “economic materialism” at a time when the
    Marxists were carrying on a literary war against the real
    Mr. V. V., who had long ago been dubbed “a past master of
    reactionary deeds” for holding similar views on the relations
    between politics and economics!—Lenin

[10]
The Germans even have a special expression,
    Nur-Gewerkschaftler, which means an advocate of the
    “pure trade union” struggle.—Lenin

[19]
    In defending its first untruth (“we do not know to which young
    comrades Axelrod referred”), Rabocheye Dyelo added a
    second, when it wrote in its Reply: “Since the review
    of The Tasks was published, tendencies have arisen, or
    become more or less clearly defined, among certain Russian
    Social-Democrats, towards economic one-sidedness, which
    represent a step backwards from the state of our movement as
    described in The Tasks” (p. 9). This, in the
    Reply, published in 1900. But the first issue
    of Rabocheye Dyelo (containing the review) appeared in
    April 1899. Did Economism really arise only in 1899?
    No. The year 1899 saw the first protest of the Russian
    Social-Democrats against Economism (the protest against the
    Credo). Economism arose in 1897, as Rabocheye
    Dyelo very well knows, for already in November
    1898, V. I. was praising Rabochaya Mysl (see “Listok”
    Rabotnika, No. 9-10).—Lenin

[20]
    The “stages theory”, or the theory of “timid zigzags”, in the
    political struggle is expressed, for example, in this article,
    in the following way: “Political demands, which in their
    character are common to the whole of Russia, should, however, at
    first (this was written in August 1900!) correspond to the
    experience gained by the given stratum (sic!) of
    workers in the economic struggle. Only [!] on the basis of this
    experience can and should political agitation be taken up,”
    etc. (p. 11). On page 4, the author, protesting against what he
    regards as the absolutely unfounded charge of Economist heresy,
    pathetically exclaims: “What Social-Democrat does not know that
    according to the theories of Marx and Engels the economic
    interests of certain classes play a decisive role in history,
    and, consequently, that particularly the proletariat’s
    struggle for its economic interests must be of paramount
    importance in its class development and struggle for
    emancipation?” (Our italics.) The word “consequently” is
    completely irrelevant. The fact that economic interests play a
    decisive role does not in the least imply that the
    economic (i.e., trade union) struggle is of prime importance;
    for the most essential, the “decisive” interests of classes can
    be satisfied only by radical political changes
    in general. In particular the fundamental economic interests of
    the proletariat can be satisfied only by a political revolution
    that will replace the dictatorship

  

of the bourgeoisie by the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. Krichevsky repeats the
    arguments of the “V. V.’s of Russian Social-Democracy” (viz.,
    that politics follows economics, etc.) and of the Bernsteinians
    of German Social-Democracy (e.g., by similar arguments Woltmann
    sought to prove that the workers must first of all acquire
    “economic power” before they can think about political
    revolution).—Lenin

    “Ein Jahr der Verwirrung” (“A Year of Confusion”) is
    the title Mehring gave to the chapter of his History of
    German Social-Democracy in which he describes the hesitancy
    and lack of determination displayed at first by the socialists in selecting
the “tactics-as-plan” for the new situation.—Lenin

The pamphlet On Agitation was written by A. Kremer (later an
    organiser of the Bund) and edited by Y. 0. Tsederbaum (Martov) in Vilno in
    1894; it was at first circulated in handwritten and hectographed copies,
    but at the end of 1897 it was printed in Geneva and supplied with a preface
    and a concluding piece by P. B. Axelrod. The pamphlet summarised the
    experiences gained in Social-Democratic work in Vilno and exerted a great
    influence on Russian Social-Democrats, since it called on them to reject
    narrow study-circle propaganda and to go over to mass agitation among the
    workers on issues of their everyday needs and demands. It exaggerated the
    role of the purely economic struggle, however, to the detriment of
    political agitation on issues of general democratic demands, and was the
    embryo of the future “Economism”. P. B. Axelrod not ed the one-sidedness
    of the “Vilno Economism” in his concluding piece to the Geneva edition;
    G. V. Plekhanov made a critical analysis of the pamphlet On
    Agitation in his Once More on Socialism and the Political
    Struggle.

    were edited by the Emancipation of Labour group. But after the majority of
    the Union Abroad went over to “Economism”, the Emancipation of Labour

Lenin's What Is To Be Done?: Trade-Unionist Politics And Social-Democratic Politics








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
What Is To Be Done?
BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT



III
Trade-Unionist Politics And Social-Democratic
      Politics

      We shall again begin by praising Rabocheye Dyelo.
      “Literature of Exposure and the Proletarian Struggle” is the
      title Martynov gave the article on his differences with
      Iskra published in Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10. He
      formulated the substance of the differences as follows: “We
      cannot confine ourselves solely to exposing the system that
      stands in its (the working-class party’s) path of
      development. We must also react to the immediate and current
      interests of the proletariat.... Iskra . . . is in fact
      an organ of revolutionary opposition that exposes the state of
      affairs in our country, particularly the political state of
      affairs.... We, however, work and shall continue to work for the
      cause of the working class in close organic contact with the
      proletarian struggle” (p. 63). One cannot help being grateful to
      Martynov for this formula. It is of outstanding general
      interest, because substantially it embraces not only our
      disagreements with Rabocheye Dyelo, but the general
      disagreement between ourselves and the Economists on the
      political struggle. We have shown that the Economists do not
      altogether repudiate “politics”, but that they are constantly
      straying from the Social-Democratic to the trade-unionist
      conception of politics. Martynov strays in precisely this way,

   
  
      and we shall therefore take his views as a model of
      Economist error on this question. As we shall endeavour to
      prove, neither the authors of the “Separate Supplement”
      to Rabochaya Mysl nor the authors of the manifesto
      issued by the Self-Emancipation Group, nor the authors of the
      Economist letter published in Iskra, No. 12, will have
      any right to complain against this choice.
  

 A. Political Agitation And Its Restriction
      By the Economists
  

      Everyone knows that the economic[1]
[1]
  To avoid misunderstanding, we must point out that here, and
  throughout this pamphlet, by economic struggle, we imply (in
      keeping with the accepted usage among us) the “practical
      economic struggle”, which Engels, in the passage quoted above,
      described as  “resistance to the capitalists”, and which in free
      countries is known as the organised-labour syndical, or trade
      union struggle.—Lenin


  struggle of the Russian workers
      underwent widespread development and consolidation
      simultaneously with the production of “literature” exposing
      economic (factory and occupational) conditions. The “leaflets”
      were devoted mainly to the exposure of the factory system, and
      very soon a veritable passion for exposures was roused among the
      workers. As soon as the workers realised that the
      Social-Democratic study circles desired to, and could, supply
      them with a new kind of leaflet that told the whole truth about
      their miserable existence, about their unbearably hard toil, and
      their lack of rights, they began to send in, actually flood us
      with, correspondence from the factories and workshops. This
      “exposure literature” created a tremendous sensation, not only
      in the particular factory exposed in the given leaflet, but in
      all the factories to which news of the, revealed facts
      spread. And since the poverty and want among the workers in the
      various enterprises and in the various trades are much the same,
      the “truth about the life of the workers” stirred everyone. Even
      among the most backward workers, a veritable passion arose to
      “get into print” — a noble passion for this rudimentary form of
      war against the whole of the present social system which is
      based upon robbery and oppression. And in the overwhelming
      majority of cases these “leaflets” were in truth a declaration
      
  

  of war, because the exposures served greatly to agitate the
      workers; they evoked among them common demands for the removal
      of the most glaring outrages and roused in them a readiness to
      support the demands with strikes. Finally, the employers
      themselves were compelled to recognise the significance of these
      leaflets as a declaration of war, so much so that in a large
      number of cases they did not even wait for the outbreak of
      hostilities. As is always the case, the mere publication of
      these exposures made them effective, and they acquired the
      significance of a strong moral influence. On more than one
      occasion, the mere appearance of a leaflet proved sufficient to
      secure the satisfaction of all or part of the demands put
      forward. In a word, economic (factory) exposures were and remain
      an important lever in the economic struggle. And they will
      continue to retain this significance as long as there is
      capitalism, which makes it necessary for the workers to defend
      themselves. Even in the most advanced countries of Europe it can
      still be seen that the exposure of abuses in some backward
      trade, or in some forgotten branch of domestic industry, serves
      as a starting-point for the awakening of class-consciousness,
      for the beginning of a trade union struggle, and for the spread
      of socialism.[2]


      The overwhelming majority of Russian Social-Democrats have of
      late been almost entirely absorbed by this work of organising
      the exposure of factory conditions. Suffice it to recall
      Rabochaya Mysl to see the extent to which they have been
      absorbed by it — so much so, indeed, that they have lost sight

    

      of the fact that this, taken by itself, is in essence
      still not Social-Democratic work, but merely trade union
      work. As a matter of fact, the exposures merely dealt with the
      relations between the workers in a given trade and
      their employers, and all they achieved was that the sellers of
      labour power learned to sell their “commodity” on better terms
      and to fight the purchasers over a purely commercial deal. These
      exposures could have served (if properly utilised by an
      organisation of revolutionaries) as a beginning and a component
      part of Social-Democratic activity; but they could also have led
      (and, given a worshipful attitude towards spontaneity, were
      bound to lead) to a “purely trade union” struggle and to a
      non-Social-Democratic working-class movement. Social-Democracy
      leads the struggle of the working class, not only for better
      terms for the sale of labour-power, but for the abolition of the
      social system that compels the propertyless to sell themselves
      to the rich. Social-Democracy represents the working class, not
      in its relation to a given group of employers alone, but in its
      relation to all classes of modern society and to the state as an
      organised political force. Hence, it follows that not only must
      Social-Democrats not confine themselves exclusively to the
      economic struggle, but that they must not allow the organisation
      of economic exposures to become the predominant part of their
      activities. We must take up actively the political education of
      the working class and the development of its political
      consciousness. Now that Zarya and
      Iskra have made the first attack upon Economism, “all
      are agreed” on this (although some agree only in words, as we
      shall soon see).
  

      The question arises, what should political education consist in?
      Can it be confined to the propaganda of working-class hostility
      to the autocracy? Of course not. It is not enough to
      explain to the workers that they are politically oppressed
      (any more than it is to explain to them that their
      interests are antagonistic to the interests of the
      employers). Agitation must be conducted with regard to every
      concrete example of this oppression (as we have begun
      to carry on agitation round concrete examples of economic
      oppression). Inasmuch as this oppression affects the most
      diverse classes of society, inasmuch as it manifests itself in
      the most varied spheres of life and activity — vocational,
      civic, personal, family,

   

  religious, scientific, etc., etc. — is
      it not evident that we shall not be fulfilling our task
      of developing the political consciousness of the workers if we
      do not undertake the organisation of the political 
  exposure of the autocracy in all its aspects? In order to 
  carry on agitation round concrete instances of oppression, these
      instances must be exposed (as it is necessary to expose factory
      abuses in order to carry on economic agitation).
  

      One might think this to be clear enough. It turns out, however,
      that it is only in words that “all” are agreed on the need to
      develop political consciousness, in all its aspects. It
      turns out that Rabocheye Dyelo, for example, far from
      tackling the task of organising (or making a start in
      organising) comprehensive political exposure, is even trying
      to drag Iskra, which has undertaken this task, away
      from it. Listen to the following: “The political struggle
      of the working class is merely [it is certainly not ‘merely’]
      the most developed, wide, and effective form of economic
      struggle” (programme of Rabocheye Dyelo, published in
      issue No. 1, p. 3). “The Social-Democrats are now confronted
      with the task of lending the economic struggle itself, as far as
      possible, a political character” (Martynov, Rabocheye
      Dyelo, No. 10, p. 42). “The economic struggle is the most
      widely applicable means of drawing the masses into active
      political struggle” (resolution adopted by the Conference of the
      Union Abroad and “amendments” thereto, Two Conferences,
      pp. 11 and 17). As the reader will observe, all these theses
      permeate Rabocheye Dyelo from its very first number to
      the latest “Instructions to the Editors”, and all of them
      evidently express a single view regarding political agitation
      and struggle. Let us examine this view from the standpoint of
      the opinion prevailing among all Economists, that political
      agitation must follow economic agitation. Is it true
      that, in general,[3] the
  economic struggle “is the most widely applicable

   

  means” of drawing the masses into the
      political struggle? It is entirely untrue. Any and
      every manifestation of police tyranny and autocratic
      outrage, not only in connection with the economic struggle, is
      not one whit less “widely applicable” as a means of 
  “drawing in” the masses. The rural superintendents and the 
  flogging of peasants, the corruption of the officials and the police
      treatment of the “common people” in the
      cities, the fight against the famine-stricken and the
      suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and
      knowledge, the extortion of taxes and the persecution of the
      religious sects, the humiliating treatment of soldiers and the
      barrack methods in the treatment of the students and liberal
      intellectuals — do all these and a thousand other similar
      manifestations of tyranny, though not directly connected with
      the “economic” struggle, represent, in general, less
      “widely applicable” means and occasions for political
      agitation and for drawing the masses into the political
      struggle? The very opposite is true. Of the sum total of cases
      in which the workers suffer (either on their own account or on
      account of those closely connected with them) from tyranny,
      violence, and the lack of rights, undoubtedly only a small
      minority represent cases of police tyranny in the trade union
      struggle as such. Why then should we, beforehand, restrict
  the scope of political agitation by declaring only one
  of the means to be “the most widely applicable”, when
      Social-Democrats must have, in addition, other, generally
      speaking, no less “widely applicable” means?
  

      In the dim and distant past (a full year ago! Rabocheye
      Dyelo wrote: “The masses begin to understand immediate
      political demands after one strike, or at all events, after
      several”,  “as soon as the government sets the police and
      gendarmerie against them” [August (No. 7) 1900,
      p. 15]. This opportunist theory of stages has now been rejected
      by the Union Abroad, which makes a concession to us by
      declaring: “There is no need whatever to conduct political
      
   

 agitation right from the beginning, exclusively on an economic
      basis” (Two Conferences, p. 11). The Union’s
      repudiation of part of its former errors will show the future
      historian of Russian Social-Democracy better than any number of
      lengthy arguments the depths to which our Economists have
      degraded socialism! But the Union Abroad must be very naive
      indeed to imagine that the abandonment of one form of
      restricting politics will induce us to agree to another
      form. Would it not be more logical to say, in this case too,
      that the economic struggle should be conducted on the widest
      possible basis, that it should always be utilised for political
      agitation, but that “there is no need whatever” to regard the
      economic struggle as the most widely applicable means
      of drawing the masses into active political struggle?
  

      The Union Abroad attaches significance to the fact that it has
      substituted the phrase “most widely applicable means” for the
      phrase “the best means” contained in one of the resolutions of
      the Fourth Congress of the Jewish Workers’ Union (Bund). We
      confess that we find it difficult to say which of these
      resolutions is the better one. In our opinion they are both
      worse. Both the Union Abroad and the Bund fall into the
      error (partly, perhaps unconsciously, under the influence of
      tradition) of giving an Economist, trade-unionist interpretation
      to politics. Whether this is done by employing the word “best”
      or the words “most widely applicable” makes no essential
      difference whatever. Had the Union Abroad said that “political
      agitation on an economic basis” is the most widely applied (not
      “applicable”) means,  it would have been right in regard to a
      certain period in the development of our Social-Democratic
      movement. It would have been right in regard to the
      Economists and to many (if not the majority) of the
      practical workers of 1898-1901; for these practical Economists
      applied political agitation (to the extent that they
      applied it at all) almost exclusively on an economic
      basis. Political agitation on such lines was recognised
      and, as we have seen, even recommended by Rabochaya Mysl and the
      Self-Emancipation Group. Rabocheye Dyelo should have
      strongly condemned the fact that the useful work of
      economic agitation was accompanied by the harmful restriction of
      the political struggle; instead, it declares the means most
      widely applied (by the Economists) to be the most

   

  widely applicable! It is not surprising that when we
      call these people Economists, they can do nothing but pour every
      manner of abuse upon us; call us “mystifiers”, 
  “disrupters”, “papal nuncios”, and

  “slanderers”[4] go complaining to the whole world
      that we have mortally offended them; and declare almost on oath
      that “not a single Social-Democratic organisation is now tinged
      with Economism”.[5] Oh, those evil, slanderous
      politicians! They must have deliberately invented this
      Economism, out of sheer hatred of mankind, in order mortally to
      offend other people.
  

      What concrete, real meaning attaches to Martynov’s words when he
      sets before Social-Democracy the task of “lending the economic
      struggle itself a political character”? The economic struggle is
      the collective struggle of the workers against their employers
      for better terms in the sale of their labour-power, for
      better living and working conditions. This struggle is
      necessarily a trade union struggle, because working conditions
      differ greatly in different trades, and, consequently, the
      struggle to improve them can only be conducted on the
      basis of trade organisations (in the Western countries, through
      trade unions; in Russia, through temporary trade associations
      and through leaflets, etc.). Lending “the economic struggle
      itself a political character” means, therefore, striving to
      secure satisfaction of these trade
      demands, the improvement of working conditions in each separate
      trade by means of “legislative and administrative measures” (as
      Martynov puts it on the ensuing page of his article,
      p. 43). This is precisely what all workers’ trade unions do and
      always have done. Read the works of the soundly scientific (and
      “soundly” opportunist) Mr. and Mrs. Webb and you will see that
      the British trade unions long ago recognised, and have long been
      carrying out, the task of “lending the economic struggle itself
      a political character”; they have long been fighting for the
      right to strike, for the removal of all legal hindrances to the
      co-operative and trade union movements, for laws to protect
      women and children, for the improvement of labour conditions by
      means of health and factory legislation, etc.
  


      Thus, the pompous phrase about “lending the economic struggle
      itself a political character”, which sounds so
      “terrifically” profound and revolutionary, serves as a screen to
      conceal what is in fact the traditional striving to
      degrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of trade
      union politics. Under the guise of rectifying the onesidedness
      of Iskra, which, it is alleged, places “the
      revolutionising of dogma higher than the revolutionising of
      life”,[6] we
  are presented with the struggle for economic reforms
      as if it were something entirely new. In point of fact, the
      phrase “lending the economic struggle itself a political
      character” means nothing more than the struggle for economic
      reforms. Martynov himself might have come to this simple
      conclusion, had he pondered over the significance of his own
      words. “Our Party,” he says, training his heaviest guns on
      Iskra, “could and should have presented concrete
      demands to the government for legislative and administrative
      measures against economic exploitation, unemployment, famine,
      etc.” (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, pp. 42-43). Concrete
      demands for measures — does not this mean demands for social
      reforms? Again we ask the impartial reader: Are we slandering
      the Rabocheye Dyelo-ites (may I be forgiven for this
      awkward, currently used designation!) by calling them concealed
      Bernsteinians when, as their point of disagreement with
      Iskra, they advance their thesis on the necessity of
      struggling for economic reforms?
  

      Revolutionary Social-Democracy has always included the struggle
      for reforms as part of its activities. But it utilises
      “economic” agitation for the purpose of presenting to the
      government, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also
      (and primarily) the demand that it cease to be an autocratic
      government. Moreover, it considers it its duty to present this
      demand to the government on the basis, not of the economic
      struggle alone, but of all manifestations in general of
      public and political life. In a word, it subordinates the

    

      struggle for reforms, as the part to the whole, to the
      revolutionary struggle for freedom and for socialism.  Martynov,
      however, resuscitates the theory of stages in a new form and
      strives to prescribe, as it were, an exclusively economic path
      of development for the political struggle. By advancing at this
      moment, when the revolutionary movement is on the upgrade, an
      alleged special “task” of struggling for reforms, he is dragging
      the Party backwards and is playing into the hands of both
      “Economist” and liberal opportunism.
  

      To proceed. Shamefacedly hiding the struggle for reforms behind
      the pompous thesis of “lending the economic struggle itself a
      political character”, Martynov advanced, as if it were a special
      point, exclusively economic (indeed, exclusively
      factory) reforms. As to the reason for his doing that,
      we do not know it. Carelessness, perhaps? Yet if he had in mind
      something else besides “factory” reforms, then the whole of his
      thesis, which we have cited, loses all sense. Perhaps he did it
      because he considers it possible and probable that the
      government will make “concessions” only in the economic
  sphere?[7] If so,
      then it is a strange delusion. Concessions are also possible and
      are made in the sphere of legislation concerning flogging,
      passports, land redemption payments, religious sects, the
      censorship, etc., etc. “Economic” concessions (or
      pseudo-concessions) are, of course, the cheapest and most
      advantageous from the government’s point of view, because by
      these means it hopes to win the confidence of the working
      masses. For this very reason, we Social-Democrats must
      not under any circumstances or in any way whatever create
      grounds for the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach
      greater value to economic reforms, or that we regard them as
      being particularly important, etc. “Such demands,” writes
      Martynov, speaking of the concrete demands for legislative and
      administrative measures referred to above, “would not be merely
      a hollow sound, because, promising certain palpable results,
      they might be actively supported by the working masses....” We
      are not Economists,

    

  oh no! We only cringe as slavishly before
      the “palpableness” of concrete results as do the Bernsteins, the
      Prokopoviches, the Struves, the R.M.s, and tutti
      quanti! We only wish to make it understood (together with
      Nartsis Tuporylov) that all which “does not promise palpable
      results” is merely a “hollow sound”! We are only trying to argue
      as if the working masses were incapable (and had not already
      proved their capabilities, notwithstanding those who ascribe
      their own philistinism to them) of actively supporting every
  protest against the autocracy, even if it promises
      absolutely no palpable results whatever!


      Let us take, for example, the very “measures” for the relief of
      unemployment and the famine that Martynov himself
      advances. Rabocheye Dyelo is engaged, judging by what
      it has promised, in drawing up and elaborating a programme of
      “concrete [in the form of bills?] demands for legislative and
      administrative measures”, “promising palpable results”, while
      Iskra, which “constantly places the revolutionising of
      dogma higher than the revolutionising of life”, has tried to
      explain the inseparable connection between unemployment and the
      whole capitalist system, has given warning that “famine is
      coming”, has exposed the police “fight against the
      famine-stricken”, and the outrageous “provisional penal
      servitude regulations”; and Zarya has published a
      special reprint, in the form of an agitational pamphlet, of a
      section of its “Review of Home Affairs”, dealing with the
      famine.[8] But 
  good God! How “onesided” were these incorrigibly narrow and
      orthodox doctrinaires, how deaf to the calls of “life itself”!
      Their articles contained — oh horror! — not a single,
      can you imagine it? not a single “concrete demand” “promising
      palpable results”! Poor doctrinaires! They ought to be sent to
      Krichevsky and Martynov to be taught that tactics are a process
      of growth, of that which grows, etc., and that the economic
      struggle itself should be given a political character!
  

      “In addition to its immediate revolutionary significance, the
      economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the
      government [“economic struggle against the
      government”!] has also this significance: it constantly brings
      home

    

  to the workers the fact that they have no political rights”
      (Martynov, p. 44). We quote this passage, not in order to repeat
      for the hundredth and thousandth time what has been said above,
      but in order to express particular thanks to Martynov for this
      excellent new formula: “the economic struggle of the workers
      against the employers and the government”. What a gem! With what
      inimitable skill and mastery in eliminating all partial
      disagreements and shades of differences among Economists this
      clear and concise proposition expresses the quintessence 
  of Economism, from summoning the workers “to the political
      struggle, which they carry on in the general interest, for the
      improvement of the conditions of all the workers”,[9] continuing through
      the theory of stages, and ending in the resolution of the
      Conference on the “most widely applicable”, etc. “Economic
      struggle against the government” is precisely trade-unionist
      politics, which is still very far from being Social-Democratic
      politics.
  

 B. How Martynov Rendered Plekhanov More Profound
  

      “What a large number of Social-Democratic Lomonosovs have
      appeared among us lately!” observed a comrade one day, having in
      mind the astonishing propensity of many who are inclined toward
      Economism to, arrive, “necessarily, by their own under
      standing”, at great truths (e.g., that the economic struggle
      stimulates the workers to ponder over their lack of rights) and
      in doing so to ignore, with the supreme contempt of born
      geniuses, all that has been produced by the antecedent
      development of revolutionary thought and of the revolutionary
      movement. Lomonosov-Martynov is precisely such a born genius. We
      need but glance at his article “Urgent Questions” to see how by
      “his own understanding” he arrives at what was long ago
      said by Axelrod (of whom our Lomonosov, naturally, says not a
      word); how, for instance, he is beginning to understand
      that we cannot ignore the opposition of such or such strata of
      the bourgeoisie (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 9, pp. 61, 62,
      71; compare this with Rabocheye Dyelo’s Reply to Axelrod,
      pp. 22, 23-24),

    

  etc. But alas, he is only “arriving” and is only
      “beginning”, not more than that, for so little has he understood
      Axelrod’s ideas, that hetalks about “the economic struggle
      against the employers and the government”. For three years
      (1898-1901) Rabocheye Dyelo has tried hard to
      understand Axelrod, but has so far not understood him! Can one
      of the reasons be that Social-Democracy, “like mankind”, always
      sets itself only tasks that can be achieved?
      

      But the Lomonosovs are distinguished not only by their ignorance
      of many things (that would be but half misfortune!), but also by
      their unawareness of their own ignorance. Now this is a real
      misfortune; and it is this misfortune that prompts them without
      further ado to attempt to render Plekhanov “more profound”.
  


      “Much water,” Lomonosov-Martynov says, “has flowed 
  under the bridge since Plekhanov wrote his book (Tasks of the
      Socialists in the Fight Against the Famine in Russia). The
      Social-Democrats who for a decade led the economic struggle of
      the working class ... have failed as yet to lay down a broad
      theoretical basis for Party tactics. This question has now come
      to a head, and if we should wish to lay down such a theoretical
      basis, we should certainly have to deepen considerably the
      principles of tactics developed at one time by Plekhanov.... Our
      present definition of the distinction between propaganda and
      agitation would have to be different from Plekhanov’s (Martynov
      has just quoted PIekhanov’s words: “A propagandist presents many
      ideas to one or a few persons; an agitator presents only one or
      a few ideas, but he presents them to a mass of people.”) By
      propaganda we would understand the revolutionary explanation of
      the present social system, entire or in its partial
      manifestations, whether that be done in a form intelligible to
      individuals or to broad masses. By agitation, in the strict
      sense of the word (sic!), we would understand the call
      upon the masses to undertake definite, concrete actions and the
      promotion of the direct revolutionary intervention of the
      proletariat in social life.”
  


      We congratulate Russian-and international-Social-Democracy on
      having found, thanks to Martynov, a new terminology, more strict
      and more profound. Hitherto we thought (with Plekhanov, and with
      all the leaders of the international working class movement)
      that the propagandist, dealing with, say, the question of
      unemployment, must explain the capitalistic nature of crises,
      the cause of their inevitability in modern society, the
      necessity for the transformation of this society into a
      socialist society, etc. In a word, he must present “many ideas”,
      so many, indeed, that they will be understood as an integral

   

      whole only by a (comparatively) few persons. The agitator,
      however, speaking on the same subject, will take as an
      illustration a fact that is most glaring and most widely known
      to his audience, say, the death of an unemployed worker’s family
      from starvation, the growing impoverishment, etc., and,
      utilising this fact, known to all, will direct his efforts to
      presenting a single idea to the “masses”, e.g., the
      senselessness of the contradiction between the increase of
      wealth and the increase of poverty; he will strive to
      rouse discontent and indignation among the masses against
      this crying injustice, leaving a more complete explanation of
      this contradiction to the propagandist. Consequently, the
      propagandist operates chiefly by means of the printed
  word; the agitator by means of the spoken word.
  The propagandist requires qualities different from
      those of the agitator. Kautsky and Lafargue, for example, we
      term propagandists; Bebel and Guesde we term agitators. To
      single out a third sphere, or third function, of practical
      activity, and to include in this function “the call upon the
      masses to undertake definite concrete actions”, is sheer
      nonsense, because the “call”, as a single act, either naturally
      and inevitably supplements the theoretical treatise,
      propagandist pamphlet, and agitational speech, or represents a
      purely executive function. Let us take, for example, the
      struggle the German Social-Democrats are now waging against the
      corn duties. The theoreticians write research works on tariff
      policy, with the “call”, say, to struggle for commercial
      treaties and for Free Trade. The propagandist does the same
      thing in the periodical press, and the agitator in public
      speeches. At the present time, the “concrete action” of the
      masses takes the form of signing petitions to the Reichstag
      against raising the corn duties. The call for this action comes
      indirectly from the theoreticians, the propagandists, and the
      agitators, and, directly, from the workers who take the petition
      lists to the factories and to private homes for the gathering of
      signatures. According to the “Martynov terminology”, Kautsky and
      Bebel are both propagandists, while those who solicit the
      signatures are agitators. Isn’t it clear?
  

      The German example recalled to my mind the German word which,
      literally translated, means “Ballhorning”. Johann Ballhorn, a

   

      Leipzig publisher of the sixteenth century, published a child’s
      reader in which, as was the custom, he introduced a drawing of a
      cock, but a cock without spurs and with a couple of eggs lying
      near it. On the cover he printed the legend, “Revised
  edition by Johann Ballhorn”. Ever since then, the Germans
      describe any “revision” that is really a worsening as
      “ballhorning”. And one cannot help recalling Ballhorn upon
      seeing how the Martynovs try to render Plekhanov “more
      profound”.
  

      Why did our Lomonosov “invent” this confusion? In order to
      illustrate how Iskra “devotes attention only to one
      side of the case, just as Pleklianov did a decade and a half
      ago” (39). “With Iskra, propagandist tasks force
      agitational tasks into the background, at least for the present”
      (52). If we translate this last proposition from the language of
      Martynov into ordinary human language (because mankind has not
      yet managed to learn the newly-invented terminology), we shall
      get the following: with Iskra, the tasks of political
      propaganda and political agitation force into the background the
      task of “presenting to the government concrete demands for
      legislative and administrative measures” that “promise certain
      palpable results” (or demands for social reforms, that is, if we
      are permitted once again to employ the old terminology of the
      old mankind not yet grown to Martynov’s level). We suggest that
      the reader compare this thesis with the following tirade:
  


      “What also astonishes us in these programmes [the programmes
      advanced by revolutionary Social-Democrats] is their constant
      stress upon the benefits of workers’ activity in parliament
      (non-existent in Russia), though they completely ignore (thanks
      to their revolutionary nihilism) the importance of workers’
      participation in the legislative manufacturers’ assemblies on
      factory affairs [which do exist in Russia] ... or at least the
      importance of workers’ participation in municipal bodies....”
  


      The author of this tirade expresses in a somewhat more
      forthright and clearer manner the very idea which
      Lomonosov-Martynov discovered by his own understanding. The
      author is R. M., in the “Separate Supplement” to Rabochaya
      Mysl (p. 15).
  


C. Political Exposures And “Training
  In Revolutionary Activity”
  

      In advancing against Iskra his theory of “raising the
      activity of the working masses”, Martynov actually betrayed an
      urge to belittle that activity, for he declared the
      very economic struggle before which all economists grovel to be
      the preferable, particularly important, and “most widely
      applicable” means of rousing this activity and its broadest
      field. This error is characteristic, precisely in that it is by
      no means peculiar to Martynov. In reality, it is possible to
      “raise the activity of the working masses” only when
      this activity is not restricted to “political agitation
      on an economic basis”. A basic condition for the necessary
      expansion of political agitation is the organisation of
      comprehensive political exposure. In no way
      except by means of such exposures can the masses be
      trained in political consciousness and revolutionary
      activity. Hence, activity of this kind is one of the most
      important functions of international Social-Democracy as a
      whole, for even political freedom does not in any way eliminate
      exposures; it merely shifts somewhat their sphere of
      direction. Thus, the German party is especially strengthening
      its positions and spreading its influence, thanks particularly
      to the untiring energy with which it is conducting its campaign
      of political exposure. Working-class consciousness cannot be
      genuine political consciousness unless the workers are trained
      to respond to all cases of tyranny, oppression,
      violence, and abuse, no matter what class is affected
      — unless they are trained, moreover, to respond from a
      Social-Democratic point of view and no other. The consciousness
      of the working masses cannot be genuine class-consciousness,
      unless the workers learn, from concrete, and above all from
      topical, political facts and events to observe every
  other social class in all the manifestations of
      its intellectual, ethical, and political life; unless they learn
      to apply in practice the materialist analysis and the
      materialist estimate of all aspects of the life and
      activity of all classes, strata, and groups of the
      population. Those who concentrate the attention, observation,
      and consciousness of the working class exclusively, or even
      mainly, upon itself alone are not Social-Democrats; for the
      self-knowledge of the working class is indissolubly bound up,
      not solely with a fully clear theoretical understanding — or

   

  rather, not so much with the theoretical, as with the practical,
      understanding — of the relationships between all the
      various classes of modern society, acquired through the
      experience of political life. For this reason the conception of
      the economic struggle as the most widely applicable means of
      drawing the masses into the political movement, which our
      Economists preach, is so extremely harmful and reactionary in
      its practical significance. In order to become a
      Social-Democrat, the worker must have a clear picture in his
      mind of the economic nature and the social and political
      features of the landlord and the priest, the high state official
      and the peasant, the student and the vagabond; he must know
      their strong and weak points; he must grasp the meaning of all
      the catchwords and sophisms by which each class and each stratum
      camouflages its selfish strivings and its real “inner
      workings”; he must understand what interests are reflected by
      certain institutions and certain laws and how they are
      reflected. But this “clear picture” cannot be obtained from any
      book. It can be obtained only from living examples and from
      exposures that follow close upon what is going on about us at a
      given moment; upon what is being discussed, in whispers perhaps,
      by each one in his own way; upon what finds expression in such
      and such events, in such and such statistics, in such and such
      court sentences, etc., etc. These comprehensive political
      exposures are an essential and fundamental condition
      for training the masses in revolutionary activity.
  

      Why do the Russian workers still manifest little revolutionary
      activity in response to the brutal treatment of the people by
      the police, the persecution of religious sects, the flogging of
      peasants, the outrageous censorship, the torture of soldiers,
      the persecution of the most innocent cultural undertakings, etc.? Is it 
  because the “economic struggle” does not “stimulate”
      them to this, because such activity does not “promise palpable
      results”, because it produces little that is “positive”? To
      adopt such an opinion, we repeat, is merely to direct the charge
      where it does not belong, to blame the working masses for one’s
      own philistinism (or Bernsteinism). We must blame ourselves, our
      lagging behind the mass movement, for still being unable to
      organise

    

  sufficiently wide, striking, and rapid exposures of all
      the shameful outrages. When we do that (and we must and can do
      it), the most backward worker will understand, or will
      feel, that the students and religious sects, the peasants
      and the authors are being abused and outraged by those same dark
      forces that are oppressing and crushing him at every step of his
      life. Feeling that, he himself will be filled with an
      irresistible desire to react, and he will know how to hoot the
      censors one day, on another day to demonstrate outside the house
      of a governor who has brutally suppressed a peasant uprising, on
      still another day to teach a lesson to the gendarmes in
      surplices who are doing the work of the Holy Inquisition,
      etc. As yet we have done very little, almost nothing, to
      bring before the working masses prompt exposures on all
      possible issues. Many of us as yet do not recognise this as our
      bounden duty but trail spontaneously in the wake of the
      “drab everyday struggle”, in the narrow confines of factory
      life. Under such circumstances to say that “Iskra
      displays a tendency to minimise the significance of the forward
      march of the drab everyday struggle in comparison with the
      propaganda of brilliant and complete ideas” (Martynov, op. cit.,
      p. 61), means to drag the Party back, to defend and glorify our
      unpreparedness and backwardness.
  

      As for calling the masses to action, that will come of itself as
      soon as energetic political agitation, live and striking
      exposures come into play. To catch some criminal red-handed and
      immediately to brand him publicly in all places is of itself far
      more effective than any number of “calls”; the effect very often
      is such as will make it impossible to tell exactly who it was
      that “called” upon the masses and who suggested this or that
      plan of demonstration, etc. Calls for action, not in the
      general, but in the concrete, sense of the term can be made only
      at the place of action; only those who themselves go into
      action, and do so immediately, can sound such calls. Our
      business as Social-Democratic publicists is to deepen, expand,
      and intensify political exposures and political agitation.
  

      A word in passing about “calls to action”. The only
      newspaper which prior to the spring events
      called upon the workers to intervene actively in a
      matter that certainly did not promise any palpable
      results whatever for the workers, i.e.,

   

  the drafting of the
      students into the army, was Iskra. Immediately after
      the publication of the order of January 11, on “drafting the 183
      students into the army”, Iskra published an article on
      the matter (in its February issue, No. 2),[10] and, before 
  any demonstration was begun, forthwith called upon
      “the workers to go to the aid of the students”, called upon the
      “people” openly to take up the government’s arrogant
      challenge. We ask: how is the remarkable fact to be explained
      that although Martynov talks so much about “calls to action”,
      and even suggests “calls to action” as a special form of
      activity, he said not a word about this call? After
      this, was it not sheer philistinism on Martynov’s part to allege
      that Iskra was one-sided because it did not
      issue sufficient “calls” to struggle for demands “promising
      palpable results”?
  

      Our Economists, including Rabocheye Dyelo, were
      successful because they adapted themselves to the backward
      workers. But the Social-Democratic worker, the revolutionary
      worker (and the number of such workers is growing) will
      indignantly reject all this talk about struggle for demands
      “promising palpable results”, etc., because he will understand
      that this is only a variation of the old song about adding a
      kopek to the ruble.  Such a worker will say to his counsellors
      from Rabochaya Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelo: you
      are busying yourselves in vain, gentlemen, and shirking your
      proper duties, by meddling with such excessive zeal in a job
      that we can very well manage ourselves. There is nothing clever
      in your assertion that the Social-Democrats’ task is to lend the
      economic struggle itself a political character; that is only the
      beginning, it is not the main task of the Social-Democrats. For
      all over the world, including Russia, the police themselves
      often take the initiative in lending the economic struggle
      a political character, and the workers themselves learn to
      understand whom the government supports.[11]
[11]
  The demand “to lend the economic struggle itself a political
  character” most strikingly expresses subservience to
      spontaneity in the sphere of political activity. Very often
      the economic struggle spontaneously assumes a political
      character, that is to say, without the intervention of the
      “revolutionary bacilli — the intelligentsia”, without the

  

  intervention of the class-conscious Social-Democrats. The
      economic struggle of the English workers, for instance, also
      assumed a political character without any intervention on the
      part of the socialists. The task of the Social-Democrats,
      however, is not exhausted by political agitation on an economic
      basis; their task is to convert trade-unionist politics
      into Social-Democratic political struggle, to utilise
      the sparks of political consciousness which the economic
      struggle generates among the workers, for the purpose of
      raising the workers to the level of
      Social-Democratic political consciousness. The
      Martynovs, however, instead of raising and stimulating the
      spontaneously awakening political consciousness of the workers,
      bow to spontaneity and repeat over and over ad
      nauseam, that the economic struggle “Impels” the workers to
      realise their own lack of political rights. It is unfortunate,
      gentlemen, that the spontaneously awakening trade-unionist
      political consciousness does not “impel” you to an
      understanding of your Social-Democratic tasks.—Lenin


   The “economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the

   

      government”, about which you make as much fuss as if you had
      discovered a new America, is being waged in all parts of Russia,
      even the most remote, by the workers themselves who have heard
      about strikes, but who have heard almost nothing about
      socialism. The “activity” you want to stimulate among us
      workers, by advancing concrete demands that promise palpable
      results, we are already displaying and in our everyday, limited
      trade union work we put forward these concrete demands, very
      often without any assistance whatever from the
      intellectuals. But such activity is not enough for us;
      we are not children to be fed on the thin gruel of “economic”
      politics alone; we want to know everything that others know, we
      want to learn the details of all aspects of political
      life and to take part actively in every single
      political event. In order that we may do this, the intellectuals
      must talk to us less of what we already know.[12] and tell us more
      about what we do not yet know and what we can never learn from

   

      our factory and “economic” experience, namely, political
      knowledge. You intellectuals can acquire this knowledge, and it
      is your duty to bring it to us in a hundred- and a
      thousand-fold greater measure than you have done up to now; and
      you must bring it to us, not only in the form of discussions,
      pamphlets, and articles (which very often —  pardon our
      frankness — are rather dull), but precisely in the form of
      vivid exposures of what our government and our
      governing classes are doing at this very moment in all spheres
      of life. Devote more zeal to carrying out this duty and talk
      less about “raising the activity of the working
      masses”. We are far more active than you think, and we are
      quite able to support, by open street fighting, even demands
      that do not promise any “palpable results” whatever. It is not
      for you to “raise” our activity, because activity is
      precisely the thing you yourselves lack. Bow less in
      subservience to spontaneity, and think more about raising your
      own activity, gentlemen!
  

D. What Is There In Common Between Economism
      and Terrorism?

      In the last footnote we cited the opinion of an Economist and of
      a non-Social -Democratic terrorist, who showed themselves to be
      accidentally in agreement. Speaking generally, however, there is
      not an accidental, but a necessary, inherent connection between
      the two, of which we shall have need to speak later, and which
      must be mentioned here in connection with the question of

   

      education for revolutionary activity. The Economists and the
      root, namely, subservience to spontaneity, with which
      we dealt in the preceding chapter as a general phenomenon and
      which we shall now examine in relation to its effect upon
      political activity and the political struggle. At first sight,
      our assertion may appear paradoxical, so great is the difference
      between those who stress the “drab everyday struggle” and those
      who call for the most self sacrificing struggle of
      individuals. But this is no paradox. The Economists and the
      terrorists merely bow to different poles of spontaneity; the
      Economists bow to the spontaneity of “the labour movement pure
      and simple”, while the terrorists bow to the spontaneity of the
      passionate indignation of intellectuals, who lack the ability or
      opportunity to connect the revolutionary struggle and the
      working-class movement into an integral whole. It is difficult
      indeed for those who have lost their belief, or who have never
      believed, that this is possible, to find some outlet for their
      indignation and revolutionary energy other than terror. Thus,
      both forms of subservience to spontaneity we have mentioned are
      nothing but the beginning of the implementation of the
      notorious Credo programme: Let the workers wage their
      “economic struggle against the employers and the government” (we
      apologise to the author of the Credo for expressing her
      views in Martynov’s words. We think we have a right to do so
      since the Credo, too, says that in the economic
      struggle the workers "come up against the political regime and
      let the intellectuals conduct the political struggle by their
      own efforts — with the aid of terror, of course! This is an
      absolutely logical and inevitable conclusion which must
      be insisted on — even though those who are beginning
      to carry out this programme do not themselves realise
      that it is inevitable. Political activity has its logic quite
      apart from the consciousness of those who, with the best
      intentions, call either for terror or for lending the economic
      struggle itself a political character. The road to hell is paved
      with good intentions, and, in this case, good intentions cannot
      save one from being spontaneously drawn “along the line of least
      resistance”, along the line of the purely bourgeois
      Credo programme. Surely it is no accident either that many

  

      Russian liberals — avowed liberals and liberals that wear the
      mask of Marxism — whole-heartedly sympathise with terror and
      try to foster the terrorist moods that have surged up in the
      present time.
  

      The formation of the Revolutionary-Socialist Svoboda
  Group which set itself the aim of helping the working-class
      movement in every possible way, but which included in its
      programme terror, and emancipation, so to speak, from
      Social-Democracy — once again confirmed the remarkable
      perspicacity of P. B. Axelrod, who literally foretold
      these results of Social-Democratic waverings as far back as
      the end of 1897 (Present Tasks and Tactics), when he
      outlined his famous “two perspectives”. All the subsequent
      disputes and disagreements among Russian Social-Democrats are
      contained, like a plant in the seed, in these two
      perspectives.[13]


      From this point of view it also becomes clear why Rabocheye
      Dyelo, unable to withstand the spontaneity of Economism,
      has likewise been unable to withstand the spontaneity of
      terrorism. It is highly interesting to note here the specific
      arguments that Svoboda has advanced in defence of
      terrorism. It “completely denies” the deterrent role of
      terrorism (The Regeneration of Revolutionism, p. 64),
      but instead stresses its “excitative significance”. This is
      characteristic, first, as representing one of the stages of the
      breakup and decline of the traditional (pre-Social-Democratic)
      cycle of ideas which insisted upon terrorism. The admission that

    

      the government cannot now be “terrified” and hence disrupted, by
      terror, is tantamount to a complete condemnation of terror as a
      system of struggle, as a sphere of activity sanctioned by the
      programme. Secondly, it is still more characteristic as an
      example of the failure to understand our immediate tasks in
      regard to “education for revolutionary activity”. Svoboda
  advocates terror as a means of “exciting” the working-class
      movement and of giving it a “strong impetus”. It is difficult to
      imagine an argument that more thoroughly disproves itself. Are
      there not enough outrages committed in Russian life without
      special “excitants” having to be invented? On the other hand, is
      it not obvious that those who are not, and cannot be, roused to
      excitement even by Russian tyranny will stand by “twiddling
      their thumbs” and watch a handful of terrorists engaged in
      single combat with the government? The fact is that the working
      masses are roused to a high pitch of excitement by the social
      evils in Russian life, but we are unable to gather, if one may
      so put it, and concentrate all these drops and streamlets of
      popular resentment that are brought forth to a far larger extent
      than we imagine by the conditions of Russian life, and that must
      be combined into a single gigantic torrent. That this can be
      accomplished is irrefutably proved by the enormous growth of the
      working-class movement and the eagerness, noted above, with
      which the workers clamour for political literature. On the other
      hand, calls for terror and calls to lend the economic struggle
      itself a political character are merely two different forms of
      evading the most pressing duty now resting upon Russian
      revolutionaries, namely, the organisation of comprehensive
      political agitation. Svoboda desires to substitute
  terror for agitation, openly admitting that “as soon as
      intensified and strenuous agitation is begun among the masses
      the excitative function of terror will be ended” (The
      Regeneration of Revolutionism, p. 68). This proves
      precisely that both the terrorists and the Economists
      underestimate the revolutionary activity of the masses,
      despite the striking evidence of the events that took place in
      the spring,[14] and 
  whereas the one group goes out in

  

  search of artificial “excitants”, the other talks about
      “concrete demands”. But both fail to devote sufficient attention
      to the development of their own activity in political
      agitation and in the organisation of political exposures. And no
      other work can serve as a substitute for this task
      either at the present time or at any other.
  

E. The Working Class As Vanguard Fighter
      For Democracy

      We have seen that the conduct of the broadest political
      agitation and, consequently, of all-sided political exposures is
      an absolutely necessary and a paramount task of our
      activity, if this activity is to be truly
      Social-Democratic. However, we arrived at this conclusion solely
      on the grounds of the pressing needs of the working class for
      political knowledge and political training. But such a
      presentation of the question is too narrow, for it ignores the
      general democratic tasks of Social-Democracy, in particular of
      present-day Russian Social-Democracy. In order to explain the
      point more concretely we shall approach the subject from an
      aspect that is “nearest” to the Economist, namely, from the
      practical aspect. “Everyone agrees” that it is necessary to
      develop the political consciousness of the working class. The
      question is, how that is to be done and what is
      required to do it. The economic struggle merely “impels” the
      workers to realise the government’s attitude towards the working
      class.  Consequently, however much we may try to “lend
      the economic, struggle itself a political character”, we
      shall never be able to develop the political consciousness
      of the workers (to the level of Social-Democratic political
      consciousness) by keeping within the framework of the economic
      struggle, for that framework is too narrow. The
      Martynov formula has some value for us, not because it
      illustrates Martynov’s aptitude for confusing things, but
      because it pointedly expresses the basic error that all the
      Economists commit, namely, their conviction that it is possible
      to develop the class political consciousness of the workers
      from within, so to speak, from their economic struggle,
      i.e., by making this struggle the exclusive (or, at least, the

   

      main) starting-point, by making it the exclusive (or, at least,
      the main) basis. Such a view is radically wrong. Piqued by our
      polemics against them, the Economists refuse to ponder deeply
      over the origins of these disagreements, with the result that we
      simply cannot understand one another.  It is as if we spoke in
      different tongues.
  

      Class political consciousness can be brought to the workers
      only from without, that is, only from outside the
      economic struggle, from outside the sphere of relations between
      workers and employers. The sphere from which alone it is
      possible to obtain this knowledge is the sphere of relationships
      of all classes and strata to the state and the
      government, the sphere of the interrelations between all
  classes. For that reason, the reply to the question as to
      what must be done to bring political knowledge to the workers
      cannot be merely the answer with which, in the majority of
      cases, the practical workers, especially those inclined towards
      Economism, mostly content themselves, namely: “To go among the
      workers.” To bring political knowledge to the workers
  the Social Democrats must go among all classes of the
      population; they must dispatch units of their army in
      all directions.
  

      We deliberately select this blunt formula, we deliberately
      express ourselves in this sharply simplified manner, not because
      we desire to indulge in paradoxes, but in order to “impel” the
      Economists to a realisation of their tasks which they
      unpardonably ignore, to suggest to them strongly the difference
      between trade-unionist and Social-Democratic politics, which
      they refuse to understand. We therefore beg the reader not to
      get wrought up, but to hear us patiently to the end.
  

      Let us take the type of Social-Democratic study circle that has
      become most widespread in the past few years and examine its
      work. It has “contacts with the workers” and rests content with
      this, issuing leaflets in which abuses in the factories, the
      government’s partiality towards the capitalists, and the tyranny
      of the police are strongly condemned. At workers’ meetings the
      discussions never, or rarely ever, go beyond the limits of these
      subjects. Extremely rare are the lectures and discussions held
      on the history of the revolutionary movement, on questions of
      the government’s home and foreign policy, on questions of the
      economic evolution of Russia and of Europe, on the position of

   

      the various classes in modern society, etc. As to systematically
      acquiring and extending contact with other classes of society,
      no one even dreams of that. In fact, the ideal leader, as the
      majority of the members of such circles picture him, is
      something far more in the nature of a trade union secretary than
      a socialist political leader. For the secretary of any, say
      English, trade union always helps the workers to carry on the
      economic struggle, he helps them to expose factory abuses,
      explains the injustice of the laws and of measures that hamper
      the freedom to strike and to picket (i. e., to warn all and
      sundry that a strike is proceeding at a certain factory),
      explains the partiality of arbitration court judges who belong
      to the bourgeois classes, etc., etc. In a word, every trade
      union secretary conducts and helps to conduct “the economic
      struggle against the employers and the government”. It cannot be
      too strongly maintained that this is still not
      Social-Democracy, that the Social-Democrat’s ideal should not be
      the trade union secretary, but the tribune of the
      people, who is able to react to every manifestation of
      tyranny and oppression, no matter where it appears, no matter
      what stratum or class of the people it affects; who is able to
      generalise all these manifestations and produce a single picture
      of police violence and capitalist exploitation; who is able to
      take advantage of every event, however small, in order to set
      forth before all his socialist convictions and his
      democratic demands, in order to clarify for all and
      everyone the world-historic significance of the struggle for the
      emancipation of the proletariat. Compare, for example, a leader
      like Robert Knight (the well-known secretary and leader of the
      Boiler-Makers’ Society, one of the most powerful trade unions in
      England), with Wilhelm Liebknecht, and try to apply to them the
      contrasts that Martynov draws in his controversy with
      Iskra. You will see — I am running through Martynov’s
      article — that Robert Knight engaged more in “calling the
      masses to certain concrete actions” (Martynov, op. cit., p. 39),
      while Willielin Liebknecht engaged more in “the revolutionary
      elucidation of the whole of the present system or partial
      manifestations of it” (38-39); that Robert Knight “formulated
      the immediate demands of the proletariat and indicated the means

   

  by which they can be achieved” (41), whereas Wilhelm Liebknecht,
      while doing this, did not hold back from “simultaneously guiding
      the activities of various opposition strata”, “dictating a
      positive programme of action for them”[15] (41); that Robert
      Knight strove “as far as possible to lend the economic struggle
      itself a political character” (42) and was excellently able “to
      submit to the government concrete demands promising certain
      palpable results” (43), whereas Liebknecht engaged to a much
      greater degree in “one-sided” “exposures” (40); that Robert
      Knight attached more significance to the “forward march of the
      drab everyday struggle” (61), whereas Liebknecht attached more
      significance to the “propaganda of brilliant and completed
      ideas” (61); that Liebknecht converted the paper he was
      directing into “an organ of revolutionary opposition that
      exposed the state of affairs in our country, particularly the
      political state of affairs, insofar as it affected the interests
      of the most varied strata of the population” (63), whereas
      Robert Knight “worked for the cause of the working class in
      close organic connection with the proletarian struggle” (63) —
      if by “close and organic connection” is meant the subservience
      to spontaneity which we examined above, by taking the examples
      of Krichevsky and Martynov — and “restricted the sphere of his
      influence”, convinced, of course, as is Martynov, that “by doing
      so he deepened that influence” (63). In a word, you will see
      that de facto Martynov reduces Social-Democracy to the
      level of trade-unionism, though he does so, of course, not
      because he does not desire the good of Social-Democracy, but
      simply because he is a little too much in a hurry to render
      Plekhanov more profound, instead of taking the trouble to
      understand him.
  

      Let us return, however, to our theses. We said that a Social
      Democrat, if he really believes it necessary to develop
      comprehensively the political consciousness of the proletariat,
      must “go among all classes of the population”. This gives rise
      to the questions: how is this to be done? have we enough forces
      to do this? is there a basis for such work among all the other
      classes?  will this not mean a retreat, or lead to a retreat,

   

      from the class point of view? Let us deal with these questions.
  

      We must “go among all classes of the population” as
      theoreticians, as proagandists, as agitators, and as
      organisers. Noone doubts that the theoretical work of
      Social-Democrats should aim at studying all the specific
      features of the social and political condition of the various
      classes. But extremely little is done in this direction as
      compared with the work that is done in studying the specific
      features of factory life. In the committees and study circles,
      one can meet people who are immersed in the study even of some
      special branch of the metal industry; but one can hardly ever
      find members of organisations (obliged, as often happens, for
      some reason or other to give up practical work) who are
      especially engaged in gathering material on some pressing
      question of social and political life in our country which could
      serve as a means for conducting Social-Democratic work among
      other strata of the population. In dwelling upon the fact that
      the majority of the present-day leaders of the working-class
      movement lack training, we cannot refrain from mentioning
      training in this respect also, for it too is bound up with the
      Economist conception of “close organic connection with the
      proletarian struggle”. The principal thing, of course, is
      propaganda and agitation among all strata of
      the people. The work of the West European Social-Democrat is in
      this respect facilitated by the public meetings and rallies
      which all are free to attend, and by the fact that in
      parliament he addresses the representatives of all
  classes. We have neither a parliament nor freedom of
      assembly; nevertheless, we are able to arrange meetings of
      workers who desire to listen to a Social-Democrat. We
      must also find ways and means of calling meetings of
      representatives of all social classes that desire to listen to
      a democrat; for he is no Social-Democrat who forgets in
      practice that “the Communists support every revolutionary
      movement”, that we are obliged for that reason to expound and
      emphasise general democratic tasks before the whole
      people, without for a moment concealing our socialist
      convictions. He is no Social-Democrat who forgets in practice
      his obligation to be ahead of all in raising,
      accentuating, and solving every  general democratic
      question.
  


      “But everyone agrees with this!” the impatient reader will
      exclaim, and the new instructions adopted by the last conference
      of the Union Abroad for the Editorial Board of Rabocheye
      Dyelo definitely say: “All events of social and political
      life that affect the proletariat either directly as a special
      class or as the vanguard of all the revolutionary forces in
      the struggle for freedom should serve as subjects for
      political propaganda and agitation” (Two Conferences,
      p. 17, our italics). Yes, these are very true and very good
      words, and we would be fully satisfied if Rabocheye
      Dyelo understood them and if it refrained from saying
      in the next breath things that contradict them. For it is
      not enough to call ourselves the “vanguard”, the advanced
      contingent; we must act in such a way that all the other
      contingents recognise and are obliged to admit that we are
      marching in the vanguard. And we ask the reader: Are the
      representatives of the other “contingents” such fools as to take
      our word for it when we say that we are the “vanguard”? just
      picture to yourselves the following: a Social-Democrat comes to
      the “contingent” of Russian educated radicals, or liberal
      constitutionalists, and says, We are the vanguard; “the task
      confronting us now is, as far as possible, to lend the economic
      struggle itself a political character”. The radical, or
      constitutionalist, if he is at all intelligent (and there are
      many intelligent men among Russian radicals and
      constitutionalists), would only smile at such a speech and would
      say (to himself, of course, for in the majority of cases he is
      an experienced diplomat): “Your ’vanguard’ must be made up of
      simpletons. They do not even understand that it is our task, the
      task of the progressive representatives of bourgeois democracy
      to lend the workers’ economic struggle itself a
      political character. Why, we too, like the West-European
      bourgeois, want to draw the workers into politics, but only
      into trade-unionist, not into Social-Democratic politics.
      Trade-unionist politics of the working class is precisely
      bourgeois politics of the working class, and this
      ‘vanguard’s’ formulation of its task is the formulation of
      trade-unionist politics! Let them call themselves
      Social-Democrats to their heart’s content, I am not a child to
      get excited over a label. But they must not fall under the
      influence of those pernicious orthodox doctrinaires, let them
      allow ’freedom of criticism’ to those who unconsciously are

  

      driving Social-Democracy into trade-unionist channels.”
      

      And the faint  smile of our constitutionalist will turn into
      Homeric laughter when he learns that the Social-Democrats who
      talk of Social-Democracy as the vanguard, today, when
      spontaneity almost completely dominates our movement, fear
      nothing so much as “belittling the spontaneous element”, as
      “underestimating the significance of the forward movement of the
      drab everyday struggle, as compared with the propaganda of
      brilliant and completed ideas”, etc., etc.! A “vanguard” which
      fears that consciousness will outstrip spontaneity, which fears
      to put forward a bold “plan” that would compel general
      recognition even among those who differ with us. Are they not
      confusing “vanguard” with “rearguard”?
      

      Indeed, let us examine the following piece of reasoning by
      Martynov. On page 40 he says that Iskra is one-sided in
      its tactics of exposing abuses, that “however much we may spread
      distrust and hatred of the government, we shall not achieve our
      aim until we have succeeded in developing sufficient active
      social energy for its overthrow”. This, it may be said
      parenthetically, is the familiar solicitude for the activation
      of the masses, with a simultaneous striving to restrict one’s
      own activity. But that is not the main point at the
      moment. Martynov speaks here, accordingly, of revolutionary
  energy (“for overthrowing”). And what conclusion does he
      arrive at? Since in ordinary times various social strata
      inevitably march separately, “it is therefore, clear that we
      Social-Democrats cannot simultaneously guide the activities of
      various opposition strata, we cannot dictate to them a positive
      programme of action, we cannot point out to them in what manner
      they should wage a day-to-day struggle for their
      interests.... The liberal strata will themselves take care of
      the active struggle for their immediate interests, the struggle
      that will bring them face to face with our political regime”
      (p. 41). Thus, having begun with talk about revolutionary
      energy, about the active struggle for the overthrow of the
      autocracy, Martynov immediately turns toward trade union energy
      and active struggle for immediate interests! It goes without
      saying that we cannot guide the struggle of the students,
      liberals, etc., for their

   

  “immediate interests”; but this was
      not the point at issue, most worthy Economist! The point we were
      discussing was the possible and necessary participation of
      various social strata in the overthrow of the autocracy; and not
      only are we able, but it is our bounden duty, to guide
      these “activities of the various opposition strata”, if
      we desire to be the “vanguard”. Not only will our students and
      liberals, etc., themselves take care of “the struggle that
      brings them face to face with our political regime”; the police
      and the officials of the autocratic government will see to this
      first and foremost. But if “we” desire to be front-rank
      democrats, we must make it our concern to direct the
      thoughts of those who are dissatisfied only with conditions at
      the university, or in the Zemstvo, etc., to the idea that the
      entire political system is worthless. We must take upon
      ourselves the task of organising an all-round political struggle
      under the leadership of our Party in such a manner as to make it
      possible for all oppositional strata to render their fullest
      support to the struggle and to our Party. We must train
      our Social-Democratic practical workers to become political
      leaders, able to guide all the manifestations of this all-round
      struggle, able at the right time to “dictate a positive
      programme of action” for the aroused students, the discontented
      Zemstvo people, the incensed religious sects, the offended
      elementary schoolteachers, etc., etc. For that reason,
      Martynov’s assertion that “with regard to these, we can function
      merely in the negative role of exposers of abuses... we
      can only dissipate their hopes in various government
      commissions” is completely false (our italics). By
      saying this, Martynov shows that he absolutely fails to
      understand the role that the revolutionary “vanguard” must
      really play. If the reader bears this in mind, he will be clear
      as to the real meaning of Martynov’s concluding
      remarks: “Iskra is the organ of the revolutionary
      opposition which exposes the state of affairs in our country,
      particularly the political state of affairs, insofar as it
      affects the interests of the most varied strata of the
      population. We, however, work and will continue to work for the
      cause of the working class in close organic contact with the
      proletarian struggle. By restricting the sphere of our active
      influence we deepen that influence” (63). The true sense of this
      conclusion is as follows: Iskra desires to
  elevate the trade-unionist politics of the working class

   

  (to which, through misconception, through lack of training, or
      through conviction, our practical workers frequently confine
      themselves) to the level of Social-Democratic
      politics. Rabocheye Dyelo, however, desires to
      degrade Social-Democratic politics to trade-unionist
      politics. Moreover, it assures the world that the two positions
      are “entirely compatible within the common cause” (63). 
  0, sancta simplicitas!


      To proceed. Have we sufficient forces to direct our propaganda
      and agitation among all social classes? Most
      certainly. Our Economists, who are frequently inclined to deny
      this, lose sight of the gigantic progress our movement has made
      from (approximately) 1894 to 1901. Like real “tail-enders” they
      often go on living in the bygone stages of the movement’s
      inception. In the earlier period , indeed, we had astonishingly
      few forces, and it was perfectly natural and legitimate then to
      devote ourselves exclusively to activities among the workers and
      to condemn severely any deviation from this course. The entire
      task then was to consolidate our position in the working
      class. At the present time, however, gigantic forces have been
      attracted to the movement. The best representatives of the
      younger generation of the educated classes are coming over to
      us. Everywhere in the provinces there are people, resident there
      by dint of circumstance, who have taken part in the movement in
      the past or who desire to do so now and who, are gravitating
      towards Social-Democracy (whereas in 1894 one could count the
      Social-Democrats on the fingers of one’s hand). A basic
      political and organisational shortcoming of our movement is our
      inability to utilise all these forces and give them
      appropriate work (we shall deal with this more fully in the next
      chapter).  The overwhelming majority of these forces entirely
      lack the opportunity of “going among the workers”, so that there
      are no grounds for fearing that we shall divert forces from our
      main work. In order to be able to provide the workers with real,
      comprehensive, and live political knowledge, we must have “our
      own people”, Social-Democrats, everywhere, among all social
      strata, and in all positions from which we can learn the inner
      springs of our state mechanism. Such people are required, not
      only for propaganda and agitation, but in a still larger measure
      for organisation.
  


      Is there a basis for activity among all classes of the
      population? Whoever doubts this lags in his consciousness behind
      the spontaneous awakening of the masses. The working-class
      movement has aroused and is continuing to arouse discontent in
      some, hopes of support for the opposition in others, and in
      still others the realisation that the autocracy is unbearable
      and must inevitably fall. We would be “politicians” and
      Social-Democrats in name only (as all too often happens in
      reality), if we failed to realise that our task is to utilise
      every manifestation of discontent, and to gather and turn to the
      best account every protest, however small. This is quite apart
      from the fact that the millions of the labouring peasantry,
      handicraftsmen, petty artisans, etc., would always listen
      eagerly to the speech of any Social-Democrat who is at all
      qualified. Indeed, is there a single social class in which there
      are no individuals, groups, or circles that are discontented
      with the lack of rights and with tyranny and, therefore,
      accessible to the propaganda of Social-Democrats as the
      spokesmen of the most pressing general democratic needs? To
      those who desire to have a clear idea of what the political
      agitation of a Social-Democrat among all classes and
      strata of the population should be like, we would point to
      political exposures in the broad sense of the word as
      the principal (but, of course, not the sole) form of this
      agitation.
  


      “We must arouse in every section of the population that is at
      all politically conscious a passion for political
      exposure,” I wrote in my article “Where To Begin”
      [Iskra, May (No. 4), 1901], with which I shall deal in
      greater detail later. “We must not be discouraged by the fact
      that the voice of political exposure is today so feeble, timid,
      and infrequent. This is not because of a wholesale submission to
      police despotism, but because those who are able and ready to
      make exposures have no tribune from which to speak, no eager and
      encouraging audience, they do not see anywhere among the people
      that force to which it would be worth while directing their
      complaint against the ’omnipotent’ Russian Government.... We are
      now in a position to provide a tribune for the nation-wide
      exposure of the tsarist government, and it is our duty to do
      this. That tribune must be a Social-Democratic newspaper.”[16]



      The ideal audience for political exposure is the working class,
      which is first and foremost in need of all-round and live

   

      political knowledge, and is most capable of converting this
      knowledge into active struggle, even when that struggle does not
      promise “palpable results”. A tribune for nation-wide
      exposures can be only an all-Russia newspaper. “Without a
      political organ, a political movement deserving that name is
      inconceivable in the Europe of today”; in this respect Russia
      must undoubtedly be included in present-day Europe. The press
      long ago became a power in our country, otherwise the government
      would not spend tens of thousands of rubles to bribe it and to
      subsidise the Katkovs and Meshcherskys. And it is no novelty in
      autocratic Russia for the underground press to break through the
      wall of censorship and compel the legal and
      conservative press to speak openly of it. This was the case in
      the seventies and even in the fifties. How much broader and
      deeper are now the sections of the people willing to read the
      illegal underground press, and to learn from it “how to live and
      how to die”, to use the expression of a worker who sent a
      letter to Iskra (No. 7).[25] 
  Political exposures are as
      much a declaration of war against the government as
      economic exposures are a declaration of war against the factory
      owners. The moral significance of this declaration of war will
      be all the greater, the wider and more powerful the campaign of
      exposure will be and the more numerous and determined the social
      class that has declared war in order to begin the
      war. Hence, political exposures in themselves serve as a
      powerful instrument for disintegrating the system we
      oppose, as a means for diverting from the enemy his casual or
      temporary allies, as a means for spreading hostility and
      distrust among the permanent partners of the autocracy.
  

      In our time only a party that will organise really
      nation-wide exposures can become the vanguard of the
      revolutionary forces. The word “nation-wide” has a very profound
      meaning. The overwhelming majority of the non-working- class
      exposers (be it remembered that in order to become the vanguard,
      we must attract other classes) are sober politicians and
      level-headed men of affairs. They know perfectly well how
      dangerous it is to “complain” even against a minor official, let
      alone against the “omnipotent” Russian Government. And they will
      come to us with their complaints only when they see
      that these complaints can really have effect, and that we

   

      represent a political force. In order to become such a
      force in the eyes of outsiders, much persistent and stubborn
      work is required to raise our own consciousness,
      initiative, and energy.. To accomplish this it is not enough to
      attach a “vanguard” label to rearguard theory and practice.
  

      But if we have to undertake the organisation of a really
      nationwide exposure of the government, in what way will then the
      class character of our movement be expressed? — the overzealous
      advocate of “close organic contact with the proletarian
      struggle” will ask us, as indeed he does. The reply is manifold:
      we Social-Democrats will organise these nation-wide exposures;
      all questions raised by the agitation will he explained in a
      consistently Social-Democratic spirit, without any concessions
      to deliberate or undeliberate distortions of Marxism; the
      all-round political agitation will be conducted by a party which
      unites into one inseparable whole the assault on the government
      in the name of the entire people, the revolutionary training of
      the proletariat, and the safeguarding of its political
      independence, the guidance of the economic struggle of the
      working class, and the utilisation of all its spontaneous
      conflicts with its exploiters which rouse and bring into our
      camp increasing numbers of the proletariat.
  

      But a most characteristic feature of Economism is its failure to
      understand this connection, more, this identity of the most
      pressing need of the proletariat (a comprehensive political
      education through the medium of political agitation and
      political exposures) with the need of the general democratic
      movement. This lack of understanding is expressed, not only in
      “Martynovite” phrases, but in the references to a supposedly
      class point of view identical in meaning with these
      phrases. Thus, the authors of the Economist letter in
      Iskra, No. 12, state:[17]
[17]
   Lack of space has prevented us from replying in detail, in
  Iskra, to this letter, which is highly characteristic
      of the Economists. We were very glad at its appearance, for the
      allegations that Iskra did not maintain a consistent
      class point of view had reached us long before that from various
      sources, and we were waiting for an appropriate occasion, or for
      a formulated expression of this fashionable charge, to give our
      reply. Moreover, it is our habit to reply to attacks, not by
      defence, but by counter-attack.—Lenin


  “This basic drawback of
  
  
Iskra (overestimation of ideology) is also the cause of
      its inconsistency on the question of the attitude of
      Social-Democracy to the various social classes and
      tendencies. By theoretical reasoning (not by “the growth of
      Party tasks, which grow together with the Party”),
      Iskra solved the problem of the immediate transition to
      the struggle against absolutism. In all probability it senses
      the difficulty of such a task for the workers under the present
      state of affairs (not only senses, but knows full well that this
      task appears less difficult to the workers than to the Economist
      intellectuals with their nursemaid concern, for the workers are
      prepared to fight even for demands which, to use the language of
      the never-to-be-forgotten Martynov, do not “promise palpable
      results”) but lacking the patience to wait until the workers
      will have gathered sufficient forces for this struggle,
      Iskra begins to seek allies in the ranks of the
      liberals and intellectuals”. . . .
  

      Yes, we have indeed lost all “patience” “waiting” for the
      blessed time, long promised us by diverse “conciliators”, when
      the Economists will have stopped charging the workers with their
      own backwardness and justifying their own lack of energy with
      allegations that the workers lack strength. We ask our
      Economists: What do they mean by “the gathering of workingclass
      strength for the struggle”? Is it not evident that this means
      the political training of the workers, so that all the aspects
      of our vile autocracy are revealed to them? And is it not clear
      that precisely for this work we need “allies in the
      ranks of the liberals and intellectuals”, who are prepared to
      join us in the exposure of the political attack on the Zemstvos,
      on the teachers, on the statisticians, on the students, etc.? Is
      this surprisingly “intricate mechanism” really so difficult to
      understand? Has not P. B. Axelrod constantly repeated since 1897
      that “the task before the Russian Social-Democrats of acquiring
      adherents and direct and indirect allies among the
      non-proletarian classes will be solved principally and primarily
      by the character of the propagandist activities conducted among
      the proletariat itself”? But the Martynovs and the other
      Economists continue to imagine that “by economic struggle
      against the employers and the government” the workers must
      first gather strength (for trade-unionist politics) and
      then
   

  “go over” — we presume from trade-unionist
      “training for activity” to Social-Democratic activity!
  
  
      “...In this quest,” continue the Economists, “Iskra 
  not infrequently departs from the class point of view, obscures
      class antagonisms, and puts into the forefront the common nature
      of the discontent with the government, although the causes and
      the degree of the discontent vary considerably among the
      ’allies’. Such, for example, is Iskra’s attitude
      towards the Zemstvo . . .” Iskra, it is alleged,
      “promises the nobles that are dissatisfied with the government’s
      sops the assistance of the working class, but it does not say a
      word about the class antagonism that exists between these social
      strata.” If the reader will turn to the article “The Autocracy
      and the Zemstvo” (Iskra, Nos. 2 and 4), to which,
      in all probability, the authors of the letter refer, he
      will find that they[18] deal with the 
  attitude of the government towards the “mild agitation of the
      bureaucratic Zemstvo, which is based on the social-estates”, and
      towards the “independent activity of even the propertied
      classes”. The article states that the workers cannot look on
      indifferently while the government is waging a struggle against
      the Zemstvo, and the Zemstvos are called upon to stop making
      mild speeches and to speak firmly and resolutely when
      revolutionary Social-Democracy confronts the government in all
      its strength. What the authors of the letter do not agree with
      here is not clear. Do they think that the workers will “not
      understand” the phrases “propertied classes” and 
  “bureaucratic Zemstvo based on the social-estates”? Do they 
  think that urging the Zemstvo to abandon mild speeches and to
      speak firmly is  “overestimating ideology”? Do they imagine the
      workers can “gather strength” for the struggle against the
      autocracy if they know nothing about the attitude of the
      autocracy towards the Zemstvo as well? All this too
      remains unknown. One thing alone is clear and that is that the
      authors of the letter have a very vague idea of what the
      political tasks of Social-Democracy are. This is revealed still
      more clearly by their remark: “Such, too, is Iskra’s
      attitude towards the student movement” (i.e., it also “obscures
      the class antagonisms”).

   

  Instead of calling on the workers to
      declare by means of public demonstrations that the real
      breeding-place of unbridled violence, disorder, and outrage is
      not the university youth but the Russian Government
      (Iskra, No. 2[19])
  we ought probably to have inserted
      arguments in the spirit of Rabochaya Mysl! Such ideas
      were expressed by Social-Democrats in the autumn of 1901, after
      the events of February and March, on the eve of a fresh upsurge
      of the student movement, which reveals that even in this sphere
      the “spontaneous” protest against the autocracy is
      outstripping the conscious Social-Democratic leadership
      of the movement. The spontaneous striving of the workers to
      defend the students who are being assaulted by the police and
      the Cossacks surpasses the conscious activity of the
      Social-Democratic organisation!
  

      “And yet in other articles,” continue the authors of the letter,
      “Iskra sharply condemns all compromise and defends, for
      instance, the intolerant conduct of the Guesdists.” We would
      advise those who are wont so conceitedly and frivolously to
      declare that the present disagreements among the
      Social-Democrats are unessential and do not justify a split, to
      ponder these words. Is it possible for people to work together
      in the same organisation, when some among them contend that we
      have done extremely little to explain the hostility of the
      autocracy to the various classes and to inform the workers of
      the opposition displayed by the various social strata to the
      autocracy, while others among them see in this clarification a
      “compromise” — evidently a compromise with the theory of
      “economic struggle against the employers and the government”?
  

      We urged the necessity of carrying the class struggle into the
      rural districts in connection with the fortieth anniversary of
      the emancipation of the peasantry (issue No. 3[20] and spoke of the
      irreconcilability of the local government bodies and the
      autocracy in relation to Witte’s secret Memorandum (No. 4). In
      connection with the new law we attacked the feudal landlords and
      the government which serves them
  (No. 8[21])
  and we welcomed the illegal Zemstvo

   

  congress. We urged the Zemstvo to pass over from abject petitions
  (No. 8[22])
  to struggle. We encouraged the
      students, who had begun to understand the need for the political
      struggle, and to undertake this struggle (No. 3), while, at the
      same time, we lashed out at the “outrageous incomprehension”
      revealed by the adherents of the “purely student” movement, who
      called upon the students to abstain from participating in the
      street demonstrations (No. 3, in connection with the manifesto
      issued by the Executive Committee of the Moscow students on
      February 25). We exposed the “senseless dreams” and the “lying
      hypocrisy” of the cunning liberals of
  Rossiya[26] (No. 5),
      while pointing to the violent fury with which the
      government-gaoler persecuted “peaceful writers, aged professors,
      scientists, and well-known liberal Zemstvo members” (No. 5,
      “Police Raid on Literature”). We exposed the real significance
      of the programme of “state protection for the welfare of the
      workers” and welcomed the “valuable admission” that “it is
      better, by granting reforms from above, to forestall the demand
      for such reforms from below than to wait for those demands to be
      put forward” (No. 6[23]).
  We encouraged the protesting
      statisticians (No. 7) and censured the strike-breaking
      statisticians (No. 9). He who sees in these tactics an obscuring
      of the class-consciousness of the proletariat and a
      compromise with liberalism reveals his utter failure to
      understand the true significance of the programme of the
      Credo and carries out that programme de facto,
      however much he may repudiate it. For by such an
      approach he drags Social-Democracy towards the “economic
      struggle against the employers and the government” and
      yields to liberalism, abandons the task of actively
      intervening in every “liberal” issue and of determining his
      own, Social-Democratic, attitude towards this question.
  

F. Once More “Slanderers”, Once More 
  “Mystifiers”

      These polite expressions, as the reader will recall, belong to
      Rabocheye Dyelo, which in this way answers our charge
      that it “is indirectly preparing the ground for converting the

   

      working-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois
      democracy”. In its simplicity of heart Rabocheye Dyelo
      decided that this accusation was nothing more than a polemical
      sally: these malicious doctrinaires are bent on saying all sorts
      of unpleasant things about us, and, what can be more unpleasant
      than being an instrument of bourgeois democracy? And so they
      print in bold type a “refutation”: “Nothing but downright
      slander”, “mystification”, “mummery” 
  (Two Conferences, pp. 30, 31, 33). Like Jove, Rabocheye Dyelo 
  (although bearing little resemblance to that deity) is wrathful because it
      is wrong, and proves by its hasty abuse that it is incapable of
      understanding its opponents’ mode of reasoning. And yet, with
      only a little reflection it would have understood why any
  subservience to the spontaneity of the mass movement and
      any degrading of Social-Democratic politics to the
      level of trade-unionist politics mean preparing the ground for
      converting the working-class movement into an instrument of
      bourgeois democracy. The spontaneous working-class movement is
      by itself able to create (and inevitably does create) only
      trade-unionism, and working-class trade-unionist politics is
      precisely working-class bourgeois politics. The fact that the
      working class participates in the political struggle, and even
      in the political revolution, does not in itself make its
      politics Social-Democratic politics. Will Rabocheye
      Dyelo make bold to deny this? Will it, at long last,
      publicly, plainly, and without equivocation explain how it
      understands the urgent questions of international and of Russian
      Social-Democracy? Hardly. It will never do anything of the kind,
      because it holds fast to the trick, which might be described as
      the “not here” method — “It’s not me, 
  it’s not my horse, I’m
      not the driver. We are not Economists; Rabochaya Mysl
      does not stand for E’conomism; there is no Economism at all in
      Russia.” This is a remarkably adroit and “political” trick,
      which suffers from the slight defect, however, that the
      publications practising it are usually nicknamed, “At your
      service, sir”.
  

Rabocheye Dyelo imagines that bourgeois democracy in
      Russia is, in general, merely a “phantom” (Two
      Conferences, p. 32).[24]
[24] 
      There follows a reference to the “concrete Russian conditions
      which fatalistically impel the working-class movement on to the
      revolutionary

 

  path”. But these people refuse to understand that
      the revolutionary path of the working-class movement might not
      be a Social-Democratic path. When absolutism reigned, the entire
      West-European bourgeoisie “impelled”, deliberately impelled, the
      workers on to the path of revolution. We Social-Democrats,
      however, cannot be satisfied with that. And if we, by any means
      whatever, degrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of
      spontaneous trade-unionist politics, we thereby play into the
      hands of bourgeois democracy.—Lenin


      Happy people! Ostrich-like, they bury their heads

   

  in the sand and imagine that everything around
      has disappeared. Liberal publicists who month after month
      proclaim to the world their triumph over the collapse and even
      the disappearance of Marxism; liberal newspapers (S. Peterburgskiye
  Vedomosti,[27] Russkiye Vedomosti, 
  and many others) which encourage the liberals who bring to the
      workers the Brentano[28] conception of 
  the class struggle and the trade-unionist conception of politics; the 
  galaxy of critics of Marxism, whose real tendencies were so very well 
  disclosed by the Credo and whose literary products alone circulate
      in Russia without let or hindrance; the revival of revolutionary
      non-Social-Democratic tendencies, particularly after
      the February and March events — all these, apparently, are just
      phantoms! All these have nothing at all to do with bourgeois
      democracy!
  

Rabocheye Dyelo and the authors of the Economist letter
      published in Iskra, No. 12, should “ponder over the
      reason why the events of the spring brought about such a revival
      of revolutionary non-Social-Democratic tendencies instead of
      increasing the authority and the prestige of Social-Democracy”.
  

    The reason lies in the fact that we failed to cope with our
      tasks. The masses of the workers proved to be more active than
      we. We lacked adequately trained revolutionary leaders and
      organisers possessed of a thorough knowledge of the mood
      prevailing among all the opposition strata and able to head the
      movement, to turn a spontaneous demonstration into a political
      one, broaden its political character, etc. Under such
      circumstances, our backwardness will inevitably be utilised by the
      more mobile and more energetic non-Social-Democratic
      revolutionaries, and the workers, however energetically and
      self-sacrificingly they may fight the police and the troops,
      however revolutionary their actions may be, will prove to be
      merely a force supporting

   

    those revolutionaries, the rearguard of
      bourgeois democracy, and not the Social-Democratic vanguard. Let
      us take, for example, the German Social-Democrats, whose weak
      aspects alone our Economists desire to emulate. Why is there
      not a single political event in Germany that does not add
      to the authority and prestige  of Social-Democracy? Because
      Social-Democracy is always found to be in advance of all others in
      furnishing the most revolutionary appraisal of every given event
      and in championing every protest against tyranny. It does not lull
      itself with arguments that the economic struggle brings the
      workers to realise that they have no political rights and that the
      concrete conditions unavoidably impel the working-class movement
      on to the path of revolution. It intervenes in every sphere and in
      every question of social and political life; in the matter of
      Wilhelm’s refusal to endorse a bourgeois progressist as city mayor
      (our Economists have not yet managed to educate. the Germans to
      the understanding that such an act is, in fact, a compromise with
      liberalism!); in the matter of the law against “obscene”
      publications and pictures; in the matter of governmental influence
      on the election of professors, etc., etc. Everywhere the
      Social-Democrats are found in the forefront, rousing political
      discontent among all classes, rousing the sluggards, stimulating
      the laggards, and providing a wealth of material for the
      development of the political consciousness and the political
      activity of the proletariat. As a result, even the avowed enemies
      of socialism are filled with respect for this advanced political
      fighter, and not infrequently an important document from
      bourgeois, and even from bureaucratic and Court circles, makes its
      way by some miraculous means into the editorial office of
      Vorwarts.


  This, then, is the resolution of the seeming “contradiction”
      that surpasses Rabocheye Dyelo’s powers of understanding
      to such an extent that it can only throw up its hands and cry,
      “Mummery!” Indeed, just think of it: We, Rabocheye Dyelo,
  regard the mass working-class movement as the
      corner-stone (and say so in bold type!); we warn all and
      sundry against belittling the significance of the element of
      spontaneity; we desire to lend the economic struggle itself —
      itself — a political character; we desire to maintain
      close and organic contact
  
     
  
    with the proletarian struggle. And yet
      we are told that we are preparing the ground for the conversion of
      the working-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois
      democracy! And who are they that presume to say this? People who
      “compromise” with liberalism by intervening in every “liberal”
      issue (what a gross misunderstanding of “organic contact with the
      proletarian struggle”!), by devoting so much attention to the
      students and even (oh horror!) to the Zemstvos! People who in
      general wish to devote a greater percentage (compared with the
      Economists) of their efforts to activity among non-proletarian
      classes of the population! What is this but “mummery”?
    

  Poor Rabocheye Dyelo! Will it ever find the solution
      to this perplexing puzzle?

[2]In the
      present chapter we deal only with the political struggle, in its
      broader or narrower meaning. Therefore, we note only in passing,
      merely as a curiosity, Rabocheye Dyelo’s charge that
      Iskra is “too restrained” in regard to the economic
      struggle (Two Conferences, p. 27, rehashed by Martynov
      in his pamphlet, Social-Democracy and the Working
      Class). If the accusers computed by the hundredweights or
      reams (as they are so fond of doing) any given year’s discussion
      of the economic struggle in the industrial section of
      Iskra, in comparison with the corresponding sections of
      Rabocheye Dyelo and Rabochaya Mysl combined,
      they would easily see that the latter lag behind even in this
      respect. Apparently, the realisation of this simple truth
      compels them to resort to arguments that clearly reveal their
      confusion. “Iskra,” they write, “willy-nilly [!] is
      compelled [!] to reckon with the imperative demands of life and
      to publish at least [!!] correspondence about the working-class
      movement” (Two Conferences, p. 27). Now this is really
      a crushing argument!—Lenin

[3]
   We say “in general”, because Rabocheye Dyelo speaks 
  of general principles and of the general tasks of the Party as a
      whole. Undoubtedly, cases occur in practice when politics really
      must follow economics, but only Economists can speak of
      this in a resolution intended to apply to the whole of
      Russia. Cases do occur when it is possible “right from
      the beginning” to carry on political agitation “exclusively on
      an economic basis”; yet Rabocheye Dyelo came in the end

  

  to the conclusion that “there is no need for this whatever”
      (Two Conferences, p. 11). In the following chapter, we
      shall show that the tactics of the “politicians” and
      revolutionaries not only do not ignore the trade union tasks of
      Social-Democracy, but that, on the contrary, they alone can
      secure their consistent fulfilment.—Lenin

Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, p. 60. This is the Martynov
      variation of the application, which we have characterised above,
      of the thesis “every step of real movement is more important
      than a dozen programmes” to the present chaotic state of our
      movement. In fact, this is merely a translation into Russian of
      the notorious Bernsteinian sentence: “The movement is
      everything, the final aim is nothing.”—Lenin

[12] To
      prove that this imaginary speech of a worker to an Economist is
      based on fact, we shall refer to two witnesses who undoubtedly
      have direct knowledge of the working-class movement and who are
      least of all inclined to be partial towards us “doctrinaires”;
      for one witness is an Economist (who regards even Rabocheye
      Dyelo as a political organ!), and the other is a
      terrorist. The first witness is the author of a remarkably
      truthful and vivid article entitled “The St. Petersburg
      Working-Class Movement and the Practical Tasks of
      Social-Democracy”, published in Rabocheye Dyelo
      No. 6. He divides the workers into the following categories: (1)
      class-conscious revolutionaries; (2) intermediate stratum; (3)
      the remaining masses. The intermediate stratum, he says, “is
      often more interested in questions of political life than in its
      own immediate economic interests, the connection between which

   

      and the general social conditions it has long understood” ...
      Rabochaya Mysl “is sharply criticised”: “It keeps on
      repeating the same thing over and over again, things we have
      long known, read long ago.” “Again nothing in the political
      review!” (pp. 30-31). But even the third stratum, “the younger
      and more sensitive section of the workers, less corrupted by the
      tavern and the church, who hardly ever have the opportunity of
      getting hold of political literature, discuss political events
      in a rambling way and ponder over the fragmentary news they get
      about student riots”, etc. The terrorist writes as follows: They
      read over once or twice the petty details of factory life in
      other towns, not their own, and then they read no more ... dull,
      they find it.... To say nothing in a workers’ paper about the
      government ...  is to regard the workers as being little
      children.... The workers are not little children"
      (Svoboda, published by the Revolutionary-Socialist
      Group,.  pp. 69-70).—Lenin

[13] 
      Martynov “conceives of another, more realistic [?] dilemma”
      (Social-Democracy and the Working Class, p. 19):
      “Either Social-Democracy takes over the direct leadership of the
      economic struggle of the proletariat and by that [!] transforms
      it into a revolutionary class struggle....” “By that”, i.e.,
      apparently by the direct leadership of the economic
      struggle. Can Martynov cite an instance in which leading the
      trade-union struggle alone has succeeded in transforming a
      trade-unionist movement into a revolutionary class movement? Can
      he not understand that in order to bring about this
      “transformation” we must actively take up the “direct
      leadership” of all-sided political agitation?... “Or the other
      perspective: Social-Democracy refrains from assuming the
      leadership of the economic struggle of the workers and so
      ... clips  its own wings ... ” In Rabocheye Dyelo’s
      opinion, quoted above, it is Iskra  that “refrains”. We
      have seen, however, that the latter does far more than
      Rabocheye Dyelo to lead the economic struggle, but that,
      moreover, it does not confine itself thereto and does not
      narrow down its political tasks for its sake.—Lenin

      The letter in Iskra, No. 7 (August 1901), was from a
      weaver. It was published in the section “Workers’ Movement and Letters
      from the Factories”. The letter testified to the great influence of
      Lenin’s Iskra among the advanced workers.

      The letter reads in part:

      “...I showed Iskra to many fellow-workers and the copy was
      read to tatters; but we treasure it.... Iskra writes about our
      cause, about the All-Russian cause which cannot be evaluated in kopeks or
      measured in hours; when you read the paper you understand why the gendarmes
      and the police are afraid of us workers and of the intellectuals whom we
      follow. It is a fact that they are a threat, not only to the bosses’
      pockets, but to the tsar, the employers, and all the rest.... It will not
      take much now to set the working people aflame. All that is wanted is a
      spark, and the fire will break out. How true are the words ‘The Spark will
      kindle a flame!’ (The motto of Iskra.—Ed.) 
  In the past every strike was an important
      
        
      
      event, but today everyone sees that strikes alone are not enough and that
      we must now fight for freedom, gain it through struggle. Today everyone,
      old and young, is eager to read but the sad thing is that there are no
      books. Last Sunday I gathered eleven people and read to them ‘Where To
      Begin’. We discussed it until late in the evening. How well it expressed
      everything, how it gets to the very heart of things.... And we would like
      to write a letter to your Iskra and ask you to teach us, not only
      how to begin, but how to live and how to die.”

      achieving social equality within the framework of capitalism by reforms and
      through the reconciliation of the interests of the capitalists and of the
      workers. Using Marxist phraseology as a cover, Brentano and his followers
      tried to subordinate the working-class movement to the interests of the
      bourgeoisie.

IV
The Primitiveness of the Economists
      and the Organization of the Revolutionaries
  

Rabocheye Dyelo’s assertions, which we have analyzed,
      that the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means
      of political agitation and that our task now is to lend the
      economic struggle itself a political character, etc., express a
      narrow view, not only of our political, but also of our
      organizational tasks.  The “economic struggle against the
      employers and the government” does not at all require an
      all-Russia centralized organization, and hence this struggle can
      never give rise to such an organization as will combine, in one
      general assault, all the manifestations of political opposition,
      protest, and indignation, an organization that will consist of
      professional revolutionaries and be led by the real political
      leaders of the entire people.  This stands to reason.  The
      character of any organization is naturally and inevitably
      determined by the content of its activity.  Consequently,
      Rabocheye Dyelo, by the assertions analyzed above,
      sanctifies and legitimizes not only narrowness of political
      activity, but also of organizational work.  In this case,
      Rabocheye Dyelo, as always, proves itself an organ
      whose consciousness yields to spontaneity.  Yet subservience to
      spontaneously developing forms of organisation, failure to

  

      realise the narrowness and primitiveness of our organisational
      work, of our “handicraft” methods in this most important sphere,
      failure to realise this, I say, is a veritable ailment from
      which our movement suffers. It is not an ailment that comes with
      decline, but one, of course, that comes with growth. It is
      however at the present time, when the wave of spontaneous
      indignation, as it were, is sweeping over us, leaders and
      organisers of the movement, that an irreconcilable struggle must
      be waged against all defence of backwardness, against any
      legitimation of narrowness in this matter. It is particularly
      necessary to arouse in all who participate in practical work, or
      are preparing to take up that work, discontent with the
      amateurism prevailing among us and an unshakable
      determination to rid ourselves of it.


A. WHAT IS PRIMITIVENESS?

      We shall try to answer this question by giving a brief
      description of the activity of a typical Social-Democratic study
      circle of the period 1894-1901. We have noted that the entire
      student youth of the period was absorbed in Marxism. Of course,
      these students were not only, or even not so much, interested in
      Marxism as a theory; they were interested in it as an answer to
      the question, “What is to be done?”, as a call to take the field
      against the enemy. These new warriors marched to battle with
      astonishingly primitive equipment and training. In a vast number
      of cases they had almost no equipment and absolutely no
      training. They marched to war like peasants from the plough,
      armed only with clubs. A students’ circle establishes contacts
      with workers and sets to work, without any connection with the
      old members of the movement, without any connection with study
      circles in other districts, or even in other parts of the same
      city (or in other educational institutions), without any
      organisation of the various divisions of revolutionary work,
      without any systematic plan of activity covering any length of
      time. The circle gradually expands its propaganda and agitation;
      by its activities it wins the sympathies of fairly large
      sections of workers and of a certain section of the educated
      strata, which provide it with money and from among whom the

  

      “committee” recruits new groups of young people. The attractive
      power of the committee (or League of Struggle) grows, its sphere
      of activity becomes wider, and the committee expands this
      activity quite spontaneously; the very people who a year or a
      few months previously spoke at the students’ circle gatherings
      and discussed the question, “Whither?”, who established and
      maintained contacts with the workers and wrote and published
      leaflets, now, establish contacts with other groups of
      revolutionaries, procure literature, set to work to publish a
      local newspaper, begin to talk of organising a demonstration,
      and finally turn to open warfare (which may, according to
      circumstances, take the form of issuing the first agitational
      leaflet or the first issue of a newspaper, or of organising the
      first demonstration). Usually the initiation of such actions
      ends in an immediate and complete fiasco. Immediate and
      complete, because this open warfare was not the result of a
      systematic and carefully thought-out and gradually prepared plan
      for a prolonged and stubborn struggle, but simply the result of
      the spontaneous growth of traditional study circle work;
      because, naturally, the police, in almost every case, knew the
      principal leaders of the local movement, since they had already
      “gained a reputation” for themselves in their student days, and
      the police waited only for the right moment to make their
      raid. They deliberately allowed the study circle sufficient time
      to develop its work so that they might, obtain a palpable
      corpus delicti, and they always permitted several of
      the persons known to them to remain at liberty “for breeding”
      (which, as far as I know, is the technical term used both by our
      people and by the gendarmes). One cannot help comparing this
      kind of warfare with that conducted by a mass of peasants, armed
      with clubs, against modern troops. And one can only wonder at
      the vitality of the movement which expanded, grew, and scored
      victories despite the total lack of training on the part of the
      fighters. True, from the historical point of view, the
      primitiveness of equipment was not only inevitable at first, but
      even legitimate as one of the conditions for the wide
      recruiting of fighters, but as soon as serious war operations
      began (and they began in fact with the strikes in the summer of
      1896), the defects in our fighting organisations made themselves
      felt to an ever-increasing

  

  degree. The government, at first
      thrown into confusion and committing a number of blunders (e.g.,
      its appeal to the public describing the misdeeds of the
      socialists, or the banishment of workers from the capitals to
      provincial industrial centres), very soon adapted itself to the
      new conditions of the struggle and managed to deploy well its
      perfectly equipped detachments of agents provocateurs,
      spies, and gendarmes. Raids became so frequent, affected such a
      vast number of people, and cleared out the local study circles
      so thoroughly that the masses of the workers lost literally all
      their leaders, the movement assumed an amazingly sporadic
      character, and it became utterly impossible to establish
      continuity and coherence in the work. The terrible dispersion of
      the local leaders; the fortuitous character of the study circle
      memberships; the lack of training in, and the narrow outlook on,
      theoretical, political, and organisational questions were all
      the inevitable result of the conditions described above. Things
      have reached such a pass that in several places the workers,
      because of our lack of self-restraint and the inability to
      maintain secrecy, begin to lose faith in the intellectuals and
      to avoid them; the intellectuals, they say, are much too
      careless and cause police raids!


      Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the movement is aware
      that all thinking Social-Democrats have at last begun to regard
      these amateurish methods as a disease. In order that the reader
      who is not acquainted with the movement may have no grounds for
      thinking that we are “inventing” a special stage or special
      disease of the movement, we shall refer once again to the
      witness we have quoted. We trust we shall be forgiven for the
      length of the passage:



      “While the gradual transition to more extensive practical
      activity,” writes B-v in Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 6, 
  “a transition that is directly dependent on the general
      transitional period through which the Russian working-class
      movement is now passing, is a characteristic feature,
      . . . there is, however, another, no less interesting feature in
      the general mechanism of the Russian workers’ revolution. We
      refer to the general lack of revolutionary forces fit for
      action, [all italics ours — Lenin] which is felt not only
      in St. Petersburg, but throughout Russia. With the general
      revival of the working-class movement, with the general
      development of the working masses, with the growing frequency of
      strikes, with the increasingly open mass struggle of the workers,

  

      and with the intensified government persecution, arrests,
      deportation, and exile, this lack of highly skilled
      revolutionary forces is becoming more and more marked and,
      without a doubt, cannot but affect the depth and the general
      character of the movement. Many strikes take place without
      any strong and direct influence upon them by the revolutionary
      organisations.... A shortage of agitational leaflets and illegal
      literature Is felt.... The workers’ study circles are left
      without agitators.... In addition, there is a constant dearth of
      funds. In a word, the growth of the working class movement
      is outstripping the growth and development of the revolutionary
      organisations. The numerical strength of the active
      revolutionaries is too small to enable them to concentrate in
      their own hands the influence exercised upon the whole mass of
      discontented workers, or to give this discontent even a shadow
      of coherence and organisation.... The separate study circles,
      the separate revolutionaries, scattered, uncombined, do not
      represent a single, strong, and disciplined organisation with
      proportionately developed parts. . . .” Admitting that the
      immediate organization of fresh study circles to replace those
      that have been broken up merely proves the vitality of the
      movement ... but does not prove the existence of an adequate
      number of adequately prepared revolutionary workers, the author
      concludes: “The lack of practical training among the
      St. Petershurg revolutionaries is seen in the results of their
      work. The recent trials, especially that of the
      Self-Emancipation Group and the Labour-against-Capital
  group,[19]
      clearly showed that the young agitator, lacking a detailed
      knowledge of working class conditions and, consequently, of the
      conditions under which agitation can be carried on in a given
      factory, ignorant of the principles of secrecy, and
      understanding only the general principles of Social-Democracy
      [if he does], is able to carry on his work for perhaps four,
      five, or six months. Then come arrests, which frequently lead to
      the break-up of the entire organisation, or at all events, of
      part of it. The question arises, therefore, can the group
      conduct successful activity if its existence is measured by
      months?... Obviously, the defects of the existing organisations
      cannot be wholly ascribed to the transitional
      period.... Obviously, the numerical, and above all the
      qualitative, make-up of the functioning organisations is no
      small factor, and the first task our Social-Democrats must
      undertake ... is that of effectively combining the
      organisations and making a strict selection of their
      membership.”



B. Primitiveness and Economism

      We must now deal with a question that has undoubtedly come to
      the mind of every reader. Can a connection be established
      between primitiveness as growing pains that affect the whole
      movement, and Economism, which is one of the
      currents in Russian Social-Democracy? We think that it can. Lack
      of practical training, of ability to carry on organisational
      work is certainly common to us all, including those who

  

      have from the very outset unswervingly stood for revolutionary
      Marxism. Of course, were it only lack of practical training, no
      one could blame the practical workers. But the term
      “primitiveness” embraces something more than lack of training;
      it denotes a narrow scope of revolutionary work generally,
      failure to understand that a good organisation of
      revolutionaries cannot be built on the basis of such narrow
      activity, and lastly — and this is the main thing — attempts
      to justify this narrowness and to elevate it to a special
      “theory”, i.e., subservience to spontaneity on this question
      too. Once such attempts were revealed, it became clear that
      primitiveness is connected with Economism and that we shall
      never rid ourselves of this narrowness of our organisational
      activity until we rid ourselves of Economism generally (i.e.,
      the narrow conception of Marxist theory, as well as of the role
      of Social-Democracy and of its political tasks). These attempts
      manifested themselves in a twofold direction. Some began to say
      that the working masses themselves have not yet advanced the
      broad and militant political tasks which the revolutionaries are
      attempting to “impose” on them; that they must continue to
      struggle for immediate political demands, to conduct
      “the economic struggle against the employers and the
  government”[1] (and,
      naturally, corresponding to this struggle which is “accessible”
      to the mass movement there must be an organisation that will be
      “accessible” to the most untrained youth). Others, far removed
      from any theory of  “gradualness”, said that it is possible and
      necessary to “bring about a political revolution”, but that this
      does not require building a strong organisation of
      revolutionaries to train the proletariat in steadfast and
      stubborn struggle. All we need do is to snatch up our old
      friend, the “accessible” cudgel. To drop metaphor, it means that
      we must organise a general strike,[2]
  or that we must stimulate the
      “spiritless” progress of the working-class movement by means of
      “excitative terror”.[3]
  

  Both these trends, the opportunists
      and the “revolutionists”, bow to the prevailing amateurism;
      neither believes that it can be eliminated, neither understands
      our primary and imperative practical task to establish an
      organisation of revolutionaries capable of lending energy,
      stability, and continuity to the political struggle.


      We have quoted the words of B-v: “The growth of the
      working-class movement is outstripping the growth and
      development of the revolutionary organisations.” This “valuable
      remark of a close observer” (Rabocheye Dyelo’s comment
      on B-v’s article) has a twofold value for us. It shows that we
      were right in our opinion that the principal cause of the
      present crisis in Russian Social-Democracy is the lag of the
      leaders (“ideologists”, revolutionaries, Social-Democrats)
      behind the spontaneous upsurge of the masses. It shows
      that all the arguments advanced by the authors of the Economist
      letter (in Iskra, No. 12), by Krichevsky and by
      Martynov, as to the danger of belittling the significance of the
      spontaneous element, of the drab everyday struggle, as to
      tactics-as-process, etc., are nothing more than a glorification
      and a defence of primitiveness. These people who cannot
      pronounce the word “theoretician” without a sneer, who describe
      their genuflections to common lack of training and backwardness
      as a “sense for the realities of life”, reveal in practice a
      failure to understand our most imperative practical
      tasks. To laggards they shout: Keep in step! Don’t run ahead! To
      people suffering from a lack of energy and initiative in
      organisational work, from a lack of “plans” for wide and bold
      activity, they prate about “tactics-as-process”! The worst sin
      we commit is that we degrade our political and
      organisational tasks to the level of the immediate,
      “palpable”,  “concrete” interests of the everyday economic
      struggle; yet they keep singing to us the same refrain: Lend the
      economic struggle itself a political character! We repeat: this
      kind of thing displays as much “sense for the realities of life”
      as was displayed by the hero in the popular fable who cried out
      to a passing funeral procession, “Many happy returns of the
      day!”


      Recall the matchless, truly “Narcissus-like” superciliousness
      with which these wiseacres lectured Plekhanov on the “workers’
      circles generally” (sic!) being “unable to cope with

  

      political tasks in the real and practical sense of the
      word, i.e., in the sense of the expedient and successful
      practical struggle for political demands”
      (Rabocheye Dyelo’s Reply, p. 24). There are circles and
      circles, gentlemen! Circles of “amateurs” are not, of course,
      capable of coping with political tasks so long as they have not
      become aware of their amateurism and do not abandon it. If,
      besides this, these amateurs are enamoured of their primitive
      methods, and insist on writing the word “practical” in italics,
      and imagine that being practical demands that one’s tasks be
      reduced to the level of understanding of the most backward
      strata of the masses, then they are hopeless amateurs and, of
      course, certainly cannot in general cope with any political
      tasks. But a circle of leaders, of the type of Alexeyev and
      Myshkin, of Khalturin and Zhelyabov, is capable of coping with
      political tasks in the genuine and most practical sense of the
      term, for the reason and to the extent that their impassioned
      propaganda meets with response among the spontaneously awakening
      masses, and their sparkling energy is answered and supported by
      the energy of the revolutionary class. Plekhanov was profoundly
      right, not only in pointing to this revolutionary class and
      proving that its spontaneous awakening was inevitable, but in
      setting even the “workers’ circles” a great and lofty political
      task. But you refer to the mass movement that has sprung up
      since that time in order to degrade this task, to
      curtail the energy and scope of activity of the
      “workers’ circles”. If you are not amateurs enamoured of your
      primitive methods, what are you then? You boast that you are
      practical, but you fail to see what every Russian practical
      worker knows, namely, the miracles that the energy, not only of
      a circle, but even of an individual person is able to perform in
      the revolutionary cause. Or do you think that our movement
      cannot produce leaders like those of the seventies? If so, why
      do you think so? Because we lack training? But we are training
      ourselves, we will go on training ourselves, and we will be
      trained! Unfortunately it is true that the surface of the
      stagnant waters of the “economic struggle against the employers
      and the government” is overgrown with fungus; people have
      appeared among us who kneel in prayer to spontaneity, gazing
      with awe (to take an expression from Plekhanov) upon the

  

      “posterior” of the Russian proletariat. But we will get rid of
      this fungus. The time has come when Russian revolutionaries,
      guided by a genuinely revolutionary theory, relying upon the
      genuinely revolutionary and spontaneously awakening class, can
      at last — at long last! — rise to full stature in all their
      giant strength. All that is required is for the masses of our
      practical workers, and the still larger masses of those who
      dreamed of practical work when they were still at school, to
      pour scorn and ridicule upon any suggestion that may be made to
      degrade our political tasks and to restrict the scope of our
      organisational work. And we will achieve that, rest assured,
      gentlemen!


      In the article “Where To Begin”, I wrote in opposition to
      Rabocheye Dyelo: “The tactics of agitation in relation
      to some special question, or the tactics with regard to some
      detail of party organisation may be changed in twenty-four
      hours; but only people devoid of all principle are capable of
      changing, in twenty-four hours, or, for that matter, in
      twenty-four months, their view on the necessity — in general,
      constantly, and absolutely — of an organisation of struggle and
      of political agitation among the masses.”[4] To this
      Rabocheye Dyelo replied: “This, the only one of
      Iskra’s charges that makes a pretence of being based on
      facts, is totally without foundation. Readers of Rabocheye
      Dyelo know very well that from the outset we not only
      called for political agitation, without waiting for the
      appearance of Iskra ... [saying at the same time that
      not only the workers’ study circles, “but also the mass
      working-class movement could not regard as its first political
      task the overthrow of absolutism”, but only the struggle for
      immediate political demands, and that “the masses begin to
      understand immediate political demands after one, or at all
      events, after several strikes”], . . . but that with our
      publications which we furnished from abroad for the comrades
      working in Russia, we provided the only
      Social-Democratic political and agitational material ... [and in
      this sole material you not only based the widest political
      agitation exclusively on the economic struggle, but you even
      went to the extent of claiming that this restricted agitation
      was the “most widely

  

  applicable”. And do you not observe,
      gentlemen, that your own argument — that this was the
      only material provided — proves the necessity for
      Iskra’s appearance, and its struggle against
      Rabocheye Dyelo?].... On the other hand, our publishing
      activity actually prepared the ground for the tactical unity of
      the Party... [unity in the conviction that tactics is a process
      of growth of Party tasks that grow together with the Party? A
      precious unity indeed!]... and by that rendered possible the
      creation of a ’militant organisation’ for which the Union Abroad
      did all that an organisation abroad could do” (Rabocheye
      Dyelo, No. 10, p. 15). A vain attempt at evasion! I would
      never dream of denying that you did all you possibly could. I
      have asserted and assert now that the limits of what is
      “possible” for you to do are restricted by the narrowness of
      your outlook. It is ridiculous to talk of a “militant
      organisation” to fight for “immediate political demands”, or to
      conduct the economic struggle against the employers and the
      government”.


      But if the reader wishes to see the pearls of “Economist”
      infatuation with amateurism, he must, of course, turn from the
      eclectic and vacillating Rabocheye Dyelo to the
      consistent and determined Rabochaya Mysl. In its
      Separate Supplement, p. 13, R. M. wrote: “Now two words
      about the so-called revolutionary intelligentsia proper. True,
      on more than one occasion it has proved itself prepared ’to
      enter into determined battle with tsarism’. The unfortunate
      thing, however, is that our revolutionary intelligentsia,
      ruthlessly persecuted by the political police, imagined the
      struggle against the political police to be the political
      struggle against the autocracy. That is why, to this day, it
      cannot understand ’where the forces for the struggle against the
      autocracy are to be obtained’.”


      Truly matchless is the lofty contempt for the struggle against
      the police displayed by this worshipper (in the worst sense of
      the word) of the spontaneous movement! He is prepared
      to justify our inability to organise secret activity by
      the argument that with the spontaneous mass movement it is not
      at all important for us to struggle against the political
      police! Very few people indeed would subscribe to this appalling
      conclusion; to such an extent have our deficiencies in
      revolutionary organisations become a matter of acute

  

  importance. But if Martynov, for example, refuses to subscribe
      to this, it will only be because he is unable, or lacks the
      courage, to think out his ideas to their logical
      conclusion. Indeed, does the “task” of advancing concrete
      demands by the masses, demands that promise palpable results,
      call for special efforts to create a stable, centralised,
      militant organisation of revolutionaries? Cannot such a “task”
      be carried out even by masses that do not “struggle against the
      political police” at all? Could this task, moreover, be
      fulfilled if, in addition to the few leaders, it were not
      undertaken by such workers (the overwhelming majority) as are
      quite incapable of “struggling against the political
      police”? Such workers, average people of the masses, are capable
      of displaying enormous energy and selfsacrifice in strikes and
      in street, battles with the police and the troops, and are
      capable (in fact, are alone capable) of determining the
      outcome of our entire movement — but the struggle against the
      political police requires special qualities; it
      requires professional revolutionaries. And we must see
      to it, not only that the masses “advance” concrete demands, but
      that the masses of the workers “advance” an increasing number of
      such professional revolutionaries. Thus, we have reached the
      question of the relation between an organisation of professional
      revolutionaries and the labour movement pure and
      simple. Although this question has found little reflection in
      literature, it has greatly engaged us “politicians” in
      conversations and polemics with comrades who gravitate more or
      less towards Economism. It is a question meriting special
      treatment. But before taking it up, let us offer one further
      quotation by way of illustrating our thesis on the connection
      between primitiveness and Economism.


      In his Reply, Mr. N. N.[20] 
  wrote: “The Emancipation of
      Labour group demands direct struggle against the government
      without first considering where the material forces for this
      struggle are to be obtained, and without indicating the path
      of the struggle.” Emphasising the last words, the author
      adds the following footnote to the word “Path”: “This cannot be
      explained by purposes of secrecy, because the programme does not
      refer to a plot but to a mass movement. And the masses
      cannot proceed by secret paths. Can we conceive of a secret
      strike? Can we conceive of secret demonstrations and petitions?”

  

      (Vademecum, p. 59.) Thus, the author comes quite close
      to the question of the “material forces” (organisers of strikes
      and demonstrations) and to the “paths” of the struggle, but,
      nevertheless, is still in a state of consternation, because he
      “worships” the mass movement, i.e., he regards it as something
      that relieves us of the necessity of conducting
      revolutionary activity and not as something that should
      encourage us and stimulate our revolutionary
      activity. It is impossible for a strike to remain a secret to
      those participating in it and to those immediately associated
      with it, but it may (and in the majority of cases does) remain a
      “secret” to the masses of the Russian workers, because the
      government takes care to cut all communication with the
      strikers, to prevent all news of strikes from spreading. Here
      indeed is where a special “struggle against the political
      police” is required, a struggle that can never be conducted
      actively by such large masses as take part in strikes. This
      struggle must be organised, according to “all the rules of the
      art”, by people who are professionally engaged in revolutionary
      activity. The fact that the masses are spontaneously being drawn
      into the movement does not make the organisation of this
      struggle less necessary. On the contrary, it makes it
      more necessary; for we socialists would be failing in
      our direct duty to the masses if we did not prevent the police
      from making a secret of every strike and every demonstration
      (and if we did not ourselves from time to time secretly prepare
      strikes and demonstrations). And we will succeed in doing
      this, because the spontaneously awakening masses will
      also produce increasing, numbers of “professional
      revolutionaries” from their own ranks (that is, if we
      do not take it into our heads to advise the workers to keep on
      marking time).


C. Organisation of Workers and Organisation of Revolutionaries

      It is only natural to expect that for a Social-Democrat whose
      conception of the political struggle coincides with the
      conception of the “economic struggle against the employers and
      the government”, the “organisation of revolutionaries” will more
      or less coincide with the “organisation of workers”. This, in

  

      fact, is what actually happens; so that when we speak of
      organisation, we literally speak in different tongues. I vividly
      recall, for example, a conversation I once had with a fairly
      consistent Economist, with whom I had not been previously
      acquainted. We were discussing the pamphlet, Who Will Bring
      About the Political Revolution? and were soon of a mind
      that its principal defect was its ignoring of the question of
      organisation. We had begun to assume full agreement between us;
      but, as the conversation proceeded, it became evident that we
      were talking of different things. My interlocutor accused the
      author of ignoring strike funds, mutual benefit societies, etc.,
      whereas I had in mind an organisation of revolutionaries as an
      essential factor in “bringing about” the political
      revolution. As soon as the disagreement became clear, there was
      hardly, as I remember, a single question of principle upon which
      I was in agreement with the Economist!


      What was the source of our disagreement? It was the fact that on
      questions both of organisation and of politics the Economists
      are forever lapsing from Social-Democracy into
      trade-unionism. The political struggle of Social-Democracy is
      far more extensive and complex than the economic struggle of the
      workers against the employers and the government. Similarly
      (indeed for that reason), the organisation of the revolutionary
      Social-Democratic Party must inevitably be of a kind
      different from the organisation of the workers designed for
      this struggle. The workers’ organisation must in the first place
      be a trade union organisation; secondly, it must be as broad as
      possible; and thirdly, it must be as public as conditions will
      allow (here, and further on, of course, I refer only to
      absolutist Russia). On the other hand, the organisation of the
      revolutionaries must consist first and foremost of people who
      make revolutionary activity their profession (for which reason I
      speak of the organisation of revolutionaries, meaning
      revolutionary Social-Democrats). In view of this common
      characteristic of the members of such an organisation, all
      distinctions as between workers and intellectuals, not to
      speak of distinctions of trade and profession, in both
      categories, must be effaced. Such an organisation must
      perforce not be very extensive and must be as secret as

  

      possible.  Let us examine this threefold distinction.


      In countries where political liberty exists the distinction
      between a trade union and a political organisation is clear
      enough, as is the distinction between trade unions and
      Social-Democracy.  The relations between the latter and the
      former will naturally vary in each country according to
      historical, legal, and other conditions; they may be more or
      less close, complex, etc. (in our opinion they should be as
      close and as little complicated as possible); but there can be
      no question in free countries of the organisation of trade
      unions coinciding with the organisation of the Social-Democratic
      Party. In Russia, however, the yoke of the autocracy appears at
      first glance to obliterate all distinctions between the
      Social-Democratic organisation and the workers’ associations,
      since all workers’ associations and all study
      circles are prohibited, and since the principal manifestation
      and weapon of the workers’ economic struggle — the strike — is
      regarded as a criminal (and sometimes even as a political!)
      offence. Conditions in our country, therefore, on the one hand,
      strongly “impel” the workers engaged in economic struggle to
      concern themselves with political questions, and, on the other,
      they “impel” Social-Democrats to confound trade-unionism with
      Social-Democracy (and our Krichevskys, Martynoys, and Co., while
      diligently discussing the first kind of “impulsion”, fail to
      notice the second).  Indeed, picture to yourselves people who
      are immersed ninety-nine per cent in “the economic struggle
      against the employers and the government”. Some of them will
      never, during the entire course of their activity (from
      four to six months), be impelled to think of the need for a more
      complex organisation of revolutionaries.  Others, perhaps, will
      come across the fairly widely distributed Bernsteinian
      literature, from which they will become convinced of the
      profound importance of the forward movement of “the drab
      everyday struggle”. Still others will be carried away, perhaps,
      by the seductive idea of showing the world a new example of
      “close and organic contact with the proletarian struggle” —
      contact between the trade union and the Social Democratic
      movements. Such people may argue that the later a country enters
      the arena of capitalism and, consequently, of the working-class

  

      movement, the more the socialists in that country may take part
      in, and support, the trade union movement, and the less the
      reason for the existence of non-Social-Democratic trade
      unions. So far the argument is fully correct; unfortunately,
      however, some go beyond that and dream of a complete fusion of
      Social-Democracy with trade-unionism. We shall soon see, from
      the example of the Rules of the St. Petersburg League of
      Struggle, what a harmful effect such dreams have upon our plans
      of organisation.


      The workers’ organisations for the economic struggle should be
      trade union organisations. Every Social-Democratic worker should
      as far as possible assist and actively work in these
      organisations. But, while this is true, it is certainly not in
      our interest to demand that only Social-Democrats should be
      eligible for membership in the “trade” unions, since that would
      only narrow the scope of our influence upon the masses. Let
      every worker who understands the need to unite for the struggle
      against the employers and the government join the trade
      unions. The very aim of the trade unions would be impossible of
      achievement, if they did not unite all who have attained at
      least this elementary degree of understanding, if they were not
      very broad organisations. The broader these
      organisations, the broader will be our influence over them — an
      influence due, not only to the “spontaneous” development of the
      economic struggle, but to the direct and conscious effort of the
      socialist trade union members to influence their comrades. But a
      broad organisation cannot apply methods of strict secrecy (since
      this demands far greater training than is required for the
      economic struggle). How is the contradiction between the need
      for a large membership and the need for strictly secret methods
      to be reconciled? How are we to make the trade unions as public
      as possible? Generally speaking, there can be only two ways to
      this end: either the trade unions become legalised (in some
      countries this preceded the legalisation of the socialist and
      political unions), or the organisation is kept secret, but so
      “free” and amorphous, lose[5]
  as the Germans say, that the need for secret
      methods becomes almost negligible as far as the bulk of the
      members is concerned.



      The legalisation of non-socialist and non-political labour
      unions in Russia has begun, and there is no doubt that every
      advance made by our rapidly growing Social-Democratic
      working-class movement will multiply and encourage attempts at
      legalisation — attempts proceeding for the most part from
      supporters of the existing order, but partly also from the
      workers themselves and from liberal intellectuals. The banner of
      legality has already been hoisted by the Vasilyevs and the
      Zubatovs.  Support has been promised and rendered by the Ozerovs
      and the Wormses,[21] and 
  followers of the new tendency are now to be
      found among the workers. Henceforth, we cannot but reckon with
      this tendency. How we are to reckon with it, on this there can
      be no two opinions among Social-Democrats. We must steadfastly
      expose any part played in this movement by the Zubatovs and the
      Vasilyeys, the gendarmes and the priests, and explain their real
      intentions to the workers. We must also expose all the
      conciliatory, “harmonious” notes that will be heard in the
      speeches of liberal politicians at legal meetings of the
      workers, irrespective of whether the speeches are motivated by
      an earnest conviction of the desirability of peaceful class
      collaboration, by a desire to curry favour with the powers that
      be, or whether they are simply the result of clumsiness. Lastly,
      we must warn the workers against the traps often set by the
      police, who at such open meetings and permitted societies spy
      out the “fiery ones” and try to make use of legal organisations
      to plant their agents provocateurs in the illegal
      organisations.


      Doing all this does not at all mean forgetting that in the
      long run the legalisation of the working-class movement
      will be, to our advantage, and not to that of the Zubatovs. On
      the contrary, it is precisely our campaign of exposure that will
      help us to separate the tares from the wheat. What the tares
      are, we have already indicated. By the wheat we mean attracting
      the attention of ever larger numbers, including the most
      backward sections, of the workers to social and political
      questions, and freeing ourselves, the revolutionaries, from
      functions that are essentially legal (the distribution of legal
      books, mutual aid, etc.), the development of which will
      inevitably provide us with an increasing quantity of material
      for agitation.  In this sense, we may, and should, say to the

  

      Zubatovs and the Ozerovs: Keep at it, gentlemen, do your best!
      Whenever you place a trap in the path of the workers (either by
      way of direct provocation, or by the “honest” demoralisation of
      the workers with the aid of “Struvism”) we will see to it that
      you are exposed. But whenever you take a real step forward,
      though it be the most “timid zigzag”, we will say: Please
      continue! And the only step that can be a real step forward is a
      real, if small, extension of the workers’ field of action. Every
      such extension will be to our advantage and will help to hasten
      the advent of legal societies of the kind in which it will not
      be agents provocateurs who are detecting socialists,
      but socialists who are gaining adherents. in a word, our task is
      to fight the tares. It is not our business to grow wheat in
      flower-pots. By pulling up the tares, we clear the soil for the
      wheat.  And while the Afanasy Ivanoviches and Pulkheria
      Ivanovnas[22] are 
  tending their flower-pot crops, we must prepare
      the reapers, not only to cut down the tares of today, but to
      reap the wheat of tomorrow.[6]


      Thus, we cannot by means of legalisation solve the
      problem of creating a trade union organisation that will be as
      little secret and as extensive as possible (but we should be
      extremely glad if the Zubatovs and the Ozerovs disclosed to us
      even a partial opportunity for such a solution — to this end,
      however, we must strenuously combat them). There remain
      secret trade union organisations, and we must give all possible
      assistance to the workers who (as we definitely know) are
      adopting this course. Trade union organisations, not only can be
      of tremendous value in developing and consolidating the economic
      struggle, but can also become a very important auxiliary to

  

      political agitation and revolutionary organisation. In order to
      achieve this purpose, and in order to guide the nascent trade
      union movement in the channels desired by Social-Democracy, we
      must first understand clearly the absurdity of the plan of
      organisation the St. Petersburg Economists have been nursing for
      nearly five years. That plan is set forth in the “Rules for a
      Workers’ Mutual Benefit Fund” of July 1897 (“Listok”
      Rabotnika, No. 9-10, p. 46, taken from Rabochaya
      Mysl, No. 1), as well as in the “Rules for a Trade Union
      Workers’ Organisation” of October 1900 (special leaflet printed
      in St. Petersburg and referred to in Iskra,
      No. 1). Both these sets of rules have one main shortcoming: they
      set up the broad workers’ organisation in a rigidly specified
      structure and confound it with the organisation of
      revolutionaries. Let us take the last-mentioned set of rules,
      since it is drawn up in greater detail. The body consists of
      fifty-two paragraphs. Twenty-three deal with the
      structure, the method of functioning, and the competence of the
      “workers’ circles”, which are to be organised in every factory
      (“a maximum of ten persons”) and which elect “central (factory)
      groups”. “The central group,” says paragraph 2, “observes all
      that goes on in its factory or workshop and keeps a record of
      events.” “The central group presents to subscribers a monthly
      financial account” (par. 17), etc. Ten paragraphs are devoted to
      the “district organisation”, and nineteen to the highly complex
      interconnection between the Committee of the Workers’
      Organisation and the Committee of the St.  Petersburg League of
      Struggle (elected representatives of each district and of the
      “executive groups” — “groups of propagandists, groups for
      maintaining contact with the provinces, and with the
      organisation abroad, groups for managing stores; publications,
      and funds”).


      Social-Democracy = “executive groups” in relation to the
      economic struggle of the workers! It would be difficult to show
      more glaringly how the Economists’ ideas deviate from
      Social-Democracy to trade-unionism, and how alien to them is any
      idea that a Social-Democrat must concern himself first and
      foremost with an organisation of revolutionaries capable of
      guiding the entire proletarian struggle for
      emancipation.  To talk of “the political emancipation of the

  

  working class” and of the struggle against “tsarist despotism”,
      and at the same time to draft rules like these, means to have no
      idea whatsoever of the real political tasks of
      Social-Democracy. Not one of the fifty or so paragraphs reveals
      even a glimmer of understanding that it is necessary to conduct
      the widest possible political agitation among the masses, an
      agitation highlighting every aspect of Russian absolutism and
      the specific features of the various social classes in
      Russia. Rules like these are of no use even for the achievement
      of trade union, let alone political, aims, since trade unions
      are organised by trades, of which no mention is made.


      But most characteristic, perhaps, is the amazing top-heaviness
      of the whole “system”, which attempts to bind each single
      factory and its “committee” by a permanent string of uniform and
      ludicrously petty rules and a three-stage system of
      election. Hemmed in by the narrow outlook of Economism, the mind
      is lost in details that positively reek of red tape and
      bureaucracy. In practice, of course, three-fourths of the
      clauses are never applied; on the other hand, a “secret”
      organisation of this kind, with its central group in each
      factory, makes it very easy for the gendarmes to carry out raids
      on a vast scale. The Polish cornrades have passed through a
      similar phase in their movement, with everybody enthusiastic
      about the extensive organisation of workers’ benefit funds; but
      they very quickly abandoned this idea when they saw that such
      organisations only provided rich harvests for the gendarmes. If
      we have in mind broad workers’ organisations, and not widespread
      arrests, if we do not want to provide satisfaction to the
      gendarmes, we must see to it that these organisations remain
      without any rigid formal structure. But will they be able to
      function in that case?


      Let us see what the functions are: “. . . To observe all that
      goes on in the factory and keep a record of events” (par. 2 of
      the Rules). Do we really require a formally established group
      for this purpose? Could not the purpose be better served by
      correspondence conducted in the illegal papers without the
      setting up of special groups? “. . . To lead the struggles of
      the workers for the improvement of their workshop conditions”
      (par. 3). This, too, requires no set organisational form. Any

  

      sensible agitator can in the course of ordinary conversation
      gather what the demands of the workers are and transmit them to
      a narrow — not a broad — organisation of revolutionaries for
      expression in a leaflet. “ ... To organise a fund ... to which
      subscriptions of two kopeks per ruble[7] should
      be made” (par. 9) — and then to present to subscribers a
      monthly financial account (par. 17), to expel members who fail
      to pay their contributions (par. 10), and so forth. Why, this is
      a very paradise for the police; for nothing would be easier for
      them than to penetrate into such a secrecy of a “central factory
      fund”, confiscate the money, and arrest the best people. Would
      it not be simpler to issue one-kopek or two-kopek coupons
      bearing the official stamp of a well-known (very narrow and very
      secret) organisation, or to make collections without coupons of
      any kind and to print reports in a certain agreed code in an
      illegal paper? The object would thereby be attained, but it
      would be a hundred times more difficult for the gendarmes to
      pick up clues.


      I could go on analysing the Rules, but I think that what has
      been said will suffice. A small, compact core of the most
      reliable, experienced, and hardened workers, with responsible
      representatives in the principal districts and connected by all
      the rules of strict secrecy with the organisation of
      revolutionaries, can, with the widest support of the masses and
      without any formal organisation, perform all the
      functions of a trade union organisation, in a manner, moreover,
      desirable to Social-Democracy.  Only in this way can we secure
      the consolidation and development of a
      Social-Democratic trade union movement, despite all the
      gendarmes.


      It may be objected that an organisation which is so
      lose that it is not even definitely formed, and which
      has not even an enrolled and registered membership, cannot be
      called an organisation at all. Perhaps so. Not the name is
      important. What is important is that this “organisation without
      members” shall do everything that is required, and from the very
      outset ensure a solid connection between our future trade unions
      and socialism. Only an incorrigible utopian would have a
      broad organisation of workers, with elections, reports,
      universal suffrage, etc., under the autocracy.



      The moral to be drawn from this is simple. If we begin with the
      solid foundation of a strong organisation of revolutionaries, we
      can ensure the stability of the movement as a whole and carry
      out the aims both of Social-Democracy and of trade unions
      proper.  If, however, we begin with a broad workers’
      organisation, which is supposedly most “accessible” to the
      masses (but which is actually most accessible to the gendarmes
      and makes revolutionaries most accessible to the police), we
      shall achieve neither the one aim nor the other; we shall not
      eliminate our rule-of-thumb methods, and, because we remain
      scattered and our forces are constantly broken up by the police,
      we shall only make trade unions of the Zubatov and Ozerov type
      the more accessible to the masses.


      What, properly speaking, should be the functions of the
      organisation of revolutionaries? We shall deal with this
      question in detail. First, however, let us examine a very
      typical argument advanced by our terrorist, who (sad fate!) in
      this matter also is a next-door neighbour to the
      Economist. Svoboda, a journal published for workers,
      contains in its first issue an article entitled “Organisation”,
      the author of which tries to defend his friends, the Economist
      workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk. He writes:



      “It is bad when the masses are mute and unenlightened, when the
      movement does not come from the rank and file. For instance, the
      students of a university town leave for their homes during the
      summer and other holidays, and immediately the workers’ movement
      comes to a standstill. Can a workers’ movement which has to be
      pushed on from outside be a real force? No, indeed.... It has
      not yet learned to walk, it is still in leading-strings. So it
      is in all matters. The students go off, and everything comes to
      a standstill. The most capable are seized; the cream is skimmed
      and the milk turns sour. If the ’committee’ is arrested,
      everything comes to a standstill until a new one can he
      formed. And one never knows what sort of committee will be set
      up next — it may be nothing like the former. The first said one
      thing, the second may say the very opposite. Continuity between
      yesterday and tomorrow is broken, the experience of the past
      does not serve as a guide for the future. And all because no
      roots have been struck in depth, in the masses; the work is
      carried on not by a hundred fools, but by a dozen wise men. A
      dozen wise men can be wiped out at a snap, but when the
      organisation embraces masses, everything proceeds from them, and
      nobody, however he tries, can wreck the cause” (p. 63).



      The facts are described correctly. The picture of our amateurism
      is well drawn. But the conclusions are worthy of Rabochaya

  

      Mysl, both as regards their stupidity and their lack of
      political tact. They represent the height of stupidity, because
      the author confuses the philosophical and social-historical
      question of the “depth” of the “roots” of the movement with the
      technical and organisational question of the best method in
      combating the gendarmes. They represent the height of political
      tactlessness, because, instead of appealing from bad leaders to
      good leaders, the author appeals from the leaders in general to
      the “masses” . This is as much an attempt to drag us back
      organisationally as the idea of substituting excitative
      terrorism for political agitation drags us back
      politically. Indeed, I am experiencing a veritable embarras
      de richesses, and hardly know where to begin to disentangle
      the jumble offered up by Svoboda. For clarity, let me
      begin by citing an example. Take the Germans. It will not be
      denied, I hope, that theirs is a mass organisation, that in
      Germany everything proceeds from the masses, that the
      working-class movement there has learned to walk. Yet observe
      how these millions value their “dozen” tried political leaders,
      how firmly they cling to them. Members of the hostile parties in
      parliament have often taunted the socialists by exclaiming:
      “Fine democrats you are indeed! Yours is a working-class
      movement only in name; in actual fact the same clique of leaders
      is always in evidence, the same Bebel and the same Liebknecht,
      year in and year out, and that goes on for decades. Your
      supposedly elected workers’ deputies are more permanent than the
      officials appointed by the Emperor!”  But the Germans only smile
      with contempt at these demagogic attempts to set the “masses”
      against the “leaders”, to arouse bad and ambitious instincts in
      the former, and to rob the movement of its solidity and
      stability by undermining the confidence of the masses in their
      “dozen wise men”. Political thinking is sufficiently developed
      among the Germans, and they have accumulated sufficient
      political experience to understand that without the “dozen”
      tried and talented leaders (and talented men are not born by the
      hundreds), professionally trained, schooled by long experience,
      and working in perfect harmony, no class in modern society can
      wage a determined struggle. The Germans too have had demagogues
      in their ranks who have flattered the “hundred fools”, exalted
      them above the “dozen

  

  wise men”, extolled the “horny hand” of
      the masses, and (like Most and Hasselmann) have spurred them on
      to reckless “revolutionary” action and sown distrust towards the
      firm and steadfast leaders. It was only by stubbornly and
      relentlessly combating all demagogic elements within the
      socialist movement that German socialism has managed to grow and
      become as strong as it is. Our wiseacres, however, at a time
      when Russian Social-Democracy is passing through a crisis
      entirely due to the lack of sufficiently trained, developed, and
      experienced leaders to guide the spontaneously awakening masses,
      cry out ,with the profundity of fools: “It is a bad business
      when the movement does not proceed from the rank and file.”


      “A committee of students is of no use; it is not stable.” Quite
      true. But the conclusion to be drawn from this is that we must
      have a committee of professional revolutionaries, and
      it is immaterial whether a student or a worker is capable of
      becoming a professional revolutionary. The conclusion you draw,
      how. ever, is that the working-class movement must not be pushed
      on from outside! In your political innocence you fail to notice
      that you are playing into the hands of our Economists and
      fostering our amateurism.  Wherein, may I ask, did our students
      “push on” our workers? In the sense that the student
      brought to the worker the fragments of political knowledge he
      himself possesses, the crumbs of socialist ideas he has managed
      to acquire (for the principal intellectual diet of the
      present-day student, legal Marxism, could furnish only the
      rudiments, only scraps of knowledge). There has never been too
      much of such “pushing on from outside”; on the
      contrary, there has so far been all too little of it in our
      movement, for we have been stewing too assiduously in our own
      juice; we have bowed far too slavishly to the elementary
      “economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the
      government”. We professional revolutionaries must and will make
      it our business to engage in this kind of “pushing on”
      a hundred times more forcibly than we have done hitherto. But
      the very fact that you select so hideous a phrase as “pushing on
      from outside” — a phrase which cannot but rouse in the workers
      (at least in the workers who are as unenlightened as you
      yourselves) a sense of distrust towards all who bring

  

  them political knowledge and revolutionary experience from
      outside, which cannot but rouse in them an instinctive desire to
      resist all such people — proves you to be demagogues,
      and demagogues are the worst enemies of the working
      class.


      And, please — don’t hasten howling about my “uncomradely
      methods” of debating. I have not the least desire to doubt the
      purity of your intentions. As I have said, one may become a
      demagogue out of sheer political innocence. But I have shown
      that you have descended to demagogy, and I will never tire of
      repeating that demagogues are the worst enemies of the working
      class. The worst enemies, because they arouse base instincts in
      the masses, because the unenlightened worker is unable to
      recognise his enemies in men who represent themselves, and
      sometimes sincerely so, as his friends. The worst enemies,
      because in the period of disunity and vacillation, when our
      movement is just beginning to take shape, nothing is easier than
      to employ demagogic methods to mislead the masses, who can
      realise their error only later by bitter experience. That is why
      the slogan of the day for the Russian Social-Democrat must be —
      resolute struggle against Svoboda and Rabocheye Dyelo,
      both of which have sunk to the level of demagogy. We shall deal
      with this further in greater detail.[8]


      “A dozen wise men can be more easily wiped out than a hundred
      fools.” This wonderful truth (for which the hundred fools will
      always applaud you) appears obvious only because in the very
      midst of the argument you have skipped from one question to
      another. You began by talking and continued to talk of the
      unearthing of a “committee”, of the unearthing of an
      “organisation”, and now you skip to the question of unearthing
      the movement’s “roots” in their “depths”. The fact is, of
      course, that our movement cannot be unearthed, for the very
      reason that it has countless thousands of roots deep down among
      the masses; but that is not the point at issue. As far as “deep
      roots” are concerned,

  

  we cannot be “unearthed” even now, despite
      all our amateurism, and yet we all complain, and cannot but
      complain, that the “organisations” are being unearthed
      and as a result it is impossible to maintain continuity in the
      movement. But since you raise the question of
      organisations being unearthed and persist in your
      opinion, I assert that it is far more difficult to unearth a
      dozen wise men than a hundred fools. This position I will
      defend, no matter how much you instigate the masses against me
      for my “anti-democratic” views, etc. As I have stated
      repeatedly, by “wise men”, in connection with organisation, I
      mean professional revolutionaries, irrespective of
      whether they have developed from among students or working
      men. I assert: (1) that no revolutionary movement can endure
      without a stable organisation of leaders maintaining continuity;
      (2) that the broader the popular mass drawn spontaneously into
      the struggle, which forms the basis of the movement and
      participates in it, the more urgent the need for such an
      organisation, and the more solid this organisation must be (for
      it is much easier for all sorts of demagogues to side-track the
      more backward sections of the masses); (3) that such an
      organisation must consist chiefly of people professionally
      engaged in revolutionary activity; (4) that in an autocratic
      state, the more we confine the membership of such an
      organisation to people who are professionally engaged in
      revolutionary activity and who have been professionally trained
      in the art of combating the political police, the more difficult
      will it be to unearth the organisation; and (5) the
      greater will be the number of people from the working
      class and from the other social classes who will be able to join
      the movement and perform active work in it.


      I invite our Economists, terrorists, and “Economists-terrorists”[9] to
      confute these propositions. At the moment, I shall deal only

  

      with the last two points. The question as to whether it is
      easier to wipe out “a dozen wisemen” or “a hundred fools”
      reduces itself to the question, above considered, whether it is
      possible to have a mass organisation when the
      maintenance of strict secrecy is essential. We can never give a
      mass organisation that degree of secrecy without which there can
      be no question of persistent and continuous struggle against the
      government. To concentrate all secret functions in the hands of
      as small a number of professional revolutionaries as possible
      does not mean that the latter will “do the thinking for all” and
      that the rank and file will not take an active part in the
      movement. On the contrary, the membership will promote
      increasing numbers of the professional revolutionaries from its
      ranks; for it will know that it is not enough for a few students
      and for a few working men waging the economic struggle to gather
      in order to form a “committee”, but that it takes years to train
      oneself to be a professional revolutionary; and the rank and
      file will “think”, not only of amateurish methods, but of such
      training. Centralisation of the secret functions of the
      organisation by no means implies centralisation of all
      the functions of the movement. Active participation of
      the widest masses in the illegal press will not diminish because
      a “dozen” professional revolutionaries centralise the secret
      functions connected with this work; on the contrary, it will
      increase tenfold. In this way, and in this way alone,
      shall we ensure that reading the illegal press, writing for it,
      and to some extent even distributing it, will almost cease
      to be secret work, for the police will soon come to realise
      the folly and impossibility of judicial and administrative
      red-tape procedure over every copy of a publication that is
      being distributed in the thousands. This holds not only for the
      press, but for every function of the movement, even for
      demonstrations. The active and widespread participation of the
      masses will not suffer; on the contrary, it will benefit by the
      fact that a “dozen” experienced revolutionaries, trained

  

      professionally no less than the police, will centralise all the
      secret aspects of the work — the drawing up of leaflets, the
      working out of approximate plans; and the appointing of bodies
      of leaders for each urban district, for each institution,
      etc. (I know that exception will be taken to my “undemocratic”
      views, but I shall reply below fully to this anything but
      intelligent objection.)  Centralisation of the most secret
      functions in an organisation of revolutionaries will not
      diminish, but rather increase the extent and enhance the quality
      of the activity of a large number of other organisations that
      are intended for a broad public and are therefore as loose and
      as non-secret as possible, such as workers’ trade unions;
      workers’ self-education circles and circles for reading illegal
      literature; and socialist, as well as democratic, circles among
      all other sections of the population; etc., etc. We
      must have such circles, trade unions, and organisations
      everywhere in as large a number as possible and with
      the widest variety of functions; but it would be absurd and
      harmful to confound them with the organisation of
      revolutionaries, to efface the border-line between
      them, to make still more hazy the all too faint recognition of
      the fact that in order to “serve” the mass movement we must have
      people who will devote themselves exclusively to
      Social-Democratic activities, and that such people must
      train themselves patiently and steadfastly to be
      professional revolutionaries.


      Yes, this recognition is incredibly dim. Our worst sin with
      regard to organisation consists in the fact that by our
      primitiveness we have lowered the prestige of revolutionaries in
      Russia. A person who is flabby and shaky on questions of
      theory, who has a narrow outlook, who pleads the spontaneity of
      the masses as an excuse for his own sluggishness, who resembles
      a trade union secretary more than a spokesman of the people, who
      is unable to conceive of a broad and bold plan that would
      command the respect even of opponents, and who is inexperienced
      and clumsy in his own professional art — the art of combating
      the political police — such a man is not a revolutionary, but a
      wretched amateur!


      Let no active worker take offence at these frank remarks, for as
      far as insufficient training is concerned, I apply them first
      and foremost to myself. I used to work in a study circle[23] that

  

      set itself very broad, all-embracing tasks; and all of us,
      members of that circle, suffered painfully and acutely from the
      realisation that we were acting as amateurs at a moment in
      history when we might have been able to say, varying a
      well-known statement: “Give us an organisation of
      revolutionaries, and we will overturn Russia” The more I recall
      the burning sense of shame I then experienced, the bitterer
      become my feelings towards those pseudo-Social-Democrats whose
      preachings “bring disgrace on the calling of a revolutionary”,
      who fail to understand that our task is not to champion the
      degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur, but
      to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries.


D. The Scope of Organisational Work

      We have heard B-v tell us about “the lack of revolutionary
      forces fit for action which is felt not only in St. Petersburg,
      but throughout Russia”. Hardly anyone will dispute this
      fact. But the question is, how is it to be explained? B-v
      writes:



      “We shall not go into an explanation of the historical causes of
      this phenomenon; we shall merely state that a society,
      demoralised by prolonged political reaction and split by past
      and present economic changes, promotes from its own ranks an
      extremely small number of persons fit for revolutionary
      work; that the working class does produce revolutionary
      workers who to some extent reinforce the ranks of the illegal
      organisations, but that the number of such revolutionaries is
      inadequate to meet the requirements of the times. This is all
      the more so because the worker who spends eleven and a half
      hours a day in the factory is in such a position that he can, in
      the main, perform only the functions of an agitator; but
      propaganda and organisation, the delivery and reproduction of
      illegal literature, the issuance of leaflets, etc., are duties
      which must necessarily fall mainly upon the shoulders of an
      extremely small force of intellectuals” (Rabocheye
      Dyelo, No. 6, pp. 38-39).



      On many points we disagree with B-v, particularly with those we
      have emphasised, which most saliently reveal that, although
      weary of our amateurism (as is every thinking practical worker),
      B-v cannot find the way out of this intolerable situation
      because he is weighted down by Economism. The fact is that
      society produces very many persons fit for “the cause”,

  

      but we are unable to make use of them all. The critical,
      transitional state of our movement in this respect may be
      formulated as follows: There are no people — yet there is a
      mass of people. There is a mass of people, because the
      working class and increasingly varied social strata, year after
      year, produce from their ranks an increasing number of
      discontented people who desire to protest, who are ready to
      render all the assistance they can in the struggle against
      absolutism, the intolerableness of which, though not yet
      recognised by all, is more and more acutely sensed by increasing
      masses of the people. At the same time, we have no people,
      because we have no leaders, no political leaders, no talented
      organisers capable of arranging. extensive and at the same time
      uniform and harmonious work that would employ all forces, even
      the most inconsiderable. “The growth and development of the
      revolutionary organisations” lag, not only behind the growth of
      the working-class movement, which even B-v admits, but behind
      that of the general democratic movement among all strata of the
      people. (In passing, probably B-V would now regard this as
      supplementing his conclusion.) The scope of revolutionary work
      is too narrow, as compared with the breadth of the spontaneous
      basis of the movement. It is too hemmed in by the wretched
      theory of “economic struggle against the employers and the
      government”. Yet, at the present time, not only
      Social-Democratic political agitators, but Social-Democratic
      organisers must “go among all classes of the population”.[10]
[10]
  Thus, an undoubted revival of the democratic spirit has recently been
  observed among persons in military service, partly as a
      consequence of the more frequent street battles with “enemies”
      like workers and students. As soon as our available forces
      permit, we must without fail devote the most serious attention
      to propaganda and agitation among soldiers and officers, and to
      the creation of “military organisations” affiliated to our
      Party.—Lenin


  There is hardly a single practical worker who will doubt that the
      Social-Democrats could distribute the thousand and one minute
      functions of their organisational work among individual
      representatives of the most varied classes. Lack of
      specialisation is one of the most serious defects of our
      technique, about which B-v justly and bitterly complains. The
      smaller each separate “operation” in our common cause the more

  

      people we can find capable of carrying out such operations
      (people who, in the majority of cases, are completely incapable
      of becoming professional revolutionaries); more difficult will
      it be for the police to “net” all these “detail workers”, and
      the more difficult will it be for them to frame up, out of an
      arrest for some petty affair, a “case” that would justify the
      government’s expenditure on “security”. As for the number of
      people ready to help us, we referred in the preceding chapter to
      the gigantic change that has taken place in this respect in the
      last five years or so. On the other hand, in order to unite all
      these tiny fractions into one whole, in order not to break up
      the movement while breaking up its functions, and in order to
      imbue the people who carry out the minute functions with the
      conviction that their work is necessary and important, without
      which conviction they will never do the work,[11]
[11]
  I recall that once a comrade told me of a factory inspector who
  wanted to help the Social-Democrats, and actually did, but
      complained bitterly that he did not know whether his
      “information” reached the proper revolutionary centre, how much
      his help was really required, and what possibilities there were
      for utilising his small and petty services. Every practical
      worker can, of course, cite many similar instances in which our
      primitiveness deprived us of allies.  These services, each
      “small” in itself, but invaluable when taken in the mass, could
      and would be rendered to us by office employees and officials,
      not only in factories, but in the postal service, on the
      railways, in the Customs, among the nobility, among the clergy,
      and in every other walk of life, including even the
      police and the Court!  Had we a real party, a real militant
      organisation of revolutionaries, we would not make undue demands
      on every one of these “aides”, we would not hasten always and
      invariably to bring them right into the very heart of our
      “illegality”, but, on the contrary, we would husband them most
      carefully and would even train people especially for such
      functions, bearing in mind that many students could be of much
      greater service to the Party as “aides” holding some official
      post than as “short-term” revolutionaries. But, I repeat, only
      an organisation that is firmly established and has no lack of
      active forces would have the right to apply such tactics.—Lenin


  it is necessary to
      have a strong organisation of tried revolutionaries. The more
      secret such an organisation is, the stronger and more widespread
      will be the confidence in the Party. As we know, in time of war,
      it is not only of the utmost importance to imbue one’s own army
      with confidence in its strength, but it is important also to
      convince the enemy and all neutral elements of this
      strength;

  

  friendly neutrality may sometimes decide the issue. If
      such an organisation existed, one built up on a firm theoretical
      foundation and possessing a Social-Democratic organ, we should
      have no reason to fear that the movement might be diverted from
      its path by the numerous “outside” elements that are attracted
      to it. (On the contrary, it is precisely at the present time,
      with amateurism prevalent, that we see many Social-Democrats
      leaning towards the Credo and only imagining that they
      are Social Democrats.) In a word, specialisation necessarily
      presupposes centralisation, and in turn imperatively calls for
      it.


      But B-v himself, who has so excellently described the necessity
      for specialisation, underestimates its importance, in our
      opinion, in the second part of the argument we have quoted. The
      number of working-class revolutionaries is inadequate, he says.
      This is perfectly true, and once again we stress that the “valuable
  communication of a close observer” fully confirms our
      view of the causes of the present crisis in Social-Democracy,
      and, consequently, of the means required to overcome it. Not
      only are revolutionaries in general lagging behind the
      spontaneous awakening of the masses, but even
      worker-revolutionaries are lagging behind the spontaneous
      awakening of the working-class masses. This fact
      confirms with clear evidence, from the “practical” point of
      view, too, not only the absurdity but even the politically
      reactionary nature of the “pedagogics” to which we are so
      often treated in the discussion of our duties to the
      workers. This fact proves that our very first and most pressing
      duty is to help to train working-class revolutionaries who will
      he on the same level in regard to Party activity as the
      revolutionaries from amongst the intellectuals (we emphasise the
      words “in regard to Party activity”, for, although necessary, it
      is neither so easy nor so pressingly necessary to bring the
      workers up to the level of intellectuals in other
      respects). Attention, therefore, must be devoted principally
      to raising the workers to the level of revolutionaries; it
      is not at all our task to descend to the level of the
      “working masses” as the Economists wish to do, or to the level
      of the “average worker” as Svoboda desires to do (and
      by this ascends to the second grade of Economist
      “pedagogics”). I am far from denying the necessity

  

  for popular literature for the workers, and especially popular (of course,
      not vulgar) literature for the especially backward workers. But
      what annoys me is this constant confusion of pedagogics with
      questions of politics and organisation. You, gentlemen, who are
      so much concerned about the “average worker”, as a matter of
      fact, rather insult the workers by your desire to talk
      down to them when discussing working-class politics and
      working-class organisation. Talk about serious things in a
      serious manner; leave pedagogics to the pedagogues, and not to
      politicians and organisers! Are there not advanced people,
      “average people”, and “masses” among the intelligentsia too?
      Does not everyone recognise that popular literature is also
      required for the intelligentsia, and is not such literature
      written? Imagine someone, in an article on organising college or
      high-school students, repeating over and over again, as if he
      had made a new discovery, that first of all we must have an
      organisation of “average students”. The author of such an
      article would be ridiculed, and rightly so. Give us your ideas
      on organisation, if you have any, he would be told, and we
      ourselves will decide who is “average”, who above average, and
      who below. But if you have no organisational ideas of your
      own, then all your exertions in behalf of the “masses” and
      “average people” will be simply boring. You must realise that
      these questions of “politics” and “organisation” are so serious
      in themselves that they cannot be dealt with in any other but a
      serious way. We can and must educate workers (and
      university and Gymnasium students) so that we may be able to
      discuss these questions with them. But once you do bring up
      these questions, you must give real replies to them; do not
      fall back on the “average”, or on the “masses”; do not try to
      dispose of the matter with facetious remarks and mere
      phrases.[12]



      To be fully prepared for his task, the worker-revolutionary must
      likewise become a professional revolutionary. Hence B-v is wrong
      in saying that since the worker spends eleven and a half hours
      in the factory, the brunt of all other revolutionary functions
      (apart from agitation) “must necessarily fall mainly
      upon the shoulders of an extremely small force of
      intellectuals”. But this condition does not obtain out of sheer
      “necessity”. It obtains because we are backward, because we do
      not recognise our duty to assist every capable worker to become
      a professional agitator, organiser, propagandist,
      literature distributor, etc., etc. In this respect, we waste our
      strength in a positively shameful manner; we lack the ability to
      husband that which should be tended and reared with special
      care. Look at the Germans: their forces are a hundredfold
      greater than ours. But they understand perfectly well that
      really capable agitators, etc., are not often promoted from the
      ranks of the “average”. For this reason they immediately try to
      place every capable working man in conditions that will enable
      him to develop and apply his abilities to the fullest: he is
      made a professional agitator, he is encouraged to widen the
      field of his activity, to spread it from one factory to the
      whole of the industry, from a single locality to the whole
      country. He acquires experience and dexterity in his profession;
      he broadens his outlook and increases his knowledge; he observes
      at close quarters the prominent political leaders from other
      localities and of other parties; he strives to rise to their
      level and combine in himself the knowledge of the working-class
      environment and the freshness of socialist convictions with
      professional skill, without which. the proletariat cannot
      wage a stubborn struggle against its excellently trained
      enemies. In this way alone do the working masses produce men of
      the stamp of Bebel and Auer. But what is to a great extent
      automatic in a politically free country must in Russia be done
      deliberately and systematically by our organisations. A
      worker-agitator who is at all gifted and “promising” must
      not be left to work eleven hours a day in a factory. We
      must arrange that he be maintained by the Party; that he may go
      underground in good time; that he change the place of his
      activity, if he is to enlarge his experience, widen his outlook,
      
  

  and be able to hold out for at least a few years in the struggle
      against the gendarmes. As the spontaneous rise of their movement
      becomes broader and deeper, the working-class masses promote
      from their ranks not only an increasing number of talented
      agitators, but also talented organisers, propagandists, and
      “practical workers” in the best sense of the term (of whom there
      are so few among our intellectuals who, for the most part, in
      the Russian manner, are somewhat careless and sluggish in their
      habits). When we have forces of specially trained
      worker-revolutionaries who have gone through extensive
      preparation (and, of course, revolutionaries “of all arms of the
      service”), no political police in the world will then be able to
      contend with them, for these forces, boundlessly devoted to the
      revolution, will enjoy the boundless confidence of the widest
      masses of the workers. We are directly to blame for
      doing too little to “stimulate” the workers to take this path,
      common to them and to the “intellectuals”, of professional
      revolutionary training, and for all too often dragging them back
      by our silly speeches about what is “accessible” to the masses
      of the workers, to the “average workers”, etc.


     In this, as in other respects, the narrow scope of our
      organisational work is without a doubt due directly to the fact
      (although the overwhelming majority of the “Economists” and the
      novices in practical work do not perceive it) that we restrict
      our theories and our political tasks to a narrow
      field. Subservience to spontaneity seems to inspire a fear of
      taking even one step away from what is “accessible” to the
      masses, a fear of rising too high above mere attendance on the
      immediate and direct requirements of the masses. Have no fear,
      gentlemen! Remember that we stand so low on the plane of
      organisation that the very idea that we could rise too
      high is absurd!


E. “Conspiratorial” Organisation
      and “Democratism”

  Yet there are many people among us who are so sensitive to the
      “voice of life” that they fear it more than anything in the world
      and charge the adherents of the views here expounded with
      following a Narodnaya Volya line,

  

  with failing to understand
      “democratism”, etc. These accusations, which, of course, have been
      echoed by Rabocheye Dyelo, need to be dealt with.


      The writer of these lines knows very well that the
      St. Petersburg Economists levelled the charge of Narodnaya Volya
      tendencies also against Rabochaya Gazeta (which is
      quite understandable when one compares it with Rabochaya
      Mysl). We were not in the least surprised, therefore, when,
      soon after the appearance of Iskra, a comrade informed
      us that the Soclal-Democrats in the town of X describe
      Iskra as a Narodnaya Volya organ. We, of course, were
      flattered by this accusation; for what decent Social-Democrat
      has not been accused by the Economists of being a Narodnaya
      Volya sympathiser?


  These accusations are the result of a twofold
      misunderstanding. First, the history of the revolutionary movement
      is so little known among us that the name “Narodnaya Volya” is
      used to denote any idea of a militant centralised organisation
      which declares determined war upon tsarism. But the magnificent
      organisation that the revolutionaries had in the seventies, and
      that should serve us as a model, was not established by the
      Narodnaya Volya, but by the Zemlya i Volya, which split
      up into the Chorny Peredel and the Narodnaya Volya. Consequently,
      to regard a militant revolutionary organisation as something
      specifically Narodnaya Volya in character is absurd both
      historically and logically; for no revolutionary trend,
      if it seriously thinks of struggle, can dispense with such an
      organisation. The mistake the Narodnaya Volya committed was not in
      striving to enlist all the discontented in the organisation and to
      direct this organisation to resolute struggle against the
      autocracy; on the contrary, that was its great historical
      merit. The mistake was in relying on a theory which in substance
      was not a revolutionary theory at all, and the Narodnaya Volya
      members either did not know how, or were unable, to link their
      movement inseparably with the class struggle in the developing
      capitalist society. Only a gross failure to understand Marxism (or
      an “understanding” of it in the spirit of “Struveism”) could
      prompt the opinion that the rise of a mass, spontaneous
      working-class movement relieves us of the duty of
      creating as good an organisation of revolutionaries as the Zemlya

  

      i Volya had, or, indeed, an incomparably better one. On the
      contrary, this movement imposes the duty upon us; for the
      spontaneous struggle of the proletariat will not become its
      genuine “class struggle” until this struggle is led by a strong
      organisation of revolutionaries.


     Secondly, many people, including apparently B. Krichevsky
      (Rabocheye Dyelo, No. 10, p. 18), misunderstand the
      polemics that Social-Democrats have always waged against the
      “conspiratorial” view of the political struggle. We have always
      protested, and will, of course, continue to protest against
      confining the political struggle to conspiracy.[13] But this
      does not, of course, mean that we deny the need for a strong
      revolutionary organisation. Thus, in the pamphlet mentioned in the
      preceding footnote, after the polemics against reducing the
      political struggle to a conspiracy, a description is given (as a
      Social-Democratic ideal) of an organisation so strong as to be
      able to “resort to. . .rebellion” and to every other form of
      attack, in order to “deliver a smashing blow against
      absolutism”.[14] In form
  such a strong revolutionary organisation in an autocratic country may also be
      described as a “conspiratorial” organisation, because the French
      word “conspiration” is the equivalent of the Russian word
      “zagovar” (“conspiracy”), and such an organisation must
      have the utmost secrecy. Secrecy is such a necessary condition for
      this kind of organisation that all the other conditions (number
      and selection of members, functions, etc.) must be made to conform

  

      to it. It would be extremely naive indeed, therefore, to fear the
      charge that we Social-Democrats desire to create a conspiratorial
      organisation. Such a charge should be as flattering to every
      opponent of Economism as the charge of following a Narodnaya Volya
      line.


      The objection may be raised that such a powerful and strictly
      secret organisation, which concentrates in its hands all the
      threads of secret activities, an organisation which of necessity
      is centralised, may too easily rush into a premature attack, may
      thoughtlessly intensify the movement before the growth of
      political discontent, the intensity of the ferment and anger of
      the working class, etc., have made such an attack possible and
      necessary. Our reply to this is: Speaking abstractly, it cannot
      be denied, of course, that a militant organisation may
      thoughtlessly engage in battle, which may end in a
      defeat entirely avoidable under other conditions. But we cannot
      confine ourselves to abstract reasoning on such a question,
      because every battle bears within itself the abstract
      possibility of defeat, and there is no way of reducing
  this possibility except by organised preparation for
      battle. If, however, we proceed from the concrete conditions at
      present obtaining in Russia, we must come to the positive
      conclusion that a strong revolutionary organisation is
      absolutely necessary precisely for the purpose of giving
      stability to the movement and of safeguarding it
      against the possibility of making thoughtless attacks. Precisely
      at the present time, when no such organisation yet exists, and
      when the revolutionary movement is rapidly and spontaneously
      growing, we already observe two opposite extremes
      (which, as is to be expected, “meet”). These are: the utterly
      unsound Economism and the preaching of moderation, and the
      equally unsound “excitative terror”, which strives “artificially
      to call forth symptoms of the end of the movement, which is
      developing and strengthening itself, when this movement is as
      yet nearer to the start than to the end” (V. Zasulich, in
      Zarya, No. 2-3, p. 353). And the instance of 
  Rabocheye Dyelo shows that there exist 
  Social-Democrats who give way to both these
      extremes. This is not surprising, for, apart from other reasons,
      the “economic struggle against the employers and the government”

  

  can never satisfy revolutionaries, and opposite
      extremes will therefore always appear here and there. Only a
      centralised, militant organisation that consistently carries out
      a Social-Democratic policy, that satisfies, so to speak, all
      revolutionary instincts and strivings, can safeguard the
      movement against making thoughtless attacks and prepare attacks
      that hold out the promise of success.


     A further objection may be raised, that the views on
      organisation here expounded contradict the “democratic
      principle”. Now, while the earlier accusation was specifically
      Russian in origin, this one is specifically foreign in
      character. And only an organisation abroad (the Union of Russian
      Social-Democrats Abroad) was capable of giving its Editorial Board
      instructions like the following:



      “Organisational Principle. In order to secure the
      successful development and unification of Social-Democracy, the
      broad democratic principle of Party organisation must be
      emphasised, developed, and fought for; this is particularly
      necessary in view of the anti-democratic tendencies that have
      revealed themselves in the ranks of our Party” (Two
      Conferences, p. 18).



      We shall see in the next chapter how Rabocheye Dyelo
      combats Iskra’s “anti-democratic tendencies”. For the
      present, we shall examine more closely the “principle” that the
      Economists advance. Everyone will probably agree that “the broad
      democratic principle” presupposes the two following conditions:
      first, full publicity, and secondly, election to all offices. It
      would be absurd to speak of democracy without publicity,
      moreover, without a publicity that is not limited to the
      membership of the organisation. We call the German Socialist
      Party a democratic organisation because all its activities are
      carried out publicly; even its party congresses are held in
      public. But no one would call an organisation democratic that is
      hidden from every one but its members by a veil of secrecy. What
      is the use, then, of advancing “the broad democratic
      principle” when the fundamental condition for this principle
      cannot be fulfilled by a secret organisation? “The
      broad principle” proves itself simply to be a resounding but
      hollow phrase. Moreover, it reveals a total lack of
      understanding of the urgent tasks of the moment in regard to
      organisation. Everyone knows how great the lack of secrecy is
      among the “broad” masses

  

  of our revolutionaries. We have heard
      the bitter complaints of B-v on this score and his absolutely
      just demand for a “strict selection of members” (Rabocheye
      Dyelo, No. 6, p. 42). Yet, persons who boast a keen “sense
      of realities” urge, in a situation like this, not the
      strictest secrecy and the strictest (consequently, more
      restricted) selection, of members, but “the broad
  democratic principle”! This is what you call being wide of
      the mark.


      Nor is the situation any better with regard to the second
      attribute of democracy, the principle of election. In
      politically free countries, this condition is taken for
      granted. “They are members of the Party who accept the
      principles of the Party programme and render the Party all
      possible support,” reads Clause 1 of the Rules of the German
      Social-Democratic Party. Since the entire political arena is as
      open to the public view as is a theatre stage to the audience,
      this acceptance or non-acceptance, support or opposition, is
      known to all from the press and from public meetings. Everyone
      knows that a certain political figure began in such and such a
      way, passed through such and such an evolution, behaved in a
      trying moment in such and such a manner, and possesses such and
      such qualities; consequently, all party members,
      knowing all the facts, can elect or refuse to elect this person
      to a particular party office. The general control (in the
      literal sense of the term) exercised over every act of a party
      man in the political field brings into existence an
      automatically operating mechanism which produces what in biology
      is called the “survival of the fittest”. “Natural selection” by
      full publicity, election, and general control provides the
      assurance that, in the last analysis, every political figure
      will be “in his proper place”, do the work for which lie is best
      fitted by his powers and abilities, feel the effects of his
      mistakes on himself, and prove before all the world his ability
      to recognise mistakes and to avoid them.


     Try to fit this picture into the frame of our autocracy! Is it
      conceivable in Russia for all who accept the principles of the
      Party programme and render the Party all possible support to
      control every action of the revolutionary working in secret? Is
      it possible for all to elect one of these revolutionaries to any
      particular office, when, in the very interests of the work, the
      revolutionary must conceal his identity from nine out of ten of

  

      these “all”? Reflect somewhat over the real meaning of the
      high-sounding phrases to whichRabocheye Dyelo gives
      utterance, and you will realise that “broad democracy” in Party
      organisation, amidst the gloom of the autocracy and the
      domination of gendarmerie, is nothing more than a useless
      and harmful toy. It is a useless toy because, in point of
      fact, no revolutionary organisation has ever practiced, or could
      practice, broad democracy, however much it may have
      desired to do so. It is a harmful toy because any attempt to
      practise “the broad democratic principle” will simply facilitate
      the work of the police in carrying out large-scale raids, will
      perpetuate the prevailing primitiveness, and will divert the
      thoughts of the practical workers from the serious and pressing
      task of training themselves to become professional
      revolutionaries to that of drawing up detailed “paper” rules for
      election systems. Only abroad, where very often people with no
      opportunity for conducting really active work gather, could this
      “playing at democracy” develop here and there, especially in
      small groups.

 
To show the unseemliness of Rabocheye Dyelo’s
    favourite trick of advancing the plausible “principle” of
    democracy in revolutionary affairs, we shall again summon a
    witness. This witness, Y. Serebryakov, editor of the London
    magazine, Nakanune, has a soft spot for Rabocheye
    Dyelo and is filled with a great hatred for Plekhanov and the
    “Plekhanovites”. In its articles on the split in the Union of
    Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, Nakanune definitely
    sided with Rabocheye Dyelo and poured a stream of petty
    abuse upon Plekhanov. All the more valuable, therefore, is this
    witness in the question at issue. In Nakanune for July
    (No. 7) 1899, an article entitled “Concerning the Manifesto of the
    Self-Emancipation of the Workers Group”, Serebryakov argued that
    it was “indecent” to talk about such things as “self-deception,
    leadership, and the so-called Areopagus in a serious revolutionary
    movement” and, inter alia, wrote:



    “Myshkin, Rogachov, Zhelyabov, Mikhailov,
    Perovskaya, Figner, and others never regarded themselves as
    leaders, and no one ever elected or appointed them as such,
    although in actuality, they were leaders, because, in the
    propaganda period, as well as in the period of the struggle
    against the government, they took the brunt of the work upon
    themselves, they went into the most dangerous places, and their

  

activities were the most fruitful. They became leaders, not
    because they wished it, but because the comrades surrounding them
    had confidence in their wisdom, in their energy, in their
    loyalty. To be afraid of some kind of Areopagus (if it is not
    feared, why write about it?) that would arbitrarily govern the
    movement is far too naive. Who would pay heed to it?”



    We ask the reader, in what way does the “Areopagus” differ from
    “anti  democratic tendencies”? And is it not evident that
    Rabocheye Dyelo’s “plausible” organisational principle is
    equally naive and indecent; naive, because no one would pay heed
    to the “Areopagus”, or people with “anti- democratic tendencies”,
    if “the comrades surrounding them had” no “confidence in their
    wisdom, energy, and loyalty”; indecent, because it is a demagogic
    sally calculated to play on the conceit of some, on the ignorance
    of others regarding the actual state of our movement, and on the
    lack of training and the ignorance of the history of the
    revolutionary movement on the part of still others. The only
    serious organisational principle for the active workers of our
    movement should he the strictest secrecy, the strictest selection
    of members, and the training of professional
    revolutionaries. Given these qualities, something even more than
    “democratism” would be guaranteed to us, namely, complete,
    comradely, mutual confidence among revolutionaries. This is
    absolutely essential for us, because there can be no question of
    replacing it by general democratic control in Russia. It would be
    a great mistake to believe that the impossibility of establishing
    real “democratic” control renders the members of the revolutionary
    organisation beyond control altogether. They have not the time to
    think about toy forms of democratism (democratism within a close
    and compact body of comrades in which complete, mutual confidence
    prevails), but they have a lively sense of their
    responsibility, knowing as they do from experience that
    an organisation of real revolutionaries will stop at nothing to
    rid itself of an unworthy member. Moreover, there is a fairly
    well-developed public opinion in Russian (and international)
    revolutionary circles which has a long history behind it, and
    which sternly and ruthlessly punishes every departure from the
    duties of comradeship (and “democratism”, real and not toy
    democratism, certainly forms a component part of the conception of

  

comradeship). Take all this into consideration and you will
    realise that this talk and these resolutions about
    “anti-democratic tendencies” have the musty odour of the playing
    at generals which is indulged in abroad.


    It must be observed also that the other source of this talk,
    viz., naivete is likewise fostered by the confusion of ideas
    concerning the meaning of democracy. In Mr. and Mrs. Webb’s book
    on the English trade unions there is an interesting chapter
    entitled “Primitive Democracy”. In it the authors relate how the
    English workers, in the first period of existence of their unions,
    considered it an indispensable sign of democracy for all the
    members to do all the work of managing the unions; not only were
    all questions decided by the vote of all the members, but all
    official duties were fulfilled by all the members in turn. A long
    period of historical experience was required for worker’s to
    realise the absurdity of such a conception of democracy and to
    make them understand the necessity for representative
    institutions, on the one hand, and for full-time officials, on the
    other. Only after a number of cases of financial bankruptcy of
    trade union treasuries had occurred did the workers realise that
    the rates of contributions and benefits cannot be decided merely
    by a democratic vote, but that this requires also the advice of
    insurance experts. Let us take also Kautsky’s book on
    parliamentarism and legislation by the people. There we find that
    the conclusions drawn by the Marxist theoretician coincide with
    the lessons learned from many years of practical experience by the
    workers who organised “spontaneously”. Kautsky strongly protests
    against Rittinghausen’s primitive conception of democracy; he
    ridicules those who in the name of democracy demand that “popular
    newspapers shall be edited directly by the people”; he shows the’
    need for professional journalists, parliamentarians,
    etc., for the Social-Democratic leadership of the proletarian
    class struggle; he attacks the socialism of anarchists and
    litterateurs who in their “striving for effect” extol
    direct legislation by the whole people, completely failing to
    understand that this idea can be applied only relatively in modern
    society.


    Those who have performed practical work in our movement know
    how widespread the “primitive” conception of democracy is among

  

    the masses of the students and workers. It is not surprising that
    this conception penetrates also into rules of organisations and
    into literature. The Economists of the Bernsteinian persuasion
    included in their rules the following: “§ 10. All affairs
    affecting the interests of the whole of the union organisation
    shall be decided by a majority vote of all its members.” The
    Economists of the terrorist persuasion repeat after them. “The
    decisions of the committee shall become effective only after they
    have been referred to all the circles” (Svoboda, No. 1,
    p. 67). Observe that this proposal for a widely applied referendum
    is advanced in addition to the demand that the whole
    of the organisation be built on an elective basis! We would
    not, of course, on this account condemn practical workers who have
    had too few opportunities for studying the theory and practice of
    real democratic organisations. But when Rabocheye Dyelo,
    which lays claim to leadership, confines itself, under such
    conditions, to a resolution on broad democratic principles, can
    this be described as anything but a mere “striving for
    effect”?


F. Local and All-Russia Work

    The objections raised against the plan of organisation here
    outlined on the grounds that it is undemocratic and conspiratorial
    are totally unsound. Nevertheless, there remains a question which
    is frequently put and which deserves detailed examination. This is
    the question of the relations between local work and all-Russia
    work. Fears are expressed that the formation of a centralised
    organisation may shift the centre of gravity from the former to
    the latter, damage the movement through weakening our contacts
    with the working masses and the continuity of local agitation
    generally. To these fears we reply that our movement in the past
    few years has suffered precisely from the fact that local workers
    have been too absorbed in local work; that therefore it is
    absolutely necessary to shift the centre of gravity somewhat to
    national work; and that, far from weakening this would strengthen
    our ties and the continuity of our local agitation. Let us take
    the question of central and local newspapers. I would ask the
    reader not to forget that we cite the publication of newspapers
    only as an example illustrating an immeasurably broader

  


    and more varied revolutionary activity in general.


    In the first period of the mass movement (1896-98), an attempt
    was made by local revolutionary workers to publish an all-Russia
    paper — Rabochaya Gazeta. In the next period
    (1898-1900), the movement made an enormous stride forward, but the
    attention of the leaders was wholly absorbed by local
    publications. If we compute the total number of the local papers
    that were published, we shall find that on the average one issue
    per month was published.[15] Does this not clearly illustrate our
    amateurism? Does this not clearly show that our revolutionary
    organisation lags behind the spontaneous growth of the movement?
    If the same number of issues had been published, not by
    scattered local groups, but by a single organisation, we would not
    only have saved an enormous amount of effort, but we would have
    secured immeasurably greater stability and continuity in our
    work. This simple point is frequently lost sight of by those
    practical workers who work actively and almost
    exclusively on local publications (unfortunately this is true even
    now in the overwhelming majority of cases), as well as by the
    publicists who display an astonishing quixotism on this
    question. The practical workers usually rest content with the
    argument that “it is difficult”[16]
[16]
    This difficulty is more apparent than real. In fact, there is not
    a single local study circle that lacks the opportunity of taking up some 
function or other in connection with all-Russia work. “Don’t say,
I can’t; say, I won’t.”—Lenin


for local workers to engage in the
    organisation of an all-Russia newspaper, and that local newspapers
    are better than no newspapers at all. This argument is, of course,
    perfectly just, and we, no less than any practical worker,
    appreciate the enormous importance and usefulness of local
    newspapers in general. But not this is the point. The
    point is, can we not overcome the fragmentation and primitiveness
    that are so glaringly expressed in the thirty issues of local
    newspapers that have been published throughout Russia in the
    course of two and a half years? Do not restrict yourselves to the
    indisputable, but too general, statement about the usefulness of

  

    local newspapers generally; have the courage frankly to admit
    their negative aspects revealed by the experience of two and a
    half years. This experience has shown that under the conditions in
    which we work, these local newspapers prove, in the majority of
    cases, to be unstable in their principles, devoid of political
    significance, extremely costly in regard to expenditure of
    revolutionary forces, and totally unsatisfactory from a technical
    point of view (I have in mind, of course, not the technique of
    printing, but the frequency and regularity of publication). These
    defects are riot accidental; they are the inevitable outcome of
    the fragmentation which, on the one hand, explains the
    predominance of local newspapers in the period under review, and,
    on the other, is fostered by this predominance. It is
    positively beyond the strength of a separate local organisation to
    raise its newspaper to the level of a political organ maintaining
    stability of principles; it is beyond its strength to
    collect and utilise sufficient material to shed light on the whole
    of our political life. The argument usually advanced to support
    the need for numerous local newspapers in free countries that the
    cost of printing by local workers is low and that the people can
    be kept more fully and quickly informed — this argument as
    experience has shown, speaks against local newspapers in
    Russia. They turn out to be excessively costly in regard to the
    expenditure of revolutionary forces, and appear very rarely, for
    the simple reason that the publication of an illegal
    newspaper, however small its size, requires an extensive secret
    apparatus, such as is possible with large-scale factory
    production; for this apparatus cannot be created in a small,
    handicraft workshop. Very frequently, the primitiveness of the
    secret apparatus (every practical worker can cite numerous cases)
    enables the police to take advantage of the publication and
    distribution of one or two issues to make mass arrests,
    which result in such a clean sweep that it becomes necessary to
    start all over again. A well-organised secret apparatus requires
    professionally well-trained revolutionaries and a division of
    labour applied with the greatest consistency, but both these
    requirements are beyond the strength of a separate local
    organisation, however strong it may be at any given moment. Not

  

    only the general interests of our movement as a whole (training of
    the workers in consistent socialist and political principles) but
    also specifically local interests are better served by
    non-local newspapers. This may seem paradoxical at first
    sight, but it has been proved to the hilt by the two and a half
    years of experience referred to. Everyone will agree that had all
    the local forces that were engaged in the publication of the
    thirty issues of newspapers worked on a single newspaper, sixty,
    if not a hundred, issues could easily have been published, with a
    fuller expression, in consequence, of all the specifically local
    features of the movement. True, it is no easy matter to attain
    such a degree of organisation, but we must realise the need for
    it. Every local study circle must think about it and work
    actively to achieve it, without waiting for an impetus from
    outside, without being tempted by the popularity and closer
    proximity of a local newspaper which, as our revolutionary
    experience has shown, proves to a large extent to be illusory.


      And it is a bad service indeed those publicists render to the
      practical work who, thinking themselves particularly (close to
      the practical workers, fail to see this illusoriness, and make
      shift with the astoundingly hollow and cheap argument that we
      must have local newspapers, we must have district newspapers,
      and we must have all-Russia newspapers. Generally speaking, of
      course, all these are necessary, but once the solution of a
      concrete organisational problem is undertaken, surely time and
      circumstances must be taken into consideration. Is it not
      quixotic for Svoboda (No. 1, p. 68) to write in a
      special article “dealing with the question of a
      newspaper”: “It seems to us that every locality, with any
      appreciable number of workers, should have its own workers’
      newspaper; not a newspaper imported from somewhere, but its very
      own.” If the publicist who wrote these words refuses to think of
      their meaning, then at least the reader may do it for him. How
      many scores, if not hundreds, of “localities” with any
      appreciable number of workers there are in Russia, and what a
      perpetuation of our amateurish methods this would mean if indeed
      every local organisation set about publishing its
      own. newspaper! How this diffusion would facilitate the
      gendarmerie’s task of netting — and without “any appreciable”
      effort — the local revolutionary workers at the very outset of

  

      their activity and of preventing them from developing into real
      revolutionaries. A reader of an all-Russia newspaper, continues
      the author, would find little interest in the descriptions of
      the. malpractices of the factory owners and the “details of
      factory life in various towns not his own”. But “an inhabitant
      of Orel would not find Orel affairs dull reading. In every issue
      he would learn who had been ’picked for a lambasting’ and who
      had been ’flayed’, and he would be in high spirits”
      (p. 69). Certainly, the Orel reader is in high spirits, but our
      publicist’s flights of imagination are also high — too high. He
      should have asked himself whether such concern with trivialities
      is tactically in order. We are second to none in appreciating
      the importance and necessity of factory exposures, but it must
      be borne in mind that we have reached a stage when
      St. Petersburg folk find it dull reading the St. Petersburg
      correspondence of the St. Petersburg Rabochaya
      Mysl. Leaflets are the medium through which local factory
      exposures have always been and must continue to be
      made, but we must raise the level of the newspaper, not
      lower it to the level of a factory leaflet. What we ask of a
      newspaper is not so much “petty” exposures, as exposures of the
      major, typical evils of factory life, exposures based on
      especially striking facts and capable, therefore, of arousing
      the interest of all workers and all leaders of the movement, of
      really enriching their knowledge, broadening their outlook, and
      serving as a starting-point for awakening new districts and
      workers from ever-newer trade areas.


      “Moreover, in a local newspaper, all the malpractices of the
      factory administration and other authorities may he denounced
      then and there. In the case of a general, distant newspaper,
      however, by the time the news reaches it the facts will have
      been forgotten in the source localities. The reader, on getting
      the paper, will exclaim: ’When was that-who remembers it?’”
      (ibid.). Precisely — who remembers it! From the same
      source we learn that the 30 issues of newspapers which appeared
      in the course of two and a half years were published in six
      cities. This averages one issue per city per half-year!
      And even if our frivolous publicist trebled his
      estimate of the productivity of local work (which would be wrong
      in the case of an average town, since it is impossible to

  

      increase productivity to any considerable extent by our
      rule-of-thumb methods), we would still get only one issue every
      two months, i.e., nothing at all like “denouncing then and
      there”. It would suffice, however, for ten local organisations
      to combine and send their delegates to take an active part in
      organising a general newspaper, to enable us every fortnight to
      “denounce”, over the whole of Russia, not petty, but
      really outstanding and typical evils. No one who knows the state
      of affairs in our organisations can have the slightest doubt on
      that score. As for catching the enemy red-handed — if we mean
      it seriously and not merely as a pretty phrase — that is quite
      beyond the ability of an illegal paper generally. It can be done
      only by a leaflet, because the time limit for exposures of that
      nature can be a day or two at the most (e.g., the usual brief
      strikes, violent factory clashes, demonstrations, etc.).


      “The workers live not only at the factory, but also in the
      city,” continues our author, rising from the particular to the
      general, with a strict consistency that would have done honour
      to Boris Krichevsky himself; and he refers to matters like
      municipal councils, municipal hospitals, municipal schools, and
      demands that workers’ newspapers should not ignore municipal
      affairs in general.


      This demand — excellent in itself — serves as a particularly
      vivid illustration of the empty abstraction to which discussions
      of local newspapers are all too frequently limited. In the first
      place, if indeed newspapers appeared “in every locality with any
      appreciable number of workers” with such detailed information on
      municipal affairs as Svoboda desires, this would, under
      our Russian conditions, inevitably degenerate into actual
      concern with trivialities, lead to a weakening of the
      consciousness of the importance of an all-Russia revolutionary
      assault upon the tsarist autocracy, and strengthen the extremely
      virile shoots — not uprooted but rather hidden or temporarily
      suppressed — of the tendency that has become noted as a result
      of the famous remark about revolutionaries who talk a great deal
      about non-existent parliaments and too little about existent
      municipal councils. We say “inevitably”, in order to emphasise
      that Svoboda obviously does not desire this, but the
      contrary, to come about. But good intentions are not enough. For
      municipal affairs to be dealt with in their proper perspective,

  

      in relation to our entire work, this perspective must
      first be clearly conceived, firmly established, not
      only by argument, but by numerous examples, so that it may
      acquire the stability of a tradition. This is still far
      from being the case with us. Yet this must be done
      first, before we can allow ourselves to think and talk
      about an extensive local press.


      Secondly, to write really well and interestingly about municipal
      affairs, one must have first-hand knowledge, not book knowledge,
      of the issues. But there are hardly any Social-Democrats
      anywhere in Russia who possess such knowledge. To be
      able to write in newspapers (not in popular pamphlets) about
      municipal and state affairs, one must have fresh and varied
      material gathered and written up by able people. And in order to
      be able to gather and write up such material, we must have
      something more than the “primitive democracy” of a primitive
      circle, in which everybody does everything and all entertain
      themselves by playing at referendums. It is necessary to have a
      staff of expert writers and correspondents, an army of
      Social-Democratic reporters who establish contacts far and wide,
      who are able to fathom all sorts of “state secrets” (the
      knowledge of which makes the Russian government official so
      puffed up, but the blabbing of which is such an easy matter to
      him), who are able to penetrate “behind the scenes” — an army
      of’ people who must, as their “official duty”, be ubiquitous and
      omniscient. And we, the Party that fights against all economic,
      political, social, and national oppression, can and must find,
      gather, train, mobilise, and set into motion such an army of
      omniscient people — all of which requires still to be done. Not
      only has not a single step in this direction been taken in the
      overwhelming majority of localities, but even the recognition of
      its necessity is very often lacking. One will search in vain in
      our Social-Democratic press for lively and interesting articles,
      correspondence, and exposures dealing with our big and little
      affairs — diplomatic, military, ecclesiastical, municipal,
      financial, etc., etc. There is almost nothing, or very
      little, about these matters.[17] That is why “it always annoys me

  

  frightfully when a man comes to me, utters beautiful and
      charming words” about the need for newspapers in “every locality
      with any appreciable number of workers” that will expose
      factory, municipal, and government evils.


      The predominance of the local papers over a central press may be
      a sign of either poverty or luxury. Of poverty, when the
      movement has not yet developed the forces for large-scale
      production, continues to flounder in amateurism, and is all but
      swamped with “the petty details of factory life”. Of luxury,
      when the movement has fully mastered the task of
      comprehensive exposure and comprehensive agitation, and it
      becomes necessary to publish numerous local newspapers in
      addition to the central organ. Let each decide for himself what
      the predominance of local newspapers implies in present-day
      Russia. I shall limit myself to a precise formulation of my own
      conclusion, to leave no grounds for misunderstanding. Hitherto,
      the majority of our local organisations have thought almost
      exclusively in terms of local newspapers, and have devoted
      almost all their activities to this work. This is abnormal; the
      very opposite should have been the case. The majority of the
      local organisations should think principally of the publication
      of an all-Russia newspaper and devote their activities chiefly
      to it. Until this is done, we shall not be able to establish a
      single newspaper capable, to any degree, of serving the
      movement with comprehensive press agitation. When this
      is done, however, normal relations between the necessary central
      newspaper and the necessary local newspapers will be established
      automatically.


 *     *  * 

      It would seem at first glance that the conclusion on the
      necessity for shifting the centre of gravity from local to
      all-Russia work does not apply to the sphere of the specifically
      economic struggle. In this struggle, the immediate enemies of
      the  workers are the individual employers or groups of
      employers, who are not bound by any organisation having even the
      remotest resemblance to the purely military, strictly
      centralised organisation of the Russian Government — our
      immediate enemy in the political struggle — which is led in all
      its minutest details by a single will.


      But that is not the case. As we have repeatedly pointed out, the
      economic struggle is a trade struggle, and for that reason it
      requires that the workers be organised according to trades, not
      only according to place of employment. Organisation by trades
      becomes all the more urgently necessary, the more rapidly our
      employers organise in all sorts of companies and syndicates. Our
      fragmentation and our amateurism are an outright hindrance to
      this work of organisation which requires the existence of a
      single, all-Russia body of revolutionaries capable of giving
      leadership to the all-Russia trade unions. We have described
      above the type of organisation that is needed for this purpose;
      we shall now add but a few words on the question of our press in
      this connection.


      Hardly anyone will doubt the necessity for every
      Social-Democratic newspaper to have a special
      department devoted to the trade union (economic)
      struggle. But the growth of the trade union movement compels us
      to think about the creation of a trade union press. It seems to
      us, however, that with rare exceptions, there can be no question
      of trade union newspapers in Russia at the present time; they
      would be a luxury, and many a time we lack even our daily
      bread. The form of trade union press that would suit the
      conditions of our illegal work and is already required at the
      present time is trade union pamphlets. In these
      pamphlets, legal[18] and illegal material should be
  gathered and grouped systematically, on the working conditions
      in a given trade, on the differences in this respect in the
      various parts of, Russia; on the main demands advanced by the
      workers in the given trade; on the inadequacies of legislation
      affecting that trade; on outstanding instances of economic
      struggle by the workers in the trade; on the beginnings, the
      present state, and the requirements of their trade union
      organisation, etc. Such pamphlets would, in the first place,
      relieve our Social-Democratic press of a mass of trade details
      that are of interest only to workers in the given
      trade. Secondly, they would record the results of our experience
      in the trade union struggle, they would preserve the gathered
      material, which now literally gets lost in a mass of leaflets
      and fragmentary correspondence; and they would summarise this
      material. Thirdly, they could serve as guides for agitators,
      because working conditions change relatively slow ly and the
      main demands of the workers in a given trade are extremely
      stable (cf., for example, the demands advanced by the weavers in
      the Moscow district in 1885 and in the St. Petersburg district
      in 1896). A compilation of such demands and needs might serve
      for years as an excellent handbook for agitators on economic

  

      questions in backward localities or among the backward strata of
      the workers. Examples of successful strikes in a given region,
      information on higher living standards, on improved working
      conditions, in one locality, would encourage the workers in
      other localities to take up the fight again and again. Fourthly,
      having made a start in generalising the trade union struggle and
      in this way strengthening the link between the Russian trade
      union movement and socialism, the Social-Democrats would at the
      same time see to it that our trade union work occupied neither
      too small nor too large a place in our Social-Democratic work as
      a whole. A local organisation that is cut off from organisations
      in other towns finds it very difficult, sometimes almost
      impossible, to maintain a correct sense of pro portion (the
      example of Rabochaya Mysl shows what a monstrous
      exaggeration can be made in the direction of trade-unionism) But
      an all-Russia organisation of revolutionaries that stands
      undeviatingly on the basis of Marxism, that leads the entire
      political struggle and possesses a staff of professional
      agitators, will never find it difficult to determine the proper
      proportion.

[6] Iskra’s 
campaign against the tares evoked the following angry outburst from
    Rabocheye Dyelo: “For Iskra, the signs of the
    times lie not so much in great events [of the spring], as in the
    miserable attempts of the agents of Zubatov to ’legalise’ the
    working-class movement. It fails to see that these facts tell
    against it; for they testify that the working-class movement has
    assumed menacing proportions in the eyes of the government”
    (Two Conferences, p. 27). For all this we have to blame
    the “dogmatism” of the orthodox who “turn a deaf ear to the
    imperative demands of life”. They obstinately refuse to see the
    yard-high wheat and are combating inch-high tares! Does this not
    reveal a “distorted sense of perspective in regard to the Russian 
working-class movement” (ibid., p. 27)?—Lenin

[8] For the
    moment let us observe merely that our remarks on “pushing on
    from outside” and Svoboda’s other disquisitions on
    organisation apply in their entirety to all the
    Economists, including the adherents of Rabocheye Dyelo;
    for some of them have actively preached and defended such views
    on organisation, while others among them have drifted into them.—Lenin

[9] This
    term is perhaps more applicable to Svoboda than the
    former, for in an article entitled “The Regeneration of
    Revolutionisin” the publication defends terrorism, while in the
    article at present under review it defends Economism. One might
    say of Svoboda that “it would if it could, but it
    can’t”. Its wishes and intentions are of the very best — but
    the result is utter confusion; this is chiefly due to the fact
    that, while Svoboda advocates continuity of
    organisation, it refuses to recognise continuity of
    revolutionary thought and Social-Democratic theory. It wants to
    revive the professional revolutionary (“The Regeneration of

 

    Revolutionism”), and to that end proposes, first, excitative
    terrorism, and, secondly, — an organisation of average workers"
    (Svoboda, No. 1, p. 66, et seq.), as less likely to be
    “pushed on from outside”. In other words, it proposes to pull
    the house down to use the timber for heating it.—Lenin

Svoboda, No. 1, p. 66, in the article “Organisation”:
    “The heavy tread of the army of workers will reinforce all the
    demands that will be advanced in behalf of Russian Labour” —
    Labour with a capital L, of course. And the author exclaims: “I
    am not in the least hostile towards the intelligentsia, but [but
    — the word that Shchedrin translated as meaning: The ears never
    grow higher than the forehead!] — but I always get frightfully
    annoyed when a man comes to me uttering beautiful and charming
    words and demands that they be accepted for their [his?]  beauty
    and other virtues” (p. 62). Yes, I always get “frightfully
    annoyed”, too.—Lenin

[14]
The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats, p. 23. (See
    Collected Works, Vol. 2, p. 342. —Ed.) Apropos, we
    shall give another illustration of the fact that
    Rabocheye Dyelo either does not understand what it is
    talking about or changes its views “with the wind”. In No. 1 of
    Rabocheye Dyelo, we find the following passage in
    italics: “The substance set forth in the pamphlet accords
    entirely with the editorial programme of ’Rabocheye Dyelo’”
    (p. 142). Really? Does the view that the overthrow of the
    autocracy must not be set as the first task of the mass
    movement accord with the views expressed in The Tasks of the
    Russian Social-Democrats? Do the theory of “the
    economic struggle against the employers and the government” and
    the stages theory accord with the views expressed in that
    pamphlet? We leave it to the reader to judge whether a
    periodical that understands the meaning of “accordance in
    opinion” in this peculiar manner can have firm principles.—Lenin

[15] See Report to the Paris
Congress,[24] p. 14. From that time
    (1897) to the spring of 1900, thirty issues of various papers
    were published in various places.... On an average, over one
    issue per month was published".—Lenin

[16] Note:  This footnote has
been moved into the body of the document.

[17]
    That is why even examples of exceptionally good local newspapers
    fully confirm our point of view. For example, Yuzhny
    Rabochy[25] is an excellent newspaper, entirely free of
    instability of principle. But it has been unable to provide what

 

    it desired for the local movement, owing to the infrequency of
    its publication and to extensive police raids. Principled
    presentation of the fundamental questions of the movement and
    wide political agitation, which our Party most urgently requires
    at the present time, has proved too big a job for the local
    newspaper. The material of particular value it has published,
    like the articles on the mine owners’ convention and on
    unemployment, was not strictly local material, it was
    required for the whole of Russia, not for the South
    alone. No such articles have appeared in any of our
    Social-Democratic newspapers.—Lenin

[18]
    Legal material is particularly important in this connection, and
    we are particularly behind in our ability to gather and utilise
    it systematically. It would not be an exaggeration to say that
    one could somehow compile a trade union pamphlet on the basis

 

    solely of legal material, but it could not be done on the basis
    of illegal material alone. In gathering illegal material from
    Workers oil questions like those dealt with in the publications
    of Rabochaya Mysl, we waste a great deal of the efforts
    of revolutionaries (whose place in this work could very easily
    be taken by legal workers), and yet we never obtain good
    material. The reason is that a worker who very often knows only
    a single department of a large factory and almost always the
    economic results, but not the general conditions and standards
    of his work, cannot acquire the knowledge which is possessed by
    the office staff of a factory, by inspectors, doctors, etc., and
    which is scattered in petty newspaper reports and in special
    industrial, medical, Zemstvo, and other publications.

    I vividly recall my “first experiment”, which I would never like
    to repeat.  I spent many weeks “examining” a worker, who would
    often visit me, regarding every aspect of the conditions
    prevailing in the enormous factory at which he was
    employed. True, after great effort, I managed to obtain material
    for a description (of the one single factory!), but at the end
    of the interview the worker would wipe the sweat from his brow,
    and say to me smilingly: ’I find it easier to work overtime than
    to answer your questions.”

    The more energetically we carry on our revolutionary struggle,
    the more the government will be compelled to legalise part of
    the “trade union” work, thereby relieving us of part of our
    burden.—Lenin

BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT



V
The “Plan” For an All-Russia
      Political Newspaper

      “The most serious blunder Iskra committed in this
      connection” writes B. Krichevsky (Rabocheye Dyelo,
      No. 10, p. 30), charging us with a tendency to “convert theory
      into a lifeless doctrine by isolating it from practice”, “was
      its ’plan’ for a general party organisation” (viz., the article
      entitled “Where To Begin”[1]).
  Martynov echoes this idea in
      declaring that “Iskra’s tendency to belittle the
      significance of the forward march of the drab everyday struggle
      in comparison with the propaganda of brilliant and completed
      ideas ... was crowned with the plan for the organisation of a
      party which it sets forth in the article entitled ’Where To
      Begin’ in issue No. 4” (ibid., p. 61). Finally, L. Nadezhdin has

  

      of late joined in the chorus of indignation against this “plan”
      (the quotation marks were meant to express sarcasm). In his
      pamphlet, which we have just received, entitled The Eve of
      the Revolution (published by the “Revolutionary-Socialist
      Group” Svoboda, whose acquaintance we have made), he
      declares (p. 126): “To speak now of an organisation held
      together by an all-Russia newspaper means propagating armchair
      ideas and armchair work” and represents a manifestation of
      “bookishness”, etc.


      That our terrorist turns out to be in agreement with the
      champions of the “forward march of the drab everyday struggle”
      is not surprising, since we have traced the roots of this
      intimacy between them in the chapters on politics and
      organisation. But must draw attention here to the fact that
      Nadezhdin is the only one who has conscientiously tried to grasp
      the train of thought in an article he disliked and has made an
      attempt to reply to the point, whereas Rabocheye Dyelo,
      has said nothing that is material to the subject, but has tried
      merely to confuse the question by a series of unseemly,
      demagogic sallies. Unpleasant though the task may be, we must
      first spend some time in cleansing this Augean stable.


A. Who Was Offended By the Article “Where To Begin”

      Let us present a small selection of the expletives and
      exclamations that Rabocheye Dyelo hurled at us. “It is
      not a newspaper that can create a party organisation, but vice
      versa....” A newspaper, standing above the party, outside of
      its control, and independent of it, thanks to its having its own
      staff of agents. “By what miracle has Iskra forgotten
      about the actually existing Social-Democratic organisations of
      the party to which it belongs?....” “Those who possess firm
      principles and a corresponding plan are the supreme regulators
      of the real struggle of the party and dictate to it their
      plan....” “The plan drives our active and virile
      organisations into the kingdom of shadows and desires to call
      into being a fantastic network of agents....” “Were
      Iskra’s plan carried into effect, every trace of the
      Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, which is taking shape,
      would be

  

  obliterated....” “A propagandist organ becomes an
      uncontrolled autocratic law-maker for the entire practical
      revolutionary struggle....” “How should our Party react to
      the suggestion that it be completely subordinated to an
      autonomous editorial board?”, etc., etc.


  As the reader can see from the contents and the tone of these
      above quotations, Rabocheye Dyelo has taken
      offence. Offence, not for its own sake, but for the sake of
      the organisations and committees of our Party which it alleges
      Iskra desires to drive into the kingdom of shadows and
      whose very traces it would obliterate. How terrible! But a
      curious thing should be noted. The article “Where To Begin”
      appeared in May 1901. The articles in Rabocheye Dyelo
  appeared in September 1901. Now we are in mid-January
      1902. During these five months (prior to and after September),
      not a single committee and not a single
  organisation of the Party protested formally against this
      monster that seeks to drive them into the kingdom of shadows;
      and yet scores and hundreds of communications from all parts of
      Russia have appeared during this period in Iskra, as
      well as in numerous local and non-local publications. How could
      it happen that those who would be driven into the realm of
      shadows are not aware of it and have not taken offence, though a
      third party has?


      The explanation is that the committees and other organisations
      are engaged in real work and are not playing at “democracy”. The
      committees read the article “Where To Begin”, saw that it
      represented an attempt “to elaborate a definite plan for an
      organisation, so that its formation may be undertaken from
      all aspects”; and since they knew and saw very well that
      not one of these “sides” would dream of “setting about
      to build it” until it was convinced of its necessity, and of the
      correctness of the architectural plan, it has naturally never
      occurred to them to take offence at the boldness of the people
      who said in Iskra: “In view of the pressing importance
      of the question we, on our part, take the liberty of submitting
      to the comrades a skeleton plan to be developed in greater
      detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for the print.” With a
      conscientious approach to the work, was it possible to view
      things otherwise than that if the comrades accepted the
      plan submitted to them, they would carry it out, not because

  

      they are “subordinate”, but because they would be convinced of
      its necessity for our common cause, and that if they did not
      accept it, then the “skeleton” (a pretentious word, is it
      not?) would remain merely a skeleton? Is it not demagogy to
      fight against the skeleton of a plan, not only by “picking it to
      pieces” and advising comrades to reject it, but by inciting
  people inexperienced in revolutionary matters against its
      authors merely on the grounds that they dare
  to “legislate” and come out as the “supreme regulators”,
      i.e., because they dare to propose an outline of a
      plan? Can our Party develop and make progress if an attempt
      to raise local functionaries to broader views, tasks,
      plans, etc., is objected to, not only with the claim that these
      views are erroneous, but on the grounds that the very “desire”
      to “raise” us gives “offence”? Nadezhdin,
      too, “picked” our plan “to pieces”, but he did not sink to such
      demagogy as cannot be explained solely by naivete or by
      primitiveness of political views. From the outset, he
      emphatically rejected the charge that we intended to establish
      an “inspectorship over the Party”. That is why Nadezhdin’s
      criticism of the plan can and should be answered on its merits,
      while Rabocheye Dyelo deserves only to be treated with
      contempt.

  But contempt for a writer who sinks so low as to shout about
      autocracy and “subordination” does not relieve us of the duty
      of disentangling the confusion that such people create in the
      minds of their readers. Here we can clearly demonstrate to the
      world the nature of catchwords like “broad democracy”. We are
      accused of forgetting the committees, of desiring or attempting
      to drive them into the kingdom of shadows, etc. How can we reply
      to these charges when, out of considerations of secrecy, we can
      give the reader almost no facts regarding our real
      relationships with the committees? Persons hurling vehement
      accusations calculated to provoke the crowd prove to be ahead of
      us because of their brazenness and their disregard of the duty
      of a revolutionary to conceal carefully from the eyes of the
      world the relationships and contacts which he maintains, which
      he is establishing or trying to establish. Naturally, we refuse
      once and for all to compete with such people in the field of
      “democratism”. As to the reader who is not initiated in all
      Party affairs, the only way in which we can discharge our duty
      to him is to acquaint him, not with what is and what is


im Werden but with a particle of what
      has taken place and what may be told as a thing of the past.

  
  The Bund hints that we are “impostors”[2]; the Union Abroad
      accuses us of attempting to obliterate all traces of the
      Party. Gentlemen, you will get complete satisfaction when we
      relate to the public four facts concerning the past.


      First fact.[3] The 
  members of one of the Leagues of Struggle, who took a 
  direct part in founding our Party and in
      sending a delegate to the Inaugural Party Congress, reached
      agreement with a member of the Iskra group regarding the
      publication of a series of books for workers that were to serve
      the entire movement. The attempt to publish the series failed  and
      the pamphlets written for it, The Tasks of the Russian
      Social-Democrats and The New Factory Law,[4] by a circuitous
      course and through the medium of third parties, found their way
      abroad, where they were published.[14]


      Second fact. Members of the Central Committee of the Bund
      approached a member of the Iskra group with the
      proposal to organise what the Bund then described as a “literary
      laboratory”. In making the proposal, they stated that unless
      this was done, the movement would greatly retrogress. The result
      of these negotiations was the appearance of the pamphlet The
      Working-Class Cause in Russia.[5]


  Third fact. The Central Committee of the Bund, via a provincial
      town, approached a member of the Iskra group with the
      proposal that he undertake the editing of the revived
      Rabochaya Gazeta and, of course, obtained his
      consent. The offer was later modified: the comrade in question
      was invited to act as a contributor, in view of a new plan for
      the composition of the Editorial Board. Also this proposal, of

  

      course, obtained his consent.[15] Articles 
  were sent (which we managed to preserve): “Our Programme” 
  which was a direct protest against Bernsteinism, against the change 
  in the line of the legal literature and of Rabochaya Mysl; 
  “Our Immediate Task” (“to publish a Party organ 
  that shall appear regularly and
      have close contacts with all the local groups”, the drawbacks of
      the prevailing “amateurism”), “An Urgent Question” (an
      examination of the objection that it is necessary first
  to develop the activities of local groups before
      undertaking the publication of a common organ; an insistence on
      the paramount importance of a “revolutionary organisation” and
      on the necessity of “developing organisation, discipline, and
      the technique of secrecy to the highest degree of
      perfection”).[6] The proposal
  to resume publication of Rabochaya Gazeta was not carried out, 
  and the articles were not published.


  Fourth fact. A member of the committee that was organising the
      second regular congress of our Party communicated to a member of
      the Iskra group the programme of the congress and
      proposed that group as editorial board of the revived
      Rabochaya Gazeta. This preliminary step, as it were,
      was later sanctioned by the committee to which this member
      belonged, and by the Central Committee of the Bund.[16] The Iskra group was 
  notified of the place and time of the
      congress and (uncertain of being able, for certain reasons, to
      send a delegate) drew up a written report for the congress. In
      the report, the idea was suggested that the mere election of a
      Central Committee would not only fail to solve the question of
      unification at a time of such complete disorder as the present,
      but would even compromise the grand idea of establishing a
      party, in the event of an early, swift, and thorough police
      round-up, which was more than likely in view of the prevailing
      lack of secrecy; that therefore, a beginning should be made by
      inviting all committees and all other organisations to support
      the revived common organ, which would establish real
      contacts between all the committees and really
      train a group of leaders for the entire movement; and that
      the committees and the Party would very easily be able to

  

      transform such a group into a Central Committee as soon as the
      group had grown and become strong. In consequence of a number of
      police raids and arrests, however, the congress could not take
      place. For security reasons the report was destroyed, having
      been read only by a few comrades, including the representatives
      of one committee.


  Let the reader now judge for himself the character of the
      methods employed by the Bund in hinting that we were impostors,
      or by Rabocheye Dyelo, which accuses us of trying to
      relegate the committees to the kingdom of shadows and to
      “substitute” for the organisation of a party an organisation
      disseminating the ideas advocated by a single newspaper. It was
      to the committees, on their repeated invitation, that
      we reported on the necessity for adopting a definite plan of
      concerted activities. It was precisely for the Party
      organisation that we elaborated this plan, in articles sent to
      Rabochaya Gazeta, and in the report to the Party
      congress, again on the invitation of those who held such an
      influential position in the Party that they took the initiative
      in its (actual) restoration. Only after the twice
      repeated attempts of the Party organisation, in
      conjunction with ourselves, officiallyto revive the
      central organ of the Party had failed, did we consider it our
      bounden duty to publish an unofficial organ, in order
      that with the third attempt the comrades might have
      before them the results of experience and not merely
      conjectural proposals. Now certain results of this experience
      are present for all to see, and all comrades may now judge
      whether we properly understood our duties and what should be
      thought of people that strive to mislead those unacquainted with
      the immediate past, simply because they are piqued at our having
      pointed out to some their inconsistency on the “national”
      question, and to others the inadmissibility of their vacillation
      in matters of principle.


B. Can A Newspaper Be A Collective Organiser?

      The quintessence of the article “Where To Begin” consists
      in the fact that it discusses precisely this question
      and gives an affirmative reply to it. As far as we know, the
      only attempt to examine this question on its merits and to prove
      that it must be answered in the negative was made by

  

      L. Nadezhdin, whose argument we reproduce in full:



      “... It pleased us greatly to see Iskra
      (No. 4) present the question of the need for an all-Russia
      newspaper; but we cannot agree that this presentation bears
      relevance to the title ’Where To Begin’. Undoubtedly this is an
      extremely important matter, but neither a newspaper, nor a
      series of popular leaflets, nor a mountain of manifestoes, can
      serve as the basis for a militant organisation in revolutionary
      times. We must set to work to build strong political
      organisations in the localities. We lack such organisations; we
      have been carrying on our work mainly among enlightened workers,
      while the masses have been engaged almost exclusively in the
      economic struggle. If strong political organisations are not
      trained locally, what significance will even an excellently
      organised all-Russia newspaper have? It will be a burning
      bush, burning without being consumed, but firing no one!
      Iskra thinks that around it and in the activities in
      its behalf people will gather and organise. But they will
      find it far easier to gather and organise around activities that
      are more concrete. This something more concrete must and
      should be the extensive organisation of local newspapers, the
      immediate preparation of the workers’ forces for demonstrations,
      the constant activity of local organisations among the
      unempIoyed (indefatigable distribution of pamphlets and
      leaflets, convening of meetings, appeals to actions of protest
      against the government, etc.). We must begin live political work
      in the localities, and when the time comes to unite on this real
      basis, it will not be an artificial, paper unity; not by means
      of newspapers can such a unification of local work into an
      all-Russia cause be achieved!” (The Eve of the Revolution,
      p. 54.)



     We have emphasised the passages in this eloquent tirade that
      most clearly show the author’s incorrect judgement of our plan,
      as well as the incorrectness of his point of view in general,
      which is here contraposed to that of Iskra. Unless we
      train strong political organisations in the localities, even an
      excellently organised all-Russia newspaper will be of no
      avail. This is incontrovertible. But the whole point is that
      there is no other way of training strong
      political organisations except through the medium of an
      all-Russia newspaper. The author missed the most important
      statement Iskra made before it proceeded to
      set forth its “plan”: that it was necessary “to call for the
      formation of a revolutionary organisation, capable of uniting
      all forces and guiding the movement in actual practice and
      not in name alone, that is, an organisation ready
      at any time to support every protest and every outbrea’ and
      use it to build up and consolidate the fighting forces suitable
      for the decisive struggle”. But now after the February and March

  

      events, everyone will agree with this in principle, continues
      Iskra. Yet what we need is not a solution of the
      question in principle, but its practical solution; we
      must immediately advance a definite constructive plan through
      which all may immediately set to work to build from every
      side. Now we are again being dragged away from the
      practical solution towards something which in principle is
      correct, indisputable, and great, but which is entirely
      inadequate and incomprehensible to the broad masses of workers,
      namely, “to rear strong political organisations”! This is not
      the point at issue, most worthy author. The point is how to go
      about the rearing and how to accomplish it.


  It is not true to say that “we have been carrying on our work
      mainly among enlightened workers, while the masses have been
      engaged almost exclusively in the economic struggle”. Presented
      in such a form, the thesis reduces itself to Svoboda’s
      usual but fundamentally false contraposition of the
      enlightened workers to the “masses”. In recent years, even the
      enlightened workers have been “engaged almost exclusively in the
      economic struggle”. That is the first point. On the other hand,
      the masses will never learn to conduct the political struggle
      until we help to train leaders for this struggle, both
      from among the enlightened workers and from among the
      intellectuals. Such leaders can acquire training solely
      by systematically evaluating all the everyday
      aspects of our political life, all attempts at protest
      and struggle on the part of the various classes and on various
      grounds. Therefore, to talk of “rearing political organisations”
      and at the same time to contrast the “paper work” of a
      political newspaper to “live political work in the localities”
      is plainly ridiculous. Iskra has adapted its “plan” for
      a newspaper to the “plan” for creating a “militant preparedness”
      to support the unemployed movement, peasant revolts, discontent
      among, the Zemstvo people, “popular indignation against some
      tsarist bashi-bazouk on the rampage”, etc. Anyone who is at all
      acquainted with the movement knows full well that the vast
      majority of local organisations have never even dreamed
      of these things; that many of the prospects of “live
      political work” here indicated have never been realised
      by a single organisation; that the attempt, for example, to call

  

  attention to the growth of discontent and protest among the
      Zemstvo intelligentsia rouses feelings of consternation and
      perplexity in Nadezhdin (“Good Lord, is this newspaper intended
      for Zemstvo people?”—The Eve, p. 129), among the
      Economists (Letter to Iskra, No. 12), and among many
      practical workers. Under these circumstances, it is possible to
      “begin” only by inducing people to think about
      all these things, to summarise and generalise all the diverse
      signs of ferment and active struggle. In our time, when
      Social-Democratic tasks are being degraded, the only way
  “live political work” can be begun is with live
      political agitation, which is impossible unless we have an
      all-Russia newspaper, frequently issued and regularly
      distributed.


      Those who regard the Iskra “plan” as a manifestation
      of “bookishness” have totally failed to understand its substance
      and take for the goal that which is suggested as the most
      suitable means for the present time. These people have not taken
      the trouble to study the two comparisons that were drawn to
      present a clear illustration of the plan. Iskra wrote:
      The publication of an all-Russia political newspaper must be
      the main line by which we may unswervingly develop,
      deepen, and expand the organisation (viz., the revolutionary
      organisation that is ever ready to support every protest and
      every outbreak). Pray tell me, when bricklayers lay bricks in,
      various parts of an enormous, unprecedentedly large structure,
      is it “paper” work to use a line to help them find the correct
      place for the bricklaying; to indicate to them the ultimate goal
      of the common work; to enable them to use, not only every brick,
      but even every piece of brick which, cemented to the bricks laid
      before and after it, forms a finished, continuous line? And are
      we not now passing through precisely such a period in our Party
      life when we have bricks and bricklayers, but lack the guide
      line for all to see and follow? Let them shout that in
      stretching out the line, we want to command. Had we desired to
      command, gentlemen, we would have written on the title page, not
      “Iskra, No. 1”, but “Rabochaya Gazeta, 
  No. 3”, as we were invited to do by certain comrades, and as we
      would have had a perfect right to do after the events
      described above. But we did not do that. We wished to have our
      hands free to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all
      pseudo-Social-Democrats; we wanted our line, if properly laid,

  

      to be respected because it was correct, and not because it had
      been laid by an official organ.


     “The question of uniting local activity in central bodies runs
      in a vicious circle,” Nadezhdin lectures us; “unification
      requires homogeneity of the elements, and the homogeneity can be
      created only by something that unites; but the unifying element
      may be the product of strong local organisations which at the
      present time are by no means distinguished for their
      homogeneity.” This truth is as revered and as irrefutable as
      that we must train strong political organisations. And it is
      equally barren. Every question “runs in a vicious
      circle” because political life as a whole is an endless chain
      consisting of an infinite number of links. The whole art of
      politics lies in finding and taking as firm a grip as we can of
      the link that is least likely to be struck from our hands, the
      one that is most important at the given moment, the one that
      most of all guarantees its possessor the possession of the whole
      chain.[7] If 
  we had a crew of experienced bricklayers who had learned to
      work so well together that they could lay their bricks exactly
      as required without a guide line (which, speaking abstractly, is
      by no means impossible), then perhaps we might take hold of some
      other link. But it is unfortunate that as yet we have no
      experienced bricklayers trained for teamwork, that bricks are
      often laid where they are not needed at all, that they are not
      laid according to the general line, but are so scattered that
      the enemy can shatter the structure as if it were made of sand
      and not of bricks.


     ’Another comparison: “A newspaper is not only a collective
      propagandist and a collective agitator, it is also a collective
      organiser. In this respect it may be compared to the
      scaffolding erected round a building under construction; it
      marks the contours of the structure and facilitates
      communication between the builders, permitting them to
      distribute the work and to view the common results achieved by
      
  

 their organised labour.“[8] Does 
 this sound anything like the
     attempt of an armchair author to exaggerate his role? The
     scaffolding is not required at all for the dwelling; it is made
     of cheaper material, is put up only temporarily, and is scrapped
     for firewood as soon as the shell of the structure is
     completed. As for the building of revolutionary organisations,
     experience shows that sometimes they may be built without
     scaffolding, as the seventies showed. But at the present time we
     cannot even imagine the possibility of erecting the building we
     require without scaffolding.


  Nadezhdin disagrees with this, saying: “Iskra thinks
      that around it and in the activities in its behalf people will
      gather and organise. But they will find it far easier
  to gather and organise around activities that are more
      concrete!” Indeed, “far easier around activities that are
      more concrete”. A Russian proverb holds: “Don’t spit into a
      well, you may want to drink from it.” But there are people who
      do not object to drinking from a well that has been spat
      into. What despicable things our magnificent, legal “Critics of
      Marxism” and illegal admirers of Rabochaya Mysl have
      said in the name of this something more concrete! How restricted
      our movement is by our own narrowness, lack of initiative, and
      hesitation, which are justified with the traditional argument
      about finding it “far easier to gather around something more
      concrete”! And Nadezhdin — who regards himself as possessing a
      particularly keen sense of the “realities of life”, who so
      severely condemns “armchair” authors and (with pretensions to
      wit) accuses Iskra of a weakness for seeing Economism
      everywhere, and who sees himself standing far above the division
      between the orthodox and the Critics — fails to see that with
      his arguments he contributes to the narrowness that arouses his
      indignation and that he is drinking from the most spat-in well!
      The sincerest indignation against narrowness, the most
      passionate desire to raise its worshippers from their knees,
      will not suffice if the indignant one is swept along without
      sail or rudder and, as “spontaneously” as the revolutionaries of
      the seventies, clutches at such things as “excitative terror”,

  

      “agrarian terror”, “sounding the tocsin etc. Let us take a
      glance at these “more concrete” activities around which he
      thinks it will be “far easier” to gather and organise: (1) local
      newspapers; (2) preparations for demonstrations; (3) work among
      the unemployed. It is immediately apparent that all these things
      have been seized upon at random as a pretext for saying
      something; for, however we may regard them, it would be absurd
      to see in them anything especially suitable for “gathering and
      organising”. The selfsame Nadezhdin says a few pages further:
      “It is time we simply stated the fact that activity of a very
      pitiable kind is being carried on in the localities, the
      committees are not doing a tenth of what they could do ... the
      coordinating centres we have at present are the purest fiction,
      representing a sort of revolutionary bureaucracy, whose members
      mutually grant generalships to one another; and so it will
      continue until strong local organisations grow up.” These
      remarks, though exaggerating the position somewhat, no doubt
      contain many a bitter truth; but can it be said that Nadezhdin
      does not perceive the connection between the pitiable activity
      in the localities and the narrow mental outlook of the
      functionaries, the narrow scope of their activities, inevitable
      in the circumstances of the lack of training of Party workers
      confined to local organisations? Has he, like the author of the
      article on organisation, published in Svoboda,
      forgotten how the transition to a broad local press (from
      1898) was accompanied by a strong intensification of Economism
      and “primitiveness”? Even if a “broad local press” could be
      established at all satisfactorily (and we have shown this to be
      impossible, save in very, exceptional cases) — even then the
      local organs could not “gather and organise” all the
      revolutionary forces for a general attack upon the
      autocracy and for leadership of the united
      struggle. Let us not forget that we are here discussing
      only the “rallying”, organising significance of the
      newspaper, and we could put to Nadezhdin, who defends
      fragmentation, the question he himself has ironically put: “Have
      we been left a legacy of 200,000 revolutionary organisers?”
      Furthermore, “preparations for demonstrations” cannot be
      contraposed to Iskra’s plan, for the very
      reason that this plan includes the organisation of the broadest
      possible demonstrations as one of its aims; the point
      under discussion is the selection of the practical


means. On this point also Nadezhdin is confused, for he
      has lost sight of the fact that only forces that are “gathered
      and organised” can “prepare for” demonstrations (which hitherto,
      in the overwhelming majority of cases, have taken place
      spontaneously) and that we lack precisely the
      ability to rally and organise. “Work among the unemployed.”
      Again the same confusion; for this too represents one of the
      field operations of the mobilised forces and not a plan for
      mobilising the forces. The extent to which Nadezhdin here too
      underestimates the harm caused by our fragmentation, by our lack
      of “200,000 organisers”, can be seen from the fact that: many
      people (including Nadezhdin) have reproached Iskra for
      the paucity of the news it gives on unemployment and for the
      casual nature of the correspondence it publishes about the most
      common affairs of rural life. The reproach is justified; but
      Iskra is “guilty without sin”. We strive “to stretch a
      line” through the countryside too, where there are hardly any
      bricklayers anywhere, and we are obliged to encourage
      everyone who informs us even as regards the most common
      facts, in the hope that this will increase the number of our
      contributors in the given field and will ultimately train us
      all to select facts that are really the most
      outstanding. But the material on which we can train is so scanty
      that, unless we generalise it for the whole of Russia, we shall
      have very little to train on at all. No doubt, one with at least
      as much ability as an agitator and as much knowledge of the life
      of the vagrant as Nadezhdin manifests could render priceless
      service to the movement by carrying on agitation among the
      unemployed; but such a person would be simply hiding his light
      under a bushel if he failed to inform all comrades in Russia as
      regards every step he took in his work, so that others, who, in
      the mass, still lack the ability to undertake new kinds of work,
      might learn from his example.


      All without exception now talk of the importance of unity, of
      the necessity for “gathering and organising”; but in the
      majority of cases what is lacking is a definite idea of where to
      begin and how to bring about this unity. Probably all will agree
      that if we “unite”, say, the district circles in a given town,
      it will be necessary to have for this purpose common
      institutions, i.e., not merely the common title of “League”, but

  

      genuinely common work, exchange of material, experience, and
      forces, distribution of functions, not only by districts, but
      through specialisation on a town-wide scale. All will agree that
      a big secret apparatus will not pay its way (to use a commercial
      expression) “with the resources” (in both money and manpower, of
      course) of a single district, and that this narrow field will
      not provide sufficient scope for a specialist to develop his
      talents. But the same thing applies to the co-ordination of
      activities of a number of towns, since even a specific locality
      will be and, in the history of our Social-Democratic movement,
      has proved to be, far too narrow a field; we have demonstrated
      this above in detail with regard to political agitation and
      organisational work. What we require foremost and imperatively
      is to broaden the field, establish real contacts between the
      towns on the basis of regular, common work; for fragmentation
      weighs down on the people and they are “stuck in a hole” (to use
      the expression employed by a correspondent to Iskra),
      not knowing what is happening in the world, from whom to learn,
      or how to acquire experience and satisfy their desire to engage
      in broad activities. I continue to insist that we can start
      establishing real contacts only with the aid of a common
      newspaper, as the only regular, all-Russia enterprise, one which
      will summarise the results of the most diverse forms of activity
      and thereby stimulate people to march forward untiringly along
      all the innumerable paths leading to revolution, in the same way
      as all roads lead to Rome. If we do not want unity in name only,
      we must arrange for all local study circles immediately to
      assign, say, a fourth of their forces to active work for the
      common cause, and the newspaper will immediately convey to
  them[9]
[9]
A reservation: that is, if a given study circle sympathises
  with the policy of the newspaper and considers it useful to
      become a collaborator, meaning by that, not only for literary
      collaboration, but for revolutionary collaboration
      generally. Note for Rabocheye Dyelo: Among
      revolutionaries who attach value to the cause and not to playing
      at democracy, who do not separate “sympathy” from the most
      active and lively participation, this reservation is taken for
      granted.—Lenin


  the general design, scope, and character of the cause; it will give
      them a precise indication of the most keenly felt shortcomings
      in the all-Russia activity, where agitation is lacking and
      contacts are weak, and it will point out which little wheels in
      the vast general mechanism a given study circle might repair or

  

      replace with better ones. A study circle that has not yet begun
      to work, but which is only just seeking activity, could then
      start, not like a craftsman in an isolated little workshop
      unaware of the earlier development in “industry” or of the
      general level of production methods prevailing in industry, but
      as a participant in an extensive enterprise that reflects the
      whole general revolutionary attack on the autocracy. The more
      perfect the finish of each little wheel and the larger the
      number of detail workers engaged in the common cause, the closer
      will our network become and the less will be the disorder in the
      ranks consequent on inevitable police, raids.


  The mere function of distributing a newspaper would help to
      establish actual contacts (if it is a newspaper worthy of the
      name, i.e., if it is issued regularly, not once a month like a
      magazine, but at least four times a month). At the present time,
      communication between towns on revolutionary business is an
      extreme rarity, and, at all events, is the exception rather than
      the rule. If we had a newspaper, however, such communication
      would become the rule and would secure, not only the
      distribution of the newspaper, of course, but (what is more
      important) an exchange of experience, of material, of forces,
      and of resources. Organisational work would immediately acquire
      much greater scope, and the success of one locality would serve
      as a standing encouragement to further perfection; it would
      arouse the desire to utilise the experience gained by comrades
      working in other parts of the country. Local work would become
      far richer and more varied than it is at present. Political and
      economic exposures gathered from all over Russia would provide
      mental food for workers of all trades and all stages of
      development; they would provide material and occasion
      for talks and readings on the most diverse subjects, which
      would, in addition, be suggested by hints in the legal press, by
      talk among the people, and by “shamefaced” government
      statements. Every outbreak, every demonstration, would be
      weighed and, discussed in its every aspect in all parts of
      Russia and would thus stimulate a desire to keep up with, and
      even surpass, the others (we socialists do not by any means
      flatly reject all emulation or all “competition”!) and
      consciously prepare that which at first, as it were, sprang up
      spontaneously,

  

  a desire to take advantage of the favourable
      conditions in a given district or at a given moment for
      modifying the plan of attack, etc. At the same time, this
      revival of local work would obviate that desperate, “convulsive”
      exertion of all efforts and risking of all forces which
      every single demonstration or the publication of every single
      issue of a local newspaper now frequently entails. On the one
      hand, the police would find it much more difficult to get at the
      “roots”, if they did not know in what district to dig down for
      them. On the other hand, regular common work would train our
      people to adjust the force of a given attack to the
      strength of the given contingent of the common army (at the
      present time hardly anyone ever thinks of doing that, because in
      nine cases out of ten these attacks occur spontaneously); such
      regular common work would facilitate the “transportation” from
      one place to another, not only of literature, but also of
      revolutionary forces.


  In a great many cases these forces are now being bled white on
      restricted local work, but under the circumstances we are
      discussing it would be possible to transfer a capable agitator
      or organiser from one end of the country to the other, and the
      occasion for doing this would constantly arise. Beginning with
      short journeys on Party business at the Party’s expense, the
      comrades would become accustomed to being maintained by the
      Party, to becoming professional revolutionaries, and to training
      themselves as real political leaders.


  And if indeed we succeeded in reaching the point when all, or
      at least a considerable majority, of the local committees local
      groups, and study circles took up active work for the common
      cause, we could, in the not distant future, establish a weekly
      newspaper for regular distribution in tens of thousands of
      copies throughout Russia. This newspaper would become part of an
      enormous pair of smith’s bellows that would fan every spark of
      the class struggle and of popular indignation into a general
      conflagration. Around what is in itself still a very innocuous
      and very small, but regular and common, effort, in the
      full sense of the word, a regular army of tried fighters would
      systematically gather and receive their training. On the ladders
      and scaffolding of this general organisational structure there
      would soon develop and come to the fore Social-Democratic

  

      Zhelyabovs from among our revolutionaries and Russian Bebels
      from among our workers, who would take their place at the head
      of the mobilised army and rouse the whole people to settle
      accounts with the shame and the curse of Russia.


  That is what we should dream of!

 *     *  * 

     “We should dream!” I wrote these words and became alarmed. I
      imagined myself sitting at a “unity conference” and opposite me
      were the Rabocheye Dyelo editors and
      contributors. Comrade Martynov rises and, turning to me, says
      sternly: “Permit me to ask you, has an autonomous editorial
      board the right to dream without first soliciting the opinion of
      the Party committees?” He is followed by Comrade Krichevsky; who
      (philosophically deepening Comrade Martynov, who long ago
      rendered Comrade Plekhanov more profound) continues even more
      sternly: “I go further. I ask, has a Marxist any right at all to
      dream, knowing that according to Marx, mankind always sets
      itself the tasks it can solve and that tactics is a process of
      the growth of Party tasks which grow together with the
      Party?”


     The very thought of these stern questions sends a cold shiver
      down my spine and makes me wish for nothing but a place to hide
      in. I shall try to hide behind the back of Pisarev.


  “There are rifts and rifts,” wrote Pisarev of the rift between
      dreams and reality. “My dream may run ahead of the natural march
      of events or may fly off at a tangent in a direction in which no
      natural march of events will ever proceed. In the first case my
      dream will not cause any harm; it may even support and augment
      the energy of the working men.... There is nothing in such
      dreams that would distort or paralyse labour-power. On the
      contrary, if man were completely deprived of the ability to
      dream in this way, if he could not from time to time run ahead
      and mentally conceive, in an entire and completed picture, the
      product to which his hands are only just beginning to lend
      shape, then I cannot at all imagine what stimulus there would be
      to induce man to undertake and complete extensive and strenuous
      work in the sphere of art, science, and practical

  

      endeavour.... The rift between dreams and reality causes no harm
      if only the person dreaming believes seriously in his dream, if
      he attentively observes life, compares his observations with his
      castles in the air, and if, generally speaking, he works
      conscientiously for the achievement of his fantasies. If there
      is some connection between dreams and life then all is

      well.”[17]


  Of this kind of dreaming there is unfortunately too little in
      our movement. And the people most responsible for this are those
      who boast of their sober views, their “closeness” to the
      “concrete”, the representatives of legal criticism and of illegal
      “tail-ism”.


C. What Type of Organisation Do We Require?

  From what has been said the reader will see that our
      “tactics-as-plan” consists in rejecting an immediate
      call for assault; in demanding “to lay effective siege
      to the enemy fortress”; or, in other words, in demanding that
      all efforts be directed towards gathering, organising, and
      mobilising a permanent army. When we ridiculed
      Rabocheye Dyelo for its leap from Economism to shouting
      for an assault (for which it clamoured in April 1901,
  in “Listok” Rabochego Dyela, 157 No. 6) it of
      course came down on us with accusations of being “doctrinaire”,
      of failing to understand our revolutionary duty, of calling for
      caution, etc. Of course, we were not in the least surprised to
      hear these accusations from those who totally lack principles
      and who evade all arguments by references to a profound
      “tactics-as-process”, any more than we were surprised by the
      fact that these charges were repeated by Nadezhdin, who in
      general has a supreme contempt for durable programmes and the
      fundamentals of tactics.


     It is said that history does not repeat itself. But Nadezhdin
      exerts every effort to cause it to repeat itself and he
      zealously imitates Tkachov[18] in 
  strongly condemning “revolutionary
      culturism”, in shouting about “sounding the tocsin” and about a
      special “ eve-of-the-revolution point of view”, etc.,
      Apparently, he has forgotten the well-known maxim that while an
      original historical event represents a tragedy, its replica is
      merely a farce.[19] The attempt to 
  seize power, which was prepared by the preaching of Tkachov and carried

  

  out by means of the “terrifying” terror that did really 
  terrify, had grandeur, but
      the “excitative” terror of a Tkachov the Little is simply
      ludicrous, particularly so when it is supplemented with the idea
      of an organisation of average people.


“If Iskra would only emerge from its sphere of
    bookishness,” wrote Nadezhdin, “it would realise that these
    (instances like the worker’s letter to Iskra, No. 7,
    etc.) are symptoms of the fact that soon, very soon, the
    ’assault’ will begin, and to speak now [sic!] of an organisation
    linked with an all-Russia newspaper means to propagate armchair
    ideas and armchair activity.”  What an unimaginable muddle — on
    the one hand, excitative terror and an “organisation of average
    people”, along with the opinion that it is far “easier” to gather
    around something “more concrete”, like a local newspaper, and, on
    the other, the view that to talk “now” about an all-Russia
    organisation means to propagate armchair thoughts, or, bluntly
    put, “now” it is already too late! But what of the “extensive
    organisation of local newspapers” — is it not too late for that,
    my dear L. Nadezhdin? And compare with this Iskra’s point
    of view and tactical line: excitative terror is nonsense; to talk
    of an organisation of average people and of the extensive
    publication of local newspapers means to fling the door wide
    open to Economism. We must speak of a single all-Russia
    organisation of revolutionaries, and it will never be too
    late to talk of that until the real, not a paper, assault
    begins.



“Yes, as far as organisation is concerned the
    situation is anything but brilliant,” continues Nadezhdin. “Yes,
    Iskra is entirely right in saying that the mass of our
    fighting forces consists of volunteers and insurgents.... You do
    well to give such a sober picture of the state of our forces. But
    why, at the same time, do you forget that the masses are not
    ours at all, and consequently, will not ask us when
    to begin military operations; they will simply go and
    ’rebel’.... When the crowd itself breaks out with its elemental
    destructive force it may overwhelm and sweep aside the
    ’regular troops’ among whom we prepared all the time to introduce
    extremely systematic organisation, but never managed to
    do so.” (Our italics.)



Astounding logic! For the very reason that the “masses
    are not ours” it is stupid and unseemly to shout about an
    immediate “assault”, for assault means attack by regular troops
    and not a spontaneous mass upsurge. For the very reason that the
    masses may overwhelm and sweep aside the regular troops

  

    we must without fail “manage to keep up” with the spontaneous
    upsurge by our work of “introducing extremely systematic
    organisation” in the regular troops, for the more we “manage” to
    introduce such organisation the more probably will the regular
    troops not be overwhelmed by the masses, but will take their place
    at their head. Nadezhdin is confused because he imagines that
    troops in the course of systematic organisation are engaged in
    something that isolates them from the masses, when in actuality
    they are engaged exclusively in all-sided and all-embracing
    political. agitation, i.e., precisely in work that brings
    closer and merges into a single whole the elemental
    destructive force of the masses and the conscious destructive
    force of the organisation of revolutionaries. You, gentlemen, wish
    to lay the blame where it does not belong. For it is precisely the
    Svoboda group that, by including terror in its
    programme, calls for an organisation of terrorists, and
    such an organisation would indeed prevent our troops from
    establishing closer contacts with the masses, which,
    unfortunately, are still not ours, and which, unfortunately, do
    not yet ask us, or rarely ask us, when and how to launch their
    military operations.


“We shall miss the revolution itself,” continues Nadezhdin in
    his attempt to scare Iskra, “in the same way as we missed
    ..the recent events, which came upon us like a bolt from the
    blue.” This sentence, taken in connection with what has been
    quoted above, clearly demonstrates the absurdity of the
    “eve-of-therevolution point of view” invented by 
Svoboda.[10] Plainly
put, this special “point of view” boils down to this
    that it is too late “now” to discuss and prepare. If that is the
    case, most worthy opponent of “bookishness”, what was the use of
    writing a pamphlet of 132 pages on questions of theory[11]
[11]
      In his Review of Questions of Theory, Nadezhdin, by the
      way, made almost no contribution whatever to the discussion of
      questions of theory, apart, perhaps, from the following passage,
      a most peculiar one from the “eve-of-the-revolution point of
      view”: “Bernsteinism, on the whole, is losing its acuteness for
      us at the present moment, as is the question whether
      Mr. Adamovich will prove that Mr. Struve has already earned a
      lacing, or, on the contrary, whether Mr. Struve will refute
      Mr. Adamovich and will refuse to resign — it really makes no
      difference, because the hour of revolution has struck”
      (p. 110). One can hardly imagine a more glaring illustration of
      Nadezhdin’s infinite disregard for theory. We have proclaimed

 

      “the eve of the revolution”, therefore “it 
  really makes no difference” whether or not the orthodox will succeed in
      finally driving the Critics from their positions! Our wiseacre
      fails to see that it is precisely during the revolution that we
      shall stand in need of the results of our theoretical battles
      with the Critics in order to be able resolutely to combat their
      practical positions!—Lenin

  

and tactics”?  Don’t you think it would have been more becoming for
    the  “eve-of-the-revolution point of view” to have issued
    132,000 leaflets containing the summary call, “Bang them
    — knock’em down!”?


Those who make nation-wide political agitation the cornerstone
    of their programme, their tactics, and their organisational
    work, as Iskra does, stand the least risk of missing
    the revolution. The people who are now engaged throughout Russia
    in weaving the network of connections that spread from the
    all-Russia newspaper not only did not miss the spring events, but,
    on the contrary, gave us an opportunity to foretell them.  Nor did
    they miss the demonstrations that were described in Iskra,
    Nos. 13 and 14; on the contrary, they took part in
    them, clearly realising that it was their duty to come to the aid
    of the spontaneously rising masses and, at the same time, through
    the medium of the newspaper, help all the comrades in Russia to
    inform themselves of the demonstrations and to make use of their
    gathered experience. And if they live they will not miss
    the revolution, which, first and foremost, will demand of us
    experience in agitation, ability to support (in a
    Social-Democratic manner) every protest, as well as direct the
    spontaneous movement, while safeguarding it from the mistakes of
    friends and the traps of enemies.


We have thus come to the last reason that compels us so
    strongly to insist on the plan of an organisation centred round an
    all-Russia newspaper, through the common work for the common
    newspaper. Only such organisation will ensure the flexibility
    required of a militant Social-Democratic organisation, viz.,
    the ability to adapt itself immediately to the most diverse and
    rapidly changing conditions of struggle, the ability, “on the one
    hand, to avoid an open battle against an overwhelming enemy, when
    the enemy has concentrated all his forces at one spot and yet, on
    the other, to take advantage of his unwieldiness and to attack him

  

    when and where he least expects it”.[12] It would be a grievous error indeed
    to build the Party organisation in anticipation only of outbreaks
    and street fighting, or only upon the “forward march of the drab
    everyday struggle”. We must always conduct our everyday
    work and always be prepared for every situation, because very
    frequently it is almost impossible to foresee when a period of
    outbreak will give way to a period of calm. In the instances,
    however, when it is possible to do so, we could not turn this
    foresight to account for the purpose of reconstructing our
    organisation; for in an autocratic country these changes take
    place with astonishing rapidity, being sometimes connected with a
    single night raid by the tsarist janizaries.[20] And 
the revolution itself must not by any means be regarded as a single act 
(as the Nadezhdins apparently imagine), but as a series of more or less
    powerful outbreaks rapidly alternating with periods of more or
    less complete calm. For that reason, the principal content of the
    activity of our Party organisation, the focus of this activity,
    should be work that is both possible and essential in the period
    of a most powerful outbreak as well as in the period of complete
    calm, namely, work of political agitation, connected throughout
    Russia, illuminating all aspects of life, and conducted among the
    broadest possible strata of the masses. But this work is
    unthinkable in present-day Russia without an all-Russia
    newspaper, issued very frequently. The organisation, which will
    form round this newspaper, the organisation of its
    collaborators (in the broad sense of the word, i.e., all
    those working for it), will be ready for

everything, from
    upholding the honour, the prestige, and the continuity of the
    Party in periods of acute revolutionary “depression” to preparing
    for, appointing the time for, and carrying out the nation-wide
    armed uprising.


Indeed, picture to yourselves a very ordinary occurrence in
    Russia-the total round-up of our comrades in one or several
    localities. In the absence of a single, common, regular
    activity that combines all the local organisations, such round-ups
    frequently result in the interruption of the work for many
    months. If, however, all the local organisations had one common
    activity, then, even in the event of a very serious round-up, two
    or three energetic persons could in the course of a few weeks
    establish contact between the common centre and new youth circles,
    which, as we know, spring up very quickly even now. And when the
    common activity, hampered by the arrests, is apparent to all, new
    circles will be able to come into being and make connections with
    the centre even more rapidly.


On the other hand, picture to yourselves a popular
    uprising. Probably everyone will now agree that we must think of
    this and prepare for it. But how? Surely the Central Committee
    cannot appoint agents to all localities for the purpose of
    preparing the uprising. Even if we had a Central Committee, it
    could achieve absolutely nothing by such appointments under
    present-day Russian conditions. But a network of agents[13] that
    would form in the course of establishing and distributing the
    common newspaper would not have to “sit about and wait” for the
    call for an uprising, but could carry on the regular activity that
    would guarantee the highest probability of success in the event of

  

    an uprising. Such activity would strengthen our contacts with the
    broadest strata of the working masses and with all social strata
    that are discontented with the autocracy, which is of such
    importance for an uprising. Precisely such activity would serve to
    cultivate the ability to estimate correctly the general political
    situation and, consequently, the ability to select the proper
    moment for an uprising. Precisely such activity would train all
    local organisations to respond simultaneously to the same
    political questions, incidents, and events that agitate the whole
    of Russia and to react to such “incidents” in the most vigorous,
    uniform, and expedient manner possible; for an uprising is in
    essence the most vigorous, most uniform, and most expedient
    “answer” of the entire people to the government. Lastly, it is
    precisely such activity that would train all revolutionary
    organisations throughout Russia to maintain the most continuous,
    and at the same time the most secret, contacts with one another,
    thus creating real Party unity; for without such contacts
    it will be impossible collectively to discuss’ the plan for the
    uprising and to take the necessary preparatory measures on the
    eve, measures that must be kept in the strictest secrecy.


In a word, the “plan for an all-Russia political newspaper”,
    far from representing the fruits of the labour of armchair
    workers, infected with dogmatism and bookishness (as it seemed to
    those who gave but little thought to it), is the most practical
    plan for immediate and all-round preparation of the uprising,
    with, at the same time, no loss of sight for a moment of the
    pressing day-to-day work.

    at once. Here you have a ready-made topic for two leading
    articles for No. 12 of Rabocheye Dyelo!—Lenin

    Martynov, in quoting the first sentence of this passage in
    Rabocheye Dyelo (No. 10, p. 62), omitted the second, as

    culturists, who do not accept the eve-of-the-revolution point of
    view, are not in the least perturbed by the prospect of working
    for a long period of time,” writes Nadezhdin (p. 62). This
    brings us to observe: Unless we are able to devise political
    tactics and an organisational plan for work over a very long
    period, while ensuring, in the very process of this
    work, our Party’s readiness to be at its post and fulfil
    its duty in every contingency whenever the march of events is
    accelerated — unless we succeed in doing this, we shall prove
    to he but miserable political adventurers. Only Nadezhdin, who
    began but yesterday to describe himself as a Social-Democrat,
    can forget that the aim of Social-Democracy is to transform
    radically the conditions of life of the whole of mankind and
    that for this reason it is not permissible for a Social-Democrat to be 
“perturbed” by the question of the duration of the work.—Lenin

[13] 
    Alas, alas! Again I have let slip that awful word “agents”,
    which jars so much on the democratic cars of the Martynovs! I
    wonder why this word did not offend the heroes of the seventies
    and yet off ends the amateurs of the nineties? I like the word,
    because it clearly and trenchantly indicates the common
    cause to which all the agents bend their thoughts and
    actions, and if I had to replace this word by another, the only
    word I might select would be the word “collaborator”, if it did
    not suggest a certain bookishness and vagueness. The thing we
    need is a military organisation of agents. However, the numerous
    Martynovs (particularly abroad), whose favourite pastime is
    “mutual grants of generalships to one another”, may instead of
    saying “passport agent” prefer to say, “Chief of the Special
    Department for Supplying Revolutionaries with
    Passports”. etc.—Lenin

      convene the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in the spring of 1900. The
      “member of the committee” referred to was I. H. Lalayants (a

      Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all facts

## Conclusion





Lenin's What Is To Be Done?: Conclusion








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
What Is To Be Done?
BURNING QUESTIONS of our MOVEMENT



•
Conclusion
The history of Russian Social-Democracy can be distinctly
    divided into three periods:
The first period embraces about ten years, approximately from
    1884 to 1894. This was the period of the rise and consolidation of
    the theory and programme of Social-Democracy. The adherents of the
    new trend in Russia were very few in number. Social-Democracy
    existed without a working-class movement, and as a political party
    it was at the embryonic stage of development.
The second period embraces three or four years—1894-98, In
    this period Social-Democracy appeared on the scene as a social
    movement, as the upsurge of the masses of the people, as a
    political party. This is the period of its childhood and
    adolescence. The intelligentsia was fired with a vast and general
    zeal for struggle against Narodism and for going among the
    workers; the workers displayed a general enthusiasm for strike
    action. The movement made enormous strides. The majority of the
    leaders were young people who had not reached “the age of
    thirty-five” which to Mr. N. Mikhailovsky appeared to be a sort of
    natural border-line. Owing to their youth, they proved to be
    untrained for practical work and they left the scene with
    astonishing rapidity. But in the majority of cases the scope of
    their activity was very wide. Many of them had begun their
    revolutionary thinking as adherents of Narodnaya Volya. Nearly all
    had in their early youth enthusiastically worshipped the terrorist
    heroes. It required a struggle to abandon the captivating
    impressions of those heroic traditions, and the struggle was
    accompanied by the breaking off of personal relations with people
    who were determined

   

to remain loyal to the Narodnaya Volya and for
    whom the young Social-Democrats had profound respect. The struggle
    compelled the youthful leaders to educate themselves to read
    illegal literature of every trend, and to study closely the
    questions of legal Narodism. Trained in this struggle,
    Social-Democrats went into the working-class movement without “for
    a moment” forgetting either the theory of Marxism, which brightly
    illumined their path, or the task of overthrowing the
    autocracy. The formation of the Party in the spring of 1898 was
    the most striking and at the same time the last act of the
    Social-Democrats of this period.
The third period, as we have seen, was prepared in 1897 and it
    definitely cut off the second period in 1898 (1898-?). This was a
    period of disunity, dissolution, and vacillation. During
    adolescence a youth’s voice breaks. And so, in this period, the
    voice of Russian Social-Democracy began to break, to strike a
    false note — on the one hand, in the writings of Messrs. Struve
    and Prokopovich, of Bulgakov and Berdyaev, and on the other, in
    those of V. l-n and R. M., of B. Krichevsky and Martynov. But it
    was only the leaders who wandered about separately and drew back;
    the movement itself continued to grow, and it advanced with
    enormous strides. The proletarian struggle spread to new strata of
    the workers and extended to the whole of Russia, at the same time
    indirectly stimulating the revival of the democratic spirit among
    the students and among other sections of the population. The
    political consciousness of the leaders, however, capitulated
    before the breadth and power of the spontaneous upsurge; among the
    Social-Democrats, another type had become dominant — the type of
    functionaries, trained almost exclusively on “legal Marxist”
    literature, which proved to be all the more inadequate the more
    the spontaneity of the masses demanded political consciousness on
    the part of the leaders. The leaders not only lagged behind in
    regard to theory (“freedom of criticism”) and practice
    (“primitiveness”), but they sought to justify their backwardness
    by all manner of high-flown arguments. Social-Democracy was
    degraded to the level of trade-unionism by the Brentano adherents
    in legal literature, and by the tail-enders in illegal
    literature. The Credo programme began to be put into
    operation, especially

  

when the “primitive methods” of the
    Social-Democrats caused a revival of revolutionary non-Social-Democratic 
tendencies.
If the reader should feel critical that I have dealt at too
    great length with a certain Rabocheye Dyelo, I can say
only that Rabocheye Dyelo acquired
    “historical” significance because it most notably reflected the
    “spirit” of this third period.[1]

    It was not the consistent R. M., but
    the weathercock Krichevskys and Martynovs who were able properly
    to express the disunity and vacillation, the readiness to make
    concessions to “criticism” to “Economism”, and to 
terrorism. Not the lofty contempt for practical work displayed by some 
worshipper of the “absolute” is characteristic of this period, 
but the combination of pettifogging practice and utter disregard for
    theory. It was not so much in the direct rejection of “grandiose
    phrases” that the heroes of this period engaged as in their
    vulgarisation. Scientific socialism ceased to be an integral
    revolutionary theory and became a hodgepodge “freely” diluted with
    the content of every new German textbook that appeared; the slogan
    “class struggle” did not impel to broader and more energetic
    activity but served as a balm, since “the economic struggle is
    inseparably linked with the political struggle”; the idea of a
    party did not serve as a call for the creation of a militant
    organisation of revolutionaries, but was used to justify some sort
    of “revolutionary bureaucracy” and infantile playing at
    “democratic” forms.
When the third period will come to an end and the fourth (now
    heralded by many portents) will begin we do not know. We are
    passing from the sphere of history to the sphere of the present
    and, partly, of the future. But we firmly believe that the fourth
    period will lead to the consolidation of militant Marxism, that
    Russian Social-Democracy will emerge from the crisis in the full
    flower of manhood, that the opportunist

   

rearguard will be “replaced” by the genuine vanguard of the most
revolutionary class.
In the sense of calling for such a “replacement” and by way of
    summing up what has been expounded above, we may meet the
    question, What is to be done? with the brief reply:
Put an End to the Third Period.
 



 
Notes
 

[1]
I could also reply with the German proverb: Den Sack schlÃ¤gt man,
    den Esel meint man (you beat the sack, but you mean the
    donkey). Not Rabocheye Dyelo alone, but also the
    broad mass of practical workers and theoreticians
    was carried away by the “criticism” a la mode, becoming
    confused in regard to the question of spontaneity and lapsing
    from the Social-Democratic to the trade-unionist conception of
    our political and organisational tasks.
    —Lenin

Correction to What Is
    To Be Done?

    The Initiators’ Group of whom I speak in the pamphlet What
    Is To Be Done?p. 141,[1]
have asked me to make the following correction
    to my description of the part they played in the attempt to
    reconcile the Social-Democratic organisations abroad: “Of the
    three members of this group, only one left the Union Abroad at the
    end of 1900; the others left in 1901, only after becoming
    convinced that it was impossible to obtain the Union’s consent to
    a conference with the Iskra organisation abroad and the
    revolutionary Sotsial-Demokrat organisation, which the
    Initiators’ Group had proposed. The Administrative Committee of
    the Union Abroad at first rejected this proposal, contending that
    the persons comprising the Initiators’ Group were ‘not competent’
    to act as mediators, and it expressed the desire to enter into
    direct contact with the Iskra organisation abroad. Soon
    thereafter, however, the Administrative Committee of the Union
    Abroad informed the Initiators’ Group that following the
    appearance of the first number of Iskra containing the
    report of the split in the Union, it had altered its decision and
    no longer desired to maintain relations with Iskra. After
    this, how can one explain the statement made by a member of the
    Administrative Committee of the Union Abroad that the latter’s
    rejection of a conference was called forth entirely by
    its dissatisfaction with the composition of the Initiators’ Group?
    It is true that it is equally difficult to explain why the

   

Administrative Committee of the Union Abroad agreed to a
    conference in June of last year, still remained in force and
    Iskra’s ‘negative’ attitude to the Union Abroad was still
    more strongly expressed in the first issue of Zarya, and
    in No. 4 of Iskra, both of which appeared prior to the
    June Conference.”
