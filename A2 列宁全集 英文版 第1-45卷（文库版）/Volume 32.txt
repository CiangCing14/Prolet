Comrades, I must first of all apologise for
    departing from the rules of procedure, for anyone wishing to take
    part in the debate should have heard the report, the second report
    and the speeches. I am so unwell, unfortunately, that I have been
    unable to do this. But I was able yesterday to read the principal
    printed documents and to prepare my remarks. This departure from
    the rules will naturally cause you some inconvenience; not having
    heard the other speeches, I may go over old ground and leave out
    what should be dealt with. But I had no choice.
My principal material is Comrade Trotsky ’s pamphlet,
    The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions. When I compare it
    with the theses he submitted to the Central Committee, and go over
    it very carefully, I am amazed at the number of theoretical
    mistakes and glaring blunders it contains. How could anyone
    starting a big Party discussion on this question produce such a
    sorry excuse for a carefully thought out statement? Let me go over
    the main points which, I think, contain the original fundamental
    theoretical errors.
Trade unions are not just historically necessary; they are
    historically inevitable as an organisation of the industrial
    proletariat, and, under the dictatorship of the proletariat,
    embrace nearly the whole of it. This is basic, but Comrade Trotsky
    keeps forgetting it; he neither appreciates it nor makes it his
    point of departure, all this while dealing With “The Role
    and Tasks of the Trade Unions”, a subject of infinite
    compass.
 It follows from what I have said that the trade unions have an
    extremely important part to play at every step of the dictatorship
    of the proletariat. But what is their part? I find that it is a
    most unusual one, as soon as I delve into this question, which is
    one of the most fundamental theoretically. On the one hand, the
    trade unions, which take in all industrial workers, are an
    organisation of the ruling, dominant, governing class, which has
    now set up a dictatorship and is exercising coercion through the
    state. But it is not a state organisation; nor is it one designed
    for coercion, but for education. It is an organisation designed to
    draw in and to train; it is, in fact, a school: a school of
    administration, a school of economic management, a school of
    communism. It is a very unusual type of school, because there are
    no teachers or pupils; this is an extremely unusual combination of
    what has necessarily come down to us from capitalism, and what
    comes from the ranks of the advanced revolutionary detachments,
    which you might call the revolutionary vanguard of the
    proletariat. To talk about the role of the trade unions without
    taking these truths into account is to fall straight into a number
    of errors.
Within the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the
    trade unions stand, if I may say so, between the Party and the
    government. In the transition to socialism the dictatorship of the
    proletariat is inevitable, but it is not exercised by an
    organisation which takes in all industrial workers. Why not? The
    answer is given in the theses of the Second Congress of the
    Communist International on the role of political parties in
    general. I will not go into this here. What happens is that the
    Party, shall we say, absorbs the vanguard of the proletariat, and
    this vanguard exercises the dictatorship of the proletariat. The
    dictatorship cannot be exercised or the functions of government
    performed without a foundation such as the trade unions. These
    functions, however, have to be performed through the medium of
    special institutions which are also of a new type, namely, the
    Soviets. What are the practical conclusions to be drawn from this
    peculiar situation? They are, on the one hand, that the trade
    unions are a link between the vanguard and the masses, and by
    their daily work bring conviction to the masses, the masses of the
    class which alone is capable of taking us from capitalism to
    communism. On the other hand, the trade unions are a
    “reservoir” of the state power. This is what the trade
    unions are in the period of transition from capitalism to
    communism. In general, this transition cannot be achieved without
    the leadership of that class which is the only class capitalism
    has trained for large-scale production and which alone is divorced
    from the interests of the petty proprietor. But the dictatorship
    of the proletariat cannot be exercised through an organisation
    embracing the whole of that class, because in all capitalist
    countries (and not only over here, in one of the most backward)
    the proletariat is still so divided, so degraded, and so corrupted
    in parts (by imperialism in some countries) that an organisation
    taking in the whole proletariat cannot directly exercise
    proletarian dictatorship. It can be exercised only by a vanguard
    that has absorbed the revolutionary energy of the class. The whole
    is like an arrangement of cogwheels. Such is the basic mechanism
    of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and of the essentials of
    transition from capitalism to communism. From this alone it is
    evident that there is something fundamentally wrong in principle
    when Comrade Trotsky points, in his first thesis, to
    “ideological confusion”, and speaks of a crisis as
    existing specifically and particularly in the trade unions. If we
    are to speak of a crisis, we can do so only after analysing the
    political situation. It is Trotsky who is in “ideological
    confusion”, because in this key question of the trade
    unions’ role, from the standpoint of transition from
    capitalism to communism, he has lost sight of the fact that we
    have here a complex arrangement of cogwheels which cannot be a
    simple one; for the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be
    exercised by a mass proletarian organisation. It cannot work
    without a number of “transmission belts” running from
    the vanguard to the mass of the advanced class, and from the
    latter to the mass of the working people. In Russia, this mass is
    a peasant one. There is no such mass anywhere else, but even in
    the most advanced countries there is a non-proletarian, or a not
    entirely proletarian, mass. That is in itself enough to produce
    ideological confusion. But it’s no use Trotsky’s
    pinning it on others.
When I consider the role of the trade unions in production,
    find that Trotsky ’s basic mistake lies in his always
    dealing with it “in principle “, as a matter of
    “general principle”. All his theses are based on
    “general principle”, an approach which is in itself
    fundamentally wrong, quite apart from the fact that the Ninth
    Party Congress said enough and more than enough about the trade
    unions’ role in production,[2] and quite apart from
    the fact that in his own theses Trotsky quotes the perfectly clear
    statements of Lozovsky and Tomsky, who were to be his
    “whipping boys” and an excuse for an exercise in
    polemics. It turns out that there is, after all, no clash of
    principle, and the choice of Tomsky and Lozovsky, who wrote what
    Trotsky himself quotes, was an unfortunate one indeed. However
    hard we may look, we shall not find here any serious divergence of
    principle. In general, Comrade Trotsky’s great mistake, his
    mistake of principle, lies in the fact that by raising the
    question of “principle” at this time he is dragging
    back the Party and the Soviet power. We have, thank heaven, done
    with principles and have gone on to practical business. We chatted
    about principles—rather more than we should have—at
    the Smolny. Today, three years later, we have decrees on all
    points of the production problem, and on many of its components;
    but such is the sad fate of our decrees: they are signed, and then
    we ourselves forget about them and fail to carry them
    out. Meanwhile, arguments about principles and differences of
    principle are invented. I shall later on quote a decree dealing
    with the trade unions’ role in production, a decree all of
    us, including myself, I confess, have forgotten.
The actual differences, apart from those I have listed, really
    have nothing to do with general principles. I have had to
    enumerate my “differences” with Comrade Trotsky
    because, with such a broad theme as “The Role and Tasks of
    the Trade Unions”, he has, I am quite sure, made a number of
    mistakes bearing on the very essence of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat. But, this apart, one may well ask, why is it that we
    cannot work together, as we so badly need to do? It is because of
    our different approach to the mass, the different way of
    winning it over and keeping in touch with it. That is the
    whole point. And this makes the trade union a very peculiar
    institution, which is set up under capitalism, which inevitably
    exists in the transition from capitalism to communism, and whose
    future is a question mark. The time when the trade unions are
    actually called into question is a long way off: it will be up to
    our grandchildren to discuss that. What matters now is how to
    approach the mass, to establish contact with it and win it over,
    and how to get the intricate transmission system working (how to
    run the dictatorship of the proletariat). Note that when I speak
    oI the intricate transmission system I do not mean the machinery
    of the Soviets. What it may have in the way of intricacy of
    transmission comes under a special head. I have only been
    considering, in principle and in the abstract, class relations in
    capitalist society, which consists of a proletariat, a
    non-proletarian mass of working people, a petty bourgeoisie and a
    bourgeoisie. This alone yields an extremely complicated
    transmission system owing to what has been created by capitalism,
    quite apart from any red-tape in the Soviet administrative
    machinery. And that is the main point to be considered in
    analysing the difficulties of the trade unions’
    “task”. Let me say this again: the actual differences
    do not lie where Comrade Trotsky sees them but in the question of
    how to approach the mass, win it over, and keep in touch with
    it. I must say that had we made a detailed, even if small-scale,
    study of our own experience and practices, we should have managed
    to avoid the hundreds of quite unnecessary
    “differences” and errors of principle in which Comrade
    Trotsky’s pamphlet abounds. Some of his theses, for
    instance, polemicise against “Soviet
    trade-unionism”. As if we hadn’t enough trouble
    already, a new bogey has been invented. Who do you think it is?
    Comrade Ryazanov, of all people. I have known him for twenty odd
    years. You have known him less than that, but equally as well by
    his work. You are very well aware that assessing slogans is not
    one of his virtues, which he undoubtedly has. Shall we then
    produce theses to show that “Soviet trade-unionism” is
    just something that Comrade Ryazanov happened to say with little
    relevance? Is that being serious? If it is, we shall end up with
    having “Soviet trade unionism”, “Soviet
    anti-peace-signing”, and what not!

      A Soviet “ism” could be invented on every single
      point. (Ryazanov : “Soviet anti-Brestism.”)
      Exactly, “Soviet anti Brestism”.
While betraying this lack of thoughtfulness, Comrade Trotsky
      falls into error himself. He seems to say that in a workers’
      state it is not the business of the trade unions to stand up for
      the material and spiritual interests of the working class. That is
      a mistake. Comrade Trotsky speaks of a “workers’
      state”. May I say that this is an abstraction. It was
      natural for us to write about a workers’ state in 1917; but
      it is now a patent error to say: “Since this is a
      workers’ state without any bourgeoisie, against whom then is
      the working class to be protected, and for what purpose?”
      The whole point is that it is not quite a workers’
      state. That is where Comrade Trotsky makes one of his main
      mistakes. We have got down from general principles to practical
      discussion and decrees, and here we are being dragged back and
      prevented from tackling the business at hand. This will not
      do. For one thing, ours is not actually a workers’ state but
      a workers’ and peasants’ state. And a lot depends on
      that. (Bukharin : “What kind of state? A
      workers’ and peasants’ state?”) Comrade Bukharin
      back there may well shout “What kind of state? A
      workers’ and peasants’ state?” I shall not stop
      to answer him. Anyone who has a mind to should recall the recent
      Congress of Soviets,[3] and that will be answer enough.
But that is not all. Our Party Programme—a document which
      the author of the ABC of Communism knows very
      well—shows that ours is a workers’ state with a
      bureacratic twist to it. We have had to mark it with this
      dismal, shall I say, tag. There you have the reality of the
      transition. Well, is it right to say that in a state that has
      taken this shape in practice the trade unions have nothing to
      protect, or that we can do without them in protecting the
      material and spiritual interests of the massively organised
      proletariat?  No, this reasoning is theoretically quite
      wrong. It takes us into the sphere of abstraction or an ideal we
      shall achieve in 15 or 20 years’ time, and I am not so
      sure that we shall have achieved it even by then. What we
      actually have before us is a reality of which we have a good
      deal of knowledge, provided, that is, we keep our heads, and do
      not let ourselves be carried awav by intellectualist talk or
      abstract reasoning, or by what may appear to be
      “theory” but is in fact error and misapprehension of
      the peculiarities of transition. We now have a state under which
      it is the business of the massively organised proletariat to
      protect itself, while we, for our part, must use these
      workers’ organisations to protect the workers from their
      state, and to get them to protect our state. Both forms of
      protection are achieved through the peculiar interweaving of our
      state measures and our agreeing or “coalescing” with
      our trade unions.
I shall have more to say about this coalescing later on. But
    the word itself shows that it is a mistake to conjure up an enemy
    in the shape of “Soviet trade-unionism”, for
    “coalescing” implies the existence of
    distinct things that have yet to be coalesced:
    “coalescing” implies the need to be able to use
    measures of the state power to protect the material and spiritual
    interests of the massively organised proletariat from
    that very same state power. When the coalescing has produced
    coalescence and integration, we shall meet in
    congress for a business-like discussion of actual experience,
    instead of “disagreements” on principle or theoretical
    reasoning in the abstract. There is an equally lame attempt to
    find differences of principle with Comrades Tomsky and Lozovsky,
    whom Comrade Trotsky treats as trade union
    “bureaucrats”—I shall later on say which side in
    this controversy tends to be bureaucratic. We all know that while
    Comrade Ryazanov may love a slogan, and must have one which is all
    but an expression of principle, it is not one of Comrade
    Tomsky’s many vices. I think, therefore, that it would be
    going a bit too far to challenge Comrade Tomsky to a battle of
    principles on this score (as Comrade Trotsky has done). I am
    positively astonished at this. One would have thought that we had
    grown up since the days when we all sinned a great deal in the way
    of factional, theoretical and various other
    disagreements—although we naturally did some good as
    well. It is time we stopped inventing and blowing up differences
    of principle and got down to practical work. I never knew that
    Tomsky was eminently a theoretician or that he claimed to be one;
    it may be one of his failings, but that is something else
    again. Tomsky, who has been working very smoothly with the trade
    union- movement, must in his position provide a reflection of this
    complex transition—whether he should do so consciously or
    unconsciously is quite another matter and I am not saying that he
    has always done it consciously—so that if something is
    hurting the mass, and they do not know what it is, and he does not
    know what it is (applause, laughter ) but raises
    a howl, I say that is not a failing but should be put down to his
    credit. I am quite sure that Tomsky has many partial theoretical
    mistakes. And if we all sat down to a table and started
    thoughtfully writing resolutions or theses, we should correct them
    all; we might not even bother to do that because production work
    is more interesting than the rectifying of minute theoretical
    disagreements.
I come now to “industrial democracy”, shall I say,
    for Bukharin’s benefit. We all know that everyone has his
    weak points, that even big men have little weak spots, and this
    also goes for Bukharin. He seems to be incapable of resisting any
    little word with a flourish to it. He seemed to derive an almost
    sensuous pleasure from writing the resolution on industrial
    democracy at the Central Committee Plenum on December 7. But the
    closer I look at this “industrial democracy”, the more
    clearly I see that it is half-baked and theoretically false. It is
    nothing but a hodge-podge. With this as an example, let me say
    once again, at a Party meeting at least: “Comrade
    N. I. Bukharin, the Republic, theory and you yourself will benefit
    from less verbal extravagance.” (Applause.)
    Industry is indispensable. Democracy is a category proper only to
    the political sphere. There can be no objection to the use of this
    word in speeches or articles. An article takes up and clearly
    expresses one relationship and no more. But it is quite strange to
    hear you trying to turn this into a thesis, and to see you wanting
    to coin it into a slogan, uniting the “ayes” and the
    “nays”; it is strange to hear you say, like Trotsky,
    that the Party will have “to choose between two
    trends”. I shall deal separately with whether the Party must
    do any “choosing” and who is to blame for putting the
    Party in this position of having to “choose”. Things
    being what they are, we say: “At any rate, see that you
    choose fewer slogans, like ’industrial democracy’,
    which contain nothing but confusion and are theoretically
    wrong.” Both Trotsky and Bukharin failed to think out this
    term theoretically and ended up in confusion. “Industrial
    democracy” suggests things well beyond the circle of ideas
    with which they were carried away. They wanted to lay greater
    emphasis and focus attention on industry. It is one thing to
    emphasise something in an article or speech; it is quite another
    to frame it into a thesis and ask the Party to choose, and so I
    say: cast your vote against it, because it is confusion. Industry
    is indispensable, democracy is not. Industrial democracy breeds
    some utterly false ideas. The idea of one-man management was
    advocated only a little while ago. We must not make a mess of
    things and confuse people: how do you expect them to know when you
    want democracy, when one-man management, and when
    dictatorship. But on no account must we renounce dictatorship
    either—I hear Bukharin behind me growling: “Quite
    right.” (Laughter. Applause.)
But to go on. Since September we have been talking about
    switching from the principle of priority to that of equalisation,
    and we have said as much in the resolution of the all-Party
    conference, which was approved by the Central Committee.[4] The question is not an easy one,
    because we find that we have to combine equalisation with
    priority, which are incompatible. But after all we do have some
    knowledge of Marxism and have learned how and when opposites can
    and must be combined; and what is most important is that in the
    three and a half years of our revolution we have actually combined
    opposites again and again.
The question obviously requires thoughtfulness and
    circumspection. After all, we did discuss these questions of
    principle at those deplorable plenary meetings of the Central
    Committee[4b]—which yielded the groups of
    seven and eight, and Comrade Bukharin’s celebrated
    “buffer group”[6]—and we did
    establish that there was no easy transition from the priority
    principle to that of equalisation. We shall have to put in a bit
    of effort to implement the decision of the September
    Conference. After all, these opposite terms can be combined either
    into a cacophony or a symphony. Priority implies preference for
    one industry out of a group of vital industries because of its
    greater urgency. What does such preference entail? How great can
    it be? This is a difficult question, and I must say that it will
    take more than zeal to solve it; it may even take more than a
    heroic effort on the part of a man who is possibly endowed with
    many excellent qualities and who will do wonders on the right job;
    this is a very peculiar matter and calls for the correct
    approach. And so if we are to raise this question of priority and
    equalisation we must first of all give it some careful thought,
    but that is just what we fail to find in Comrade Trotsky’s
    work; the further he goes in revising his original theses, the
    more mistakes he makes. Here is what we find in his latest
    theses:
“The equalisation line should be pursued in the sphere of
    consumption, that is, the conditions of the working
    people’s existence as individuals. In the sphere of
    production, the principle of priority will long remain
    decisive for us”. . . (thesis 41, p. 31 of Trotsky’s
    pamphlet).
 This is a real theoretical muddle. It is all wrong. Priority
    is preference, but it is nothing without preference in
    consumption. If all the preference I get is a couple of ounces of
    bread a day I am not likely to be very happy. The preference part
    of priority implies preference in consumption as well. Otherwise,
    priority is a pipe dream, a fleeting cloud, and we are, after all,
    materialists. The workers are also materialists; if you say shock
    work, they say, let’s have the bread, and the clothes, and
    the beef. That is the view we now take, and have always taken, in
    discussing these questions time without number with reference to
    various concrete matters in the Council of Defence,[7] when one
    would say: “I’m doing shock work”, and would
    clamour for boots, and another: “I get the boots, otherwise
    your shock workers won’t hold out, and all your priority
    will fizzle out.”
We find, therefore, that in the theses the approach to
    equalisation and priority is basically wrong. What is more, it is
    a retreat from what has actually been achieved and tested in
    practice. We can’t have that; it will lead to no good.
Then there is the question of “coalescing “. The
    best thing to do about “coalescing” right now is to
    keep quiet. Speech is silver, but silence is golden. Why so? It is
    because we have got down to coalescing in practice; there is not a
    single large gubernia economic council, no major department of the
    Supreme Economic Council, the People’s Commissariat for
    Communications, etc., where something is not being coalesced in
    practice. But are the results all they should be? Ay,
    there’s the rub. Look at the way coalescence has actually
    been carried out, and what it has produced. There are countless
    decrees introducing coalescence in the various institutions. But
    we have yet to make a business-like study of our own practical
    experience; we have yet to go into the actual results of all this;
    we have yet to discover what a certain type of coalescence has
    produced in a particular industry, what happened when member X of
    the gubernia trade union council held post Y in the gubernia
    economic council, how many months he was at it, etc. What we have
    not failed to do is to invent a disagreement on coalescence as a
    principle, and make a mistake in the process, but then we have
    always been quick at that sort of thing; but we were not up to the
    mark when it came to analysing and verifying our own
    experience. When we have congresses of Soviets with committees not
    only on the application of the better-farming law in the various
    agricultural areas but also on coalescence and its results in the
    Saratov Gubernia flour-milling industry, the Petrograd metal
    industry, the Donbas coal industry, etc., and when these
    committees, having mustered the facts, declare: “We have
    made a study of so and so”, then I shall say: “Now we
    have got down to business, we have finally grown up.” But
    could anything be more erroneous and deplorable than the fact that
    we are being presented with “theses” splitting hairs
    over the principle of coalescence, after we have been at it for
    three years? We have taken the path of coalescence, and I am sure
    it was the right thing to do, but we have not yet made an adequate
    study of the results of our experience. That is why keeping quiet
    is the only common sense tactics on the question of
    coalescence.
A study must be made of practical experience. I have signed
    decrees and resolutions containing instructions on practical
    coalescence, and no theory is half so important as practice. That
    is why when I hear: “Let’s discuss
    ’coalescence’”, I say: “Let’s
    analyse what we have done.” There is no doubt that we have
    made many mistakes. It may well be that a great part of our
    decrees need amending. I accept that, for I am not in the least
    enamoured of decrees. But in that case let us have some practical
    proposals as to what actually has to be altered. That would be a
    business-like approach. That would not be a waste of time. That
    would not lead to bureaucratic projecteering But I find that that
    is exactly what’s wrong with Trotsky’s
    “Practical Conclusions”, Part VI of his pamphlet. He
    says that from one-third to one-half of the members of the All
    Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the Presidium of the
    Supreme Eccnomic Council should serve on both bodies, and from
    one-half to two-thirds, on the collegiums, etc. Why so? No special
    reason, just “rule of thumb”. It is true, of course,
    that rule of thumb is frequently used to lay down similar
    proportions in our decrees, but then why is it inevitable in
    decrees? I hold no brief for all decrees as such and have no
    intention of making them appear better than they actually
    are. Quite often rule of thumb is used in them to fix such purely
    arbitrary proportions as one-half or one-third of the total number
    of members, etc. When a decree says that, it means: try doing it
    this way, and later on we shall assess the results of your
    “try out”. We shall later sort out the results. After
    sorting them out, we shall move on. We are working on coalescence
    and we expect to improve it because we are becoming more efficient
    and practical-minded.
But I seem to have lapsed into “production
    propaganda”. That can’t be helped. It is a question
    that needs dealing with in any discussion of the role of the trade
    unions in production.
My next question will therefore be that of production
    propaganda. This again is a practical matter and we approach it
    accordingly. Government agencies have already been set up to
    conduct production propaganda. I can’t tell whether they are
    good or had; they have to be tested and there’s no need for
    any “theses” on this subject at all.
If we take a general view of the part trade unions have to play
    in industry, we need not, in this question of democracy, go beyond
    the usual democratic practices. Nothing will come of such tricky
    phrases as “industrial democracy”, for they are all
    wrong. That is the first point. The second is production
    propaganda. The agencies are there. Trotsky’s theses deal
    with production propaganda. That is quite useless, because in this
    case theses are old hat. We do not know as yet whether the
    agencies are good or bad. But we can tell after testing them in
    action. Let us do some studying and polling. Assuming, let us say,
    that a congress has 10 committees with 10 men on each, let us ask:
    “You have been dealing with production propaganda, haven
    ’t you? What are the results?” Having made a study of
    this, we should reward those who have done especially well, and
    discard what has proved unsuccessful. We do have some practical
    experience; it may not be much but it is there; yet we are being
    dragged away from it and back to these “theses on
    principles”. This looks more like a
    “reactionary” movement than “trade
    unionism”. 

    

      There is then the third point, that of
    bonuses. Here is the role and task of the trade unions in
    production: distribution of bonuses in kind. A start on
    it has been made. Things have been set in motion. Five hundred
    thousand poods of grain had been allocated for the purpose, and
    one hundred and seventy thousand has been distributed. How well
    and how correctly, I cannot tell. The Council of People’s
    Commissars was told that they were not making a good job of this
    distribution, which turned out to be an additional wage rather
    than a bonus. This was pointed out by officials of the trade
    unions and the People’s Commissariat for Labour. We
    appointed a commission to look into the matter but that has not
    yet been done. One hundred and seventy thousand poods of grain has
    been given away, but this needs to be done in such a way as to
    reward those who display the heroism, the zeal, the talent, and
    the dedication of the thrifty manager, in a word, all the
    qualities that Trotsky extols. But the task now is not to extol
    this in theses but to provide the bread and the
    beef. Wouldn’t it be better, for instance, to deprive one
    category of workers of their beef and give it as a bonus to
    workers designated as “shock” workers? We do not
    renounce that kind of priority. That is a priority we need. Let us
    take a closer look at our practices in the application of
    priority.
The fourth point is disciplinary courts. I hope Comrade
    Bukharin will not take offence if I say that without disciplinary
    courts the role of the trade unions in industry, “industrial
    democracy “, is a mere trifle. But the fact is that there is
    nothing at all about this in your theses. “Great
    grief!” is therefore the only thing that can be said about
    Trotsky’s theses and Bukharin’s attitude, from the
    standpoint of principle, theory and practice.
I am confirmed in this conclusion when I say to myself: yours
    is not a Marxist approach to the question. This quite apart from
    the fact that there are a number of theoretical mistakes in the
    theses It is not a Marxist approach to the evaluation of the
    “role and tasks of the trade unions”, because such a
    broad subject cannot be tackled without giving thought to the
    peculiar political aspects of the present situation. After all,
    Comrade Bukharin and I did say in the resolution of the Ninth
    Congress of the R.C.P. on trade unions that politics is the most
    concentrated expression of economics.
If we analysed the current political situation, we might say
    that we were going through a transition period within a transition
    period. The whole of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a
    transition period, but we now have, you might say, a heap of new
    transition periods: the demobilisation of the army, the end of the
    war, the possibility of having a much longer breathing space in
    peace than before, and a more solid transition from the war front
    to the labour front. This—and this alone—is causing a
    change in the attitude of the proletarian class to the peasant
    class. What kind of change is it? Now this calls for a close
    examination, but nothing of the sort follows from your
    theses. Until we have taken this close look, we must learn to
    wait. The people are overweary, considerable stocks that had to be
    used for certain priority industries have been so used; the
    proletariat’s attitude to the peasantry is undergoing a
    change. The war weariness is terrible, and the needs have
    increased, but production has increased insufficiently or not at
    all. On the other hand, as I said in my report to the Eighth
    Congress of Soviets, our application of coercion was correct and
    successful whenever we had been able to back it up from the start
    with persuasion. I must say that Trotsky and Bukharin have
    entirely failed to take account of this very important
    consideration.
Have we laid a sufficiently broad and solid base of persuasion
    for all these new production tasks? No, indeed, we have barely
    started doing it. We have not yet made the masses a party to
    them. Now I ask you, can the masses tackle these new assignments
    right away? No, they cannot, because while there is now no need
    for special propaganda on the question of, say, whether Wrangel
    the landowner should be overthrown or whether any sacrifices
    should be spared for the purpose, we have just started to work on
    this question of the role of the trade unions in production, and I
    mean the business aspect of the matter and not the question of
    “principle”, the reasoning about “Soviet
    trade-unionism” and such like trifles; we have just set up
    the agency for production propaganda, but we have as yet no
    experience. We have introduced the payment of bonuses in kind, but
    we lack the experience. We have set up the disciplinary courts,
    but we are not yet aware of the results. Still, from the political
    standpoint it is the preparedness of the masses that is
    crucial. Has the question been prepared, studied, weighed, and
    considered from this angle? No, far from it. And that is a basic,
    deep-going and dangerous political mistake, because if ever there
    was need to act according to the rule of measuring your cloth
    seven times before cutting it once, it is in this question. We
    find instead that the cutting has been started in earnest without
    a single measure having been taken. We are told that “the
    Party must choose between two trends”, but the false slogan
    of “industrial democracy “ was invented without a
    single measuring.
We must try to understand the meaning of this slogan,
    especially in the present political situation, when the masses are
    confronted with bureaucratic practices in visual form, and when we
    have the question itself on the agenda. Comrade Trotsky says in
    his theses that on the question of workers’ democracy it
    remains for the Congress to “enter it unanimously in the
    record”. That is not correct. There is more to it than an
    entry in the record; an entry in the record fixes what has been
    fully weighed and measured, whereas the question of industrial
    democracy is far from having been fully weighed, tried and
    tested. Just think how the masses may interpret this slogan of
    “industrial democracy”.
“We, the rank and file who work among the masses, say
    that there is need for new blood, that things must be corrected
    and the bureaucrats ousted, and here you are beating about the
    bush, talking about getting on with production and displaying
    democracy in achieving success in production; we refuse to get on
    with production under such a bureaucratic set-up of central and
    other boards, we want a different one.” You have not given
    the masses a chance to discuss things, to see the point, and to
    think it over; you have not allowed the Party to gain fresh
    experience but are already acting in haste, overdoing it, and
    producing formulas which are theoretically false. Just think how
    this mistake will be further amplified by unduly zealous
    functionaries! A political leader is responsible not only for the
    quality of his leadership but also for the acts of those he
    leads. He may now and again be unaware of what they are about, he
    may often wish they had not done some thing, but the
    responsibility still falls on him.
I now come to the November 9 and December 7 plenary meetings of
    the Central Committee, which gave expression to all these mistakes
    in action, rather than in logical categories, premises and
    theoretical reasoning. This threw the Centrai Committee into
    confusion; it is the first time this has happened in our
    Party’s history, in time of revolution, and it is
    dangerous. The crux was that there was a division, there was the
    “buffer” group of Bukharin, Preobrazhensky and
    Serebryakov, which did the most harm and created the most
    confusion.
You will recall the story of Glavpolitput[8] and
    Tsektran.[9] The resolution of the Ninth Congress
    of the R.C.P. in April 1920 said that Glavpolitput was being set
    up as a “temporary” institution, and that conditions
    should be brought back to normal “as soon as
    possible”. In September you read, “Return to normal
    conditions”.[9b] The plenary meeting was held in
    November (November 9), and Trotsky came up with his theses and
    ideas about trade-unionism. How ever fine some of his points about
    production propaganda may be, he should have been told that all
    this was neither here nor there, quite beside the mark, and a step
    backward it is something the C.C. should not be dealing with at
    present. Bukharin says: “It is very good.” It may be
    very good, but that is no answer to the question. After a heated
    debate, a resolution is adopted by 10 to 4 saying in a polite and
    comradely way that Tsektran has itself “already got down to
    . . . strengthening and developing methods of proletarian
    democracy within the union”. It adds that Tsektran must
    “take an active part in the general work of the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions, being incorporated in it on an
    egual footing with other trade union bodies”.
What is the gist of the Central Committee’s decision? It
    is obviously this: “Comrades of Tsektran! You must do more
    than go through the motions of carrying out Congress and
    C.C. decisions, you must actually do so to help all trade unions
    by your work, wipe out every trace of red tape, favouritism,
    arrogance, the we-are-better-than-you attitude, and boasts of
    being richer and getting more aid.”
 We then get down to brass tacks. A commission is set up, and
    the names of its members are published. Trotsky walks out, refuses
    to serve on the commission, and disrupts its work. What are his
    reasons? There is only one. Lutovinov is apt to play at
    opposition. That is true, and that also goes for Osinsky. Frankly
    speaking, it is not a pleasant game. But do you call that a
    reason? Osinsky was making an excellent job of the seed
    campaign. The thing to do was to work with him, in spite of his
    “opposition campaign”, for this business of disrupting
    the work of a commission is bureaucratic, un-Soviet, un-socialist,
    incorrect and politically harmful. Such methods are doubly
    incorrect and politically harmful at a time when there is need to
    separate the wheat from the chaff within the
    “opposition”. When Osinsky conducts an
    “opposition campaign”, I tell him: “This is a
    harmful campaign”, but it is a pleasure to see him conduct
    the seed campaign. I shall not deny that, like Ishchenko and
    Shlyapnikov, Lutovinov is making a mistake in his
    “opposition campaign”, but that is no reason to
    disrupt the work of a commission.
What did the commission in fact signify? It signified
    transition to practical work from intellectualist talk about
    sterile disagreements. What the commission was due to discuss and
    deal with was production propaganda, bonuses, and disciplinary
    courts. It was then that Comrade Bukharin, the head of the
    “buffer group”, together with Preobrazhensky and
    Serebryakov, seeing the Central Committee dangerously divided, set
    out to create a buffer, one that I find difficult to describe in
    parliamentary terms. If I could draw cartoons as well as Comrade
    Bukharin does, I would depict him as a man pouring a bucket of
    kerosene on the flames, and give the following caption:
    “Buffer kerosene”. Comrade Bukharin wanted to create
    something, and his intentions were no doubt most sincere and
    entirely in the “buffer” spirit. But the buffer failed
    to materialise; the upshot was that he failed to take account of
    the political situation and, what is more, made some theoretical
    mistakes.
Should all such disputes have been brought up for broad
    discussion? Was it worth going into these trifles? Was it worth
    wasting the few precious weeks before a Party congress? Wecould
    have used the timo to analyse and study the question of bonuses,
    disciplinary courts and coalescence. Those are the questions we
    could have given a practical solution to in the
    C.C. commission. If Comrade Bukharin wished to create a buffer,
    instead of giving a display of barking up the wrong tree, he
    should have demanded and insisted that Comrade Trotsky remained on
    the commission. If he had said and done that, we should have been
    on the right track, with the commission looking into the practical
    aspects of such things as one-man management, democracy,
    appointees, etc.
But to go on. By December (the December 7 Plenary Meeting), we
    were already faced with this flare-up of the watermen, which
    intensified the conflict, and as a result there were now eight
    votes in the Central Committee to our seven. Comrade Bukharin, in
    an effort to bring about a “reconciliation” through
    the use of his “buffer”, hastily wrote the
    “theoretical” part of the December plenum’s
    resolution, but with the commission a shambles, nothing, of
    course, could come of it.
Where did Glavpolitput and Tsektran err? Certainly not in their
    use of coercion; that goes to their credit. Their mistake was that
    they failed to switch to normal trade union work at the right time
    and without conflict, as the Ninth Congress of the
    R.C.P. required; they failed to adapt themselves to the trade
    unions and help them by meeting them on an equal footing. Heroism,
    zeal, etc., are the positive side of military experience; red-tape
    and arrogance are the negative side of the experience of the worst
    military types. Trotsky’s theses, whatever his intentions,
    do not tend to play up the best, but the worst in military
    experience. It must be borne in mind that a political leader is
    responsible not only for his own policy but also for the acts of
    those he leads.
The last thing I want to tell you about—something I
    called myself a fool for yesterday—is that I had altogether
    overlooked Comrade Rudzutak’s theses. His weak point is that
    he does not speak in ringing tones; he is not an impressive or
    eloquent speaker. He is liable to be overlooked. Unable to attend
    the meetings yesterday, I went through my material and found a
    printed leaflet issued for the Fifth All-Russia Trade Union
    Conference, which was-held from November 2 to 6, 1920.[11] It is
    called: The Tasks of the Trade Unions in Production. Let
    me read it to you, it is not long. 


      Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference

      The tasks of the trade unions in production

      (Theses Of Comrade Rudzutak’s Report)
1. Immediately after the October Revolution, the trade unions
    proved to be almost the only bodies which, while
    exercising workers’ control, were able and bound to
    undertake the work of organising and managing
    production. In that early period of the Soviet power, no
    state apparatus for the management of the national economy had yet
    been set up, while sabotage on the part of factory owners and
    senior technicians brought the working class squarely up against
    the task of safeguarding industry and getting the whole of the
    country’s economic apparatus back into normal running
    order.
2. In the subsequent period of the Supreme Economic
    Council’s work, when a considerable part of it consisted in
    liquidating private enterprises and organising state management to
    run them, the trade unions carried on this work jointly and
    side by side with the state economic management
    agencies.
 This parallel set-up was explained and justified by
    the weakness of the state agencies; historically it was vindicated
    by the establishment of full contact between the trade unions and
    the economic management agencies.
3. The centre of gravity in the management of industry
    and the drafting of a production programme shifted to these
    agencies as a result of their administration, the gradual
    spread of their control over production and management and
    the-co-ordination of the several parts. In view of this, the work
    of the trade unions in organising production was reduced to
    participation in forming the collegiums of chief
    administrations, central boards, and factory managements.
 4. At the present time, we are once again squarely faced with
    the question of establishing the closest possible ties between the
    economic agencies of the Soviet Republic and the trade unions, for
    the best use must be made of every working individual, and the
    whole mass of producers must be induced to take a conscious part
    in production, for the state apparatus of economic management,
    gradually gaining in size and complexity, has been transformed
    into a huge bureaucratic machine which is out of all proportion to
    the scale of industry, and is inevitably impelling the trade
    unions to take direct part in organising production not only
    through its men in the economic agencies but also as an organised
    whole.
 5. While the Supreme Economic Council’s point of
    departure in drawing up an overall production programme is the
    availability of the material elements of production (raw
    materials, fuel, the state of machinery, etc.), the trade unions
    must look at it from the standpoint of organising labour
    for the tasks of production and its best use. Therefore, the
    overall production programme, in whole and in
    part, must be drawn up with the participation of the
    trade unions in order to combine the use of the material
    resources of production and manpower in the best possible way.
6. Only if the whole mass of those engaged in production
    consciously take a hand in establishing real labour
    discipline, fighting deserters from the labour front, etc., can
    these tasks be fulfilled. Bureaueratic methods and orders
    will not do; it must be brought home to each participant in
    production that his production tasks are appropriate and
    important; that each must take a hand not only in fulfilling his
    assignments, but also play an intelligent part in correcting any
    technical and organisational defects in the sphere of
    production.
 The tasks of the trade unions in this sphere are
    tremendous. They must teach their members in each shop
    and in each factory to react to and take account of all
    defects in the use of manpower arising from improper handling
    of technical means or unsatisfactory management. The sum total
    of the experience gained by separate enterprises and industry
    as a whole must be used to combat red-tape, bureaucratic practices
    and carelessness. 
7. In order to lay special emphasis on the importance of these
    production tasks, they must be organisationally worked into
    current operations. As the economic departments of the
    trade unions, which are being set up in pursuance of the decision
    of the Third All-Russia Congress, extend their activity, they must
    gradually explain and define the nature of all trade union
    work. Thus, in the present social conditions, when all of
    production is geared to the satisfaction of the working
    people’s needs, wage rates and bonuses must be closely
    tied in with and must depend on the extent to which the production
    plan is fulfilled. Bonuses in kind and partial payment of
    wages in kind must be gradually transformed into a system of
    workers’ supply which depends on the level of labour
    productivity.
 8. Trade union work on these lines would, on the one hand, put
    an end to the existence of parallel bodies (political
    departments, etc.) and, on the other, restore the
    close ties between the masses and the economic management
    agencies.
 9. After the Third Congress, the trade unions largely failed
    to carry out their programme for participation in economic
    construction owing, first, to the military conditions,
    and second, to their organisational weakness and
    isolation from the administrative and practical work of the
    economic bodies.
 10. In view of this, the trade unions should set themselves
    the following immediate practical tasks: a) the most active
    participation in solving production and management problems; b)
    direct participation, with the respective economic agencies,
    in setting up competent administrative bodies; c) careful
    consideration of the various types of management bodies,
    and their influence on production; d) unfailing participation in
    working out and laying down economic plans and production
    programmes; e) organisation of labour in accordance with
    the economic priorities; f) development of an extensive
    organization for production agitation and propaganda.
 11. The economic departments of the trade unions and
    of their organisations must be actually transformed into powerful
    and expeditious levers for the trade unions’ systematic
    participation in organising production.
12. In the matter of providing workers with steady material
    supplies, the trade unions must shift their influence onto the
    distribution bodies of the Commissariat for Food, both local
    and central, taking a practical and business-like part and
    exercising controI in all the distributive bodies, and
    paying special attention to the activity of central and gubernia
    workers’ supply commissions.
 13. In view of the fact that the narrow departmental interests
    of some chief administrations, central boards, etc., have plunged
    the so-called “priority” into a state of utter
    confusion, the trade unions must everywhere uphold the real order
    of economic priorities and review the existing system so as to
    determine them in accordance with the actual importance of the
    various industries and the availability of material resources in
    the country.
 14. Special attention must be given to the so-called model
    group of factories to help them set an example through the
    organisation of efficient management, labour discipline and trade
    union activities.
 15. In labour organisation, apart from the introduction of a
    harmonious wage-rate system and the overhaul of output rates, the
    trade unions should take a firm hand in fighting the various
    forms of labour desertion (absenteeism, lateness,
    etc.). The disciplinary courts, which have not received due
    attention until now, must be turned into a real means of combating
    breaches of proletarian labour discipline.
 16. The economic departments must be entrusted with the
    fulfilment of these tasks and also the drafting of a practical
    plan for production propaganda and a number of measures to improve
    the economic condition of the workers. It is necessary, therefore,
    to authorise the economic department of the All-Russia Central
    Council of Trade Unions to call a special All-Russia Conference of
    Economic Departments in the near future to discuss the practical
    problems of economic construction in connection with the world of
    state economic agencies.
I hope you see now why I called myself names. There you have a
    platform, and it is very much better than the one Comrade Trotsky
    wrote after a great deal of thinking, and the one Comrade Bukharin
    wrote (the December 7 Plenum resolution) without any thinking at
    all. All of us members of the Central Committee who have been out
    of touch with the trade Union movement for many years would profit
    from Comrade Rudzutak’s experience, and this also goes for
    Comrade Trotsky and Comrade Bukharin. The trade unions have
    adopted this platform.
 We all entirely forgot about the disciplinary courts, but
    “industrial democracy”, without bonuses in kind or
    disciplinary courts, is nothing but empty talk.
 I make a comparison between Rudzutak’s theses and those
    submitted by Trotsky to the Central Committee. At the end of
    thesis 5, I read:
“. . a reorganisation of the unions must be started right
    away, that is, a selection of functionaries must be above all made
    from precisely that angle”. . . .
    
 
      There you have an example of the real bureaucratic approach:
      Trotsky and Krestinsky selecting the trade union
      “functionaries”!
Let me say this once again: here you have an explanation of
    Tsektran’s mistake. It was not wrong to use pressure; that
    goes to its credit. It made the mistake of failing to cope with
    the general tasks of all the trade unions, of failing to act
    itself and to help all the trade unions to employ the disciplinary
    comrades’ courts more correctly, swiftly and
    successfully. When I read about the disciplinary courts in Comrade
    Rudzutak’s theses it occurred to me that there might be a
    decree on this matter. And in fact there was. It is the
    Regulations Governing Workers’ Disciplinary
    Comrades’ Courts, issued on November 14, 1919
    (Collection of Statutes No. 537).
The trade unions have the key role in these courts I
    don’t know how good these courts are, how well they
    function, and whether they always function. A study of our own
    practical experience would be a great deal more useful than
    anything Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin have written.
Let me end by summing up everything there is on the question. I
    must say that it was a great mistake to put up these disagreements
    for broad Party discussion and the Party Congress. It was a
    political mistake. We should have had a business-like discussion
    in the commission, and only there, and would have in that case
    moved forward; as it is we are sliding back, and shall keep
    sliding back to abstract theoretical propositions for several
    weeks, instead of dealing with the problem in a business-like
    manner. Personally, I am sick and tired of it, and quite apart
    from my illness, it would give me great pleasure to get away from
    it all. I am prepared to seek refuge anywhere.
The net result is that there are a number of theoretical
    mistakes in Trotsky’s and Bukharin’s theses: they
    contain a number of things that are wrong in
    principle. Politically, the whole approach to the matter is
    utterly tactless. Comrade Trotsky’s “theses” are
    politically harmful. The sum and substance of his policy is
    bureaucratic harassment of the trade unions. Our Party Congress
    will, I am sure, condemn and reject it. (Prolonged,
    stormy applause.)

Endnotes
[1]
    Lenin’s first speech to Party activists in the discussion of
    the role and tasks of the trade unions in socialist construction
    was delivered at the Bolshoi Theatre on December 30, 1920.
Trotsky had started the discussion in the
    Communist group of the Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference on
    November 3 with his call “to tighten the screws of War
    Communism” as opposed to the Party’s line to stimulate
    democratic activity in the trade unions. 
The disagreements turned “on the
    different approach to the mass, the way of winning it over, and
    keeping in touch with it” (Lenin ). The
    disagreements in the group were brought before the Central
    Committee Plenary Meeting. But Trotsky’s December 24 speech
    before the delegates of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets
    and trade union activists carried the issue outside the Central
    Committee. On December 25, he published his views in a
    pamphlet. 
Lenin was against any discussion, believing
    that it distracted the Party’s attention and forces from the
    immediate tasks of fighting the economic dislocation and the
    famine. In his-speeches and articles— The Party Crisis
     and  Once Again on the Trade Unions, the Current
    Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin —he
    put forward and developed a number of important principles
    underlying the trade unions’ role in the dictatorship of the
    proletariat and their tasks in socialist construction.
The discussion lasted more than two months. The
    overwhelming majority of the Party organisations approved
    Lenin’s platform and rejected the opposition’s. The
    results of the discussion were summed up at the Tenth Congress of
    the Party on March 8-16, 1921.
[2]
    On its agenda were the current tasks of economic construction and
    the question of the trade union movement. It defined the
    short-term economic tasks and stressed the need for the trade
    unions’ active participation in socialist construction. It
    adopted the following resolutions: “The Current Tasks of
    Econormic Construction” and “The Trade Unions and
    Their Organisation”. See K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiakh i
    resheniakh syezdov, konferentsi i plenumov TsK (The
    C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses,
    Conferences and C.C Plenary Meetings, Part 1, 1954, pp. 477-90,
    490-94).
[3]The reference is to the Eighth All-Russia
    Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Red Army
    and Cossack Deputies held in Moscow on December 22-29, 1920. It
    was attended by 2,537 delegates, the greatest number ever. Of them
    1,728 had voice and vote, and 809, voice only. Of the total number
    of delegates 91.7 per cent were Communists; 2.7, Communist
    sympathisers; 3.9, non-party people; 0.3, Mensheviks; 0.3,
    Bundists; 0.15, Left S.R.s; 0.15, anarchists, and 0.8, from other
    parties.
The Congress met at a time when the war against
    the foreign intervention and internal counter-revolution was
    coming to a end, and when the economic front stood out as
    “the main and most important one” (Lenin
    ). On its agenda there were the following questions, the chief of
    which had been discussed beforehand by the Communist group: report
    on the activity of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and
    the Council of People’s Commissars, electrification of
    Russia; rehabilitation of industry and transport; development of
    agricultural production and promotion of farming; efficiency of
    Soviet establishments and the struggle against bureaucratic
    practices. These problems were thrashed out in three sections:
    industry, agriculture and Soviet administration.
Lenin guided much of the work of the
    Congress. At the plenary meeting on December 22, he gave a report
    on the activity of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and
    the Council of People’s Commissars, and on December 23, he
    summed up the debate. He spoke six times at the Communist group
    meetings on December 21, 22, 24 and 27 on the question of
    concessions and the draft law on measures to consolidate and
    develop peasant farming. By an overwhelming majority, the Congress
    adopted a resolution on Lenin’s report, approving the
    government’s activity, and rejected a draft resolution
    motioned by the other delegates.
The Congress adopted a plan for the
    electrification of the country (GOELRO), worked out on
    Lenin’s initiative and instructions. This was the first
    long-range economic plan of the Soviet state and Lenin called it
    “the second Party Programme”. He also wrote the
    resolution on Krzhizhanovsky’s report.
Another major question on the agenda was a
    draft law on measures to consolidate and develop peasant farming,
    which had been adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars
    on December 14, 1920. Lenin stressed that the law was “a
    kind of a focus around which hundreds of decrees and bills of the
    Soviet power were grouped”. Lenin took part in the
    discussion of its principal clauses by the non-Party peasant
    delegates to the Congress at a special meeting on December 22, and
    by the Communist group on December 24 and 27. The draft law was
    adopted unanimously.
The Congress passed a comprehensive resolution
    to improve and reorganise the entire Soviet apparatus as required
    by the transition to peaceful economic construction. It regulated
    relations between central and local organs of power and
    administration. The Congress also discussed the reorganisation of
    the whole system of economic management in accordance with the new
    economic tasks, and approved a new statute of the Council of
    Labour and Defence.
It instituted the Order of the Red Banner
    of Labour as an award for dedication, initiative, efficiency
    and hard work in solving economic tasks.
[4]
    The reference is to the resolution of the Ninth All-Russia
    Conference of the R.C.P.(B.), “The Current Tasks of Party
    Organisation”. See K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiakh
    . . . (The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of
    Congresses, Conferences and C.C. Plenary Meetings, Part 1, 1954,
    pp. 506-12).
[4b] The reference is to the November and
    December plenary meeting of the Central Committee in 1920. For the
    text of their resolutions see Pravda No. 255 of November
    13, and No. 281 of December 14, and also Izvestia of the C.C.,
    R.C.P. [5] No. 26 of December 20.
[5]
Izvestia of the Central Committee of the Russian
      Communist Party was an information organ dealing with Party
      problems. It was published under a resolution of the Eighth
      Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) as a weekly supplement to
      Pravda from May 28, 1919, and as an independent organ
      from October 1920.
In 1929, it was transformed into a fortnightly,
    Partiinoye Stroitelstvo (Party Construction ),
    and in June 1946 renamed Partiinaya Zhizn (Party
    Life ).
[6]
    The “buffer group” took shape during the
    trade union discussion in 1920-21. It was headed by N. I. Bukharin
    and included Y. Larin, Y. A. Preobrazhensky, L. P. Serebryakov,
    G. Y. Sokolnikov, V. N. Yakovleva and others. They tried to
    reconcile the differences between Lenin and Trotsky’s views,
    acting as a “buffer” in disagreements on the question
    of the role and tasks of the trade unions. In fact Bukharin
    attacked Lenin and defended Trotsky.
Lenin characterised the “buffer”
    group and its anti-Party views in his article, “The Party
    Crisis”, in the pamphlet, Once Again on the Trade
    Unions, the Current Situation and the Mistakes of Trotsky and
    Bukharin, and elsewhere. 
[7]
The Council of Workers’ and Peasants’
      Defence was set up by the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee on November 30, 1918, to implement its September 2,
      1918 decree which proclaimed the Soviet Republic a military
      camp. Lenin was appointed its Chairman. It was vested with
      extraordinary powers in mobilising the resources of the Soviet
      state for defence in that exceptionally difficult period.
The Council was the Republic’s chief
    military-economic and planning centre during the intervention and
    Civil War and also controlled the activity of the Revolutionary
    Military Council and other military organs. Its decrees were
    binding on all Soviet citizens, as well as on central and local
    agencies. Early in April 1920, it was reorganised into the Council
    of Labour and Defence (C.L.D.) (Soviet Truda i
    Oborony—STO), and under a decision of the Eighth
    All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December 1920 it began to
    operate as a government commission responsible for co-ordinating
    the work of all economic departments. It was abolished in
    1937.
[8]
Glavpolitput—the Chief Political Department of the
    People’s Commissariat for Communications—was formed as
    a provisional organ under the direct leadership of the
    Party’s Central Committee in February 1919, and in January
    1920 it was renamed the Chief Political Administration. It took
    extraordinary measures to rehabilitate the railways that had been
    ruined in the imperialist war and the Civil War, to improve Party
    and political work among railway workers, and to strengthen and
    stimulate the activity of the railwaymen’s trade union and
    make it an instrument for the further development of the
    railways. It introduced military discipline on the railways to
    gear them to the war effort. The measures effected by Glavpolitput
    saved the railways from utter ruin, but produced bureaucratic and
    undemocratic practices in the trade unions and a tendency to lose
    touch with the masses.
It was abolished by a Central Committee
    decision on December 7, 1920, at the end of the Civil War and the
    start of peaceful development.
[9]
Tsektran—the Central Committee of the Joint Trade
    Union of Rail and Water Transport Workers. In September 1920, the
    two unions were merged to set up a strong centralised
    administration capable of tackling the tasks of rapidly
    rehabilitating transport, whose stoppages tended to paralyse the
    national economy. Its extraordinary powers and military methods of
    work, which sprang from the enormity of the tasks before it, bred
    bureaucratic practices, the appointments system, administration by
    injunction, etc. The plenary meetings of the C.C. on November 8
    and December 7, 1920, condemned Tsektran’s methods and
    adopted a decision to incorporate it into the general system of
    the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions on a par with other
    unions. Tsektrall was advised to change its methods, develop trade
    union democracy, make all trade union bodies elective, reduce the
    appointments system, etc. The First All-Russia Congress of
    Transport Workers in March 1921 called by the Central Committee of
    the Party expelled those communists who opposed this reform from
    the Tsektran leadership and outlined new methods of work.
[9b] See Izvestia of the C.C., R.C.P.
    No. 26, p. 2, the Resolution of the September Plenum of the C.C.,
    Paragraph 3, which said: “The C.C. further believes that
    there has been a great improvement in the grave situation in the
    transport workers’ unions, which produced Glavpolitput and
    Politvod,[10] as temporary levers for assisting and
    organising the work. Therefore, incorporation of these
    organisations in the union, as union agencies being adapted to and
    absorbed by the union apparatus, can and must now
    proceed.”
[10]
Politvod—the Chief Political Administration of
    Water Transport of the People’s Commissariat for
    Communications—was set up inApril 1920 as an agency of
    Glavpolitput to carry on political education among the workers and
    exercise political control over the technical and administrative
    personnel; to put water transport on its feet as soon as possible;
    to stimulate higher productivity and improve discipline. It was
    dissolved in December 1920.
[11]
    The Party wanted the trade unions’ work reorganised in
    accordance with the tasks of peaceful socialist construction,
    democracy developed and military methods of administration
    abolished. This was opposed by Trotsky, who demanded, at the
    Communist group meeting on November 3, a “shake-up” of
    the trade unions. He wanted “the screws tightened” and
    the trade unions governmentalised immediately. He disagreed on the
    “approach to the mass, the way of winning it over, and
    keeping in touch with it”. His speech started the Party
    discussion on the trade unions, but the Communist delegates
    rejected his demands, for their realisation would have abolished
    the trade unions and undermined the dictatorship of the
    proletariat. That is why his theses were discussed by the Party
    Central Committee. At the November 8 C.C. Plenary Meeting, Lenin
    came out with his own theses which, when put to the vote, won 8
    votes, as against 7 for Trotsky’s.

The pre-Congress discussion is in full swing. Minor
    differences and disagreements have grown into big ones, which
    always happens when someone persists in a minor mistake and balks
    at its correction, or when those who are making a big mistake
    seize on the minor mistake of one or more persons.
That is how disagreements and splits always grow. That is how
    we “grew up”from minor disagreements to syndicalism,
    which means a complete break with communism and an inevitable
    split in the Party if it is not healthy and strong enough to purge
    itself of the malaise.
We must have the courage to face the bitter truth. The Party is
    sick. The Party is down with the fever. The whole point is whether
    the malaise has affected only the “feverish upper
    ranks”, and perhaps only those in Moscow, or the whole
    organism. And if the latter is the case, is it capable of healing
    itself completely within the next few weeks, before the Party
    Congress and at the Party Congress, making a relapse impossible,
    or will the malaise linger and become dangerous?
What is it that needs to be done for a rapid and certain cure?
    All members of the Party must make a calm and painstaking
    study of 1) the essence of the disagreements and 2) the
    development of the Party struggle. A study must be made of both,
    because the essence of the disagreements is revealed, clarified
    and specified (and very often transformed as well) in the
    course of the struggle, which, passing through its
    various stages, always shows, at every stage, a different
    line-up and number of combatants, different positions in
    the struggle, etc. A study must be made of both, and a demand made
    for the most exact, printed documents that can be thoroughly
    verified. Only a hopeless idiot will believe oral statements. If
    no documents are available, there must be an examination
    of witnesses on both or several sides and the grilling must take
    place in the presence of witnesses.
Let me outline the essence of the disagreements and the
    successive stages in the struggle, as I see them.
Stage one. The Fifth All-Russia Trade Union Conference November
    2-6. The battle is joined. Trotsky and Tomsky are the only Central
    Committee ’’combatants’’. Trotsky lets
    drop a “catchy phrase”about “shaking
    up”the trade unions. Tomsky argues very heatedly. The
    majority of the Central Committee members are on the fence. The
    serious mistake they (and I above all) made was that we
    “overlooked”Rudzutak’s theses, The Tasks of
    the Trade Unions in Production, adopted by the Fifth
    Conference. That is the most important document in the
    whole of the controversy.
Stage two. The Central Committee Plenum of November 9 Trotsky
    submits his “draft theses”, The Trade Unions and
    Their Future Role, advocating the
    “shake-up”policy camouflaged or adorned with
    talk of a “severe crisis”gripping the trade unions,
    and their new tasks and methods Tomsky, strongly supported by
    Lenin, considers that in view of Tsektran’s irregularities
    and bureaucratic excesses it is the “shake-up”that is
    the crux of the whole controversy. In the course of it, Lenin
    makes a number of obviously exaggerated and therefore mistaken
    “attacks”, which produces the need for a “buffer
    group”, and this is made up of ten members of the Central
    Committee (the group includes Bukharin and Zinoviev, but neither
    Trotsky nor Lenin). It resolves “not to put the
    disagreements up for broad discussion”, and, cancelling
    Lenin’s report (to the trade unions), appoints Zinoviev
    as the rapporteur and instructs him to “present a
    business-like and non-controversial report.
Trotsky’s theses are rejected. Lenin’s theses are
    adopted in its final form, the resolution is adopted by ten votes
    to four (Trotsky, Andreyev, Krestinsky and Rykov). And this
    resolution advocates “sound forms of the militarisation of
    labour”, condemns “the degeneration of centralism and
    militarised forms of work into bureaucratic practices, petty
    tyranny, red-tape”, etc. Tsektran is instructed to
    “take a more active part in the general work of the
    All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, being incorporated in
    it on an equal footing with other trade union bodies.
The Central Committee sets up a trade union commission and
    elects Comrade Trotsky to it. He refuses to work on the
    commission, magnifying by this step alone his original
    mistake, which subsequently leads to factionalism. Without that
    step, his mistake (in submitting incorrect theses) remained a very
    minor one, such as every member of the Central Committee, without
    exception, has had occasion to make.
Stage three. The conflict between the water transport workers
    and Tsektran in December. The Central Committee Plenary Meeting of
    December 7. It is no longer Trotsky and Lenin, but Trotsky and
    Zinoviev who are the chief “combatants”.As chairman of
    the trade union commission, Zinoviev inquires into the December
    dispute between the water transport workers and Tsektran. The
    Central Committee Plenary Meeting of December 7. Zinoviev makes a
    practical proposal for an immediate change in the composition of
    Tsektran. This is opposed by a majority of the Central
    Committee. Rykov goes over to Zinoviev’s
    side. Bukharin’s resolution—the substantive part of
    which is three-quarters in favour of the water transport workers,
    while the preamble, rejecting the proposal to
    “reconstruct”the trade unions “from
    above”(§3), approves of the celebrated
    “industrial democracy”(§5)—is adopted. Our
    group of Central Committee members is in the minority, being
    opposed to Bukharin’s resolution chiefly because we consider
    the “buffer”a paper one; for Trotsky’s
    non-participation in the trade union commission’s work
    actually implies a continuation of the struggle and its transfer
    outside the Central Committee. We propose that the Party Congress
    be convened on February 6, 1921. That is adopted. The postponement
    to March 6 was agreed to later, on the demand of the outlying
    areas.
 Stage four. The Eighth Congress of Soviets. On December 25,
    Trotsky issues his “platform pamphlet “, The Role
    and Tasks of the Trade Unions. From the standpoint of formal
    democracy, Trotsky had an uncontested right to issue his platform,
    for on December 24 the Central Committee had permitted free
    discussion. From the standpoint of revolutionary interest, this
    was blowing up the mistake out of all proportion and creating
    a faction on a faulty platform. The pamphlet quotes from the
    Central Committee resolution of December 7 only that part which
    refers to “industrial democracy”but does not
    quote what was said against “reconstruction from
    above”.The buffer created by Bukharin on December 7 with
    Trotsky’s aid was wrecked by Trotsky on December 25. The
    pamphlet from beginning to end is shot through with the
    “shake-up”spirit. Apart from its intellectualist
    flourishes (“production atmosphere”, “industrial
    democracy”), which are wrong in theory and in practice fall
    within the concept, ambit and tasks of production propaganda, it
    fails to indicate any “new”“tasks or
    methods”that were to gild or camouflage or justify the
    “shake-up”.
Stage five. The discusson before thousands of responsible Party
    workers from all over Russia at the R.C.P. group of the Eighth
    Congress of Soviets on December 30. The controversy flares up to
    full blast. Zinoviev and Lenin on one side, Trotsky and Bukharin
    on the other. Bukharin wants to play the “buffer, but speaks
    only against Lenin and Zinoviev, and not a word against
    Trotsky. Bukharin reads out an excerpt from his theses (published
    on January 16), but only that part which says nothing about the
    rupture with communism and the switch to syndicalism. Shlyapnikov
    (on behalf of the Workers’ Opposition[1]) reads
    out the syndicalist platform, which Trotsky had demolished before
    hand (thesis 16 of his platform) and which (partly, perhaps, for
    that reason) no one is inclined to take seriously.
In my opinion, the climax of the whole discussion of December
    30 was the reading of Comrade Rudzutak’s theses. Indeed,
    Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin, far from being able to object to
    them, even invented the legend that the “best part”of
    the theses had been drawn up by members of
    Tsektran—Holtzmann, Andreyev and Lyubimov. And that is
    why Trotsky humorously and amiably twitted Lenin on his
    unsuccessful “diplolacy”, by which, he said, Lenin had
    wanted to “call off or disrupt”the discussion, and
    find a “lightning conductor”, “accidentally
    catching hold of Tsektran instead of the lightning
    conductor”.
The legend was exploded that very day, December 30, by
    Rudzutak, who pointed out that Lyubimov “did not
    exist”on the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions,
    that in its presidium Holtzmann had voted against these theses,
    and that they had been drawn up by a commission consisting of
    Andreyev, Tsiperovich and himself.[2]
But let us for a moment assume that Comrades Trotsky and
    Bukharin’s legend is true. Nothing so completely defeats
    them as such an assumption. For what is the conclusion if the
    “Tsektranites”had inserted their
    “new”ideas into Rudzutak’s resolution, if
    Rudzutak had accepted them, if all the trade unions had adopted
    this resolution (November 2-6!), and if Bukharin and Trotsky have
    nothing to say against it?
It is that all of Trotsky’s disagreements are artificial,
    that neither he nor the
    “Tsektranites”have any “new tasks or
    methods”, and that everything practical and substantive had
    been said, adopted and decided upon by the trade unions,
    even before the question was raised in the Central
    Committee.
If anyone ought to be taken thoroughly to task and
    “shaken up”, it is not the All-Russia Central Council
    of Trade Unions but the Central Committee of the R.C.P., for
    having “overlooked”Rudzutak’s theses, a mistake
    which allowed an altogether empty discussion to flare up. There is
    nothing to cover up the mistake of the Tsektranites
    (which is not an excessive one but is, in essence, a very common
    one, consisting in some exaggeration of bureaucracy). What is
    more, it needs to be rectified, and not covered up, toned down or
    justified. That’s all there is to it.
I summed up the substance of Rudzutak’s theses on
    December 30 in four points: 1) Ordinary democracy (without any
    exaggerations, without denying the Central Committee’s right
    of “appointment”, etc., but also without any obstinate
    defence of the mistakes and excesses of certain
    “appointees”, which need to be rectified); 2)
    Production propaganda (this includes all that is practical in
    clumsy, ridiculous, theoretically wrong “formulas”like
    “industrial democracy”, “production
    atmosphere”, etc.). We have established a Soviet
    institution, the All-Russia Production Propaganda Bureau. We
    must do everything to support it and not spoil production work by
    producing . . . bad theses. That’s all there is to
    it; 3) Bonuses in kind and 4) Disciplinary comrades’
    courts. Without Points 3 and 4, all talk about “the role and
    tasks in production”, etc., is empty, highbrow chatter; and
    it is these two points that are omitted from Trotsky’s
    “platform pamphlet”.But they are in Rudzutak’s
    theses.
While dealing with the December 30 discussion, I must correct
    another mistake of mine. I said: “Ours is not actually a
    workers’ state but a workers’ and peasants’
    state.”Comrade Bukharin immediately exclaimed: ’What
    kind of a state?”In reply I referred him to the Eighth
    Congress of Soviets, which had just closed. I went back to the
    report of that discussion and found that I was wrong and Comrade
    Bukharin was right. What I should have said is: “A
    workers’ state is an abstraction. What we actually have is a
    workers’ state, with this peculiarity, firstly, that it is
    not the working class but the peasant population that predominates
    in the country, and, secondly, that it is a workers’ state
    with bureaucratic distortions.”Anyone who reads the whole of
    my speech will see that this correction makes no difference to my
    reasoning or conclusions.
Stage six. The Petrograd organisation issues an “Appeal
    to the Party”against Trotsky’s platform, and the
    Moscow Committee issues a counter-statement (Pravda,
    January 13[3]).
This is a transition from the struggle between factions, formed
    from above, to the intervention of lower organisations. It is a
    big step towards recovery. Curiously enough, the Moscow Committee
    noticed the “dangerous”side of the Petrograd
    organisation’s issuing a platform, but refused to
    notice the dangerous side of Comrade Trotsky’s
    forming a faction on December 25! Some wags have said this is
    “buffer”(one-eyed) blindness.
Stage seven. The trade union commission concludes its work and
    issues a platform (a pamphlet, entitled Draft Decision of the
    Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. on the Role and Tasks of the Trade
    Unions,[4] dated January 14 and signed by nine
    members of the Central Committee—Zinoviev, Stalin, Tomsky,
    Rudzutak, Kalinin, Kamenev, Petrovsky, Artyom and Lenin, and also
    by Lozovsky, a member of the trade union commission; Comrades
    Shlyapnikov and Lutovinov seem to have “fled”to the
    Workers’ Opposition). It was published in Pravda on
    January 18, with the following additional signatures: Schmidt,
    Tsiperovich and Milyutin.
On January 16, Pravda carries the Bukharin platform
    (signed: “On behalf of a group of comrades, Bukharin, Larin,
    Preobrazhensky, Serebryakov, Sokolnikov, Yakovleva”) and the
    Sapronov platform (signed: “A group of comrades standing for
    democratic centralism”, Bubnov, Boguslavsky, Kamensky,
    Maximovsky, Osinsky, Rafail, Sapronov).[5] The enlarged meeting
    of the Moscow Committee on January 17 was addressed by spokesmen
    for these platforms, and also by the
    ’’Ignatovites’’[6](theses published in
    Pravda on January 19 and signed by Ignatov, Orekhov, Korzinov,
    Kuranova, Burovtsev, Maslov).[7]
What we find here is, on the one hand, increased solidarity
    (for the platform of the nine Central Committee members is in
    complete accord with the decision of the Fifth All-Russia
    Conference of Trade Unions); and, on the other, confusion and
    disintegration, with Bukharin and Co.’s theses being an
    all-time low in ideological disintegration. We have here
    one of those “turns”which in the old days Marxists
    used to call “not so much historical as
    hysterical”.Thesis 17 says: “At the present time,
    these nominations must be made mandatory ”(that is,
    the trade unions’ nominations to the respective “chief
    administrations and central boards”).
This is a clean break with communism and a transition to
    syndicalism. It is, in essence, a repetition of
    Shlyapnikov’s “unionise the state”slogan, and
    means transferring the Supreme Economic Council apparatus
    piecemeal to the respective trade unions. To say, “I propose
    mandatory nominations”, is exactly the same as
    saying, “I appoint”.
Communism says: The Communist Party, the vanguard of the
    proletariat, leads the non-Party workers’ masses, educating,
    preparing, teaching and training the masses
    (“school”of communism)—first the workers and
    then the peasants—to enable them eventually to concentrate
    in their hands the administration of the whole national
    economy.
Syndicalism hands over to the mass of non-Party workers, who
    are compartmentalised in the industries, the management of their
    industries (“the chief administrations and central
    boards”), thereby making the Party superfluous, and failing
    to carry on a sustained campaign either in training the masses or
    in actually concentrating in their hands the
    management of the whole national economy.
The Programme of the R.C.P. says: “The trade unions
    should eventually arrive ”(which means that they
    are not yet there or even on the way) “at a de
    facto concentration in their hands”(in their,
    that is, the hands of the trade unions, that is, the hands of the
    fully organised masses; anyone will see how far we have
    still to go even to the very first approaches to this de
    facto concentration) . . . concentration of what? “of
    the whole administration of the whole national economy, as a
    single economic entity”thence, not branches of industry, or
    even industry as a whole, but industry plus agriculture,
    etc. Are we anywhere near to actually concentrating the management
    of agriculture in the hands of the trade unions?). The
    R.C.P. Programme then speaks of the “ties”between the
    “central state administration”and the “broad
    masses of toilers”, and of the “participation
    of the trade unions in running the economy”.
Why have a Party, if industrial management is to be appointed
    (“mandatory nomination”) by the trade unions
    nine-tenths of whose members are non-Party workers? Bukharin has
    talked himself into a logical, theoretical and practical
    implication of a split in the Party, or, rather, a breakaway of
    the syndicalists from the Party.
Trotsky, who had been “chief”in the struggle, has
    now been “outstripped”and entirely
    “eclipsed”by Bukharin, who has thrown the struggle
    into an altogether new balance by talking himself into a mistake
    that is much more serious than all of Trotsky’s put
    together.
How could Bukharin talk himself into a break with communism? We
    know how soft Comrade Bukharin is; it is one of the qualities
    which endears him to people, who cannot help liking him. We know
    that he has been ribbed for being as “soft as wax”.It
    turns out that any “unprincipled”person, any
    “demagogue”can leave any mark he likes on this
    “soft wax”.The sharp words in quotation marks were
    used by Comrade Kamenev, during the January 17 discussion, and he
    had a perfect right to do so. But, of course, neither Kamenev nor
    anyone else would dream of attributing or reducing it all
    to unprincipled demagogy.
On the contrary, there is an objective logic in factional
    struggles which inevitably leads even the best of men—if
    they persist in their mistaken attitude—into a state which
    differs little if at all from unprincipled demagogy. That is the
    lesson of the entire history of factional wars (for example, the
    alliance of the Vperyodists and the Mensheviks against the
    Bolsheviks[8]). That is why we must make a study not
    only of the nature of the disagreements in the abstract, but also
    of their concrete development and change at the various stages of
    the struggle. This development was summed up in the January 17
    discussion.[9] Neither the “shake-up”nor
    the “new production tasks”can any longer be advocated
    (because all the efficient and sensible ideas went into
    Rudzutak’s theses). The alternative then is to find what
    Lassalle called “the physical strength of mind”(and
    character) to admit the mistake, rectify it and turn over this
    page of the history of the R.C.P., or—to cling to the
    remaining allies, no matter who they are, and
    “ignore”the principles altogether. There remain only
    the adherents of “democracy”ad nauseam. And
    Bukharin is sliding down towards them and syndicalism.
While we are slowly absorbing what was sound in the
    “democratic”Workers’ Opposition, Bukharin has to
    cling to what is unsound. On January 17, Comrade
    Bumazhny, a prominent Tsektranite, or Trotskyite, expressed his
    readiness to accept Bukharin’s syndicalist proposals. The
    “Sapronovites”have gone so far as to insist in the
    same thesis (3) on a “profound crisis”and a
    “bureaucratic necrosis”of the trade unions, while
    proposing, as being “absolutely”necessary, the
    “extension of the trade unions’ rights in
    production”. . . probably because of their
    “bureaucratic necrosis"? Can this group be taken seriously?
    They had heard the talk about the role of the trade unions in
    production, and wishing to outshout the others, blurted out:
    “extension of rights”on the occasion of
    “bureaucratic necrosis”.You need read no more than the
    first few lines of their “practical”proposals:
    “The presidium of the Supreme Economic Council shall be
    nominated by the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and
    confirmed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.”And
    what is their democratic position in “principle"?
    Listen to this (thesis 2): “They [Zinoviev and Trotsky][10] in fact express two trends within the
    same group of ex-militarisers of the economy.”
Taken seriously, this is Menshevism and
    Socialist-Revolutionarism at their worst. But Sapronov, Osinsky
    and Co. should not be taken seriously, when, before every Party
    congress (“every blessed time on this very same
    spot”), these, I believe, superlative workers have a sort of
    paroxysmal seizure and try to outshout the others (the
    “champion shouter”faction) and solemnly make a hash of
    things. The “Ignatovites”try to keep up with the
    “Sapronovites”.It is, of course, quite permissible
    (specially before a congress) for various groups to form blocs
    (and also to go vote chasing). But this should he done within the
    framework of communism (and not syndicalism) and in such a way as
    to avoid being ridiculous. Who is the highest bidder? Promisers of
    more “rights”to non-Party people, unite on the
    occasion of the congress of the Russian Communist Party! . . .
Our platform up to now has been: Do not defend but rectify the
    bureaucratic excesses. The fight against bureaucracy is a long and
    arduous one. Excesses can and must be rectified at once. It is not
    those who point out harmful excesses and strive to rectify them
    but those who resist rectificatien that undermine the prestige of
    the military workers and appointees. Such were the excesses of
    certain Tsektranites who, however, will continue to be (and have
    been) valuable workers. There is no need to harass the trade
    unions by inventing disagreements with them, when they themselves
    have decided upon and accepted all that is new, business-like and
    practical in the tasks of the trade unions in production. On this
    basis, let us vigorously work together for practical results.
We have now added to our platform the following: We must combat
    the ideological discord and the unsound elements of the opposition
    who talk themselves into repudiating all “militarisation of
    industry”, and not only the “appointments
    method”, which has been the prevailing one up to now, but
    all “appointments”, that is, in the last analysis,
    repudiating the Party’s leading role in relation to
    the non-Party masses. We must combat the syndicalist deviation,
    which will kill the Party unless it is entirely cured of it.
The Entente[11] capitalists will surely try to take
    advantage of our Party’s malaise to mount another invasion,
    and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, to hatch plots and
    rebellions. We need have no fear of this because we shall all
    unite as one man, without being afraid to admit the malaise, but
    recognising that it demands from all of us a greater discipline,
    tenacity and firmness at every post. By the time the Tenth
    Congress of the R.C.P. meets in March, and after the Congress, the
    Party will not be weaker, but stronger.

    Entry

    At a joint meeting of the Party groups of the Eighth Congress of
    Soviets, the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the
    Moscow City Council of Trade Unions, an argument took place as to
    whether Y. E. Rudzutak was the author of the theses, The Tasks
    of the Trade Unions in Production. Lenin asked the Trade
    Union Central Council for documents on the origin of the
    theses. He was given an extract from record No. 44 of the minutes
    of November 1, and a covering note from S. A. Lozovsky. The
    extract proved that the Presidium had discussed and adopted
    Rudzutak’s theses as a basis and had instructed M. P. Tomsky
    and Rudiutak to put finishing touches to the theses. The note said
    this was done by Rudzutak alone. The Fifth All-Russia Conference
    of Trade Unions heard Rudzutak’s report, adopted his theses
    as a basis and elected a commission, consisting of
    G. V. Tsiperovich, A. A. Andreyev and Rudzutak, to edit them. They
    worked out several points and amplified the theses. 
Lenin sent the documents and Rudzutak’s
    theses to Pravda with his covering letter, which said:
    “I request the Editorial Board to publish Rudzutak’s
    theses, which were adopted by the Fifth All-Russia Trade Union
    Conference of November 2-6, 1920, and are indispensable to the
    discussion. I enclose additional material on the disagreements in
    Party circles concerning the origin of these theses.”The
    documents and Lenin’s Ietter were published in
    Pravda No. 13 on January 21, 1921.
[3]
    The “Appeal to the Party”was adopted at a discussion
    meeting of the representatives of Petrograd district Party
    organisations on January 3, 1921. On January 6, it was approved by
    a city meeting in People’s House which was attended by over
    4,000 Party members and candidates. Only 20 votes were cast
    against it. When it was discussed in the district Party
    organisations it had the support of 95-98 per cent of the
    membership. 
The Petrograd Bolsheviks supported Lenin and
    opposed Trotsky on the question of the trade unions’ role
    and tasks. They called the other Party organisations to follow
    Lenin and stressed the danger of Trotsky’s platform, for its
    realisation would have abolished the trade unions and undermined
    the dictatorship of the proletariat. Pravda No. 7 of
    January 13 published the Appeal and also the counter-statement of
    the Moscow Party Committee, which at that time took a
    “buffer”stand. In a resolution published in the same
    issue of Pravda the Moscow Committee said that it found
    “it absolutely impossible”to accept the Petrograd
    proposals; it said the Petrograd Party organisation’s stand
    showed its “extremely dangerous”tendency to become a
    special centre for preparing thc Party Congress; it did not
    condemn Trotsky’s establishment of a faction, thereby giving
    support to his anti-Party struggle.
[4]
Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. on the Role
    and Tasks of the Trade Unions was Lenin’s
    “Platform of 10”tabled before the Central Committee by
    a group of members of the C.C. and of thc Central
    Committee’s Trade Union Commission in opposition to the
    platforms of the anti-Party groups. It defined the role of the
    trade unions in the light of the new tasks connected with the end
    of the Civil War and transition to peaceful socialist
    construction: the trade unions, being a school of administration,
    a school of economic management, a school of communism, were
    chiefly to take part in government, train personnel for government
    bodies and economic agencies, and help tighten labour
    discipline. They were to base their work on education, persuasion
    and democratic practices. The Tenth Congress’s resolution on
    the role and tasks of the trade unions was based on the
    “Platform of 10”, which during the discussion had been
    supported by a majority of local Party organisations.
[5]
    An opportunist faction headed by M. S. Boguslavsky,
    A. Z. Kamensky, V. N. Maximovsky, N. Osinsky, Raphail
    (P. B. Farbman) and T. V. Sapronov. They first came out against
    Lenin’s line in Party and Soviet organisation at the Eighth
    Party Congress. At the Ninth Congress, they had their own
    rapporteurs on economic construction and organisational problems,
    but failed to find any support among the Bolsheviks. On many
    questions they had backing only from the Mensheviks.
They denied the Party’s leading role in
    the Soviets and trade unions and demanded freedom of factions and
    groups, and a merger of the Council of People’s Commissars
    and the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee,
    they opposed the subordination of local to central organs and
    wanted the Organisation Bureau of the Central Committee deprived
    of all say in political leadership, which would have split up the
    C.C.’s political and organisational unity. They opposed
    one-man management and the personal responsibility of managers in
    industry. In the Ukraine, they were against the “Poor
    Peasants’ Committees”which were instruments of the
    proletariat’s dictatorship in the countryside.
The group published its platform during the
    trade union discussion in 1920-21, but at the pre-Congress
    meetings it won only a handful of votes. At the Tenth Congress
    they withdrew their platform and allowed their members to vote
    freely. They continued to fight the Party on questions of
    organisation, on which V. N. Maximovsky delivered a
    co-report. After the Tenth Congress, only the leaders continued
    their anti-Party activity. In 1923, they joined the Trotskyites,
    and in 1926, formed the “Group of 15”headed by
    Sapronov and Smirnov, which was expelled from the Party by the
    Fifteenth Party Congross.
[6]Incidentally, the Party should demand that
    every “platform”be issued with the full signatures of
    all the comrades responsible for it. This demand is met by the
    “Ignatovites”and the “Sapronovites”but not
    by the “Trotskyites’’, the
    “Bukharinites”and the “Shlyapnikovites”,
    who refer to anonymous comrades allegedly responsible for their
    platforms—Lenin.
[7]
Ignatovites or “a group of activists of Moscow city
    districts”was an anti-Party anarcho-syndicalist group,
    headed by Y. N. Ignatov, during the trade union discussion of
    1920-21. Its activity was limited to the Moscow Party
    organisation, because it had no influence among the city’s
    workers and rank-and-file Party members. Before the Tenth Party
    Congress, it came out with two platforms: the current tasks of the
    trade unions, and Party organisation. The Ignatovites shared the
    anarcho-syndicalist views of the Workers’ Opposition; they
    set the trade unions in opposition to the Soviet state, denied the
    Party’s leadorship in socialist construction: opposed
    democratic centralism; demanded freedom of discussions, and wanted
    the Party membership to consist of workers only. They also
    demanded the handover of the administration of the economy to an
    organ elected by the All-Russia Trade Union Congress, but in
    contrast to the Workers’ Opposition, they wanted the organ
    confirmed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee as
    well. At the Tenth Congress, Ignatov was the official rapporteur
    of the Workers’ Opposition on problems of Party
    organisation. After the Congress, the group broke up.
[8]
    The reference is to the merger of the anti-Party Vperyod group
    (which consisted of otzovists, ultimatumists, and god-builders)
    with Menshevik liquidators and Trotskyites. They united after the
    Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the Russian
    Social-Democratic Labour Party to fight its decisions. They led a
    malicious campaign against ths Bolsheviks in an effort to split
    the workers’ revolutionary movement and weaken the
    proletarian Party. They formed a bloc demanding the
    “transformation”of the Party, which, in fact, implied
    its liquidation. The bloc, which had no principles to hold it
    together, was unstable and soon fell apart.
[9]
    The reference is to the trade union discussion at an enlarged
    session of the Moscow Party Committee together with delegates from
    Party organisations of Moscow city districts and uyezds on January
    17, 1921.
The session debated all the draft theses put
    forward by various groups during the discussion. In the
    preliminary voting, Lenin’s theses got 76 votes;
    Trotsky’s, 27; Bukharin’s, 5; Shlyapnikov’s, 4;
    Sapronov’s, 11; Ignatov’s, 25; Nogin’s, none,
    and Ryazanov’s, none. In the re-vote on the two main
    platforms, 84 votes were cast for Lenin’s theses, and 27,
    for Trotsky’s.
On January 18, the Moscow Party Committee
    adopted an appeal “To All Party Organisations”asking
    all Party members to give unanimous support to Lenin’s
    platform.

Report On The Role And Tasks  Of The Trade Unions
    Delivered On January 23 At A Meeting Of The Communist Group Of The
    Congress
The morbid character of the question of the role
    and tasks of the trade unions is due to the fact that it took the
    form of a factional struggle much too soon. This vast, boundless
    question should not have been taken up in such haste, as it was
    done here, and I put the chief blame on Comrade Trotsky for all
    this fumbling haste and precipitation. All of us have had occasion
    to submit inadequately prepared theses to the Central Committee
    and this is bound to go on because all our work is being done in a
    rush. This is not a big mistake, for all of us have had to act in
    haste. Taken by itself, it is a common mistake and is unavoidable
    because of the extremely difficult objective conditions. All the
    more reason, therefore, to treat factional, controversial issues
    with the utmost caution; for in such matters even not very
    hot-headed persons—something, I’m afraid, I cannot say
    about my opponent—may all too easily fall into this
    error. To illustrate my point, and to proceed at once to the heart
    of the matter, let me read you the chief of Trotsky’s
    theses.
In his pamphlet, towards the end of thesis No. 12, he writes:
    
 
      “We observe the fact that as economic tasks move into the
      foreground, many trade unionists take an ever more aggressive
      and uncompromising stand against the prospect of
      ’coalescence’ and the practical conclusions that
      follow from it. Among them we find Comrades Tomsky and
      Lozovsky.

      “What is more, many trade unionists, balking at the new
      tasks and methods, tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of
      corporative exclusiveness and hostility for the new men who are
      being drawn into the given branch of the economy, thereby
      actually fostering the survivals of craft-unionism among the
      organized workers.”
I could quote many similar passages from Trotsky’s
    pamphlet. I ask, by way of factional statement: Is it becoming for
    such an influential person, such a prominent leader, to attack his
    Party comrades in this way? I am sure that 99 per cent of the
    comrades, excepting those involved in the quarrel, will say that
    this should not be done.
I could well understand such a statement if Comrades Tomsky and
    Lozovsky were guilty, or could be suspected of being guilty, of,
    say, having flatly refused to sign the Brest Peace Treaty, or of
    having flatly opposed the war. The revolutionary interest is
    higher than formal democracy. But it is fundamentally wrong to
    approach the subject in such haste at the present moment. It
    won’t do at all. This point says that many trade unionists
    tend to cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility and
    exclusiveness. What does that mean? What sort of talk is this? Is
    it the right kind of language? Is it the right approach? I had
    earlier said that I might succeed in acting as a
    “buffer” and staying out of the discussion, because it
    is harmful to fight with Trotsky—it does the Republic, the
    Party, and all of us a lot of harm—but when this pamphlet
    came out, I felt I had to speak up.
Trotsky writes that “many trade unionists tend to
    cultivate a spirit of hostility for the new men”. How so? If
    that is true, those who are doing so should be named. Since this
    is not done, it is merely a shake-up, a bureaucratic approach to
    the business. Even if there is a spirit of hostility for the new
    men, one should not say a thing like that. Trotsky accuses
    Lozovsky and Tomsky of bureaucratic practices. I would say the
    reverse is true. It is no use reading any further because the
    approach has spoiled everything; he has poured a spoonful of tar
    into the honey, and no matter how much honey he may add now, the
    whole is already spoiled. 
Whose fault is it that many trade unionists tend to cultivate a
    spirit of hostility for the new men? Of course, a bufferite or a
    Tsektranite will say it is the trade unionists’.
The fact is that in this case idle fancy and invention have
    accumulated like the snowdrifts in the storm outside. But,
    comrades, we must sort things out and get at the substance. And it
    is that a spirit of hostility has been aroused among the masses by
    a number of tactless actions. My opponent asserts that certain
    people have been cultivating a spirit of hostility. This shows
    that the question is seen in the wrong light. We must sort things
    out. The All-Russia Conference was held in November, and that is
    where the “shake-up” catchword was launched. Trotsky
    was wrong in uttering it. Politically it is clear that such an
    approach will cause a split and bring down the dictatorship of the
    proletariat.
We must understand that trade unions are not government
    departments, like People’s Commissariats, but comprise the
    whole organised proletariat; that they are a special type of
    institution and cannot be approached in this way. And when there
    arose this question of a wrong approach, latent with the danger of
    a split, I said: “Don’t talk about any broad
    discussion for the time being; go to the commission and examine
    the matter carefully over there.” But the comrades said:
    “No, we can’t do that; it is a violation of
    democracy.” Comrade Bukharin went so far as to talk about
    the “sacred slogan of workers’ democracy”. Those
    are his very words. When I read that I nearly crossed
    myself. (Laughter.) I insist that a mistake always has a
    modest beginning and then grows up. Disagreements always start
    from small things. A slight cut is commonplace, but if it festers,
    it may result in a fatal illness. And this thing here is a
    festering wound. In November, there was talk about a shake-up; by
    December, it had become a big mistake.
The December Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee was
    against us. The majority sided with Trotsky and carried Trotsky
    and Bukharin’s resolution, which you must have read. But
    even the C.C. members who did not sympathise with us had to admit
    that the water transport workers had more right on their side than
    Tsektran. That is a fact. When I ask what Tsektran’s fault
    was, the answer is not that they had brought pressure to
    bear—that goes to their credit—but that they had
    allowed bureaucratic excesses.
But once you have realised that you had allowed excesses you
    ought to rectify them, instead of arguing against
    rectification. That is all there is to it. It will take decades to
    overcome the evils of bureaucracy. It is a very difficult
    struggle, and anyone who says we can rid ourselves of bureaucratic
    practices overnight by adopting anti-bureaucratic platforms is
    nothing but a quack with a bent for fine words. Bureaucratic
    excesses must be rectified right away. We must detect and rectify
    them without calling bad good, or black white. The workers and
    peasants realise that they have still to learn the art of
    government, but they are also very well aware that there are
    bureaucratic excesses, and it is a double fault to refuse to
    correct them. This must be done in good time, as the water
    transport workers have pointed out, and not only when your
    attention is called to it.
Even the best workers make mistakes. There are excellent
    workers in Tsektran, and we shall appoint them, and correct their
    bureaucratic excesses. Comrade Trotsky says that Comrades Tomsky
    and Lozovsky—trade unionists both—are guilty of
    cultivating in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new
    men. But this is monstrous. Only someone in the lunatic fringe can
    say a thing like that.
This haste leads to arguments, platforms and accusations, and
    eventually creates the impression that everything is rotten.
You know when people fall out it only takes them a couple of
    days to start abusing each other’s relatives down to the
    tenth generation. You ask: “What are you quarrelling
    over?” “Oh, his aunt was this, and his grandfather was
    that.” “I don’t mean now; how did the whole
    thing start?” It turns out that in the course of two days a
    heap of disagreements has piled up.
Tsektran has allowed excesses in a number of cases, and these
    were harmful and unnecessary bureaucratic excesses. People are
    liable to allow excesses everywhere. There are departments with a
    staff of 30,000 in Moscow alone. That is no joke. There’s
    something to be corrected, there’s a wall to be
    scaled. There must be no fear, no thought of causing offence or
    dissension. To start a factional struggle and accuse Tomsky of
    cultivating among the masses a spirit of hostility for the
    Tsektranites is utterly to distort the facts, absolutely to spoil
    all the work, and entirely to damage all relations with the trade
    unions. But the trade unions embrace the whole proletariat. If
    this thing is persisted in and voted on by platforms, it will lead
    to the downfall of the Soviet power.
If the Party falls out with the trade unions, the fault lies
    with the Party, and this spells certain doom for the Soviet
    power. We have no other mainstay but the millions of proletarians,
    who may not be class conscious, are often ignorant, backward and
    illiterate, but who, being proletarians, follow their own
    Party. For twenty years they have regarded this Party as their
    own. Next comes a class which is not ours, which may side with us,
    if we are wise and if we pursue a correct policy within our own
    class. We have now reached the supreme moment of our revolution:
    we have roused the proletarian masses and the masses of poor
    peasants in the rural areas to give us their conscious support. No
    revolution has ever done this before. There is no class that can
    overthrow us: the majority of the proletarians and the rural poor
    are behind us. Nothing can ruin us but our own mistakes. This
    “but” is the whole point. If we cause a split, for
    which we are to blame, everything will collapse because the trade
    unions are not only an official institution, but also the source
    of all our power. They are the class which the economics of
    capitalism has converted into the economic amalgamator, and which
    through its industry brings together millions of scattered
    peasants. That is why one proletarian has more strength than 200
    peasants.
That is just why Trotsky’s whole approach is wrong. I
    could have analysed any one of his theses, but it would take me
    hours, and you would all be bored to death. Every thesis reveals
    the same thoroughly wrong approach: “Many trade unionists
    tend to cultivate a spirit of hostility.” There is a spirit
    of hostility for us among the trade union rank and file because of
    our mistakes, and the bureaucratic practices up on top, including
    myself, because it was I who appointed Glavpolitput. What is to be
    done? Are things to be set right? We must correct Tsektran’s
    excesses, once we realise that we are a solid workers’
    party, with a firm footing, and a head on its shoulders. We are
    not renouncing either the method of appointment, or the
    dictatorship. This will not be tolerated by workers with a twenty
    years’ schooling in Russia. If we condone this mistakes we
    shall surely be brought down. It is a mistake, and that is the
    root of the matter.
Trotsky says Lozovsky and Tomsky are balking at the new
    tasks. To prove this will put a new face on the matter. What are
    the new tasks?
Here we are told: “production atmosphere”,
    “industrial democracy” and “role in
    production”. I said, at the very outset, in the December 30
    discussion, that that was nothing but words, which the workers did
    not understand, and that it was all part of the task of production
    propaganda. We are not renouncing the dictatorship, or one-man
    management; these remain, I will support them, but I refuse to
    defend excesses and stupidity. “Production atmosphere”
    is a funny phrase that will make the workers laugh. Saying it more
    simply and clearly is all part of production propaganda. But a
    special institution has been set up for the purpose.
About enhancing the role of the trade unions in production, I
    replied on December 30 and in the press, and said that we have
    Comrade Rudzutak’s resolution, which was adopted at the
    Conference on November 5. Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin said that
    Tsektran had drafted this resolution. Although this has been
    refuted, let me ask: if they had drafted it, who, in that case, is
    kicking? The trade unions adopted it and Tsektran drafted it. Well
    and good. There’s no point, therefore, in quarrelling like
    children and raising factional disagreements. Has Comrade Trotsky
    brought up any new tasks? No, he hasn’t. The fact is that
    his new points are all worse than the old ones. Comrade Trotsky is
    campaigning to get the Party to condemn those who are balking at
    new tasks, and Tomsky and Lozovsky have been named as the greatest
    sinners.
Rudzutak’s resolution is couched in clearer and simpler
    language, and has nothing in it like “production
    atmosphere” or “industrial democracy”. It says
    clearly that every trade union member must be aware of the vital
    necessity of increasing productivity in the country. It is put in
    simple and intelligible language. All this is stated better than
    in Trotsky’s theses, and more fully, because bonuses in kind
    and disciplinary courts have been added. Without the latter, all
    this talk of getting the transport system going and improving
    things is humbug. Let us set up commissions and disciplinary
    courts. In this matter Tsektran has allowed excesses. We propose
    calling a spade a spade: it is no use covering up excesses with
    new tasks; they must be corrected. We have no intention of
    renouncing coercion. No sober-minded worker would go so far as to
    say that we could now dispense with coercion, or that we could
    dissolve the trade unions, or let them have the whole of
    industry. I can imagine Comrade Shlyapnikov blurting out a thing
    like that.
In the whole of his speech there is one excellent passage on
    the experience of the Sormovo Works, where, he said, absenteeism
    was reduced by 30 per cent. This is said to be true. But I am a
    suspicious sort, I suggest that a commission be sent there to
    investigate and make a comparison of Nizhni-Novgorod and
    Petrograd. There is no need to have a meeting about this: it can
    all be done in commission. Trotsky says that there is an attempt
    to prevent coalescence, but that is nonsense. He says we must go
    forward. Indeed, if the engine is good; but if it isn’t, we
    must put it into reverse. The Party will benefit from this,
    because we must study experience.
Production is at a standstill, but some people have been busy
    producing bad theses. This question requires study and
    experience. You are trade unionists and miners who are doing their
    job. Now since you have taken up this question, you must inquire,
    demand figures, verify them over and over again—don’t
    take any statements for granted—and when you have done that,
    let us know the result. If it is good, then go on; if it is bad,
    go back. This means work, not talk. All this should have been done
    at Party meetings.
At the Eighth Congress of Soviets, I said that we ought to have
    less politics. When I said that I thought we would have no more
    political mistakes, but here we are, three years after the Soviet
    revolution, talking about syndicalism. This is a shame. If I had
    been told six months ago that I would be writing about
    syndicalism, I would have said that I preferred to write about the
    Donbas. Now we are being distracted, and the Party is being
    dragged back. A small mistake is growing into a big one. That is
    where Comrade Shlyapnikov comes in. Point 16 of Comrade
    Trotsky’s theses gives a correct definition of
    Shlyapnikov’s mistake.
In an effort to act the buffer, Bukharin clutched at
    Shlyapnikov, but it would have been better for him to clutch at a
    straw. He promises the unions mandatory nominations, which means
    they are to have the final say in appointments. But that is
    exactly what Shlyapnikov is saying. Marxists have been combating
    syndicalism all over the world. We have been fighting in the Party
    for over twenty years, and we have given the workers visual proof
    that the Party is a special kind of thing which needs
    forward-looking men prepared for sacrifice; that it does make
    mistakes, but corrects them; that it guides and selects men who
    know the way and the obstacles before us. It does not deceive the
    workers. It never makes promises that cannot be kept. And if you
    skip the trade unions you will make a hash of everything we have
    achieved over the past three years. Comrade Bukharin, with whom I
    discussed this mistake, said. “Comrade Lenin, you are
    picking on us.”
I take mandatory nominations to mean that they will be made
    under the direction of the Party’s Central Committee. But in
    that case, what are the rights we are giving them? There will then
    be no chance of having a bloc. The workers and the peasants are
    two distinct classes. Let us talk about vesting the rights in the
    trade unions when electricity has spread over the whole
    country—if we manage to achieve this in twenty years it will
    be incredibly quick work, for it cannot be done quickly. To talk
    about it before then will be deceiving the workers. The
    dictatorship of the proletariat is the most stable thing in the
    world because it has won confidence by its deeds, and because the
    Party took great care to prevent diffusion.
What does that mean?
Does every worker know how to run the state? People working in
    the practical sphere know that this is not true, that millions of
    our organised workers are going through what we always said the
    trade unions were, namely, a school of communism and
    administration. When they have attended this school for a number
    of years they will have learned to administer, but the going is
    slow. We have not even abolished illiteracy. We know that workers
    in touch with peasants are liable to fall for non-proletarian
    slogans. How many of the workers have been engaged in government?
    A few thousand throughout Russia and no more. If we say that it is
    not the Party but the trade unions that put up the candidates and
    administrate, it may sound very democratic and might help us to
    catch a few votes, but not for long. It will be fatal for the
    dictatorship of the proletariat.
Read the decision of the Second Congress of the Comintern. [2] Its resolutions and decisions have
    gone round the world. The recent Socialist Congress in France
    revealed that we have won a majority in a country where chauvinism
    is most virulent; we have split the Party and ejected the corrupt
    leaders, and we did this in opposition to the syndicalists.[3] And all the best workers and leaders
    there have adopted our theory. Even
    syndicalists—revolutionary syndicalists—are siding
    with us all over the world. I myself have met American
    syndicalists who, after a visit to this country, say:
    “Indeed, you cannot lead the proletariat without a
    Party.” You all know that this is a fact. And it is quite
    improper for the proletariat to rush into the arms of syndicalism
    and talk about mandatory nominations to “all-Russia
    producers’ congresses”. This is dangerous and
    jeopardizes the Party’s guiding role. Only a very small
    percentage of the workers in the country are now organised. The
    majority of the peasants will follow the Party because its policy
    is correct, and because, during the Brest peace ordeal, it was
    capable of making temporary sacrifices and retreats, which was the
    right thing to do. Are we to throw all this away? Was it all a
    windfall? No, it was all won by the Party in decades of hard
    work. Everybody believes the word of the Bolsheviks, who have had
    twenty years of Party training.
To govern you need an army of steeled revolutionary
    Communists. We have it, and it is called the Party. All this
    syndicalist nonsense about mandatory nominations of producers must
    go into the wastepaper basket. To proceed on those lines would
    mean thrusting the Party aside and making the dictatorship of the
    proletariat in Russia impossible. This is the view I believe it to
    be my Party duty to put to you. It is, in my opinion, enunciated
    in the form of practical propositions in the platform called
    Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. and
    signed by Lenin, Zinoviev, Tomsky, Rudzutak, Kalinin, Kamenev,
    Lozovsky, Petrovsky, Sergeyev and Stalin. Lozovsky, who is not a
    member of the Central Committee, was included because he was on
    the trade union commission from which Shlyapnikov and Lutovinov,
    unfortunately, resigned. It is up to the workers to decide whether
    Shlyapnikov was right in resigning, and he will be censured, if he
    was wrong. I am convinced that all class-conscious workers will
    accept this platform and that the present disagreements in our
    Party will be confined to fever at the top. I am sure the workers
    will put them right, remain at their posts, maintain Party
    discipline and join in an efficient but careful drive to increase
    production and secure full victory for our cause. (Prolonged
    applause.) 


Speech Closing The Discussion Delivered At A
    Meeting Of The Communist  Group Of The Congress  January 24
Comrades, I should like to begin by speaking about
    who is trying to intimidate whom, and about Comrade Shlyapnikov,
    who has tried hard to scare us. Everyone here said Lenin was
    trying to raise the bogey of syndicalism. This is ridiculous
    because the very idea of using syndicalism as a bogey is
    ridiculous. I think we ought to start with our programmes, by
    reading the Programme of the Communist Party to see what it
    says. Comrades Trotsky and Shlyapnikov referred to the same
    passage which happens to be its Paragraph 5. Let me read it to you
    in full:

      “5. The organisational apparatus of socialised industry
      should rely chiefly on the trade unions, which must to an ever
      increasing degree divest themselves of the narrow craft-union
      spirit and become large industrial associations, embracing the
      majority, and eventually all of the workers in the given branch
      of industry.”
Comrade Shlyapnikov quoted this passage in his speech. But, if
    the figures were correct, those who were managing the
    organisations constituted 60 per cent, and these consisted of
    workers. Furthermore, when reference is made to the Programme,
    this should be done properly, bearing in mind that Party members
    know it thoroughly, and do not confine themselves to reading one
    extract, as Trotsky and Shlyapnikov have done. Comrades, there is
    much history to show that the workers cannot organise otherwise
    than by industries. That is why the idea of industrial unionism
    has been adopted all over the world. That is for the time being,
    of course. There is talk about the need to cast off the narrow
    craft-union spirit. I ask you, has this been done to, say, a
    tenth? Of course, not, is the sincere answer. Why forget this? 
 
    
Who is it who says to the unions: “You have not yet
    divested yourselves of the narrow craft-union spirit, and must get
    on with it”? It is the R.C.P. which does this in its
    Programme. Read it. To depart from this is to abandon the
    Programme for syndicalism. Despite the hints at Lenin’s
    “intimidation”, the Programme is still there. You
    depart from it by quoting the first part and forgetting the
    second. In which direction? Towards syndicalism. Let me read
    further:
“The trade unions being, on the strength of
    the laws of the Soviet Republic and established practice,
    participants in all the local and central organs of industrial
    management, should eventually arrive at a de facto
    concentration in their hands of the whole administration of the
    whole national economy, as a single economic entity.”
 Everyone makes references to this paragraph. What does it say?
    Something that is absolutely indisputable: “should
    eventually arrive.” It does not say that they are
    arriving. It does not contain the exaggeration which, once made,
    reduces the whole to an absurdity. It says, “should
    eventually arrive”. Arrive where? At a de facto
    concentration and administration. When are you due to arrive at
    this point? This calls for education, and it must be so organised
    as to teach everyone the art of administration. Now can you say,
    with a clear conscience, that the trade unions are able to fill
    any number of executive posts with suitable men at any time? After
    all, it is not six million, but sixty thousand or, say, a hundred
    thousand men that you need to fill all the executive posts. Can
    they nominate this number? No, they cannot—not yet—as
    anyone will say who is not chasing after formulas and theses and
    is not misled by the loudest voices. Years of educational work lie
    ahead for the Party, ranging from the abolition of illiteracy to
    the whole round of Party work in the trade unions. An enormous
    amount of work must be done in the trade unions to achieve this
    properly. This is exactly what it- says: “should eventually
    arrive at a de facto concentration in their hands of the
    whole administration of the whole national economy”. It does
    not say branches of industry, as Trotsky does in his theses. One
    of his first theses quotes the Programme correctly, but another
    one says: organisation of industry. I’m afraid that is no
    way to quote. When you are writing some theses and you want to
    quote the Programme, you must read it to the end. Anyone who takes
    the trouble to read this Paragraph 5 right through and give it ten
    minutes’ thought will see that Shlyapnikov has departed from
    the Programme, and that Trotsky has leaped over it. Let’s
    read Paragraph 5 to the end: 
 “The trade unions, ensuring in this way
    indissoluble ties between the central state administration, the
    national economy and the broad masses of working people, should
    draw the latter into direct economic management on the widest
    possible scale. At the same time, the participation of the trade
    unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the
    broad masses into this work are the principal means of combating
    the bureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the Soviet
    power and making possible the establishment of truly popular
    control over the results of production.”
You find that you must first achieve de facto
    concentration. But what are you ensuring now? First, there are the
    ties within the central state administration. This is a huge
    machine. You have not yet taught us to master it. And so, you must
    ensure ties between the central state administration—that
    ’s one; national economy—that’s two; and the
    masses—that’s three. Have we got those ties? Are the
    trade unions capable of administration? Anybody over thirty years
    of age with some little practical experience of Soviet
    organisation will laugh at this. Read the following: 
“At the same time, the participation of the
    trade unions in economic management and their activity in drawing
    the broad masses into this work are the principal means of
    combating the bureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the
    Soviet power and making possible the establishment of truly
    popular control over the results of production.” 

    
First, there is need to create ties between the central state
    organisations. We have no intention of concealing this malaise,
    and our Programme says: ensure ties with the masses, and ensure
    the participation of the trade unions in economic
    management. There are no loud words in this. When you have done
    that in such a way as to reduce absenteeism by, say, 3 per
    cent—let alone 30—we shall say: you have done a fine
    job. Our present Programme says: “. . . the participation of
    the trade unions in economic management and their activity in
    drawing the broad masses into this work. . . .” It does not
    contain a single promise or a single loud word; nor does it say
    anything about your doing the electing. It does not resort to
    demagogy, but says that there is an ignorant, backward mass, that
    there are trade unions, which are so strong that they are leading
    the whole of the peasantry, and which themselves follow the lead
    of the Party, with a twenty-year schooling in the fight against
    tsarism. No country has gone through what Russia has, and that is
    the secret of our strength. Why is this regarded as a miracle?
    Because in a peasant country, only the trade unions can provide
    the economic bonds to unite millions of scattered farms, if this
    mass of six million has faith in its Party, and continues to
    follow it as it had hitherto. That is the secret of our strength,
    and the way it works is a political question. How can a minority
    govern a huge peasant country, and why are we so composed? After
    our three years’ experience, there is no external or
    internal force that can break us. Provided we do not make any
    extra stupid mistakes leading to splits, we shall retain our
    positions; otherwise everything will go to the dogs. That is why,
    when Comrade Shlyapnikov says in his platform: 

    “The All-Russia Congress of Producers shall
    elect a body to administer the whole national economy,”

    I say: read the whole of Paragraph 5 of our Programme, which I
    have read out to you, and you will see that there is no attempt at
    intimidation either on Lenin’s or anyone else’s
    part.
Shlyapnikov concluded his speech by saying: “We must
    eliminate bureaucratic methods in government and the national
    economy.” I say this is demagogy. We have had this question
    of bureaucratic practices on the agenda since last July. After the
    Ninth Congress of the R.C.P. last July, Preobrazhensky also asked:
    Are we not suffering from bureaucratic excesses? Watch out! In
    August, the Central Committee endorsed Zinoviev’s letter:
    Combat the evils of bureaucracy. The Party Conference met in
    September, and endorsed it. So, after all, it was not Lenin who
    invented some new path, as Trotsky says, but the Party which said:
    “Watch out: there’s a new malaise.”
    Preobrazhensky raised this question in July; we had
    Zinoviev’s letter in August; there was the Party Conference
    in September and we had a long report on bureaucratic practices at
    the Congress of Soviets in December. The malaise is there. In our
    1919 Programme we wrote that bureaucratic practices
    existed. Whoever comes out and demands a stop to bureaucratic
    practices is a demagogue. When you are called upon to “put a
    stop to bureaucratic practices”, it is demagogy. It is
    nonsense. We shall be fighting the evils of bureaucracy for many
    years to come, and whoever thinks otherwise is playing demagogue
    and cheating, because overcoming the evils of bureaucracy requires
    hundreds of measures, wholesale literacy, culture and
    participation in the activity of the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection.[4] Shlyapnikov has been
    People’s Commissar for Labour and People’s Commissar
    for Trade and Industry. Has he put a stop to bureaucratic
    practices? Kiselyov has been on the Central Board of the Textile
    Industry. Has he put a stop to the evils of
    bureaucracy?
Let me say this once again: We shall have grown up when all our
    congresses resolve themselves into sections and marshal the facts
    about coalescence among the millers and the Donbas miners. But
    writing a string of useless platforms shows up our poor economic
    leadership. I repeat that nothing can break us, neither external
    nor internal forces, if we do not lead things up to a split. I say
    that Tsektran is more than a bludgeon, but exaggerating this has
    led up to a split. Anyone can be guilty of an excess of
    bureaucratic practices, and the Central Committee is aware of it,
    and is responsible for it. In this respect, Comrade
    Trotsky’s mistake lies in that he drew up his theses in the
    wrong spirit. They are all couched in terms of a shake-up, and
    they have all led to a split in the union. It is not a matter of
    giving Trotsky bad marks—we are not schoolchildren and have
    no use for marks—but we must say that his theses are wrong
    in content and must therefore be rejected.

    The Congress was held in Moscow’s Trade Union House from
    January 25 to February 2, 1921. It was attended by 341 delegates,
    of whom 295 had voice and vote, and 46, voice only. They
    represented more than 332,000 members of the Miners’ Trade
    Union. Lenin and Kalinin were Honorary Chairmen.
 The items on its agenda were: report of the
    Miners’ Trade Union Central Committee; reports of the Mining
    Council and its departments; fuel supply problems; tasks of the
    trade union; organisation of production; wage rates; organisation;
    cultural and educational work; labour safety measures;
    international ties; concessions, and election of a new Trade Union
    Central Committee. The Congress decided to issue an appeal for
    unity to the organised workers of all countries. 
 Prior to the Congress, on January 22-24, the
    R.C.P.(B.) group had four meetings to discuss the trade
    unions’ role and tasks, which were addressed by Lenin,
    Trotsky and Shlyapnikov. The absolute majority of the group
    supported Lenin’s platform, which won 137 votes;
    Shlyapnikov’s received 61, and Trotsky’s, 8.
The Congress helped to solve the fuel crisis
    and work out production programmes for the mining industry.

    Second Congress of the Communist International, “On the Role
    of the Communist Party in the Proletarian Revolution”. See
    Vtoroi kongress Kominterna (Second Congress of the
    Communist International, Moscow, 1934, pp. 640-46).
[3]
    The reference is to the Eighteenth Congress of the French
    Socialist Party in Tours, December 25-30, 1920. It was attended by
    285 delegates with 4,575 mandates. The main question on the agenda
    was the Party’s affiliation to the Communist
    International. The issue was a foregone conclusion because at the
    federation congresses held before the national Congress, an
    absolute majority had voted for immediate entry into the Third
    International on the basis of the 21 conditions. Still there was a
    bitter struggle at the Congress between supporters of affiliation
    (Paul Vaillant Couturier, Marcel Cachin, Daniel Renoult) and its
    opponents (Leon Blum, Jean Longuet, Marcel Sembat and
    others). Clara Zetkin, who had come to the Congress in spite of
    the French Government’s ban and police harassment, delivered
    a brilliant speech and conveyed greetings on behalf of the
    Communist International. 
After a four-day debate, the delegates voted
    for affiliation by 3,208 mandates, or more than 70 per cent. 
The majority set up the Communist Party of
    France, which was finally formed in May 1921. The minority, led by
    Leon Blum, aimed at splitting the workers’ movement, and
    walked out of the Congress, forming their own reformist party,
    which retained the old name of the French Socialist Party.
[4]
    The Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) was
    set up in February 1920 on Lenin’s initiative, on the basis
    of the reorganised People’s Commissariat for State Control
    which had been formed in the early months of the Soviet
    power. 
Lenin attached great importance to control and
    verification from top to bottom. He worked out in detail the
    principles of organising control in the Soviet state, kept an eye
    on Rabkrin’s activity, criticised its shortcomings and did
    his best to make it more efficient. In his last articles,
    “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection” and “Better Fewer but
    Better”, Lenin outlined a plan for reorganising Rabkrin. To
    merge Party and state control and to enlist more workers and
    peasants in its activity were the basic principles of
    Lenin’s plan, and this he regarded as the source of the
    Party’s and the state’s inexhaustible strength. On
    Lenin’s instructions, the Party’s Twelfth Congress set
    up a joint organ, the Central Control Commission and the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, to exercise Party
    and state control. 
 During Stalin’s personality cult, these
    principles were violated, and Lenin’s system of control was
    substituted by a bureaucratic apparatus. In 1934, Stalin secured a
    decision to set up two control centres—the Central
    Committee’s Party Control Commission, and the
    Government’s Soviet Control Commission. The People’s
    Commissariat for State Control of the U.S.S.R. was set up in 1940;
    it was reorganised into the Ministry for State Control in 1946,
    and later, into the Commission for State Control. Pursuant to a
    decision of the Twenty-Second Congress, which stressed the
    importance of Party, state and mass control, the November 1962
    Central Committee Plenary Meeting deemed it necessary to
    reorganise the system of control on Leninist principles. The Party
    and State Control Committee of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U. and the
    Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. was set up under a decision
    of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U., the Presidium of the
    Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers on November 27,
    1962.

The Party discussion and the factional struggle,
    which is of a type that occurs before a congress—before and
    in connection with the impending elections to the Tenth Congress
    of the R.C.P.—are waxing hot. The first factional
    pronouncement, namely, the one made by Comrade Trotsky on behalf
    of “a number of responsible workers” in his
    “platform pamphlet” (The Role and Tasks of the
    Trade Unions, with a preface dated December 25, 1920), was
    followed by a sharp pronouncement (the reader will see from what
    follows that it was deservedly sharp) by the Petrograd
    organisation of the R.C.P. (“Appeal to the Party”,
    published in Petrogradskaya Pravda [2] on
    January 6, 1921, and in the Party’s Central Organ, the
    Moscow Pravda, on January 13, 1921). The Moscow Committee
    then came out against the Petrograd organisation (in the same
    issue of Pravda ). Then appeared a verbatim report,
    published by the bureau of the R.C.P. group of the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions, of the discussion that took place
    on December 30, 1920, at a very large and important Party meeting,
    namely, that of the R.C.P. group at the Eighth Congress of
    Soviets. It is entitled The Role of the Trade Unions in
    Production (with a preface dated January 6, 1921). This, of
    course, is by no means all of the discussion material. Party
    meetings to discuss these issues are being held almost
    everywhere. On December 30, 1920, I spoke at a meeting in
    conditions in which, as I put it then, I “departed from the
    rules of procedure”, i.e., in conditions in which I could
    not take part in the discussion or hear the preceding and
    subsequent speakers. I shall now try to make amends and express
    myself in a more “orderly” fashion.
The Danger Of Factional 
      Pronouncements To The Party
Is Comrade Trotsky’s pamphlet The Role and Tasks of
    the Trade Unions a factional pronouncement? Irrespective of
    its content, is there any danger to the Party in a pronouncement
    of this kind? Attempts to hush up this question are a particularly
    favourite exercise with the members of the Moscow Committee (with
    the exception of Comrade Trotsky, of course), who see the
    factionalism of the Petrograd comrades, and with Comrade Bukharin,
    who, however, felt obliged, on December 30, 1920, to make the
    following statement on behalf of the “buffer
    group”:
  “. . . when a train seems to be heading
    for a crash, a buffer is not a bad thing at all” (report of
    the December 30,1920 discussion, p. 45). 
    
So there is some danger of a crash. Can we conceive of
    intelligent members of the Party being indifferent to the question
    of how, where and when this danger arose?
Trotsky’s pamphlet opens with the statement that
    “it is the fruit of collective work”, that “a
    number of responsible workers, particularly trade unionists
    (members of the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Council of
    Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’
    Union, Tsektran and others)” took part in compiling it, and
    that it is a “platform pamphlet”. At the end of thesis
    4 we read that “the forthcoming Party Congress will have to
    choose [Trotsky’s italics] between the two trends
    within the trade union movement”.
If this is not the formation of a faction by a member of the
    Central Committee, if this does not mean “heading for a
    crash”, then let Comrade Bukharin, or anyone of his
    fellow-thinkers, explain to the Party any other possible meaning
    of the words “factionalism “, and the Party
    “seems to be heading for a crash”. Who can be more
    purblind than men wishing to play the “buffer” and
    closing their eyes to such a “danger of a
    crash”?
Just imagine: after the Central Committee had spent two plenary
    meetings (November 9 and December 7) in an unprecedentedly long,
    detailed and heated discussion of Comrade Trotsky’s original
    draft theses and of the entire trade union policy that he
    advocates for the Party, one member of the Central Committee,
    one out of nineteen, forms a group outside the Central
    Committee and presents its “collective work” as a
    “platform”, inviting the Party Congress “to
    choose between two trends”! This, incidentally,
    quite apart from the fact that Comrade Trotsky’s
    announcement of two and only two trends on December 25, 1920,
    despite Bukharin’s coming out as a “buffer” on
    November 9, is a glaring exposure of the Bukharin group’s
    true role as abettors of the worst and most harmful sort of
    factionalism. But I ask any Party member: Don’t you find
    this attack and insistence upon’choosing” between two
    trends in the trade union movement rather sudden? What is there
    for us to do but stare in astonishment at the fact that after
    three years of the proletarian dictatorship even one Party member
    can be found to “attack” the two trends issue in
    this way ?
Nor is that all. Look at the factional attacks in which this
    pamphlet abounds. In the very first thesis we find a threatening
    “gesture” at “certain workers in the trade union
    movement” who are thrown “back to trade-unionism, pure
    and simple, which the Party repudiated in principle long ago
    “ (evidently the Party is represented by only one member of
    the Central Committee’s nineteen). Thesis 8 grandiloquently
    condemns “the craft conservatism prevalent among the top
    trade union functionaries” (note the truly bureaucratic
    concentration of attention on the “top”!). Thesis 11
    opens with the astonishingly tactful, conclusive and business-like
    (what is the most polite word for it?) “hint” that the
    “majority of the trade unionists . . . give only formal,
    that is, verbal, recognition” to the resolutions of
    the Party’s Ninth Congress.
We find that we have some very authoritative judges before us
    who say the majority (!) of the trade unionists give only
    verbal recognition to the Party’s decisions.

    

      Thesis 12 reads:
 “. . . many trade unionists take an ever
      more aggressive and uncompromising stand against the prospect
      of’coalescence’. . . . Among them we find Comrades
      Tomsky and Lozovsky.
 “What is more, many trade unionists,
    balking at the new tasks, and methods, tend to cultivate in their
    midst a spirit of corporative exclusiveness and hostility for the
    new men who are being drawn into the given branch of the economy,
    thereby actually fostering the survivals of craft-unionism among
    the organised workers.”
Let the reader go over these arguments carefully and ponder
    them. They simply abound in “gems”. Firstly, the
    pronouncement must be assessed from the standpoint of
    factionalism! Imagine what Trotsky would have said, and how he
    would have said it, if Tomsky had published a platform accusing
    Trotsky and “many” military workers of cultivating the
    spirit of bureaucracy, fostering the survivals of savagery,
    etc. What is the “role” of Bukharin, Preobrazhensky,
    Serebryakov and the others who fail to see—positively fail
    to note, utterly fail to note—the aggressiveness and
    factionalism of all this, and refuse to see how much more
    factional it is than the pronouncement of the Petrograd
    comrades?
Secondly, take a closer look at the approach to the subject:
    many trade unionists “tend to cultivate in their midst a
    spirit”. . . . This is an out-and-out bureaucratic
    approach. The whole point, you see, is not the level of
    development and living conditions of the masses in their millions,
    but the “spirit” which Tomsky and Lozovsky tend to
    cultivate “in their midst”.
Thirdly, Comrade Trotsky has unwittingly revealed the
    essence of the whole controversy which he and the
    Bukharin and Co. “buffer” have been evading and
    camouflaging with such care.
What is the point at issue? Is it the fact that many trade
    unionists are balking at the new tasks and methods and tend to
    cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new
    officials?
Or is it that the masses of organised workers are legitimately
    protesting and inevitably showing readiness to throw out the new
    officials who refuse to rectify the useless and harmful excesses
    of bureaucracy?
Is it that someone has refused to understand the “new
    tasks and methods”?
Or is it that someone is making a clumsy attempt to cover up
    his defence of certain useless and harmful excesses of bureaucracy
    with a lot of talk about new tasks and methods?
It is this essence of the dispute that the reader
    should bear in mind. 
    
Formal Democracy and the Revolutionary
    Interest
“Workers’ democracy is free from fetishes”,
    Comrade Trotsky writes in his theses, which are the “fruit
    of collective work”. “Its sole consideration is the
    revolutionary interest” (thesis 23).
Comrade Trotsky’s theses have landed him in a mess. That
    part of them which is correct is not new and, what is more, turns
    against him. That which is new is all wrong.
I have written out Comrade Trotsky’s correct
    propositions. They turn against him not only on the point in
    thesis 23 (Glavpolitput) but on the others as well.
Under the rules of formal democracy, Trotsky had a
    right to come out with a factional platform even against the
    whole of the Central Committee. That is indisputable. What is also
    indisputable is that the Central Committee had endorsed this
    formal right by its decision on freedom of discussion adopted on
    December 24, 1920. Bukharin, the buffer, recognises this formal
    right for Trotsky, but not for the Petrograd organisation,
    probably because on December 30, 1920, he talked himself into
    “the sacred slogan of workers’ democracy”
    (verbatim report, p. 45). . . .
Well, and what about the revolutionary interest?
Will any serious-minded person who is not blinded by the
    factional egotism of Tsektran” or of the
    “buffer” faction, will anyone in his right mind say
    that such a pronouncement on the trade union issue by
    such a prominent leader as Trotsky does promote the
    revolutionary interest ?
Can it be denied that, even if Trotsky’s “new tasks
    and methods” were as sound as they are in fact unsound (of
    which later), his very approach would be damaging to himself, the
    Party, the trade union movement, the training of millions of trade
    union members and the Republic?
It looks as if the kind Bukharin and his group call them selves
    a “buffer” because they have firmly decided not to
    think about the obligations this title imposes upon
    them. 
The Political Danger Of Splits In The Trade Union
    Movement
Everyone knows that big disagreements sometimes grow out of
    minute differences, which may at first appear to be altogether
    insignificant. A slight cut or scratch, of the kind everyone has
    had scores of in the course of his life, may become very dangerous
    and even fatal if it festers and if blood
    poisoning sets in. This may happen in any kind of conflict, even a
    purely personal one. This also happens in politics.
Any difference, even an insignificant one, may become
    politically dangerous if it has a chance to grow into a split, and
    I mean the kind of split that will shake and destroy the whole
    political edifice, or lead, to use Comrade Bukharin’s
    simile, to a crash.
Clearly, in a country under the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, a split in the ranks of the proletariat, or between
    the proletarian party and the mass of the proletariat, is not just
    dangerous; it is extremely dangerous, especially when the
    proletariat constitutes a small minority of the population. And
    splits in the trade union movement (which, as I tried hard to
    emphasise in my speech on December 30, 1920, is a movement of the
    almost completely organised proletariat) mean precisely splits in
    the mass of the proletariat.
That is why, when the whole thing started at the Fifth
    All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions on November 2-6, 1920 (and
    that is exactly where it did start), and when right after the
    Conference—no, I am mistaken, during that
    Conference—Comrade Tomsky appeared before the Political
    Bureau in high dudgeon and, fully supported by Comrade Rudzutak,
    the most even-tempered of men, began to relate that at the
    Conference Comrade Trotsky had talked about “shaking
    up” the trade unions and that he, Tomsky, had opposed
    this—when that happened, I decided there and then that
    policy (i.e., the Party’s trade union policy) lay at the
    root of the controversy, and that Comrade Trotsky, with his
    “shake-up” policy against Comrade Tomsky, was entirely
    in the wrong. For, even if the “shake-up ”
    policy were partly justified by the “new tasks and
    methods” (Trotsky’s thesis 12), it cannot be tolerated
    at the present time, and in the present situation, because it
    threatens a split.
It now seems to Comrade Trotsky that it is “an utter
    travesty “ to ascribe the “shake-up-from-above “
    policy to him (L. Trotsky, “A Reply to the Petrograd
    Comrades”, Pravda No. 9, January 15, 1921). But
    “shake-up” is a real “catchword”, not only
    in the sense that after being uttered by Comrade Trotsky at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions it has, you might say,
    “caught on” throughout the Party and the trade
    unions. Unfortunately, it remains true even today in the much more
    profound sense that it alone epitomises the whole spirit,
    the whole trend of the platform pamphlet entitled The
    Role and Tactics of the Trade Unions. Comrade Trotsky’s
    platform pamphlet is shot through with the spirit of the
    “shake-up-from-above” policy. Just recall the
    accusation made against Comrade Tomsky, or “many trade
    unionists”, that they “tend to cultivate in their
    midst a spirit of hostility for the new men”!
But whereas the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions
    (November 2-6, 1920) only saw the makings of the atmosphere
    fraught with splits, the split within Tsektran became a fact in
    early December 1920.
This event is basic and essential to an understanding of the
    political essence of our controversies; and Comrades Trotsky and
    Bukharin are mistaken if they think hushing it up will help
    matters. A hush-up in this case does not produce a
    “buffer” effect but rouses passions; for the question
    has not only been placed on the agenda by developments, but has
    been emphasised by Comrade Trotsky in his platform pamphlet. It is
    this pamphlet that repeatedly, in the passages I have quoted,
    particularly in thesis 12, raises the question of whether the
    essence of the matter is that “many trade unionists tend to
    cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new
    men”, or that the “hostility” of the
    masses is legitimate in view of certain useless and
    harmful excesses of bureaucracy, for example, in Tsektran.
The issue was bluntly and properly stated by Comrade Zinoviev
    in his very first speech on December 30, 1920, when he said that
    it was “Comrade Trotsky’s immoderate adherents”
    who had brought about a split. Perhaps that is why Comrade
    Bukharin abusively described Comrade Zinoviev’s speech as
    “a lot of hot air”? But every Party member who reads
    the verbatim report of the December 30, 1920 discussion will see
    that that is not true. He will find that it is Comrade Zinoviev
    who quotes and operates with the facts, and that it is Trotsky and
    Bukharin who indulge most in intellectualist verbosity minus the
    facts.
When Comrade Zinoviev said, “Tsektran stands on feet of
    clay and has already split into three parts”, Comrade
    Sosnovsky interrupted and said:
“That is something you have encouraged
    “ (verbatim report, p. 15).
Now this is a serious charge. If it were proved, there would,
    of course, be no place on the Central Committee, in the R.C.P., or
    in the trade unions of our Republic for those who were guilty of
    encouraging a split even in one of the trade
    unions. Happily, this serious charge was advanced in a thoughtless
    manner by a comrade who, I regret to say, has now and again been
    “carried away” by thoughtless polemics before
    this. Comrade Sosnovsky has even managed to insert “a fly in
    the ointment” of his otherwise excellent articles, say, on
    production propaganda, and this has tended to negate all its
    pluses. Some people (like Comrade Bukharin) are so happily
    constituted that they are incapable of injecting venom into their
    attacks even when the fight is bitterest; others, less happily
    constituted, are liable to do so, and do this all too
    often. Comrade Sosnovsky would do well to watch his step in this
    respect, and perhaps even ask his friends to help out.
But, some will say, the charge is there, even if it has been
    made in a thoughtless, unfortunate and patently
    “factional” form. In a serious matter, the badly
    worded truth is preferable to the hush-up.
That the matter is serious is beyond doubt, for, let me say
    this again, the crux of the issue lies in this area to a
    greater extent than is generally suspected. Fortunately, we are in
    possession of sufficiently objective and conclusive facts to
    provide an answer in substance to Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s point.
First of all, there is on the same page of the verbatim report
    Comrade Zinoviev’s statement denying Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s allegation and making precise references to
    conclusive facts. Comrade Zinoviev showed that Comrade
    Trotsky’s accusation (made obviously, let me add, in an
    outburst of factional zeal) was quite a different one from Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s; Comrade Trotsky’s accusation was that
    Comrade Zinoviev’s speech at the September All-Russia
    Conference of the R.C.P. had helped to bring about or had
    brought about the split. (This charge, let me say in parenthesis,
    is quite untenable, if only because Zinoviev’s September
    speech was approved in substance by the Central Committee and the
    Party, and there has been no formal protest against it since.)
Comrade Zinoviev replied that at the Central Committee meeting
    Comrade Rudzutak had used the minutes to prove that
    “long before any of my [Zinoviev’sl speeches
    and the All-Russia Conference the question [concerning certain
    unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy in Tsektran] had
    been examined in Siberia, on the Volga, in the North and in the
    South”.
That is an absolutely precise and clear-cut statement of
    fact. It was made by Comrade Zinoviev in his first speech before
    thousands of the most responsible Party members, and his facts
    were not refuted either by Comrade Trotsky, who spoke
    twice later, or by Comrade Bukharin, who also spoke
    later.
Secondly, the December 7, 1920 resolution of the Central
    Committee’s Plenary Meeting concerning the dispute between
    the Communists working in water transport and the Communist group
    at the Tsektran Conference, given in the same verbatiln
    report, was an even more definite and official refutation of
    Comrade Sosnovsky’s charges. The part of the resolution
    dealing with Tsektran says:
 “In connection with the dispute between
    Tsektran and the water transport workers, the Central Committee
    resolves: 1) To set up a Water Transport Section within the
    amalgamated Tsektran; 2) To convene a congress of railwaymen and
    water transport workers in February to hold normal elections to a
    new Tsektran; 3) To authorise the old Tsektran to function until
    then; 4) To abolish Glavpolitvod and Glavpolitput immediately and
    to transfer all their funds and resources to the trade union on
    normal democratic lines.”
 This shows that the water transport workers, far from being
    censured, are deemed to be right in every essential. Yet
    none of the C.C. members who had signed the common
    platform of January 14, 1921 (except Kamenev) voted for the
    resolution. (The platform referred to is the Role and Tasks of
    the Trade Unions. Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of
    the R.C.P., submitted to the Central Committee by a group of
    members of the Central Committee and the trade union
    commission. Among those who signed it was Lozovsky, a member of
    the trade union commission but not of the Central Committee. The
    others were Tomsky, Kalinin, Rudzutak, Zinoviev, Stalin, Lenin,
    Kamenev, Petrovsky and Artyom Sergeyev.)
This resolution was carried against the C.C. members
    listed above, that is, against our group, for we would have voted
    against allowing the old Tsektran to continue temporarily. Because
    we were sure to win, Trotsky was forced to vote for
    Bukharin’s resolution, as otherwise our resolution would
    have been carried. Comrade Rykov, who had been for
    Trotsky in November, took part in the trade union
    commission’s examination of the dispute between Tsektran and
    the water transport workers in December, and saw that the latter
    were right.
To sum up: the December 7 majority in the Central Committee
    consisted of Comrades Trotsky, Bukharin, Preobrazhensky,
    Serebryakov and other C.C. members who are above suspicion of
    being biased against Tsektran. Yet the substance of their
    resolution did not censure the water transport workers but
    Tsektran, which they just stopped short of dissolving there and
    then. This proves Sosnovsky’s charge to be quite
    groundless.
There is one other point to be dealt with, if we are to leave
    no room for ambiguity. What were these “certain unwarranted
    and harmful excesses of bureaucracy” to which I have
    repeatedly referred? Isn’t this last charge
    unsupported or exaggerated?
Once again it was Comrade Zinoviev who, in his very first
    speech on December 30, 1920, provided the answer which was as
    precise as one could wish. He quoted from Comrade Zoff’s
    water transport circular of May 3, 1920: “Committee
    treadmill abolished.”[3] Comrade Zinoviev was
    quite right in saying this was a fundamental error. It exemplified
    the unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy and the
    “appointments system”. But he said there and then that
    some appointees were “not half as experienced or as
    tried” as Comrade Zoff. I have heard Comrade Zoff referred
    to in the Central Committee as a most valuable worker, and this is
    fully borne out by my own observations in the Council of
    Defence. It has not entered anyone’s mind either to make
    scapegoats of such comrades or to undermine their authority (as
    Comrade Trotsky suggests, without the least justification, on page
    25 of his report). Their authority is not being undermined by
    those who try to correct the “appointees’”
    mistakes, but by those who would defend them even when they are
    wrong.
We see, therefore, that the danger of splits within the trade
    union movement was not imaginary but real. And we find that the
    actual disagreements really boiled down to a demand that certain
    unwarranted and harmful exccesses of bureaucracy, and the
    appointments system should not be justified or defended, but
    corrected. That is all there is to it.
Disagreements On Principle
There being deep and basic disagreements on principle—we
    may well be asked—do they not serve as vindication for the
    sharpest and most factional pronouncements? Is it possible to
    vindicate such a thing as a split, provided there is need to drive
    home some entirely new idea?
I believe it is, provided of course the disagreements are truly
    very deep and there is no other way to rectify a wrong trend in
    the policy of the Party or of the working class.
But the whole point is that there are no such
    disagreements. Comrade Trotsky has tried to point them out, and
    failed. A tentative or conciliatory approach had been
    possible—and necessary—before the publication
    of his pamphlet (December 25) (“such an approach is ruled
    out even in the case of disagreements and vague new tasks”);
    but after its publication we had to say: Comrade Trotsky
    is essentially wrong on all his new points.
This is most evident from a comparison of his theses with
    Rudzutak’s which were adopted by the Fifth All Russia
    Conference of Trade Unions (November 2-6). I quoted the latter in
    my December 30 speech and in the January 21 issue of
    Pravda. They are-fuller and more correct than
    Trotsky’s, and wherever the latter differs from Rudzutak, he
    is wrong.
Take this famous “industrial democracy”, which
    Comrade Bukharin hastened to insert in the Central
    Committee’s resolution of December 7. It would, of course,
    be ridiculous to quibble about this ill-conceived brainchild
    (“tricky flourishes”), if it merely occurred in an
    article or speech. But, after all, it was Trotsky and Bukharin who
    put themselves into the ridiculous position by insisting in
    their theses on this very term, which is the one feature that
    distinguishes their “platforms” from Rudzutak’s
    theses adopted by the trade unions.
The term is theoretically wrong. In the final analysis, every
    kind of democracy, as political superstructure in general (which
    must exist until classes have been abolished and a classless
    society established), serves production and is ultimately
    determined by the relations of production in a given society. It
    is, therefore, meaningless to single out “industrial
    democracy”, for this leads to confusion, and the result is a
    dummy. That is the first point.
The second is that if you look at Bukharin’s own
    explanation given in the resolution of the C.C. Plenary Meeting on
    December 7, which he drafted, you will find that he says:
    “Accordingly, the methods of workers’ democracy must
    be those of industrial democracy, which means. . . .” Note
    the “which means”! The fact is that Bukharin opens his
    appeal to the masses with such an outlandish term that he must
    give a gloss on it. This, I think, is
    undemocratic from the democratic standpoint. You must
    write for the masses without using terms that require a
    glossary. This is bad from the “production” standpoint
    because time is wasted in explaining unnecessary
    terms. “Which means,” he says, “that nomination
    and seconding of candidates, elections, etc., must proceed with an
    eye not only to their political staunchness, but also business
    efficiency, administrative experience, leadership, and proved
    concern for the working people’s material and spiritual
    interests.”
The reasoning there is obviously artificial and incorrect. For
    one thing, democracy is more than “nomination and seconding
    of candidates, elections, etc.” Then, again, not all
    elections should be held with an eye to political staunchness and
    business efficiency. Comrade Trotsky notwithstanding, an
    organisation of many millions must have a certain percentage of
    canvassers and bureaucrats (we shall not be able to make do
    without good bureaucrats for many years to come). But we do not
    speak of “canvassing” or “bureaucratic”
    democracy.
The third point is that it is wrong to consider only the
    elected, the organisers, the administrators, etc. After all, they
    constitute a minority of outstanding men. It is the mass, the rank
    and file that we must consider. Rudzutak has it in simpler, more
    intelligible and theoretically more correct terms (thesis 6):
 “. . . it must be brought home to each
    participant in production that his production tasks are
    appropriate and important; that each must not only take a hand in
    fulfilling his assignments, but also play an intelligent part in
    correcting any technical and organisational defects in the sphere
    of production. 
    
The fourth point is that “industrial democracy” is
    a term that lends itself to misinterpretation. It may be read as a
    repudiation of dictatorship and individual authority. It may be
    read as a suspension of ordinary democracy or a pretext for
    evading it. Both readings are harmful, and cannot be avoided
    without long special commentaries.
Rudzutak’s plain statement of the same ideas is more
    correct and more handy. This is indirectly confirmed by
    Trotsky’s parallel of “war democracy” which he
    draws with his own term in an article, “Industrial
    Democracy”, in Pravda of January 11, and which
    fails to refute that his term is inaccurate and inconvenient (for
    he side-steps the whole issue and fails to compare his theses with
    Rudzutak’s). Happily, as far as I can recall, we have never
    had any factional controversy over that kind of term.
Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” is even
    wider of the mark, and Zinoviev had good reason to laugh at
    it. This made Trotsky very angry, and he came out with this
    argument: “We once had a war atmosphere. . . . We must now
    have a production atmosphere and not only on the surface but deep
    down in the workers’ mass. This must be as intense and
    practical an interest in production as was earlier displayed in
    the fronts. . . .” Well, there you are: the message must be
    carried “deep down into the workers’ mass” in
    the language of Rudzutak’s theses, because “production
    atmosphere” will only earn you a smile or a shrug. Comrade
    Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” has
    essentially the same meaning as production propaganda, but such
    expressions must be avoided when production propaganda is
    addressed to the workers at large. The term is an example of how
    not to carry it on among the masses.
Politics And Economics. Dialectics And
    Eclecticism
It is strange that we should have to return to such elementary
    questions, but we are unfortunately forced to do so by Trotsky and
    Bukharin. They have both reproached me for “switching
    “ the issue, or for taking a “political”
    approach, while theirs is an “economic” one. Bukharin
    even put that in his theses and tried to “rise above”
    either side, as if to say that he was combining the two.
This is a glaring theoretical error. I said again in my speech
    that politics is a concentrated expression of economics, because I
    had earlier heard my “political” approach rebuked in a
    manner which is inconsistent and inadmissible for a
    Marxist. Politics must take precedence over economics. To argue
    otherwise is to forget the ABC of Marxism.
Am I wrong in my political appraisal? If you think so, say it
    and prove it. But you forget the ABC of Marxism when you say (or
    imply) that the political approach is equivalent to the
    “economic”, and that you can take “the one and
    the other”.
What the political approach means, in other words, is that the
    wrong attitude to the trade unions will ruin the Soviet power and
    topple the dictatorship of the proletariat. (In a peasant country
    like Russia, the Soviet power would surely go down in the event of
    a split between the trade unions and a Party in the wrong.) This
    proposition can (and must) be tested in substance, which means
    looking into the rights and wrongs of the approach and taking a
    decision. To say: I “appreciate” your political,
    approach, “but ” it is only a political one
    and we “also need an economic one”, is
    tantamount to saying: I “appreciate” your point that
    in taking that particular step you are liable to break your neck,
    but you must also take into consideration that it is
    better to be clothed and well-fed than to go naked and hungry.
Bukharin’s insistence on combining the political
    and the economic approach has landed him in theoretical
    eclecticism.
Trotsky and Bukharin make as though they are concerned for the
    growth of production whereas we have nothing but formal democracy
    in mind. This picture is wrong, because the only
    formulation of the issue (which the Marxist standpoint allows
    ) is: without a correct political approach to the matter the
    given class will be unable to stay on top, and,
    consequently, will be incapable of solving its
    production problem either.
Let us take a concrete example. Zinoviev says: “By
    carrying things to a split within the trade unions, you are making
    a political mistake. I spoke and wrote about the growth of
    production back in January 1920, citing the construction of the
    public baths as an example.” Trotsky replies: “What a
    thing to boast of: a pamphlet with the public baths as an example
    (p. 29),’and not a single word’ about the tasks of the
    trade unions” (p. 22).
This is wrong. The example of the public baths is worth, you
    will pardon the pun, a dozen “production atmospheres”,
    with a handful of “industrial democracies” thrown
    in. It tells the masses, the whole bulk of them, what the trade
    unions are to do, and does this in plain and intelligible terms,
    whereas all these “production atmospheres” and
    “democracies” are so much murk blurring the vision of
    the workers’ masses, and dimming their
    understanding.
Comrade Trotsky also rebuked me for not “saying a
    word” (p. 66) about “the role that has to be
    played—and is being played—by the levers known as the
    trade union apparatus”.
I beg to differ, Comrade Trotsky. By reading out
    Rudzutak’s theses in toto and endorsing them, I made a
    statement on the question that was fuller,
    plainer, clearer and more correct than all your
    theses, your report or co-report, and speech in reply to the
    debate. I insist that bonuses in kind and disciplinary
    comrades’ courts mean a great deal more to economic
    development, industrial management, and wider trade union
    participation in production than the absolutely abstract (and
    therefore empty) talk about “industrial democracy”,
    “coalescence”, etc.
Behind the effort to present the “production”
    standpoint (Trotsky) or to overcome a one-sided political approach
    and combine it with an economic approach (Bukharin) we find:
1)Neglect of Marxism, as expressed in the theoretically
    incorrect, eclectic definition of the relation between politics
    and economics;
2 )Defence or camouflage of the political mistake expressed in
    the shake-up policy, which runs through the whole of
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, and which, unless it is
    admitted and corrected, leads to the collapse of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat;
3)A step back in purely economic and production matters, and
    the question of how to increase production; it is, in fact, a step
    back from Rudzutak’s practical theses, with their
    concrete, vital and urgent tasks (develop production propaganda;
    learn proper distribution of bonuses in kind and correct use of
    coercion through disciplinary comrades’ courts), to the
    highbrow, abstract, “empty” and theoretically
    incorrect general theses which ignore all that
    is most practical and business-like.
That is where Zinoviev and myself, on the one hand, and Trotsky
    and Bukharin, on the other, actually stand on this question of
    politics and economics.
I could not help smiling, therefore, when I read Comrade
    Trotsky’s objection in his speech of December 30: “In
    his summing-up at the Eighth Congress of Soviets of the debate on
    the situation, Comrade Lenin said we ought to have less politics
    and more economics, but when he got to the trade union question he
    laid emphasis on the political aspect of the matter”
    (p. 65). Comrade Trotsky thought these words were “very much
    to the point”. Actually, however, they reveal a terrible
    confusion of ideas, a truly hopeless “ideological
    confusion”. Of course, I have always said, and will continue
    to say, that we need more economics and less politics, but if we
    are to have this we must clearly be rid of political dangers
    and political mistakes. Comrade Trotsky’s political
    mistakes, aggravated by Comrade Bukharin, distract our
    Party’s attention from economic tasks and
    “production” work, and, unfortunately,
    make us waste time on correcting them and arguing it out
    with the syndicalist deviation (which leads to the collapse of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat), objecting to the incorrect
    approach to the trade union movement (which leads to the collapse
    of the Soviet power), and debating general “theses”,
    instead of having a practical and business-like
    “economic” discussion as to whether it was the Saratov
    millers, the Donbas miners, the Petrograd metalworkers or some
    other group that had the best results in coalescing, distributing
    bonuses in kind, and organising comrades’ courts, on the
    basis of Rudzutak’s theses, adopted by the Fifth
    All-Russia-Trade Union Conference on November 2-6.
Let us now consider what good there is in a “broad
    discussion”. Once again we find political mistakes
    distracting attention from economic tasks. I was against this
    “broad” discussion, and I believed, and still do, that
    it was a mistake—a political mistake—on Comrade
    Trotsky’s part to disrupt the work of the trade union
    commission, which ought to have held a business-like discussion. I
    believe Bukharin’s buffer group made the political mistake
    of misunderstanding the tasks of the buffer (in which case they
    had once again substituted eclecticism for dialectics), for from
    the “buffer” standpoint they should have vigorously
    opposed any broad discussion and demanded that the matter should
    be taken up by the trade union commission. Here is what came of
    this.
On December 30, Bukharin went so far as to say that “we
    have proclaimed the new and sacred slogan of workers’
    democracy, which means that questions are no longer to be
    discussed in the board-room within the corporation or at small
    meetings but are to be placed before big meetings. I insist that
    by taking the trade union issue before such a large meeting as
    this one we are not taking a step backward but forward”
    (p. 45). And this man has accused Zinoviev of spouting “hot
    air” and overdoing the democracy! I say that he himself has
    given us a lot of hot air and has shown some unexampled bungling;
    he has completely failed to understand that formal democracy must
    be subordinate to the revolutionary interest.
Trotsky is in the same boat. His charge is that “Lenin
    wants at all costs to disrupt or shelve the discussion of the
    matter in essence” (p. 65). He declares: “My reasons
    for refusing to serve on the commission were clearly stated in the
    Central Committee: until such time as I am permitted, on a par
    with all other comrades, to air these questions fully in the Party
    press, I do not expect any good to come of any cloistered
    examination of these matters, and, consequently, of work on the
    commission” (p. 69).
What is the result? Less than a month has passed since Trotsky
    started his “broad discussion” on December 25, and you
    will be hard put to find one responsible Party worker in a hundred
    who is not fed up with the discussion and has not realised its
    futility (to say no worse). For Trotsky has made the Party waste
    time on a discussion of words and bad theses, and has ridiculed as
    “cloistered” the business-like economic
    discussion in the commission, which was to have studied and
    verified practical experience and projected its lessons for
    progress in real “production” work, in place
    of the regress from vibrant activity to scholastic
    exercises in all sorts of “production
    atmospheres”.
Take this famous “coalescence”. My advice on
    December 30 was that we should keep mum on this point, because we
    had not studied our own practical experience, and without
    that any discussion was bound to degenerate into “hot
    air” and draw off the Party’s forces from
    economic work. I said it was bureaucratic projecteering for
    Trotsky to propose in his theses that from one-third to one-half
    and from one-half to two-thirds of the economic councils should
    consist of trade unionists.
For this I was upbraided by Bukharin who, I see from p. 49 of
    the report, made a point of proving to me at length and in great
    detail that “when people meet to discuss something, they
    should not act as deaf-mutes” (sic ). Trotsky was
    also angry and exclaimed:
 “Will every one of you please make a note
    that on this particular date Comrade Lenin described this as a
    bureaucratic evil. I take the liberty to predict that within a few
    months we shall have accepted for our guidance and consideration
    that the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the
    Supreme Economic Council, the Central Committee of the
    Metalworkers’ Union and the Metals Department, etc., are to
    have from one-third to one-half of their members in common”
    (p. 68).
When I read that I asked Comrade Milyutin (Deputy Chairman of
    the Supreme Economic Council) to let me have the available
    printed reports on coalescence. I said to my self: why
    not make a small start on the study of our practical experience;
    it’s so dull engaging in “general Party talk”
    (Bukharin’s expression, p. 47, which has every chance of
    becoming a catchword like “shake-up”) to no useful
    purpose, without the facts, and inventing disagreements,
    definitions and “industrial democracies”.   

    

      Comrade
      Milyutin sent me several books, including The Report of the
Supreme Economic Council to the Eighth All-Russia Congress of
Soviets (Moscow, 1920; preface dated December 19, 1920). On
      its p. 14 is a table showing workers’ participation in
      administrative bodies. Here is the table (covering only part of
      the gubernia economic councils and factories):

It will be seen that 61.6 per cent, that is, closer to
    two-thirds than to one-half, of the staff of administrative bodies
    now consists of workers. And this already proves that what Trotsky
    wrote on this matter in his theses was an exercise in bureaucratic
    projecteering. To talk, argue and write platforms about
    “one-third to one-half” and “one-half to
    two-thirds” is the most useless sort of “general Party
    talk”, which diverts time, attention and resources from
    production work. It is empty politicking. All this while,
    a great deal of good could have been done in the commission, where
    men of experience would have refused to write any theses without a
    study of the facts, say, by polling a dozen or so “common
    functionaries” (out of the thousand), by comparing their
    impressions and conclusions with objective statistical data, and
    by making an attempt to obtain practical guidance for the future:
    that being our experience, do we go straight on, or do we make
    some change in our course, methods and approach, and how; or do we
    call a halt, for the good of the cause, and check things over and
    over again, make a few changes here and there, and so on and so
    forth.
Comrades, a real “executive” (let me also have a go
    at “production propaganda”) is well aware that even in
    the most advanced countries, the capitalists and their executives
    take years—sometimes ten and more—to study and test
    their own (and others’) practical experience, making
    innumerable starts and corrections to tailor a system of
    management, select senior and junior executives, etc., fit for
    their particular business. That was the rule under capitalism,
    which throughout the civilised world based its business practices
    on the experience and habits of centuries. We who are
    breaking new ground must put in a long, persistent and patient
    effort to retrain men and change the old habits which have come
    down to us from capitalism, but this can only be done little by
    little. Trotsky’s approach is quite wrong. In his December
    30 speech he exclaimed: “Do or do not our workers, Party and
    trade union functionaries have any production training? Yes or no?
    I say: No” (p. 29). This is a ridiculous approach. It is
    like asking whether a division has enough felt boots: Yes or
    no?
It is safe to say that even ten years from now we shall have to
    admit that all our Party and trade union functionaries do not have
    enough production training, in much the same way as the workers of
    the Military Department, the trade unions and the Party will not
    have had enough military experience. But we have made a
    start on production training by having about a thousand
    workers, and trade union members and delegates take part in
    management and run factories, head offices and other bodies higher
    up the scale. The basic principle underlying “production
    training”—which is the training of our own
    selves, of the old underground workers and professional
    journalists—is that we should start a painstaking and
    detailed study of our own practical experience, and teach others
    to do so, according to the rule: Look before you leap. The
    fundamental and absolute rule behind “production
    training” is systematic, circumspect, practical and business
    like verification of what this one thousand have done, and even
    more efficient and careful correction of their work, taking a step
    forward only when there is ample proof of the usefulness of a
    given method, system of management, proportion, selection of men,
    etc. And it is this rule that Comrade Trotsky has broken by his
    theses and approach. All his theses, his entire platform pamphlet,
    are so wrong that they have diverted the Party’s attention
    and resources from practical “production” work to a
    lot of empty talk.
Dialectics and Eclecticism 
      “School” and “Apparatus”
Among Comrade Bukharin’s many excellent traits are his
    theoretical ability and keen interest in getting at the
    theoretical roots of every question. That is a very valuable trait
    because you cannot have a proper understanding of any mistake, let
    alone a political one, unless you dig down to its theoretical
    roots among the basic premises of the one who makes it.
Responding to this urge, Comrade Bukharin tended to shift the
    controversy into the theoretical sphere, beginning from December
    30, if not earlier.
In his speech on that day he said: “That neither the
    political nor the economic factor can be ignored is, I believe,
    absolutely incontrovertible—and that is the theoretical
    essence of what is here known as the’buffer group’ or
    its ideology “ (p. 47).
The gist of his theoretical mistake in this case is
    substitution of eclecticism for the dialectical interplay of
    politics and economics (which we find in Marxism). His theoretical
    attitude is: “on the one hand, and on the other”,
    “the one and the other”. That is
    eclecticism. Dialectics requires an all-round consideration of
    relationships in their concrete development but not a patchwork of
    bits and pieces. I have shown this to be so on the example of
    politics and economics.
That of the “buffer” has gone to reinforce the
    point. You need a buffer, and it is useful when the Party train is
    heading for a crash. No question about that at all. Bukharin has
    built up his “buffer” problem eclectically, by
    collecting odd pieces from Zinoviev and Trotsky. As a
    “buffer”, Bukharin should have decided for himself
    just where, when and how each individual or group had made their
    mistake, whether it was a theoretical mistake, one of political
    tact, factional pronouncement, or exaggeration, etc. He should
    have done that and gone hammer and tongs at every such
    mistake. But he has failed to understand his task of
    “buffer”, and here is good proof of it.
The Communist group of Tsektran’s Petrograd Bureau (the
    C.C. of the Railwaymen’s and Water Transport Workers’
    Union), an organisation sympathising with Trotsky, has stated its
    opinion that, “on the main issue of the trade unions’
    role in production, Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin hold views which
    are variations of one and the same standpoint”. It has
    issued Comrade Bukharin’s report in Petrograd on January
    3,1921, in pamphlet form (N. Bukharin, The Tasks of the Trade
    Unions, Petrograd, 1921). It says:
 “Comrade Trotsky’s original
    formulation was that the trade union leadership should be removed
    and suitable comrades found to take their place, etc. He had
    earlier advocated a’shake-up’, but he has now
    abandoned the idea, and it is therefore quite absurd to use it as
    an argument against him” (p. 5).
I will let pass the numerous factual inaccuracies in this
    statement. (Trotsky used the term “shake-up” at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, November 2-6. He
    mentions “selection of leadership” in Paragraph 5 of
    his theses which he submitted to the Central Committee on November
    8, and which, incidentally, some of his supporters have published
    as a leaflet. The whole of Trotsky’s pamphlet, The Role
    and Tasks of the Trade Unions, December 25, reveals the same
    kind of mentality, the same spirit as I have pointed out
    before. When and how he “abandoned” this attitude
    remains a mystery.) I am now dealing with a different matter. When
    the “buffer” is an eclectic, he passes over some
    mistakes and brings up others; he says nothing of them in Moscow
    on December 30, 1920, when addressing thousands of
    R.C.P. functionaries from all over Russia; but he brings them up
    in Petrograd on January 3, 1921. When the “buffer” is
    a dialectician, he directs the full brunt of his attack at every
    mistake he sees on either side, or on all sides. And that is
    something Bukharin does not do. He does not even try to examine
    Trotsky’s pamphlet in the light of the
    “shake-up” policy. He simply says nothing about
    it. No wonder his buffer performance has made everyone
    laugh.
To proceed. In that same Petrograd speech he says (p. 7):
 “Comrade Trotsky’s mistake is
    insufficient support for the school-of-communism idea.”
During the December 30 discussion, Bukharin reasoned as
    follows:
 “Comrade Zinoviev has said that the trade
    unions are a school of communism, and Trotsky has said that they
    are a technical and administrative apparatus for industrial
    management. I see no logical grounds for proof that either
    proposition is wrong; both, and a combination of both, are
    right” (p. 48).
Bukharin and his “group” or “faction”
    make the same point in their thesis 6: “On the one hand,
    they [the trade unions] are a school of communism . . . and on the
    other, they are—increasingly—a component part of the
    economic apparatus and of state administration in general”
    (Pravda, January 16).
That is where we find Comrade Bukharin’s fundamental
    theoretical mistake, which is substitution of eclecticism
    (especially popular with the authors of diverse
    “fashionable” and reactionary philosophical systems)
    for Marxist dialectics.
When Comrade Bukharin speaks of “logical” grounds,
    his whole reasoning shows that he takes—unconsciously,
    perhaps—the standpoint of formal or scholastic logic, and
    not of dialectical or Marxist logic. Let me explain this by taking
    the simple example which Comrade Bukharin himself gives. In the
    December 30 discussion he said:
 “Comrades, many of you may find that the
    current controversy suggests something like this: two men come in
    and invite each other to define the tumbler on the lectern. One
    says:‘It is a glass cylinder, and a curse on anyone who says
    different.’ The other one says:‘A tumbler is a
    drinking vessel, and a curse on anyone who says
    different’”(p. 46).
The reader will see that Bukharin’s example was meant to
    give me a popular explanation of the harm of one-track thinking. I
    accept it with gratitude, and in the one-good
    turn-deserves-another spirit offer a popular explanation of the
    difference between dialectics and eclecticism.
A tumbler is assuredly both a glass cylinder and a drinking
    vessel. But there are more than these two properties, qualities or
    facets to it; there are an infinite number of them, an infinite
    number of “mediacies” and inter-relationships with the
    rest of the world. A tumbler is a heavy object which can be used
    as a missile; it can serve as a paper weight, a receptacle for a
    captive butterfly, or a valuable object with an artistic engraving
    or design, and this has nothing at all to do with whether or not
    it can be used for drinking, is made of glass, is cylindrical or
    not quite, and so on and so forth.
Moreover, if I needed a tumbler just now for drinking, it would
    not in the least matter how cylindrical it was, and whether it was
    actually made of glass; what would matter though would be whether
    it had any holes in the bottom, or anything that would cut my lips
    when I drank, etc. But if I did not need a tumbler for drinking
    but for a purpose that could be served by any glass cylinder, a
    tumbler with a cracked bottom or without one at all would do just
    as well, etc.
Formal logic, which is as far as schools go (and should go,
    with suitable abridgements for the lower forms), deals with formal
    definitions, draws on what is most common, or glaring, and stops
    there. When two or more different definitions are taken and
    combined at random (a glass cylinder and a drinking vessel), the
    result is an eclectic definition which is indicative of different
    facets of the object, and nothing more.
 Dialectical logic demands that we should go further. Firstly,
    if we are to have a true knowledge of an object we must look at
    and examine all its facets, its connections and
    “mediacies”. That is something we cannot ever hope to
    achieve completely, but the rule of comprehensiveness is a
    safeguard against mistakes and rigidity. Secondly, dialectical
    logic requires that an object should be taken in development, in
    change, in “self-movement” (as Hegel sometimes puts
    it). This is not immediately obvious in respect of such an object
    as a tumbler, but it, too, is in flux, and this holds especially
    true for its purpose, use and connection with the
    surrounding world. Thirdly, a full “definition” of an
    object must include the whole of human experience, both as a
    criterion of truth and a practical indicator of its connection
    with human wants. Fourthly, dialectical logic holds that
    “truth is always concrete, never abstract”, as the
    late Plekhanov liked to say after Hegel. (Let me add in
    parenthesis for the benefit of young Party members that you
    cannot hope to become a real, intelligent
    Communist without making a study—and I mean
    study—of all of Plekhanov’s philosophical
    writings, because nothing better has been written on Marxism
    anywhere in the world.[3b])
 I have not, of course, run through the whole notion of
    dialectical logic, but what I have said will do for the present. I
    think we can return from the tumbler to the trade unions and
    Trotsky’s platform.
 “A school, on the one hand, and an apparatus on the
    other”, says Bukharin, and writes as much in his
    theses. Trotsky’s mistake is “insufficient support for
    the school-of-communism idea”; Zinoviev errs by being
    lukewarm on the apparatus “factor”.
Why is Bukharin’s reasoning no more than inert and empty
    eclecticism? It is because he does not even try to make an
    independent analysis, from his own standpoint, either of the whole
    course of the current controversy (as Marxism, that is,
    dialectical logic, unconditionally demands) or of the whole
    approach to the question, the whole presentation—the whole
    trend of the presentation, if you will—of the question at
    the present time and in these concrete circumstances. You do not
    see Bukharin doing that at all! His approach is one of pure
    abstraction: he makes no attempt at concrete study, and takes bits
    and pieces from Zinoviev and Trotsky. That is eclecticism.
Here is another example to clarify the picture. I know next to
    nothing about the insurgents and revolutionaries of South China
    (apart from the two or three articles by Sun Yat-sen, and a few
    books and newspaper articles I read many years ago). Since there
    are these uprisings, it is not too far-fetched to assume a
    controversy going on between Chinese No. 1, who says that the
    insurrection is the product of a most acute nation-wide class
    struggle, and Chinese No. 2, who says that insurrection is an
    art. That is all I need to know in order to write theses
    à la Bukharin: “On the one hand, . . . on the
    other hand”. The one has failed to reckon with the art
    “factor”, and the other, with the “acuteness
    factor”, etc. Because no concrete study is made of
    this particular controversy, question, approach, etc.,
    the result is a dead and empty eclecticism.
On the one hand, the trade unions are a school, and on the
    other, an apparatus; but they also happen to be an organisation of
    working people, an almost exclusive organisation of industrial
    workers, an organisation by industry, etc.[3c]
    Bukharin does not make any analysis for himself, nor does he
    produce a shred of evidence to prove why it is that we should
    consider the first two “facets” of the question or
    object, instead of the third, the fourth, the fifth, etc. That is
    why his group’s theses are an eclectic soap bubble. His
    presentation of the “school-apparatus” relationship is
    fundamentally eclectic and wrong.
The only way to view this question in the right light is to
    descend from empty abstractions to the concrete, that is, the
    present issue. Whether you take it in the form it assumed at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, or as it was
    presented and slanted by Trotsky himself in his platform
    pamphlet of December 25, you will find that his whole
    approach is quite wrong and that he has gone off at a tangent. He
    has failed to understand that the trade unions can and must be
    viewed as a school both when raising the question of “Soviet
    trade-unionism”, and when speaking of production propaganda
    in general, and even when considering “coalescence”
    and trade union participation in industrial management, as
    Trotsky does. On this last point, as it is presented in
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, the mistake lies in his failure
    to grasp that the trade unions are a school of technical and
    administrative management of production. In the context of
    the controversy, you can not say: “a school, on the one
    hand, and something else on the other"; given Trotsky’s
    approach, the trade unions, whichever way you look at
    them, are a school. They are a school of unity,
    solidarity, management and administration, where you learn how to
    protect your interests. Instead of making an effort to comprehend
    and correct Comrade Trotsky’s fundamental mistake, Comrade
    Bukharin has produced a funny little amendment: “On the one
    hand, and on the other.”
Let us go deeper into the question. Let us see what the present
    trade unions are, as an “apparatus” of industrial
    management. We have seen from the incomplete returns that about
    900 workers—trade union members and delegates—are
    engaged in industrial management. If you multiply this number by
    10 or even by 100—if it helps to clarify your fundamental
    mistake let us assume this incredible speed of
    “advance” in the immediate future—you still have
    an insignificant proportion of those directly engaged in
    management, as compared with the mass of six million
    trade union members. This makes it even clearer that it is quite
    wrong to look to the “leading stratum”, and talk about
    the trade unions’ role in production and industrial
    management, as Trotsky does, forgetting that 98.5 per cent (6
    million minus 90,000 equals 5,910,000 or 98.5 per cent of the
    total) are learning, and will have to continue to do
    so for a long time to come. Don’t say school
    and management, say schooI of management.
In his December 30 argument against Zinoviev, whom he accused,
    quite groundlessly and incorrectly, of denying the
    “appointments system”, that is, the Central
    Committee’s right and duty to make appointments, Comrade
    Trotsky inadvertently drew the following telltale comparison:
 “Zinoviev tends to overdo the propaganda
    angle on every practical matter, forgetting that it is not only a
    source of material for agitation, but also a problem requiring an
    administrative solution” (p. 27).
Before I explain in detail the potential
    administrative approach to the issue, let me say that Comrade
    Trotsky’s fundamental mistake is that he treats (rather,
    maltreats) the questions he himself had brought up in his
    platform pamphlet as administrative ones, whereas
    they could be and ought to be viewed only from the
    propaganda angle.
In effect, what are Trotsky’s good points? One
    undoubtedly good and useful point is his production
    propaganda, but that is not in his theses, but in his
    speeches, specially when he forgets about his unfortunate polemics
    with the allegedly “conservative” wing of the
    trade-unionists. He would undoubtedly have done (and I believe he
    will do) a great deal of good in the trade union
    commission’s practical business, as speaker and writer, and
    as a member of the All-Russia Production Propaganda Bureau. His
    platform theses were a mistake, for through them, like a scarlet
    thread, runs the administrative approach to the
    “crisis” and the “two trends” within the
    trade unions, the interpretation of the R.C.P. Programme,
    “Soviet trade-unionism”, “production
    training” and “coalescence”. I have listed all
    the main points of Trotsky’s “platform “ and
    they all happen to be topics which, considering the material at
    Trotsky’s disposal, can be correctly approached at the
    present time only from the propaganda angle.
The state is a sphere of coercion. It would be madness to
    renounce coercion, especially in the epoch of the dictatorship of
    the proletariat, so that the administrative approach and
    “steerage” are indispensable. The Party is the leader,
    the vanguard of the proletariat, which rules directly. It is not
    coercion but expulsion from the Party that is the specific means
    of influence and the means of purging and steeling the
    vanguard. The trade unions are a reservoir of the state power, a
    school of communism and a school of management. The specific and
    cardinal thing in this sphere is not administration but
    the “ties ” “between the
    central state administration” (and, of course, the local as
    well), “the national economy and the broad masses
    of the working people” (see Party Programme, economic
    section, §5, dealing with the trade unions).
The whole of Trotsky’s platform pamphlet betrays an
    incorrect approach to the problem and a misunderstanding of this
    relationship.
Let us assume that Trotsky had taken a different approach to
    this famous question of “coalescence” in connection
    with the other topics of his platform, and that his pamphlet was
    entirely devoted to a detailed investigation of, say, 90 of the
    900 cases of “coalescence” where trade union officials
    and members concurrently held elective trade union posts and
    Supreme Economic Council posts in industrial management. Let us
    say these 90 cases had been analysed together with the returns of
    a selective statistical survey, the reports of inspectors and
    instructors of Rabkrin and the People’s Commissariats
    concerned: let us say they had been analysed in the light of the
    data supplied by the administrative bodies, the results of the
    work, the headway in production, etc. That would have been a
    correct administrative approach, and would have fullyy\ indicated
    the “shake-up” line, which implies concentrating
    attention on removals, transfers, appointments and the immediate
    demands to be made on the “leading stratum”. When
    Bukharin said in his January 3 speech, published by the Tsektran
    people in Petrograd, that Trotsky had at first wanted a
    “shake-up” but had now abandoned the idea, he made
    another one of his eclectical mistakes, which is ridiculous from
    the practical standpoint and theoretically inadmissible for a
    Marxist. He takes the question in the abstract, being unable (or
    unwilling) to get down to brass tacks. So long as we, the
    Party’s Central Committee and the whole Party, continue to
    run things, that is, govern, we shall never—we
    cannot—dispense with the “shake-up”, that is,
    removals, transfers, appointments, dismissals, etc. But
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet deals with something else, and
    does not raise the “question of practical business” at
    all. It is not this but the “trends within the
    trade union movement” (Trotsky’s thesis 4, end) that
    was being debated by Zinoviev and Trotsky, Bukharin and myself,
    and in fact the whole Party.
This is essentially a political question. Because of the
    substance of the case—this concrete, particular “case
    “—it is impossible to correct Trotsky’s mistake
    by means of eclectic little amendments and addenda, as Bukharin
    has been trying to do, being moved undoubted]y by the most humane
    sentiments and intensions.
 There is only one answer.
First, there must be a correct solution of the political
    question of the “trends within the trade union
    movement”, the relationship between classes, between
    politics and economics, the specific role of the state, the Party,
    the trade unions, as “school” and apparatus, etc.
Second, once the correct political decision has been adopted, a
    diversified nation-wide production propaganda campaign must be
    carried through, or, rather, systematically carried forward with
    persistence and patience over a long term, under the sponsorship
    and direction of a state agency. It should be conducted in such a
    way as to cover the same ground over and over again.
Third, the “questions of practical business” must
    not be confused with trend issues which properly belong to the
    sphere ofgeneral Party talk” and broad discussions; they
    must be dealt with as practical matters in the working
    commissions, with a hearing of witnesses and a study of memoranda,
    reports and statistics. And any necessary “shake-up”
    must be carried out only on that basis and in those circumstances:
    only under a decision of the competent Soviet or Party organ, or
    of both.
Trotsky and Bukharin have produced a hodgepodge of political
    mistakes in approach, breaks in the middle of the transmission
    belts, and unwarranted and futile attacks on “administrative
    steerage”. It is now clear where the
    “theoretical” source of the mistake lies, since
    Bukharin has taken up that aspect of it with his example of the
    tumbler. His theoretical—in this case, gnosiological—
    mistake lies in his substitution of eclecticism for
    dialectics. His eclectic approach has confused him and has landed
    him in syndicalism. Trotsky’s mistake is one-track thinking,
    compulsiveness, exaggeration and obstinacy. His platform says that
    a tumbler is a drinking vessel, but this particular tumbler
    happens to have no bottom.
Conclusion
It remains for me to go over a few more points which must be
    dealt with to prevent misunderstanding.
Thesis 6 of Trotsky’s platform quotes Paragraph 5 of the
    economic section of the R.C.P. Programme, which deals with the
    trade unions. Two pages later, his thesis 8 says:
“Having lost the old basis of their existence, the class
    economic struggle, the trade unions. . . “ (that is wrong,
    and is a hasty exaggeration: the trade unions no longer have to
    face the class economic struggle but the non-class
    “economic struggle”, which means combating
    bureaucratic distortions of the Soviet apparatus, safeguarding the
    working people’s material and spiritual interests in ways
    and means inaccessible to this apparatus, etc. This is a struggle
    they will unfortunately have to face for many more years to
    come). “The trade unions,” says Trotsky, “have,
    for various reasons, not yet succeeded in mustering the necessary
    forces and working out the necessary methods enabling them to
    solve the new task, that of organising production ”
    (Trotsky’s italics, p. 9, thesis 8), “set before them
    by the proletarian revolution and formulated in our
    Programme.”
That is yet another hasty exaggeration which is pregnant with
    grave error. The Programme does not contain any such formulation
    nor does it set the trade unions the task of “organising
    production”. Let us go over the propositions in the
    Party’s Programme as they unfold in the text:
(1)"The organisational apparatus” (but not the others)
    “of socialised industry should rely chiefly” (but not
    exclusively) “on the trade unions.” (2)"They must to
    an ever increasing degree divest themselves of the narrow
    craft-union spirit” (how? under the leadership of the Party
    and through the proletariat’s educational and other
    influence on the non-proletarian mass of working people)
    “and become large industrial associations, embracing the
    majority, and eventually all of the workers in the given
    industry.”
That is the first part of the section of the Party Programme
    dealing with the trade unions. You will have noted that it starts
    by laying down very “strict conditions”
    demanding a long sustained effort for what is to follow. And what
    follows is this:
“The trade unions being, on the strength of the laws of
    the Soviet Republic and established practice, participants”
    (note the cautious statement: participants only) “in all the
    local and central organs of industrial management, should
    eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their
    hands of the whole administration of the whole national economy,
    as a single economic entity” (note this: should arrive at a
    de facto concentration of management not of branches of
    industry and not of industry as a whole, but of the whole national
    economy, and moreover, as an economic entity. In economic terms,
    this condition may be considered fulfilled only when the petty
    producers both in industry and agriculture account for less than
    one-half of the population and the national economy). “The
    trade unions ensuring in this way” (the way which helps to
    realise all the conditions listed earlier) “indissoluble
    ties between the central state administration, the national
    economy and the broad masses of working people, should draw the
    latter” (that is, the masses, the majority of the
    population) “into direct economic management on the widest
    possible scale. At the same time, the participation of the trade
    unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the
    broad masses into this work are the principal means of combating
    the bureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the Soviet
    power and making possible the establishment of truly popular
    control over the results of production.”
There again, in that last sentence, we find a very cautious
    phrase: “participation in economic management"; and another
    reference to the recruitment of the broad masses as the chief (but
    not the only) means of combating bureaucratic practices; finally,
    we find a highly cautious statement: “making possible
    ” the establishment of “popular
    ”—that is, workers’ and peasants’,
    and not just purely proletarian—“control
    ”.
It is obviously wrong to boil this down to the Party Programme
    “formulating” the trade unions’ task as
    “organisation of production”. And if you insist on
    this error, and write it into your platform theses, you will get
    nothing but an anti-communist, syndicalist deviation.
Incidentally, Comrade Trotsky says in his theses that
    “over the last period we have not made any headway towards
    the goal set forth in the Programme but have in fact retreated
    from it” (p. 7, thesis 6). That statement is unsupported,
    and, I think, wrong. It is no proof to say, as Trotsky did in the
    discussions, that the trade unions “themselves” admit
    this. That is not the last resort, as far as the Party is
    concerned, and, generally speaking, the proof lies only in a
    serious and objective study of a great number of facts. Moreover,
    even if such proof were forthcoming, there would remain this
    question: Why have we retreated? Is it because “many
    trade-unionists “ are “balking at the new tasks and
    methods”, as Trotsky believes, or because “we have not
    yet succeeded in mustering the necessary forces and working out
    the necessary methods” to cut short and correct certain
    unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy?
Which brings me to Bukharin’s rebuke of December 30
    (repeated by Trotsky yesterday, January 24, during our discussion
    in the Communist group of the Second Miners’ Congress) that
    we have “dropped the line laid down by the Ninth Party
    Congress” (p. 46 of the report on the December 30
    discussion). He alleged that at that Congress I had defended the
    militarisation of labour and had jeered at references to
    democracy, all of which I now “repudiate”. In his
    reply to the debate on December 30, Comrade Trotsky added this
    barb: “Lenin takes account of the fact that . . . there is a
    grouping of opposition-minded comrades within the trade
    unions” (p. 65); that I view it from the “diplomatic
    angle” (p. 69), and that there is “manoeuvring inside
    the Party groups” (p. 70), etc. Putting such a complexion on
    the case is, of course, highly flattering for Trotsky, and worse
    than unflattering for me. But let us look at the facts.
In that same discussion on December 30, Trotsky and Krestinsky
    established the fact that “as long ago as July (1920),
    Comrade Preobrazhensky had proposed to the Central Committee that
    we should switch to a new track in respect of the internal life of
    our workers’ organisations” (p. 25). In August,
    Comrade Zinoviev drafted a letter, and the Central Committee
    approved a C.C. Letter on combating red-tape and
    extending democracy. In September, the question was brought up at
    a Party conference whose decisions were endorsed by the Central
    Committee. In December, the question of combating red-tape was
    laid before the Eighth Congress of Soviets. Consequently, the
    whole Central Committee, the whole Party and the whole
    workers’ and peasants’ Republic had recognised that
    the question of the bureaucracy and ways of combating its evils
    was high on the agenda. Does any “repudiation” of the
    Ninth Congress of the R.C.P. follow from all this? Of course,
    not. The decisions on the militarisation of labour, etc., are
    incontestable, and there is no need for me at all to withdraw any
    of my jibes at the references to democracy by those who challenged
    these decisions. What does follow is that we shall be extending
    democracy in the workers’ organisations, without turning it
    into a fetish; that we shall redouble our attention to the
    struggle against bureaucratic practices; and that we shall take
    special care to rectify any unwarranted and harmful excesses of
    bureaucracy, no matter who points them out.
One final remark on the minor question of priority and
    equalisation. I said during the December 30 discussion that
    Trotsky’s formulation of thesis 41 on this point was
    theoretically wrong, because it implied priority in production and
    equalisation in consumption. I replied that priority implied
    preference and that that was nothing unless you also had it in
    consumption. Comrade Trotsky reproached me for
    “extraordinary forgetfulness” and
    “intimidation” (pp. 67 and 68), and I am surprised to
    find that he has not accused me also of manoeuvring, diplomatic
    moves, etc. He has made “concessions” to my
    equalitarian line, but I have attacked him.
Actually, however, anyone who takes an interest in Party
    affairs, can turn to indisputable Party documents: the November
    resolution of the C.C. Plenum, point 4, and Trotsky’s
    platform pamphlet, thesis 41. However “forgetful” I
    may be, and however excellent Comrade Trotsky’s memory, it
    is still a fact that thesis 41 contains a theoretical error, which
    the C.C. resolution of November 9 does not. The resolution says:
    “While recognising the necessity of keeping to the principle
    of priority in carrying out the economic plan, the Central
    Committee, in complete solidarity with the decisions of the last
    All-Russia Conference (September), deems it necessary to effect a
    gradual but steady transition to equality in the status of various
    groups of workers and their respective trade unions, all the while
    building up the organisation on the scale of the union as a
    whole.” That is clearly aimed against Tsektran, and it is
    quite impossible to put any other construction on the exact
    meaning of the resolution. Priority is here to stay. Preference is
    still to be given to enterprises, trade unions, trusts and
    departments on the priority list (in regard to fulfilment of the
    economic plan), but at the same time, the “equalitarian
    line”—which was supported not by “Comrade Lenin
    alone”, but was approved by the Party Conference and the
    Central Committee, that is, the entire Party—makes this
    clear-cut demand: get on with the gradual but steady
    transition to equalisation. That Tsektran failed to carry
    out this C.C. resolution (November) is evident from the Central
    Committee’s December resolution (on Trotsky and
    Bukharin’s motion), which contains another reminder of the
    “principles of ordinary democracy”. The theoretical
    error in thesis 41 is that it says: equalisation in consumption,
    priority in production. That is an economic absurdity because it
    implies a gap between production and consumption. I did not
    say—and could never have said—anything of the sort. If
    you don’t need a factory, close it down. Close down all the
    factories that are not absolutely essential, and give preference
    to those that are. Give preference to, say, transport. Most
    certainly. But the preference must not be overdone, as it was in
    Tsektran’s case, which was why the Party (and not
    just Lenin) issued this directive: get on with the
    gradual but steady transition to equality.

      And Trotsky has no one but himself to blame for having come
      out—after the November Plenary Meeting, which gave a
      clear-cut and theoretically correct solution—with a
      factional pamphlet on “the two trends” and proposed a
      formulation in his thesis 41 which is wrong in economic
      terms. 
*     *

Today, January 25, it is exactly one month since Comrade
    Trotsky’s factional statement. It is now patent that this
    pronouncement, inappropriate in form and wrong in essence, has
    diverted the Party from its practical economic and production
    effort into rectifying political and theoretical mistakes. But,
    it’s an ill wind, as the old saying goes.
Rumour has it that some terrible things have been said about
    the disagreements on the Central Committee. Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries undoubtedly shelter (and have sheltered)
    behind the opposition, and it is they who are spreading the
    rumours, incredibly malicious formulations, and inventions of all
    sorts to malign the Party, put vile interpretations on its
    decisions, aggravate conflicts and ruin its work. That is a
    political trick used by the bourgeoisie, including the
    petty-bourgeois democrats, the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, who, for very obvious reasons,
    hate—and cannot help hating—the Bolsheviks’
    guts. Every intelligent member of the Party is familiar with this
    political trick, and knows its worth.
Because of the disagreements on the Central Committee, it had
    to appeal to the Party, and the discussions that followed clearly
    revealed the essence and scope of these disagreements. That killed
    the rumours and the slander. The Party learns its lessons and is
    tempered in the struggle against factionalism, a new malaise (it
    is new in the sense that after the October Revolution we had
    forgotten all about it). Actually, it is an old malaise, with
    relapses apparently bound to occur over the next few years, but
    with an easier cure now well in sight.
The Party is learning not to blow up its disagreements. Let me
    quote at this point Comrade Trotsky’s correct remark about
    Comrade Tomsky: “I have always said —even when the
    polemic against Comrade Tomsky was at its bitterest—that it
    is quite clear to me that only men with his experience and
    authority ought to be our trade union leaders. I told this to the
    Party group of the Fifth Conference of the Trade Unions, and
    repeated it at the Zimin theatre a few days ago. Ideological
    struggle within the Party does not mean mutual ostracism but
    mutual influence”[4] (p. 34 of the report on the December
    30 discussion). The Party will naturally apply this correct
    approach to Comrade Trotsky himself.
During the discussion it was Comrade Shlyapnikov and his group,
    the so-called Workers’ Opposition, who showed the most
    pronounced syndicalist trend. This being an obvious deviation from
    communism and the Party, we shall have to reckon with it, talk it
    over, and make a special propaganda effort to explain the error of
    these views and the danger of making such mistakes. Comrade
    Bukharin, who actually coined the syndicalist phrase
    “mandatory nominations” (by trade unions to management
    bodies) tries to vindicate himself in today’s issue of
    Pravda, but I’m afraid his line of defence is
    highly ineffective and quite wrong. He wants us to know, you see,
    that he deals with the role of the Party in his other points. I
    should think so! If it were otherwise it would have been more than
    just a mistake, requiring correction and allowing some
    slight rectification: it would have been withdrawal from the
    Party. When you say “mandatory nominations” but
    neglect to add, there and then, that they are not
    mandatory for the Party, you have a syndicalist deviation, and
    that is incompatible with communism and the Party
    Programme If you add: “mandatory but not for the
    Party” you are giving the non-Party workers a false sense of
    having some increase in their rights, whereas in fact there will
    be no change at all. The longer Comrade Bukharin persists in his
    deviation from communism—a deviation that is wrong
    theoretically and deceptive politically—the more deplorable
    will be the fruits of his obstinacy. You cannot maintain an
    untenable proposition. The Party does not object to the extension
    of the rights of the non-Party workers in general, but a little
    reflection will show what can and what cannot be done in this
    respect. 
In the discussion by the Communist group of the Second
    All-Russia Miners’ Congress, Shlyapnikov’s platform
    was defeated despite the backing it got from Comrade Kiselyov, who
    commands special prestige in that union: our platform won 137
    votes, Shlyapnikov’s, 62, and Trotsky’s, 8. The
    syndicalist malaise must and will be cured.
In this one month, Petrograd, Moscow and a number of provincial
    towns have shown that the Party responded to the discussion and
    has rejected Comrade Trotsky’s wrong line by an overwhelming
    majority. While there may have been some vacillation “at the
    top” and “in the provinces”, in the committees
    and in the offices, the rank-and-file membership—the mass of
    Party workers—came out solidly against this wrong line.
Comrade Kamenev informed me of Comrade Trotsky’s
    announcement, during the discussion in the Zamoskvorechye District
    of Moscow on January 23, that he was withdrawing his platform and
    joining up with the Bukharin group on a new
    platform. Unfortunately, I heard nothing of this from Comrade
    Trotsky either on January 23 or 24, when he spoke against me in
    the Communist group of the Miners’ Congress. I don’t
    know whether this is due to another change in Comrade
    Trotsky’s platform and intentions, or to some other
    reason. In any case, his January 23 announcement shows that the
    Party, without so much as mustering all its forces, and with only
    Petrograd, Moscow and a minority of the provincial towns going on
    record, has corrected Comrade Trotsky’s mistake promptly and
    with determination.
The Party’s enemies had rejoiced too soon. They have not
    been able—and will never be able—to take advantage of
    some of the inevitable disagreements within the Party to inflict
    harm on it and on the dictatorship of the proletariat in
    Russia.

    Lenin began writing the pamphlet on January 21 or 22, 1921, in
    Gorki where he was taking a rest. Upon his return to Moscow on
    January 22, he handed the greater part of the pamphlet to his
    secretary for typing. He finished the work on January 25 and had
    it sent to the printer’s. Late on January 26, C.C. members
    who were going to attend local discussions of the trade
    unions’ role and tasks were given copies of the printed
    pamphlet, while the rest of the copies were ready on January
    27.

Petrogradskaya Pravda (Petrograd Truth
    )—a daily published from April 2, 1918, as the organ of
    the Bolshevik Central and Petrograd Party Committees. Since
    January 1924, it has been appearing as Leningradskaya
    Pravda.

    V. I. Zoff’s circular of May 3, 1920, was published in the
    Bulleten Mariinskogo Oblastnogo Upravlenia Vodnogo
    Transporta (Bulletin of the Mariinsky Regional Water
    Transport Administration ) No. 5, 1920. It ran: “A
    great change is about to occur in the life of water transport:
    primitive methods, committee treadmill, haphazard work and anarchy
    are on the way out. Water transport is becoming a state
    enterprise, headed by political commissars with appropriate
    powers. Committees, trade unions and elected delegates will no
    longer have the power to interfere in technical and administrative
    matters.” 
[3b] By the way, it would be a good thing, first,
    if the current edition of Plekhanov’s works contained a
    special volume or volumes of all his philosophical articles, with
    detailed indexes, etc., to be included in a series of standard
    textbooks on communism; secondly I think the workers’ state
    must demand that professors of philosophy should have a knowledge
    of Plekhanov’s exposition of Marxist philosophy and ability
    to impart it to their students. But all that is a digression from
    “propaganda” to
    “administration”—Lenin. 
[3c]Incidentally, here again Trotsky makes a
    mistake. He thinks that an industrial union is designed to control
    industry. That is wrong. When you say that a union is an
    industrial one you mean that it admits to membership workers in
    one industry, which is inevitable at the present level of
    technology and culture (in Russia and
    elsewhere).—Lenin. 
The order was an example of administration by
    injunction and bureaucratic practices, which Tsektran’s
    leadership was introducing, and was evidence of their
    misunderstanding of the trade unions’ role in getting
    transport back on its feet. The trade unions were equated with
    outdated army committees, and barred by order from taking part in
    improving water transport operations.
[4]
    On December 24, 1920, in what used to be the Zimin theatre,
    Trotsky gave a report on the trade unions tasks in production at a
    joint meeting of trade union activists and delegates to the Eighth
    All-Russia Congress of Soviets, called by the Central Committee of
    the Joint Union of Rail and Water Transport Workers. It started
    the open Party discussion on the trade unions.

I regret that I am unable to participate in the work of your 
Conference and that I must confine myself to a brief statement of my 
views.
From the speeches the comrades have delivered here I gather that you
want to know all about the sowing campaign. Very many people think that
there is something tricky about the Soviet government’s policy
towards the peasants. Our policy in this sphere is one that we are always
ready to reveal to the masses. The fundamental problem of the Soviet power
is that our own victories have not yet been followed by victories in other
countries. If you give our Constitution a careful reading, you will see
that we have not made any fantastic promises, but insist on the need for
dictatorship, because the whole bourgeois world is against us.
We are told: the peasants’ condition is not the same as that of
the workers, there is some trick in this. But it is one that we have
openly proclaimed.
Anyone who has stopped to think of the relation of forces between
ourselves and the bourgeoisie knows that they are stronger; yet, for three
years, they have been unable to crush us. That is not a miracle; we do not
believe in miracles. The simple truth is that they cannot unite, and are
quarrelling over the division of the spoils. Most of the oppressed
countries are colonies, and a minority live on their labour, but atop a
volcano.
They are stronger, but the movement is growing over there as well. The
capitalists have a stronger military force, but they have had a set-back,
and we say: the worst

      is over, but the enemy will make further attempts. Of the Europeans who
      have visited us none has claimed that his country could have avoided the
      rags and the queues; and they all agree that, after six years of war, even
      Britain would have been in a similar state.
We must do our best to establish proper relations between the wor1srs
and the peasants. The peasants are another class. We shall have socialism
when there are no classes, when all the means of production belong to the
working people. We still have classes, it will take many, many years to
abolish them, and only a quack will promise to do it overnight. The
peasants prefer to go it alone, each one on his own farm, and with his own
stock of corn. This givss them power over everybody. An armed enemy is
lying in wait for us, and if we are to prevent him from overthrowing us,
we must establish proper relations between the workers and the
peasants.
If you take the workers and the peasants, you will find that the latter
are more numerous. The capitalists claim to have a democracy under which
workers and peasants enjoy equal rights. So long as the peasants follow
the bourgeoisie and the workers are isolated, they will be defeated. If we
forget that, the capitalists will beat us. We have not promised equality,
and we have not got it. There can be no equality so long as one has plenty
of corn and the other has none.
The capitalists realised that you can share out the land, but not the
factories. We have a dictatorship of the prole-tariat, a term that scares
the peasants, but it is the only means of uniting them and making them
fellow the lead of the workers. We believe this is the correct solution,
and the working class will succeed in uniting the peasantry. Only then
will the road be open to further advance towards the abolition of
classes.
What is the policy of the American capitalists? They are doling out
land, and the peasants follow them and are lulled by their talk of
equality. Either you are duped in this fashion, or you see through it,
unite with the workers and drive out the capitalists.
This is our policy, and you will find it in our Constitu-tion. 1 was
told here that we ought to review the sowing campaign plans. I know that
this spring the peasants are having it very bad. For the workers, the
worst is over. We have not promised equality to anyone: if you want to be
with the workers, come with us, come over to the socialist side; if not,
go over to the Whites. We never promised a liberal regime; the one we have
has helped us to escape the bondage of the landowners and capitalists.
During these three years the workers starved and froze, and took over the
idle factories. But they also got the power. Even the peasants in the
fertile areas came to see the difference between the workers’ rule
and Denikin’s, and they have made their choice. Our victory over
Denikin was not a miracle; it was due to the fact that even the rich
peasants realised what the Constituent Assembly had come to; this drove
home the point that the proof of the pudding was in the eating.
The peasants realised that the more territory the Whites seized, the
more peasants would he drafted into the army, and as soon as enough of
them had been collected in the army, they overthrew Denikin.
We do not promise a land flowing with milk and honey. But over there
you are promised equality, and get saddled with a landowner. That is why
we won.
We are told we ought to review our plans for the sowing campaign. I
say: nobody has suffered as much as the workers. During this period, the
peasants received land and could obtain corn. This winter the peasants are
in desperate straits and their discontent is understandable.
Let us review the relations between the workers and the peasants. We
have said that the workers have made incredible sacrifices. This year the
peasants are in a terrible plight, and we know it. We are not opposed to
reviewing these relations. What is the main goal of the sowing cam-paign?
It is to sow all the land, otherwise we are surely doomed. Do you know how
much grain has been taken from the peasants this year? About three hundred
million poods. What would the working class have done without it? Even so
it starved. We know that the conditions of the peasants are hard, but
there is no other way out of the situation. We have completely suspended
the surplus grain appropriation system in thirteen gubernias. Last year we 
supplied eight million poods of seed grain, and after the harvest we got 
back six million poods. Now we have supplied approximately fifteen million. 
To cancel the sowing campaign would be like jumping out of a fifth storey 
window. We cannot promise the peasants to relieve them of want at a stroke; 
to do that our factories would have to multiply their output a 
hundredfold.
If we did not give the workers even the short ration they are now
getting, industry would have ground down to a stop.
It is true that for three years the workers got nothing at all. But
there is no cure-all.
The working class has been exhausted by these three years, and this
spring will be a very hard one for the peasants. But you help us with the
sowing campaign-to sow all the fields-then we shall manage to overcome our
difficulties.
In Hungary, the peasants failed to help the Hungarian workers and fell
under the power of the landowners.
There is the alternative before you. What is the way out of this
difficult situation? It is to concentrate efforts on the sowing campaign,
point out the mistakes, and make corrections; otherwise there is no way
out of the difficulties.

[1] The Conference was held in Trade Union House on February 4, 1921, arid was attended by about 1,000 delegates from Moscow and Moscow Gubernia. In view of the acute food crisis, the main reports dealt with the food situation and the working-class atti-tude to the peasantry. Wage rates and the trade unions’ role in production were also discussed. A resolution adopted on the report about the relations between the workers and the peasants stressed the need to substitute a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system. The Menshevik and S. R. delegates tried to use the country’s difficulties to incite the delegates against the Soviet Government’s economic policy and against the Communist Party but were rebuffed by the Conference. At the delegates’ request, Lenin addressed the final sitting of the Conference.

Comrades, it gives me great pleasure to greet your Congress
on behalf of the Central Committee of our Party and of the Council of
Peoples Commissars. What gives me oven greater pleasure is your unanimous
decision of yesterday, following the happy reconciliation and successful
resolution of the conflict and the friction among you, which required such
strenuous efforts from all, and some from our Party as well. I am sure,
comrades, that this slight clash and its successful settlement will be an
earnest that in your future work, as members of the union and of the
Party, you will be able to solve all the numerous difficulties and
problems that still lie ahead of us.
Comrades, speaking of the position of our Republic in general of the
internal and external position of the Soviet power—the greatest
difficulties that confronted us were, of course, those of our external
positions. The greatest difficulties of the entire proletarian revolution
in Russia arose from our having had to take the initiative in the
socialist revolution due to the course of the imperialist war and the
preceding development of the first revolution in 1905; this imposed
unprecedented difficulties on us, and on our country. You all know, of
course—I think that in your branch of industry this is more evident
to you than to the workers of other industries—you all know to what
extent capital is an international force, to what extent all the big
capitalist enterprises, factories, shops, etc., all over the world are
linked up together; this makes it obvious that in substance capital cannot
be completely defeated in one country. It is an international force, and
in order to rout it the workers must also make a concerted effort on an
international scale. Ever since 1917, when we fought the
bourgeois-republican governments in Russia, and ever since the power of
the Soviets was established at the end of 1917, we have been telling the
workers again and again that the cardinal task, and the fundamental
condition of our victory is to spread the revolution to, at least, a few
of the most advanced countries. And our main difficulties over the past
four years have been due to the fact that the West European capitalists
managed to bring the war to an end and stave oft revolution.
We in Russia had paticuiarly striking evidence of the extremely
precarious position of the bourgeoisie during the imperialist war. We also
heard that in all other countries it was the end of the war that marked
the intensification of the political crisis, for then the people were
armed and it was an opportune moment for the proletariat to have done with
the capitalists at one stroke. For a number of reasons the West European
workers failed to do this, and for nearly four years now we have had to
defend our positions single-handed.
As a consequence, the difficulties that fell to the lot of the Soviet
Republic of Russia were without number, because the military forces of the
capitalists of the whole world (vastly superior to our own, of course) did
all they possibly could to help our landowners. We know full well of the
incredible hardships and privations the working class of Russia has had to
bear, but if we are emerging today from more than three years of
successfully repulsing their military invasions and overcoming their
obstructions, we have a perfect right to say without any exaggeration that
the worst of our difficulties are behind us. 11 in spite of their
overwhelming military superiority, the capitalists of the world have
failed to crush this weak and backward country in the course of three
years, it was only because we have had the dictatorship of the proletariat
and enjoyed the massive sympathy of the working people all over the world,
we can safely say, in every country without exception. And if the
capitalists of the whole world have failed in their attempt to crush
Soviet Russia, which was not a hard task for them because of their
enormous military superiority, we can say, I repeat, that in the
international sphere, the greatest danger-point of the whole Soviet
revolution is past, the worst difficulties are over.
The danger is still there, of course; the negotiations for final peace
are still dragging on and there are signs that a rather difficult period
in these negotiations is setting in, for the French imperialists, in
particular, are pressing on with their efforts to push Poland into another
war, and are spreading all sorts of false rumours about Soviet Russia not
wanting peace.
Actually, we have done everything to prove that we do; we signed the
provisional terms several months ago, and they were such that everyone was
surprised by our spirit of compromise. We are not going back on any point
of these terms, but we shall certainly refuse to be soaked under the
pretext of a division of the property which under tsarism had belonged to
the Polish and to the Russian people, which at the time both groaned under
the yoke of tsarism. That is something we cannot have. We accept a fair
division of the property, which is to be regarded as common, and a part of
the railway property, and consider as indisputable the need to restore to
the Polish people all objects of cultural value to which they attach
especial importance, and which had been stolen and carried off to Russia
in the days of the tsar. We have always anticipated that difficult
problems would arise in the settlement of this matter; but if under the
pressure of the French imperialists the Poles want to create a conflict
and sabotage peace at all costs, there is nothing we can do about it. If
there is to be peace, good will must be shown on both sides, whether in
the ease of a very serious conflict within a separate alliance or between
two states. If the Poles once again yield to the pressure of the French
imperialists, then, I repeat, the effort to conclude peace may be
frustrated. You are well aware, of course, what new difficulties will
confront us if the French imperialists succeed in sabotaging this peace;
and we all know from a number of sources and reports that attempts are
being made and enormous efforts are being exerted to this end, and that
the foreign capitalists are spending millions upon millions to organise
another invasion of Soviet Russia in the spring. We now have over three
years’ experience of the way these invasions are organised. We know
that unless they have the aid of a neighbouring state, the foreign
capitalists cannot hope to organise anything like a serious expedition,
and the millions they have been handing out to the various groups headed
by Savinkov, or to the group of Socialist-Revolutionaries who are
publishing their newspaper in Prague[2] and sometimes speak in
the name of the Constituent Assembly, these millions will go down the
drain, and they will have nothing to show for it but a lot of spoiled
newsprint and wasted ink in various printing offices in Prague.
But there are countries like Rumania, which has not tried to fight
Russia, and Poland, which is ruled by an exploiting class and a military
clique of adventurers. We know that they cannot muster large forces
against us, but we also know that what we prize most is peace and an
opportunity to devote all our efforts to restoring our economy, So we must
be extremely careful. We have the right to tell ourselves that the worst
difficulties in international politics are behind us, but it would be
extremely thoughtless to shut our eyes to the possibility of fresh
attempts. Of course, now that we have eliminated the Wrangel front, and
R0mania had not risked war when the odds were on her side, it is hardly
likely that she will risk it now; but we must not forget that the ruling
classes in Rumania and Poland are in a position which may be said to be
bordering on the desperate. Both countries have been sold to foreign
capitalists lock, stock, and barrel. Both are up to their ears in debt,
and have no means of paying up. Their bankruptcy is inevitable. The
revolutionary movement of the workers and peasants is growing steadily.
Bourgeois governments in such straits have been known to rush headlong
into the craziest adventures, for which there was no other explanation but
their desperate and hopeless situation. That is why we must still reckon
with the possibility of fresh attempts at armed invasion.
Our conviction that these attempts will be frustrated, and that the
position of the capitalist powers all over the world is, generally
speaking, precarious, springs chiefly from the mounting economic crisis in
all countries, and the growth of the communist working-class movement.

In Europe, the revolution has not been following the same lines as
ours. As I have said, the workers and peasants or the West European
countries, who were in arms when the war ended, failed to strike in a
swift revolution that would have been the least painful. The imperialist
war, however, had so shaken the position of these states that not only has
the economic crisis there not yet run its course, but there are signs that
in every country without exception, even in the richest and most advanced,
it will become even more acute next spring. Capital is an international
evil, and just because of this all countries find themselves so grappled
to each other that when some go down they tend to drag down the rest.
The rich countries have naturally waxed richer: during the war their
capitalists piled up huge profits. But in the overwhelming majority of the
European countries, trade has been dislocated and disrupted owing to the
complete devastation not only of Russia, but even of Germany, and owing to
the depression and the currency depreciation. The richest countries are
suliocating, being unable to sell their industrial goods because of the
depreciating currency, unomploymont is growing to incredible proportions
everywhere, and an unprecedented economic crisis is looming all over the
world.
Meanwhile, the working class—which its capitalists had bribed by
giving sizable hand-outs from their profits to the upper strata of the
working class to entice it away from the revolution—is recovering
from its blindness after the three-and-a-half-year war against Soviet
Russia, while the communist movement is growing steadily and taking on
depth not only in the parties, but also in the trade unions all over the
world, although not as fast as we should like. The ruling classes all over
the world are particularly apprehensive of the changes that are taking
place in the trade union movement. In Europe, they are not afraid of the
prospect of facing a party that could lead the revolutionary proletariat,
as was the case in the Russian revolution, when in the course of a few
months, no, weeks, the Party was transformed from an illegal one into one
commanding nation-wide forces, and backed by millions of people. Europe
has net had such a party for years. But every capitalist sees the trade
unions, and knows that they unite millions of workers and that the
machinery of capitalism is bound to break down, unless the capitalists
control them through the leaders who call themselves socialists but pursue
the policy of the capitalists. This they know, feel and sense. The most
telltale fact, for instance, was that in Germany the whole bourgeois press
and the whole press of the social-traitors meeting in the Second
International and calling themselves socialists, but loyally serving the
capitalists, was whipped into a frenzy not so much because of
Zinoviev’s.visit to Germany, as of that of the Russian trade
unionists, for no one has stirred up the German trade unions to such an
extent as they did on their first short visit to that country. This savage
fury of the German bourgeois press and all the Communist-hating
capitalists shows how precarious their position is. An international,
world-wide struggle has flared up for influence with the trade unions,
with millions of members in all civilised countries, for on them depends
this inner work, which is not always readily perceptible. The inexorable
growth of the economic crisis is deciding the fate of the capitalist
countries.
The attempted coup[3] by the German monarchist party was
thwarted by the resistance of the German trade unions, when the workers
who had followed Scheidemann and the murderers of Liebknecht and Luxemburg
rose and crushed the military forces. As the economic crisis gains
momentum, we find the same thing happening in Great Britain, and to a
large extent in America as well. That is why it is the international
situation that gives us most hope and conviction that the internal
situation in the capitalist countries tends to sap all of their strength,
and that our international position, which was difficult yesterday and
remains such today, despite our great successes, will undoubtedly improve,
and that we shall be able to devote all our efforts to solving our
internal tasks. I shall not enlarge on these tasks, because all of you who
are engaged in industry are more familiar with the tasks of construction
than I am, and it would be superfluous for me to deal with them at length.

    

      I heard the final remark made by the preceding speaker, and I join him in
      saying that every member must now concentrate most attention on the
      practical tasks of production and economic construction now before us. The
      trade unions now unite nearly all the industrial workers; they unite the
      class that has borne the brunt of the burden of the past three years. In
      Russia, the working class is exercising its dictatorship; it is the ruling
      class in a country where workers are in a minority. But it is precisely
      because the working class is ruling the country and because the workers
      had borne the brunt of capitalist exploitation, that it is assured of the
      sympathy and massive support of the working peasantry and all those who do
      not live on the labour of others. This explains what is a sealed book not
      only to the capitalists but also to the socialists who have remained
      enemies of the Third International, and what they take to be a trick on
      the part of our government. They cannot understand how the working class
      could fight on for three years, against enormous odds, and beat them. But
      the majority of the peasants must support the working class because the
      workers have come to power for the first time in history, and because
      power has been taken by the class that had been most exploited. They have
      realised that the working class is right, and have withdrawn their support
      from the bourgeoisie, which, by the way, they regard as a term of abuse. I
      met a peasant who complained about present conditions and was obviously
      not in sympathy with the Soviet government’s food policy, and
      certain other issues. The poor peasants of his district had called him a
      "bourgeois", and he felt this to be an affront. "I refuse to be called by
      such a disgraceful name," he said. And there is a world of meaning in the
      fact that this term has come to be regarded as an odious one by the
      peasants—even the well-to-do middle peasants who have worked with
      their own hands, who know what it takes to earn a living, and who have
      been exploited by landowners and capitalists (and that is something they
      have all experienced). It is the basis of our propaganda and agitation,
      and the influence exercised by the working class through the state. It is
      this support of the peasant masses that the working class is assured of in
      spite of the resistance of the rich and profiteering crowd. And that is
      why our trade unions are not only associations of working people, not only
      the builders of our economy—that is their main task—but also a
      political force building a new state without landowners and capitalists.
      Although a minority, they can and will build a new communist society,
      because we are assured of the support of the millions upon millions of
      those who have always lived by their own labour. In greeting your
      Congress, I want to say that I am quite sure that we shall succeed in our
      tasks despite all the difficulties confronting us. (Prolonged
      applause.)

Endnotes
[1] The
      Congress was held in Moscow on February 16, 1921, and was attended by 287
      delegates. The items on the agenda were: activity of the trade
      union’s Central Committee; economic tasks; output norms;
      international trade union federation, etc. The Congress sent a message of
      greetings to Lenin.
Lenin addressed the ninth plenary sitting on the
morning of February 6, and mentioned a conflict which had arisen at a
Communist group meeting to discuss nominations for the new trade union
Central Committee. The disagreements were so acute that the Party’s
CC. deemed it necessary to step in.
[2]  The
reference is to the newspaper Volya Rossii (The Will of Russia). It was
the Central Organ of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, and was
published in Prague from September 12, 1920, to October 9, 1921. 
[3]The
reference is to the monarchist Kapp putsch in Germany in March 1920,
organised by a reactionary military clique headed by Kapp. The Kapp
government fell after a few days under pressure from the workers.

1. Unreservedly adhering to the position defined by the Programme of
the R.C.P. in regard to polytechnical education (see, in particular,
§ 1 and 8 of the section dealing with education), the Party must
regard the lowering of the ago for general and polytechnical education
from seventeen to fifteen as only a practical expedient necessitated by
the country’s poverty and ruin caused by the wars imposed upon us by
the Entente.
Vocational training for persons. of fifteen years of age and upwards
’in conjunction with ... general polytechnical education" ( 8
mentioned above) is absolutely compulsory all over the country, wherever
there is the slightest oppor-tunity to introduce it.
2. The main failing of the People’s Commissariat for Education is
its lack of practical efficiency, inadequate attention to the recording
and verification of practical experience, lack of systematic application
of its lessons, and prevalence of general arguments and abstract slogans.
The People’s Commissar and the Collegium must concentrate on
combating these defects.
3. The enlistment of specialists, i.e., of teachers with theoretical
and long practical experience, and of persons having such experience in
technical (including agronomic) vocational training for work at the
centre, is improperly organised in the People’s Commissariat for
Education in genera], and in Glavprofobr, [The Chief
Administration for Vocational Training under the People’s
Commissariat for Education—Editor] in
particular.
The registration of such workers, the study of their experience, the
verification of the results of their work, and their systematic enlistment
for responsible posts in local, and specially central, work must be
organised immediately. Not a single serious measure should be carried out
without canvassing the opinion of these specialists and obtaining their
continued co-operation.
It goes without saying that the enlistment of specialists must be
carried out under these two indispensable con-ditions: first, specialists
who are not Communists must work under the control of Communists;
secondly, Commu-nists alone must determine the content of the curricula,
in so far as this concerns general educational subjects, and particularly
philosophy, the social sciences and communist education.
4. Curricula for the main types of educational establishments and for
courses, lectures, readings, colloquia and practice periods must he drawn
up and endorsed by the Collegium and the People’s Commissar.
5. The Standard Labour School Department, and, in particular,
Glavprofobr, must devote greater attention to the wider and more
systematic enlistment of all suitable technical and agronomic forces for
the promotion of technical vocational and polytechnical education and to
the utilisation for that purpose of every tolerably well-organised
industrial and agricultural enterprise (state farm, agricultural
experimental station, well-organised farm, etc., electric power stations,
etc.).
To avoid disruption of normal operations, the forms and the order in
which economic enterprises and establishments are to be used for
polytechnical education are to be determined by agreement with the
economic agencies concerned.
(3. Clear, concise and practical forms of reporting must be devised to
make it possible to estimate the scale and verify the results of the work.
The organisation of this work in the People’s Commissariat for
Education is highly unsatisfactory.
7. The distribution of newspapers, pamphlets, magazines and books to
libraries and reading-rooms in schools and elsewhere is also highly
unsatisfactory. The result is that  newspapers and books reach only a
small section of Soviet office workers and extremely few factory workers
and peasants. This whole system must be reorganised from top to
bottom.

Pravda No. 25 of February  5 carried
      “Instructions of the Central Committee of the
      R.C.P. to Communists Working in the People’s Commissariat
      for Education (in connection with the reorganisation of the
      Commissariat)”

      Unfortunately, there are three misprints in Point I distorting
      the meaning: the text said political" instead of
      ”polytechnical“ education.

      I should like to draw our comrades’ attention to these
      instructions and to call for an exchange of opinion on some of
      the more important points.

      A five-day Party Conference on educational questions was held in
      December 1920. It was attended by 134 delegates with voice and
      vote, and 29 with voice. A report of its proceedings is given in
      a Supplement to the Bulletin of the Eighth Congress of
      Soviets on the Party Conference on Education (published by
      the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, January 10,
      1921). The resolutions of the Conference, the report of the
      proceedings, all the articles published in the above-mentioned
      Supplement—except for the introductory article by
      Comrade Lunacharsky and the article by Comrade Grinko reveal a
      wrong approach to polytechnical education. They suffer from the
      very defect on combating which the Central Committee in its
      instruc tions urges the People’s Commissar and the
      Collegium to concentrate their attention, namely, too many
      genera’ arguments and abstract slogans.

      The question of polytechnical education has in the main been
      settled by our Party Programme in its paragraphs 1 and 8 of the
      section dealing with the people’s education.

      It is these paragraphs that are dealt with in the Central
      Committee’s Instructions. Paragraph I deals with
      polytech meal education up to the age of seventeen; and
      Paragraph 8 speaks of “the extensive development of
      vocational training for persons of the age of seventeen and
      upwards in conjunction with general polytechnical
      education”. 

      Thus, the Party Programme puts the question squarely. The
      arguments about "polytechnical or monotechnical
      education" (the words I have put in quotes and italics,
      monstrously absurd though they are, are the very words that we
      find on page 4 of the Supplement) are fundamentally
      wrong and downright impermissible for a Communist; they betray
      ignorance of the Programme and an idle inclination for abstract
      slogans. While we are temporarily compelled to lower the age
      (for passing from general polytechnical education to
      polytechnical vocational training) from seventeen to
      fifteen, the "Party must regard" this lowering of the
      age “as only" (point I of the Central Committees
      Instructions) a practical expedient necessitated by the
      "country’s poverty and ruin”. 

      General arguments with futile efforts to “substantiate"
      this lowering are claptrap. Lot us stop this game of general
      arguments and “theorising"! Attention must be concentrated
      on the “recording and verification of practical
      experience" and the “systematic application oJ its
      lessons”. 

      We may have very few competent people with knowledge and
      practical pedagogical experience but we do have some. We suffer
      from our inability to find them, install them in the proper
      executive posts, and join them in studying the practical
      experience of Soviet state development. Now this is precisely
      what the Party Conference in December 1920 failed to do, and if
      this was not done at a conference of 163—one hundred and
      sixty three!—educational workers, it is quite evident that
      there must be a general, fundamental flaw in the organisation of
      this work, which made it necessary for the Party’s Central
      Committee to issue special instructions.

      In the Commissariat for Education there are two—just
      two—comrades who have special assignments. These are the
      People’s Commissar, Comrade Lunacharsky, who exercises
      general direction, and Deputy Commissar, Comrade Pokrovsky, who
      directs affairs, firstly, as Deputy People’s Commissar,
      and secondly, as official adviser (and director) on scientific
      matters and questions of Marxism in general. The whole Party
      knows both Comrade Lunacharsky and Comrade Pokrovsky very well
      and has no doubt, of course, that in this respect both are, in
      their way, “specialists" in the People’s
      Commissariat for Education. None of the other workers of the
      Commissariat can afford to “specialise" in this way: their
      “speciality’ must lie in skilfully organising the
      enlistment of expert teachers, in organising their work
      properly, and in systematically applying the lessons of
      practical experience. The Central Committee’s instructions
      refer to this in points 2, 3 and 5.

      The Party workers’ conference should have heard reports by
      specialists-teachers with some ten years’ practical
      experience who could have told us what is being clone and has
      been done in the various spheres, say, vocational training, how
      we are coping with it in our Soviet organisation, what has been
      achieved, illustrated with examples (which could surely be
      found, even if in small number), what were the main defects, and
      how these could be removed, stated in concrete terms.

      The Party workers’ conference made no such record of
      practical experience, and heard no teachers on their
      application of this experience; but fatuous efforts were made to
      produce “general arguments" and appraise “abstract
      slogans”.  The whole Party, all the workers of the
      People’s Commissariat for Education, must realise this
      defect and correct it in a common effort. Local workers should
      exchange experience and help the Party to give publicity to the
      exemplary guhernias, uyezds, districts, schools, or expert
      teachers who have achieved good results in o relatively narrow,
      local or special field. Taking as a basis the achievements that
      have stood the test of practice, we must press on and, after
      proper verification, apply this local experience on a
      nation-wide scale, promoting talented, or simply capable,
      teachers to more responsible posts, giving them a wider sphere
      of activity, etc. 

      The touchstone of a Communist’s work in education (and
      educational institutions) should be his efforts in organising
      the enlistment of specialists, his ability to find them, utilise
      their knowledge, secure the cooperation of expert teachers with
      the Communist leadership, and verify what and how much is
      being done. He must show ability to make
      progress—even if very slowly and on a very small
      scale—so long as it is achieved in practical
      matters, on the basis of practical experience. But we
      shall not move forward if the People’s Commissariat for
      Education continues to be full of people who pretend to provide
      ’Communist leadership" while there is a vacuum in the
      practical sphere, a shortage, or total lack, of practical
      specialists, inability to promote them, hear what they have to
      say and take account of their experience. The Communist leader
      must prove his claim to leadership by recruiting a growing
      number of experienced teachers to help him, and by showing his
      ability to help them. in their work, to promote them, and take
      account of and bring out their experience.

      In this sense the invariable slogan must be: less
      “leadership”, more practical work, that is to say,
      fewer general arguments and more facts, and I mean verified
      facts, showing where, when and what progress we are making or
      whether we are marking time, or retreating. The Communist who is
      a real leader will correct the curricula drawn up by the
      experienced teachers, compile a good textbook and achieve
      practical, even if slight, improvements in the content
      of the work of a score, a hundred, or a thousand expert
      teachers. But there is not much use in the Communist who
      talks about “leadership”, but is incapable
      of enlisting any specialists for practical work, getting them to
      achieve practical results in their work, and utilising
      the practical experience gained by hundreds upon hundreds of
      teachers.

      That this is the main flaw in the work of the People’s
      Commissariat for Education is evident from a paging through the
      fine booklet, The People’s Commissariat for
      Education. October 1917—October 1920. Brie! Report.
      Comrade Lunacharsky admits this when he refers in the preface
      (p. 5) to the “obvious lack of the practical
      approach”.  But much more effort will be needed to drive
      this home to all the Communists in the People’s
      Commissariat for Education and make them practise these
      truths. This booklet shows that our knowledge of the facts is
      poor, very poor indeed; we do not know how to collect them; we
      are unable to judge how many questions we ought to raise and the
      number of answers we can expect to get (taking into
      consideration our level of culture, our customs, and our moans
      of communication). We don’t know how to collect evidence
      of practical experience and sum it up. We indulge in empty
      “general arguments and abstract slogans”, but do not
      know how to utilise the services of competent teachers, in
      general, and of competent engineers and agronomists for
      technical education, in particular; we don’t know how to
      utilise factories, state farms, tolerably well-organised
      enterprises and electric power stations for the purpose of
      polytechnical education.

      In spite of these defects, the Soviet Republic is making
      progress in public education; there is no doubt about
      that. There is a mighty urge for light and knowledge “down
      below”, that is to say, among the mass of working people
      whom capitalism had been hypocritically cheating out of an
      education and depriving of it by open violence. We call be proud
      that we are promoting and fostering this urge. But it would be a
      real crime to ignore the defects in our work, and the fact that
      we have not yet learned properly to organise the state apparatus
      of education.

      Take also the distribution of newspapers and books, the question
      dealt with in the last point of the Central Committee’s
      Instructions, point 7.

      The Council of People’s Commissars issued its decree on
      “The Centralisation of Libraries" (p. 439, Collection
      of Statutes, 1920, No. 87) on November 3, 1920, providing
      for the creation of a single network of libraries of the
      R.S.F.S.R.

      Here are some of the data I have been able to obtain on the
      question from Comrade Malkin of the Central Periodicals
      Administration, and from Comrade Modestov of the Library Section
      of the Moscow Department of Education. In 38 gubernias, 305
      uyezds, the number of libraries in central Soviet Russia
      (excluding Siberia and North Caucasus) was as follows:

Central libraries   342
District, urban libraries  521
Volost libraries   4,474
Travelling Volost libraries   1, 601
Village reading rooms  14 739
 Miscellaneous (“rural, juvinile, reference,
libraries of various institutions and organisations”) 12,203
Total 33,940


      Comrade Modestov believes, on the basis of his experience, that
      about three-quarters of this number actually exist, while the
      rest are only listed as such. For Moscow Gubernia, the Central
      Periodicals Administration gives the figure of 1,223 libraries,
      while Comrade Modestov’s figure is 1,018; of these 204 are
      in the city proper and 814 in the gubernia, net counting the
      trade union libraries (probably about 16) and the army libraries
      (about 125).

      As far as can be judged from a comparison of the different
      gubernias, these figures are not very reliable—let us hope
      the actual figure does net turn out to be under 75 per cent! In
      Vyalka Guhernia, for example, there are 1,703 village
      reading—rooms, in Vladimir Gubernia—37, in Petrograd
      Gubernia—98, in Ivanovo—Voznesensk
      Guhernia—75, etc. Of the ’miscellaneous" libraries
      there are 36 in Petrograd Gubernia, 378 in Voronezh Gubernia,
      525 in Ufa Gubernia, 31 in Pskov Gubernia, etc.

      These figures seem to show that the thirst for knowledge among
      the mass of workers and peasants is tremendous, and that the
      striving for education and the establishment of libraries is
      mighty and “popular” in the real sense of the
      word. But we are still very short of ability in organising,
      regulating, shaping and properly satisfying this popular
      urge. Much remains to be done in creating a real integrated
      network of libraries.

      How are we distributing the newspapers and books? According to
      the Administration’s 1020 figures for elovcii months, we
      distributed 401 million copies of newspapers and 14 million
      books. Here are the figures for three newspapers (January 12,
      1921), compiled by tho Periodicals Section of the Central Ad

      The figure for public reading stands, i.e., the really massive
      distribution, is astonishingly small, as against the enormous
      figures for the “establishments”, etc., in the
      capital, evidently the papers grabbed and bureaucratically
      utilised by “Soviet bureaucrats”, both military and
      civilian.

      Here are a few more figures taken from the reports of the local
      branches of the Central Periodicals Administration. In September
      1920, its Voronezh Gubernia branch received newspapers twelve
      times (that is to say, there were no papers on eighteen of the
      thirty days in September). Those received were distributed as
      follows: Izvestia (to 210rJ105 of the G.P.A.):
      uyezd—t,986 copies (4,020; 4,310)[First figure—Pravda, second,
      Bednota.]; uistnct—’i.215 (5,850; 10,064);
      voiost—3,370 (3,200; 4,285); Party organisations—447
      (569; 3,880); Soviet establish—ments—1,765 (1,641;
      509)—note that Soviet establishments received nearly three
      times as many copies of Pravda as Party organisations!
      Then follow: Agitation and Educa—tional Department of the
      Military Commissariat—5,532 (5,703; 12,83—2);
      agitation centres—352 (400; 593); village
      reading—rooms—nil. Subscribers—7,167 (3,080;
      764). Thus, “subscribers” (actually, of course,
      “Soviet bureaucrats") received a fat slice. Public reading
      stands—460 (508; 500). Total: 32,517 (25,104; 37,237).

      In November 1920, Ufa Gubernia received 25 consignments, that is
      to say, there was no delivery on five days only. Distribution:
      Party organ isations—1I3 (1,572; 153);

      Soviet establishments—2,7[53 (1,296; 1,267); 
      Agitation and Educational Department of the Military
      Commissariat—687 (470; 6,500); Volost Executive
      Committees—903 (308; 3,511); village
      reading—rooms——36 (Pravda—8, eight
      copies! —2,538); subscribers—nil; various uyezd
      organisations--1,044 (219; 991). Total: 5,841 (4,069; 15,429).

      Lastly, the report of the branch in Pustoshensk Volost, Sudogoda
      Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia for December 1920. Party
      organisations—1 (1; 2); Soviet offices—2 (1; 3);
      Agitation and Educational Department of the Military
      Commissariat—2 (1; 2); Volost Executive Committees—2
      (1; 3); post and telegraph offices—1 (1; 1); Urshelsky
      Works Committee—1 (1; 2); District Department of Social
      Main—tenance—1 (0; 3). Total: 10 (6; 16).

      What is the conclusion to he drawn from these fragmentary data?
      I believe it is what our Party Programme says, namely:
      ’Only the first steps in the transition from capitalism to
      communism are being taken ... at the present time.

      Under capitalism, a newspaper is a capitalist enterprise, a
      moans of enrichment, a medium of information and entertainment
      for the rich, and an instrument for duping and cheating the mass
      of working people. We have smashed this instrument of
      profit—making and deceit. We have begun to convert the
      newspapers into an instrument for educating the masses and for
      teaching them to live and run their economy without the
      landowners and capitalists. But we are only at the start of the
      road. Not much has been done during the last throe years or
      so. A great deal remains to he done: the road ahead is very long
      indeed. Let us have less political fireworks, fewer general
      arguments and abstract slogans from inexperienced Communists who
      fail to understand their tasks; let us have more production
      propaganda and, above all, more efficient and capable
      application of practical experience to fit the development of
      the masses.

      We have abolished newspaper subscriptions (I have no data on the
      distribution of books; there the situation is probably even
      worse). This is a step from capitalism to communism. But
      capitalism cannot be killed at one stroke; it rears its head in
      the form of ’Soviet bureaucrats” grabbing the
      newspapers on various pretexts—they must he grabbing a
      great number, though we cannot say just how many. There must be
      a sustained drive in this field against the Soviet bureaucrats,
      who must be “rapped over the knuckles” for grabbing
      books and newspapers. Their share—and they
      themselves—must be steadily reduced. Unfortunately, we are
      unable to slash their number down to one—tenth, or
      one—hundredth—it would be a fraud to promise this at
      our present level of culture, but we can and must whittle it
      down. No real Communist will fail to do this.

      We must see to it that books and newspapers are, as a rule,
      distributed gratis only to the libraries and
      reading—rooms, which provide a proper reading service for
      the whole country and the whole mass of workers, soldiers and
      peasants. This will accelerate, intensify and make more
      effective the people’s eager quest for knowledge. That is
      when education will advance by leaps and bounds.

      Here is some simple arithmetic by way of illustration: there are
      350,000 copies of Izvestia and 250,000 copies of Pravda for the
      whole of Russia. We are poor. We have no newsprint. The workers
      are short of fuel, food, clothes and footwear. The machines are
      worn out. The buildings are falling apart. Let us assume that we
      actually have for the country as a whole—that is some
      10,000 odd volosts—50,000 libraries and
      reading—rooms. This would give no less than three for each
      volost, and certainly one for each factory and military
      unit. Let us further assume that we have not only learned to
      take the first stop from capitalism to communism”, but
      also the second and the third. Let us assume that we have
      learned to distribute three copies of newspapers to every
      library and readingroom, of which, say, two go on the
      ’public reading stands” (assuming Uat we have taken
      the fourth stop from capitalism to communism, I make the bold
      assumption that instead of pasting newspapers on walls in the
      barbarous way which spoils them, we fix them with wooden
      pegs—we have no metal tacks, and there will be a shortage
      of metal even at the ’fourth step"!—to a smooth
      board for convenient reading and to keep the papers from
      spoiling). And so, two copies each for 50,000 libraries and
      reading—rooms for “pasting up” and one copy to
      be kept in reserve. Let us also assume that we have learned to
      allow the Soviet bureaucrats, the pampered
      “grandees” of the Soviet Republic, a
      moderate number of newspapers for them to waste, let us
      say, no more than a few thousand copies.

      On these bold assumptions the country will have a much better
      service with 160,000, or, say, 175,000 copies. The papers will
      be there for everyone to read the news (if the “travelling
      libraries” which, in my opinion, Comrade F. Dobler so
      successfully defended in Pravda just the other day, are
      properly organised[2]). All this needs is 350,000 copies
      of two newspapers. Today, there are 600,000 copies, a large part
      of which is being grabbed by the “Soviet
      bureaucrats”, wasted as “cigarette paper”,
      etc., simply through the habits acquired under capitalism. This
      would give us a saving of 250,000 copies, or, despite our
      extreme poverty, a saving equal to two dailies with a
      circulation of 125,000 each. Each of these could carry to the
      people every day serious and valuable literary material and the
      best modern and classical fiction, and textbooks on general
      educational subjects, agriculture and industry. Long before the
      war, the French bourgeoisie learned to make money by publishing
      popular fiction, not at 3.50 francs a volume for the gentry, but
      at 10 centimes (i.e., 35 times as cheap, 4 kopeks at the
      pre—war rate) in the form of a proletarian newspaper; why,
      in that case, can’t we do the same—at the second
      step from capitalism to communism. Why can’t we do the
      same thing and ]earn, within a year, even in our present state
      of poverty, to give the people two copies of a newspaper through
      each of the 50,000 libraries and reading-rooms, all the
      necessary textbooks and world classics, and books on modern
      science and engineering.

      We shall learn to do this, I am sure.

1. Satisfy the wish of the non-Party peasants for the substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system (the confiscation of surplus grain stocks).
2. Reduce the size of this tax as compared with last year’s appropriation rate. 
3. Approve the principle of making the tax commensurate with the farmer’s effort, reducing the rate for those making the greater effort.
 4. Give the farmer more leeway in using his after-tax surpluses in local trade, provided his tax is promptly paid up in full.

[1]  Lenin wrote a rough draft of the theses on February 8, 1921, at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party’s C.C., which dealt with the problems of the spring sowing campaign and the condition of the peasants. It was the first document defining the new economic foundation of the workers’ and peasants’ alliance, charting the transition from War Communism to the New Economic Policy. It was taken as a basis for the draft resolution on the substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system, which was adopted by the Tenth Party Congress on March 15, 1921.

 To Members of the Political Bureau

      
      and Comrade Rykov,

      
      Stalin,

      
      Bukharin,

      
      Kamenev,

      
      Krestinsky,

      
      Rykov
    

      We are in receipt of replies to the Political Bureau’s
      query concerning oil concessions both from Krasin (and
      Bogdatyan) and Chairman of Glavneft[Chief
      Oil Industry Administration.—Translator]
      Dosser and his four experts.

      In connection with the report, The State of the Oil Industry
      by the End of 1920 (Baku, 1920), I am sending these replies
      on to Comrade Stalin, and request all members of the Political
      Bureau to ring him up to obtain all this materia] and read it in
      good time. (All you have to do with regard to the printed report
      is to read through what I have marked off with a blue pencil on
      the pages listed on the cover, that is, on the page before the
      text.)

      This material needs to be read urgently, because it is desirable
      to have a Political Bureau decision (8.00 p.m . Monday, February
      14).

      The material gives ample proof that:

      (a) disaster is imminent ;

      (b) everything must be done to lease out the concessions in Baku
      (that is, find the concessionaires);

      (c) the Glavneft Chairman is extremely stupid. Stupidity in such
      high quarters is a menace.

      These three points summed up:

      (a) Disaster is looming. This point is driven home by the
      Glavneft experts. The fool Dosser tries to
      minimise the danger in his “memo”. That is
      the height of stupidity. The opinions of all the Glavneft
      experts should be read and compared with Dosser’s
      toned-down conclusion.

      (b) Dosser formulates his conclusion as follows: “There is
      doubtful benefit in inviting a concessionaire.” It looks
      as though he has, like the truly well-intentioned fool that he
      is, scared his experts into believing that an anti-concession
      stand is the only decent one to take for a “Soviet”
      citizen. That’s a really “good turn” he has
      done us!

      In the practical plane, the reports of the Glavneft experts
      (which are business-like and are strictly borne out by the
      “end of 1920” printed report) clarify the kind
      of terms we should lay down for the concessionaire.

      It is, of course, “doubtful” whether a
      concessionaire can be found on these terms. But no politician in
      his right mind would consult Dosser or the experts on that.

      It is up to us to make every effort to find such
      concessionaires.

      If we don’t, so much the worse for us.

      If we fail to make an all-out effort to find a concessionaire,
      we shall find ourselves bankrupt.

      The working out of the terms must be speeded up.

      An immediate start must be made in fighting a highly dangerous
      prejudice which could easily carry a section of the workers and
      which must be debunked at any cost. It is this
      “idea”: “We don’t want to work for the
      capitalists”, or its variant, “We don’t want
      to work for the capitalists when workers nearby are not doing
      it”.

      The harm of it (refuted by the R.C.P. Programme and Marxism in
      general) is evident from this rough calculation, which
      epitomises the conclusion given in the experts’
      reports.

      We are extracting 100a of oil.

      Output is dropping.

      Flooding threatens disaster.

      If we get a concessionaire, who will help to extract
      100a + 100b of oil, and if we have to pay him
      98b for this, our output will rise, instead of
      dropping, even if ever so slowly (100a + 2b
      ). 

      Here is the question: are the workers who give the
      concessionaire 98b out of the 100b working for
      “the capitalists” or for the Soviet power?

      There is no difficulty about the answer.

      Please go over the enclosed material and reports urgently, to
      allow us to take a decision as soon as possible. There is
      extreme danger in any delay.

Integrated Economic Plan


Delivered:  21 February , 1921 
First Published: Pravda No. 39, February 22, 1921; Signed: N. Lenin; Published according to the Pravda text collated with the proofs containing Lenin’s corrections

      What is being said and written on this subject leaves a very
      painful impression. Take L. Kritsman’s articles in
      Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn [1] (I—December
      14, 1920; II—December 23; III—February 9;
      IV—February 16; and V—February 20). There is nothing
      there but empty talk and word-spinning, a refusal to consider
      and look into what has been done in this field. Five long
      articles of reflection on how to approach the study of facts and
      data, instead of any actual examination of them.

      Take Milyutin ’s theses (Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn,
      February 19), or Larin’s (ibid., February 20); listen to
      the speeches of “responsible” comrades: they all
      have the same basic defects as Kritsman’s articles. They
      all reveal the dullest sort of scholasticism, including a lot of
      twaddle about the law of concatenation, etc. It is a
      scholasticism that ranges from the literary to the bureaucratic,
      to the exclusion of all practical effort.

      But what is even worse is the highbrow bureaucratic disdain for
      the vital work that has been done and that needs to be
      continued. Again and again there is the emptiest “drawing
      up of theses” and a concoction of plans and slogans, in
      place of painstaking and thoughtful study of our own practical
      experience.

      The only serious work on the subject is the Plan for the
      Electrification of the R.S.F.S.R., the report of GOELRO
      (the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia) to the
      Eighth Congress of Soviets, published in December 1920 and
      distributed at the Congress. It outlines an integrated economic
      plan which has been worked out—only as a rough
      approximation, of course—by the best brains in  the
      Republic on the instructions of its highest bodies. We have to
      make a very modest start in fighting the complacency born of the
      ignorance of the grandees, and the intellectualist conceit of
      the Communist literati, by telling the story of this book, and
      describing its content and significance .   

    

      More than a year
      ago—February 2-7, 1920—the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee met in session and adopted a resolution on
      electrification which says: 

      “ Along with the most immediate, vital and urgent tasks in
      organising transport, coping with the fuel and food crises,
      fighting epidemics, and forming disciplined labour armies,
      Soviet Russia now has, for the first time, an opportunity of
      starting on more balanced economic development, and working out
      a nation-wide state economic plan on scientific lines and
      consistently implementing it. In view of the prime importance of
      electrification . . . mindful of the importance of
      electrification for industry, agriculture and transport,
      . . . and so on and so forth . . . , the Committee resolves: to
      authorise the Supreme Economic Council to work out, in
      conjunction with the People’s Commissariat for
      Agriculture, a project for the construction of a system of
      electric power stations. . . .”

      This seems to be clear enough, doesn’t it? “A
      nationwide state economic plan on scientific lines": is it
      possible to misread these words in the decision adopted by our
      highest authority? If the literati and the grandees, who boast
      of their communism before the “experts”, are
      ignorant of this decision it remains for us to remind them that
      ignorance of our laws is no argument.

      In pursuance of the All-Russia C.E.C. resolution, the Presidium
      of the Supreme Economic Council, on February 21, 1920, confirmed
      the Electrification Commission set up under the Electricity
      Department, after which the Council of Defence endorsed the
      statute on GOELRO, whose composition the Supreme Economic
      Council was instructed to determine and confirm by agreement
      with the People ’s Commissariat for Agriculture. On April
      24, 1920, GOELRO issued its Bulletin No. 1,[2]
      containing a detailed programme of works and a list of the
      responsible persons, scientists, engineers, agronomists and
      statisticians on the several subcommissions to direct operations
      in the various areas, together with the specific assignments
      each had undertaken. The list of persons and their assignments
      runs  to ten printed pages of Bulletin No. 1. The best
      talent available to the Supreme Economic Council, the
      People’s Commissariat for Agriculture and the
      People’s Commissariat for Communications has been
      recruited.

      The GOELRO effort has produced this voluminous—and
      first-class—scientific publication. Over 180 specialists
      worked on it. There are more than 200 items on the list of works
      they have submitted to GOELRO. We find, first, a summary of
      these works (the first part of the volume, running to over 200
      pages): a) electrification and a state economic plan; followed
      by b) fuel supply (with a detailed “fuel budget” for
      the R.S.F.S.R. over the next ten years, with an
      estimate of the manpower required); c) water power; d)
      agriculture; e) transport; and f) industry.

      The plan ranges over about ten years and gives an indication of
      the number of workers and capacities (in 1,000 hp). Of course,
      it is only a rough draft, with possible errors, and a
      “rough approximation”, but it is a real scientific
      plan. We have precise calculations by experts for every major
      item, and every industry. To give a small example, we have their
      calculations for the output of leather, foot wear at two pairs a
      head (300 million pairs), etc. As a result, we have a material
      and a financial (gold rubles) balance sheet for electrification
      (about 370 million working days, so many barrels of cement, so
      many bricks, poods of iron, copper, and other things; turbine
      generator capacities, etc.). It envisages (“at a very
      rough estimate”) an 80 per cent increase in manufacturing,
      and 80-100 per cent, in extracting industry over the next ten
      years. The gold balance deficit (+ 11,000 million - 17,000
      million leaves a total deficit of about 6,000 million)
      “can be covered by means of concessions and credit
      operations".

      It gives the site of the first 20 steam and 10 water power
      district electric stations, and a detailed description of the
      economic importance of each.

      The general summary is followed, in the same volume, by a list
      of works for each area (with a separate paging): Northern,
      Central Industrial (both of which are especially well set out in
      precise detail based on a wealth of scientific data), Southern,
      Volga, Urals? Caucasian (the Caucasus is taken as a whole in
      anticipation of an economic agreement between its various
      republics), Western Siberia and Turkestan. For each of the
      areas, electric power capacities are projected beyond the first
      limits; this is followed by the “GOELRO Programme
      A”, that is, the plan for the use of existing
      electric power stations on the most rational and economic
      lines. Here is another small example: it is estimated that a
      grid of the Petrograd stations (Northern Area) could yield the
      following economy (p. 69): up to one-half of the capacities
      could be diverted to the logging areas of the North, such as
      Murmansk and Archangel, etc. The resulting increase in the
      output and export of timber could yield “up to 500
      million rubles’ worth of foreign exchange a year in the
      immediate period ahead”.

      “ Annual receipts from the sale of our northern timber
      could very well equal our gold reserves over the next few
      years” (ibid., p. 70), provided, of course, we stop
      talking about plans and start studying and applying the
      plan already worked out by our scientists.

      Let me add that we have an embryonic calendar programme for a
      number of other items (though not for all, of course). This is
      more than a general plan: it is an estimate for each year, from
      1921 to 1930, of the number of stations that can be run in, and
      the proportions to which the existing ones can be enlarged,
      provided again we start doing what I have just said, which is
      not easy in view of the ways of our intellectualist literati and
      bureaucratic grandees. 

    

         
      A look at Germany will bring out the dimensions and value of
      GOELRO’s effort. Over there, the scientist Ballod produced
      a similar work: he compiled a scientific plan for the socialist
      reconstruction of the whole national economy of Germany.[3] But his being a capitalist country,
      the plan never got off the ground. It remains a lone-wolf
      effort, and an exercise in literary composition. With us over
      here it was a state assignment, mobilising hundreds of
      specialists and producing an integrated economic plan on
      scientific lines within 10 months (and not two, of course, as we
      had originally planned). We have every right to be proud of this
      work, and it remains for us to understand how it should
      be used. What we now have to contend with is failure to
      understand this fact.

      The resolution of the Eighth Congress of Soviets says:
      “The Congress . . . approves the work of the Supreme
      Economic Council, etc., especially that of GOELRO in
      drawing up the plan for the electrification of Russia
      . . . regards this plan as the first step in a great
      economic endeavour, authorises the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee, etc., to put the finishing touches to
      the plan and to endorse it, at the very earliest
      date. . . . It authorises the adoption of all measures for the
      most extensive popularisation of this plan. . . . A
      study of this plan must be an item in the curricula of all
      educational establishments of the Republic, without
      exception”,[4] etc.

      The bureaucratic and intellectualist defects of our apparatus,
      especially of its top drawer, are most glaringly revealed by the
      attitude to this resolution taken by some people in Moscow and
      their efforts to twist it, to the extent of ignoring it
      altogether. Instead of advertising the plan, the literati
      produce theses and empty disquisitions on how to start working
      out a plan. The grandees, in purely bureaucratic fashion, lay
      stress on the need to “approve” the plan, by which
      they do not mean concrete assignments (the dates for the
      construction of the various installations, the purchase of
      various items abroad, etc.) but some muddled idea, such as
      working out a new plan. The misunderstanding this
      produces is monstrous, and there is talk of partially restoring
      the old before getting on with the new. Electrification, it is
      said, is something of an “electrofiction". Why not
      gasification, we are asked; GOELRO, they also say, is full of
      bourgeois specialists, with only a handful of Communists; GOELRO
      should provide the cadre of experts, instead of staffing the
      general planning commission, and so forth.

      The danger lies in this discord, for it betrays an inability to
      work, and the prevalence of intellectualist and bureaucratic
      complacency, to the exclusion of all real effort. The conceited
      ignoramus is betrayed by his jibes at the
      “fantastic” plan, his questions about gasification,
      etc. The nerve of their trying, offhand, to pick holes in
      something it took an army of first-class specialists to produce!
      Isn’t it a shame to try to shrug it off with trite little
      jokes, and to put on airs about one’s right “to
      withhold approval"?

      It is time we learned to put a value on science and got  rid of
      the “communist” conceit of the dabbler and the
      bureaucrat; it is time we learned to work systematically, making
      use of our own experience and practice.

      Of course, “plans” naturally give rise to endless
      argument and discussion, but when the task is to get down to the
      study of the only scientific plan before us, we should not allow
      ourselves to engage in general statements and debates about
      underlying “principles". We should get down to correcting
      it on the strength of practical experience and a more
      detailed study. Of course, the grandees always retain the right
      to “give or withhold approval". A sober view of this
      right, and a reasonable reading of the resolution of the Eighth
      Congress concerning the approval of the plan, which it endorsed
      and handed down to us for the broadest popularisation, show that
      approval must be taken to mean the placing of a series of orders
      and the issue of a set of instructions, such as the items to be
      purchased, the building to be started, the materials to be
      collected and forwarded, etc. Upon the other hand,
      “approval” from the bureaucratic standpoint means
      arbitrary acts on the part of the grandees, the red-tape
      runaround, the commissions-of-inquiry game, and the strictly
      bureaucratic foul-up of anything that is going.

      Let us look at the matter from yet another angle. There is a
      special need to tie in the scientific plan for electrification
      with existing short-term plans and their actual
      implementation. That this must be done is naturally beyond
      doubt. But how is it to be done? To find out, the economists,
      the literati, and the statisticians should stop their twaddle
      about the plan in general, and get on with a detailed study of
      the implementation of our plans, our mistakes in this practical
      business, and ways of correcting them. Otherwise we shall have
      to grope our way long. Over and above such a study of our
      practical experience, there remains the very small matter of
      administrative technique. Of planning commissions we have more
      than enough. Take two men from the department under Ivan
      Ivanovich and integrate them with one from the department under
      Pavel Pavlovich, or vice versa. Link them up with a
      subcommission of the general planning commission. All of which
      boils down to administrative technique. Various combinations
      should be tried out, and the best selected. That is
      elementary.

      The whole point is that we have yet to learn the art of
      approach, and stop substituting intellectualist and bureaucratic
      projecteering for vibrant effort. We have, and have had,
      short-term food and fuel plans, and there are glaring mistakes
      in both. That is unquestionable. But the efficient economist,
      instead of penning empty theses, will get down to a study of the
      facts and figures, and analyse our own practical experience. He
      will pin-point the mistakes and suggest a remedy. This kind of
      study will suggest to the efficient administrator the transfers,
      alterations of records, recasting of the machinery, etc., to be
      proposed or put through. You don’t find us doing anything
      of the sort.

      The main flaw is in the wrong approach to the relationships
      between the Communists and the specialists, the administrators
      and the scientists and writers. There is no doubt at all that
      some aspects of the integrated economic plan, as of any other
      undertaking, call for the administrative approach or for
      decisions by Communists alone. Let me add that new aspects of
      that kind can always come to the fore. That, however, is the
      purely abstract way of looking at it. Right now, our communist
      writers and administrators are taking quite the wrong approach,
      because they have failed to realise that in this case we should
      be learning all we can from the bourgeois specialists and
      scientists, and cutting out the administrative
      game. GOELRO’s is the only integrated economic plan we can
      hope to have just now. It should be amplified, elaborated,
      corrected and applied in the light of well scrutinised practical
      experience. The opposite view boils down to the purely
      “pseudo-radical conceit, which in actual fact is nothing
      but ignorance”, as our Party Programme puts it.[5] Ignorance and conceit are equally
      betrayed by the view that we can have another general planning
      commission in the R.S.F.S.R. in addition to GOELRO, which, of
      course, is not to deny that some advantage may be gained from
      partial and business-like changes in its membership. It is only
      on this basis—by continuing what has been
      started—that we can hope to make any serious improvements
      in the general economic  plan; any other course will involve us
      in an administrative game, or high-handed action, to put it
      bluntly. The task of the Communists inside GOELRO is to issue
      fewer orders, rather, to refrain from issuing any at all, and to
      be very tactful in their dealings with the scientists and
      technicians (the R.C.P. Programme says: “Most of them
      inevitably have strong bourgeois habits and take the bourgeois
      view of things”). The task is to learn from them and to
      help them to broaden their world-view on the basis of
      achievements in their particular field, always bearing in mind
      that the engineer’s way to communism is different
      from that of the underground propagandist and the writer; he is
      guided along by the evidence of his own science, so
      that the agronomist, the forestry expert, etc., each have their
      own path to tread towards communism. The Communist who has
      failed to prove his ability to bring together and guide the work
      of specialists in a spirit of modesty, going to the heart of the
      matter and studying it in detail, is a potential menace. We have
      many such Communists among us, and I would gladly swap dozens of
      them for one conscientious qualified bourgeois specialist.

      There are two ways in which Communists outside GOELRO can help
      to establish and implement the integrated economic plan. Those
      of them who are economists, statisticians or writers should
      start by making a study of our own practical experience, and
      suggest corrections and improvements only after such a detailed
      study of the facts. Research is the business of the scientist,
      and once again, because we are no longer dealing with general
      principles, but with practical experience, we find that we can
      obtain much more benefit from a “specialist in science and
      technology”, even if a bourgeois one, than from the
      conceited Communist who is prepared, at a moment’s notice,
      to write “theses”, issue “slogans” and
      produce meaningless abstractions. What we need is more factual
      knowledge and fewer debates on ostensible communist
      principles.

      Upon the other hand, the Communist administrator’s prime
      duty is to see that he is not carried away by the issuing of
      orders. He must learn to start by looking at the achievements of
      science, insisting on a verification of the facts, and locating
      and studying the mistakes (through reports, articles in the
      press, meetings, etc.), before proceeding with any
      corrections. We need more practical studies of our mistakes, in
      place of the Tit Titych[6] type of tactics
      (“I might give my approval, if I feel like it”).

      Men’s vices, it has long been known, are for the most part
      bound up with their virtues. This, in fact, applies to many
      leading Communists. For decades, we had been working for the
      great cause, preaching the overthrow of the bourgeoisie,
      teaching men to mistrust the bourgeois specialists, to expose
      them, deprive them of power and crush their resistance. That is
      a historic cause of world-wide significance. But it needs only a
      slight exaggeration to prove the old adage that there is only
      one step from the sublime to the ridiculous. Now that we have
      convinced Russia, now that we have wrested Russia from the
      exploiters and given her to the working people, now that we have
      crushed the exploiters, we must learn to run the country. This
      calls for modesty and respect for the efficient
      “specialists in science and technology”, and a
      business-like and careful analysis of our numerous practical
      mistakes, and their gradual but steady correction. Let us have
      less of this intellectualist and bureaucratic complacency, and a
      deeper scrutiny of the practical experience being gained in the
      centre and in the localities, and of the available achievements
      of science.

Comrades, I send my heartfelt greetings to the Fifth
      All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets. I am sure that the alliance between the
      poor peasants and Ukrainian workers will strengthen Soviet Ukraine and
      consolidate the Ukrainian Republic, despite the enemy’s traps and
      machinations.
I have asked Comrade Petrovsky to convey my regret at being unable to
      accept your invitation to attend the Congress. Nevertheless, I hope to be
      able to visit Soviet Ukraine in the near future. I wish the Congress
      success in consolidating the power of the workers and peasants and in
      restoring the national economy.
Yours, Lenin

(Prolonged applause.) Before going on to the
domestic situation—a subject which, quite naturally, arouses great
interest and much concern—let me run over the salient international
developments. To be brief, I shall deal with only three. The first is our
conference with Turkish delegates which has opened here in Moscow.[2] This
is an especially welcome fact, because there had been many obstacles to
direct negotiations with the Turkish Government delegation, and now that
there is an opportunity of reaching an understanding here in Moscow, we
feel sure that a firm foundation will be laid for closer relations and
friendship. Of course, this will not be achieved through diplomatic
machinations (in which, we are not afraid to admit, our adversaries have
the edge on us), but through the fact that over the past few years both
nations have had to endure untold suffering at the hands of the
imperialist powers. A previous speaker referred to the harm of isolation
from the imperialist countries. But when a wolf attacks a sheep, there is
hardly any point in advising the sheep to avoid isolation from the wolf.
(Laughter, applause.) Up to now, the Eastern peoples may have
been like sheep before the imperialist wolf, but Soviet Russia was the
first to show that, despite her unparalleled military weakness, it is not
so easy for the wolf to get his claws and teeth into her. This example has
proved to be catching for many nations, regardless of whether or not they
sympathise with the “Bolshevik rumour-mongers.” We are a popular
topic all over the world, and, in relation to Turkey, have even been
‘described as malicious rumour-mongers. Of course, we have so far
been unable to do anything in this sphere, but the Turkish workers and
peasants have demonstrated that the resistance on the part of modern
nations to plunder is a thing that has to be reckoned with: Turkey herself
resisted plunder by the imperialist governments with such vigour that even
the strongest of them have had to keep their hands off her. That is what
makes us regard the current negotiations with the Turkish Government as a
very great achievement. We have no hidden motives. We know that these
negotiations will proceed within a very modest framework, but they are
important because the workers and peasants of all countries are drawing
steadily closer together, despite all the formidable obstructions. This is
something we should bear in mind when assessing our present
difficulties.
The second thing worth recalling in connection with the international
situation is the state of the peace talks in Riga.[3] You know that in
order to conclude a peace with any degree of stability we have been making
the greatest possible concessions to all the states formerly within the
Russian Empire. This is very natural because national oppression is one of
the main factors which arouses hatred for the imperialists and unites the
peoples against them, and few states in the world have sinned as much in
this respect as the old Russian Empire and the bourgeois republic of
Kerensky, the Meusheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in alliance with
the bourgeoisie. That is why it is in respect of these nations that we
have shown the greatest willingness to make concessions and readiness to
accept such peace terms, for which some Socialist-Revolutionaries have
virtually called us Tolstoyans. We don’t care, because we have to
show the greatest willingness to compromise with these nations, to dispel
the age-old suspicions generated by the old oppression, and to lay the
foundation for a union of workers and peasants of various nations which
once suffered together at the hands of tsarism and the Russian landowners,
and now suffer at the hands of imperialism. In respect of Poland, this
policy has been largely frustrated by the Russian whiteguards,
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who enjoy “freedom of the
press", “freedom of speech” and other wonderful ‘freedoms
’, alongside the extraordinary freedom of the French and other
capitalists to buy up a larger part of Poland, where they are at liberty
to spread their propaganda in an effort to push Poland into a war against
us. The capitalists are now doing their utmost to disrupt the peace that
has been concluded. One of the reasons why we cannot demobilise our army,
as we should like to do, is that we must reckon with the possibility of
war on a much larger scale than some people imagine. Those who say that we
need not put so much into defence are wrong, because our enemies are
resorting to all sorts of machinations and intrigues to break up the final
peace with Poland, the provisional terms of which have already been
signed. These negotiations have lately been dragging on, and although a
few weeks ago things had come to such a pass that there was reason to fear
a serious crisis, we recently decided to make some further concessions,
not because we thought they were warranted, but because we considered it
necessary to thwart the intrigues of the Russian whiteguards,
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in Warsaw, and of the Entente
imperialists, who are making the greatest efforts to prevent peace. It has
not yet been signed, but let me say that we have every reason to be
optimistic: it will be signed in the near future, and we shall succeed In
thwarting the intrigues against Its conclusion. Although this is only
guesswork on my part, I believe tile prospect will gladden us all. But let
us not count our chickens before they are hatched. That is why we shall
not slacken or weaken our military effort however slightly, but we shall
not be afraid to make a few more concessions to bourgeois Poland, so as to
wrest the workers and peasants of Poland from the Entente and prove to
them that the workers’ and peasants’ government does not deal
in national strife. We shall defend this peace even at the price of
considerable sacrifice.
The third international question is the events in the Caucasus. There
have been large-scale developments there recently, and although we do not
yet know the details their implication is that we are on the brink of a
major war. We were, of course, disturbed at the clash between Armenia and
Georgia, for these events turned the Armenian-Georgian war into an
insurrection, with a section of the Russian troops taking part. The upshot
of all this was that, for the time being, the tables have been turned on
the Armenian bourgeoisie, which had been scheming against us, so that,
according to the latest but still unconfirmed reports, Soviet power has
been established in Tiflis. (Applause.) We know that the insurrection
began in the neutral zone of Armenia, which lies between Georgia and
Armenia, and winch Georgia had occupied with the consent of the Entente
imperialists. When the Mensheviks, particularly the Georgian Mensheviks,
speak of the harm of isolation from the Western powers, they usually mean
the reliance on the Entente imperialists, who are stronger than anyone
else. But some whitoguards tend to forget that the advanced capitalists
are more deceitful than anyone else, and say to themselves: can Armenia,
the Armenian peasants, etc., or the ravaged Soviet Republic be compared to
the united imperialist powers of the world? Let us turn to the advanced
capitalists for they are the civilised forces of the world. That is how
the Georgian Mensheviks seek to justify their unseemly defence of the
capitalists, and they had control of the only railway line, the Armenian
peasants’ food supply line.
No one will have the patience to read all the telegrams, statements and
protests we exchanged with Georgia on this question. If we had had a peace
treaty with Georgia, our policy would have been to procrastinate as long
as possible. You must understand, however, that the Armenian peasants did
not view the treaty question in that light, and things culminated in the
terrible insurrection which broke out in early February and spread with
astonishing rapidity, involving not only Armenians, but also Georgians.
There has been hardly any news from over there, but our assumptions have
been borne out by the latest available report. We know perfectly well that
the Georgian bourgeoisie and the Georgian Mensboviks do not rely for
support on their working people, but on their capitalists, who are only
looking for a pretext to start hostilities. Upon the other hand, we have
had our stake on the working people for three years and we shall continue
to have it on them to the last even in this backward and oppressed
country.

      With all our circumspection and all our efforts to strengthen the Red
      Army, we shall ultimately do everything possible to put out the flames in
      the Caucasus. We shall demonstrate in the East what we have been able to
      demonstrate in the West: when Soviet power is in, national oppression is
      out. On this, in the final analysis, depends the outcome of the struggle,
      and because of their superior numbers the workers and peasants will
      ultimately prove to he stronger than the capitalists.
Let me now turn from foreign policy to home affairs. I have been
unable, unfortunately, to hear the whole of Comrade Bryiikhanov’s
report. He has given you the facts in detail and I need not go over that
again. I want to deal with the main thing, which may possibly show us the
causes of our terrible crisis. We shall have to set ourselves a task and
find a way to solve it. There is a path, we have found it, but we are not
yet strong enough to follow it with the persistence and the regularity
demanded by the difficult post-war conditions. We are in every respect
poverty-stricken, and yet we are no more destitute than the workers of
Vienna. They and their children are starving and dying, but they have not
the main thing that w have: they have no hope. They are dying, crushed by
capitalism; they are in a position where they have to endure sacrifices,
but net as we do. We make sacrifices for the war which we have declared on
the whole capitalist world. That is the difference between the position
of the workers of Petrograd and Moscow and that of the workers of Vienna.
Now, in the spring, our hardships due to the food shortage have once again
become more acute, after the improvement earlier on. The fact is that we
had miscalculated. When the plan for surplus-food appropriation was drawn
up, we thought we could improve on our success. The people had gone hungry
for so long that their condition had to he improved at all costs. It was
essential not only to help, but to improve things. We had failed to see
that if we improved things then, we shoould be hard pressed later on,
and it was due to this mistake that we now face a food crisis. We have
made the same mistake elsewhere: in the Polish war, and in fuel. The
procurement of food and fuel—coal, oil, fire-wood—are all
different types of work, but in all three we have made identical mistakes.
At the time of the severest hardships, we overestimated our resources and
failed to take stock of them properly. We failed to realise that we were
using up our resources all at once, we failed to estimate our reserves,
and we put nothing by for a rainy day. This is, generally speaking, a good
rule of thumb that any peasant follows in his simple, everyday economy.
But there we were, acting on a nation-wide scale as if we gave no thought
to the reserves so long as we had enough for today, so that when we were
finally faced with and brought up short by this question of reserves we
were quite unable to put anything by for a rainy day.
During the Polish war we had a vigorous, daring Red Army, but we
advanced too far—to the very gates of Warsaw, and then had to roll
back, almost to Minsk. The same thing has happened with the food supply.
True enough, we emerged from the war as victors. In 1920, we offered the
Polish landowners and bourgeoisie peace on terms more advantageous to them
than the present terms. They were taught a lesson, and the whole world was
taught a lesson, which nobody had previously bargained for. When we speak
about our position we tell the truth; if anything, we tend to exaggerate
the negative side. In April 1920, we said: transport is falling to pieces,
there is no food. We said this frankly in our newspapers and spoke about
it openly at mass meetings in the best halls of Moscow and Petrograd. The
spies of Europe rushed to cable the news, and over there some people
rubbed their hands in glee and said: ”Get on with the job, you Poles:
you see how badly things are going with them, we shall soon crush
them.” But we were telling the truth, sometimes tending to
exaggerate the negative side. Let the workers and peasants know that our
difficulties are not over. And when the Polish army, with French, British
and other military advisers and arms and money, went into battle, it was
defeated. And now, when we say that our affairs are in poor shape, when
      our ambassadors report that the whole of the bourgeois press is
saying “The Soviet power is doomed", when even Chernov
has said that it will

undoubtedly fall, we say: “You can shout your heads off, that’s
what freedom of the press on capitalist money is for, you have as much of
this freedom as you want, but we are still not in the least afraid to
speak the bitter truth.” Indeed, the situation this spring has
worsened again, and our papers are full of admissions of this bad
situation. But we say to the foreign capitalists, the Mensheviks, the
S.R.s, the Savinkovites,[4] or whatever else they are called: just you try
to cash in on this and you will find yourselves in a far deeper hole.
(Applause.) It is obviously a difficult transition from our state of utter
destitution in 1918-19, when it was very hard to think about a
year’s reserve or allocation, and when all we could do was to look
one or two weeks ahead and say ‘we’ll see” about the
third one. It is obviously difficult to change over from this situation to
that of 1920, when we saw that our army was bigger than that of the Poles,
when we had twice as much grain as the previous year, when we had fuel,
and when there was one and a half times more Donets and Siberian coal. We
were unable to distribute this on a nation-wide scale. You must remember
that annual estimates require a special approach and special conditions.
We knew that the spring would be worse than the autumn, but how much
worse, we could not know. It is not a matter of figures or distribution
but a matter of the degree to which the workers and peasants have starved,
and the extent of the sacrifice they are still able to make for the common
cause of all workers and peasants. Who can estimate this? Some may point
out this error—it is an error, and we make no effort to conceal the
fact, just as we did net conceal it in the case of the Polish war
—but leil those who blam us for it—and justly so—giver us 
as estimate for projecting the national amount to be set aside from the 
first six months’ grain reserves, so as to leave something in stock 
for the six months after that. No such estimates have been made. We first
tried to work out some in 1920 and miscalculated. In certain respects, a
revolution is a miracle. If we had been told in 1917 that we would hold
out in three years of war against the whole world, that, as a result of
the war, two million Russian landowners, capitalists and their children
would find themselves abroad, and that we would turn out to be the
victors, no one of us would have believed it. A miracle took place because
the workers and peasants rose against the attack of the landowners and
capitalists in such force that even powerful capitalism was in danger. But
just because of the miracle we lost the habit of taking the long view of
things. That is why all of us now have to limp along. The forthcoming
Party Congress is to be called earlier, because we need to sum up this new
experience in earnest. The defence of the workers’ and
peasants’ power was achieved by a miracle, not a divine
miracle—it was not something that fell from the skies-hut a miracle
in the sense that, no matter how oppressed, humiliated, ruined and
exhausted the workers and peasants were, precisely because the revolution
went along with the workers, it mustered very much more strength than any
rich, enlightened and advanced state could have mustered. But this will
not work in economics, where-perhaps the word is not altogether
appropriate—you need “thrift.” We have not yet learned
to practise “thrift” . We must hear in mind that we have 
defeated the bourgeoi-sie, but that
they are still with its and so the struggle goes on. And spreading panic
is one of their ways of lighting us. We must net forget that they are past
masters at it. They have their newspapers, although net printed ones, but
splendidly distributed, and they are doing much more than making mountains
out of molehills. But under no circumstances must we succumb to panic.
The situation has been aggravated because we have made mistakes in every
field of work. Let us not be afraid of these mistakes, let us not be
afraid to admit them; let us not indulge in mutual recrim-ination; but if
we are to make use of all our resources and put in the greatest effort in
every field, we must know how to reckon. Reckoning will give us control of
the whole Republic, for proper reckoning alone will give us an estimate of
the large amounts of available grain and fuel. The bread ration will be
short for a lusty appetite, but the amount cannot he increased all at
once. There will he a shortage only if we do not lay in stocks, but we
shall have enough if we make a correct estimate and give to the most
needy, and take from those who have large surpluses rather than from those
who, over the last three years, may have given away their last crust. Hive
the peasants of the Ukraine and Siberia seen the point of this reckoning?
Not yet, I’m afraid. Their present and past grain surpluses have
never been matched in central Russia, nor have they ever experienced such
a plight. The peasants of the Ukraine, Siberia and Northern Caucasus have
never known such destitution and hunger as the peasants of Moscow and
Petro-grad guhernias (who received far less than the Ukrainian peasants)
have endured for three years. Their surpluses usually ran to hundreds of
poods, and they were accustomed to receive goods at once for that kind of
surplus. There is nowhere to obtain the goods from, now that the factories
are at a standstill. To set them going once again will take time and
preparation, and workers. Our tremendous sacrifices are not made in a
state of desperation, but in a fight that wins one victory after another.
This is a distinction that makes all the difference.
That is the main point that I wished to make here, not in terms of the
exact figures given by the comrade responsible for food supplies and by
the comrade responsible for fuel, but in terms of economics and politics,
to help understand how our recent mistakes differ from earlier ones, and
while they are different they still have this in common, that we have
tried to jump two rungs when we only had the possibility of climbing one.
Nevertheless, we are now at a higher stage. That is good. This year we
shall have a much better fuel balance than last year. And let me give you
one final fact in regard to the food supply: the Deputy Commander-in-Chief
of the republican forces in Siberia has cabled that communications have
been restored and that seven train-loads of grain are on their way to
Moscow. At one time there were disturbances and kulak revolts. Of course,
it is possible to joke about rumour-mongers, but it is necessary to
appreciate that after all we have learned a thing or two in the course of
the class struggle. We know that the tsarist government called us
rumour-mongers, hut when we speak of the Socialist-Revolutionary and
Menshevik rumour-mongers, we are speaking of another class, of people who
support the bourgeoisie and who take advantage of every difficulty to
issue leaflets and say: ‘Look, 300 poods of grain surpluses are
being confiscated from you; you give everything away, and get nothing in
return but coloured bits of paper.” Don’t we know these
rumour-mongers! What is their class? No matter what they call themselves,
Socialist-Revolutionaries, lovers of liberty, of peoples power,
constituent assemblies, and so on, they are the same old landowners. We
have heard all they have to say and have learned to understand their true
meaning. These revolts indicate that there are people among the peasants
who do not wish to reconcile themselves either to surplus food
requisitioning or to the tax. Someone here has mentioned the tax. Much of
what he said was common sense, but he should have added that before we
said anything about it from this platform, the newspaper Pravda, which is
the Central Organ of the Russian Communist Party, carried tax proposals
signed not only by casual contributors but by staff correspondents.[5] When
the non-Party peasant says to us: “Make your calculations conform to
the needs of the small peasant; he needs confidence; I shall give so much
and then I shall look to my own affairs,” we say: “Yes, that is
business-like, that is common sense and is in keeping with local
conditions.” So long as we have no machines, so long as the peasant
himself has no wish to change over from small-scale to large-scale
farming, we are inclined to take this idea into account and we shall place
this question before the Party Congress due to be held in a week’s
time, sort it out and take a decision satisfactory to the non-Party
peasant and to the mass of the people. In our apparatus there is, of
course, much that is imperfect and inexcusable, because a great deal, a
very, very great deal of the bureaucratic practices has seeped in. But
weren’t there the same kind of mistakes and imperfections in our Red
Army? We could not rid ourselves of them right away, but thanks to the
help of the workers and peasants, the Army was, nevertheless, victorious.
What took place in the Red Army is bound to happen in another form in all
spheres, and we shall be cured of these bureaucratic
distortions—condemned on every hand because they are evidence of
our mistakes and misfortunes—by persistent work, not succumbing to
panic and not turning a blind eye to those who, taking advantage of these
mistakes, are trying to repeat the Kolchak and Denikin affairs. Any amount
of scandalous practices in the way of the pilfering of coal is taking
place in the Ukraine, while here we are suffering from a great shortage.
Over there they have had 120 governments, and the rich peasants have been
corrupted. They cannot understand that there is a workers’ and
peasants’ government and that, if it confiscates grain, it does so
in order to ease the position of the workers and peasants. Until we are
able to achieve full clarity on all these questions in that area, we shall
continue to receive news of disturbances, banditry and revolts. This is
inevitable because we have inherited from capitalism a peasant who is
isolated and cannot help being ignorant and full of resentment, and it
will take us years to re-educate him. We see this every spring, and we
shall continue to see it every spring for some time to come.
The south-eastern railways are quite another matter. This year we have
mainly existed on the resources supplied us by Siberia and the Northern
Caucasus. Here is a five-day report. It says 8 cars were sent in every day
from February 1; the second five-day report gives the figure of 32 cars;
the third, 60; the fourth, 109; but we should he receiving 200 cars a day,
and only in the last five clays, from February 20 to 24, have we been
getting ‘120 cars a day. That is three train-loads. Today Comrade
Fomin reports that during the past two days we have received four
train-loads. As one comrade has said, the position in the Donets Basin is
that there is no grain because there is no coal, and there is no coal
because there is no grain. This vicious circle must be broken at some
point by the energy, pressure and heroism of the working people, so that
all the wheels start turning. We are beginning to emerge from the enormous
difficulties that we have experienced in this respect. A ray of light has
appeared. I do not at all wish, comrades, to lull you with promises and I
have no intention of announcing that this difficult period has ended.
Nothing of the sort! There are signs of improvement, but the period
remains incredibly difficult, and, in comparison with last autumn, it need
not have been as difficult as it is now, despite the fact that we are cut
off from Western Europe. In order not to be cut off, we have had to accept
the idea of granting concessions: here’s your 500 per cent profit,
and let’s have more grain, paraffin oil, etc. We are prepared to
grant concessions, and will grant them. This will mean a new struggle,
because we are not going to give them 500 per cent, or perhaps even more,
without bargaining, and to switch to this struggle is equivalent to
switching all our trains onto new rails.
For this it is essential to convince the capitalists that they cannot
butt in on us with a war. We have decisively accepted the policy of
concessions. You know that we have had many arguments with the peasants
and workers about this, you know that the workers have said: ‘Have
we got rid of our own bourgeoisie only to let the foreigners in?” We
have explained to them that we cannot switch all at once from scarcity to
abundance, and in order to ease this transition, in order to obtain the
necessary amount of grain and textiles, we must be able to make every
necessary sacrifice. Let the capitalists benefit from their own greed, so
long as we are able to improve the position of the workers and peasants.
It is no easy thing, however, to get this concession business going. We
published a decree about this in November, but so far not a single
concession has been granted. Of course, this is due to the influence of
the white-guard and Menshevik press. Russian newspapers are now published
in every country in the world, and in all of them the Mensheviks are
clamouring against any concessions and saying that in Moscow things are
not going well, that the Soviet power is about to collapse, and that the
capitalists should not believe the Bolsheviks and should have nothing to
do with them. But we shall not abandon the fight: we have defeated the
capitalists, but we have not destroyed them; they have now moved on to
Warsaw, which once used to be the centre of the struggle against the
Russian autocracy, and is now the rallying point of the whiteguards
against Soviet Russia. We shall fight them everywhere, both on the foreign
and on the home front.
I have here a telegram from Comrade Zinoviev in Petrograd
      which says that, in connection with the arrests there, a
      leaflet found in the possession of one of those detained makes
      it clear that he is a spy of foreign capitalists. There is
      another leaflet, headed To the Faithful, which is
      also counter-revolutionary in content. Further, Comrade
      Zinoviev informs us that Menshevik leaflets posted up in
      Petrograd call for strikes, and over here in Moscow this has
      been blown up into a rumour about some kind of
      demonstration.

      In actual fact, one Communist was killed by an agent provocateur, and
      he is the only victim of these unhappy days. When Denikin was at Orel, the
      whiteguard papers said he was advancing at almost 100 versts an hour.
      These papers will not surprise us. We take a sober view of things. We must
      rally closer, comrades. Otherwise, what are we to do? Try another Kereusky
      or Kolchak “coalition” government? Kolchak, let us say, is no
      longer with us, but another might take his place. There are any number of
      Russian generals, quite enough for a large army. We must speak frankly and
      have no fear of the newspapers being published in all the cities of the
      world. These are all trifles, and we shall not keep silent about our
      difficult position because of them. But we shall say this: comrades, we
      are carrying on this difficult and bloody struggle, and if at the moment
      they cannot attack us with guns, they attack us with lies and slander,
      taking advantage of every instance of need and poverty in order to help
      our enemies. I repeat, all of this we have experienced and survived. We
      have lived through far greater difficulties; we know this enemy extremely
      well, and we shall defeat him this spring; we shall defeat him by working
      more successfully, and by calculating more carefully.
      (Applause.)

[1] The
      meeting was called by the Moscow Party Committee under a decision of an
      activists' meeting held on February 24, 1921. The plenary meeting heard a
      report on the food situation and Lenin's report on the international and
      domestic situation. It adopted a unanimous message to the workers,
      peasants and Red Army men of Moscow and Moscow Gubernia giving the reasons
      for the food crisis. It also called on them to fight the enemies, who
      tried to exploit those temporary food difficulties for their counter-
      revolutionary aims. The message was published in Pra vda No. 45, on March
      1, 1921.

      Negotiations between the governments of the R.S.F.S.R. and the Grand
      National Assembly of Turkey opened in Moscow on February 26, 1921, and
      ended with the signing, on March 16, of a treaty of friendship and
      brotherhood between the R.S.F.S.R. and Turkey. A treaty of friendship
      between Turkey and the Trans-Caucasian Soviet Republics, Armenia,
      Georgia and Azerbaijan, was signed in Kars on October 13.
[3] The talks
on the conclusion of a final peace treaty opened in Riga, after the
preliminary peace treaty between Poland, on the one hand, and Soviet
Russia and the Soviet Ukraine, on the other, was signed on October 12,
1920. The talks went on for five months. The Polish Government, instigated
by France, continued it aggressive acts against the Soviet Ukraine and
Soviet Byelorussia and hampered the peace conference in every way.
Decisive diplomatic action by the Soviet Government and the defeat of
Wrangel, who was an ally of bourgeois-landowner Poland, compelled the
Polish Government to conclude peace. The final peace treaty was signed in
Riga on March 18, 1921, under which Western Ukraine and Western
Byelorussia were ceded to Poland.

The Riga Peace Treaty was abrogated by the Soviet Government on
September 17, 1939, when Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia joined
the Soviet Union in accordance with the will of their peoples.

Please convey to the Georgian Communists, and in par-ticular
      to all members of the Georgian Revolutionary Com-mittee, my warm greetings
      to Soviet Georgia. My special request to them is to inform me whether or
      not we are in complete agreement on the following three questions:
First, immediate arming of the workers and poor peasants and formation
      of a strong Georgian Red Army.
Second, there is need for a special policy of concessions with regard to
      the Georgian intelligentsia and small mer-chants. It should be realised
      that it is not only imprudent to nationalise them, but that there is even
      need for certain sacrifices in order to improve their position and enable
      them to continue their small trade.
Third, it is of tremendous importance to devise an acceptable compromise
      for a bloc with Jordania or similar Georgian Mensheviks, who before the
      uprising had not been absolutely opposed to the idea of Soviet power in
      Georgia on certain Terms.
Please bear in mind that Georgia’s domestic and interna-tional
      positions both require that her Communists should avoid any mechanical
      copying of the Russian pattern. They must skilfully work out their own
      flexible tactics, based on bigger concessions to all the petty-bourgeois
      elements.
Please reply,
Lenin

      The gist of Bolshevism and the Russian October Revolution is
      getting into politics the very people who were most oppressed
      tinder capitalism. They were downtrodden, cheated and robbed by
      the capitalists, both under the monarchy and in the
      bourgeois-democratic republics. So long as the land and the
      factories were privately owned this oppression and deceit and
      the plunder of the people’s labour by the capitalists were
      inevitable.

      The essence of Bolshevism and the Soviet power is to expose the
      falsehood and mummery of bourgeois democracy, to abolish the
      private ownership of land and the factories and concentrate all
      state power in the hands of the working and exploited
      masses. They, these masses, get hold of politics, that is, of
      the business of building the new society. This is no easy task:
      the masses are downtrodden and oppressed by capitalism, but
      there is no other way—and there can be no other
      way—out of the wage-slavery and bondage of capitalism.

      But you cannot draw the masses into politics without drawing in
      the women as well. For under capitalism the female half of the
      human race is doubly oppressed. The working woman and the
      peasant woman are oppressed by capital, but over and above that,
      even in the most democratic of the bourgeois republics, they
      remain, firstly, deprived of some rights because the law does
      not give them equality with men; and secondly—and this is
      the main thing—they remain in household bondage", they
      continue to be “household slaves", for they are
      overburdened with the drudgery of the most squalid, backbreaking
      and stultifying toil in the kitchen and the family
      household.

      No party or revolution in the world has ever dreamed of striking
      so deep at the roots of the oppression and inequality of women
      as the Soviet, Bolshevik revolution is doing. Over here, in
      Soviet Russia, no trace is left of any inequality between men
      and women under the law. The Soviet power has eliminated all
      there was of the especially disgusting, base and hypocritical
      inequality in the laws on marriage and the family and inequality
      in respect of children.

      This is only the first step in the liberation of woman. But none
      of the bourgeois republics, including the most democratic, has
      dared to take oven this first step. The reason is awe of
      “sacrosanct private property.

      The second and most important step is the abolition of the
      private ownership of land and the factories. This and this alone
      opens up the way towards a complete and actual emancipation of
      woman, her liberation from “household bondage”
      through transition from petty individual housekeeping to
      large-scale socialised domestic services.

      This transition is a difficult one, because it involves the
      remoulding of the most deep-rooted, inveterate, hidebound and
      rigid “order” (indecency and barbarity would be
      nearer the truth). But the transition has been started, the
      thing has been set in motion, we have taken the new path.

      And so on this international working women’s day countless
      meetings of working women in all countries of the world will
      send greetings to Soviet Russia, which has been the first to
      tackle this unparalleled and incredibly hard but great task, a
      task that is universally great and truly
      liberatory. ‘[here will be bracing calls not to lose heart
      in face of the fierce and frequently savage bourgeois
      reaction. The “freer” or “more
      democratic” a bourgeois country is, the wilder the rampage
      of its gang of capitalists against the workers’
      revolution, an example of this being the democratic republic of
      the United Slates of North America. But the mass of workers have
      already awakened. The dormant, somnolent and inert masses in
      America, Europe and even in backward Asia were finally roused by
      the imperialist war.

      The ice has been broken in every corner of the world.

      Nothing can stop the tide of the peoples’ liberation from
      the imperialist yoke and the liberation of working men and women
      from the yoke of capital. This cause is being carried forward by
      tens and hundreds of millions of working men and women in town
      and countryside. That is why this cause of labour’s
      freedom from the yoke, of capital will triumph all over the
      world.

[1]  The
Tenth Party Congress was held in Moscow on March 8-16, 1921. It was
      attended by 694 delegates with voice and vote and 296 with voice only.
      They represented 732,521 Party members. The items on the agenda were:  1)
      Report of the Central Committee 2) Report of the Control Commission; 3)
      The trade unions’ economic role; 4) The Socialist Republic in a
      capitalist encirclement foreign trade, concessions, etc.; 5) Food supply,
      surplus-food appropriation, tax in kind and fuel crisis, 6) Problems of
      Party organisation; 7) The Party’s current tasks in the
      nationalities question; 8) Reorganisation of the army and the militia
      question; 9) The Chief Administration for Political Education and the
      Party’s propaganda and agitation work; 10) Report of the
      R.C.P.’s representative in the Comintern, and its current tasks; 11)
      Report of the R.C.P.’s representatives in the International Trade
      Union Council; 12) Elections to the Central Committee, the Control
      Commission and the Auditing Commission. The Congress resolutions dealt
      with the key political and economic problems. 
 Lenin lead much of the work of the Congress: he
      delivered the opening and closing speeches and gave reports on the
      political activity of the C.C., the substitution of a tax in kind for the
      surplus appropriation system, the Party’s unity and the
      anarcho-syndicalist deviation, the trade unions and the fuel crisis. He
      drafted the main resolutions. He gave a theoretical and political
      substantiation of the necessity of transition from War Communism to the
      New Economic Policy (NEP). The Congress adopted historic decisions on the
      substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system, and
      the transition to NEP, which was designed to draw millions of peasants
      into the organization of the planned socialist economy. 
 The Congress paid special attention to the
      Party’s unity. Lenin exposed and sharply criticised the anti-Marxist
      views of the opposition groups. The resolution “On Party
      Unity” adopted on Lenin’s motion ordered the immediate
      dissolution of all factions and groups which tended to weaken the
      Party’s unity. The Congress authorised the Central Committee to
      apply, as an extreme measure, expulsion from the Party to C.C. members who
      engaged in factional activity. 
 The Congress also adopted Lenin’s draft
      resolution “On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in our
      Party”, which exposed the views of the Workers’ Opposition as
      an expression of petty-bourgeois, anarchist vacillations. The propaganda
      of anarcho-syndicalist ideas was found to be incompatible with membership
      in the Party. With the country engaged in peaceful socialist construction,
      the Congress came down in favour of broader democracy within the Party.
    
 The Congress summed up the discussion on the trade
      unions’ role in economic development, condemned the ideas of the ,
      the Workers’ Opposition, the Democratic Centralism group and other 
      trends, and approved Lenin’s platform by an overwhelming majority,
      terming the trade unions as a school of communism, and suggesting measures
      to develop trade union democracy. 
 A commission headed by Lenin worked out the
      Congress’s decisions on the Party’s nationalities policy in
      the new conditions: to eliminate the actual inequality of peoples which
      had been oppressed in tsarist Russia, and draw them into socialist
      construction. The Congress condemned the anti-Party deviations on the
      nationalities question, great-power chauvinism and local nationalism,
      which were a grave danger to communism and proletarian internationalism.
    
 On the newly elected 25-man Central Committee were
      Lenin, Artyom (F. A. Sergeyev), F. E. Dzerzhinsky, Leon Trotsky, L.
      Kamanev, G. Zinoviev, M. I. Kalinin, G. K. Orjonikidze, M. V. Frunze, Y.
      E. Rudzutak, J. V. Stalin, Y. M. Yaroslavsky; S. M. Kirov, V. V.
      Kuibysllev, V. Y. Chubar were among the alternate members. 
 The historic decisions of the Tenth Congress charted
      the ways of transition from capitalism to socialism, and methods of
      construction of socialism in the new conditions; they stressed the
      importance of greater unity between the proletariat and the peasantry, and
      stronger Party leadership in the construction of Soviet Russia.

      Comrades, may I thank you all for your greetings and ask you to
      accept my greetings to your Congress. (Stormy
      applause.) Allow me to digress before dealing with the
      subject that directly concerns the work and tasks of this
      Congress and what the Soviet state expects of it.

      As I was coming in through your hail just now, I saw a placard
      with this inscription: “The reign of the workers and
      peasants will last for ever.” When I read this odd
      placard, which, it is true, was not up in the usual place, but
      stood in a corner-perhaps it had occurred to someone that it was
      not very apt and he had moved it out of the way when I read this
      strange placard, I thought to myself: there you have some of the
      fundamental and elementary things we are still confused
      about. Indeed, if the reign of the workers and peasants would
      last for ever, we should never have socialism, for it implies
      the abolition of classes; and as long as there are workers and
      peasants, there will be different classes and, therefore, no
      full socialism. And as I pondered over the fact that three and a
      half years after the October Revolution we still have such odd
      placards (even if they are shifted out of the way) it occurred
      to me that there may still be great misunderstanding of the most
      common slogans in popular use. Take one of our most popular
      slogans which we all variously repeat: we all sing about our
      present fight being the last and decisive one. But I am afraid
      that if we were to ask a large section of the Communists against
      whom they are now waging this last battle (not the last one, of
      course, that’s putting it on a bit thick, but one of the
      last and crucial ones) 1 am afraid only a few would give the
      right answer showing a clear understanding against what, or
      whom, we are now waging one of our last and decisive battles. It
      also seems to me that, in view of the political events which
      have caught the attention of the broad masses of workers and
      peasants, we ought once again to ascertain, or, at any rate, try
      to ascertain, against whom we are waging one of our last and
      crucial battles this spring, at this very moment. Let me go over
      this point.

      To sort it out we should, I think, start by reviewing as
      precisely and as soberly as possible, the opposed forces on
      whose struggle hinges the fate of the Soviet power, and,
      generally speaking, the course and development of the
      proletarian revolution, which is a revolution for the overthrow
      of the capitalists in Russia and elsewhere. What are these
      forces? Bow are they grouped against one another? How are they
      deployed at present? Any marked aggravation of the political
      situation, every new turn in the political events, even if it is
      not considerable, should always cause every thinking worker and
      peasant to ask himself: “What are the forces involved? How
      are they grouped?” And only when we are able to estimate
      these forces correctly and quite soberly, irrespective of our
      sympathies and desires, shall we be able to draw the proper
      conclusions concerning our policy in general, and our immediate
      tasks in particular. Let me, therefore, give you a brief
      description of these forces.

      There are basically three such forces. Take first the
      proletariat, the force that is closest to us. It is the first
      force, the first discrete class. You all know this very well,
      living in the very midst of it. What is its condition now? In
      the Soviet Republic it is the class that took power three and a
      half years ago, that has, since then, been exercising its
      domination-dictatorship-and has suffered and endured exhaustion,
      want and privation more than any other class. To the working
      class, to the proletariat, this period, during the greater part
      of which the Soviet state was engaged in a relentless civil war
      against the whole capitalist world, brought calamities,
      privation, sacrifice and intense want on a scale unparalleled in
      world history. A strange thing happened. The class that took
      political power did so in the knowledge that it was doing so
      alone.

      That is intrinsic to the concept of the dictatorship of the
      proletariat. It has meaning only when one class knows that it is
      taking political power alone, and does not deceive others or
      itself with talk about “popular government by popular
      consent through universal suffrage”. You all know that
      there are very many-far too many-people who love to hold forth
      on that subject, but, at any rate, you will not find them among
      proletarians, because they have realised that theirs is a
      dictatorship of the proletariat, and they say as much in their
      Constitution, the fundamental law of the Republic. This class
      was well aware that it was taking power alone, under extremely
      difficult conditions. It has exercised its political power as
      any dictatorship does, that is, with grim determination. In
      these three and a half years, it has suffered distress, want,
      starvation and a worsening of economic positions such as no
      other class in history has suffered. It is not surprising that
      as a result of its superhuman effort it is uncommonly weary,
      exhausted and strained.

      How was a single class able to exercise its power in the teeth
      of the resistance and attacks of the world bourgeoisie, in a
      country where the proletariat is numerically so much smaller
      than the rest of the population? How was it able to do that in a
      backward country artificially cut off by armed force from
      countries with a more numerous, class-conscious, disciplined and
      organised proletariat? How could it hold on for three and a half
      years? What was its mainstay? We know that it was the mass of
      the peasants, at home. About this second force more in a moment,
      after we finish our examination of the first. I have said that
      never has its suffering been so great and acute as in this epoch
      of its dictatorship; and you all know it, having observed the
      life of your mates in the factories, railway depots, and
      workshops. Never before has the country been so weary and worn
      out, Where did this class get the moral strength to bear those
      privations? Clearly it had to draw on some source for the moral
      strength to overcome these material privations. As you know, the
      question of moral strength and support is a vague one; you can
      give any reading to moral strength. To avoid the danger of
      reading anything vague or fantastic into “moral
      strength”, 1 ask myself: Is there a precise definition of
      that which gave the proletariat the moral strength to bear the
      unprecedented material privations connected with its political
      rule? I think this will give us a precise answer. Ask yourself:
      Could the Soviet Republic have borne its trials over three and a
      half years, and withstood the onslaught of the whiteguards
      supported by the capitalists of the world, if it had had to face
      backward instead of advanced countries? You have only to put the
      question to see the obvious answer.

      You know that for three and a hall years the wealthiest powers
      of the world fought against us. The armed forces that were
      ranged against us and that supported Kolchak, Yudenich, Denikin
      and Wrangel—you all know this very well, for you all
      fought in the war—were immensely and clearly superior to
      our forces. You know perfectly well that these states are still
      very much stronger than we are. How is it, then, that they set
      out to vanquish the Soviet power, and failed? How did this
      happen? We have an exact answer: the proletariat of all the
      capitalist countries was on our side. Even when it was patently
      under the influence of the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries-in the European countries they go by
      another name-it refused to support the fight against
      us. Eventually, the leaders were compelled to yield to the
      masses, and the workers disrupted the war. It was not we who
      won, for our armed forces were insignificant; the victory was
      won because the powers could not hurl the whole of their armed
      force against us. The course of a war depends on the workers of
      the advanced countries to such an extent that it cannot be waged
      against their will, and their passive and semi-passive
      resistance eventually disrupted the war against us. This
      incontrovertible fact gives the exact answer to the question as
      to the source on which the Russian proletariat drew for moral
      strength to hold out for three and a half years and win. The
      moral strength of the Russian worker lay in his knowledge and
      awareness of the tangible assistance and support which the
      proletariat of all the advanced countries of Europe was giving
      him in this struggle. The direction which the working-class
      movement in these countries is taking is indicated by this most
      important recent event: the split in the Socialist parties of
      Britain, France, Italy,  and other countries (both vanquished
      and victors) which differ in cultural and economic
      development. The main development of the year in all countries
      has been the formation of Communist Parties, with the support of
      all that is most advanced in the working class, on the ruins of
      the Socialist and Social-Democratic parties—which in
      Russia are called Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary. And, of
      course, there can be no doubt that if we had been attacked by
      backward countries, without mighty proletarian masses, and not
      by advanced countries, we would have been unable to hold out for
      three and a half months, let alone three and a half years. Would
      our proletariat have had the moral strength if it had not relied
      on the sympathy of the workers of the advanced countries, who
      supported us in spite of the lies about the Soviet power
      circulated by the imperialists in millions of copies, and in
      spite of the efforts of the “labour
      leaders”—the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionarieswho could have been expected to, and
      did, hamper the workers’ struggle for us? With this
      support, our proletariat—numerically weak and tormented by
      poverty and privation—won out because it had the moral
      strength.

      That is the first force.

      The second is that which stands between developed capital and
      the proletariat. It is the petty bourgeoisie, the small
      proprietors, which in Russia constitute the overwhelming
      majority of the population—the peasantry. They are mainly
      small proprietors and small farmers. Nine-tenths of them are
      that way, and can be nothing else. They do not take part in the
      acute struggle daily waged by capital and labour. They have not
      been schooled; their economic and political conditions do not
      bring them together, but rather tend to separato, alienating
      them from each other, and transforming them into millions of
      lone-wolf small proprietors. Such are the facts and you are all
      perfectly well aware of them. It will take collectives,
      collective farms and communes years to change this. Thanks to
      the revolutionary energy and devotion of the proletarian
      dictatorship, this force was able to dispose of its enemies on
      the right-the landowner class—to sweep them right out and
      abolish their rule more swiftly than has ever been done
      before. But the more quickly it abolished the rule of the
      landowners, the more quickly it turned to its farming on the
      nationalised land, the more resolutely it settled accounts with
      the small minority of kulaks, the sooner it itself became
      transformed into small proprietors. You know that there has been
      a levelling-off in the Russian countryside in this period. The
      number of peasants with large areas under crop and without any
      at all has decreased, while the number of medium farms has
      increased. The countryside has become more potty bourgeois. This
      is an independent class, which the landowners and capitalists
      are expelled and eliminated, is the only class capable of
      opposing the proletariat. That is why it is absurd to write on
      placards that the reign of the workers and peasants will last
      for ever.

      You know the political mood oi this force. It is a vacillating
      force. We saw this to be true during our revolution all over the
      country. There were some local features in Russia proper,
      Siberia and the Ukraine, but the result was the same everywhere:
      it is a vacillating force. For a long time it was in the leading
      strings of the SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviks, with the
      aid of Kerensky, in the Kolchak period, under the Constituent
      Assembly in Samara, when the Menshevik Maisky was a Minister of
      Kolchak or of one of his predecessors, etc. This force wavered
      between the leadership of the proletariat and that of the
      bourgeoisie. Why didn’t it lead itself? After all, it is
      the overwhelming majority. The fact is that the economic
      conditions of these masses are such that they are unable to
      organise and unite by their own efforts. This is clear to anyone
      who is not misled by empty talk about “universal
      suffrage”, a constituent assembly and such like
      “democracy” which has served to dupe the people in
      all countries for hundreds of years and which the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in our own country
      played up for hundreds of weeks but fell through “on this
      very spot every blessed time”. (Applause.) We
      know from our own experience—and revolutions all over the
      world confirm it if we take the modern epoch of, say, a hundred
      and fifty years—that the result has always been the same
      everywhere: the petty bourgeoisie in general, and the peasants
      in particular, have failed in all their attempts to realise
      their strength, and to direct economics and politics their own
      way. They have had to follow the leadership either of the
      proletariat, or the capitalists—there is no middle way
      open to them. Anyone who thinks of a middle way is an empty
      dreamer. There is much politics, economics, and history to prove
      it. The teachings of Marx show that once the small proprietors
      become owners of the means of production and land, exchange
      between them necessarily gives rise to capital, and
      simultaneously to the antagonisms between capital and
      labour. The struggle between capital and the proletariat is
      inevitable; it is a law manifesting itself all over the
      world. This must he accepted by anyone who refuses to fool
      himself.

      These fundamental economic facts explain why this force cannot
      manifest itself through its own efforts, and why it has always
      failed in all its attempts to do so in the history of all
      revolutions. Whenever the proletariat was unable to lead the
      revolution, this force always followed the leadership of the
      bourgeoisie. That was the case in all revolutions. The Russians,
      of course, are of the same clay, and if they choose to pretend
      they are not, they will only look ridiculous. History metes out
      the same treatment to all. We, in particular, saw the truth of
      this under the rule of Kerensky. At that time, the government
      had the support of very many more political leaders than the
      Bolsheviks have, They were clever, educated men, with vast
      experience in politics and state administration. If we were to
      count all the officials who sabotaged us, but who did not make
      it their business to sabotage the Kerensky government, which
      relied on the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, we would
      find that they made up an overwhelming majority. Still that
      government collapsed. That shows that there were factors which
      offset the enormous preponderance of intellectual and educated
      forces accustomed to administering the state, an art they had
      acquired decades before they actually took over. Events ran the
      same course, with some modifications, in the Ukraine, the Don
      and the Kuban regions, and the result was exactly the same. That
      could not have been a coincidence. Such is the economic and
      political law governing the second force: hence, either the
      leadership of the proletariat—a hard road, but one which
      can help it to escape the rule of the landowners and
      capitalists—or the leadership of the capitalists, as it
      does in the advanced democratic republics, and even in America,
      where the free distribution of land (every settler was allotted
      sixty dessiatines[about 160
      acres—Translator] free of chargebetter
      conditions can hardly be imagined!) has not yet entirely
      stopped, and where this has led to the complete domination of
      capital.

      That is the second force.

      Over here it is wavering, and is particularly weary. It has had
      to bear the burdens of the revolution, and in the past few years
      fresh burdens have been thrust upon it: a year of crop failure,
      surplus-grain appropriations, with cattle dying off because of
      the fodder shortage, etc. In the circumstances, it is not
      surprising that this second force the masses of the
      peasantry—should give way to despair. They could not think
      of improving their condition although three and a half years
      have passed since the landowners were driven out, yet the
      improvement is becoming an urgent necessity. The dispersing army
      fails to find proper employment for its labour-power, and so
      this petty-bourgeois force is being transformed into an anarchic
      element, whose restiveness is an expression of its demands.

      You are all familiar with the third force: the landowners and
      capitalists. It is no longer conspicuous in this country. But
      one crucial event, one critical lesson of the past few
      weeks—the Kronstadt events—was like a flash of
      lightning which threw more of a glare upon reality than anything
      else.

      There is now no country in Europe without some whiteguard
      elements. Russian Ã©migrds in Europe have been estimated to total
      about seven hundred thousand. These are fugitive capitalists and
      the mass of office workers who could not adapt themselves to
      Soviet rule. We see nothing of this third force, it has
      emigrated, but it lives and operates in alliance with the
      capitalists of the world, who are assisting it as they assisted
      Kolchak, Yudenich and Wrangel, with money and in other ways,
      because they have their international bonds. We all remember
      these people. You must have noticed the abundance of extracts
      from the whiteguard press in our newspapers over the last few
      days, explaining the events in Kronstadt. In the last few days,
      they have been described by Burtsev, who puts out a newspaper in
      Paris, and have been appraised by Milyukov—you must have
      all read this. Why have our newspapers devoted so much attention
      to it? Was it right to do so? It was, because we must have a
      clear view of our enemy. Abroad, they are not so conspicuous,
      but you will find that they have not moved very far away, just a
      few thousand versts at most; and having moved that far, have
      taken cover. They are alive and kicking, and lying in wait. That
      is why we must keep a close watch on them, especially because
      they are more than just refugees. Indeed, they are the agents of
      world capital, who work with it hand in glove.

      You must have noticed that these extracts from the whiteguard
      newspapers published abroad appeared side by side with extracts
      from British and French newspapers. They are one chorus, one
      orchestra. It is true that such orchestras are not conducted by
      a man with a score. International capital uses less conspicuous
      means than a conductor’s baton, but that it is one
      orchestra should be clear from any one of these extracts. They
      have admitted that if the slogan becomes “Soviet power
      without the Bolsheviks” they will all accept it. Milyukov
      explains this with particular clarity. He has made a close study
      of history, and has had a refresher course in Russian history at
      first hand. He has supplemented his twenty years of book
      learning with twenty months of personal experience. He says he
      is prepared to accept the “Soviet power without the
      Bolsheviks” slogan. He cannot see from over there in Paris
      whether this is to be a slight shift to the right or to the
      left, towards the anarchists. From over there, he cannot see
      what is going on in Kronstadt, but asks the monarchists not to
      rush and spoil things by shouting about it. He declares that
      even if the shift is to be to the left, he is prepared to back
      the Soviet power against the Bolsheviks.

      This is what Milyukov says, and it is absolutely right. When he
      says that the Kronstadt events reveal an urge to set up a Soviet
      regime without the Bolsheviks, he shows that he has learned
      something from Russian history and from the landowners and
      capitalists. It is a demand for a slight shift to the right,
      with a little bit of unrestricted trade, and a little bit of a
      constituent assembly—listen to any Menshevik, and you will
      hear it all, perhaps even without leaving this hail. If the
      slogan of the Kronstadt events is a slight deviation to the
      left—Soviet power with the anarchists, begotten by
      distress, war, the demobilisation of the army—why is
      Milyukov in favour of it? Because he knows that a deviation
      leads either to the proletarian dictatorship or to the
      capitalists.

      Political power cannot exist in any other way. Although we are
      not waging our last battle but one of the last and decisive
      battles, the only correct answer to the question “Against
      whom shall we wage one of the decisive battles today?” is:
      “Against petty-bourgeois anarchy at home.”
      (Applause.) As for the landowners and capitalists, we
      beat them in the first campaign, but only in the first one: the
      second is to be waged on an international scale. Modern
      capitalism cannot fight against us, even if it were a hundred
      times stronger, because over there, in the advanced countries,
      the workers disrupted its war yesterday and will disrupt it even
      more effectively tcday, because over there the consequences of
      the war are beginning to toll more and more. We have defeated
      the petty-bourgeois element at home, but it will make itself
      felt again. And that is taken into account by the landowners and
      the capitalists, particularly the clever ones, like Milyukov,
      who has told the monarchists: “Sit still, keep quiet,
      otherwise you will only strengthen the Soviet power.” This
      has been proved by the general course of the revolutions in
      which the toilers, with temporary peasant support, set up
      short-lived dictatorships but had no consolidated power, so that
      after a brief period everything tended to slip back. This
      happened because the peasants, the toilers, the small
      proprietors, can have no policy of their own and must retreat
      alter a period of vacillation. That was the case in the Great
      French Revolution, and, on a smaller scale, in all
      revolutions. And, of course, everyone has learned this
      lesson. Cur whiteguards crossed the frontier, rode off a
      distance of three days’ journey, and, backed and supported
      by West-European capital, are lying in wait and watching. Such
      is the situation. It makes clear the tasks and duties of the
      proletariat.

      Weariness and exhaustion produce a certain mood, and sometimes
      lead to desperation. As usual, this tends to breed anarchism
      among the revolutionary elements. That was the case in all
      capitalist countries, and that is what is taking place in our
      own country. The petty-bourgeois element is in the grip of a
      crisis because it has had it hard over the past few years; not
      as hard as the proletariat had it in 1919, but hard,
      nevertheless. The peasantry had to save the state by accepting
      the surplus-grain appropriations without remuneration, but it
      can no longer stand the strain. That is why there is confusion
      and vacillation in its midst, and this is being taken into
      account by the capitalist enemy, who says: “All it needs
      is a little push, and it will start snowballing.” That is
      the meaning of the Kronstadt events in the light of the
      alignment of class, forces in the whole of Russia and on the
      international scale. That is the meaning of one of our last and
      crucial battles, for we have not beaten this
      petty-bourgeois—anarchist element, and the immediate fate
      of the revolution now depends on whether or not we succeed in
      doing so. If we do not, we shall slide down as the French
      Revolution did. This is inevitable, and we must not let
      ourselves be misled by phrases and excuses. We must do all we
      can to alleviate the position of these masses and safeguard the
      proletarian leadership. If we do this, the growing movement of
      the communist revolution in Europe will be further
      reinforced. What has not. yet taken place there today, may well
      take place tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, but in world
      history such periods, as between today and tomorrow, mean no
      less than a few years.

      That is my answer to the question as to what we are now fighting
      for, in one of our last and crucial battles. That is my reading
      of recent events and the significance of the class struggle in
      Russia. It is now clear why it has become so acute and why we
      find it so hard to see that the chief enemy is not Yudenich,
      Kolchak or Denikin, but our own conditions.

      I can now go on to the concluding part of my speech (which is
      already too long), namely, the state of railway and water
      transport, and the tasks of the Railway and Water Transport
      Workers’ Congress. 1 think that what I have had to
      describe here is very intimately bound up with these
      tasks. There is hardly another section of the proletariat which
      comes so closely into contact with industry and agriculture in
      its everyday economic activity as the railway and water
      transport workers. You must supply the cities with food, and
      revive the rural areas by carrying the manufactured goods to
      them. That is clear to everyone, but it is much clearer to
      railway and water transport workers, because that is their
      everyday work. And from this, I think, follow the exceptionally
      important tasks and the responsibility now falling to the
      railway and water transport workers.

      You all know that your Congress has been meeting just after some
      friction between the upper and the lower echelons of the
      union. When this question was brought up at the last Party
      Congress, decisions were adopted to reconcile them by
      subordinating the upper echelons to the lower, by rectifying the
      upper echelons’ mistakes, which I think were of a minor
      nature but needed rectifying. You know that the Party Congress
      rectified these mistakes, that the Congress closed on a note of
      greater solidarity and unity in the ranks of the Communist Party
      than before. That is the legitimate, necessary and only correct
      reply that the vanguard, i.e., the leading section of the
      proletariat, can give to the movement of the
      petty-bourgeois-anarchist element. If we class-conscious workers
      realise the danger of this movement, if we rally our forces,
      work much more harmoniously and show a great deal more of
      solidarity, we shall multiply our forces. After our victory over
      the military attack, we shall conquer the vacillations and
      wavering of this element that is disturbing the whole of our
      everyday life and for that reason is, I repeat, dangerous. The
      decisions of the Party Congress, which rectified what was called
      to its attention, signify a great step forward in increasing the
      solidarity and unity of the proletarian army. Your Congress must
      do the same thing and implement the decisions of the Party
      Congress.

      I repeat: the fate of the revolution depends more immediately
      upon the work of this section of the proletariat than upon any
      other. We must restore the exchange between agriculture and
      industry, and we need a material basis to do so. What is it? It
      is railway and water transport. That is why it is your duty to
      dedicate yourselves to your work and this applies not only to
      those of you who are members of the Communist Party, and are
      therefore conscious vehicles of the proletarian dictatorship,
      but also to those of you who do not belong to the Party, but
      represent a transport workers trade union with a million, or a
      million and a half, members. All of you, learning the lessons of
      our revolution and of all preceding revolutions, must understand
      the full gravity of the present situation. If you do not allow
      yourselves to be blinded by all sorts of slogans such as
      “Freedom”, “Constituent Assembly”,
      “Free Soviets”—it is so easy to switch labels
      that even Milyukov has turned up as a supporter of the Soviets
      of a Kronstadt republic—if you do not close your eyes to
      the alignment of class forces, you will acquire a sound and firm
      basis for all your political conclusions. You will then see that
      we are passing through a period of crisis in which it depends on
      us whether the proletarian revolution continues to march to
      victory as surely as before, or whether the vacillations and
      waverings lead to the victory of the whiteguards, which will not
      alleviate the situation, but will set Russia hack from the
      revolution for many decades. The only conclusion that you,
      representatives of railway and water transport workers, can and
      should draw is—let’s have much more proletarian
      solidarity and discipline. Comrades, we must achieve this at all
      costs, and win. (Stormy applause.)

Dear comrades,

    

      Comrade Smirnov, Chairman of your Trade Union Committee, has
      informed me of the production of motors and has invited me to
      attend the ceremony on April 7.

      Please accept my congratulations, comrades, on the success of
      your efforts and the anniversary of the courses for
      mechanics. With all my heart, I wish you vigorous pursuit of
      your work, in which you are sure to score further
      successes. They are of especial significance from the standpoint
      of the whole mass of workers and peasants, because, the
      development of motor production in Russia, with her abundant oil
      resources, holds out the possibility of organising the supply of
      peasant farms with efficient and low-cost machines. You must do
      all you can to make motor manufacture an even greater
      success.

      With best wishes and communist greetings,

      Lenin

Comrades, one hears the most varied and highly confusing opinions on the question of the tax in kind and the change in our food policy, and also on the Soviet government’s economic policy. Permit me, by arrangement with Comrade Kamenev, to share our subjects in such a way that he will give a detailed outline of the laws which have just been issued. This will be all the more appropriate for he chaired the commission which was appointed by the Party’s Central Committee and later endorsed by the Council of People’s Commissars, and which drew up all the recent laws at a number of conferences with representatives of the departments concerned. The last of these laws was issued yesterday, and we saw it in the newspapers this morning. There is no doubt that each of these laws raises a number of practical questions, and it will take some work to familiarise all the local Party and Soviet workers with them and to devise the proper methods of applying them in the localities.
I should like to draw your attention to their general significance, or the principle behind them. How are we to explain the fact that the Soviet government and the dictatorship of the proletariat are about to accept some freedom of trade? To what extent can unrestricted trade and individual enterprise be permitted side by side with the socialist economy? To what extent can we permit such a revival of capitalism, which may seem to be inevitable with a free market, however restricted? What has called forth this change? What is its real meaning, character and significance? And how should members of the Communist Party understand it? How is it to be explained, and what are the limits of its practical application? This, approximately, is the task I have set myself.
The first question is: what has called forth this change, which many think to be too drastic and not sufficiently justified?
The fundamental and principal reason for the change is the extraordinarily acute crisis of peasant farming, and its very difficult condition, which has proved to be much harder by the spring of 1921 than could have been expected. On the other hand, its consequences have affected the restoration of our transport system and of our industry. I should like to point out that most mistakes on the question of substituting the tax in kind for the surplus-grain appropriation system, and on the significance of the change, are made because there is no effort to analyse the nature of the change and its implications. Here is a picture of peasant farming by the spring of 1921: an extremely severe crisis caused by the war-time ruin and aggravated by a disastrous crop failure and the resultant fodder shortage (for the failure also affected the hay crop) and loss of cattle; and the weakening of the productive forces of peasant farming, which in many places was doomed to utter ruin. And here we come to this question: what is the connection between this terribly acute crisis of peasant farming and the Soviet government’s abolition of the surplus-grain appropriation system? I say that if we are to understand this measure we must ask ourselves: what is the transition we are making?
In the event of a workers’ revolution in a country with a predominantly peasant population, with the factories, works and railways taken over by the working class, what, in essence, should be the economic relations between the working class and the peasantry? They should obviously be the following: the workers producing in the factories and works, which now belong to them, all that is necessary for the country—and that means also for the peasants, who constitute the majority of the population—should transport all these things on their railroads and river vessels and deliver them to the peasants, in return for the surplus agricultural produce. This is absolutely obvious and hardly requires detailed explanation although it is constantly forgotten in the tax discussions. But it should be borne in mind, because if we are to explain the significance of the tax in kind, which is only a transitional measure, we must have a clear understanding of what we want to achieve. What I have said makes it clear that we do not want the peasants’ products to be delivered to the workers’ state as appropriations of surplus grain, or a tax. We want them in exchange for all the goods the peasants need delivered to them by our transport system. We must have such an arrangement. It is a basis for the economy of a country which has adopted socialism. If peasant farming is to develop, we must also assure its transition to the next stage which must inevitably be one of gradual amalgamation of the small, isolated peasant farms—the least profitable and most backward—into large-scale collective farms. That is how socialists have always visualised it, and that is exactly how our own Communist Party sees it. I repeat, the greatest source of error and confusion is in appraising the tax in kind without making allowance for the specific features of the transitional measures which we must take, if we are to attain the goals which we can and must reach.
What, then, is the tax in kind? It is a measure in which we see something of the past and something of the future. A tax is something the state takes from the population without compensation. If it is fixed at approximately one half of last year’s rate of surplus-grain appropriations it alone will not suffice for the workers’ state to maintain its Red Army, the whole of industry, and the whole of the non-agricultural population, and to develop production and relations with foreign countries, whose assistance in the way of machinery and equipment we need. On the one hand, the workers’ state wants to rely on the tax at approximately one-half the surplus-grain appropriations rate, and on the other, on the exchange of manufactured goods for the surplus products of peasant farming. Hence, the tax contains a moiety of the old appropriation system and a moiety of that which is the only correct system, namely, the exchange of the manufactures of big socialist factories for the products of peasant farming through the medium of food supply organisations of the working-class state and workers’ and peasants’ co-operative societies.
Why are we compelled to resort to a measure of which a moiety belongs to the past and a moiety only is put on proper lines? After all, we are not at all sure that we shall be able to put it on proper lines at once, or that it will be at all considerable. Why are we compelled to resort to such a half-measure? Why must we rely on such measures in our food and economic policy? What is it that makes it imperative? Everyone knows, of course, that it is not the Soviet government’s preference for some particular policy. It is the grinding need and the desperate situation. You know that for several years after the victory of the workers’ revolution in Russia, after the imperialist war, we had to endure a civil war, and it is now no exaggeration to say that Russia suffered more than any other country involved in the imperialist war, including those which had suffered because it was fought on their territory. For after four years of imperialist war we endured three years of civil war, which brought more havoc and industrial dislocation than any external war, because it was fought in the very heart of the country. This terrible devastation is the main reason why initially during the war—particularly when the Civil War cut us off from grain areas, like Siberia, the Caucasus and the whole of the Ukraine, and from our supplies of coal and oil, and reduced our possibilities of obtaining other types of fuel—we could hold out—in a besieged fortress—only through the surplus-grain appropriation system, that is, by taking from the peasant whatever surplus produce was available, and sometimes even a part of his necessaries, in order to keep the army in fighting trim and to prevent industry from going to pieces altogether. During the Civil War, this problem was one of extraordinary difficulty, and was declared insoluble by all the other parties. Take the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, i.e., the parties of the petty bourgeoisie and the kulaks. At the most acute moments of the Civil War they did the most shouting about the Bolsheviks’ having undertaken a crazy task, and the impossibility of holding out when all the powers were assisting the whiteguards. Indeed, the problem was one of exceptional difficulty, and called for a supreme effort. It was successfully solved only because of what, you might say, was the superhuman sacrifices on the part of the working class and the peasantry. The working class never suffered such malnutrition, such starvation, as it did in the first years of its dictatorship. This naturally left as the only alternative the appropriation system, which meant taking from the peasant all of his surplus and a part of his necessaries. He was told: “You, too, will have to go hungry for a while, but together we shall save our cause and drive off Denikin and Wrangel.” That was the only conceivable solution.
This was not an economic system or an economic plan for a policy, adopted from a number of possible choices. That was not the case at all. We could not think of restoring industry without ensuring a minimum of food and fuel. Appropriation of surpluses without remuneration—because you can’t call paper currency remuneration—was the only answer to the task we set ourselves to preserve the remnants of industry, to keep the workers from dispersing altogether, and to maintain the army. We had no other way out. That is what we are discarding, and I have already told you what we are adopting. The tax is to help us make the transition. If it were possible to restore our industry faster, then perhaps, with a better harvest, we could make an earlier transition to the exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural products.
Many of you may remember that the question of switching efforts to the economic front was raised at the Ninth Party Congress. At the time, all attention was focused on it. We thought that we had finished with the war: after all, we did offer bourgeois Poland incredibly favourable peace terms. But the peace was disrupted, and there followed the Polish war and its sequel—Wrangel, etc. The period between the Ninth and the Tenth congresses was almost entirely a period of war. You know that we signed a final peace treaty with the Poles only very recently; and a few days ago we signed a peace agreement with the Turks, which alone will rid us of interminable wars in the Caucasus. We have only now concluded a trade agreement with Britain, which is of world-wide significance. Only now has Britain been compelled to enter into commercial relations with us. America, for example, still refuses to do so. This will give you an idea of how hard it was for us to extricate ourselves from the war. Had we been able to realise the anticipations of the Ninth Congress right away, we would, of course, have been able to provide a much larger quantity of goods.
Today I had a visit from Comrade Korolyov of Ivanovo-Voznesensk, our most industrial, proletarian, Red gubernia. He gave me some facts and figures. In the first year only six factories were in operation, and not one of them ran for a month without stoppages. Industry was grinding down to a standstill. During the past year, 22 factories were started for the first time, some running for several months, others up to half a year, without stoppages. The planned target was set at 150 million arshins, and according to the latest figures they produced 117 million arshins, getting only half the fuel they had been allocated. That is how production plans were disrupted, not only in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, but all over Russia. This was due to a large extent to the decline of peasant farming, to loss of cattle, and the impossibility of transporting a sufficient quantity of firewood to the railway stations and river wharves, all of which gave Ivanovo-Voznesensk less firewood, less peat, and less oil than it should have had. The miracle is that, with only half the fuel they should have got, they turned out 117 million arshins of the planned 150 million. They increased the productivity of labour and transferred the workers to the best factories, obtaining a high percentage of output. Here is a pretty good example, on our own doorstep, illustrating our position. The Ninth Congress fixed the textile target output at over 600 million arshins, but we produced less than one-third of this because even Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, which proved to be the best, made only 117 million arshins. Picture to yourselves Russia’s millions and these 117 million arshins of cotton goods! This is poverty! The rehabilitation of industry lagged on such a scale that by the spring of 1921 it seemed to be quite hopeless. We had to have a huge army, and it was built up to several millions. Because of the dislocation of transport, it was very hard to demobilise it quickly in the winter. We did it only by a supreme effort.
That was the situation we faced. Was there any other way out but to cut food appropriations to the limit, taking 240 million poods of grain instead of 423 million? That is the least we must collect with a medium harvest, if we are to get by. If we are to have more, we must give peasant farming an opportunity to revive. This requires some measures, and the best one, of course, would be to restore large-scale industry. The best and the only economically correct measure would be to increase industrial output and give the peasant more of the things he needs, not only cotton goods for the farmer and his family, but also badly needed machines and implements, even if they are of the simplest kind. But the metal industry was in the same state as the textile industry. That was the situation we faced. We failed to restore industry after the Ninth Congress because we were hit by a year of war, fuel shortage, lack of transport facilities, and the prostration of peasant farming. What can be done to give the utmost assistance to peasant farming? Only a reduction of food appropriations and their conversion into a tax of 240 million poods, given a medium harvest, and even less, if the harvest is bad. The peasant must be sure that after paying a certain amount, fixed at the minimum level, he will be absolutely free to grow as much as he can and use the rest of his products to get what he needs and improve his farm not only with the help of industry, which would be the best and most rational way, but would take more resources than we now command. The tax is fixed at the minimum, and its enforcement in the localities will stimulate small industry, for we cannot set large-scale industry to rights as soon as we should like. This has been proved by the Ivanovo-Voznesensk programme, which yielded the largest portion of what we had planned for. We must wait another year until fuel stocks are large enough to ensure the operation of all the factories. We shall be lucky to do it in a year, or even two. Can we assure the peasant of supplies? We can, if the harvest turns out to be a good one.
When the question of the tax in kind was being decided at the Party Congress the delegates were given a pamphlet by Comrade Popov, Director of our Central Statistical Board, on grain output in Russia. An enlarged edition will be published within a few days, and all of you should read it. It gives an idea of grain production, with the figures calculated from the returns of our census, which gave us the exact figures of the population and an estimate of the size of farms. It says that with a yield of 40 poods per dessiatine, peasant farming on Soviet Russia’s present area could provide 500 million poods of surplus grain that would cover the 350 million poods required by the urban population and leave us a fund for foreign trade and the improvement of peasant farming. The harvest was so bad that the yield was no more than an average of twenty-eight poods per dessiatine. This produced a deficit. If we accept the statisticians’ figure of requirements at eighteen poods per head, we must subtract three poods per head and oblige every peasant to go on short rations in order to keep the army and the industrial workers on half-rations. In that situation, we could do nothing but reduce the surplus appropriations to a minimum and convert them into a tax. We must concentrate on improving small peasant farming. We had no cotton goods, machines or other goods produced by large factories to give the peasant farmers, but it is a problem requiring urgent solution, and we have to solve it with the aid of small industry. We should have some results from the new measure this very first year.
Now, why is peasant farming the focus? Because it alone can give us the food and the fuel we need. If the working class, as the ruling class exercising its dictatorship, wants to run the economy properly, it must say: the crisis of peasant farming is the weakest spot. It must be remedied, and another start made on the revival of large-scale industry, 90 that in Ivanovo-Voznesensk district, for instance, all 70 factories—and not just 22—are running again. These large factories will then satisfy national demand, and the working class will deliver the goods to the peasants in exchange for farm produce, instead of taking it in the form of a tax. That is the transition we are making, and the price is short rations all round, if we are to save those who alone can keep what is left of industry and the railways going, and the army in the field to fight off the whiteguards.
Our grain appropriations-were maligned by the Mensheviks, who said that the Soviet power had given the population nothing but grain appropriations, want and destruction. They gloated over the fact that after the partial restoration of peace, after the end of the Civil War, the swift rehabilitation of our industry had proved to be impossible. But even the richest countries will take years to get their industry going full blast again. Even a rich country like France will take a long time to revive her industry, and she did not suffer as much from the war as we did, because only a small part of her territory was devastated. The astonishing thing is that in the first year of a partial peace we were able to start 22 factories out of 70 in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, and to produce 117 million arshins of cotton goods out of an anticipated 150 million. The grain appropriations had once been inevitable, but now we have had to change our food policy: we have had to switch from the surplus appropriation system to the tax. This will undoubtedly improve the peasant’s condition, and give him an assurance and a sense of certainty that he will be free to exchange all his available grain surplus at least for local handicraft wares. This explains why the Soviet government must conduct an economic policy on these lines.
Now, in conclusion, let me explain how this policy can be reconciled with the communist standpoint and how it has come about that the communist Soviet power is promoting a free market. Is it good from the standpoint of communism? To answer this question we must make a careful examination of the changes that have taken place in peasant farming. First, we witnessed the assault of the whole of the peasantry on the rule of the landowners, who were fought both by the poor peasants and the kulaks, although, of course, their motives were different: the kulaks wanted to take the land away from the landowners to develop their own farms. That was when it became clear that the kulaks and the poor peasants had divergent interests and aims. In the Ukraine, this divergence of interests is still much more in evidence than it is over here. The poor peasants could derive very little direct benefit from the transfer of land from the landowners to themselves, because they had neither the materials nor the implements. We find the poor peasants organising to prevent the kulaks from seizing the land taken away from the landowners. The Soviet government helped the Poor Peasants’ Committees that sprang up in Russia and in the Ukraine.[2] As a result, the middle peasants have become the predominant element in the rural areas. We know this from statistics, and everyone who lives in the country knows it from his own observations. The extremes of kulak and poor have been rounded off, and the majority of the population have come closer to the status of the middle peasant. If we want to raise the productivity of our peasant farming we must reckon chiefly with the middle peasant. The Communist Party has had to shape its policy accordingly.
Since the middle peasants now predominate in the rural areas, we must help them to improve their farming; moreover, we must make the same demands on them as we do on the workers. The principal question discussed at the last Party Congress was that of food propaganda: concentrate on the economic front, raise the productivity of labour and increase output. No progress is possible unless these tasks are fulfilled. If we say this to the worker, we must say as much to the peasant, but will demand in return that, after paying the tax, he should enlarge his farm, in the knowledge that no more will be exacted from him and that he will be free to use the whole of his surplus to develop his farm. Consequently, the change in policy in respect of the peasants is due to the change in their status. There are more middle peasants in the make-up of the rural areas and we must reckon with this, if we are to boost the productive forces.
Let me also remind you of the arguments I had with the “Left Communist” group in 1918, after the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk peace.[3] Those who were in the Party at the time will remember that some Communists feared that the conclusion of the Brest Peace would disrupt all communist policy. In the course of the argument with these comrades I said, among other things: State capitalism is nothing to fear in Russia; it would be a step forward. That sounded very strange: How could state capitalism be a step forward in a Soviet socialist republic? I replied: Take a close look at the actual economic relations in Russia. We find at least five different economic systems, or structures, which, from bottom to top, are: first, the patriarchal economy, when the peasant farms produce only for their own needs, or are in a nomadic or semi-nomadic state, and we happen to have any number of these; second, small commodity production, when goods are sold on the market; third, capitalist production, the emergence of capitalists, small private capital; fourth, state capitalism, and fifth, socialism. And if we do take a close look we shall find all these relations in Russia’s economic system even today. In no circumstances must we forget what we have occasion to see very often, namely, the socialist attitude of workers at state factories, who collect fuel, raw materials and food, or try to arrange a proper distribution of manufactured goods among the peasants and to deliver them with their own transport facilities. That is socialism. But alongside is small enterprise, which very often exists independently of it. Why can it do so? Because large-scale industry is not back on its feet, and socialist factories are getting perhaps only one-tenth of what they should be getting. In consequence, small enterprise remains independent of the socialist factories. The incredible havoc, the shortage of fuel, raw materials and transport facilities allow small enterprise to exist separately from socialism. I ask you: What is state capitalism in these circumstances? It is the amalgamation of small-scale production. Capital amalgamates small enterprises and grows out of them. It is no use closing our eyes to this fact. Of course, a free market means a growth of capitalism; there’s no getting away from the fact. And anyone who tries to do so will be deluding himself. Capitalism will emerge wherever there is small enterprise and free exchange. But are we to be afraid of it, if we have control of the factories, transport and foreign trade? Let me repeat what I said then: I believe it to be incontrovertible that we need have no fear of this capitalism. Concessions are that kind of capitalism.
We have been trying hard to conclude concession agreements, but, unfortunately, have not yet concluded a single one. Nevertheless, we are nearer to them now than we were several months ago, when we last discussed concessions. What are concessions from the standpoint of economic relations? They are state capitalism. The Soviet government concludes an agreement with a capitalist. Under it, the latter is provided with certain things: raw materials, mines, oilfields, minerals, or, as was the case in one of the last proposals, even a special factory (the ball-bearing project of a Swedish enterprise). The socialist state gives the capitalist its means of production such as factories, mines and materials. The capitalist operates as a contractor leasing socialist means of production, making a profit on his capital and delivering a part of his output to the socialist state.
Why is it that we badly need such an arrangement? Because it gives us, all at once, a greater volume of goods which we need but cannot produce ourselves. That is how we get state capitalism. Should it scare us? No, it should not, because it is up to us to determine the extent of the concessions. Take oil concessions. They will give us millions of poods of paraffin oil right away, and that is more than we produce ourselves. This is to our advantage, because in exchange for the paraffin oil—and not paper money—the peasant will give us his grain surplus, and we shall immediately be able to improve the situation in the whole country. That is why the capitalism that is bound to grow out of a free market holds no terrors for us. It will be the result of growing trade, the exchange of manufactured goods, even if produced by small industry, for agricultural produce.
Today’s law tells you that workers in some industries are to be issued a certain part of the articles manufactured in their factories in the form of a bonus in kind which they can exchange for grain. For example, provided they satisfy the requirements of the state, textile workers will receive a part of the textile goods they manufacture and will be able to exchange them for grain. This must be done to improve the condition of the workers and of the peasants as soon as possible. We cannot do this on a nation-wide scale, but it must be done at all costs. That is why we do not shut our eyes to the fact that a free market entails some development of capitalism, and we say: This capitalism will be under the control and surveillance of the state. We need have no fear of it because the workers’ state has taken possession of the factories and railways. It will help to stimulate the economic exchange of peasant produce for the manufactures of neighbouring craftsmen, who will satisfy some, if not all, of the peasants’ requirements in manufactured goods. The peasant economy will improve, and that is something we need to do desperately. Let small industry grow to some extent and let state capitalism develop—the Soviet power need have no fear of that. We must face the facts squarely and call a spade a spade, but we must also control and determine the limits of this development.
Concessions are nothing to be afraid of. There is nothing terrible about giving the concessionaires a few factories and retaining the bulk in our own hands. Of course, it would be absurd for the Soviet power to hand out the bulk of its property in the form of concessions. That would not be concessions, but a return to capitalism. There is nothing to fear in concessions so long as we retain possession of all the state enterprises and weigh up exactly and strictly the concessions we grant, and the terms and scale on which we grant them. Growing capitalism will be under control and supervision, while political power will remain in the hands of the working class and of the workers’ state. The capital which will exist in the form of concessions and the capital which will inevitably grow through the medium of the co-operatives and a free market, have no terrors for us. We must try to develop and improve the condition of the peasantry, and make a great effort to have this benefit the working class. We shall be able to do all that can be done to improve peasant farming and develop local trade more quickly with concessions than without them, while planning our national economy for a much faster rehabilitation of large-scale socialist industry. We shall be able to do this more quickly with the help of a rested and recuperated peasant economy than with the absolutely poverty-stricken peasant farming we have had up to now.
That is what I have to say on the communist appreciation of this policy, on why it was necessary, and why, if properly applied, it will bring improvement immediately, or, at all events, more quickly than if it had not been applied.

 The meeting was called by the Moscow Party Committee to explain the decisions of the Tenth Party Congress. It took place at Trade Union House, and was also attended by the Moscow Bolsheviks who had taken part in liquidating the Kronstadt counter-revolutionary mutiny, and the volost activists working among Moscow Gubernia peasant women. The report on the tax in kind was given by Lenin.
[2] The Poor Peasants’ Committees were set up under the June 11, 1918 decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, “On the Organisation and Supply of Poor Peasants”. They were to take stock of the food stored on peasant farms; to uncover surplus food on kulak farms, and to help the Soviet food supply bodies in requisitioning such surpluses and distributing them among the poor peasants. They were also to distribute farming machines, manufactured goods, etc. The committees actually became organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the villages. Their activity embraced all spheres of work and signified the further development of the socialist revolution in the countryside. At the end of 1918, after they had fulfilled their tasks, the committees were merged with volost and village Soviets.
In the Ukraine, they existed from 1920 to 1933, uniting land starved and landless peasants.
[3] The Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Soviet Russia and the powers of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey) was signed in Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918, and ratified by the Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on March 15. The terms of the treaty were extremely onerous for Soviet Russia: Germany and Austria-Hungary secured almost complete control over Poland, nearly the whole of the Baltic area, and a part of Byelorussia; the Ukraine seceded from Soviet Russia and became a German dependency; the cities of Kars, Batum and Ardagan were ceded to Turkey. In August 1918, Germany made Soviet Russia sign a supplementary treaty and a financial agreement whose terms were even more onerous.[See also Glossary Entry on the Treaty]

      Comrades, the concessions question has, rather unexpectedly,
      brought out some differences among us, for it appeared to have
      been finally settled in principle as long ago as the autumn of
      last year, and when the Council of People’s Commissars
      issued its concessions decree on November 23, there was no sign
      of protest, or of any disagreement, in Party circles, among the
      responsible workers, at any rate. You are, of course, aware that
      the Party Congress had to take a special decision confirming the
      concessions decree and specifically extending it to cover any
      concessions in Baku and Grozny.[2] This had to be done
      at the Party Congress to prevent any vacillation on policy in
      the Central Committee, whose division on this very question has
      to some extent proved to be quite out of line with earlier
      groupings, but which is largely connected with Baku. Some Baku
      comrades resented the idea that Baku too—or, perhaps,
      specifically—is to have concessions, and that it is
      desirable to lease out a major part of its oilfields. Their
      arguments were highly diverse, and ranged from references to
      their own "exploration", which could be done without any
      foreigners, to assertions that the old workers, who spent a
      lifetime fighting the capitalists, refuse to be saddled with
      their yoke once again, etc.

      I am not going to say offhand how much of these arguments was
      based on general principles and how much on Baku "patriotism"
      and localism. Let me say for my part that I have opposed this
      view most vigorously in the belief that if we do not manage to
      conduct a concessions policy and attract foreign capital to our
      concessions, we can hardly consider any serious practical
      measures to improve our economic position. We cannot seriously
      entertain the idea of an immediate improvement of the economic
      situation, unless we operate a policy of concessions, unless we
      discard our prejudices, our local patriotism, discard to some
      extent our craft patriotism, and to some extent the idea that we
      can do our own "exploring". We must be prepared for
      inconveniences, hardships and sacrifices; we must be ready to
      break our habits and possibly our addictions as well, for the
      sole purpose of working a marked change and improvement in the
      economic state of the key industries. This must be done at all
      costs.

      The Party Congress concentrated on the policy in respect of the
      peasants and on the tax in kind, which has, in general, a high
      legislative priority and is, in particular, central to the
      Party’s political efforts. In the context of both these
      issues, we have become aware that we are unable to boost
      productivity in large-scale industry as swiftly as the
      satisfaction of peasant needs demands, without the makeshifts of
      unrestricted trade and free production. These are the two
      crutches we must now use to move on, for, otherwise, as everyone
      in his right mind will see, we shall be unable to keep abreast
      of developments. After all, the situation is worsening, if only
      because the floating this spring has been largely hampered by
      various factors, chiefly the weather. There is a looming fuel
      crisis. The spring also holds out the threat of another crop
      failure, again because of the weather; this is liable to create
      a fodder shortage, which may, in its turn, still further reduce
      the fuel supply. If on top of this we happen to have a drought,
      the crisis threatens to be truly exceptional. We must understand
      that in these conditions what the Programme says—chiefly
      about the great need to increase the food supply—is not
      intended Ior admiration or for a show of great love for various
      resolutions (which the Communists have been doing with great
      zeal), but as a call to increase the quantity of foodstuffs at
      any cost. That is something we cannot do without the help of
      foreign capital. This should be plain to everyone who takes a
      realistic view of things. That is why the concessions question
      became important enough to be dealt with by the Party
      Congress.

      After a short debate, the Council of People’s Commissars
      adopted the basic principles of concessions agreements.[3] I shall now read them and underscore
      those which are of especial importance or have given rise to
      disagreements. We cannot seriously entertain the idea of
      economic development unless all members of the Party, specially
      the leaders of the trade union movement, that is, of the
      organised masses of the proletariat—its organised
      majority—understand the present situation and draw the
      appropriate conclusions. I shall read out the basic principles
      of the concessions agreement one by one, as they were adopted by
      the Council of People’s Commissars. Let me add that we
      have not yet concluded a single concessions agreement. We have
      already given expression to our disagreements of
      principle—we are past masters at that sort of
      thing—but have not yet secured any concessions. I suppose
      this will make some people happy, which is unfortunate, because
      if we fail to attract capital to our concessions, we shall
      merely prove that we are poor businessmen. But then, of course,
      the Communists can always have a field day with resolutions,
      filling up all the stocks of paper that we have. Here is Point
      One:

      "1.  The concessionaire shall improve the condition of the
      workers employed at the concession enterprises (as compared with
      that of other workers employed at similar enterprises in the
      area) up to the average standard abroad."

      We have inserted this basic provision in the agreement to bring
      out the gist of the matter at once for our Communists and chiefs
      of economic agencies. What is the most important aspect of any
      concession? It is, of course, an increase in the quantity of
      goods. That is self-evident. But what is also highly—if
      not much more—important is that we can secure an immediate
      improvement in the condition of the workers employed at the oil
      concession enterprises. These provisions of the concession
      agreement were adopted after several discussions, in particular,
      on the basis of the talks the plenipotentiaries of the
      R.S.F.S.R., specifically Comrade Krasin, have had with some of
      the financial magnates of modern imperialism. Let me
      say—and you are of course all aware of this—that the
      great majority of our Communists have a book knowledge of
      capitalism and finance capital; they may even have written a
      pamphlet or two on the subject, but 99 per cent of them
      don’t know how to do business with financial magnates and,
      I’m afraid, will never learn.

      In that respect, Comrade Krasin has had some exceptional
      experience, for he has made a study of the practices and
      organisation of industry in Germany and Russia. We informed him
      of these terms, and he replied that they were, on the whole,
      acceptable. The concessionaire is above all duty bound to
      improve the condition of the workers. This very point was
      discussed by Krasin in his exploratory talks with an oil king,
      and the West-European capitalists were quite clear on the point
      that, the condition of the workers being what it is, it was
      absolutely impossible to expect greater productivity. The
      proviso that the concessionaire must improve the workers’
      condition is not a humanitarian but a purely business
      proposition. Point Two:

      "2.  Account shall be taken of the lower productivity of
      the Russian worker and provision made for the possibility of a
      revision of the Russian worker’s rate of labour
      productivity, depending on the improvement of his living
      conditions."

      We had to make this reservation to prevent a one-sided reading
      of the clause. All these provisions are rules and directives for
      any representatives of the Soviet power who may have to deal
      with the concessions, and are the basis on which the agreements
      are to be worked out. We have drafts of an oil agreement, an
      agreement on ball-bearing plants, a draft timber concession, and
      an agreement on Kamchatka, which is being aired for a long time
      but is not being implemented for various reasons. Point Two was
      required to prevent a literal reading of Point One. We must
      consider the fact that labour productivity will not rise until
      the workers’ condition improves. Refusal to consider this
      would be so unbusiness-like that the capitalist would not even
      bother to negotiate. Point Three:

      "3.  It shall be the duty of the concessionaire to supply
      the workers employed at the concession enterprises with the
      necessary means of subsistence from abroad, selling them to the
      workers at no higher than cost price plus a certain percentage
      for overhead expenses."

      There was a proposal to set the figure at 10 per cent, but it
      was discarded in the final discussion. The important thing here
      is that we stipulate the supply of the means of subsistence for
      the workers from abroad. We know that with the present state of
      peasant farming and the fuel problem we shall be unable, within
      the next few years, to effect a radical improvement in the
      workers’ condition, and, consequently, to increase labour
      productivity. It is, therefore, necessary for the concessionaire
      to include in the agreement a provision covering the supply of
      all the means of consumption from abroad, something he can
      easily do, and we already have the tentative consent of some
      capitalist sharks on this point. The concessionaires will accept
      these terms because they are extremely anxious to obtain the
      tremendously valuable raw materials. For them the supply of raw
      materials is a prime necessity. Whether these priority
      enterprises will be employing 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 workers,
      the concessionaires will have no trouble in obtaining the
      necessaries for the workers, considering the ties between modern
      syndicates and trusts, for very few capitalists today are not
      syndicated and trustified, and all large enterprises are based
      on monopoly, instead of the free market; consequently, they can
      always block supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs for other
      capitalists and obtain all they require under all manner of
      provisional agreements. These syndicates operate with hundreds
      of millions of dollars. They will have vast stocks of food at
      their disposal, and will, consequently, be able to obtain
      foodstuffs and other necessaries for several tens of thousands
      of workers, and transport them to Russia.

      They will not find it an economic problem at all. They will
      regard these enterprises as being on the priority
      list—they will make a profit of 100, if not 1,000, per
      cent—and supply them with food. I repeat, that will be no
      economic problem for them at all. We must put at the heart of
      our concessions policy the task of improving the condition of
      the workers at the enterprises of the first category, and then
      at the rest. Here is Point Four:

      "4.  It shall also be the duty of the concessionaire, in
      the event of a request on the part of the R.S.F.S.R. Government,
      to import another 50-100 per cent over and above the supplies he
      brings in for the workers employed at the concession
      enterprises, handing it over to the R.S.F.S.R. Govern-



      ment in return for a payment of similar size (cost plus a
      certain percentage for overhead expenses). The
      R.S.F.S.R. Government shall have the right to meet this payment
      with a part of the product extracted by the concessionaire (that
      is, to deduct it from its own share)."

      This stipulation was also accepted by the financial magnates in
      the exploratory talks because they put the concession
      enterprises on the priority list.

      They will be in a position to monopolise the marketing of the
      oil which they can obtain from us, and this is why they can
      supply foodstuffs not only to the workers employed at their
      enterprises but also a certain percentage over and above that. A
      comparison of this clause with Point One shows that the pivot of
      our concessions policy is improvement of the condition of the
      workers, initially of those employed at the concession
      enterprises, and then, to a somewhat lesser extent, of the other
      workers as well, with some of the consumer goods being obtained
      from abroad. Even if we had the wherewithal to pay for them, we
      ourselves are not in a position to purchase them in the
      international market. You may have the currency, say, gold, but
      you must bear in mind that there is no free market, for it is
      all, or nearly all, controlled by the syndicates, cartels and
      trusts, which are ruled by their imperialist profits. They will
      supply consumer goods only to workers of their own enterprises,
      and not for those of others, because the old
      capitalism—meaning the free market—is no longer
      there. That shows the essence of our concessions policy in the
      context of the present conditions of finance capital and the
      behemoth struggle between the trusts. The concessions policy is
      an alliance concluded by one side against another, and so long
      as we are not strong enough, we must play off their hostile
      rivalry, so as to hold out until the victory of the
      international revolution. They can assure the workers of their
      maintenance because it is no trouble at all for a large modern
      enterprise to supply an extra 20,000 or 30,000 workers. This
      would allow us to meet the expenditure with raw materials, say,
      oil. If we were able to pay for this additional quantity of
      necessaries for the workers with an additional quantity of
      timber or ore—our chief resources—we should be in a
      position to start by improving the condition of the workers
      employed at the concession enterprises and use what is left to
      improve, to a lesser extent, the condition of other
      workers. Point Five:

      "5.  It shall be the duty of the concessionaire to abide by
      the laws of the R.S.F.S.R., in particular, those relating to
      working conditions, terms of payment, etc.; and enter into
      agreements with the trade unions (in the event of the
      concessionaire’s demand we are prepared to add that under
      such agreements both parties shall be bound by the average norm
      of American or West-European workers)."

      This reservation is being made to remove any fears the
      capitalists may have in respect of our trade unions. We say that
      agreements must be entered into with our trade unions because
      their participation is stipulated by all the relevant
      laws—all essential laws stipulate the participation of
      trade unions which enjoy statutory status in accordance with
      socialist principles. The well-informed capitalist is aware that
      the trade unions are guided by Communist groups and, through
      them, by the Party, and he would be highly suspicious if we told
      him that he would have to enter into agreements with our trade
      unions, because he would be apprehensive of all sorts of
      absurdities on the part of these Communists, and would, in
      consequence, make the most incredible demands. Such fears are
      quite natural from the capitalist standpoint. That is why we
      must say that we favour a business agreement—otherwise
      there is nothing to discuss. That is why we say we are prepared
      to make that addendum. We are prepared to accept, for ourselves
      and our trade unions, a norm equal to the average American or
      West European labour norm. Otherwise, I repeat, there can be no
      question at all of any agreement adapted to capitalist
      relations. Point Six:

      "6.  It shall be the duty of the concessionaire strictly to
      observe the scientific and technical regulations in conformity
      with Russian and foreign legislation (details to be stated in
      each agreement)."

      This point is to be elaborated in the agreement in particular
      detail. The oil agreement, for instance, contains 10 clauses
      setting forth and describing detailed scientific
      regulations. Inability to attend to the proper scientific
      exploitation of labour-power, as of the land, is the hallmark of
      capitalist economic operations. Scientific and technical
      regulations are a way of overcoming it. Incorrect or
      insufficiently correct working of oilfields is known to result
      in their flooding. It is clearly very important for us to obtain
      the technical equipment. You will recall that The Plan for
      the Electrification of Russia estimated just how much of
      that equipment we needed. I do not remember the exact figure,
      but the overall expenditures for electrification were estimated
      at 17,000 million gold rubles, with the priority projects taking
      about a decade to fulfil. We expect to cover up to 11,000
      million from our own resources—gold and
      exports—which leaves 6,000 million outstanding. The
      authors of the plan say that we shall either have to borrow or
      lease. The deficit has to be made good. The plan was worked out
      for the whole Republic by the best brains and provides for a
      balanced development of all branches of industry. The chief
      problem is fuel and its most economic, rational and efficient
      use in the key industries. We should be unable to solve it if we
      did not have any concessions or credit facilities. These
      conditions may suddenly turn out to be non-existent, and that
      at the most welcome moment, say, after a large
      strike, like the one now on in Britain, or the one which was
      recently defeated in Germany.[4] But a successful
      strike and a successful revolution will come in the wake of an
      unsuccessful one, and we shall then find ourselves with
      socialist, instead of capitalist, relations.

      Stoppages in oil extraction may prove to be disastrous. The
      capitalists have failed to reach Baku’s 1905 rate. It
      turns out that the danger of flooding is also reckoned with
      abroad, for instance, in California and Rumania. Insufficient
      pump-off of water results in ever greater flooding.

      There are detailed regulations on this score in Russian and
      foreign legislation. When dealing with this matter in Baku, we
      sought the opinion of our experts on Rumanian and Californian
      legislation. If we are to safeguard our oil resources, we must
      see that the scientific and technical regulations are
      observed. If we are to lease, say, a tract of forest we must see
      that the lumbering is done in a proper manner. If it should be
      an oil lease, we must stipulate measures to prevent flooding. In
      each case, there must be observance of scientific and technical
      regulations and rational exploitation. Where are the regulations
      to come from? They are to be taken from Russian and foreign
      legislation, and this will allay any suspicions that they are
      our own invention, in which case no capitalist will bother to
      negotiate with us. We intend to take what there is in Russian
      and foreign legislation. If we take the best of what there is in
      Russian and any foreign legislation, we shall have a basis to
      guarantee the standards attained by the leading
      capitalists. These are well-known business standards borrowed
      from capitalist practice, and not a Communist flight of fancy
      which the capitalists fear most of all. We guarantee that none
      of the terms, aspects or clauses of our concession agreement
      will go beyond the framework of capitalist legislation. We must
      never lose sight of this key proposition. We must take
      capitalist relationships as a basis to show that the capitalists
      will find these terms acceptable and profitable, but we, for our
      part, must turn them to good advantage. Otherwise, it is a waste
      of time to talk about concessions. But to return to what is
      recognised in capitalist legislation. Advanced capitalism is
      known to be superior to our own industry in technical
      organisation and improvements. For that reason, we are not
      confining ourselves to Russian legislation, and in the case of
      oil we have started to borrow from Russian, Rumanian and
      Californian legislation. We are entitled to take any law, which
      will dispel any suspicions of arbitrariness or whim. That will
      be easily understood by the modern advanced capitalist and
      financial magnate, in fact, finance capital as a whole, for our
      terms and standards will conform to those prevalent abroad, and
      we are proposing them with an eye to the business practices of
      capitalism. In this case, we are not indulging in any flights of
      fancy, but are setting ourselves the practical goal of improving
      our industry and raising it to the levels of modern advanced
      capitalism. Anyone who has an idea of the state of our industry
      will see that this will be a tremendous improvement. If we were
      to do this even in respect of a certain section of our industry,
      say, one-tenth of it, we should still be taking a great step
      forward, which would be feasible for them, and highly desirable
      for us. Point Seven:

      "7.  A rule similar to that set forth in Point Four shall
      also apply to the equipment imported by the concessionaire from
      abroad."

      Point Four says that the concessionaire shall be bound, in the
      event the clause is written into the agreement, to import a
      certain quantity of goods for sale, against a special payment,
      over and above what he imports for his own operations. If the
      capitalist should import improved types of bores and tools for
      himself, we shall be entitled to demand that he import, say, an
      extra 25 per cent for us, over and above the bores he imports
      for himself, the payment arrangements to be the same as those
      specified in Point Four, that is, cost plus a definite
      percentage for overhead expenses.

      The future is very bright, but we should never confuse our
      activity in these two planes: on the one hand, there is the
      agitation which brings nearer this future, and on the other, the
      ability now to adapt ourselves to and exist in the capitalist
      encirclement. If we fail to do that we might find ourselves in
      the position of one who has had his chance but was not alert
      enough to act in time. We must manage, by taking advantage of
      the peculiarities of the capitalist world and the capitalist
      avidity for raw materials, to derive all the benefits that would
      help us to consolidate our economic positions among the
      capitalists, strange as that may sound. The task seems to be an
      odd one: How can a socialist republic improve its positions with
      capitalist support? We had an instance of this during the
      war. We did not win the war because we were stronger, but
      because, while being weaker, we played off the enmity between
      the capitalist states. Either we now succeed in playing off the
      rivalry between the trusts, or we shall find ourselves unadapted
      to capitalist conditions and unable to exist in the capitalist
      encirclement. Point Eight:

      "8.  A special clause in each agreement shall regulate the
      question of payment to the workers employed at the concession
      enterprises of wages in foreign currency special coupons, Soviet
      currency, etc."

      You see that in this case we are prepared to accept payment in
      any currency, whether foreign or Soviet, or in coupons, and show
      goodwill by being prepared to consider any of the
      businessmen’s proposals. Of the concrete proposals there
      is the one Vanderlip made to our representatives. He said: "I
      should like to pay the workers an average wage of, say, a dollar
      and a half a day. On my concession territory I would set up
      stores carrying all the goods the workers may need, and these
      will be available to those who receive special coupons; these
      coupons will be issued only to workers who are employed at my
      concession enterprises." Whether things work out as he says,
      remains to be seen, but we find this acceptable in principle. A
      great many difficulties naturally arise. It is, of course, no
      easy task to harmonise a concession geared to capitalist
      production with the Soviet standpoint, and every effort of that
      kind is, as I have said, a continuation of the struggle between
      capitalism and socialism. This struggle has assumed new forms,
      but it remains a struggle nonetheless. Every concessionaire
      remains a capitalist, and he will try to trip up the Soviet
      power, while we, for our part, must try to make use of his
      rapacity. We say: "We shall not grudge him even 150 per cent in
      profits, provided the condition of our workers is improved."
      That is the pivot of the struggle. In this sphere, of course,
      you need to be even more skilled than in struggling for the
      conclusion of a peace treaty. The capitalist powers behind the
      scenes take part in the struggle for the conclusion of any peace
      treaty. There was a foreign power pulling the strings behind
      each of the countries with whom we have signed a peace
      treaty—Latvia, Finland and Poland. We had to conclude
      these treaties in such a way that, on the one hand, they allowed
      the bourgeois republics to exist, and on the other, they secured
      advantages for the Soviet power from the standpoint of world
      diplomacy. Every peace treaty with a capitalist power is a
      record of certain war clauses. In much the same way, each clause
      of a concession agreement records some aspect of a war, and we
      should organise things in such a way as to safeguard our own
      interests in that war. This can be done because the capitalist
      will be receiving big profits from the concession enterprise,
      while we shall be obtaining some improvement in the condition of
      our workers, and some increase in the quantity of goods from our
      share in the output. If the wages should be paid in foreign
      currency, this will give rise to a number of complex problems:
      how is this currency to be exchanged for Soviet currency? how
      are we to fight speculation? etc. We have accepted the idea that
      we have an answer to all these problems, and need not fear any
      of them. This point tells the capitalists that they are free to
      invent anything they like. It makes no difference to us whether
      you bring in the goods and sell them for special coupons, on
      special terms, or only upon presentation of special certificates
      issued personally to workers employed at the concession. We
      shall manage to adapt ourselves to any terms in such a way as to
      fight the capitalists on these terms and secure a certain
      improvement in the condition of our workers. This is the task we
      have set ourselves. We can’t tell how it will be resolved
      in a concession agreement, for we can’t very well offer
      the same terms of payment in some place like Kamchatka as over
      here or in Baku. If the concession should be located in the
      Donets Basin, the forms of payment cannot conceivably be the
      same as for one in the far North. We are not holding down the
      capitalists to some specific form of payment. Every clause of
      the agreement will contain an element of struggle between
      capitalists and socialists. We are not afraid of this struggle,
      and are sure that we shall manage to derive every possible
      benefit from the concessions. Point Nine:

      "9.  The concessionaire shall be free to make his own terms
      of employment, living conditions and remuneration with foreign
      skilled workers and employees.

      "The trade unions shall not have the right to demand application
      of Russian pay rates or of Russian rules of employment to that
      category of workers."

      We believed Point Nine to be absolutely indispensable because it
      would be quite absurd to expect the capitalists to trust the
      Communists. This is clearly stated both from the standpoint of
      principle and especially from the businessman’s
      standpoint. For if we insisted on trade union endorsement of
      these terms of employment, if we told the capitalists that we
      accepted any foreign technician or specialist but only within
      the framework of the Labour Code of the R.S.F.S.R., it would be
      too much to expect any of the latter to accept, and the demand
      would be a mere formality. It could be said that the government
      says one thing and the trade unions another, because they are
      two distinct bodies, thereby leaving a legal loophole. But this
      was not written for lawyers but for Communists, and it was done
      on the basis of the decisions of the Tenth Party Congress on how
      to conduct the concessions policy. All of our writings, to which
      people in Europe have access, say that the concessions policy is
      being directed by the Communist Party, which is the ruling
      party. This has been rendered into all foreign languages, and
      there is no catch in it. We would not be in a position to
      consider any concessions policy at all, if we, being the
      political leadership, failed to say that in this case we were
      unable and unwilling to make use of our influence with the trade
      unions. There is no sense in teaching communism to the
      capitalists. We are fine Communists, but we are not going to
      usher in the communist order through concessions. After all, a
      concession is an agreement with a capitalist power. We would
      surely have committed to a lunatic asylum any Communist who
      decided to go and conclude a treaty with a capitalist power on
      the basis of communist principles. We would tell him that he was
      a fine Communist in his way but a complete flop as a diplomatist
      in a capitalist country. The Communist who tried to demonstrate
      his communism in respect of the concessions policy in an
      agreement would be just as near to being committed to a lunatic
      asylum. What you need to have is a good idea of capitalist
      trade, and if you haven’t got it, you’re no
      good. Either don’t go in for concessions at all, or make
      an effort to understand that we must try to use these capitalist
      conditions in our own interest, by allowing the foreign
      technicians and workers complete freedom. That we shall not
      insist on any restrictions in this sphere goes without
      saying.

      Section Three of Point Nine, which follows, does contain a
      restriction:

      "The proportion of foreign workers and employees to Russians,
      both in total and within the several categories, shall be agreed
      upon by the parties in concluding each concession agreement
      separately."

      We cannot, of course, object to the importation of foreign
      workers into areas which we are unable to supply with Russian
      workers, as, for instance, in the Kamchatka timber industry. In
      the case of, say, the mining industry, where there is a lack of
      drinking water or foodstuffs, and where the capitalists would
      wish to build, we shall also allow them to bring in the greater
      part. On the other hand, where Russian workers are available, we
      stipulate a proportion to give our workers a chance, a) to
      learn, and b) to improve their condition. After all, we do want
      our workers to benefit from an improvement of our enterprises
      according to the last word in capitalist technology. The
      capitalists have not raised any objections in principle to any
      of these provisions. And here is Point Ten, the last one:

      "10.  The concessionaire may, by agreement with the
      government organs of the R.S.F.S.R., be granted the right to
      invite highly skilled specialists from among Russian citizens,
      the terms of employment being agreed with central government
      bodies in each case."

      Plainly, we cannot guarantee full scope in this respect, as we
      can in respect of foreign technicians and workers. In the latter
      case, we refrain from interfering, and they are left entirely
      within the framework of capitalist relations. We promise no such
      scope for our specialists and technicians, for we cannot have
      our best men working at the concession enterprises. We have no
      desire to shut off all access for them to that area, but there
      must be supervision over the performance of the agreement from
      above and from below the workers, members of the Communist
      Party, who will be employed at these enterprises, must supervise
      the performance of the terms of the agreement, both in respect
      of their technical training and observance of our laws. There
      were no objections in principle on this point in the exploratory
      talks with some of the magnates of modern capitalism.

      All these points have been confirmed by the Council of
      People’s Commissars, and I hope they give you a clear
      picture of the concessions policy we intend to conduct.

      Each concession will undoubtedly be a new kind of war—an
      economic war—the fight carried into another plane. This
      calls for adaptation, but one that is in line with the Party
      Congress. If we are to attain our goal, we must have a respite
      and must be prepared to make sacrifices and endure
      hardships. Our goal is: in the capitalist encirclement to make
      use of the greed of the capitalists for profit and the rivalry
      between the trusts, so as to create conditions for the existence
      of the socialist republic, which cannot exist without having
      ties with the rest of the world, and must, in the present
      circumstances, adjust its existence to capitalist
      relations. There is the question of actual terms. For oil
      agreements, they are as follows: from one-quarter to one-third
      of the whole of Grozny and of the whole of Baku. We have worked
      out our share of the output: we shall be retaining from 30 to 40
      per cent of the oil extracted. We have inserted a commitment to
      increase output within a certain period to, say, 100 million,
      and another commitment to extend the oil pipeline from Grozny
      and Petrovsk to Moscow. Whether we shall have to make any extra
      payments is to be stipulated in each agreement. But we should be
      quite clear on the type of agreement concluded in these
      conditions. The important thing, from the trade union
      standpoint, is for the Party leadership to see the specific
      features of this policy and set themselves the task of securing
      such concessions at any cost, in pursuance of the decisions of
      the Party Congress, in the context of tasks facing the socialist
      system in the capitalist encirclement. Every concession will be
      a gain and an immediate improvement in the condition of a
      section of the workers and peasants. The latter will stand to
      gain because each concession will mean the production of
      additional goods, which we are unable to produce ourselves, and
      which we shall be exchanging for their products, instead of
      taking them through a tax.

      This is a very difficult operation, especially for the organs of
      the Soviet power. With this point as pivotal we must set about
      to secure concessions, overriding the prejudices, inertia,
      ingrained customs, and the inconvenience of some workers having
      a bigger pay packet than the others. We could invent any number
      of excuses, in the way of objections and inconveniences, to
      frustrate any practical improvement, and that is what the
      foreign capitalists are really banking on. I know of no other
      point that has drawn so many objections from the most
      intelligent writers in the Russian whiteguard press, the men the
      Kronstadt events proved to be head and shoulders above Martov
      and Chernov. They are very well aware that if we fail to improve
      the condition of our workers and peasants because of our
      prejudices, we shall multiply our difficulties and altogether
      undermine the prestige of the Soviet power. You know that we
      must have that improvement at all costs. We shall not grudge the
      foreign capitalist even a 2,000 per cent profit, provided we
      improve the condition of the workers and peasants. It is
      imperative that we do it. 

Endnotes

[1] The meeting was
      held on April 11, 1921, to discuss the concessions question,
      because some leading trade unionists were hesitant, while
      A. G. Shlyapnikov and D. B. Ryazanov carried on demagogic
      propaganda against the idea of concessions.

      Lenin gave a report on the issue, argued against
      Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s statements in the
      debate and made notes of all the arguments, which he used in his
      summing-up speech. He defined the essence of the concessions
      policy and its importance for the Soviet state.

[2]The reference is to
      the resolution of the Tenth Party Congress, "The Soviet Republic
      in Capitalist Encirclement". See K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiakh
      . . . (The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of
      Congresses, Conferences and C.C. Plenary Meetings,
      Part 1, 1954, pp. 566-67).

[3] On February 1,
      1921, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted a decree
      on oil concessions in Baku and Grozny, which made it necessary
      to work out the basic principles of concessions
      agreements. A. I. Rykov, Chairman of the Supreme Economic
      Council, was assigned to draft the project. As the work dragged
      out, Lenin studied the relevant material and in late March came
      out with a project, "The Basic Principles of Concessions
      Agreements". He made some additions and corrections (the
      document is at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
      Marxism-Leninism under the C.C., C.P.S.U.) in the original (see
      Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 148), and his draft project was
      adopted as the basis of the March 29 resolution of the Council
      of People’s Commissars. 

[4]In March 1921, the
      workers of Mansfeld, led by Communists, went on strike against
      an order setting up police patrols at plants and factories in
      Central Germany. In some places there were armed clashes with
      the police. The workers of Berlin, Hamburg and several other
      towns expressed their solidarity with the heroic strikers, but
      the Communist Party of Germany failed to unite the working-class
      forces against the bourgeoisie because of the treacherous
      behaviour of Paul Levi and other opportunists in the party
      leadership. 

      The miners’ strike in Britain lasted from April until June
      1921, in protest of the mineowners’ intention to cut
      wages. More than a million workers participated in the strike,
      with all the miners taking part. The miners’ federation
      called on the executive committees of the transport and railway
      unions to strike in solidarity, but their reformist leaders were
      secretly negotiating with the government and the mineowners for
      a compromise to break up the strike. The miners had to return to
      work after a heroic three-month struggle.

      I send my warmest greetings to the Soviet Republics of the
      Caucasus, and should like to express the hope that their close
      alliance will servo as a model of national peace, unprecedented
      under the bourgeoisie and impossible under the capitalist
      system.

      But important as national peace among the workers and peasants
      of the Caucasian nationalities is, the maintenance and
      development of the Soviet power, as the transition to socialism,
      are even more important. The task is difficult, but fully
      feasible. The most important thing for its successful fulfilment
      is that the Communists of the Transcaucasus should be fully
      alive to the singularity of their position, and of the position
      of their Republics, as distinct from the position and conditions
      of the R.S.F.S.R.; that they should appreciate the need to
      refrain from copying our tactics, but thoughtfully vary them in
      adaptation to the differing concrete conditions.

      The Soviet Republic or Russia had no outside political or
      military assistance. On the contrary, for years and years it
      fought the Entente military invasions and blockade.

      The Soviet Republics of the Caucasus have had political and some
      military assistance from the! R.S,F.S.R. This alone has made a
      vast difference.

      Second, there is now no cause to fear any Entente invasion or
      military assistance to the Georgian, Azerbaijan, Armenian,
      Daghestan and mountaineer whiteguards. The Entente “burnt
      their fingers” in Russia! and that will probably compel
      them to be more cautious for some time.

      Third, the Caucasian Republics have an even more pronounced
      peasant character than Russia.

      Fourth, Russia has been, and to a considerable extent still is,
      economically isolated from the advanced capitalist
      countries. The Caucasus is in a position to start trading and
      “living together” with the capitalist West sooner
      and with greater ease.

      These are not all the differences, but they are sufficient to
      demonstrate the need for different tactics.

      You will need to practise more moderation and caution, and show
      more readiness to make concessions to the petty bourgeoisie, the
      intelligentsia, and particularly the peasantry. You must make
      the swiftest, most intense and all possible economic use of the
      capitalist West through a policy of concessions and trade. Oil,
      manganese, coal (Tkvarcheli mines) and copper are some of your
      immense mineral resources. You have every possibility to develop
      an extensive policy of concessions and trade with foreign
      countries.

      This must be done on a wide scale, with firmness, skill and
      circumspection, and it must be utilised to the utmost for
      improving the condition of the workers and peasants, and for
      enlisting the intelligentsia in the work of economic
      construction. Through trade with Italy, America and other
      countries, you must exert every effort to develop the productive
      forces of your rich land, your water resources and irrigation
      which is especially important as a means of advancing
      agriculture and livestock farming.

      What the Republics of the Caucasus can and must do, as distinct
      from the R,S.F.S.R., is to effect a slower, more cautious and
      more systematic transition to socialism. That is what you must
      understand, and what you must be able to carry out, as distinct
      from our own tactics.

      We fought to make the first breach in the wall of world
      capitalism. The breach has been made. We have maintained our
      positions in a fierce and superhuman war against the Whites, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, who were supported
      by the Entente countries, their blockade and military
      assistance.

      You, Comrades Communists of the Caucasus, have no need to force
      a breach. You must take advantage of the favourable
      international situation in 1921, and learn to build the new with
      greater caution and more method. In 1921, Europe and the world
      are not what they were in 1917 and 1918.

      Do not copy our tactics, but analyse the reasons for their
      peculiar features, the conditions that gave rise to them, and
      their results; go beyond the letter, and apply the spirit, the
      essence and the lessons of the 1917-21 experience. You must make
      trade with the capitalist countries your economic foundation
      right away. The cost should be no object even if it means
      letting them have tens of millions’ worth of valuable
      minerals.

      You must make immediate efforts to improve the condition of the
      peasants and start on extensive electrification and irrigation
      projects. What you need most is irrigation, for more than
      anything else it will revive the area and regenerate it, bury
      the past and make the transition to socialism more certain.

      I hope you will pardon my slipshod style: 1 have had to write
      the letter at very short notice, so as to send it along with
      Comrade Myasnikov. Once again I send my best greetings and
      wishes to the workers and peasants of the Soviet Republics of
      the Caucasus.

      Comrades, I very much regret that I have been unable to go to
      Petrograd at your invitation. I send heartfelt greetings to the
      non-Party conference, and I welcome your work. The assistance of
      the non-Party masses and cooperation with them is of especial
      importance today, when the bourgeoisie of the world is
      conducting an incredible campaign of lies against Soviet Russia,
      in an effort to prevent us from concluding any trade agreements
      with foreign countries. The Kronstadt events have brought home
      to the workers and peasants the fact that any shift of power in
      Russia tends to favour the whiteguards; no wonder Milyukov and
      all intelligent leaders of the bourgeoisie welcomed the
      Kronstadt Soviets without the Bolsheviks" slogan.

      In conveying my greetings to the non-Party conference, I should
      like to wish you every success in your work, and ask you to pay
      special attention to the present need-in fact a constant need-of
      drawing more non-Party workers and peasants into economic
      construction. A regional economic centre has been set up in
      Petrograd. Let us intensify our effort. Local functionaries are
      being vested with broader powers and should show more
      initiative. The non-Party people should set to work, and let us
      have more and more men.
Greetings,

    
Lenin

[1] The conference
      (April 10-20, 1921) was attended by over 1,000 delegates from
      Petrograd factories and plants. It discussed the following
      quesitons: 1) The tasks of the working class and its
      participation in the economic construction of Soviet Russia; 2)
      Workers’ conditions in connection with the tasks of
      organising production; 3) Problems of food and workers’
      supply. The Mensheviks who got in as non-party workers did not
      succeed in disrupting the meeting because the mass of workers
      expressed a desire to work with the Communist Party.

      The delegates sent their greetings to Lenin and invited him to
      the meeting. Lenin’s reply was read out at the final
      sitting on April 20, 1921.

      Plan of Pamphlet:


To convey the meaning more precisely: The substitution of
  a taxthe appropriation system in view of the specific
  conditions and he general tasks of the present political
  situation.

The substitution of a tax for surplus-grain appropriation
  and agreement with the peasantry (or the tasks of a
  workers’ government in a peasant country) and the
  tasks of the working class in respect of the peasantry.



 The substitution of a tax for or the appropriation system
  in view of the present political situation.





      The substitution of a tax for the appropriation system, its
      significance in principle: from “War” Communism to a
      proper socialist foundation.

      The economic essence and foundation of socialism is neither
      appropriation nor tax, but exchange of the product of
      large-scale (“socialised”) industry for peasant
      produce.

      The appropriation system is not an “ideal”, but a
      sad and bitter necessity. The opposite view is a dangerous
      mistake.

      The appropriation system and the “apparatus”. We
      should have perished long ago but for the
      “apparatus”. Unless we wage a systematic and
      persevering struggle to improve it we shall perish before we
      manage to lay the foundation of socialism.

      The alliance of the workers and peasants = c’. and
      c’ of the Soviet power. “Necessary and
      adequate” condition for its stability.

      This alliance against Denikin & Co. is not the same as the
      alliance (the same one) in economic organisation.

      The first=bourgeois revolution.

    

      The second=socialist revolution.

      Transition from war to construction.

      Ninth Congress 1920 (cf. April 1918) versus Tenth Congress
      (March 1921).

      Switch from appropriation to regular commodity exchange.

      The tax is in principle compatible with a free market in grain
      and other products.

      Formal democracy versus the reality of class relations over the
      tax and other similar questions.

      Coercion + persuasion (in appropriation)-in the taxin "commodity
      exchange".

      How much "free trade" is thereto be? After paying the tax.

Scope for experiment, practice. Small trade . . . .
|| Tasks oflocal officials.|| Tasks of local authorities.

      Type of economic relations or the economic system before the
      proletarian revolution in a number of major
      countries=concentration at the top 

    

      unrestricted peasant trade at
      the
      bottom a species of state capitalism (cf. April 1918).

      “Stake” on the middle peasant? On the kulak?
      Restoration of bourgeois relationships?

      Levelling up of the rural areas

“the poor peasants” 

were given an equalitarian redistribution
were givenlandowners’ land
were given opportunity to take from the kulaks
were given extraordinary assistance by the
state

       

The pivot and touchstone will now be ’(is) an
      increase in products (of. Programme of the R.C.P.).b00 Inde(Hense): the “stake”
      on the middle peasant in agriculture.

      The industrious peasant as the "central figure" of our economic
      revival.

      Individual commodity exchange.

      Role of the collective farms: many stupid timings have been
      done. Prosecution for failure to implement the law and
      incompetence (three years).

      Is socialism to fear the "individualism" of the peasant and his
      "free trade"? No.

      Electrification: the yardstick. A long-range plan, but a plan
      and (ergo) a criterion. (Every plan is a yardstick, a criterion,
      a beacon, a landmark, etc.)

      If we have electrification within 10 to 20 years, there is
      nothing to fear from the individualism of the small farmer and
      his unrestricted trade in local exchange. If we have no
      electrification, a return to capitalism is inevitable in any
      case.

      The international situation is now favourable: a new
      equilibrium.


Their disintegration, our consolidation.
Entente versus Germany.
America versus Japan (and Great Britain).
America versus Europe.
The imperialist world versus "Asia".
(1/7)         (4/7)

(0.250 x 7=1.75) (a thousand million out of 1,750)[101]

      Ten or twenty years of regular relations with the peasantry and
      victory is assured on a world scale (even if there is delay in
      the proletarian revolutions, which are maturing); otherwise
      20-40 years of tormenting whiteguard terror.

Aut-aut. Tertium non clatur.(Either
      or. There is no third road—Editor.)

      NB:
“Agreement” with the peasantry? Constituent Assembly (overt or covert), voting, change of Constitution, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks + anarchists.
Co-operatives. Their economic and political (Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries) aspects.Ambiguity of the notion of “agreement”, particularly versus "dictatorship". 
Experience and lessons of Kronstadt (new feature in the political history of Soviet power). Uncompromising struggle  against Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, anarchists.

      “politics”?—Editor.)

      (1) the vanguard of the proletariat and its mass.

        it. “Despair”?|

      The pace is not what it should be (in war-time and peacetime
      construction).

      In April 1918 and in April 1920, we imagined transition from the
      war to peace-time construction to be a simple one on the same
      lines of policy.

      The transition is a complex one: relations with the peasantry
      are different, the pace is different, the situation is
      different.

      Demobilisation of the army.

      Banditry. (Devastation. Seven years of war.)

      Either a whiteguard reign of terror, or the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, its (relaxing) leadership.

      What is so terrible about the word
      “dictatorship”?

      NB:


The non-Party peasant as are a yardstick, a  criterion, a
  counsellor—and a slogan (= Socialist-Revolutionaries
  and Mensheviks). Vote? Overthrow the government? Or seek
  accord with it?
Non-Party conferences  a not an absolute political weapon
  of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries +
  anarchists. Caveant consules! (Let the consuls beware!
    —Editor.)




It is a well-tried trick of conventional bourgeois party
  politics and bourgeois parliarnentarism to try to "catch
  one" through concossions. But we reject the very basis of
  bourgeois parliamentarism, and "conventional (bourgeois)
  party politics"!!

  Communism”). The economic basis
    of socialism is not yet there. What is this basis?
  It is commodity exchange with the peasantry!!

[1] Lenin began to
      work on 

      The Tax in Kind pamphlet
      at the end of March 1921, just after the Tenth Party Congress,
      and finished it on April 21. He attached great importance to its
      earliest publication and distribution, because it explained the
      necessity of transition to the New Economic Policy. In early
      May, it was published as a pamphlet, and was soon after carried
      by the magazine Krasnaya Nov No. 1; it later appeared in
      pamphlet form in many towns, and was reprinted in part and in
      full in central and local papers. In 1921, it was translated
      into German, English and French.

      A special resolution of the Central Committee instructed all
      regional, gullernia and uyezd Party committees to use the
      pamphlet to explain the New Economic Policy to the working
      people.

In Lieu Of Introduction


The question of the tax in kind is at present attracting very great attention and is giving rise to much discussion and argument. This is quite natural, because in present conditions it is indeed one of the principal questions of policy.


The discussion is somewhat disordered, a fault to which, for very obvious reasons, we must all plead guilty. All the more useful would it be, therefore, to try to approach the question, not from its âtopicalâ aspect, but from the aspect of general principle. In other words, to examine the general, fundamental background of the picture on which we are now tracing the pattern of definite practical measures of present-day policy.


In order to make this attempt I will take the liberty of quoting a long passage from my pamphlet, The Chief Task of Our Day âLeft-Wingâ Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality. It was published by the Petrograd Soviet of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies in 1918 and contains, first, a newspaper article, dated March 11, 1918, on the Brest Peace, and, second, my polemic against the then existing group of Left Communists, dated May 5, 1918. The polemic is now superfluous and I omit it, leaving what appertains to the discussion on ,âstate capitalismâ an the main elements of our present-day economy, which is transitional from capitalism to socialism.


Here is what I wrote at the time: 


The Present-Day Economy Of Russia
(Extract From The 1918 Pamphlet)


State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six monthsâ time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country.


I can imagine with what noble indignation some people will recoil from these words.... What! The transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Socialist Republic would be a step forward? ... Isnât this the betrayal of socialism?


We must deal with this point in greater detail.


Firstly, we must examine the nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism that gives us the right and the grounds to call our country a Socialist Republic of Soviets.


Secondly, we must expose the error of those who fail to see the petty-bourgeois economic conditions and the petty-bourgeois element as the principal enemy of socialism in our country.


Thirdly, we must fully understand the economic implications of the distinction between the Soviet state and the bourgeois state.


Let us examine these three points.


No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of Russia, has denied its transitional character. Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the term Soviet Socialist Republic implies the determination of the Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, and not that the existing economic system is recognised as a socialist order.


But what does the word âtransitionâ mean? Does it not mean, as applied to an economy, that the present system contains elements, particles, fragments of both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. But not all who admit this take the trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various socio-economic structures that exist in Russia at the present time. And this is the crux of the question. 


Let us enumerate these elements:


(1)patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant farming;


(2)small commodity production (this includcs the majority of those peasants who sell their grain);


(3)private capitalism;


(4)state capitalism;


(5)socialism.


Russia is so vast and so varied that all these different types of socio-economic structures are intermingled. This is what constitutes the specific feature of the situation.


The question arises: What elements predominate? Clearly, in a small-peasant country, the petty-bourgeois element predominates and it must predominate, for the great majorityâthose working the landâare small commodity producers. The shell of state capitalism (grain monopoly, state-controlled entrepreneurs and traders, bourgeois co-operators) is pierced now in one place, now in another by profiteers, the chief object of profiteering being grain.


It is in this field that the main struggle is being waged. Between what elements is this struggle being waged if we are to speak in terms of economic categories such as âstate capitalismâ? Between the fourth and fifth in the order in which I have just enumerated them? Of course not. It is not state capitalism that is at war with socialism, but the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together against state capitalism and socialism. The petty bourgeoisie oppose every kind of state interference, accounting and control, whether it be state-capitalist or state-socialist. This is an unquestionable fact of reality whose misunderstanding lies at the root of many economic mistakes. The profiteer, the commercial racketeer, the disrupter of monopolyâthese are our principal âinternalâ enemies, the enemies of the economic measures of the Soviet power. A hundred and twenty-five years ago it might have been excusable for the French petty bourgeoisie, the most ardent and sincere revolutionaries, to try to crush the profiteer by executing a few of the âchosenâ and by making thunderous declarations. Today, however, the purely French approach to the question assumed by some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries can arouse nothing but disgust and revulsion in every politically conscious revolutionary. We know perfectly well that the economic basis of profiteering is both the small proprietors, who are exceptionally widespread in Russia, and private capitalism, of which every petty bourgeois is an agent. We know that the million tentacles of this petty-bourgeois octopus now and again encircle various sections of the workers, that instead of state monopoly, profiteering forces its way into every pore of our social and economic organism.


Those who fail to see this show by their blindness that they are slaves of petty-bourgeois prejudices....


The petty bourgeoisie have money put away, the few thousands that they made during the war by âhonestâ and especially by dishonest means. They are the characteristic economic type, that is, the basis of profiteering and private capitalism. Money is a certificate entitling the possessor to receive social wealth; and a vast section of small proprietors, numbering millions, cling to this certificate and conceal it from the âstateâ. They do not believe in socialism or communism, and âmark timeâ until the proletarian storm blows over. Either we subordinate the petty bourgeoisie to our control and accounting (we can do this if we organise the poor, that is, the majority of the population or semi-proletarians, round the politically conscious proletarian vanguard), or they will overthrow our workersâ power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. That is how the question stands. That is the only view we can take of the matter....


The petty bourgeois who hoards his thousands is an enemy of state capitalism. He wants to employ these thousands just for himself, against the poor, in opposition to any kind of state control. And the sum total of these thousands, amounting to many thousands of millions, forms the base for profiteering, which undermines our socialist construction. Let us assume that a certain number of workers produce in a few days values equal to 1,000. Let us then assume that 200 of this total vanishes owing to petty profiteering, various kinds of embezzlement and the evasion by the small proprietors of Soviet decrees and regulations. Every politically conscious worker will say that if better order and organisation could be obtained at the price of 300 out of the 1,000 he would willingly give 300 instead of 200, for it will be quite easy under the Soviet power to reduce this âtributeâ later on to, say, 100 or 50, once order and organisation are established and the petty-bourgeois disruption of state monopoly is completely overcome.


This simple illustration in figures, which I have deliberately simplified to the utmost in order to make it absolutely clear, explains the present correlation of state capitalism and socialism. The workers hold state power and have every legal opportunity of âtakingâ the whole thousand, without giving up a single kopek, except for socialist purposes. This legal opportunity, which rests upon the actual transition of power to the workers, is an element of socialism. But in many ways, the small-proprietary and private-capitalist element undermines this legal position, drags in profiteering and hinders the execution of Soviet decrees. State capitalism would be a gigantic step forward even if we paid more than we are paying at present (I took the numerical example deliberately to bring this out more sharply), because it is worth paying for âtuitionâ, because it is useful for the workers, because victory over disorder, economic ruin and laxity is the most important thing, because the continuation of the anarchy of small ownership is the greatest, the most serious danger, and it will certainly be our ruin (unless we overcome it), whereas not only will the payment of a heavier tribute to state capitalism not ruin us, it will lead us to socialism by the surest road. When the working class has learned how to defend the state system against the anarchy of small ownership, when it has learned to organise large-scale production on a national scale along state-capitalist lines, it will hold, if I may use the expression, all the trump cards, and the consolidation of socialism will be assured.


In the first place economically state capitalism is immeasurably superior to our present economic system.


In the second place there is nothing terrible in it for the Soviet power, for the Soviet state is a state in which the power of the workers and the poor is assured....


To make things even clearer, let us first of all take the most concrete example of state capitalism. Everybody knows what this example is. It is Germany. Here we have âthe last wordâ in modern large-scale capitalist engineering and planned organisation, subordinated to Junker-bourgeois imperialism. Cross out the words in italics, and in place of the militarist, Junker, bourgeois, imperialist state put also a state, but of a different social type, of a different class contentâa Soviet state, that is, a proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the conditions necessary for socialism.


Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this, and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries).


At the same time socialism is inconceivable unless the proletariat is the ruler of the state. This also is ABC. And history (which nobody, except Menshevik blockheads of the first order, ever expected to bring about âcompleteâ socialism smoothly, gently, easily and simply) has taken such a peculiar course that it has given birth in 1918 to two unconnected halves of socialism existing side by side like two future chickens in the single shell of international imperialism. In 1918, Germany and Russia had become the most striking embodiment of the material realisation of the economic, the productive and the socio-economic conditions for socialism, on the one hand, and the political conditions, on the other.


A victorious proletarian revolution in Germany would immediately and very easily smash any shell of imperialism (which unfortunately is made of the best steel, and hence cannot be broken by the efforts of any chicken) and would bring about the victory of world socialism for certain, without any difficulty, or with only slight difficultyâif, of course, by âdifficultyâ we mean difficulty on a world historical scale, and not in the parochial philistine sense.


While the revolution in Germany is still slow in âcoming forthâ, our task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no effort in copying it and not shrink from adopting dictatorial methods to hasten the copying of Western culture by barbarian Russia, without hesitating to use barbarous methods in fighting barbarism. If there are anarchists and Left Soeialist-Revolutionaries (I recall offhand the speeches of Karelin and Ghe at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee) who indulge in Karelin-like reflections and say that it is unbecoming for us revolutionaries to âtake lessonsâ from German imperialism, there is only one thing we can say in reply: the revolution that took these people seriously would perish irrevocably (and deservedly).


At present petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to both large-scale state capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called ânational accounting and control of production and distributionâ. Those who fail to understand this are committing an unpardonable mistake in economics. Either they do not know the facts of life, do not see what actually exists and are unable to look the truth in the face, or they confine themselves to abstractly comparing âsocialismâ with âcapitalismâ and fail to study the concrete forms and stages of the transition that is taking place in our country.


Let it be said in parenthesis that this is the very theoretical mistake which misled the best people in the Novaya Zhizn and Vperyod[2] camp. The worst and the mediocre of these, owing to their stupidity and spinelessness, tag along behind the bourgeoisie, of whom they stand in awe; the best of them have failed to understand that it was not without reason that the teachers of socialism spoke of a whole period of transition from capitalism to socialism and emphasised the âprolonged birth pangsâ of the new society.[3] And this new society is again an abstraction which can come into being only by passing through a series of varied, imperfect and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state.


It is because Russia cannot advance from the economic situation now existing-here without traversing the ground which is common to state capitalism and to socialism (national accounting and control) that the attempt to frighten others as well as themselves with âevolution towards state capitalismâ is utter theoretical nonsense. This is letting oneâs thoughts wander away from the true road of âevolutionâ, and failing to understand what this road is. In practice, it is equivalent to pulling us back to small proprietary capitalism.


In order to convince the reader that this is not the first time I have given this âhighâ appreciation of state capitalism and that I gave it before the Bolsheviks seized power, I take the liberty of quoting the following passage from my pamphlet, The Impending Catastrophe and How To Combat It, written in September 1917.


âTry to substitute for the Junker-capitalist state, for the landowner-capitalist state, a revolutionary-democratic state, i.e., a state which in a revolutionary way abolishes all privileges and does not fear to introduce the fullest democracy in a revolutionary way. You will find that, given a really revolutionary-democratic state, state-monopoly capitalism inevitably and unavoidably implies a step ... towards socialism....


âFor socialism is merely the next step forward from state-capitalist monopoly....


âState-monopoly capitalism is a complete material preparation for socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism there are no intermediate rungsâ (pp. 27 and 28).


Please note that this was written when Kerensky was in power, that we are discussing not the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the socialist state, but the ârevolutionary democraticâ state. Is it not clear that the higher we stand on this political ladder, the more completely we incorporate the socialist state and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviets, the less ought we to fear âstate capitalismâ? Is it not clear that from the material, economic and productive point of view, we are not yet on the âthresholdâ of socialism? Is it not clear that we cannot pass through the door of socialism without crossing the âthresholdâ we have not yet reached?...


The following is also extremely instructive.


When we argued with Comrade Bukharin in the Central Executive Committee, he declared, among other things, that on the question of high salaries for specialists âtheyâ were âto the right of Leninâ, for in this case âtheyâ saw no deviation from principle, bearing in mind Marxâs words that under certain conditions it is more expedient for the working class to âbuy out the whole lot of themâ[4] (namely, the whole lot of capitalists, i.e., to buy from the bourgeoisie the land, factories, works and other means of production).


That is a very interesting statement....


Let us consider Marxâs idea carefully.


Marx was talking about the Britain of the seventies of the last century, about the culminating point in the development of pre-monopoly capitalism. At that time Britain was a country in which militarism and bureaucracy were less pronounced than in any other, a country in which there was the greatest possibility of a âpeacefulâ victory for socialism in the sense of the workers âbuying outâ the bourgeoisie. And Marx said that under certain conditions the workers would certainly not refuse to buy out the bourgeoisie. Marx did not commit himself, or the future leaders of the socialist revolution, to matters of form, to ways and means of bringing about the revolution. He understood perfectly well that a vast number of new problems would arise, that the whole situation would change in the course of the revolution, and that the situation would change radically and often in the course of the revolution.


Well, and what about Soviet Russia? Is it not clear that after the seizure of power by the proletariat and after the crushing of the exploitersâ armed resistance and sabotageâcertain conditions prevail which correspond to those which might have existed in Britain half a century ago had a peaceful transition to socialism begun there? The subordination of the capitalists to the workers in Britain would have been assured at that time owing to the following circumstances: (1) the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population owing to the absence of a peasantry (in Britain in the seventies there where signs that gave hope of an extremely rapid spread of socialism among agricultural labourers); (2) the excellent organisation of the proletariat in trade unions (Britain was at that time the leading country in the world in this respect); (3) the comparatively high level of culture of the proletariat, which had been trained by centuries of development of political liberty; (4) the old habit of the well-organised British capitalists of settling political and economic questions by compromiseâat that time the British capitalists were better organised than the capitalists of any country in the world (this superiority has now passed to Germany). These were the circumstances which at the time gave rise to the idea that the peaceful subjugation of the British capitalists by the workers was possible.


In our country, at the present time, this subjugation is assured by certain premises of fundamental significance (the victory in October and the suppression, from October to February, of the capitalistsâ armed resistance and sabotage). But instead of the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population, and instead of a high degree of organisation among them, the important factor of victory in Russia was the support the proletarians received from the poor peasants and those who had experienced sudden ruin. Finally, we have neither a high degree of culture nor the habit of compromise. If these concrete conditions are carefully considered, it will become clear that we now can and ought to employ a combination of two methods. On the one hand, we must ruthlessly suppress the uncultured capitalists who refuse to have anything to do with âstate capitalismâ or to consider any form of compromise, and who continue by means of profiteering, by bribing the poor peasants, etc., to hinder the realisation of the measures taken by the Soviets. On the other hand, we must use the method of compromise, or of buying out the cultured capitalists who agree to âstate capitalismâ, who are capable of putting it into practice and who are useful to the proletariat as intelligent and experienced organisers of the largest types of enterprises, which actually supply products to tens of millions of people.


Bukharin is an extremely well-read Marxist economist. He therefore remembered that Marx was profoundly right when he taught the workers the importance of preserving the organisation of large-scale production, precisely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to socialism. Marx taught that (as an exception, and Britain was then an exception) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well, of buying them out, if the circumstances were such as to compel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to come over to socialism in a cultured and organised fashion, provided they were paid well.


But Bukharin went astray because he did not go deep enough into the specific features of the situation in Russia at the present timeâan exceptional situation when we, the Russian proletariat, are in advance of any Britain or any Germany as regards political system, as regards the strength of the workersâ political power, but are behind the most backward West-European country as regards organising a good state capitalism, as regards our level of culture and the degree of material and productive preparedness for the âintroductionâ of socialism. Is it not clear that the specific nature of the present situation creates the need for a specific type of âbuying outâ operation which the workers must offer to the most cultured, the most talented, the most capable organisers among the capitalists who are ready to enter the service of the Soviet power and to help honestly in organising âstateâ production on the largest possible scale? Is it not clear that in this specific situation we must make every effort to avoid two mistakes, both of which are of a petty-bourgeois nature? On the one hand, it would be a fatal mistake to declare that since there is a discrepancy between our economic âforcesâ and our political strength, it âfollowsâ that we should not have seized power. Such an argument can be advanced only by a âman in a mufflerâ, who forgets that there will always be such a âdiscrepancyâ, that it always exists in the development of nature as well as in the development of society, that only by a series of attemptsâeach of which, taken by itself, will be one-sided and will suffer from certain inconsistenciesâwill complete socialism be created by the revolutionary co-operation of the proletarians of all countries.


On the other hand, it would be an obvious mistake to give free rein to ranters and phrase-mongers who allow themselves to be carried away by the âdazzlingâ revolutionary spirit, but who are incapable of sustained, thoughtful and deliberate revolutionary work which takes into account the most difficult stages of transition.


Fortunately, the history of the development of revolutionary parties and of the struggle that Bolshevism waged against them has left us a heritage of sharply defined types, of which the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists are striking examples of bad revolutionaries. They are now shouting hysterically, choking and shouting themselves hoarse, against the âcompromiseâ of the âRight Bolsheviksâ. But they are incapable of understanding what is bad in âcompromiseâ, and why âcompromiseâ has been justly condemned by history and the course of the revolution.


Compromise in Kerenskyâs time meant the surrender of power to the imperialist bourgeoisie, and the question of power is the fundamental question of every revolution. Compromise by a section of the Bolsheviks in October November 1917 either meant that they feared the proletariat seizing power or wished to share power equally, not only with âunreliable fellow-travellersâ like the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, but also with enemies, with the Chernovists and the Mensheviks. The latter would inevitably have hindered us in fundamental matters, such as the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the ruthless suppression of the Bogayevskys, the universal setting up of the Soviet institutions, and in every act of confiscation.


Now power has been seized, retained and consolidated in the hands of a single party, the party of the proletariat, even without the âunreliable fellow-travellersâ. To speak of compromise at the present time when there is no question, and can be none, of sharing power, of renouncing the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, is merely to repeat, parrot-fashion, words which have been learned by heart but not understood. To describe as âcompromiseâ the fact that, having arrived at a situation when we can and must rule the country, we try to win over to our side, not grudging the cost, the most efficient people capitalism has trained and to take them into our service against small proprietary disintegration, reveals a total incapacity to think about the economic tasks of socialist construction.


Tax In Kind, Freedom To Trade And Concessions


In the arguments of 1918 quoted above there are a number of mistakes as regards the periods of time involved. These turned out to be longer than was anticipated at that time. That is not surprising. But the basic elements of our economy have remained the same. In a very large number of cases the peasant âpoorâ (proletarians and semi-proletarians) have become middle peasants. This has caused an increase in the small-proprietor, petty-bourgeois âelementâ. The Civil War of 1918-20 aggravated the havoc in the country, retarded the restoration of its productive forces, and bled the proletariat more than any other class. To this was added the 1920 crop failure, the fodder shortage and the loss of cattle, which still further retarded the rehabilitation of transport and industry, because, among other things, it interfered with the employment of peasantsâ horses for carting wood, our main type of fuel.


As a result, the political situation in the spring of 1921 was such that immediate, very resolute and urgent measures had to be taken to improve the condition of the peasants and to increase their productive forces.


Why the peasants and not the workers?


Because you need grain and fuel to improve the condition of the workers. This is the biggest âhitchâ at the present time, from the standpoint of the economy as a whole. For it is impossible to increase the production and collection of grain and the storage and delivery of fuel except by improving the condition of the peasantry, and raising their productive forces. We must start with the peasantry. Those who fail to understand this, and think this putting the peasantry in the forefront is ârenunciationâ of the dictatorship of the proletariat, or something like that, simply do not stop to think, and allow themselves to be swayed by the power of words. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the direction of policy by the proletariat. The proletariat, as the leading and ruling class, must be able to direct policy in such a way as to solve first the most urgent and âvexedâ problem. The most urgent thing at the present time is to take measures that will immediately increase the productive forces of peasant farming. Only in this way will it be possible to improve the condition of the workers, strengthen the alliance between the workers and peasants, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletarian or representative of the proletariat who refused to improve the condition of the workers in this way would in fact prove himself to be an accomplice of the whiteguards and the capitalists; to refuse to do it in this way means putting the craft interests of the workers above their class interests, and sacrificing the interests of the whole of the working class, its dictatorship, its alliance with the peasantry against the landowners and capitalists, and its leading role in the struggle for the emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital, for the sake of an immediate, short-term and partial advantage for the workers.


Thus, the first thing we need is immediate and serious measures to raise the productive forces of the peasantry.


This cannot be done without making important changes in our food policy. One such change was the replacement of the surplus appropriation system by the tax in kind, which implies a free market, at least in local economic exchange, after the tax has been paid.


What is the essence of this change?


Wrong ideas on this point are widespread. They are due mainly to the fact that no attempt is being made to study the meaning of the transition or to determine its implications, it being assumed that the change is from communism in general to the bourgeois system in general. To counteract this mistake, one has to refer to what was said in May 1918.


The tax in kind is one of the forms of transition from that peculiar War Communism, which was forced on us by extreme want, ruin and war, to regular socialist exchange of products. The latter, in its turn, is one of the forms of transition from socialism, with the peculiar features due to the predominantly small-peasant population, to communism.


Under this peculiar War Communism we actually took from the peasant all his surplusesâand sometimes even a part of his necessariesâto meet the requirements of the army and sustain the workers. Most of it we took on loan, for paper money. But for that, we would not have beaten the landowners and capitalists in a ruined small-peasant country. The fact that we did (in spite of the help our exploiters got from the most powerful countries of the world) shows not only the miracles of heroism the workers and peasants can perform in the struggle for their emancipation; it also shows that when the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kautsky and Co. blamed us for this War Communism they were acting as lackeys of the bourgeoisie. We deserve credit for it.


Just how much credit is a fact of equal importance. It was the war and the ruin that forced us into War Communism. It was not, and could not be, a policy that corresponded to the economic tasks of the proletariat. It was a makeshift. The correct policy of the proletariat exercising its dictatorship in a small-peasant country is to obtain grain in exchange for the manufactured goods the peasant needs. That is the only kind of food policy that corresponds to the tasks of the proletariat, and can strengthen the foundations of socialism and lead to its complete victory.


The tax in kind is a transition to this policy. We are still so ruined and crushed by the burden of war (which was on but yesterday and could break out anew tomorrow, owing to the rapacity and malice of the capitalists) that we cannot give the peasant manufactured goods in return for all the grain we need. Being aware of this, we are introducing the tax in kind, that is, we shall take the minimum of grain we require (for the army and the workers) in the form of a tax and obtain the rest in exchange for manufactured goods.


There is something else we must not forget. Our poverty and ruin are so great that we cannot restore large-scale socialist state industry at one stroke. This can be done with large stocks of grain and fuel in the big industrial centres, replacement of worn-out machinery, and so on. Experience has convinced us that this cannot be done at one stroke, and we know that after the ruinous imperialist war even the wealthiest and most advanced countries will be able to solve this problem only over a fairly long period of years. Hence, it is necessary, to a certain extent, to help to restore small industry, which does not demand of the state machines, large stocks of raw material, fuel and food, and which can immediately render some assistance to peasant farming and increase its productive forces right away.


What is to be the effect of all this?


It is the revival of the petty bourgeoisie and of capitalism on the basis of some freedom of trade (if only local). That much is certain and it is ridiculous to shut our eyes to it.


Is it necessary? Can it be justified? Is it not dangerous?


Many such questions are being asked, and most are merely evidence of simple-mindedness, to put it mildly.


Look at my May 1918 definition of the clements (constituent parts) of the various socio-economic structures in our economy. No one can deny the existence of all these five stages (or constituent parts), of the five forms of economyâfrom the patriarchal, i.e., semi-barbarian, to the socialist system. That the small-peasant âstructureâ, partly patriarchal, partly petty bourgeois, predominates in a small-peasant country is self-evident. It is an incontrovertible truth, elementary to political economy, which even the laymanâs everyday experience will confirm, that once you have exchange the small economy is bound to develop the petty-bourgeois-capitalist way.


What is the policy the socialist proletariat can pursue in the face of this economic reality? Is it to give the small peasant all he needs of the goods produced by large-scale socialist industries in exchange for his grain and raw materials? This would be the most desirable and âcorrectâ policyâand we have started on it. But we cannot supply all the goods, very far from it; nor shall we be able to do so very soonâat all events not until we complete the first stage of the electrification of the whole country. What is to be done? One way is to try to prohibit entirely, to put the lock on all development of private, non-state exchange, i.e., trade, i.e., capitalism, which is inevitable with millions of small producers. But such a policy would be foolish and suicidal for the party that tried to apply it. It would be foolish because it is economically impossible. It would be suicidal because the party that tried to apply it would meet with inevitable disaster. Let us admit it: some Communists have sinned âin thought, word and deedâ by adopting just such a policy. We shall try to rectify these mistakes, and this must be done without fail, otherwise things will come to a very sorry state.


The alternative (and this is the only sensible and the last possible policy) is not to try to prohibit or put the lock on the development of capitalism, but to channel it into state capitalism. This is economically possible, for state capitalism existsâin varying form and degreeâwherever there are elements of unrestricted trade and capitalism in general.


Can the Soviet state and the dictatorship of the proletariat be combined with state capitalism? Are they compatible?


Of course they are. This is exactly what I argued in May 1918. I hope I had proved it then. I had also proved that state capitalism is a step forward compared with the small proprietor (both small-patriarchal and petty-bourgeois) element. Those who compare state capitalism only with socialism commit a host of mistakes, for in the present political and economic circumstances it is essential to compare state capitalism also with petty-bourgeois production.


The whole problemâin theoretical and practical termsâis to find the correct methods of directing the development of capitalism (which is to some extent and for some time inevitable) into the channels of state capitalism, and to determine how we are to hedge it about with conditions to ensure its transformation into socialism in the near future.


In order to approach the solution of this problem we must first of all picture to ourselves as distinctly as possible what state capitalism will and can be in practice inside the Soviet system and within the framework of the Soviet state.


Concessions are the simplest example of how the Soviet government directs the development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism and âimplantsâ state capitalism. We all agree now that concessions are necessary, but have we all thought about the implications? What are concessions under the Soviet system, viewed in the light of the above-mentioned forms of economy and their interrelations? They are an agreement, an alliance, a bloc between the Soviet, i.e., proletarian, state power and state capitalism against the small-proprietor (patriarchal and petty-bourgeois) element. The concessionaire is a capitalist. He conducts his business on capitalist lines, for profit, and is willing to enter into an agreement with the proletarian government in order to obtain superprofits or raw materials which he cannot otherwise obtain, or can obtain only with great difficulty. Soviet power gains by the development of the productive forces, and by securing an increased quantity of goods immediately, or within a very short period. We have, say, a hundred oilfields, mines and forest tracts. We cannot develop all of them for we lack the machines, the food and the transport. This is also why we are doing next to nothing to develop the other territories. Owing to the insufficient development of the large enterprises the small-proprietor element is more pronounced in all its forms, and this is reflected in the deterioration of the surrounding (and later the whole of) peasant farming, the disruption of its productive forces, the decline in its confidence in the Soviet power, pilfering and widespread petty (the most dangerous) profiteering, etc. By âimplantingâ state capitalism in the form of concessions, the Soviet government strengthens large-scale production as against petty production, advanced production as against backward production, and machine production as against hand production. It also obtains a larger quantity of the products of large-scale industry (its share of the output), and strengthens state regulated economic relations as against the anarchy of petty-bourgeois relations. The moderate and cautious application of the concessions policy will undoubtedly help us quickly to improve (to a modest extent) the state of industry and the condition of the workers and peasants. We shall, of course, have all this at the price of certain sacrifices and the surrender to the capitalist of many millions of poods of very valuable products. The scale and the conditions under which concessions cease to be a danger and are turned to our advantage depend on the relation of forces and are decided in the struggle, for concessions are also a form of struggle, and are a continuation of the class struggle in another form, and in no circumstances are they a substitution of class peace for class war. Practice will determine the methods of struggle.


Compared with other forms of state capitalism within the Soviet system, concessions are perhaps the most simple and clear-cut form of state capitalism. It involves a formal written agreement with the most civilised, advanced, West European capitalism. We know exactly what our gains and our losses, our rights and obligations are. We know exactly the term for which the concession is granted. We know the terms of redemption before the expiry of the agreement if it provides for such redemption. We pay a certain âtributeâ to world capitalism; we âransomâ ourselves under certain arrangements, thereby immediately stabilising the Soviet power and improving our economic conditions. The whole difficulty with concessions is giving the proper consideration and appraisal of all the circumstances when concluding a concession agreement, and then seeing that it is fulfilled. Difficulties there certainly are, and mistakes will probably be inevitable at the outset. But these are minor difficulties compared with the other problems of the social revolution and, in particular, with the difficulties arising from other forms of developing, permitting and implanting state capitalism.


The most important task that confronts all Party and Soviet workers in connection with the introduction of the tax in kind is to apply the principles of the âconcessionsâ policy (i.e., a policy that is similar to âconcessionâ state capitalism) to the other forms of capitalismâunrestricted trade, local exchange, etc.


Take the co-operatives. It is not surprising that the tax in kind decree immediately necessitated a revision of the regulations governing the co-operatives and a certain extension of their âfreedomâ and rights. The co-operatives are also a form of state capitalism, but a less simple one; its outline is less distinct, it is more intricate and therefore creates greater practical difficulties for the government. The small commodity producersâ co-operatives (and it is these, and not the workersâ co-operatives, that we are discussing as the predominant and typical form in a small-peasant country) inevitably give rise to petty-bourgeois, capitalist relations, facilitate their development, push the small capitalists into the foreground and benefit them most. It cannot be otherwise, since the small proprietors predominate, and exchange is necessary and possible. In Russiaâs present conditions, freedom and rights for the co-operative societies mean freedom and rights for capitalism. It would be stupid or criminal to close our eyes to this obvious truth.


But, unlike private capitalism, âco-operativeâ capitalism under the Soviet system is a variety of state capitalism, and as such it is advantageous and useful for us at the present timeâin certain measure, of course. Since the tax in kind means the free sale of surplus grain (over and above that taken in the form of the tax), we must exert every effort to direct this development of capitalismâfor a free market is development of capitalismâinto the channels of co-operative capitalism. It resembles state capitalism in that it facilitates accounting, control, supervision and the establishment of contractual relations between the state (in this case the Soviet state) and the capitalist. Co-operative trade is more advantageous and useful than private trade not only for the above-mentioned reasons, but also because it facilitates the association and organisation of millions of people, and eventually of the entire population, and this in its turn is an enormous gain from the standpoint of the subsequent transition from state capitalism to socialism.


Let us make a comparison of concessions and co-operatives as forms of state capitalism. Concessions are based on large-scale machine industry; co-operatives are based on small, handicraft, and partly even on patriarchal industry. Each concession agreement affects one capitalist, firm, syndicate, cartel or trust. Co-operative societies embrace many thousands and even millions of small proprietors. Concessions allow and even imply a definite agreement for a specified period. Co-operative societies allow of neither. It is much easier to repeal the law on the co-operatives than to annul a concession agreement, but the annulment of an agreement means a sudden rupture of the practical relations of economic alliance, or economic coexistence, with the capitalist, whereas the repeal of the law on the co-operatives, or any law, for that matter, does not immediately break off the practical coexistence of Soviet power and the small capitalists, nor, in general, is it able to break off the actual economic relations. It is easy to âkeep an eyeâ on a concessionaire but not on the co-operators. The transition from concessions to socialism is a transition from one form of large-scale production to another. The transition from small-proprietor co-operatives to socialism is a transition from small to large-scale production, i.e., it is more complicated, but, if successful, is capable of embracing wider masses of the population, and pulling up the deeper and more tenacious roots of the old, pre-socialist and even pre-capitalist relations, which most stubbornly resist all âinnovationsâ. The concessions policy, if successful, will give us a few modelâcompared with our ownâlarge enterprises built on the level of modern advanced capitalism. After a few decades these enterprises will revert to us in their entirety. The co-operative policy, if successful, will result in raising the small economy and in facilitating its transition, within an indefinite period, to large-scale production on the basis of voluntary association.


Take a third form of state capitalism. The state enlists the capitalist as a merchant and pays him a definite commission on the sale of state goods and on the purchase of the produce of the small producer. A fourth form: the state leases to the capitalist entrepreneur an industrial establishment, oilfields, forest tracts, land, etc., which belong to the state, the lease being very similar to a concession agreement. We make no mention of, we give no thought or notice to, these two latter forms of state capitalism, not because we are strong and clever but because we are weak and foolish. We are afraid to look the âvulgar truthâ squarely in the face, and too often yield to âexalting deceptionââ.[5] We keep repeating that âweâ are passing from capitalism to socialism, but do not bother to obtain a distinct picture of the âweâ. To keep this picture clear we must constantly have in mind the whole listâwithout any exceptionâof the constituent parts of our national economy, of all its diverse forms that I gave in my article of May 5, 1918. âWeâ, the vanguard, the advanced contingent of the proletariat, are passing directly to socialism; but the advanced contingent is only a small part of the whole of the proletariat while the latter, in its turn, is only a small part of the whole population. If âweâ are successfully to solve the problem of our immediate transition to socialism, we must understand what intermediary paths, methods, means and instruments are required for the transition from pre-capitalist relations to socialism. That is the whole point.


Look at the map of the R.S.F.S.R. There is room for dozens of large civilised states in those vast areas which lie to the north of Vologda, the south-east of Rostov-on-Don and Saratov, the south of Orenburg and Omsk, and the north of Tomsk. They are a realm of patriarchalism, and semi- and downright barbarism. And what about the peasant backwoods of the rest of Russia, where scores of versts of country track, or rather of trackless country, lie between the villages and the railways, i.e., the material link with the big cities, large-scale industry, capitalism and culture? Isnât that also an area of wholesale patriarchalism, Oblomovism[6] and semi-barbarism?


Is an immediate transition to socialism from the state of affairs predominating in Russia conceivable? Yes, it is, to a certain degree, but on one condition, the precise nature of which we now know thanks to a great piece of scientific work[7] that has been completed. It is electrification. If we construct scores of district electric power stations (we now know where and how these can and should be constructed), and transmit electric power to every village, if we obtain a sufficient number of electric motors and other machinery, we shall not need, or shall hardly need, any transition stages or intermediary links between patriarchalism and socialism. But we know perfectly well that it will take at least ten years only to complete the first stage of this âoneâ condition; this period can be conceivably reduced only if the proletarian revolution is victorious in such countries as Britain, Germany or the U.S.A.


Over the next few years we must learn to think of the intermediary links that can facilitate the transition from patriarchalism and small production to socialism. âWeâ continue saying now and again that âcapitalism is a bane and socialism is a boonâ. But such an argument is wrong, because it fails to take into account the aggregate of the existing economic forms and singles out only two of them.


Capitalism is a bane compared with socialism. Capitalism is a boon compared with medievalism, small production, and the evils of bureaucracy which spring from the dispersal of the small producers. Inasmuch as we are as yet unable to pass directly from small production to socialism, some capitalism is inevitable as the elemental product of small production and exchange; so that we must utilise capitalism (particularly by directing it into the channels of state capitalism) as the intermediary link between small production and socialism, as a means, a path, and a method of increasing the productive forces.


Look at the economic aspect of the evils of bureaucracy. We see nothing of them on May 5, 1918. Six months after the October Revolution, with the old bureaucratic apparatus smashed from top to bottom, we feel none of its evils.


A year later, the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (March 18-23, 1919)[8] adopted a new Party Programme in which we spoke forthrightly of âa partial revival of bureaucracy within the Soviet systemâânot fearing to admit the evil, but desiring to reveal, expose and pillory it and to stimulate thought, will, energy and action to combat it.


Two years later, in the spring of 1921, after the Eighth Congress of Soviets (December 1920), which discussed the evils of bureaucracy, and after the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (March 1921), which summed up the controversies closely connected with an analysis of these evils, we find them even more distinct and sinister. What are their economic roots? They are mostly of a dual character: on the one hand, a developed bourgeoisie needs a bureaucratic apparatus, primarily a military apparatus, and then a judiciary, etc., to use against the revolutionary movement of the workers (and partly of the peasants). That is something we have not got. Ours are class courts directed against the bourgeoisie. Ours is a class army directed against the bourgeoisie. The evils of bureaucracy are not in the army, but in the institutions serving it. In our country bureaucratic practices have different economic roots, namely, the atomised and scattered state of the small producer with his poverty, illiteracy, lack of culture, the absence of roads and exchange between agriculture and industry, the absence of connection and interaction between them. This is largely the result of the Civil War. We could not restore industry when we were blockaded, besieged on all sides, cut off from the whole world and later from the grain-bearing South, Siberia, and the coalfields. We could not afford to hesitate in introducing War Communism, or daring to go to the most desperate extremes: to save the workersâ and peasantsâ rule we had to suffer an existence of semi-starvation and worse than semi-starvation, but to hold on at all costs, in spite of unprecedented ruin and the absence of economic intercourse. We did not allow ourselves to be frightened, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks did (who, in fact, followed the bourgeoisie largely because they were scared). But the factor that was crucial to victory in a blockaded countryâa besieged fortressârevealed its negative side by the spring of 1921, just when the last of the whiteguard forces were finally driven from the territory of the R.S.F.S.R. In the besieged fortress, it was possible and imperative to âlock upâ all exchange; with the masses displaying extraordinary heroism this could be borne for three years. After that, the ruin of the small producer increased, and the restoration of large-scale in dustry was further delayed, and postponed. Bureaucratic practices, as a legacy of the âsiegeâ and the superstructure built over the isolated and downtrodden state of the small producer, fully revealed themselves.


We must learn to admit an evil fearlessly in order to combat it the more firmly, in order to start from scratch again and again; we shall have to do this many a time in every sphere of our activity, finish what was left undone and choose different approaches to the problem. In view of the obvious delay in the restoration of large-scale industry, the âlocking upâ of exchange between industry and agriculture has become intolerable. Consequently, we must concentrate on what we can do: restoring small industry, helping things from that end, propping up the side of the structure that has been half-demolished by the war and blockade. We must do everything possible to develop trade at all costs, without being afraid of capitalism, because the limits we have put to it (the expropriation of the landowners and of the bourgeoisie in the economy, the rule of the workers and peasants in politics) are sufficiently narrow and âmoderateâ. This is the fundamental idea and economic significance of the tax in kind.


All Party and Soviet workers must concentrate their efforts and attention on generating the utmost local initiative in economic developmentâin the gubernias, still more in the uyezds, still more in the volosts and villagesâfor the special purpose of immediately improving peasant farming, even if by âsmallâ means, on a small scale, helping it by developing small local industry. The integrated state economic plan demands that this should become the focus of concern and âpriorityâ effort. Some improvement here, closest to the broadest and deepest âfoundationâ, will permit of the speediest transition to a more vigorous and successful restoration of large-scale industry.


Hitherto the food supply worker has known only one fundamental instruction: collect 100 per cent of the grain appropriations. Now he has another instruction: collect 100 per cent of the tax in the shortest possible time and then collect another 100 per cent in exchange for the goods of large-scale and small industry. Those who collect 75 per cent of the tax and 75 per cent (of the second hundred) in exchange for the goods of large scale and small industry will be doing more useful work of national importance than those who collect 100 per cent of the tax and 55 per cent (of the second hundred) by means of exchange. The task of the food supply worker now becomes more complicated. On the one hand, it is a fiscal task: collect the tax as quickly and as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, it is a general economic task: try to direct the co-operatives, assist small industry, develop local initiative in such a way as to increase the exchange between agriculture and industry and put it on a sound basis. Our bureaucratic practices prove that we are still doing a very bad job of it. We must not be afraid to admit that in this respect we still have a great deal to learn from the capitalist. We shall compare the practical experience of the various gubernias, uyezds, volosts and villages: in one place private capitalists, big and small, have achieved so much; those are their approximate profits. That is the tribute, the fee, we have to pay for the âschoolingâ. We shall not mind paying for it if we learn a thing or two. That much has been achieved in a neighbouring locality through co-operation. Those are the profits of the co-operatives. And in a third place, that much has been achieved by purely state and communist methods (for the present, this third case will be a rare exception).


It should be the primary task of every regional economic centre and economic conference of the gubernia executive committees immediately to organise various experiments, or systems of âexchangeâ for the surplus stocks remaining after the tax in kind has been paid. In a few monthsâ time practical results must be obtained for comparison and study. Local or imported salt; paraffin oil from the nearest town; the handicraft wood-working industry; handicrafts using local raw materials and producing certain, perhaps not very important, but necessary and useful, articles for the peasants; âgreen coalâ (the utilisation of small local water power resources for electrification), and so on and so forthâall this must be brought into play in order to stimulate exchange between industry and agriculture at all costs. Those who achieve the best results in this sphere, even by means of private capitalism, even without the co-operatives, or without directly transforming this capitalism into state capitalism, will do more for the cause of socialist construction in Russia than those who âponder overâ the purity of communism, draw up regulations, rules and instructions for state capitalism and the co-operatives, but do nothing practical to stimulate trade.


Isnât it paradoxical that private capital should be helping socialism?


Not at all. It is, indeed, an irrefutable economic fact. Since this is a small-peasant country with transport in an extreme state of dislocation, a country emerging from war and blockade under the political guidance of the proletariatâwhich controls the transport system and large-scale industryâit inevitably follows, first, that at the present moment local exchange acquires first-class significance, and, second, that there is a possibility of assisting socialism by means of private capitalism (not to speak of state capitalism).


Letâs not quibble about words. We still have too much of that sort of thing. We must have more variety in practical experience and make a wider study of it. In certain circumstances, the exemplary organisation of local work, even on the smallest scale, is of far greater national importance than many branches of central state work. These are precisely the circumstances now prevailing in peasant farming in general, and in regard to the exchange of the surplus products of agriculture for industrial goods in particular. Exemplary organisation in this respect, even in a single volost, is of far greater national importance than the âexemplaryâ improvement of the central apparatus of any People Commissariat; over the past three and a half years our central apparatus has been built up to such an extent that it has managed to acquire a certain amount of harmful routine; we cannot improve it quickly to any extent, we do not know how to do it. Assistance in the work of radically improving it, securing an influx of fresh forces, combating bureaucratic practices effectively and overcoming this harmful routine must come from the localities and the lower ranks, with the model organisation of a âcomplexâ, even if on a small scale. I say âcomplexâ, meaning not just one farm, one branch of industry, or one factory, but a totality of economic relations, a totality of economic exchange, even if only in a small locality.


Those of us who are doomed to remain at work in the centre will continue the task of improving the apparatus and purging it of bureaucratic evils, even if only on a modest and immediately achievable scale. But the greatest assistance in this task is coming, and will come, from the localities. Generally speaking, as far as I can observe, things are better in the localities than at the centre; and this is understandable, for, naturally, the evils of bureaucracy are concentrated at the centre. In this respect, Moscow cannot but be the worst city, and in general the worst âlocalityâ, in the Republic. In the localities we have deviations from the average to the good and the bad sides, the latter being less frequent than the former. The deviations towards the bad side are the abuses committed by former government officials, landowners, bourgeois and other scum who play up to the Communists and who sometimes commit abominable outrages and acts of tyranny against the peasantry. This calls for a terrorist purge, summary trial and the firing squad. Let the Martovs, the Chernovs, and non-Party philistines like them, beat their breasts and exclaim: âI thank Thee, Lord, that I am not as âtheseâ, and have never accepted terrorism.â These simpletons âdo not accept terrorismâ because they choose to be servile accomplices of the whiteguards in fooling the workers and peasants. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks âdo not accept terrorismâ because under the flag of âsocialismâ they are fulfilling their function of placing the masses at the mercy of the whiteguard terrorism. This was proved by the Kerensky regime and the Kornilov putsch in Russia, by the Kolchak regime in Siberia, and by Menshevism in Georgia. It was proved by the heroes of the Second International and of the âTwo-and-a-Halfâ[9] International in Finland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy, Britain, etc. Let the flunkey accomplices of whiteguard terrorism wallow in their repudiation of all terrorism. We shall speak the bitter and indubitable truth: in countries beset by an unprecedented crisis, the collapse of old ties, and the intensification of the class struggle after the imperialist war of 1914-18âand that means all the countries of the worldâterrorism cannot be dispensed with, notwithstanding the hypocrites and phrase-mongers. Either the whiteguard, bourgeois terrorism of the American, British (Ireland), Italian (the fascists), German, Hungarian and other types, or Red, proletarian terrorism. There is no middle course, no âthirdâ course, nor can there be any.


The deviations towards the good side are the success achieved in combating the evils of bureaucracy, the great attention shown for the needs of the workers and peasants, and the great care in developing the economy, raising the productivity of labour and stimulating local exchange between agriculture and industry. Although the good examples are more numerous than the bad ones, they are, nevertheless, rare. Still, they are there. Young, fresh communist forces, steeled by civil war and privation, are coming forward in all localities. We are still doing far too little to promote these forces regularly from lower to higher posts. This can and must be done more persistently, and on a wider scale than at present. Some workers can and should be transferred from work at the centre to local work. As leading men of uyezds, and of volosts, where they can organise economic work as a whole on exemplary lines, they will do far more good, and perform work of far greater national importance, than by performing some junction at the centre. The exemplary organisation of the work will help to train new workers and provide examples that other districts could follow with relative ease. We at the centre shall be able to do a great deal to encourage the other districts all over the country to âfollowâ the good examples, and even make it mandatory for them to do so.


By its very nature, the work of developing âexchangeâ between agriculture and industry, the exchange of after-tax surpluses for the output of small, mainly handicraft, industry, calls for independent, competent and intelligent local initiative. That is why it is now extremely important from the national standpoint to organise the work in the uyezds and volosts on exemplary lines. In military affairs, during the last Polish war, for example, we were not afraid of departing from the bureaucratic hierarchy, âdowngradingâ, or transferring members of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic to lower posts (while allowing them to retain their higher rank at the centre). Why not now transfer several members of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, or members of collegiums, or other high-ranking comrades, to uyezds or even volosts work? Surely, we have not become so âbureaucratisedâ as to âbe ashamedâ of that. And we shall find scores of workers in the central bodies who will be glad to accept. The economic development of the whole Republic will gain enormously; and the exemplary volosts, or uyezds, will play not only a great, but a positively crucial and historic role.


Incidentely, we should note as a small but significant circumstance the necessary change in our attitude to the problem of combating profiteering. We must foster âproperâ trade, which is one that does not evade state control; it is to our advantage to develop it. But profiteering, in its politico-economic sense, cannot be distinguished from âproperâ trade. Freedom of trade is capitalism; capitalism is profiteering. It would be ridiculous to ignore this.


What then should be done? Shall we declare profiteering to be no longer punishable?


No. We must revise and redraft all the laws on profiteering, and declare all pilfering and every direct or indirect, open or concealed evasion of state control, supervision and accounting to be a punishable offence (and in fact prosecuted with redoubled severity). It is by presenting the question in this way (the Council of Peopleâs Commissars has already started, that is to say, it has ordered that work be started, on the revision of the anti-profiteering laws) that we shall succeed in directing the rather inevitable but necessary development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism.


Political Summary And Deductions


I still have to deal, if briefly, with the political situation, and the way it has taken shape and changed in connection with the economic developments outlined above.


I have already said that the fundamental features of our economy in 1921 are the same as those in 1918. The spring of 1921, mainly as a result of the crop failure and the loss of cattle, brought a sharp deterioration in the condition of the peasantry, which was bad enough because of the war and blockade. This resulted in political vacillations which, generally speaking, express the very ânatureâ of the small producer. Their most striking expression was the Kronstadt mutiny.


The vacillation of the petty-bourgeois element was the most characteristic feature of the Kronstadt events. There was very little that was clear, definite and fully shaped. We heard nebulous slogans about âfreedomâ, âfreedom of tradeâ, âemancipationâ, âSoviets without the Bolsheviksâ, or new elections to the Soviets, or relief from âParty dictatorshipâ, and so on and so forth. Both the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries declared the Kronstadt movement to be âtheir ownâ. Victor Chernov sent a messenger to Kronstadt. On the latterâs proposal, the Menshevik Valk, one of the Kronstadt leaders, voted for the Constituent Assembly. In a flash, with lightning speed, you might say, the whiteguards mobilised all their forces âfor Kronstadtâ. Their military experts in Kronstadt, a number of experts, and not Kozlovsky alone, drew up a plan for a landing at Oranienbaum, which scared the vacillating mass of Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and non-party elements. More than fifty Russian whiteguard newspapers published abroad conducted a rabid campaign âfor Kronstadtâ. The big banks, all the forces of finance capital, collected funds to assist Kronstadt. That shrewd leader of the bourgeoisie and the landowners, the Cadet Milyukov, patiently explained to the simpleton Victor Chernov directly (and to the Mensheviks Dan and Rozhkov, who are in jail in Petrograd for their connection with the Kronstadt events, indirectly) that that there is no need to hurry with the Constituent Assembly, and that Soviet power can and must be supportedâonly without the Bolsheviks.


Of course, it is easy to be cleverer than conceited simpletons like Chernov, the petty-bourgeois phrase-monger, or like Martov, the knight of philistine reformism doctored to pass for Marxism. Properly speaking, the point is not that Milyukov, as an individual, has more brains, but that, because of his class position, the party leader of the big bourgeoisie sees and understands the class essence and political interaction of things more clearly than the leaders of the petty bourgeoisie, the Chernovs and Martovs. For the bourgeoisie is really a class force which, under capitalism, inevitably rules both under a monarchy and in the most democratic republic, and which also inevitably enjoys the support of the world bourgeoisie. But the petty bourgeoisie, i.e., all the heroes of the Second International and of the âTwo-and-a-Halfâ International, cannot, by the very economic nature of things, be anything else than the expression of class impotence; hence the vacillation, phrase-mongering and helplessness. In 1789, the petty bourgeois could still be great revolutionaries. In 1848, they were ridiculous and pathetic. Their actual role in 1917-21 is that of abominable agents and out-and-out servitors of reaction, be their names Chernov, Martov, Kautsky, MacDonald, or what have you.


Martov showed himself to be nothing but a philistine Narcissus when he declared in his Berlin journal[10] that Kronstadt not only adopted Menshevik slogans but also proved that there could be an anti-Bolshevik movement which did not entirely serve the interests of the whiteguards, the capitalists and the landowners. He says in effect: âLet us shut our eyes to the fact that all the genuine whiteguards hailed the Kronstadt mutineers and collected funds in aid of Kronstadt through the banks!â Compared with the Chernovs and Martovs, Milyukov is right, for he is revealing the true tactics of the real whiteguard force, the force of the capitalists and landowners. He declares: âIt does not matter whom we support, be they anarchists or any sort of Soviet government, as long as the Bolsheviks are overthrown, as long as there is a shift in power; it does not matter whether to the right or to the left, to the Mensheviks or to the anarchists, as long as it is away from the Bolsheviks. As for the restââweâ, the Milyukovs, âweâ, the capitalists and landowners, will do the rest âourselvesâ; we shall slap down the anarchist pygmies, the Chernovs and the Martovs, as we did Chernov and Maisky in Siberia, the Hungarian Chernovs and Martovs in Hungary, Kautsky in Germany and the Friedrich Adlers and Co. in Vienna.â The real, hard-headed bourgeoisie have made fools of hundreds of these philistine Narcissusesâwhether Menshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary or non-partyâand have driven them out scores of times in all revolutions in all countries. History proves it. The facts bear it out. The Narcissuses will talk; the Milyukovs and whiteguards will act.


Milyukov is absolutely right when he says, âIf only there is a power shift away from the Bolsheviks, no matter whether it is a little to the right or to the left, the rest will take care of itself.â This is class truth, confirmed by the history of revolutions in all countries, and by the centuries of modern history since the Middle Ages. The scattered small producers, the peasants, are economically and politically united either by the bourgeoisie (this has always beenâand will always beâthe case under capitalism in all countries, in all modern revolutions), or by the proletariat (that was the case in a rudimentary form for a very short period at the peak of some of the greatest revolutions in modern history; that has been the case in Russia in a more developed form in 1917-21). Only the Narcissuses will talk and dream about a âthirdâ path, and a âthird forceâ.


With enormous difficulty, and in the course of desperate struggles, the Bolsheviks have trained a proletarian vanguard that is capable of governing; they have created and successfully defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the test of four years of practical experience, the relation of class forces in Russia has become as clear as day: the steeled and tempered vanguard of the only revolutionary class; the vacillating petty-bourgeois element; and the Milyukovs, the capitalists and landowners, lying in wait abroad and supported by the world bourgeoisie. It is crystal-clear: only the latter are able to take advantage of any âshift of powerâ, and will certainly do so.


In the 1918 pamphlet I quoted above, this point was put very clearly: âthe principal enemyâ is the âpetty-bourgeois elementâ. âEither we subordinate it to our control and accounting, or it will overthrow the workersâ power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. This is how the question stands. That is the only view we can take of the matter.â (Excerpt from the pamphlet of May 5, 1918, cf. above.)


Our strength lies in complete clarity and the sober consideration of all the existing class magnitudes, both Russian and international; and in the inexhaustible energy, iron resolve and devotion in struggle that arise from this. We have many enemies, but they are disunited, or do not know their own minds (like all the petty bourgeoisie, all the Martovs and Chernovs, all the non-party elements and anarchists). But we are unitedâdirectly among ourselves and indirectly with the proletarians of all countries; we know just what we want. That is why we are invincible on a world scale, although this does not in the least preclude the possibility of defeat for individual proletarian revolutions for longer or shorter periods.


There is good reason for calling the petty-bourgeois element an element, for it is indeed something that is most amorphous, indefinite and unconscious. The petty-bourgeois Narcissuses imagine that âuniversal suffrageâ abolishes the nature of the small producer under capitalism. As a matter of fact, it helps the bourgeoisie, through the church, the press, the teachers, the police, the militarists and a thousand and one forms of economic oppression, to subordinate the scattered small producers. Ruin, want and the hard conditions of life give rise to vacillation: one day for the bourgeoisie, the next, for the proletariat. Only the steeled proletarian vanguard is capable of withstanding and overcoming this vacillation.


The events of the spring of 1921 once again revealed the role of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks: they help the vacillating petty-bourgeois element to recoil from the Bolsheviks, to cause a âshift of powerâ in favour of the capitalists and landowners. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have now learned to don the ânon-partyâ disguise. This has been fully proved. Only fools now fail to see this and understand that we must not allow ourselves to be fooled. Non-Party conferences are not a fetish. They are valuable if they help us to come closer to the impassive massesâthe millions of working people still outside politics. They are harmful if they provide a platform for the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries masquerading as ânon-partyâ men. They are helping the mutinies, and the whiteguards. The place for Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, avowed or in non-party guise, is not at a non-Party conference but in prison (or on foreign journals, side by side with the whiteguards; we were glad to let Martov go abroad). We can and must find other methods of testing the mood of the masses and coming closer to them. We suggest that those who want to play the parliamentary, constituent assembly and non-Party conference game, should go abroad; over there, by Martovâs side, they can try the charms of âdemocracyâ and ask Wrangelâs soldiers about them. We have no time for this âoppositionâ at âconferencesâ game. We are surrounded by the world bourgeoisie, who are watching for every sign of vacillation in order to bring back âtheir own menâ, and restore the landowners and the bourgeoisie. We will keep in prison the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, whether avowed or in ânon-partyâ guise.


We shall employ every means to establish closer contacts with the masses of working people untouched by politicsâexcept such means as give scope to the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the vacillations that benefit Milyukov. In particular, we shall zealously draw into Soviet work, primarily economic work, hundreds upon hundreds of non-Party people, real non-Party people from the masses, the rank and file of workers and peasants, and not those who have adopted non-party colours in order to crib Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary instructions which are so much to Milyukovâs advantage. Hundreds and thousands of non-Party people are working for us, and scores occupy very important and responsible posts. We must pay more attention to the way they work. We must do more to promote and test thousands and thousands of rank-and-file workers, to try them out systematically and persistently, and appoint hundreds of them to higher posts, if experience shows that they can fill them.


Our Communists still do not have a sufficient understanding of their real duties of administration: they should not strive to do âeverything themselvesâ, running themselves down and failing to cope with everything, undertaking twenty jobs and finishing none. They should check up on the work of scores and hundreds of assistants, arrange to have their work checked up from below, i.e., by the real masses. They should direct the work and learn from those who have the knowledge (the specialists) and the experience in organising large-scale production (the capitalists). The intelligent Communist will not be afraid to learn from the military expert, although nine-tenths of the military experts are capable of treachery at every opportunity. The wise Communist will not be afraid to learn from a capitalist (whether a big capitalist concessionaire, a commission agent, or a petty capitalist co-operator, etc.), although the capitalist is no better than the military expert. Did we not learn to catch treacherous military experts in the Red Army, to bring out the honest and conscientious, and, on the whole, to utilise thousands and tens of thousands of military experts? We are learning to do the same thing (in an unconventional way) with engineers and teachers, although we are not doing it as well as we did it in the Red Army (there Denikin and Kolchak spurred us on, compelled us to learn more quickly, diligently and intelligently). We shall also learn to do it (again in an unconventional way) with the commission agents, with the buyers working for the state, the petty capitalist co-operators, the entrepreneur concessionaires, etc.


The condition of the masses of workers and peasants needs to be improved right away. And we shall achieve this by putting new forces, including non-Party forces, to useful work. The tax in kind, and a number of measures connected with it, will facilitate this; we shall thereby cut at the economic root of the small producerâs inevitable vacillations. And we shall ruthlessly fight the political vacillations, which benefit no one but Milyukov. The waverers are many, we are few. The waverers are disunited, we are united. The waverers are not economically independent, the proletariat is. The waverers donât know their own minds: they want to do something very badly, but Milyukov wonât let them. We know what we want.


And that is why we shall win.


Conclusion


To sum up.


The tax in kind is a transition from War Communism to a regular socialist exchange of products.


The extreme ruin rendered more acute by the crop failure in 1920 has made this transition urgently necessary owing to the fact that it was impossible to restore large-scale industry rapidly.


Hence, the first thing to do is to improve the condition of the peasants. The means are the tax in kind, the development of exchange between agriculture and industry, and the development of small industry.


Exchange is freedom of trade; it is capitalism. It is useful to us inasmuch as it will help us overcome the dispersal of the small producer, and to a certain degree combat the evils of bureaucracy; to what extent this can be done will be determined by practical experience. The proletarian power is in no danger, as long as the proletariat firmly holds power in its hands, and has full control of transport and large-scale industry.


The fight against profiteering must be transformed into a fight against stealing and the evasion of state supervision, accounting and control. By means of this control we shall direct the capitalism that is to a certain extent inevitable and necessary for us into the channels of state capitalism.


The development of local initiative and independent action in encouraging exchange between agriculture and industry must be given the fullest scope at all costs. The practical experience gained must be studied; and this experience must be made as varied as possible.


We must give assistance to small industry servicing peasant farming and helping to improve it. To some extent, this assistance may be given in the form of raw materials from the state stocks. It would be most criminal to leave these raw materials unprocessed.


We must not be afraid of Communists âlearningâ from bourgeois experts, including merchants, petty capitalist co-operators and capitalists, in the same way as we learned from the military experts, though in a different form. The results of the âlearningâ must be tested only by practical experience and by doing things better than the bourgeois experts at your side; try in every way to secure an improvement in agriculture and industry, and to develop exchange between them. Do not grudge them the âtuitionâ fee: none will be too high, provided we learn something. 


Do everything to help the masses of working people, to come closer to them, and to promote from their ranks hundreds and thousands of non-Party people for the work of economic administration. As for the ânon-partyâ people who are only Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries disguised in fashionable non-party attire Ã  la Kronstadt, they should be kept safe in prison, or packed off to Berlin, to join Martov in freely enjoying all the charms of pure democracy and freely exchanging ideas with Chernov, Milyukov and the Georgian Mensheviks.

[1] Lenin began to work on The Tax in Kind pamphlet at the end of March 1921, just after the Tenth Party Congress, and finished it on April 21. He attached great importance to its earliest publication and distribution, because it explained the necessity of transition to the New Economic Policy. In early May, it was published as a pamphlet, and was soon after carried by the magazine Krasnaya Nov No. 1; it later appeared in pamphlet form in many towns, and was reprinted in part and in full in central and local papers. In 1921, it was translated into German, English and French.


A special resolution of the Central Committee instructed all regional, gubernia and uyezd Party committees to use the pamphlet to explain the New Economic Policy to the working people.

Lenin said their prevailing mood was one of intellectual scepticism, which is an expression of and a cover up for lack of principle.


The newspaper was hostile to the October Revolution and the Soviet power. From June 1, 1918, it appeared simultaneously in Moscow and Petrograd but both editions were closed down in July 1918. 


(Forward)âa daily published in Moscow from March 1917, first by the Moscow Menshevik organisation and then as the organ of the Moscow and Central Region Committees of the R.S.D.L.P. (Mensheviks), and from April 2, 1918, as the organ of the Central Committce of the Mensheviks. L. Martov, F. I. Dan and A. S. Martynov were among its editors. On May 10, 1918 it was closed down by the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) for counter-revolutionary activity and its editors were committed for trial. On May 14, the paper resumed publication under the name Vsegda Vperyod! (Always Forward!) and was finally closed down in February 1919 under an All-Russia C.E.C. decision.

[6] Oblomovâa Russian landowner from I. A. Goncharovâs eponymous novel, personifying sluggishness, stagnation and inertia.


[7] The reference is to the Plan for the Electrification of Russia worked out by a State Commission which consisted of the best scientists and specialists. It was the first long-range integrated state plan for laying the material foundation of socialism through electrification. The plan was published as a pamphlet for the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets and was approved by it.


[8] The Eighth Party Congress, held in Moscow from March 18 to 23, 1919, was attended by 301 delegates with voice and vote, and 102 with voice only. They represented 313,766 Party members.


The items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee, 2) Programme of the R.C.P.(B.); 3) Formation of the Communist International; 4) The military situation and military policy; 5) Work in the countryside; 6) Organisational questions; 7) Election to the Central Committee.


Lenin delivered the opening and closing speeches at the Congress, gave the report of the Central Committee, and the reports on the Party Programme, work in the countryside, and military policy.


The key problem before the Congress was the new Party Programme, worked out under Leninâs guidance and with his participation. The Congress approved Leninâs draft Programme, and rejected Bukharinâs anti-Bolshevik proposals.


The Congress also supported Leninâs programme on the nationalities question and rejected Pyatakovâs and Bukharinâs proposals to exclude from the Programme the paragraph on the right of nations to self-determination.


After Leninâs summing-up speech on the Party Programme, the Congress decided to âadopt the draft Programme as a wholeâ and refer it to a programme commission for final editing. The latter asked Lenin to write âThe draft Third Paragraph of the Political Section of the Programme (For the Programme Commission of the Eighth Party Congress)â, which it later adopted. On March 22, the Congress approved the final text of the Programme.


Another key problem was the attitude to the middle peasants. In his speeches, specifically in his report on work in the countryside, Lenin substantiated the Partyâs new policy: transition from the policy of neutralisation to solid alliance between the working class and the middle peasantry, based on support from the poor peasants and struggle against the kulaks, with the proletariat retaining its leadership of the alliance. Lenin first put forward the slogan in late November 1918. The Congress adopted Leninâs âResolution on the Attitude Towards the Middle Peasantryâ.


While discussing the military situation, the Partyâs military policy and Red Army organisation, the so-called Military Opposition came out against the Central Committeeâs theses (the Opposition included former âLeft CommunistsââV. M. Smirnov, G. I. Safarov, and G. L. Pyatakovâand some independents. It was also supported during the height of the Civil War, by Stalin). The Military Opposition favoured retention of some guerrilla methods, and opposed strict discipline in the army and enlistment of the services of old military specialists. Trotsky, together with Lenin, successfully isolated the Military Opposition and prevented it from damaging the war effort. At a closed plenary session on March 21, Lenin (Trotsky, and others) spoke in defence of the C.C. theses, and was supported by most of the speakers, who denounced the Military Opposition.


The C.C. theses were assumed as a basis by a majority of 174 against 95, and a co-ordination commission worked out a resolution on the military question based on Leninâs directives, which was adopted by the Congress (with only one abstention).


Leninâs ideas on the military question were incorporated in the Party Programme and served as guidance in military organisation. Trotsky, who entrusted in organising the Red Army, from 1918 onward, was Leninâs closest ally on all military and political questions as to how to fight the counter-revolution.


The resolution on the organisational question denounced the Sapronov-Osinsky group, which denied the Partyâs leadership within the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat.


The decision on Party organisation stressed the need to raise the standards for admission of non-worker and non-peasant elements into the Party, to maintain its social composition. It was decided to carry out a general registration of all Party members by May 1, 1919. The Congress rejected the federal principle of Party organisation and approved the principle of an integrated centralised Communist Party working under the guidance of a single Central Committee.


The newly elected Central Committee was headed by Lenin. The Congress welcomed the establishment of the Third (Communist) International and adopted its platform.


[9] An international association of Centrist parties and groups (temporarily made to leave the Second International by revolutionary-minded workersâ masses) called the âTwo-and-a-Half Internationalâ. It was set up in Vienna in 1921 and broke up in 1923, when it rejoined the Second International.


[10] The Menshevik Ã©migrÃ© journal, Sotsialistichesky Vestnik (Socialist Herald), was founded by L. Martov. It was published in Berlin from 1921, and later in Paris. It is now published in the United States.


The delegates sent their greetings to Lenin and invited him to the meeting. Leninâs reply was read out at the final sitting on April 20, 1921.

The Tax In Kind

      The surplus-food appropriation system has been replaced by a tax
      in kind. The All-Russia Central Executive Committee has issued a
      decree to that effect. In pursuance of this decree, the Council
      of People’s Commissars has issued a law introducing the
      tax in kind.[2] It is now the duty of all Soviet
      institutions to inform the peasants of the law as broadly as
      possible and explain what it means.

      Why was it necessary to substitute a tax in kind for the
      surplus-grain appropriation system? It is because the surplus
      appropriation system proved to be extremely inconvenient and
      onerous for the peasants, whose want and ruin were further
      aggravated by the 1920 crop failure. Furthermore, the fodder
      shortage led to greater loss of cattle; less firewood was
      transported from the forests; and there was a slowdown in the
      factories producing the goods to be exchanged for the
      peasants’ grain. The workers’ and peasants’
      government had to take steps immediately to alleviate the
      condition of the peasants.

      The tax in kind amounts to only about one-half of the
      surplus-grain appropriation rate: grain, for example, will
      amount to 240 million poods instead of 423 million. Every
      peasant will know the exact amount of tax he has to pay
      beforehand, that is, in the spring. This will reduce the abuses
      in tax collection. It will be an incentive for the peasant to
      cultivate a larger area, to improve his farm, and try to raise
      yields.

      This country has been devastated unbelievably first by the
      tsarist war, and then by the Civil War, that is, by the
      landowners’ and capitalists’ invasion against the
      Soviet power of workers and peasants. The national economy must
      be put on its feet at all costs. And the first thing to do is to
      restore, consolidate and improve peasant farming. 

    

      The tax in
      kind will help to improve peasant farming. The peasants will now
      set to work on their farms with greater confidence and with a
      will, and that is the main thing.

      Concessions And The Development Of Capitalism

      The Soviet government is inviting foreign capitalists to obtain
      concessions in Russia.

      What is a concession? It is a contract between the government
      and a capitalist who undertakes to organise or improve
      production (for example, felling and floating timber, extracting
      coal, oil, ore, etc.) and to pay the government a share of the
      product obtained, keeping the rest as his profit.

      Is it right for the Soviet government to invite foreign
      capitalists after expelling the Russian landowners and
      capitalists? Yes, it is, because, seeing that the workers’
      revolution in other countries is delayed, we have to make some
      sacrifices in order to achieve a rapid and even immediate
      improvement in the condition of the workers and peasants. The
      sacrifice is that over a number of years we shall be giving away
      to the capitalists tens of millions of poods of valuable
      products. The improvement in the condition of the workers and
      peasants is that we shall immediately obtain additional
      quantities of petroleum, paraffin oil, salt, coal, farming
      implements, and so forth. We have no right to forego the
      opportunity of immediately improving the condition of the
      workers and peasants, for our impoverishment makes it essential,
      and our sacrifices will not be fatal.

      But is it not dangerous to invite the capitalists? Does it not
      imply a development of capitalism? Yes, it does imply a
      development of capitalism, but this is not dangerous, because
      power will still be in the hands of the workers and peasants,
      and the landowners and capitalists will not

      be getting back their property. A concession is something in the
      nature of a contract of lease. The capitalist becomes, for a
      specified period, the lessee of a certain part of state property
      under a contract, but he does not become the owner. The state
      remains the owner.

      The Soviet government will see to it that the capitalist lessee
      abides by the terms of the contract, that the contract is to our
      advantage, and that, as a result, the condition of the workers
      and peasants is improved. On these terms the development of
      capitalism is not dangerous, and the workers and peasants stand
      to gain by obtaining a larger quantity of products.

      Consumers’ and Producers’ Co-Operative Societies

      Consumers’ co-operative societies are associations of
      workers and peasants for the purpose of supplying and
      distributing the goods they need. Producers’ co-operative
      societies are associations of small farmers or artisans for the
      purpose of producing and marketing products, whether
      agricultural (such as vegetables, dairy produce and the like) or
      non-agricultural (all sorts of manufactured goods, woodwork,
      ironware, leather goods, and so forth).

      The substitution of the tax in kind for the surplus
      appropriation system will give the peasants grain surpluses
      which they will freely exchange for all sorts of manufactured
      goods.

      Producers’ co-operatives will help to develop small
      industry, which will supply the peasants with greater quantities
      of necessary goods. Most of these do not have to be transported
      by rail over long distances and do not need large factories for
      their manufacture. Everything must be done to foster and develop
      producers’ co-operatives, and it is the ditty of Party and
      Soviet workers to render them every assistance, for this will
      give the peasants immediate relief and improve their
      condition. At the present time, the revival and restoration of
      the national economy of the workers.’ and peasants’
      stale depends most of all on the improvement of peasant life and
      farming.

      There must also be support and development of consumers’
      co-operative societies, for they will ensure swift, regular and
      low-cost distribution of products. It remains for the Soviet
      authorities to supervise the activity of the cooperative
      societies to see that there are no fraudulent practices, no
      concealment from the government, no abuses. In no circumstances
      should they hamper the co-operative societies but should help
      and promote them in every way.

[1]  Sixteen of
      Lenin’s speeches were recorded by the Central Periodicals
      Administration from 1919 to 1921. After the only record factory
      in Russia was restored, Lenin showed great interest in
      propaganda through records and in many ways helped to organise
      it. His first speeches were recorded in a specially equipped
      room at the Kremlin and the last, at the Central Periodicals
      Administration. Recording time was three minutes, and Lenin was
      always pleased when he managed to stay within limits. Sales ran
      to tens of thousands of records with special popularity enjoyed
      by his speeches, “On the Middle Peasants”,
      “What is the Soviet Power?”
      and “On the Tax in Kind”. The speeches published in
      this volume
      were recorded on April 25, 1921.

[2] Under a resolution
      of the Tenth Party Congress (March 21, 1921) the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee issued a decision (March 23) on the
      substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation
      system. In pursuance of that decision, the Council of
      People’s Commissars approved on March 28 and published on
      March 29 two decrees: “The Amount of the Tax in Kind for
      1921-22” and “On Free Exchange, Purchase and Sale of
      Farm Produce in Gubernias Fulfilling Appropriations”. On
      April 21 and later, the Council of People’s Commissars
      adopted decisions on the tax rate for grain, potatoes, oil seeds
      and other farm produce.

      There is still hardly any evidence of the operation of an integrated state
      economic plan. The predominating tendency is to “revive”
      everything, all branches of the national economy indiscriminately, even
      all the enterprises that we have inherited from capitalism.
    

      The State Planning Commission should organise its work in such a way as to
      have drawn up, at least by harvest time, the main principles of a state
      economic plan for the next year or two.
    

      It should start with food, for this is the taproot of all our
      difficulties. An attempt must be made to draw up a national economic plan
      for three contingencies: a state reserve of (1) 200; (2) 250 and (3) 300
      million poods of grain for the year (September 1, 1921 to
      September 1, 1922). Perhaps, if the difficulties of working out detailed
      calculations for the three contingencies prove too great, it would be more
      rational to confine ourselves to one detailed calculation based on the
      assumption that we obtain 250 million poods, with a surplus (300
      minus 250) provided against a rainy day, and only approximate the details
      for the contingency of a complete shortage of grain (200 million
      poods) (so much to be bought from abroad, so much to be
      “tightened up” in industry, transport, the army, etc.).
    

      Assume that the state grain reserve amounts to so much; deduct a reserve
      for the contingency of war, interruptions in railway communication, etc.
    

      Then comes fuel. The prospects ranging from so much to so much. Minimum
      and maximum amount of food required for this purpose. The possibility of
      increasing fuel supplies to such-and-such dimensions if the grain reserve
      is increased by so much.
    

      Possibility of economising so much fuel by concentrating production in a
      few of the best factories. These calculations are essential. In this
      connection, estimate the possibilities of economising food by closing down
      unnecessary factories, or those not absolutely essential, and by
      transferring the workers (Where? Is such transfer feasible? If
      not—consider the minimum task of putting such workers on shorter
      rations).
    

      Economising fuel by paying a bonus for saving it and by tighter
      supervision of consumption. Approximate estimate of such economy—if
      there are any data to base it on.
    

      The army (as distinct from the navy, for which special calculations must
      be made for maximum reduction, verging on abolition, and reduction of
      expenditure). Basis of calculation—1.6 million by Sept. 1, 1921, and
      a provisional estimate for half the amount.
    

      Soviet office staffs. Present size. Possibility of reducing by 25 or 50
      per cent. Bonus for one-fourth (of present number of employees, those
      absolutely essential) for reducing the total number. This question of
      giving a bonus to the remaining fourth (or third, or half) for reducing
      the total number of mouths (and for reducing fuel consumption by, say,
      introducing a three-shift system and closing two out of three offices)
      must be examined with particular care in view of its exceptional
      importance.
    

      Industry, divided into several groups with the smallest possible number of
      the main groups. Water and light. Minimum necessary to cover minimum
      requirements: α productive consumption, β individual
      consumption. Estimates for a definite number of main groups (the task of
      working out detailed calculations for the respective branches of industry,
      districts and towns may, perhaps, be assigned to special subcommissions,
      or special local agents, or to the gubernia statistical bureaus,
      etc.)— calculate how many large factories all production can be
      concentrated in, and how many should be closed. Obviously, this extremely
      important question requires particularly careful study: firstly, purely
      statistical (data for 1920, and, if possible, also for 1918 and 1919;
      sometimes, in exceptional cases, pre-war statistics may be of auxiliary
      use); secondly, economic, which must solve the following special problem:
    

      Is it possible to find for the redundant urban and industrial workers whom
      the state ought not to feed, and for whom other employment cannot be
      provided in the towns, temporary employment—for a year or
      two—in the grain districts on the understanding that they satisfy
      the needs of the surrounding farming population?
    

      After industry, from which the building industry must be singled out,
      comes transport (perhaps this should be put before industry?), and
      electrification as a distinct item.
    

      And so forth.
    

      The estimates must be first drawn up at least in rough outline, as a first
      approximation; but they must be ready at an early date—within a
      month, or two, at the outside. They must give an overall picture of the
      total food and fuel expenditure for the year. This rough plan can
      afterwards be filled in, corrected, amended; but at this early date we
      must have the main plan for the year even if only in rough outline (or
      perhaps separate plans for each of the quarters, or thirds, of the year:
      Sept. 1, 1921 to Jan. 1, 1922; Jan. 1 to May 1, and May 1 to Sept. 1,
      1922).
    

      Nineteen-twenty must be taken as a basis for comparison
      throughout. Perhaps a number of estimates can and must be made on the
      basis of a comparative statistical and economic study of the data for 1920
      and the “prospects” for 1921-22.
    

      I request that the Presidium of the State Planning Commission inform me of
      the opinions on this letter of the majority and of its individual members,
      before submitting my proposal to the Plenum of the State Planning
      Commission.
    
Chairman of the Council of Labour and Defence,

      
V. Ulyanov (Lenin )

      May 14, 1921
    
 
      P.S. 1) Special attention must be paid to the industries producing
      articles that can be exchanged for grain, in order to obtain grain within
      the country. At all events these industries must be grouped separately so
      as to provide a definite answer to the question: In the event of a general
      shortage of grain, will it be possible, by setting aside a given quantity
      of food and fuel for certain branches of industry, or certain factories,
      to obtain a given quantity of goods which can be exchanged for a given
      quantity of grain? This provisional estimate must be drawn up beforehand,
      for application, in certain cases, after the harvest.
    

      2) An attempt must be made to single out and count up: (a) the factories
      (and number of workers) that are absolutely essential for the state and
      (b) the factories—and number of workers—which are being kept
      running by tradition, routine, and the unwillingness of the workers to
      change their occupation and domicile, etc., and which should be closed
      down to rationalise production and concentrate industry in a few of the
      best factories operating in several shifts. Total number of factories and
      workers in each category. Estimate reduction of ration for second category
      as an incentive for closing these factories.

The primary task of the Soviet Republic is to restore the
    productive forces and revive agriculture, industry and transport. The ruin
    and impoverishment caused everywhere by the imperialist war are so vast
    that an economic crisis is raging throughout the world, and even in the
    advanced countries, which before the war were way ahead of Russia in their
    development and which suffered much less from the war than she did,
    economic rehabilitation is proceeding with enormous difficulty and will
    take many long years. This situation prevails even in many of the
    “victor” countries, despite the fact that they are allied with
    the richest capitalist powers and are exacting a fat tribute from the
    defeated, dependent and colonial countries.
Backward Russia, which in addition to the imperialist war endured more
    than three years of civil war, imposed upon the workers and peasants by the
    landowners and capitalists with the help of the world bourgeoisie,
    naturally finds the difficulties of economic rehabilitation so much more
    formidable. The heavy crop failure in 1920, the lack of fodder and the loss
    of cattle have had a disastrous effect on peasant farming.
In conformity with the law passed by the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee, a tax in kind has been substituted for the surplus appropriation
    system. The farmer is free to exchange his surplus produce for various
    goods. The tax rates have been announced by order of the Council of
    People’s Commissars. The tax amounts to approximately one-half of the
    produce obtained under the surplus appropriation system. The Council of
    People’s Commissars has issued a new law on the co-operative
    societies giving them wider powers in view of the free exchange of surplus
    farm produce.
These laws have done a great deal for the immediate improvement of the
    condition of peasant farming and stimulation of peasant interest in
    enlarging the area under crop and improving methods of farming and
    livestock breeding. They have also done much to help revive and develop
    small local industry which can do without the procurement and
    transportation of large state stocks of food, raw materials and fuel.
Particularly great importance now attaches to independent local
    initiative in improving peasant farming, developing industry and
    establishing exchange between agriculture and industry. Great opportunities
    are being created for the application of new forces and fresh energy to the
    work of restoring the country ‘s economy.
The Council of Labour and Defence, upon whom, in pursuance of the
    decision of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, devolves the duty of
    co-ordinating and directing the activity of the People’s
    Commissariats for the various sectors of the economy, insistently urges all
    local bodies to do their utmost to develop extensive activities for the
    all-round improvement of peasant farming and the revival of industry, in
    strict conformity with the new laws and in the light of the fundamental
    propositions and instructions given below.
We now have two main criteria of success in our work of economic
    development on a nation-wide scale. First success in the speedy, full and,
    from the state point of view, proper collection of the tax in kind; and
    second—and this is particularly important—success in the
    exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural produce between industry
    and agriculture.
This is most vital, urgent and imperative. It will put all our efforts
    to the test and lay the foundations for implementing our great
    electrification plan, which will result in the restoration of our
    large-scale industry and transport to such proportions and on such a
    technical basis that we shall overcome starvation and poverty once and for
    all.
We must collect 100 per cent of the tax in kind, and, in addition, an
    equal quantity of food products through the free exchange of surplus farm
    produce for manufactured goods. Of course, this will not be achieved
    everywhere all at once, but it should be our short-term goal. We can
    achieve it in a very short time if we take the right view of the state of
    our economy and put our hearts into reviving it the right way. All local
    authorities and bodies in every gubernia, uyezd, regional centre
    and autonomous republic must join forces and co-ordinate their efforts to
    stimulate the exchange of surplus produce. Experience will show how far we
    can do this by increasing the output and delivery of goods made by the
    state in the big socialist factories. It will show how far we succeed in
    encouraging and developing small local industry, and what part will be
    played in this by the co-operative societies and the private traders,
    manufacturers and capitalists who are under state control. We must try out
    every method, giving the utmost scope to local initiative. The new task
    before us has never been tackled anywhere else before. We are trying to
    solve it in the conditions of post-war ruin, which prevent any precise
    estimation of our resources or of the effort we can expect of the workers
    and peasants, who have made such incredible sacrifices to defeat the
    landowners and capitalists. We must be bolder in widely applying a variety
    of methods and taking different approaches, giving rein to capital and
    private trade in varying degree, without being afraid to implant some
    capitalism, as long as we succeed in stimulating exchange at once and
    thereby revive agriculture and industry. We must ascertain the country
    ‘s resources by practical experience, and determine the best way to
    improve the condition of the workers and peasants to enable us to proceed
    with the wider and more fundamental work of building up the economy and
    implementing the electrification plan.
The two main questions to which every Soviet official engaged in
    economic work must pay attention are: how much of their surplus farm
    produce, over and above the tax, have the peasants exchanged for the
    manufactures of small industry and private trade, and how much for
    manufactured goods provided by the state? These are the main lines to
    follow over the short haul in order to achieve the greatest results. They
    will provide the success indicators and enable us to decide on the
    subsequent tasks. Every aspect of economic construction in general must be
    geared to these two immediate tasks.
To attain this co-ordination, encourage local initiative, enterprise and
    large-scale operations to the utmost, and make sure that central bodies are
    guided by local experience and local supervision, and vice versa, thereby
    eliminating red tape and bureaucratic practices, the Council of Labour and
    Defence has ordered (see text of the order) that:
first, regular economic conferences should be convened in all districts
    for the purpose of co-ordinating the work .of the local departments of all
    the People’s Commissariats for the various sectors of the
    economy;
second, proper records of the local economic conferences should be kept
    to facilitate the pooling of experience and the organising of emulation,
    and mainly, to utilise the work of the local organisations and its results
    as a means of checking up on the methods and organisation of the central
    bodies.
The local economic conferences should be organised on the lines of the
    C.L.D. (Council of Labour and Defence) and their relationship with the
    local executive committees should be similar to those between the C.L.D.
    and the Council of People’s Commissars. The C.L.D. functions as a
    commission of the Council of People’s Commissars. The appointment of
    members of the Council of People’s Commissars to the C.L.D. ensures
    the fullest co-ordination of the work of both bodies, eliminates the
    possibility of any friction between them, expedites matters and simplifies
    procedures. Having no staff of its own, the C.L.D. utilises that of various
    government departments, striving to simplify their procedures and
    co-ordinate their operations.
gubernia economic councils should stand in the same
    relationship to the gubernia executive committees, and that is the
    actual trend in practice. The C.L.D., in confirming the appointment of
    members and chairmen of regional and territorial economic councils, strives
    to take account of the experience of local workers and consults with them
    on all its confirmations. The regional economic councils must certainly
    strive, and will continue to strive, to co-ordinate their work with that of
    the gubernia economic councils, securing their fullest
    co-operation, keeping them informed and stimulating their interest. This is
    hardly the time to try to reduce these relationships to a set of
    regulations, for experience is still very short and any such attempt might
    result in a purely bureaucratic exercise. It is far more appropriate to
    allow practice to determine initially the most suitable form of
    relationship (the C.L.D. worked side by side with the Council of People
    ‘s Commissars for about a year, virtually without a constitution).
    Let these forms be at first not absolutely stable: variety is desirable,
    useful and even necessary to enable us to make a more precise study and a
    fuller comparison of the various systems of relationships.
Uyezd and volost economic councils should-be organised on the
    same lines, naturally with a lot of leeway in modifying the main type, that
    is, the executive committees may assume all the functions and duties of the
    economic conferences, convert their own “executive” or
    “economic” meetings into economic conferences, appoint (say, in
    the volosts and sometimes in the uyezds) special
    committees or even individuals to exercise all or some of the functions of
    the economic conferences, and so on and so forth. The village committees
    should be the bottom rung and should operate as the lower units of the
    C.L.D. in the rural districts. The Council of People’s Commissars has
    already passed a law, issued in May 1921, which gives the village
    committees wider powers and defines their relationship with the
    village Soviets. The gubernia executive committees must draw up
    provisional regulations suitable for the given locality which, however,
    must not restrict, but give the greatest possible scope to
    “local” initiative in general, and that of the lowest units
    in particular.
In industrial uyezds and settlements, the district committees
    and factory committees, or the management boards of factories, should serve
    as the lower units of the C.L.D., depending on whether one or more branches
    of industry are being dealt with. In any case, co-operation with
    theuyezdexecutive committees, volost executive committees
    and village committees in directing all local economic life is
    absolutely essential in one form or another.
Furthermore, it is exceptionally important that local organisations
    should submit to the C.L.D. regular and precise information on their
    activity, for one of our main evils is the inadequate study of practical
    experience, inadequate exchange of experience and mutual
    control—putting orders from the centre to the test of local
    experience, and subjecting local work to control by the centre. One of the
    most important means of combating bureaucratic practices and red tape
    should be to check the way the laws and orders from the centre are carried
    out locally, and this requires the printing of public reports,
    with non-Party people and people not working in the departments
    necessarily taking a greater hand. Nashe Khozyaistvo, “the
    fortnightly journal of the Tver gubernia Economic Council”
    (No. 1, April 15, 1921; No. 2, April 30, 1921), is evidence that the local
    need to study, elucidate and publicise the results of our economic
    experience is being realised and satisfied the correct way. It will not be
    possible, of course, to publish a journal in every gubernia, not
    within the next few months, at any rate; nor will it be possible everywhere
    to have a fortnightly printing of 3,000 copies, as is the case in Tver. But
    every gubernia, and every uyezd even, can—and
    should—compile a report on local economic activities once every two
    months (or initially at longer intervals, by way of exception) and issue it
    in a printing of, say, 100 to 300 copies. The paper and the printing
    facilities for such a small operation will surely be found everywhere,
    provided we realise its urgency and importance, and see the necessity to
    satisfy this need by taking the paper from many of the departments which
    print a mass of useless and hardly urgent material. The copy could be set
    up in small type and printed in two columns (as the comrades in Tver are
    doing); the feasibility and urgency of this will be quite clear if we
    realise the simple truth that even a hundred copies, distributed one to
    every gubernia library and all the major state libraries, will
    provide a source of information for the whole of Russia, which may
    perhaps be scanty but sure, and will serve as a record of
    experience.
These reports must be published regularly, even if in small printings,
    in order to maintain a proper record of experience, and actually pool it,
    and enlist all the prominent and capable organisers among the non-Party
    people. This is something we can and must do immediately.
When drawing up the reports, the questions put must be answered as
    briefly and precisely as possible. The questions fall into four groups, the
    first being those especially prominent at the present time. They must be
    answered in every report with the maximum precision and in the greatest
    detail. That is particularly necessary because this group of questions is
    extremely vital and urgent for most uyezds at this very moment.
    Other questions will come to the fore for the smaller part of the
    uyezds and districts, that is, the purely industrial ones. The
    second group consists of questions which must also be answered in every
    report, but the answers can and should frequently be given in the form of
    brief summaries of reports already submitted to the government departments
    concerned. In all such cases, the reports to the C.L.D. must give: the
    dates on which the reports were sent off; the departments to which they
    were sent; and a brief summary of the reports in figures. The C.L.D.
    requires such reports for supervision over the various departments, as well
    as for the totals indicating the results in food supplies, fuel, industry,
    and so forth. The third group contains questions that need not be answered
    in every report. The answers to these questions must be given initially,
    that is, in the first report, but subsequent reports should add only the
    supplementary and new information as it accumulates. In many cases, there
    will be nothing to report at all on these questions every two months. The
    fourth group consists of miscellaneous, supplementary questions, which are
    not indicated in advance; they are not formulated by the centre but arise
    locally. This group must be compiled by the local bodies, and is not
    limited in any-way. It goes without saying that questions pertaining to
    state secrets (army, or such as are connected with military operations,
    security, etc.) must be answered in special reports not for publication,
    but intended exclusively for the C.L.D. as confidential reports.
Here is a list of these questions:
First Group Of Questions
1. Commodity Exchange With The Peasantry
At present, this question ranks first in importance and urgency. First,
    the state cannot carry on any economic development unless the army and the
    urban workers have regular and adequate supplies of food; the exchange of
    commodities must become the principal means of collecting foodstuffs.
    Secondly, commodity exchange is a test of the relationship between industry
    and agriculture and the foundation of all our work to create a fairly well
    regulated monetary system. All economic councils and all economic bodies
    must now concentrate on commodity exchange (which also includes the
    exchange of manufactured goods, for the manufactured goods made by
    socialist factories and exchanged for the foodstuffs produced by the
    peasants are not commodities in the politico-economic sense of the word; at
    any rate, they are not only commodities, they are no longer commodities,
    they are ceasing to be commodities).
What preparations have been made for commodity exchange? What has been
    done specifically to prepare for it? By the Commissariat for Food? By the
    co-operative societies? The number of co-operative shops available for this
    purpose? Are there such shops in every volost? In how many
    villages? Stock of goods for commodity exchange? Prices on the
    “free” market? Surplus stocks of grain and other farm produce?
    Is there any, and how much, experience in commodity exchange? Totals and
    results? What is being done to prevent the pilferage of goods stocks
    earmarked for exchange, and of food stocks (a particularly important point
    demanding investigation of every case of pilferage)?
Salt and paraffin oil as articles for commodity exchange? Textiles?
    Other goods? What items are needed most? What are the chief peasant
    shortages? What can be supplied by local, small, handicraft industry? Or by
    developing local industry?
Facts and figures showing how commodity exchange is organised and the
    results achieved are most important for the conduct of the experiment on a
    country-wide scale.
Has the proper relationship been established between the Commissariat
    for Food, the body controlling and supervising commodity exchange, and the
    co-operative societies, the bodies carrying on commodity exchange? How does
    this relationship operate in practice? In each locality?
What part does private trade play in commodity exchange? To what extent
    is private trade developing, or developed? Number of private traders; their
    turnover in the major items, particularly foodstuffs?
2. The State’s Attitude To The Capitalists
Commodity exchange and freedom of trade inevitably imply the appearance
    of capitalists and capitalist relationships. There is no reason to fear
    this. The workers’ state has enough resources to keep within the
    proper bounds and control these relationships, which are useful and
    necessary in conditions of small-scale production. The thing to do at
    present is to make a close study of their dimensions and devise suitable
    methods (not restrictive, or rather, not prohibitive) of state control and
    accountancy.
To what extent is private trade developing as a result of the
    substitution of the tax for the surplus appropriation system? Can it be
    estimated or not? Is it only profiteering or regular trade as well? Is it
    registered, and if so, what are the results?
Private enterprise: have there been any offers from capitalists and
    entrepreneurs to lease enterprises or establishments, or commercial
    premises? Exact number of such offers and an analysis of them? How are the
    results of trading operations assessed (if only approximately)? Ditto as
    regards the accounts of leaseholders and commission agents, if any?
Have there been any offers from commission agents? To buy produce for
    the state on a commission basis? Or to market and distribute it? Or to
    organise industrial enterprises?
Handicraft industry: changes since the introduction of the tax in kind?
    Extent of development? Source of information?
3. Encouragement Of Enterprise In Commodity Exchange,
     And In Economic Development In General
This question is closely bound up with the preceding one. The
    encouragement of initiative may often prove to have no connection with
    capitalist relationships. All economic councils and economic bodies in
    general should ask them- selves: how is this to be encouraged? In view of
    the novelty of the task, it is scarcely possible to issue any definite
    instructions at present. The thing is to pay great attention to the
    question, encourage all initiative in economic matters, make a careful
    study of practical experience and let the country know what is being
    done.
When the small farmer pays his tax to the state and enters into
    commodity exchange with it (with the socialist factory) the economic
    situation created imperatively demands that the state, through its local
    bodies, should give all possible encouragement to enterprise and
    initiative. The exchange of the observations and experience of local bodies
    will enable us to collect material, and later on, perhaps, to supplement
    this general and inadequate formulation of the question with a number of
    examples and detailed instructions.
4. Co-Ordination Of The Economic Work
    Of Various Departments In The Local Administrative Areas:
volosts, uyezds And gubernias
One of the great evils hindering our economic development is the absence
    of co-ordination in the work of the various local departments. Great
    attention must be devoted to this question. It is the function of the
    economic councils to eliminate this flaw and to stimulate the enterprise of
    local bodies. There must be a collection of practical examples to secure
    improvements and hold out the successful cases as a model for all. During
    the extreme food shortage, for instance, it was natural and inevitable that
    local bodies should be highly restricted in making decisions on the use of
    grain collected. As grain stocks increase, and under appropriate control,
    they must have a freer hand to do so. This can and should help to reduce
    red tape, cut down haulage of goods, encourage production and improve the
    condition of the workers and peasants. The food supply, small local
    industry, fuel, large-scale state industry, etc., are all bound up
    together, and their necessary division into “departments” for
    the purposes of state administration will cause harm unless constant
    efforts are made to co-ordinate them, remove friction, red tape,
    departmental narrow-mindedness and bureaucratic methods. The local bodies,
    which are closer to the mass of workers and peasants, have a better view of
    these defects, and it is therefore their business to devise methods of
    eliminating them by pooling their experience.
It is absolutely essential that definite, careful and detailed replies
    should be submitted to the following question: What has been done and how
    to co-ordinate the activity of the local state farms, timber
    committees,uyezdland departments, economic councils, and so
    forth?
How are officials penalised for satisfying local requirements to the
    detriment of the centre and in violation of orders from the centre? The
    names of those penalised? Is the number of such offences diminishing? Have
    the penalties been increased? If so, in what way?
5. Improvement Of The Condition Of

      
    The Workers And 6. Ditto Of The Peasants
Every success achieved in economic development improves the condition of
    the workers and peasants. But, first, here again departmental
    narrow-mindedness and the lack of co-ordination are doing a great deal of
    harm. And, second, these questions must be brought up well to the fore to
    allow a careful observation of the results achieved in this sphere. What
    exactly has been achieved? In what way? Answers to these questions are
    essential.
Weariness and in some cases downright exhaustion as a result of the long
    years of war, first the imperialist war and then the Civil War, are so
    great that it is absolutely essential to make special efforts to improve
    the condition of the workers and peasants. Very far from everything is
    being done that could and should be done, even with our meagre resources.
    By no means all the departments and agencies are concentrating on it. It is
    therefore a matter of urgent necessity to collect and study local
    experience in this field. The reports should be compiled as precisely,
    fully and carefully as possible. If that is done, it will at once become
    evident which departments lag most and where. We shall then secure an
    improvement more quickly through a common effort.
7. Increasing The Number Of

      
     Government Officials In Economic Development
It is extremely important for us to enlarge this group of workers, but
    very little systematic effort is being made to do so. Under capitalism, the
    individual proprietors strove to obtain—secretly from one another,
    and tripping each other up—the services of good salesmen, managers
    and directors. It took them decades to do this, and only a few of the best
    firms achieved good results. Today, the workers’ and peasants’
    state is the “proprietor “, and it must select the best men for
    economic development; it must select the best administrators and organisers
    on the special and general, local and national scale, doing this publicly,
    in a methodical and systematic manner and on a broad scale. Now and again
    we still see traces of the initial period of the Soviet power—the
    period of fierce civil war and intense sabotage, traces of Communists
    isolating themselves in a narrow circle of rulers, being fearful or
    incapable of enlisting the services of sufficient numbers of non-Party
    people.
We must set to work quickly and energetically to correct this. A number
    of capable and honest non-Party people are coming to the fore from the
    ranks of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, and they should be
    promoted to more important positions in economic work, with the Communists
    continuing to exercise the necessary control and guidance. Conversely, we
    must have non-Party people controlling the Communists. For this purpose,
    groups of non-Party workers and peasants, whose honesty has been tested,
    should be invited to take part, on the one hand, in the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection, and on the other, in the informal verification
    and appraisal of work, quite apart from any official appointment.
In their reports to the C.L.D., the local bodies, particularly in the
    volosts, uyezds and districts, which have the best
    knowledge of the worker and peasant masses, should give lists of non-Party
    people who have proved their honesty at work, or who have simply become
    prominent at non-Party conferences, or who command universal respect in
    their factory, village, volost, etc., and should indicate their
    assignments in economic construction. By work is meant official position as
    well as unofficial participation in control and verification, regular
    attendance at informal conferences, etc.
There must be regular replies to these questions, for otherwise the
    socialist state will be unable to organise correctly the enlistment of the
    masses in the work of economic development. There are any number of honest
    and loyal workers. There are many of them among the non-Party people, but
    we do not know them. Only local reports can help us to find them and try
    them out in wider and gradually expanding fields of work, and cure the evil
    of isolation of Communist Party cells from the masses, an evil that is in
    evidence in many places.
8. Methods And Results Of

      
    Combating Bureaucratic Practices And Red Tape
At first, most answers to this question will probably be very simple:
    methods—nil; results—nil. The decisions of the Eighth
    All-Russia Congress of Soviets have been read and forgotten.
But although the situation in this field is deplorable, we shall
    certainly not imitate those who give way to despair. We know that in Russia
    bureaucratic routine and red tape are mostly due to the low standard of
    culture and the consequences of the extreme ruin and impoverishment
    resulting from the war. This evil can be overcome only by strenuous and
    persistent effort over a long period of years. Therefore, we must not give
    way to despair, but make a new start every time, pick it up where it was
    abandoned, and try diverse ways of achieving our goal.
The reorganisation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection;
    enlistment of the services of non-Party people with and without this
    inspection; legal proceedings; reduction and careful selection of staffs;
    verification and co-ordination of the work of the various departments, and
    so on and so forth—all these measures, everything indicated in the
    decisions of the Eighth Congress of Soviets, all the measures and methods
    mentioned in the press must be systematically, steadily and repeatedly
    tried out, compared and studied.
The gubernia economic councils, and all the other bodies
    co-ordinating and directing economic development in the localities, must
    insist on the implementation of measures prescribed by the law and
    indicated by practical experience. Local experience must be pooled. Answers
    to this question must be sent in to the C.L.D., regardless of how hard it
    may be at first to teach people to give exact, full and timely answers. The
    C.L.D. will see to it that this is done. It will undoubtedly produce good
    results, even if not as quickly as is expected by those who tend to reduce
    the “combating of red tape” to a mere phrase (or to a
    repetition of whiteguard, Socialist-Revolutionary and also Menshevik,
    gossip) instead of working hard to take definite steps.
Second Group Of Questions
9. Revival Of Agriculture: A) Peasant Farming; B) State
    Farms; C) Communes; D) Artels; E) Co-Operatives; F) Other Forms Of
    Collective Farming
The briefest summaries, giving the figures of the reports sent to the
    respective departments, with the date on which each report was sent.
More detailed information—not in every report, but periodically,
    every four or six months, and so forth—on the more important aspects
    of local farming, results of surveys, the major measures adopted, and their
    verified results.
Exact information must be given at least twice a year on the number of
    collective farms (all types, b-f ), classified according to the
    degree of organisation—good, fair and unsatisfactory. A typical farm
    in each of the three groups must be described in detail at least twice a
    year, with exact data on size, location, production performance, its
    assistance to peasant farming, etc.
10. Revival Of Industry: A) Large-Scale Industry
    Entirely

      
     Controlled By The Centre; B) Large-Scale Industry

      
     Controlled Wholly Or Partly By Local Bodies; C) Small,

      
     Handicraft, Domestic, Etc., Industries
The answers should be on the same lines as those for the preceding
    section. As regards category A, the local bodies, which have opportunities
    for making a close observation of the work of large national
    establishments, their influence on the neighbouring population, and the
    attitude of the population to them, must, in every report, give information
    on these establishments, the assistance given to them by local bodies, the
    results of this assistance, the assistance rendered to the local population
    by these establishments, their most urgent requirements, defects in their
    organisation, etc.
11. Fuel: A) Firewood; B) Coal; C) Oil; D) Shale;

      
     E) Other Types Of Fuel (Waste Fuel, Etc.)
The same as for the two preceding questions: the briefest summaries,
    giving the figures of the reports sent to the respective departments and
    dates on which they were sent.
Detailed information on major points, on what is outside the scope of
    the department, on local co-ordination of work, etc.
Special attention must be paid to economising fuel. What measures are
    being taken? What are the results?
12. Food Supplies
Summary of reports to the Commissariat for Food, following the same
    rules as above.
Market gardening and suburban farming (connected with industrial
    establishments). Results.
Local experience in organising school meals, the feeding of children,
    dining-rooms, public catering in general, etc.
Bi-monthly summaries in two figures are obligatory, that is, total
    number of persons receiving food, and total quantity of foodstuffs
    distributed.
In every large consuming centre (large or medium towns, military
    institutions in special settlements, etc.) we are feeding many extra
    people, former government officials who have crept into Soviet agencies,
    bourgeois lying low, profiteers, etc. There must be a determined drive to
    sift out these superfluous mouths who are breaking the fundamental law: He
    who does not work shall not eat. For this purpose, a responsible
    statistician must be appointed in all such places to study the returns of
    the census of August 28, 1920, and current statistical returns, and submit
    a signed report on the number of extra consumers every two months.
13. Building Industry
Answers must be on the same lines as the preceding. Local initiative and
    self-reliance are particularly important in this sphere and must be given
    particularly wide scope. Detailed information on the major measures and
    results is obligatory.
14. Model And Hopeless Enterprises And Establishments
A description of every enterprise, establishment and office connected
    with economic development and meriting the designation of model, or at
    least outstanding, or successful (in the event of there being none in the
    first two categories) is obligatory. Names of the members of the management
    boards of these establishments. Their methods. Results. Attitude of the
    workers and the population.
The same as regards hopeless and useless enterprises.
Of special importance is the question of closing down enterprises that
    are not absolutely essential (hopeless ones, such as might be closed down
    and their operations transferred to a smaller number of larger enterprises,
    etc.). Statistical summary of such superfluous establishments, their number
    and the order in which the Republic should gradually dispense with
    them.
15. Improvement In Economic Work
Enumerate major and model cases of improvements introduced by inventors
    and workers of exceptional ability. Give names; enumerate experiments which
    the local bodies regard as important, and so forth.
16. Bonuses In Kind
This is one of the most important factors in socialist development. The
    enlistment of labour is one of the most important and difficult problems of
    socialism.
Practical experience in this field must be systematically collected,
    recorded and studied.
Obligatory bi-monthly reports showing how many bonuses issued, what the
    bonuses consist of, what branch of industry (separately forestry and all
    other branches of work). A comparison of the results, output, with the
    number of bonuses in kind issued?
Have there been any cases of bonuses being converted into a wage
    reserve? Report each case separately.
Have bonuses been issued to conspicuously successful enterprises and
    individual workers? Give exact details of each case.
Investigate: can a local product be obtained (for export, or one
    particularly valuable for use in Russia) by increasing the bonuses in kind
    by a given quantity? This is highly important, because if this survey is
    properly conducted across the country we shall discover many valuable
    products which we could profitably export, even if we have to import a
    certain quantity of goods for the bonuses in kind.
17. The Trade Unions. Their Part In Production
The gubernia trade union councils and theuyezdtrade
    union bodies must immediately appoint reporters and their deputies who
    must, on their own, and with the help of local statisticians, draw up
    bi-monthly reports on the subject.
As regards production propaganda, give exact facts and figures on
    lectures, meetings and demonstrations, with the names of organisers,
    etc.
But of even greater importance than production propaganda are the facts
    about the part the factory committees and the trade unions in general
    actually play in production. Forms of participation? Describe every typical
    case. Practical results. Compare establishments where the participation of
    the trade union in production is well, or fairly well, organised, with
    those where it is not.
The question of labour discipline is particularly important. Reports on
    the number of absentees are obligatory. Compare factories where labour
    discipline is bad with those where it is good.
Methods of improving labour discipline.
Comrades’ disciplinary courts. How many, and when established? How
    many cases examined per month? Results?
18. Stealing
While some organisations are aware of this widespread evil and are
    fighting it, there are others which report that “in the department,
    office or factory in our charge, there is no stealing", “everything
    is in order”.
Precise bi-monthly reports are obligatory. How many offices,
    establishments, and so forth, send in information? How many do not?
Brief summary of this information.
The measures taken to combat stealing.
Are managers, management boards, or factory committees called to account
    (for laxity in combating stealing)?
Are people searched? Are other methods of control employed; if so, what
    are they?
Is the new law on commodity exchange, and on the permission given the
    workers to retain part of their output for this purpose, having the effect
    of reducing stealing? Give precise details.
Local warehouses, that is, warehouses located in the given district, and
    belonging to the state or to the local authorities. Brief summary of the
    reports on these warehouses, giving the date on which each was sent.
Reports by the local authorities on state warehouses. Methods of
    protection. Stealing. Number of persons employed, etc.
19. Profiteering
Extent of this according to local information. Predominating type of
    profiteer. Workers? Peasants? Railway employees? Other Soviet employees?
    And so forth.
State of the railways and waterways.
Measures to combat profiteering and results obtained.
What records are being kept of profiteers and profiteering?
20. Use Of Army Units For Labour
Labour armies. Composition, numerical strength, and performance. Methods
    of accounting? Attitude of the local population?
Other forms of using army units—ditto universal military training
    units—for labour purposes.
Numerical strength of local army units—ditto local universal
    military training administration, and number of youths undergoing training
    in the units.
Concrete cases of employment of youths undergoing universal military
    training and Red Army men for definite forms of control work, sanitary
    inspection, help to the local population, various economic operations. Give
    a detailed description of each case, or if there are a number of cases give
    two typical ones: the most and the least successful.
21. Labour Service And Labour Mobilisation
How are the local departments of the People’s Commissariat for
    Labour organised? What are they doing?
Brief summaries of their reports sent to the People ‘s
    Commissariat for Labour; give date on which each report was sent.
Describe, not less than once in four months, two typical cases of labour
    mobilisation; the most and the least successful.
Enumerate purposes for which labour service was enforced. Total figures
    of the number engaged and results of work done.
What part do the local departments of the Central Statistical Board play
    in organising labour service and labour mobilisation?
Third Group Of Questions
22. Regional And Local Economic Councils
When and how were the economic councils established in the localities at
    region, gubernia,uyezdand volost level? How is
    their work co-ordinated between themselves and with the village committees,
    the factory committees?
Economic councils of district Soviets in big towns. Their composition,
    work, how is the work organised, relations with the city Soviets?
Are there any district committees and district economic councils? Are
    they necessary? Is it necessary to set up the larger factory or industrial
    settlements, with their environs, as separate areas, and so forth?
23. Gosplan (The State General Planning Commission Of The
    C.L.D.)

      
     And Its Relationships With Local Economic Bodies
Are there any regional bodies of Gosplan? Or special representatives of
    the latter? Or groups of experts acting in such a capacity?
Is the work of the local bodies co-ordinated with Gosplan’s? If
    so, how? Is such co-ordination necessary?
24. Electrification
Have the gubernia anduyezdlibraries copies of the Plan
    for the Electrification of the R.S.F.S.R., which was submitted as a report
    to the Eighth Congress of Soviets? If so, how many copies? If not, it shows
    that the local delegates to the Eighth Congress of Soviets are dishonest
    and ought to be expelled from the Party and dismissed from their
    responsible posts, or else they are idlers who should be taught to do their
    duty by a term of imprisonment (at the Eighth Congress of Soviets,
    1,500-2,000 copies were handed out for local libraries).
What measures have been taken to carry out the decision of the Eighth
    Congress of Soviets to conduct extensive propaganda of the electrification
    plan? How many articles on the subject have appeared in the local
    newspapers? How many lectures have been delivered? Number of persons
    attending these?
Have all local workers with theoretical or practical knowledge of
    electricity been mobilised for the purpose of delivering lectures on, or
    teaching, the subject? Number of such persons? How is their work being
    conducted? Are the local or nearest electric power stations utilised for
    lectures and purposes of instruction? Number of such stations?
How many educational establishments have included the electrification
    plan in their syllabus, in conformity with the decision of the Eighth
    Congress of Soviets?
Has anything practical been done towards carrying out this plan? Or any
    electrification work outside the plan? If so, what has been done?
Is there a local plan and schedule of work on electrification?

25. Commodity Exchange With Foreign Countries
It is absolutely obligatory for all border areas to answer this
    question, but not only for them. uyezds and gubernias
    adjacent to border areas also have opportunities for engaging in such
    commodity exchange and observing how it is organised. Furthermore, as
    indicated above (Point 16: Bonuses in Kind), localities even very remote
    from the border have opportunities to engage in commodity exchange with
    foreign countries.
State of the ports? Protection of the border? Volume and forms of trade?
    Brief summaries of the reports on this sent to the People’s
    Commissariat for Foreign Trade, giving the date on which each report was
    sent.
Supervision of the work of the People ‘s Commissariat for Foreign
    Trade by the local economic councils? Their opinions on practical
    organisation and results?
26. Railway, Water And Local Transport
Brief summaries of the reports sent to the appropriate department,
    giving date on which each report was sent.
State of affairs appraised from the local standpoint.
Defects in the transport system. Measures taken to improve it and their
    results?
The state of local transport facilities, and measures taken to improve
    them.
27. Press Publicity For Economic Work
Local publications and Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn. How is economic
    work treated in the press? Participation of non-Party people? Verification
    and appraisal of practical experience?
Circulation of local publications and of Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn
    ? Are they available at the libraries and accessible to the public?
Publication of pamphlets and books on economic development. Give list of
    the publications issued.
Demand for foreign literature: to what extent is it satisfied.? Are the
    publications of the Bureau of Foreign Science and Technology delivered? If
    so, what opinion is expressed about them? Other foreign publications in
    Russian and other languages?
Fourth Group Of Questions
This group should include questions chosen at the discretion of and
    suggested by the local bodies themselves, and by individuals; moreover,
    these questions may have a direct or indirect, close or remote, connection
    with economic development.
These reports must be drawn up in co-operation with the members of the
    local staffs of the Central Statistical Board. Whether this is done by
    them, or any other persons, is up to the local economic council to decide,
    but the co-operation of the gubernia statistical bureau
    anduyezdstatisticians is obligatory. Every report and every answer
    to a question, if written by different persons, must be signed by the
    author, giving his official position, if he holds one. Responsibility for
    the reports rests on the authors, and the local economic councils as a
    whole, and it shall be their duty to send in regular, punctual and truthful
    reports.
Wherever there is a shortage of local workers, courses of instruction in
    the compilation of reports must be organised under the supervision of
    statisticians and comrades, specially appointed for the purpose (from the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, and other bodies). The names
    of the persons responsible for these courses and the schedule of
    instruction must be published.

Endnotes
[1] Lenin
    worked on the draft Instructions at the same time as he was preparing a
    draft decision of the C.L.D. (Council of Labour and Defence), entitled
    “On Local Economic Meetings, Records and Reports, and Guidance by the
    C.L.D.’s Instructions”. Lenin made a thorough study of local
    documents on economic meetings and the first NEP measures. On May 20, 1921,
    the C.L.D. referred the draft Instructions and the draft decision to a
    special commission, which published the Instructions as a pamphlet because
    it was important to discuss them immediately. Members of the Presidium of
    the State Planning Commission and officials of departments and local bodies
    were invited to help edit the two drafts. On Lenin’s proposal they
    were widely discussed by the working people. On May 24, they were discussed
    by the Fourth Congress of Economic Councils. On May 25, the Fourth
    All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions instructed the newly elected All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions to consider the drafts and to insert the
    necessary amendments and addenda. The Tenth All-Russia Conference of the
    R.C.P.(B.) approved the draft Instructions, authorising the All-Russia
    C.E.C. Communist Group to take steps to got them adopted as law. On May 30,
    both drafts were discussed at the Third Session of the All-Russia Central
    Executive Committee, where Lenin delivered a speech. The session adopted
    them as a basis and referred them to a commission. Lenin introduced a
    number of editorial amendments to the C.E.C. decision, “On Local
    Economic Meetings", just before its final approval. On June 30, both drafts
    were adopted by the Presidium of the C.E.C. Because the Instructions
    defined the tasks of recording and reporting for all Commissariats and not
    only the economic ones, they were called “Instructions of the Council
    of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and
    Defence”.
Lenin believed it was highly important to give the
    working people a thorough explanation of these Instructions and put them
    into practice as soon as possible.

1. Speech In Opening The Conference May 26
Comrades, permit me to declare the All-Russia Conference of
    the R.C.P. open.
You are aware, comrades, that this conference has been convened earlier
    than is prescribed by the Rules. Consequently, it is not an ordinary, or at
    least, not quite an ordinary conference. You are also aware that the main
    item on the agenda—the main question—that has compelled us to
    convene the conference before the planned date is that of economic
    policy—the tax in kind. It is central at the present time.
I propose that we proceed to elect the presidium of the conference.
2. Report On The Tax In Kind May 26
Comrades, I had occasion to discuss, for the benefit of the
    Party, the question of the tax in kind in a pamphlet with which, I suppose,
    the majority of you are familiar. That this question has been brought up
    for discussion at a Party conference came as a surprise to me, for I had
    not seen anything to indicate that this was called for. But very many of
    the comrades who have visited the localities, notably Comrade Osinsky upon
    his return from a tour of a number of gubernias, informed the
    Central Committee—and this was corroborated by several other
    comrades—that locally the policy which had taken shape in connection
    with the tax in kind remained largely unexplained and partly even
    misunderstood. In view of its exceptional importance, additional discussion
    at a Party conference seemed so necessary that it was decided to convene
    the conference earlier than scheduled. You are aware that we in the Central
    Committee have decided to divide the report on this point into four parts,
    to be given by four rapporteurs : Kamenev, on the work of the
    co-operatives; Milyutin, on small-scale industry; Comrade Svidersky, on the
    precise calculations and proposals of the People’s Commissariat for
    Food, and the related organisational measures; the instructions and
    regulations on the tax system, partly approved, and partly to be approved
    shortly, by the Council of People’s Commissars, are of especial
    importance in this connection. Finally, Comrade Khinchuk is to be the
    fourth rapporteur ; he has been relieved of all his duties in the
    People’s Commissariat for Food to allow him to concentrate entirely
    on the co-operatives, as Chairman of Tsentrosoyuz.[Central Council of Co-operative
    Societies.—Translator.]
It has been decided, as the chief principle, that the commodity exchange
    in this case is to be handled by the People’s Commissariat for Food,
    mostly and even chiefly, through Tsentrosoyuz and the co-operatives. These
    relations between the People’s Commissariat for Food and Tsentrosoyuz
    should be formalised in an agreement, stating that all the goods available
    for exchange shall be handed over by the People’s Commissariat for
    Food to Tsentrosoyuz. This makes the latter’s role quite clear, and
    there is no need to go into it in detail. Thus, it has fallen to me to
    introduce the question of the general significance of this policy, and I
    should merely like to supplement what I have already said in the pamphlet.
    I have no direct information as to how this question is being presented in
    the localities or to the flaws, defects and unclarity that there prevail. I
    may have to elaborate certain points later on, when it becomes clearer from
    the questions that are raised at the conference, or from the subsequent
    debate, how the local officials and the Party are to be oriented.
As far as I can see, the misunderstandings and lack of clarity on the
    political tasks connected with the tax in kind and the New Economic Policy
    are perhaps due to the exaggeration of this or that aspect of the matter.
    But until we have organised this work on practical lines, these
    exaggerations are absolutely inevitable; and until we have carried out at
    least one food campaign on the new lines, it will hardly be possible at all
    to give any precise definition to the real limits for the application of
    this or that specific feature of this policy. I shall deal only in general
    outline with some of the contradictions which, as far as I could judge from
    several notes sent up at the meeting, have given rise to most
    misunderstanding. The tax in Knd and the attendant changes in our policy
    are often interpreted as a sign of a drastic reversal of policy. It is not
    surprising that this interpretation is taken up and made most of by the
    whiteguard, particularly the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik, press
    abroad. I do not know whether it is due to the operation of similar
    influences which have made themselves felt on the territory of the
    R.S.F.S.R., or to the acute discontent which was, and perhaps still is,
    evident in certain circles, owing to the extreme aggravation of the food
    situation, but this sort of perplexity may have spread to some extent even
    in this country and created what is largely a wrong conception of the
    significance of the change that has been brought about and of the character
    of the new policy.
Naturally, in view of the fact that the peasantry preponderates
    enormously among the population, the principal task—of our policy in
    general, and of our economic policy in particular—is to establish
    definite relations between the working class and the peasantry. For the
    first time in modern history we have a social system from which the
    exploiting class has been eliminated but in which there are two different
    classes—the working class and the peasantry. The enormous
    preponderance of the peasantry could not but have an effect on our economic
    policy, and our policy in general. The principal problem that still
    confronts us—and will inevitably confront us for many years to
    come—is that of establishing proper relations between these two
    classes, proper from the standpoint of abolishing classes. The enemies of
    the Soviet power discuss the formula of agreement between the working class
    and the peasantry with such frequency, and so very often use it against us,
    because it is so vague. Agreement between the working class and the
    peasantry may be taken to mean anything. Unless we assume that, from the
    working-class standpoint, an agreement is possible in principle,
    permissible, and correct only if it supports the dictatorship of the
    working class and is one of the measures aimed at the abolition of classes,
    then, of course, it remains a formula on which all the enemies of the
    Soviet-power, all the enemies of the dictatorship, operate. How is this
    agreement to be realised in the first period of our revolution, i.e., the
    period which we can now approximately consider as coming to a close? How
    was the dictatorship of the proletariat maintained and consolidated amidst
    the enormous preponderance of the peasant population? It is the Civil War
    that was the principal reason, the principal motive force, and the
    principal determinant of our agreement. Although, in many cases, the Civil
    War was started with the whiteguards, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and
    the Mensheviks jointly participating in the alliance against us, it
    invariably led to all the Socialist-Revolutionary Constituent Assembly and
    Menshevik elements finding themselves—either through a coup
    d’etat or otherwise—driven into the background, which left
    the capitalist and landowner elements to head the whiteguard movement. That
    was the case under Kolchak and Denikin, and all the numerous smaller
    regimes and during campaigns against us. It was the principal factor that
    determined the form of the alliance between the proletariat and the
    peasantry. This circumstance multiplied our incredible difficulties, but
    upon the other hand, it spared us the necessity of racking our brains over
    how to apply the alliance formula, for it and the conditions of its
    realisation were both dictated by the circumstances of war, leaving us no
    choice whatsoever.
Only the working class could exercise the dictatorship in the form
    demanded by the Civil War and its conditions. The participation of the
    landowners in this war united the working class and the peasantry
    absolutely, unreservedly and irrevocably. In that respect there was no
    internal political wavering whatsoever. Amidst the gigantic difficulties
    that confronted us because Russia was cut off from her principal grain
    areas and food hardships had been aggravated to the extreme, we could not
    have carried out our food policy in practice without the appropriation of
    surplus grain. This meant taking not only the surplus stocks of grain,
    which would hardly have sufficed even if they had been properly
    distributed. I cannot here deal in detail with the irregularities which the
    system brought in its train. At all events, it served its main
    purpose—keeping industry going even when we were almost completely
    cut off from the grain districts. But this could have been at all
    satisfactory only in conditions of war. As soon as we had finally done away
    with the external enemy—and this became a fact only in
    1921—another task confronted us, the task of establishing an
    economic alliance between the working class and the peasantry. It
    was only in the spring of 1921 that we actually got down to this task, and
    that was when the 1920 crop failure had worsened the condition of the
    peasantry to an incredible degree, and when we first witnessed some
    internal political wavering, which did not result from external enemy
    pressure, but from the relations between the working class and the
    peasantry. If wehad had a very good, or at least a good, harvest in 1920,
    if the surplus appropriations had yielded 400 million out of the planned
    420 million poods of grain, we would have been able to fulfil the
    greater part of our industrial programme and would have had a stock of
    manufactured urban goods to exchange for agricultural produce. But the
    opposite happened. A fuel crisis, even more acute than the food crisis,
    developed in some places and it was utterly impossible to satisfy the needs
    of the peasant farms in urban manufactures. Peasant farming was gripped by
    an incredibly acute crisis. Those were the circumstances that suggested
    that we could not possibly continue with the old food policy. We had to
    bring up the question of what economic basis we required immediately for
    the alliance between the working class and the peasantry as a stepping
    stone to further measures.
The stepping stone is to prepare the exchange of industrial goods for
    agricultural produce; to create a system under which the peasant would not
    have to surrender his produce otherwise than in exchange for urban and
    factory-made goods, but which would not subordinate him to any of the forms
    existing under the capitalist system. In view of the prevailing economic
    conditions, however, we could not even think about that. That is why we
    have adopted the transitional form I have spoken about, namely, to take
    produce in the form of a tax without giving any equivalent, and to obtain
    additional produce through the medium of exchange. But this requires an
    appropriate fund; ours is extremely small, and the possibility of
    augmenting it through foreign trade has arisen only this year, as a result
    of a number of agreements with capitalist countries. It is true that these
    are as yet a mere introduction, a foreword; no real trade has yet begun.
    There is continued sabotage and all sorts of attempts to disrupt these
    agreements by most or the greater part of the capitalist circles, and the
    most characteristic thing is that the Russian whiteguard press, including
    the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press, is hammering away at these
    agreements with more venom than at anything else. It is absolutely clear
    that the bourgeoisie is better prepared for the fight, that it is more
    developed than the proletariat, that its class-consciousness has been given
    a keener edge by all the “trouble” it has had to put up with,
    and that it is betraying an abnormal sensitiveness. A close look at the
    whiteguard press will show that it is hitting out at the very point that is
    the centre, the pivot, of our policy.
After the failure of the military invasion, which has quite obviously
    collapsed, although the struggle is still on, the whole of the whiteguard
    Russian press has set itself an unattainable aim: to tear up the trade
    agreements. The campaign which was started this spring on an extremely
    extensive scale, with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the
    forefront of the counter-revolutionary forces, had a definite aim—to
    tear up the economic agreements between Russia and the capitalist world by
    this spring; and to a considerable extent they succeeded in achieving their
    aim. It is true that we have concluded the principal agreements—their
    number is increasing—and we are overcoming the growing resistance to
    them. But there has been a very dangerous delay; for, without some
    assistance from abroad, rehabilitation of large-scale industry and
    restoration of regular exchange of commodities will either be impossible or
    will mean very dangerous delay. These are the conditions in which we are
    obliged to act, and these are the conditions which for the peasants have
    brought the question of restoring trade to the forefront. I shall not deal
    with the question of concessions, because it has been debated most at Party
    meetings, and has not lately given rise to any perplexity. The position is
    that we are continuing our assiduous offers of concessions, but the foreign
    capitalists have not yet received a single sizable concession, and we have
    not yet concluded any really serious concessions agreement. The whole
    difficulty lies in finding a way of enlisting West-European capital that
    has been tested in practice.
Theoretically, it is absolutely indisputable—and it seems to me
    that everyone ‘s doubts on this score have been
    dispelled—theoretically, I say, it is absolutely clear that it would
    be to our advantage to pay off European capital with a few score or
    hundreds of millions, which we could give it in order to augment, in the
    shortest possible time, our stocks of equipment, materials, raw materials
    and machinery for the purpose of restoring our large-scale industry.
Large-scale industry is the one and only real basis upon which we can
    multiply our resources and build a socialist society. Without large
    factories, such as capitalism has created, without highly developed
    large-scale industry, socialism is impossible anywhere; still less is it
    possible in a peasant country, and we in Russia have a far more concrete
    knowledge of this than before; so that instead of speaking about restoring
    large-scale industry in some indefinite and abstract way, we now speak of
    the definite, precisely calculated and concrete plan of electrification. We
    have a precise plan projected by the best Russian specialists and
    scientists, a plan which gives us a definite picture of the resources,
    considering Russia’s natural features, with which we can, must and
    will lay the basis of large-scale industry for our economy. Without it, no
    real socialist foundation for our economic life is possible. This remains
    absolutely indisputable, and if, in connection with the tax in kind, we
    have lately spoken about it in abstract terms, we must now say definitely
    that we must first of all restore large-scale industry. I myself have heard
    statements of this kind from several comrades, and all I could do in reply
    was, of course, to shrug my shoulders. It is absolutely ridiculous and
    absurd to assume that we could ever lose sight of this fundamental aim. The
    only question that arises here is: how could such doubts and perplexity
    arise in the minds of comrades, and how could they think that this key
    task, without which the material production basis of socialism is
    impossible, has been pushed into the background? These comrades must have
    misunderstood the relation between our state and small industry. Our main
    task is to restore large-scale industry, but in order to approach this task
    at all seriously and systematically we must restore small industry. Both
    this year, 1921, and last year, we had great gaps in our efforts to restore
    large-scale industry.
In the autumn and winter of 1920 we started several important branches
    of our large-scale industry, but we had to suspend them again. Why? Many
    factories were able to obtain enough manpower and sufficient supplies of
    raw materials; why then was work at these factories suspended? Because we
    were short of food and fuel. Without a state reserve of 400 million
    poods of grain (I take an approximate figure) backed up by regular
    monthly allotments, it is difficult to talk about any sort of regular
    economic development or of restoring large-scale industry. Without it we
    find that after having started work on restoring large-scale industry and
    continuing it for several months we have had to suspend it again. Most of
    the few factories that were started are now idle. Without fully assured and
    adequate food stocks the state cannot concentrate on systematically
    organising the rehabilitation of large-scale industry, organising it on a
    modest scale, perhaps, but in such a way as to keep it going
    continuously.
As regards fuel, until the Donbas is restored, and until we obtain a
    regular supply of oil, we shall have to continue to rely on timber, on
    firewood, which again means dependence on small-scale production.
That explains the mistake of those comrades who failed to understand why
    it is the peasant who must now be placed in the centre of things. Some
    workers say: the peasants are being favoured, but we get nothing. I have
    heard such talk, but I must say I think it is not very widespread, for such
    talk is dangerous, because it echoes the Socialist-Revolutionaries. It is
    an obvious political provocation; and is, besides, a survival of
    craft—not class—but craft-union prejudices of workers, when the
    working class regards itself a part of equitable capitalist society and
    fails to realise that it still stands on the old capitalist basis. These
    workers say, in fact: the peasant is being favoured, he has been relieved
    of surplus-grain appropriation, he is allowed to retain his grain surplus
    for the purpose of exchange; we workers at the bench want to have the same
    thing.
What is at the bottom of this point of view? It is, in essence, the old
    petty-bourgeois ideology: since the peasants are a component part of
    capitalist society, the working class also remains a component part of this
    society; hence, if the peasant trades, we too must trade. Here we
    undoubtedly see a revival of the old prejudices which grapple the worker to
    the old world. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are the most
    ardent and, in fact, the only sincere, champions of the old capitalist
    world. You will find none among the hundreds, the thousands, and even the
    hundreds of thousands in all the other camps. But these rare specimens
    remain among the so-called pure democrats, whom the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks represent. And the more
    persistently they advocate their views, the more dangerous is their
    influence over the working class. They are doubly dangerous when the
    working class has to go through periods of suspended production. The
    principal material basis for the development of proletarian
    class-consciousness is large-scale industry, where the worker sees the
    factories running, and daily feels the power that can really abolish
    classes.
When the workers lose their footing in this material production basis,
    some of them are beset by a sense of instability, uncertainty, despair and
    skepticism, and this has a definite effect when combined with outright
    provocations by our bourgeois democrats, i.e., the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. This produces a mentality which
    makes people, even in the ranks of the Communist Party, reason in this way:
    the peasants were given a handout; for the same reasons, and by the same
    methods, a handout should be given to the workers. We have had to yield to
    this mentality to some extent. The decree on bonuses to workers in the form
    of a part of the goods they produce is, of course, a concession to these
    sentiments, which have their roots in the past and are engendered by
    skepticism and despair. Within certain small limits, this concession was
    necessary. It has been made. But we must not for a moment forget that we
    have been making a concession that is necessary from no other standpoint
    but the economic one: the interests of the proletariat. Its basic and most
    vital interests are bound up with the rehabilitation of large-scale
    industry as a solid economic foundation. When that is done, it will
    consolidate its dictatorship, it will be sure to carry its dictatorship to
    success, in the teeth of all the political and military difficulties. Why,
    then, were we obliged to make a concession, and why would it be extremely
    dangerous to give it a wider interpretation than it deserves? It is only
    because temporary food and fuel difficulties compelled us to take this
    path.
What is the principal economic determinant of the policy when we say,
    “We must not base our relations with the peasants on surplus-grain
    appropriation but on a tax"? It is that under the surplus-grain
    appropriation system the small peasant farms have no proper economic basis
    and are doomed to remain dead for many years. Small farming cannot exist
    and develop, because the petty farmer loses interest in consolidating and
    developing his activity and in increasing his output, all of which leaves
    us without an economic basis. We have no other basis or source, and unless
    the state is able to accumulate large stocks of food it is no use thinking
    about the rehabilitation of large-scale industry. That is why we are first
    of all applying this policy which is changing our food relations.
We are conducting this policy so as to have a fund for the
    rehabilitation of large-scale industry; to relieve the working class from
    all interruption of work, which should not be experienced even by our
    large-scale industry, miserable though it is when compared with that of the
    advanced colmtries; to relieve the proletarian of the need to find the
    means of subsistence by resorting to the petty-bourgeois method of
    profiteering, which is not a proletarian method and threatens us with the
    gravest economic dangers. Owing to our present deplorable conditions,
    proletarians are obliged to earn a living by methods which are not
    proletarian and are not connected with large-scale industry. They are
    obliged to procure goods by petty-bourgeois profiteering methods, either by
    stealing, or by making them for themselves in a publicly-owned factory, in
    order to barter them for agricultural produce—and that is the main
    economic danger, jeopardising the existence of the Soviet system. The
    proletariat must now exercise its dictatorship in such a way as to have a
    sense of security as a class, with a firm footing. But the ground is
    slipping from under its feet. Instead of large, continuously running
    factories, the proletarian sees something quite different, and is compelled
    to enter the economic sphere as a profiteer, or as a small producer.
We must spare no sacrifice in this transitional period to save the
    proletariat from this. To ensure the continuous, if slow, rehabilitation of
    large-scale industry we must not hesitate to throw sops to the greedy
    foreign capitalists, because, from the standpoint of building socialism, it
    is at present to our advantage to overpay the foreign capitalists some
    hundreds of millions in order to obtain the machines and materials for the
    rehabilitation of large-scale industry, which will restore the economic
    basis of the proletariat, and will transform it into a steadfast
    proletariat, instead of one engaged in profiteering. The Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries have deafened us with their shouts that since the
    proletariat has been declassed, we ought to abandon the tasks of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. They have been shouting that since 1917,
    and the surprising thing is that they have not grown tired of shouting it
    up to 1921. But when we hear these attacks we do not say that there has
    been no declassing, and that there are no flaws. What we say is that
    Russian and international realities are such that even though the
    proletariat has to go through a period when it is declassed, and has to
    suffer from these handicaps, it can nevertheless fulfil its task of winning
    and holding political power.
It would be absurd and ridiculous to deny that the fact that the
    proletariat is declassed is a handicap. By 1921, we realised that after the
    struggle against the external enemy, the main danger and the greatest evil
    confronting us was our inability to ensure the continuous operation of the
    few remaining large enterprises. This is the main thing. Without such an
    economic basis, the working class cannot firmly hold political power. In
    order to ensure the continued rehabilitation of large-scale industry we
    must organise the food supply in such a way as to collect and properly
    distribute a fund of, say, 400 million poods. It would be utterly
    impossible for us to collect it through the old surplus-grain appropriation
    system: 1920 and 1921 are proof of this. Now we see that we can nonetheless
    fulfil this extremely difficult task by means of the tax in kind. We cannot
    fulfil it with the old methods, and so we must try some new ones. It can be
    done by means of the tax in kind and by establishing proper relations with
    the peasant as a small producer. We have devoted considerable effort to
    prove this theoretically.
I think, judging by the Party press and by what is being said at
    meetings, that it has been fully proved theoretically that this task can be
    fulfilled if the proletariat retains possession of the transport system,
    the big factories, the economic basis as well as political power. We must
    give the peasant a fair amount of leeway as a small producer. Unless we
    revive peasant farming we shall not solve the food problem.
It is within this framework that we must deal with the question of
    developing small industry on the basis oI unrestricted trade and free
    turnover. This free turnover is a means to establish economically stable
    relations between the working class and the peasantry. We now have more and
    more precise data on agricultural output. A pamphlet on grain output was
    distributed at the Party Congress; it was still in proofs when it was
    distributed to the delegates. Since then the material contained in it has
    been supplemented and circulated. The pamphlet in its final form has now
    been sent to the press, but it is not yet ready for the conference, and I
    am unable to say whether it will be ready before the conference comes to a
    close and the delegates disperse. We shall do all we can to get it out in
    time, but we cannot promise to do so.
This is a small part of our effort to determine, as precisely as
    possible, the position in regard to agricultural output, and the resources
    at our disposal.
Still, we can say that there is evidence that we are quite able to solve
    this economic problem, particularly this year, when the harvest prospects
    are not too bad, or not as bad as we anticipated in spring. This assures us
    of the possibility of accumulating an agricultural reserve that will enable
    us to devote ourselves entirely to the task of steadily, even if slowly,
    restoring our large-scale industry.
In order to solve the problem of accumulating food stocks for industry
    we must devise a form of relations with the peasant, the small proprietor,
    and there is no other form except that of the tax in kind; no one has come
    up with another form, and one can be imagined. But we must have a practical
    solution of this problem: we must arrange to have the tax collected in a
    proper manner, and not in the old way, when grain was taken two or three
    times, leaving the peasant in a worse plight than ever, inflicting the most
    suffering on the more industrious and destroying every possibility of
    establishing economically stable relations. The tax in kind, while also a
    levy on every peasant, must be collected in a different way. On the basis
    of the collected and published data we can say that the tax in kind will
    now bring about a crucial change, but whether it will cover everything is
    still, to some extent, an open question. Of one thing we can be quite
    certain, however, and it is that we must bring about an immediate
    improvement in the condition of the peasant.
The task that confronts the local workers is to collect the tax in kind
    in full, and do so in the shortest possible time. The difficulties are
    increased by the fact that the harvest promises to be an unusually early
    one this year, and if our preparations are based on the customary dates, we
    run the risk of being too late. That is why the early convocation of the
    Party conference was important and opportune. We must work more quickly
    than before to prepare the apparatus for collecting the tax in kind. The
    accumulation of a minimum state fund of 240 million poods of grain
    and the possibility of making the position of the peasant secure depend on
    the speed with which the tax in kind is collected. Delay in collecting it
    will cause a certain amount of inconvenience to the peasant. The tax will
    not be paid voluntarily, we shall not be able to dispense with coercion,
    for the levy imposes some restrictions on the peasant farm. If we drag out
    the process of collecting the tax, the peasant will be discontent and will
    say that he is not free to dispose of his surplus. If the freedom is to be
    such in practice, the tax must be collected quickly; the tax-collector must
    not hover over the peasant for long, and so the period between the
    harvesting and the collection of the tax in full must be reduced to a
    minimum.
That is one task. The other is to maximise the peasant’s freedom
    of trade and the revival of small-scale industry, so as to allow some
    leeway to the capitalism that grows up on the basis of small private
    property and petty trade. We should not be afraid of it, for it is not
    dangerous to us in the least.
We need not fear it at all in view of the general economic and political
    situation that has now arisen, with the proletariat controlling all the
    sources of large-scale production, and denationalisation in any shape or
    form entirely out of the question. At a time when we are suffering most of
    all from a severe shortage of goods and utter impoverishment, it is
    ridiculous to fear the threat of capitalism based on small commercial
    agriculture. To fear it is to fail altogether to take account of the
    relation of forces in our economy. It means to fail to understand that the
    peasant economy, as a small-scale peasant economy, cannot be stable at all
    without some free exchange and the attendant capitalist relations.
This is what you must firmly impress on your minds, comrades. And our
    main task is to give a push to the comrades in all the localities, to give
    them the utmost scope for initiative, to stimulate them to display the
    utmost self-reliance and boldness. In this respect we are still suffering
    from the fear of doing things on a really wide scale. We have no more or
    less definitely tabulated local data showing from practical experience what
    the situation is in regard to local goods exchange and trade, what success
    has been achieved in restoring and developing small industry—which
    can alleviate the condition of the peasant right away, without the great
    effort of transporting large stocks of food and fuel to the industrial
    centres that large-scale industry entails. From the general economic
    standpoint, not enough is being done locally in this respect. We have no
    information on this from the localities, we do not know what the position
    is all over the Republic, we have no examples of really well-organised
    work; and my impression is that the Trade Union Congress and the Congress
    of the Supreme Economic Council[2] have none either.
Here again, the principal defect of these congresses is that we devote
    ourselves mainly to such threadbare things as theses, general programmes
    and arguments, instead of giving the participants a chance to swap local
    experience and say, on returning home: “Out of a thousand examples we
    heard one good one, and we shall follow it.” Actually, we have not
    only one good example in a thousand, we have many more; but least of all do
    we see congress work arranged in this way.
I have no wish to forestall events, but I must say a word or two about
    collective supplies for the workers, i.e., about the proposal to substitute
    for the ration system a system under which certain factories that are
    actually in operation will be assured of a certain quantity of food in
    proportion to their output. The idea is an excellent one, but we have
    turned it into something semi-fantastic, without however doing any real
    preparatory work for it. We have no example as yet of any particular
    factory, even one employing a small number of workers, in a particular
    uyzed, having tried out this system and having secured
    such-and-such results. That is something we do not as yet have, and it is
    one of the greatest drawbacks in our work. We must keep repeating that
    instead of discussing general problems, which was all very well in 1918,
    i.e., in the long distant past, we must, in this 1921, discuss practical
    problems. By telling congresses first of all about the examples of
    well-organised work—there are quite enough of them—we would
    make it an obligation for the rest to strive to imitate the best that has
    been achieved in a few rare and exceptional localities. I have in mind the
    work of the Trade Union Congress, but it also applies to all work connected
    with the food problem.
Quite a lot has been done in some cases, in a few localities, to prepare
    for the collection of the tax in kind, the organisation of trade, etc., but
    we have not managed to study this experience; and the great task that
    confronts us now is to induce the vast majority of the localities to follow
    the example of the best. Our task now is to study practical experience and
    raise the backward and medium uyzeds and volosts, the
    standard of which is absolutely unsatisfactory, to the level of the
    insignificant number of highly satisfactory ones. At our congresses we must
    shift our main attention from the study of general theses and programmes of
    meetings to the study of practical experience, to the study of the examples
    set by the satisfactory and highly satisfactory districts, and to raising
    the backward and medium ones, which predominate, to the level of these good
    ones, which may be few but are still there.
Those are the remarks to which I must confine myself.
    (Applause.)
3. Summing-Up Speech On The Tax In Kind May 27
Comrades, although many comrades from the provinces have expressed
    dissatisfaction with the reports and the debate, it seems to me that we
    have, at any rate, achieved one object—we have ascertained how the
    new policy is understood and applied locally. The conference could hardly
    have set itself any other aim than that of securing an exchange of opinion
    for the purpose of thoroughly assimilating this new policy and of
    unanimously proceeding to its proper application. This we have achieved.
    True, there has been some perplexity and even wavering, which,
    unfortunately, in some cases, went far beyond perplexity over practical
    questions and conjectures about whether the new policy was meant
    “seriously” or “notseriously", and for how long. What
    Comrade Vareikis said, for example, was really not communist at all, and in
    content smacked of Menshevism. I must say this quite bluntly. How could he
    keep asking: “Tell us, is the peasantry a class, or not a
    class?” Of course, it is a class. In that case, he says, it must have
    political concessions, or, if not that, then certain measures should be
    taken in that direction, which will resemble Zubatovism[3] just the
    same.
Reference was made here to the fact that Martov had put the case
    squarely, whereas Vareikis was adding: “To a certain extent",
    “to some degree", “partly". This caused incredible, monstrous
    confusion. It is the same sort of confusion that was displayed when we were
    being accused of employing force. Again we have to explain that when we
    speak of dictatorship we mean the employment of coercion. Every-state
    implies employment of coercion; but the whole difference lies in whether it
    is employed against the exploited or against the exploiters. Is it employed
    against the toiling and exploited class? The same applies to the reference
    to Zubatovism. What was Zubatovism? It was support for the oppressor class
    by means of small economic concessions to the oppressed classes. That is
    why the response at that time was: economic concessions will not help you
    to induce the proletariat, the class that is fighting for the emancipation
    of all the oppressed, to abandon the idea of capturing political power and
    of destroying the system of oppression. At present the proletariat holds
    power and guides the state. It guides the peasantry. What does that mean?
    It means, first, pursuing a course towards the abolition of classes, and
    not towards the small producer. If we strayed from this bedrock course we
    should cease to be socialists and would find ourselves in the camp of the
    petty bourgeoisie, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who are
    now the proletariat’s most bitter enemies. Not long ago Comrade
    Bukharin quoted in Pravda some utterances of such a serious
    political thinker as Milyukov (Chernov and Martov come nowhere near him),
    who argued that only a socialist party could occupy the arena of political
    struggle in Russia today. And since the “socialist” parties,
    the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, desire to take the
    trouble of fighting the Bolsheviks, they “are welcome to try". That
    is literally what Milyukov said, and it proves that he is cleverer than
    Martov and Chernov, simply because he is a representative of the big
    bourgeoisie (even if he personally had less brains than Chernov and
    Martov). Milyukov is right. He takes a very sober account of the stages of
    political development and says that Socialist-Revolutionism and Menshevism
    are the necessary stepping stones leading to a reversion to capitalism. The
    bourgeoisie needs such stepping stones, and whoever does not understand
    this is stupid.
From the standpoint of the interests of the bourgeoisie, Milyukov is
    absolutely right. Since we, being the party of the proletariat, are leading
    the peasantry, we must pursue a course towards strengthening large-scale
    industry, and must therefore be prepared to make economic concessions. The
    proletariat led the peasantry, and did it in such a way that during the
    Civil War the peasantry obtained more economic benefits than the
    proletariat. In Martov’s terms, this is Zubatovism. Economic
    concessions have been made to the peasantry. These concessions were made to
    a section of the working people constituting the majority of the
    population. Is this policy wrong? No, it is the only correct one! And no
    matter what you say about Martov’s catchwords, about it heing
    impossible to deceive a class, I ask you nevertheless: where is our
    deception? We say that there are two paths to choose: one following Martov
    and Chernov—and through them to Milyukov—and the other
    following the Communists. As for us, we are fighting for the abolition of
    capitalism and the establishment of communism. Ours is a very hard road,
    and many are weary and lack faith. The peasants lack faith. But are we
    deceiving them? It is ridiculous to say that we are deceiving a class, and
    have lost our way amidst three pines, or even two, for the working class
    and the peasantry are only two classes. The proletariat leads the
    peasantry, which is a class that cannot be driven out as the landowners and
    capitalists were driven out and destroyed. We must remould it by prolonged
    and persistent effort, entailing great privation. It depends on us, the
    ruling party, how much of the suffering will fall to the lot of the
    proletariat and how much to that of the peasantry. How is this suffering to
    be shared? Is it to be on a basis of equality? Let Chernov and Martov say
    that. We say that we must be guided by the interests of the proletariat,
    that is, we must obtain safeguards against the restoration of capitalism
    and ensure the road to communism. Since the peasantry is now wearier and
    more exhausted, or rather it thinks that it is so, we make more concessions
    to it in order to obtain safeguards against the restoration of capitalism
    and to ensure the road to communism. That is the correct policy, and we are
    guided exclusively by class considerations. We tell the peasants frankly
    and honestly, without any deception: in order to hold the road to
    socialism, we are making a number of concessions to you, comrade peasants,
    but only within the stated limits and to the stated extent; and, of course,
    we ourselves shall be the judge of the limits and the extent. The
    concession itself is being made with an eye to distributing the burdens
    which, up to now, the proletariat has borne to a larger extent than the
    peasantry. During the three and a half years of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, it has voluntarily borne more hardships than the peasantry.
    This is an absolutely obvious and incontrovertible truth. This is how the
    question stands in regard to the relations between the proletariat, and the
    peasantry: either the peasantry comes to an agreement with us and we make
    economic concessions to it—or we fight. That is why all other
    arguments are but evidence of a terrible confusion. As a matter of fact,
    any other road leads to Milyukov, and the restoration of the landowners and
    capitalists. We say that we shall agree to make any concession within the
    limits of what will sustain and strengthen the power of the proletariat,
    which, in spite of all difficulties and obstacles, is unswervingly
    advancing towards the abolition of classes and towards communism.
The next point is that much of the criticism of Comrade
    Svidersky’s speech was wrong. All the members of the opposition at
    once hurled themselves upon him with what might be called brilliant
    parliamentary speeches, Comrade Larin proving to be the most brilliant
    representative of the “parliamentary opposition". The Soviet system
    does not provide many opportunities for making parliamentary speeches; but
    nature asserts herself, and although we have no parliamentary institutions,
    the parliamentary manner survives. Concerning Comrade Svidersky they
    complained that he had proposed the introduction of a food supply
    inspectorate, and had even gone to the length of talking about a food
    dictatorship. Comrade Svidersky may have overstated his case, but he is
    right in substance. We distributed the reporters’ roles in such a way
    that each played on a different instrument, as it were. The report on the
    question of exchange was made by the representative of Tsentrosoyuz,
    Comrade Khinchuk—the co-operator. As you are well aware, Tsentrosoyuz
    has concluded an agreement with the state. If some of the comrades have not
    read it, this only goes to show that they have not treated the material of
    the conference in a business-like way. Our state concludes an agreement
    with the representative of Tsentrosoyuz: the representative of the
    People’s Commissariat for Food concludes an agreement with the
    representative of the co-operative societies, and co-operators abroad must
    reckon with our agreement. Under the agreement all goods are delivered to
    the co-operative societies, so that the co-operators may trade on our
    behalf—on behalf of the centralised state, the big factories, and the
    proletariat—but not on their own behalf. This is a major and most
    important condition, because there can be no other arrangement. Petrograd
    and Moscow are starving, while the well-fed gubernias, as Comrade
    Bryukhanov’s figures show, have eaten twice as much, and sent us half
    as much as they should have. What do you say: in the circumstances, do we
    or do we not need a food dictatorship? I think we do; we need it very much,
    indeed, because there is any amount of this laxity all over the country.
    You must realise that we cannot do without coercion, and Tsentrosoyuz must
    do the distributing under our control.
We say to Tsentrosoyuz: you have traded well and we will give you a
    bonus in the form of a definite percentage. This is stipulated in the
    agreement, and we will encourage this commission-basis trading by every
    sort of bonus system. We will give a bonus for profitable trade; but we
    will demand that this trade is carried on for our benefit, for the benefit
    of the state, which has centralised large-scale industry, and which is
    governed by the proletariat. Does large-scale industry stand to gain? Who
    stands to gain?
How can you ensure food supplies without a tax? You cannot. We do not
    know whether the tax or the exchange will yield most, but we do
    know—and it is a fact—that we lack an adequate fund for
    exchange. At the present time, you cannot get what you need without an
    instrument of coercion. Never! This is obvious. And in this, Svidersky, as
    a representative of his line, is absolutely right. We have approved of the
    establishment of a food supply inspectorate, and the Presidium of the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee will bring more pressure to bear on
    you because you know who ought to be appointed; that is your business; but
    once you make the appointment, see that the man does his job. Things being
    what they are, unless the state is assured of approximately 400 million
    poods of grain, it is no use talking about large-scale industry
    and socialist construction. Those who have not learned this in the course
    of the past three years are not worth arguing with. But in spite of our
    numerous mistakes, we have increased this fund. True, while increasing the
    fund in 1920, we blundered over distribution, but enormous progress was
    made nonetheless. We must approach the subject soberly and say that to
    collect the tax in kind we need an expeditious apparatus, and it is no use
    making liberal speeches and hinting that a food supply inspectorate is such
    a nasty thing.
I am not aware of the existence of a “communist” system
    under which you could expect to collect—without coercion—a tax
    from the peasantry constituting a majority of the population in the period
    of transition from capitalism to communism. If you want to sustain
    large-scale industry—the basis of the proletarian
    dictatorship—then you must want this apparatus to function. And this,
    naturally, demands centralism. Look at the figures. Unfortunately, few of
    you are sufficiently familiar with them. See how much the localities have
    kept for themselves, in spite of the orders from the centre. The comrades
    from Moscow and Petrograd have quoted figures here showing that the orders
    from the centre are not being fully carried out. It turns out that three
    reminders were given, and an equal number of censures. What else is there
    to do? There remains nothing but dismissal, arrest and so forth. (A
    voice : “How many such cases were there?") There were many cases
    of infringements, but few dismissals. That is what I wanted to say in
    defence of this line of policy.
The harvest this year will evidently be a fair one in many parts, and
    will set in earlier than we expected. Hence, we must make preparations
    beforehand, the situation now being such that we must swiftly collect the
    main fund. Consequently, it is absolutely wrong to take the approach that
    many did here.
As for Comrade Larin, his talents lie more in the sphere of
    parliamentary opposition and journalism than business efficiency. He is
    tireless in the drawing-up of projects. He mentioned that he had proposed a
    good plan as early as January 1920, but if we were to collect all of his
    projects and pick out the good ones, we would probably find that they add
    up to one in ten thousand.
On May 10, he submitted a scheme to the Central Committee’s
    Political Bureau for a general introduction of a collective supply system.
    Its main principle is alluring, but when was it proposed? On May 10, 1921,
    when there was an absolute shortage of food in centres like Moscow and
    Petrograd, when these important centres of the Russian Republic were
    temporarily doomed to semi-starvation and even worse. It is ridiculous to
    propose a reshuffle of the food supply organisations at a time when men are
    on their last legs, and are overworking the trunk-lines to Siberia, the
    Caucasus and the Ukraine, in an effort to track down every trainload, every
    car almost. What the devil is the use of introducing a collective supply
    system at a time like that? The Political Bureau adopted the following
    resolution: “That the scheme proposed by Larin and the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions [the A.C.C.T.U., of course, hastened to put
    its signature to it] be rejected; that the author of the scheme be
    instructed to re-examine the question with greater care, in the light of
    the actual possibilities of obtaining supplies. . . .” This principle
    was reiterated (in Chubar’s and Holtzmann’s theses, if you have
    read them) at the Trade Union Congress; Chubar had formulated the main
    parts of his theses in harmony with the policy of circumspection laid down
    by the Party’s Central Committee. Holtzmann and Larin behaved
    according to the rule which Larin, half in jest, whispered in my ear at the
    end of the meeting of the Political Bureau. (I don’t think I shall be
    committing an indiscretion if I relate this conversation.) When Larin saw
    that the resolution had been adopted he said to me: “You have given
    us your little finger, but we will take your hand.” Then I said to
    myself—although I had known it before—now we know how to
    bargain with Larin. If he asks for a million rubles, offer him fifty
    kopeks. (Laughter.) During the debate, when Larin was asked for
    the facts, he quoted the example (which he said was “brilliant") of
    the construction of the Kizlyar-Staro-Terek railway. Although it has
    already been shown that there is nothing new in this example, that similar
    experiments have been made before, it is a sign of progress to hear
    definite examples and results of experience, instead of general arguments
    and countless theses, It would be disastrous if everyone began reading and
    discussing these theses, nine-tenths of which you cannot read to the end
    without a splitting headache.
It is not theses, but a record of local experience, that we need. Let us
    study this experience, instead of piling system upon system and drawing up
    laws on collective supplies when we lack even the minimum of real supplies.
    Practical work is going on in the localities. We were told: it is not right
    to reproach the localities for not sharing their experiences. The Central
    Committee was reproached here for not giving publicity to local experience.
    But we have none of it: our time is taken up entirely with decrees. The
    majority of us are immersed in this unpleasant work, and that is why we
    cannot see local experience. It is your business to bring it to us. Larin
    was right in quoting the fine example of the Kizlyar-Terek railway, for it
    was a piece of local experience. But even here he allowed his imagination
    to run away with him, and Chubar and Osinsky had to put him right. This is
    not the only example. He said that a worker received 28 pounds under the
    old system and four poods under the new system. I was doubtful
    about the figures and so I asked him: Where did you get that from? He
    replied that they had been certified by the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection. But we know that Larin is not only a
    parliamentary man, but also a cartoonist. First, he drew a cartoon
    satirising the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. And now he
    says: four poods instead of 28 pounds—certified by the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. First, he undermines
    confidence in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection by relating
    anecdotes of that kind, and then presents the certificate of the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection as sole proof. Chubar and
    Osinsky say that this system has been repeatedly employed in the timber
    industry. The whole point is to compare the experience of one locality with
    that of another. The best part of Larin’s statement was his
    description of the work on the Kizlyar-Terek railway. But what we need to
    know is whether things have not been done better in Tula or Tambov. The
    centre cannot tell you that, because we do not know. You should bring us
    this information from the localities, show us the facts, teach us, and we
    will all learn, and try to follow the best example.
The number of local centres, on the uyed or district level,
    with such experience is two or three per thousand, possibly more, but
    surely two or three can be found. This experience must be thoroughly
    studied in a business-like fashion. We must carefully sift the evidence and
    verify the figures, and not rely merely on speeches by the opposition. If
    we do this, the centre will be able to learn.
I think the most important outcome of the debate has been the
    information we got on how the exchange of commodities was begun; the only
    thing lacking was the precise facts. Donbas comrades cabled to say: We have
    obtained 3,000 poods of wheat through exchange. This referred to a
    small district, but there were no details. I expected the comrades to come
    forward here and tell us what they gave in return, and through what
    organisation the exchange was made: the Commissariat for Food, a lessee,
    concessionaire or private entrepreneur? This we do not know; and yet it is
    far more important than our decrees. Decrees can be read, and it is hardly
    worth getting together to discuss them; but it is certainly worth while to
    come together to discuss how they obtained 3,000 poods of wheat in
    the Donbas, and whether the comrades in Volhynia or Tambov have not done
    better. Quite a good deal has been done locally. The comrades should come
    here and tell us the results of their practical experience over there. One
    will say: “I started doing so and so, but was hindered by the central
    organisation.” Another will say: “I managed to bring the
    central organisation to heel.” As for Tambov Gubernia, the comrade
    who delivered a parliamentary speech and thundered against the Commissariat
    for Food vaguely hinted that they had set up co-operative shops and
    agencies. The comrades had accepted this. Over there they have to put up
    with a number of additional difficulties; part of the area has not been
    sown, severe conditions generally, handicap upon handicap. Nevertheless,
    from what he said it is evident that exchange has begun and the
    co-operatives are functioning. Even pomade was mentioned. How much pomade
    did you take? And on what terms was it distributed? You must even trade in
    pomade; when you are trading you must reckon with the demand. If there is a
    demand for pomade, we must supply it. If we run things properly we can
    restore large-scale industry even with the aid of pomade. What we must
    calculate, though, is how much of it we need to buy, or obtain, to be able
    to purchase 1,000 poods of grain. (Voice : What about
    icons; there’s a demand for icons.) As for icons, someone has just
    given a reminder that the peasants are asking for icons. I think that we
    should not follow the example of the capitalist countries and put vodka and
    other intoxicants on the market, because, profitable though they are, they
    will lead us back to capitalism and not forward to communism; but there is
    no such danger in pomade. (Laughter.) As for church bells, we
    differ on that, and some comrades think that in some places the bells will
    soon be voluntarily recast into copper wire for electrification. Besides,
    there are so many of them in Russia at the moment that they can hardly be
    used by religious people for their original purpose, because the need is no
    longer there. As regards Volhynia, it was stated that there are places
    there where they give a pood of grain for ten pounds of salt. But
    how was this transacted? Did you have any agents? How did you trade? Who
    looked after the goods? Who locked up the warehouses? How much was stolen?
    That is the main thing but nothing was said about it at all. Instead, we
    were told that the Poles had given a pood of salt for a
    pood of grain. In conversation with the comrade I said that if the
    Poles offered a pood of salt for a pood of grain and the
    peasants offered you a pood of grain for ten pounds of salt, then
    you could have traded something for yourselves. What prevented you from
    doing that? The centre, it was said. I’m sorry but I simply cannot
    believe that the centre prevented you from obtaining four poods of
    grain for a pood of Polish salt. We could not have opposed a thing
    like that; I refuse to believe it. The comrades complained that before,
    when the army was there, everything had to be done through the military
    authorities; but now that the army is no longer there and there is no war,
    permission must be obtained from the centre. A comrade said that now they
    had the Southern Paper Trust and that they were fighting this Trust. But
    when I asked to whom they had complained about this organisation he
    answered that he did not know. But this is very important.
They were unable to name the body to whom they had sent their complaint
    about the Southern Paper Trust. I do not know what this Paper Trust is. In
    all probability it is a body that suffers from the same bureaucratic
    distortion that all our Soviet organisations are afflicted with. The
    capitalists are still fighting us. We have compelled many of them to seek
    protection under Milyukov’s wing abroad; but many thousands are still
    here, waging war against us according to all the rules of the art of
    bureaucracy. But how are you combating this, comrades? Do you think you can
    take this Paper Trust and all the rest of them with your bare hands? We did
    not fight Denikin with bare hands, but armed ourselves strongly, and
    organised an army. But here we have excellent officials, who consider that
    it is in the interests of their class to play dirty tricks on us, to hamper
    our work; they think that they are saving civilisation by helping to bring
    about the downfall of the Bolsheviks, and they know how to run an office a
    hundred times better than we do. There was nowhere for us to learn this
    business. We must fight them according to all the rules of the art and take
    proceedings against Party comrades who go about lodging complaints, or
    telling anecdotes about the dirty tricks that are being played in some
    office or other. They go about Moscow telling anecdotes about the
    bureaucratic tricks that are being played. But you, comrades, who are
    intelligent Communists, what have you done to combat this?—"I lodged
    a complaint."—Where did you file your complaint? It turns out that no
    complaint had been filed, whereas it should have been sent to the Council
    of People’s Commissars and to the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee; in other words, they should have exercised all their rights
    provided for by our Constitution. Of course, we may suffer a reverse here
    and there in this war. But has there ever been a war, even the most
    victorious, without any reverses? In this one reverses are also possible,
    but the fight must go on. Many of us, however, are not taking it seriously.
    Have you taken legal proceedings against those who are responsible for red
    tape? Has any people’s court convicted anyone for making a worker or
    a peasant call at an office four or five times and finally sending him off
    with an answer which is formally correct, but is essentially sheer mockery?
    You are Communists, aren’t you? Then why don’t you set a trap
    for these bureaucratic gentlemen and then haul them before a people’s
    court, and into prison, for this red tape? How many people have you put
    into prison for red tape? Everyone will say, of course, that it is a
    troublesome business: Someone may be offended. Many take this view, but do
    not find it too much trouble to complain and tell anecdotes. Very often one
    cannot tell the difference between these anecdotes and the slander
    published by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in foreign
    journals. The Mensheviks write: “We have our own correspondents in
    all the Soviet offices in Moscow.” (Laughter.) Quite often
    the anecdotes that are told here, and those with which the speeches of the
    parliamentary opposition are replete, appear in the Menshevik journals a
    few days later. But you should know where to draw the line; you must see
    the difference between a serious struggle and the telling of anecdotes. Of
    course, when people are tired, an anecdote told by a capable speaker may
    help to let off steam. Judging from my own observations this is so, and I
    have no objections from this point of view. But we need something more: we
    must study the methods used to catch the culprits, count up how many were
    caught and brought to trial, and sum up the results obtained. If we proceed
    on these lines we will win this war, although it takes far more skill than
    the Civil War.
I should like to say a word or two about Nikolayev Gubernia. The comrade
    from Nikolayev Gubernia gave us a number of valuable facts, but in most
    cases he gave no details. He said: “There is a demand for textiles
    and iron, but not for pomade.” Others said, however, that there was
    no demand for textiles. The comrade came up against the profiteers, and
    being obliged to pursue the free market policy, he wants to know how to
    combat them. We cannot fight them in the old way; and to fight them in the
    new way we have mounted guards in the transport system, and a number of new
    decrees have been passed; but, of course, no quick results can be expected.
    But where is your local experience in this matter? A number of decrees have
    now been passed for the protection of the transport system, not against the
    profiteers, but against its “improper use". Special commissions,
    Extraordinary Three-Man Commissions have been set up by the Cheka and the
    Transport Cheka; the War Department and the People’s Commissariat for
    Railways are also taking a hand. But what are the bodies functioning in
    your districts? How do they co-ordinate their work? What is being done
    about the complaints that the profiteers are getting the upper hand? How do
    they operate? This is what we ought to discuss. But comrades come here and
    complain: “The profiteers have got the upper hand.” We have
    adopted the decrees. Perhaps they are no good, they must be put to the
    test, but how is this to be done? We test our decrees by publishing them.
    You know them; you come here to discuss them and tell us how they are
    applied. You must tell us: in such and such a place, such and such a
    Transport Three-Man Commission has done the following. In one place it was
    successful, in another it was not. Perhaps the speeches will not be as
    brilliant as those we heard about the food dictatorship; but unless we do
    this we shall never learn to make fewer mistakes in drafting decrees, and
    that is the main thing.
Let me deal in conclusion with the deductions which, I think, Comrade
    Osinsky has quite rightly drawn, and which sum up our activities. His
    deductions were three. First: “Seriously and for a long time". I
    think he is quite right. The policy is a long-term one and is being adopted
    in earnest. We must get this well into our heads and remember it, because,
    owing to the gossip habit, rumours are being spread that we are indulging
    in a policy of expedients, that is to say, political trickery, and that
    what is being done is only for the present day. That is not true. We are
    taking class relationships into account and have our eyes on what the
    proletariat must do to lead the peasantry in the direction of communism in
    spite of everything. Of course, we have to retreat; but we must take it
    very seriously and look at it from the standpoint of class forces. To
    regard it as a trick is to imitate the philistines, the petty bourgeoisie,
    who are alive and kicking not only outside the Communist Party. But I would
    not go along with Comrade Osinsky in his estimate of the period. He said
    “seriously and for a longtime” meant 25 years. I am not that
    pessimistic; I shall refrain from estimating the period, but I think his
    figure is a bit too pessimistic. We shall be lucky to project our policy
    for some 5 or 10 years, because we usually fail to do so even for 5
    weeks.
We must promote enterprising non-Party workers. We must reiterate over
    and over again that, after all is said and done, meetings, congresses and
    conferences held by the Communist Party and other organisations in Soviet
    Russia must not be what they have been in the past, and still are, that is
    to say, assemblies with speeches in the spirit of parliamentary oppositions
    and the drawing up of resolutions. We have so many resolutions that nobody
    even takes the trouble to file them, let alone read them. We must devote
    our attention to business and not to resolutions. Under the bourgeois
    system, business matters were managed by private owners and not by state
    agencies; but now, business matters are our common concern. These are the
    politics that interest us most. Of course, we can denounce the Mensheviks
    for the 999th time, they deserve it; but after all is said and done, this
    is mere repetition, and many of us have now been doing it these thirty
    years. Most of us have had enough of it.
What is much more interesting is how, in this socialist state, we are to
    exchange textiles, pomade and other things for grain, and obtain an extra
    pood of flour in exchange for Polish salt. Although it is not our
    custom, Party meetings must take up the question of enterprise and
    initiative. The whole capitalist world is starving. They have an abundance
    of salt, pomades, and other things of that sort, and if we apply the slogan
    of local exchange properly and show initiative, we shall obtain extra
    poods of grain.
Comrade Gusev has handed me a draft of the rules and regulations for a
    Communist Producers’ Co-operative Society. Its substance is contained
    in Point 5, in which the members of the society ask to be assured a
    “healthy, hygienic ration". (Laughter.) A “healthy,
    hygienic ration” is the goal of our whole food policy. We must
    collect 240 million poods of grain by means of the tax, and 160
    million through commodity exchange, making a total of 400 million
    poods, so that the peasants may feel that this system is
    economically stable.
The surplus-grain appropriation system could not be continued any
    longer. The policy had to be changed. In this respect, we are facing what
    is, perhaps, the most difficult period of our construction effort. If we
    were to compare the whole work of the Communist Party to a four-year course
    in the higher sciences, we could say that our present position is as
    follows: we are taking our examination to pass from the third course to the
    fourth; we have not yet passed the examination, but there is every sign
    that we shall. We can say that the first course lasted from the 1870s to
    1903; it was the initial introductory period, ranging from Narodnaya Volya,
    Social-Democracy and the Second International to Bolshevism. That was the
    first course.
The second course lasted from 1903 to 1917, with a serious preparatory
    course for revolution, and the first essay in revolution in 1905. The third
    course lasted from 1917 to 1921, a period of four years, which in content
    was more important than the first forty years. This was a very practical
    test, when the proletariat came to power, but it was not yet the crucial
    test. Although in our anthem we sing: “The last fight let us face", I
    must say that, unfortunately, it was not the last fight, but one of the
    fights just before the last, to be absolutely exact. At present we are
    taking our examination to pass from the third course to the fourth. Taking
    Osinsky’s example of years, I think we should allow ten, because we
    shall have to take an exam to pass from the third course to the fourth.
    After that we must do well in the fourth course and then we shall really be
    invincible. We can win on the economic front. If we are victorious in
    relation to the peasantry and collect a “healthy, hygienic
    ration” this year, we shall pass to the fourth course. After that,
    all the work of construction that we are planning will be more serious.
This is the task confronting us. That is why I take the liberty, once
    again, in conclusion to express the hope that, in spite of the
    difficulties, and all the old traditions which frown on the idea of
    discussing local questions of minor economics at congresses, conferences
    and fine parliamentary assemblies, we shall, nevertheless, say to
    ourselves: being Communists, we shall have to devote ourselves to these
    tasks. We must study the practical experience gained in economic work in
    the localities, where the decrees are being applied, where they are tested,
    where their defects should be rectified, where we must begin to do the
    things that are later summed up at our meetings. If we do that, our work of
    construction will make real and durable progress. (Stormy
    applause.)
4. Draft Resolution On Questions Of The New Economic
    Policy
1. The fundamental political task of the moment is for all Party and
    Soviet workers to gain a complete understanding of the New Economic Policy
    and to implement it to the letter.
The Party regards this policy as being established for a long period of
    years, and demands that everyone should carry it out unconditionally with
    thoroughness and diligence.
2. Commodity exchange is brought to the fore as the principal lever of
    the New Economic Policy. It is impossible to establish a correct
    relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry, or an altogether
    stable form of economic alliance between these two classes in the period of
    transition from capitalism to socialism, without regular commodity exchange
    or the exchange of products between industry and agriculture.
The exchange of commodities, in particular, is required to stimulate the
    extension of the peasants’ area under crop and improvement of peasant
    farming.
Local initiative and enterprise must be given all-round support and
    development at all costs.
gubernias with the greatest grain surpluses must be placed on
    the priority list for commodity exchange.
3. Considering co-operatives to be the main apparatus for commodity
    exchange, the conference recognises as correct the policy of contracts
    between the agencies of the People’s Commissariat for Food and the
    co-operative societies, and the transfer, under government control, by the
    former to the latter of commodity-exchange stocks to fulfil the assignments
    of the government;
the co-operatives to be given broad opportunities for procurement and
    all-round development of local industry and revival of economic life in
    general;
support for credit operations by the co-operatives;
anarchic commodity exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control
    and state supervision) to be combated by concentration of exchange chiefly
    in the hands of the co-operatives, without, however, any restrictions on
    regular free market operations;
market analysis.
4. Support for small and medium (private and co operative) enterprises,
    chiefly those not requiring supplies from state raw material, fuel and food
    reserves.
Permission to lease government enterprises to private persons,
    co-operatives, artels and associations. The right of local economic
    agencies to conclude such contracts without authorisation from superior
    agencies. Obligatory notification of the Council of Labour and Defence in
    each such case.
5. Review of (certain sections of) production programmes for large-scale
    industry towards increasing the manufacture of consumer goods and peasant
    household articles.
Extension of enterprise and initiative by each large establishment in
    the disposal of financial and material resources. Submission of a precise

5. Speech In Closing The Conference May 28
Comrades, I think that I can confine myself to a very short speech. As
    you are aware, we convened this special conference mainly for the purpose
    of achieving complete understanding on economic policy between the centre
    and the localities, among Party and all Soviet workers. I think that the
    conference has fully achieved its object. Some speakers noted that Comrade
    Osinsky gave the correct expression to the feelings of very many, probably,
    the majority of local Party workers when he said that we must remove all
    doubt about the fact that the policy adopted by the Tenth Party Congress
    and subsequently reinforced by decrees and orders has unquestionably been
    accepted by the Party in earnest and for a long time. This is what the
    conference most emphatically expressed and amplified by a number of points.
    When the comrades return to their localities, not the slightest possibility
    of wrong interpretation will remain. Of course, in adopting a policy to be
    pursued over a number of years we do not for a moment forget that
    everything may be altered by the international revolution, its rate of
    development and the circumstances accompanying it. The current
    international situation is such that some sort of a temporary, unstable
    equilibrium, but equilibrium for all that, has been established; it is the
    kind of equilibrium under which the imperialist powers have been compelled
    to abandon their desire to hurl themselves at Soviet Russia, despite their
    hatred for her, because the disintegration of the capitalist world is
    steadily progressing, unity is steadily diminishing, while the onslaught of
    the forces of the oppressed colonies, which have a population of over a
    thousand million, is increasing from year to year, month to month, and even
    week to week. But we can make no conjectures on this score. We are now
    exercising our main influence on the international revolution through our
    economic policy. The working people of all countries without exception and
    without exaggeration are looking to the Soviet Russian Republic. This much
    has been achieved. The capitalists cannot hush up or conceal anything. That
    is why they so eagerly catch at our every economic mistake and weakness.
    The struggle in this field has now become global. Once we solve this
    problem, we shall have certainly and finally won on an international scale.
    That is why for us questions of economic development become of absolutely
    exceptional importance. On this front, we must achieve victory by a steady
    rise and progress which must be gradual and necessarily slow. I think that
    as a result of the work of our conference we shall certainly achieve this
    goal. (Applause.)

[1] An
    extraordinary conference, held in Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921, was
    attended by 239 delegates from Party and Soviet organisations. On its
    agenda were the following questions: 1) Economic policy: a) tax in kind; b)
    co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) The current role
    of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, 3) The Third Congress of
    the Comintern; 4) Information on the Fourth Trade Union Congress; 5)
    Organisational question.
The Conference centred on the question of the New
    Economic Policy (NEP) because it was not yet clear enough to the people in
    the localities.
Lenin guided the work of the Conference: he delivered
    the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, was elected to the Presidium, gave
    a report and a summing-up speech on the tax in kind, and the closing speech
    of the Conference. Substantiating the New Economic Policy, he exposed the
    false rumours about NEP and distortions of this policy, and stressed that
    it was a policy whose aim was the construction of a socialist society, that
    it was to be carried out “in earnest and for a long time". The
    Conference adopted Lenin’s draft resolution, “On Economic
    Policy", which confirmed NEP’s basic principles and gave concrete
    instructions for their implementation. It said: “The basic political
    task of the moment is for all Party and Soviet workers to master and
    implement to the letter the New Economic Policy. See K.P.S.S. v
    rezolutsiakh . . . (The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions
    of Congresses, Conferences and C.C. Plenary Meetings, Part 1,
    1954, p. 574).
After the Conference had heard information on the work
    of the Fourth Trade Union Congress, Lenin sharply criticised the factional
    activity of the trade union leadership, first and foremost M. P. Tomsky,
    Chairman of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions.
Another question of great importance was the
    organisational work of the Party, the report on which was given by V. M.
    Molotov. The Conference adopted a “Plan for the Work of the Central
    Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)” which demanded the training and
    promotion of new Party workers and activisation of all Party and Soviet
    work. Lenin stressed that Party organisations had to establish closer ties
    with the non-Party masses and that it was necessary to collect and study
    the experience of local Party organisations. His remarks were taken into
    account in the resolution.
Representatives of the Communist Parties of Germany and
    the United States conveyed greetings to the Conference, and, on the motion
    of the Presidium, the Conference cabled a message of greetings to workers
    detained in prison.
[2] The
    reference is to the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions, held in
    Moscow from May 17 to 25, 1921, and the Fourth All-Russia Congress of
    Economic Councils, held there from May 18 to 24, 1921.
The Fourth Congress of Trade Unions had the following
    items on its agenda: report of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade
    Unions; report of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council the role
    and tasks of the trade unions and economic development organisational
    question; wage-rate policy and workers’ supply; trade unions and
    co-operatives; labour protection, etc.
The Fourth Congress of Economic Councils had on its
    agenda: report of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council, economic
    policy of the S.E.C. in connection with the decree on the tax in kind and
    the co-operatives, S.E.C. organisation, report of the State Planning
    Commission; report on foreign trade; electrification of Russia; material
    resources of the Republic and organisation of supply in industry.
The most important questions were discussed at joint
    sittings of the two congresses with the participation of specialists and
    public figures.
[3] Colonel of
    the gendarmerie Zubatov, Chief of the Secret Political Police, proposed the
    setting up of legal workers’ organisations in 1901-03 to divert the
    workers from political struggle against the tsarist autocracy, and to
    switch their attention to narrow economic demands which the government, he
    asserted, was ready to meet. The Minister for the Interior, V. K. Plehve,
    approved Zubatov’s activity and the first organisation, called
    “Workers’ mutual aid in mechanical industries society", was set
    up in Moscow in May 1901, and later such societies made their appearance in
    Minsk, Odessa, Vilno, Kiev, and other towns.
The Second Coneress of the R.S.D.L.P., in its resolution
    “On the Trade Union Struggle", defined Zubatovism as a policy of
    “systematic betrayal of working class interests for the benefit of
    the capitalists", and in order to fight it, called on Party organisations
    to support and lead any strikes started by legal workers’
    organisations.
Revolutionary Social-Democrats made use of such
    organisations to draw the masses of working people into the struggle
    against the tsarist government, exposing the reactionary nature of
    Zubatov’s policy. Lenin wrote in 1905: “And now the Zubatov
    movement is outgrowing its bounds. Initiated by the police in the interests
    of the police, in the interests of supporting the autocracy and
    demoralising the political consciousness of the workers, this movement is
    turning against the autocracy and is becoming an outbreak of the
    proletarian class struggle.”
The tsarist government had to close down the Zubatov
    organisations in 1903 because of the mounting revolutionary movement.
Lenin believed it was highly important to give the
    working people a thorough explanation of these Instructions and put them
    into practice as soon as possible.

      Comrades, I have very little to add to what Comrade Osinsky has said, for
      he has already explained the preliminary draft of the Instructions, copies
      of which you have, and the main idea underlying it. As there are details
      in this matter which virtually determine the whole issue, it was decided
      not to limit its examination to the Council of Labour and Defence and the
      Council of People’s Commissars, but to bring it before the Party
      conference, where the Instructions were approved in principle, and before
      the supreme legislative body-the Session of the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee. Local workers must make a careful verification of the
      methods by which this law is to be implemented, and it may be necessary at
      first to lay down a number of supplementary rules.
    

      Care must be taken that this measure is not, in any circumstances,
      converted into just another source of increased red tape. This would not
      be unlikely if we were to receive too many reports, or if the methods of
      compiling them did not guarantee that they could be checked. Comrades, we
      must give thought to the methods of compiling the reports, and you may
      find it appropriate to elect a special commission which, guided by the
      suggestions that will be made here and the instructions and directives you
      give it, will put the matter of the reports into final shape. We already
      have a fair amount of material on this question. Naturally, if reports are
      to be submitted, they must come not only from the various economic bodies,
      but also from the People’s Commissariats, that is, including those
      which do not run branches of the economy but are nevertheless closely
      connected with economic work. One of the main objects of printing the
      reports is to bring them within reach of the non-Party masses, and of the
      population in general. We cannot use mass production methods and print
      these reports in large numbers, and so we must concentrate them in the
      libraries. That being the case, we must arrange for brief printed
      summaries of these reports, giving the gist of what is of most interest to
      the population. The technical facilities for this are available. Before
      coming here to speak I made inquiries of the representative of the Central
      Paper Board. He has sent me a precise report covering 339 uyezd centres,
      and showing that each of those has the printing facilities and the paper
      to print very brief reports. He has based his calculations on the
      assumption that the smallest of these uyezd centres would print 16 pages
      in octavo, once a month, of course. But once a month is too often. Whether
      you decide on once in two months, or in four, or perhaps even a longer
      period, will evidently be determined by the reports we get from the
      localities. He has assumed that there would be 1,000 copies, and has
      accordingly estimated that the required quantity of paper is now
      available. A thousand copies would enable us to supply these reports at
      least to every uyezd library and so bring them within the reach of all who
      are interested in them, particularly the masses of non-Party people. Of
      course, this will initially have to be an experiment; no one can guarantee
      that it will be successful at once, and that there will be no defects.
    

      To conclude my brief supplementary remarks I should like to emphasise one
      other thing. One of the most important tasks confronting us at present is
      that of massive enlistment of non-Party people for this work, ensuring
      that apart from Party members and in any case officials of the department
      concerned, the largest possible number of non-Party people should have an
      interest in the work and be enlisted in it. It appeared to us that this
      could net he achieved in any way except by publishing the reports, at any
      rate, the more essential part of them. Some establishments send in
      extremely full reports. All the information that we have had on this
      question up to now shows that some local bodies are excellently
      organised. At all events, the work in the localities is constantly
      providing us with a great deal of very encouraging material. What we
      really lack is the ability to publicise the best examples-which are not
      many and set them up as models which all should be obliged to emulate. Our
      press does not publicise these really exemplary local organisations which
      have practical experience. Printing these reports and bringing them within
      the reach of the broad masses of the population, by supplying copies to
      every library, if only on the uyezd level, should help provided
      conferences of non-Party people are properly convened-to enlist far
      greater numbers in the economic drive. Any number of resolutions have been
      passed on this subject, lit some places, something has been done, but
      taking the country as a whole, certainly far too little is being done. By
      this method, however, we shall improve the work of the establishments and
      make it possible for every local worker in every responsible economic post
      to provide the centre with signed reports containing precise and definite
      information on his practical experience, which could he used as a
      model. This seems to he what we lack most at the present time.
    

      Let us leave it to practice to decide how these reports are subsequently
      to be summarised and studied, and utilised at conferences, congresses and
      by establishments. Considering the available experience of local workers,
      the main thing now is to approve this decree and put it to the test and be
      sure to obtain results by the forthcoming All-Russia Congress (some time
      next December) which would show just how this measure could be developed,
      improved, modified and enlarged on the basis of experience.
    

      These are the brief supplementary remarks that I should like to confine
      myself to for the time being.

      Comrades, first of all permit me to greet your conference on
      behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars and of the
      Central Committee of the R.C.P.

      Comrades, we all understand, of course, why such special
      attention should be paid to your conference-, not only by those
      who are engaged in food supply work, but by all Soviet and Party
      workers, by the whole Party, and by all those who are at all
      seriously concerned about the fate of the Soviet Republic and
      its tasks. Your conference has met at a moment of exceptional
      importance, and for that reason it cannot possibly be regarded
      as an ordinary, or regular food conference, like any you have
      attended in the past, and will no doubt attend again in the
      future.

      The exceptional importance of your present conference is due to
      two circumstances. The first is an unavoidable one-what we
      feared-the fact that for the second year our country is
      afflicted by a disaster that entails grave hardships. We do not
      know whether we are in for a long cycle of drought, as has been
      predicted these two years, but it is now clear that the grain
      and hay crop will fail in a large area of the country for the
      second year running, and the prospects are menacing. I will not
      say just now how large is the area which, according to the grain
      and hay crop reports, is affected by the drought; at all events,
      it is considerable. Whatever it is, the prospect is that in many
      gubernias there will he a large deficit in the tax in
      kind, and, moreover, the condition of the population in a number
      of gubernias will be desperate; so that, instead of
      collecting  a certain quantity of surplus produce from these
      gubernias for the maintenance of the army, the working
      class and industry, the food supply workers will have to assist
      the starving in these gubernias. The unanticipated
      tasks which thus devolve upon you, as food supply workers, will
      make your work much more arduous. This is the first
      circumstance.

      The second circumstance, which is not as unexpected, is the
      moment of change, the turning point that has been reached, in
      our whole food policy. This is the first food campaign to be
      launched since the radical change in our food policy. This is
      the first time we have met to sum up the experience of local
      food supply workers and to prepare for our forthcoming tasks
      since the Soviet government was obliged to change, not only its
      food policy but, in many respects, the very principles of its
      economic policy; since the extremely severe hardships the
      peasants suffered last year, and the impossibility, as it turned
      out, of rapidly restoring large-scale industry, compelled us to
      switch all our state work to new lines.

      Reckoning with the gravity of the situation in the country and
      the impossibility of rapidly restoring large-scale industry,
      means making preparations to help small-peasant farming, at all
      costs, at any price, pull out of its critical position to a
      bearable one, and for this purpose to revive small, local
      industry, and adopt measures which, by at once placing small
      production on a sound basis, would open up opportunities for
      local trade, thereby enlarging the sphere for the investment of
      capital, and also switching to new lines the whole Soviet
      power-its very foundations, and its entire economic policy.

      You are well aware of the effort it has cost us all, and you
      particularly, during the past three years to build up something
      like a stable food supply apparatus and to run it so that it
      might fulfil at least the most urgent and essential
      tasks. Hence, there is no need to tell you, who have been in the
      thick of all this, what it means quickly to reorganise all our
      work and switch it over to new lines; what it means to organise
      amidst so many unknowns, and, at the same time, to solve the
      problem of obtaining a larger quantity of food. You know all
      about it. Year after year, in spite of the terrible,
      unprecedented, sometimes super-human difficulties created by the
      Civil War, our food policy has
      produced striking and tangible results, and the improvement has
      been far more rapid than in any other sphere of Soviet work. But
      you also know, of course, that although, as a result of the
      strenuous efforts of the food supply workers, we have succeeded
      in raising grain collections from 110 million peods in the first
      year to over 280 million poods, you know very well that
      this is net enough.

      We are now, for the first time, entering on a big food supply
      campaign without any whiteguard troops or foreign armies on the
      territory of the R.S.F.S.R. But to this must be added some
      reservations: except for the intervention started by the
      Japanese in the Far Eastern Republic. Which shows again that in
      the very first year when we can say that, on the whole, we have
      done with the Civil War, it becomes evident that we are
      surrounded by the international bourgeoisie, whom the Red Army
      taught a harsh lesson, but who has not by any means abandoned
      the idea of resuming the attack, in open or undercover,
      systematic or sporadic form, at the very first opportunity. So
      even here we have no sure guarantee. But in addition to all this
      you know that the very transition from war to economic
      development, the transition about which we talked so long, and
      to which we devoted several Party conferences and congresses,
      this transition in itself, is a transition, created fresh
      difficulties of vast proportions because, with a dislocated
      state apparatus and transport a shambles, enormous difficulties
      arose from the very transition from the old, large army, ranged
      on the frontier in battle formation, to a peacetime army. The
      signs are that we have overcome most of these difficulties;
      nevertheless, as anyone familiar with the situation will agree,
      quite a number of difficulties still confront us.

      That is why I say that this food conference is exceptionally
      important, that it must settle other questions besides those
      specifically connected with the food supply, that your attention
      and efforts on behalf of the Republic are required not only in
      your capacity of food supply workers, and men on whom the Soviet
      government has placed the crucial task of supplying the
      population with food. T say that this is not enough. You as
      Party workers must exert all your efforts to fulfil a number of
      tasks which so far exist only in the form of instructions and
      decisions adopted by the supreme organs of the Soviet power and
      by the Party. And you know perfectly well what a wide gap there
      is between general decisions, general instructions, and their
      practical application. You are aware that this entails enormous
      effort, which must be exerted in order to put these principles
      successfully into practice, to prevent then from remaining a
      dead letter, as, unfortunately, often happens in Soviet
      Russia.

      I should like to remind you of the decision adopted by the last
      Party Conference which dealt specifically with the question of
      the New Economic Policy.[2] The Party
      conference was called urgently for the purpose of convincing all
      comrades that this policy had been adopted, as was said at the
      conference, in earnest and for a long time and to prevent any
      wavering on that score in future, for there has been some
      wavering and uncertainty. The Party conference, as the supreme
      organ of the ruling, government Party, the leading authority of
      the working class, emphasised the importance of collecting the
      large food stock of 400 million poods. It laid emphasis
      on the point that the whole meaning of our food policy,
      permitting a large measure of unrestricted trade, boils down to
      building up a big food fund, as a large state reserve. Without
      it, neither the restoration of large-scale industry nor the
      restoration of the currency will be possible, and every
      socialist understands that unless large-scale industry-the only
      real basis.-is restored, it is no use talking about socialist
      construction.

      No country has been so devastated as ours. It had been more
      backward than other countries before the imperialist war, which
      brought it more ruin than it did to any other country, and in
      addition we had to endure the untold hardships of another three
      years of war against the bourgeoisie and the landowners. The
      vanquished countries with which Russia might be compared,
      countries like Serbia and Austria—where industry has been
      ruined to an extent equal to, and in some cases even greater
      than, that of Russia—are in desperate straits. Counting on
      the assistance of the bourgeoisie—for they did not rise
      against it-they are crushed

      by a double burden: starvation, ruin and impoverishment (as in
      our case), plus the realisation that their position is hopeless,
      that they had put their stake on the bourgeoisie and are
      perishing without any prospects of assistance. But, in spite of
      all our incredible difficulties, we see and clearly realise, and
      the mass of workers and peasants clearly realise—in spite
      of our incredible difficulties fresh forces are arising. Every
      difficulty brought to life fresh forces, created new sources of
      energy and indicated new paths. The work these forces have
      performed proves to us that, terribly slow though it is, we are
      making progress, that frightfully hard though it may be to
      overcome difficulties at times, we are nevertheless overcoming
      them. There is a growing realisation that economic relationships
      are being built upon entirely new lines, that great as its
      sufferings may be, the working class is, step by step, day after
      day, finding solutions for all problems without the aid of the
      capitalists, and is fighting them, and dislodging them from one
      position after another.

      This, comrades, seems to me to be the sum and substance of the
      decisions adopted by the Party conference. And with this I want
      particularly to emphasise that the present conference is not
      only a conference of specialists, but of Party and Soviet
      workers upon whom will devolve the practical task of building,
      under extremely difficult conditions, the new forms of economic
      policy and the foundation of the whole Soviet edifice.

      We shall have to build in two ways: by collecting the tax and by
      reviving commodity exchange. The tax has been fixed, on the
      assumption of an average harvest, at 240 million poods,
      which is inadequate even for a short ration for the army which
      we need, and for the absolutely essential industrial
      enterprises. It will be difficult to collect this amount in
      full, not only in view of the threatening crop failure, but
      under any circumstances.

      I have not got the exact figures before me showing the changes
      in the percentages of fulfilment of our food supply plans and
      assignments according to districts during the three years that
      we have been carrying on food supply operations. But everyone
      knows that the machinery we have created by our joint efforts is
      running far more smoothly than that of a number of other
      People’s Commissariats, and that our efficiency is
      steadily increasing. I also take it as an irrefutable fact that
      this year, when so much attention is being devoted to this work,
      we shall cope more fully with the tasks the Republic has set
      us. We must achieve, if not 100 per cent, then as near to that
      figure as possible; and we can achieve it, even amidst the
      difficulties created by the threatening failure of the
      harvest. The tax deficit may run to tens of millions of
      poods, but this may be balanced by the extra amount
      that is likely to be collected in areas where the harvest has
      been particularly good.

      Comrades, the harvest absolutely refuses to reckon with the
      state of the food supply apparatus, and it has not given us the
      satisfaction of being particularly good where the food supply
      apparatus is particularly good. If we look at the chart
      indicating the harvest prospects we shall find that the areas of
      the R.S.F.S.H. and of neighbouring and fraternal republics where
      the harvest outlook is particularly good, or is above the
      average, are the very regions where the food supply apparatus is
      certainly not above the average, but even below it. Vigorous
      measures must be taken to transfer extra food supply workers to
      these areas, but we know too few people who are sufficiently
      trained and experienced to adapt themselves to the new areas
      quickly and get things moving at once. This is a matter that
      requires very close attention.

      The main thing is commodity exchange, and it is this the Party
      conference put into the forefront and the last Party Congress
      decided. It is the question that is engaging most of the concern
      and attention of all those who are at the head of Soviet and
      Party work in Moscow. How well are we prepared for it? What has
      been actually done? What part of these plans has been carried
      out? You will be the first to have to answer these questions
      from first-hand experience. Your experience in this matter and
      its summing up will be of particular and vital importance.

      This is a new field, and additional forces must be sent in. It
      demands that the food supply apparatus should be something more
      than it has been up to now-nothing but a more or less uniform
      and smoothly running machine for collecting a quantity of food
      products. No, here you will have to take account of the
      difference in the localities, in the goods demanded and the
      equivalents offered. You will not have to adjust yourselves to
      what the Soviet government wants, and to what the Soviet
      apparatus can carry out. No, you will have to adjust yourselves
      to the economic conditions of the small farmers, and will have
      to reckon with their satisfied and outstanding needs. You have
      fought the profiteers and have combated trade conducted in
      contravention of government orders. You will have to go on
      fighting them. But in order to engage in the exchange of
      commodities and avoid being beaten in the free market which
      means being beaten by unrestricted trade-you must know it
      thoroughly, compete with it, fight it with its own weapons and
      beat it at its own game, but to be able to do that you must have
      a thorough knowledge of it.

      The old bureaucratic methods are of no use; we need precise
      knowledge of commercial conditions and the ability to react
      quickly to every change. For this purpose, food products and
      articles for exchange must he rapidly transported from place to
      place over the vast territory of the II.S.F.S.H. The
      difficulties ahead of us are enormous. But this will be the
      basis of the whole of our New Economic Policy for the period
      until we fully restore large-scale industry. This may take at
      least ten years, during which time we must create such relations
      between the working class and the peasantry-the only classes
      that can serve as a base on which to build up our economy-and
      such an alliance between them as will economically satisfy both
      sides. It must be an alliance in which the small peasant will he
      reckoned with as a small peasant, until we are able to provide
      him with all the products of large-scale industry.

      We must reckon with the small proprietor who sells his surplus
      products. We must also reckon with the need to improve the
      condition of the urban population-the workers. Unless we do
      this, we shall fail in our further work of construction that
      will so consolidate the transition to socialism that there will
      be no turning hack. That is why commodity exchange is now the
      most important part of our economic policy. This is the task
      you, food supply workers, business managers and co-operators,
      will have to tackle.

      This is what the Soviet government, the Party, and the whole
      Republic expect of you, for your attitude to this work and your
      successes will determine the success of what the Soviet Republic
      is now staking everything on in the work of socialist
      construction.

      Comrades, I must say ill conclusion that your conference has a
      special task before it: to consider a matter that was raised in
      the Political Bureau of the Party’s Central Committee in
      May, and settled, after discussion on the Central Committee, at
      the All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions. It is to set to work,
      with due circumspection and very gradually, but immediately, to
      try out the system of collective supplies. The present system of
      food distribution has proved to be defective, and this cannot go
      on. The system of distributing food on the egalitarian principle
      has led to equalisation, which sometimes proves to be an
      obstacle to increasing output. The Republic must utilise the
      food surpluses it collects to maintain only what is needed for
      industry. We cannot maintain all our factories, nor is it
      necessary to do so: that would be wasteful management. We cannot
      restore the whole of large-scale industry, and so we must select
      and maintain only those factories which have the best equipment
      and promise a greater output.

      Food supply workers cannot just go on thinking that their
      business boils down to collecting so many millions of
      poods and distributing them in certain fixed rations,
      on the present ration cards, say, and that there is the end of
      it. The immediate thing is to integrate the activity of all the
      economic People’s Commissariats. The conscientious food
      supply worker must not only be interested in food supply work,
      but in all economic activity. More is expected of him now.

      He cannot go on being only a food supply worker, lie must be an
      economist appraising every step in the light of the work of all
      the economic People’s Commissariats, and of all the
      results achieved by that work.

      It is wrong to think that food distribution is only a matter of
      fairness. We must bear ill mind that it is a method, an
      instrument, and a means of increasing output. State food
      supplies must be given only to those employees who are really
      needed, on the condition that productivity of labour

      is increased to the utmost. And if the distribution of food is
      to he used as a political instrument, then it must be used to
      reduce the number of those who are not absolutely needed and to
      encourage those who actually are. If the distribution of food is
      a political instrument for restoring our industry, then we must
      maintain the industrial enterprises which are really needed now,
      and certainly stop maintaining those we do not need now, and
      thus economise fuel and food. For a number of years we have been
      managing these things very badly. This must now be
      rectified.

      Thus, you see that the closer you look into the matter the wider
      you find the tasks confronting your food conference. I hope,
      however, that none of you will be intimidated by the complexity
      of these tasks, and that, on the contrary, the unusual nature of
      your tasks as Soviet and Party workers will stimulate you to
      fresh efforts to fulfil them. Our past experience of the work of
      other People’s Commissariats clearly proves the necessity
      of combining Soviet and Party work. Food supply workers have
      carried out a number of urgent tasks under extremely difficult
      conditions; and they did it successfully because in these cases
      the Soviet and Party bodies resorted to unconventional methods,
      urgent measures and shock-work campaign operations. I repeat
      that it is the fundamental basis of our economic policy that is
      the main subject of your food conference. It must engage all
      your attention.

      In conclusion, permit me to express the conviction that our
      united efforts in the direction we have taken will lay a firm
      foundation for a successful economic policy that will create an
      alliance between the working class and the peasantry, the two
      main classes on which the Soviet power rests, the economic
      alliance which alone can guarantee the success of all our work
      of socialist construction. (Stormy applause.)

1 Theses For A Report On The Tactics Of The R.C.P.
 1. The International Position Of The R.S.F.S.R.
    

      The international position of the R.S.F.S.R. at present is
      distinguished by a certain equilibrium, which, although
      extremely unstable, has nevertheless given rise to a peculiar
      state of affairs in world politics.

      This peculiarity is the following. On the one hand, the
      international bourgeoisie is filled with furious hatred of, and
      hostility towards, Soviet Russia, and is prepared at any moment
      to fling itself upon her in order to strangle her. On the other
      hand, all attempts at military intervention, which have cost the
      international bourgeoisie hundreds of millions of francs, ended
      in complete failure, in spite of the fact that the Soviet power
      was then weaker than it is now and that the Russian landowners
      and capitalists had whole armies on the territory of the
      R.S.F.S.R. Opposition to the war against Soviet Russia has grown
      considerably in all capitalist countries, adding fuel to the
      revolutionary movement of the proletariat and extending to very
      wide sections of the petty-bourgeois democrats. The conflict of
      interests between the various imperialist countries has become
      acute, and is growing more acute every day. The revolutionary
      movement among the hundreds of millions of oppressed peoples of
      the East is growing with remarkable vigour. The result of all
      these conditions is that international imperialism has proved
      unable to strangle Soviet Russia, although it is far stronger,
      and has been obliged for the time being to grant her
      recognition, or semi-recognition, and to conclude trade
      agreements with her.

      The result is a state of equilibrium which, although highly
      unstable and precarious, enables the Socialist Republic to
      exist—not for long, of course—within the capitalist
      encirclement.

  2. The International Alignment Of Class Forces
    

      This state of affairs has given rise to the following
      international alignment of class forces.

      The international bourgeoisie, deprived of the opportunity of
      waging open war against Soviet Russia, is waiting and watching
      for the moment when circumstances will permit it to resume the
      war.

      The proletariat in all the advanced capitalist countries has
      already formed its vanguard, the Communist Parties, which are
      growing, making steady progress towards winning the majority of
      the proletariat in each country, and destroying the influence of
      the old trade union bureaucrats and of the upper stratum of the
      working class of America and Europe, which has been corrupted by
      imperialist privileges.

      The petty-bourgeois democrats in the capitalist countries, whose
      foremost sections are represented by the Second and
      Two-and-a-Half Internationals, serve today as the mainstay of
      capitalism, since they retain an influence over the majority, or
      a considerable section, of the industrial and commercial workers
      and office employees who are afraid that if revolution breaks
      out they will lose the relative petty-bourgeois prosperity
      created by the privileges of imperialism. But the growing
      economic crisis is worsening the condition of broad sections of
      the people everywhere, and this, with the looming inevitability
      of new imperialist wars if capitalism is preserved, is steadily
      weakening this mainstay.

      The masses of the working people in the colonial and semi
      colonial countries, who constitute the overwhelming majority of
      the population of the globe, were roused to political life at
      the turn of the twentieth century, particularly by the
      revolutions in Russia, Turkey, Persia and China. The imperialist
      war of 1914-18 and the Soviet power in Russia are completing the
      process of converting these masses into an active factor in
      world politics and in the revolutionary destruction of
      imperialism, although the educated philistines of Europe and
      America, including the leaders of the Second and Two-and-a-Half
      Internationals, stubbornly refuse to see this. British India is
      at the head of these countries, and there revolution is maturing
      in proportion, on the one hand, to the growth of the industrial
      and railway proletariat, and, on the other, to the increase in
      the brutal terrorism of the British,  who with ever greater
      frequency resort to massacres (Amritsar),[2] public
      floggings, etc.

      3. The Alignment Of Class Forces In Russia

      The internal political situation in Soviet Russia is determined
      by the fact that here, for the first time in history, there have
      been, for a number of years, only two classes—the
      proletariat, trained for decades by a very young, but modern,
      large-scale machine industry, and the small peasantry, who
      constitute the overwhelming majority of the population.

      In Russia, the big landowners and capitalists have not vanished,
      but they have been subjected to total expropriation and crushed
      politically as a class, whose remnants are hiding out among
      Soviet government employees. They have preserved their class
      organisation abroad, as émigrés, numbering probably
      from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 people, with over 50 daily
      newspapers of all bourgeois and “socialist” (i.e.,
      petty-bourgeois) parties, the remnants of an army, and numerous
      connections with the international bourgeoisie. These
      émigrés are striving, with might and main, to destroy
      the Soviet power and restore capitalism in Russia.

      4. The Proletariat And The Peasantry In Russia

      This being the internal situation in Russia, the main task now
      confronting her proletariat, as the ruling class, is properly to
      determine and carry out the measures that are necessary to lead
      the peasantry, establish a firm alliance with them and achieve
      the transition, in a series of gradual stages, to large-scale,
      socialised, mechanised agriculture. This is a particularly
      difficult task in Russia, both because of her backwardness, and
      her extreme state of ruin as a 

      result of seven years of imperialist and civil war. But apart
      from these specific circumstances, this is one of the most
      difficult tasks of socialist construction that will confront all
      capitalist countries, with, perhaps, the sole exception of
      Britain. However, even in regard to Britain it must not be
      forgotten that, while the small tenant farmers there constitute
      only a very small class, the percentage of workers and office
      employees who enjoy a petty-bourgeois standard of living is
      exceptionally high, due to the actual enslavement of hundreds of
      millions of people in Britain’s colonial possessions.

      Hence, from the standpoint of development of the world
      proletarian revolution as a single process, the epoch Russia is
      passing through is significant as a practical test and a
      verification of the policy of a proletariat in power towards the
      mass of the petty bourgeoisie.

      5. The Military Alliance Between The Proletariat
  And The Peasantry In The R.S.F.S.R.

      The basis for proper relations between the proletariat and the
      peasantry in Soviet Russia was created in the period of 1917-21
      when the invasion of the capitalists and landowners, supported
      by the whole world bourgeoisie and all the petty-bourgeois
      democratic parties (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks),
      caused the proletariat and the peasantry to form, sign and seal
      a military alliance to defend the Soviet power. Civil war is the
      most intense form of class struggle, but the more intense it is,
      the more rapidly its flames consume all petty-bourgeois
      illusions and prejudices, and the more clearly experience proves
      even to the most backward strata of the peasantry that only the
      dictatorship of the proletariat can save it, and that the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are in fact merely the
      servants of the landowners and capitalists.

      But while the military alliance between the proletariat and the
      peasantry was—and had perforce to be—the primary
      form of their firm alliance, it could not have been maintained
      even for a few weeks without an economic alliance between the
      two classes. The peasants received from the workers’ state
      all the land and were given protection against the landowners
      and the kulaks; the workers have been receiving from the
      peasants loans of food supplies until large-scale industry is
      restored.

      6. The Transition To Proper Economic Relations
 Between The Proletariat And The Peasantry

      The alliance between the small peasants and the proletariat can
      become a correct and stable one from the socialist standpoint
      only when the complete restoration of transport and large-scale
      industry enables the proletariat to give the peasants, in
      exchange for food, all the goods they need for their own use and
      for the improvement of their farms. With the country in ruins,
      this could not possibly be achieved at once. The surplus
      appropriation system was the best measure available to the
      insufficiently organised state to maintain itself in the
      incredibly arduous war against the landowners. The crop failure
      and the fodder shortage in 1920 particularly increased the
      hardships of the peasantry, already severe enough, and made the
      immediate transition to the tax in kind imperative.

      The moderate tax in kind will bring about a big improvement in
      the condition of the peasantry at once, and will at the same
      time stimulate them to enlarge crop areas and improve farming
      methods.

      The tax in kind signifies a transition from the requisition of
      all the peasants’ surplus grain to regular socialist
      exchange of products between industry and agriculture.

      7. The Conditions Under Which The Soviet Government Can
         Permit Capitalism And Concessions, And The Significance
         Thereof

      Naturally, the tax in kind means freedom for the peasant to
      dispose of his after-tax surplus at his own discretion. Since
      the state cannot provide the peasant with goods from socialist
      factories in exchange for all his surplus, freedom to trade with
      this surplus necessarily means freedom for the development of
      capitalism.

      Within the limits indicated, however, this is not at all
      dangerous for socialism as long as transport and large-scale
      industry remain in the hands of the proletariat. On the
      contrary, the development of capitalism, controlled and
      regulated by the proletarian state (i.e., “state”
      capitalism in this sense of the term), is advantageous
      and necessary in an extremely devastated and backward
      small-peasant country (within certain limits, of course),
      inasmuch as it is capable of hastening the immediate
      revival of peasant farming. This applies still more to
      concessions: without denationalising anything, the
      workers’ state leases certain mines, forest tracts,
      oilfields, and so forth, to foreign capitalists in order to
      obtain from them extra equipment and machinery that will enable
      us to accelerate the restoration of Soviet large-scale
      industry.

      The payment made to the concessionaires in the form of a share
      of the highly valuable products obtained is undoubtedly tribute,
      which the workers’ state pays to the world bourgeoisie;
      without in any way glossing this over, we must clearly realise
      that we stand to gain by paying this tribute, so long as it
      accelerates the restoration of our large-scale industry and
      substantially improves the condition of the workers and
      peasants.

      8. The Success Of Our Food Policy

      The food policy pursued by Soviet Russia in 1917-21 was
      undoubtedly very crude and imperfect, and gave rise to many
      abuses. A number of mistakes were made in its
      implementation. But as a whole, it was the only possible policy
      under the conditions prevailing at the time. And it did fulfil
      its historic mission: it saved the proletarian dictatorship in a
      ruined and backward country. There can be no doubt that it has
      gradually improved. In the first year that we had full power
      (August 1, 1918 to August 1, 1919) the state collected 110
      million poods of grain; in the second year it collected
      220 million poods, and in the third year—over 285
      million poods.

      Now, having acquired practical experience, we have set out, and
      expect, to collect 400 million poods (the tax in kind
      is expected to bring in 240 million poods). Only when
      it is actually in possession of an adequate stock of food will
      the workers’ state be able to stand firmly on its own feet
      economically, secure the, steady, if slow, restoration of
      large-scale industry, and create a proper financial system.

      
 9. The Material Basis Of Socialism And The Plan
 For The Electrification Of Russia

      A large-scale machine industry capable of reorganising
      agriculture is the only material basis that is possible for
      socialism. But we cannot confine ourselves to this general
      thesis. It must be made more concrete. Large-scale industry
      based on the latest achievements of technology and capable of
      reorganising agriculture implies the electrification of the
      whole country. We had to undertake the scientific work of
      drawing up such a plan for the electrification of the
      R.S.F.S.R. and we have accomplished it. With the co-operation of
      over two hundred of the best scientists, engineers and
      agronomists in Russia, this work has now been completed; it was
      published in a large volume and, as a whole, endorsed by the
      Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December
      1920. Arrangements have now been made to convene an all-Russia
      congress of electrical engineers in August 1921 to examine this
      plan in detail, before it is given final government
      endorsement. The execution of the first part of the
      electrification scheme is estimated to take ten years, and will
      require about 370 million man-days.

      In 1918, we had eight newly erected power stations (with a total
      capacity of 4,757 kw); in 1919, the figure rose to 36 (total
      capacity of 1,648 kw), and in 1920, it rose to 100 (total
      capacity of 8,699 kw).

      Modest as this beginning is for our vast country, a start has
      been made, work has begun and is making steady progress. After
      the imperialist war, after a million prisoners of war in Germany
      had become familiar with modern up-to-date technique, after the
      stern but hardening experience of three years of civil war, the
      Russian peasant is a different man. With every passing month he
      sees more clearly and more vividly that only the guidance given
      by the proletariat is capable of leading the mass of small
      farmers out of capitalist slavery to socialism.

      10. The Role Of “Pure Democracy”, The Second 
      And Two-And-A-Half Internationals, 
      The Socialist-Revolutionaries And The Mensheviks As The
      Allies Of Capital


      The dictatorship of the proletariat does not signify a
      cessation of the class struggle, but its continuation in a
      new form and with new weapons. This dictatorship is
      essential as long as classes exist, as long as the
      bourgeoisie, overthrown in one country, intensifies tenfold
      its attacks on socialism on an international scale. In the
      transition period, the small farmer class is bound to
      experience certain vacillations. The difficulties of
  transition, and the influence of the bourgeoisie, inevitably
      cause the mood of this mass to change from time to
      time. Upon the proletariat, enfeebled and to a certain
      extent declassed by the destruction of the large-scale
      machine industry, which is its vital foundation, devolves
      the very difficult but paramount historic task of holding
      out in spite of these vacillations, and of carrying to
      victory its cause of emancipating labour from the yoke of
      capital.

      The policy pursued-by the petty-bourgeois democratic
      parties, i.e., the parties affiliated to the Second and
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals, represented in Russia by the
  S.R. (Socialist-Revolutionary) and Menshevik parties, is the
  political expression of the vacillations of the petty
  bourgeoisie. These parties now have their headquarters and
  newspapers abroad, and are actually in a bloc with the whole
  of the bourgeois counter-revolution and are serving it
  loyally.

  The shrewd leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie headed by
  Milyukov, the leader of the Cadet (Constitutional
  Democratic) Party, have quite clearly, definitely and openly
  appraised this role of the petty-bourgeois democrats, i.e.,
  the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. In connection
  with the Kronstadt mutiny, in which the Mensheviks,
  Socialist-Revolutionaries and whiteguards, joined forces,
  Milyukov declared in favour of the “Soviets without
  the Bolsheviks” slogan. Elaborating on the idea, he
  wrote that the Socialist-Revolutionaries  and Mensheviks
  “are welcome to try” (Pravda No. 64,
  1921, quoted from the Paris Posledniye Novosti [3]), because upon them devolves the
  task of first taking power away from the
  Bolsheviks. Milyukov, the leader of the big bourgeoisie, has
  correctly appraised the lesson taught by all revolutions,
  namely, that the petty-bourgeois democrats are incapable of
  holding power, and always serve merely as a screen for the
  dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and a stepping stone to its
  undivided power.

  The proletarian revolution in Russia again and again
  confirms this lesson of 1789-94 and 1848-49, and also what
  Frederick Engels said in his letter to Bebel of December 11,
  1884.

  . . .“Pure democracy . . . when the moment of
  revolution comes, acquires a temporary importance . . . as
  the final sheet-anchor of the whole bourgeois and even
  feudal economy. . . . Thus between March and September 1848
  the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass strengthened the liberals
  in order to hold down the revolutionary masses. . . . In any
  case our sole adversary on the day of the crisis and on the
  day after the crisis will be the whole of the reaction which
  will group around pure democracy, and this,  I think, should
  not be lost sight of.” (Published in Russian in
  Kommunistichesky Trud[4] No. 360, June
  9, 1921, in an article by Comrade V. Adoratsky: “Marx
  and Engels on Democracy”. In German, published in the
  book, Friedrich Engels, Politisches
  Vermächtnis, Internationale Jugend-Bibliothek,
  Nr. 12, Berlin, 1920, S. 19.)

  2. 
  Speech On The Italian Question
 June 28

  Comrades, I should like to reply mainly to Comrade
  Lazzari. He said: “Quote concrete facts, not
  words.” Excellent. But if we trace the development of
  the reformist opportunist trend in Italy, what will that be,
  words or facts? In your speeches and in the whole of your
  policy you lose sight of the fact, which is so important for
  the socialist movement in Italy, that not only this trend,
  but an opportunist reformist group has existed for quite a
  long time. I still very well remember the time when
  Bernstein started his opportunist propaganda, which ended in
  social-patriotism, in the treason and bankruptcy of the
  Second International. We have known Turati ever since, not
  only by name, but for his propaganda in the Italian party
  and in the Italian working-class movement, of which he has
  been a disrupter for the past twenty years. Lack of time
  prevents me from closely studying the material concerning
  the Italian party; but I think that one of the most
  important documents on this subject is a report, published
  in a bourgeois Italian newspaper—I don’t
  remember which,  La Stampa[5] or Corriere
  della Sera[6]—of the conference held by
  Turati and his friends in Reggio Emilia.[7] I compared that report with the
  one published in Avanti![8] Is this not
  proof enough? After the Second Congress of the Communist
  International, we, in our controversy with Serrati and his
  friends, openly and definitely told them what, in our
  opinion, the situation was. We told them that the Italian
  party could not become a Communist Party as long as it
  tolerated people like Turati in its ranks.

  What is this, political facts, or again just words? After
  the Second Congress of the Communist International we openly
  said to the Italian proletariat: “Don’t unite
  with the reformists, with Turati.” Serrati launched a
  series of articles in the Italian press in opposition to the
  Communist  International and convened a special conference
  of reformists.[9] Was all this mere words? It was
  something more than a split: it was the creation of a new
  party. One must have been blind not to have seen this. This
  document is of decisive importance for this question. All
  those who attended the Reggio Emilia conference must be
  expelled from the party; they are Mensheviks—not
  Russian, but Italian Mensheviks. Lazzari said: “We
  know the Italian people’s mentality.” For my
  part I would not dare to make such an assertion about the
  Russian people, but that is not important. “Italian
  Socialists understand the spirit of the Italian people very
  well,” said Lazzari. Perhaps they do, I will not argue
  about that. But they do not know Italian Menshevism, if the
  concrete facts and the persistent refusal to eradicate
  Menshevism is anything to go by. We are obliged to say
  that—deplorable though it may be—the resolution
  of our Executive Committee must be confirmed. A party which
  tolerates opportunists and reformists like Turati in its
  ranks cannot be affiliated to the Communist
  International.

  “Why should we change the name of the party?”
  asks Comrade Lazzari. “The present one is quite
  satisfactory.” But we cannot share this view. We know
  the history of the Second International, its fall and
  bankruptcy. Do we not know the history of the German party?
  And do we not know that the great misfortune of the
  working-class movement in Germany is that the break was not
  brought about before the war? This cost the lives of twenty
  thousand workers, whom the Scheidemannists and the Centrists
  betrayed to the German Government by their polemics with and
  complaints against the German Communists.[10]

  And do we not now see the same thing in Italy? The Italian
  party was never a truly revolutionary party. Its great
  misfortune is that it did not break with the Mensheviks and
  reformists before the war, and that the latter continued to
  remain in the party. Comrade Lazzari says: “We fully
  recognise the necessity of a break with the reformists; our
  only disagreement is that we did not think it necessary to
  bring it about at the Leghorn Congress.” But the facts
  tell a different story. This is not the first time that we
  are discussing Italian reformism. In arguing about this with
  Serrati last year, we said: “You won’t mind us
  asking why the split in the Italian party cannot be brought
  about immediately, why it must be postponed?” What did
  Serrati say in reply to that? Nothing. And Comrade Lazzari,
  quoting an article by Frossard in which the latter said,
  “We must be adroit and clever”, evidently thinks
  that this is an argument in his favour and against us. I
  think he is mistaken. On the contrary, it is an excellent
  argument in our favour and against Comrade Lazzari. What
  will the Italian workers say when you are obliged to explain
  your conduct and your resignation? What will you tell them
  if they declare our tactics to be clever and adroit compared
  with the zigzags of the pseudo-Communist Left—the Left
  which at times is not even simply Communist and more often
  looks like anarchism?

  What is the meaning of the tales told by Serrati and his
  party about the Russians only wanting everyone to imitate
  them? We want the very opposite. It takes more than
  memorising communist resolutions and using revolutionary
  phrases on every possible occasion. That is not enough, and
  we are opposed beforehand to Communists who know this or
  that resolution by heart. The mark of true communism is a
  break with opportunism. We shall be quite frank and open
  with those Communists who subscribe to this and, boldly, in
  the conviction that we are right, will tell them:
  “Don’t do anything stupid; be clever and
  skilful.” But we shali speak in this way only with
  Communists who have broken with the opportunists, something
  that cannot yet be said about you. I repeat therefore: I
  hope the Congress will confirm the resolution of the
  Executive Committee. Comrade Lazzari said: “We are in
  the preparatory period.” This is absolutely true. You
  are in the preparatory period. The first stage of this
  period is a break with the Mensheviks, similar to the one we
  brought about with our Mensheviks in 1903. The sufferings
  the whole of the German working class has had to endure
  during this long and weary post-war period in the history of
  the German revolution are due to the fact that the German
  party did not break with the Mensheviks.

  Comrade Lazzari said that the Italian party is passing
  through the preparatory period. This I fully accept. And the
  first stage is a definite, final, unambiguous and determined
  break with reformism. When that is brought about the masses
  will side solidly with communism. The second stage is by no
  means a repetition of revolutionary slogans. It will be the
  adoption of our wise and skilful decisions, which will
  always be such, and which will always say: fundamental
  revolutionary principles must be adapted to the specific
  conditions in the various countries.

  The revolution in Italy will run a different course from
  that in Russia. It will start in a different way. How?
  Neither you nor we know. The Italian Communists are not
  always Communists to a sufficient degree. Did a single
  Communist  show his mettle when the workers seized the
  factories in Italy?[11]] No. At that
  time, there was as yet no communism in Italy; there was a
  certain amount of anarchism, but no Marxian communism. The
  latter has still to be created and the masses of the workers
  must be imbued with it by means of the experience of the
  revolutionary struggle. And the first step along this road
  is a final break with the Mensheviks, who for more than
  twenty years have been collaborating and working with the
  bourgeois government. It is quite Probable that Modigliani,
  whom I was able to watch to some extent at the Zimmerwald
  and Kienthal conferences, is a sufficiently astute
  politician to keep out of the bourgeois government and to
  keep in the centre of the Socialist Party, where he can be
  far more useful to the bourgeoisie. But all the theories of
  Turati and his friends, all their propaganda and agitation,
  signify collaboration with the bourgeoisie. Is this not
  proved by the numerous quotations in Gennari’s speech?
  Indeed, it is the united front which Turati has already
  prepared. That is why I must say to Comrade Lazzari:
  “Speeches like yours and like the one which Comrade
  Serrati made here do not help to prepare for the revolution,
  they disorganise it. “ (Shouts :
  “Bravo!” Applause.)

  You had a considerable majority at Leghorn. You had 98,000
  votes against 14,000 reformist and 58,000 communist
  votes. As the beginning of a purely communist movement in a
  country like Italy, with its well-known traditions, where
  the ground has not been sufficiently prepared for a split,
  this vote is a considerable achievement for the
  Communists.

  This is a great victory and tangible proof of the fact that
  the working-class movement in Italy will develop faster than
  our movement developed in Russia, because, if you are
  familiar with the figures concerning our movement, you must
  know that in February 1917, after the fall of tsarism and
  during the bourgeois republic, we were still a minority
  compared with the Mensheviks. Such was the position after
  fifteen years of fierce fighting and splits. Our Right wing
  did not grow—and it was not so easy to prevent it from
  growing, as you seem to think when you speak of Russia in
  such a disparaging tone. Undoubtedly, development in Italy
  will proceed quite differently. After fifteen years of
  struggle against the Mensheviks, and after the fall of
  tsarism, we started work with a much smaller number of
  adherents. You have 58,000 communistically minded workers
  against 98,000 united Centrists who occupy an indefinite
  position. This is proof, this is a fact, which should
  certainly convince all those who refuse to close their eyes
  to the mass movement of the Italian workers. Nothing comes
  all at once. But it certainly proves that the mass of
  workers—not the old leaders, the bureaucrats, the
  professors, the journalists, but the class that is actually
  exploited, the vanguard of the exploited—supports
  us. And it proves what a great mistake you made at
  Leghorn. This is a fact. You controlled 98,000 votes, but
  you preferred to go with 14,000 reformists against 58,000
  Communists. You should have gone with them even if they were
  not genuine Communists, even if they were only adherents of
  Bordiga—which is not true, for after the Second
  Congress Bordiga quite honestly declared that he had
  abandoned all anarchism and anti-parliamentarism. But what
  did you do? You chose to unite with 14,000 reformists and to
  break with 58,000 Communists. And this is the best proof
  that Serrati’s policy has been disastrous for
  Italy. We never wanted Serrati in Italy to copy the Russian
  revolution. That would have been stupid. We are intelligent
  and flexible enough to avoid such stupidity. But Serrati has
  proved that his policy in Italy was wrong. Perhaps he should
  have manoeuvred. This is the expression that he repeated
  most often when he was here last year. He said: “We
  know how to manoeuvre, we do not want slavish
  imitation. That would be idiocy. We must manoeuvre, so as to
  bring about a separation from opportunism. You Russians do
  not know how to do that. We Italians are more skilful at
  that sort of thing. That remains to be seen.” And what
  is it we saw? Serrati executed a brilliant manoeuvre. He
  broke away from 58,000 Communists. And now these comrades
  come here and say: “If you reject us the masses will
  be confused.” No, comrades, you are mistaken. The
  masses of the workers in Italy are confused now, and it will
  do them good if we tell them: “Comrades, you must
  choose; Italian workers, you must choose between the
  Communist International, which will never call upon you
  slavishly to imitate the Russians, and the Mensheviks, whom
  we have known for twenty years, and whom we shall never
  tolerate as neighbours in a genuinely revolutionary
  Communist International.” That is what we shall say to
  the Italian workers. There can be no doubt about the
  result. The masses of workers will follow us. (Loud
  approval.)

  Speech In Defence Of The Tactics Of The Communist International
  July 1

  Comrades! I deeply regret that I must confine myself to
  self-defence. (Laughter.) I say deeply regret,
  because after acquainting myself with Comrade
  Terracini’s speech and the amendments introduced by
  three delegations, I should very much like to take the
  offensive, for, properly speaking, offensive operations are
  essential against the views  defended by Terracini and these
  three delegations.[12] If the Congress is not going to
  wage a vigorous offensive against such errors, against such
  “Leftist” stupidities, the whole movement is
  doomed. That is my deep conviction. But we are organised and
  disciplined Marxists. We cannot be satisfied with speeches
  against individual comrades. We Russians are already sick
  and tired of these Leftist phrases. We are men of
  organisation. In drawing up our plans, we must proceed in an
  organised way and try to find the correct line. It is, of
  course, no secret that our theses are a compromise. And why
  not? Among Communists, who have already convened their Third
  Congress and have worked out definite fundamental
  principles, compromises under certain conditions are
  necessary. Our theses, put forward by the Russian
  delegation, were studied and prepared in the most careful
  way and were the result of long arguments and meetings with
  various delegations. They aim at establishing the basic line
  of the Communist International and are especially necessary
  now after we have not only formally condemned the real
  Centrists but have expelled them from the Party. Such are
  the facts. I have to stand up for these theses. Now, when
  Terracini comes forward and says that we must continue the
  fight against the Centrists, and goes on to tell how it is
  intended to wage the fight, I say that if these amendments
  denote a definite trend, a relentless fight against this
  trend is essential, for otherwise there is no communism and
  no Communist International. I am surprised that the German
  Communist Workers’ Party has not put its signature to
  these amendments. (Laughter.) Indeed, just listen
  to what Terracini is defending and what his amendments
  say. They begin in this way: “On page 1, column 1,
  line 19, the word ‘majority’ should be
  deleted.” Majority! That is extremely dangerous!
  (Laughter.) Then further: instead of the words
  “’basic propositions’, insert
  ‘aims’”. Basic propositions and aims are
  two different things; even the anarchists will agree with us
  about aims, because they too stand for the abolition of
  exploitation and class distinctions.

  I have met and talked with few anarchists in my life, but
  all the same I have seen enough of them. I sometimes
  succeeded in reaching agreement with them about aims, but
  never as regards principles. Principles are not an aim, a
  programme, a tactic or a theory. Tactics and theory are not
  principles. How do we differ from the anarchists on
  principles? The principles of communism consist in the
  establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and in
  the use of state coercion in the transition period. Such are
  the principles of communism, but they are not its aim. And
  the comrades who have tabled this proposal have made a
  mistake.

  Secondly, it is stated there: “the word
  ‘majority’ should be deleted.” Read the
  whole passage:

  “The Third Congress of the Communist International is
  setting out to review questions of tactics under conditions
  when in a whole number of countries the objective situation
  has become aggravated in a revolutionary sense, and when a
  whole number of communist mass parties have been organised,
  which, incidentally, in their actual revolutionary struggle
  have nowhere taken into their hands the virtual leadership
  of the majority of the working class.”

  And so, they want the word “majority”
  deleted. If we cannot agree on such simple things, then I do
  not understand how we can work together and lead the
  proletariat to victory. Then it is not at all surprising
  that we cannot reach agreement on the question of principles
  either. Show me a party which has already won the majority
  of the working class. Terracini did not even think of
  adducing any example. Indeed, there is no such example.

  And so, the word “aims” is to be put instead of
  “principles”, and the word
  “majority” is to be deleted. No, thank you! We
  shall not do it. Even the German party—one of the
  best—does not have the majority of the working class
  behind it. That is a fact. We, who face a most severe
  struggle, are not afraid to utter this truth, but here you
  have three delegations who wish to begin with an untruth,
  for if the Congress deletes the word “majority”
  it will show that it wants an untruth. That is quite
  clear.

  Then comes the following amendment:  “On page 4,
  column 1, line 10, the words ‘Open Letter’,
  etc., should be deleted.’’[13] I
  have already heard one speech today in which I found the
  same idea. But there it was quite natural. It was the speech
  of Comrade Hempel, a member of the German Communist
  Workers’ Party. He said: “The ‘Open
  Letter’ was an act of opportunism.” To my deep
  regret and shame, I have already heard such views
  privately. But when, at the Congress, after such prolonged
  debate, the “Open Letter” is declared
  opportunist—that is a shame and a disgrace! And now
  Comrade Terracini comes forward on behalf of the three
  delegations and wants to delete the words “Open
  Letter”. What is the good then of the fight against
  the German Communist Workers’ Party? The “Open
  Letter” is a model political step. This is stated in
  our theses and we must certainly stand by it. It is a model
  because it is the first act of a practical method of winning
  over the majority of the working class. In Europe, where
  almost all the proletarians are organised, we must win the
  majority of the working class and anyone who fails to
  understand this is lost to the communist movement; he will
  never learn anything if he has failed to learn that much
  during the three years of the great revolution.

  Terracini says that we were victorious in Russia although
  the Party was very small. He is dissatisfied with what is
  said in the theses about Czechoslovakia. Here there are 27
  amendments, and if I had a mind to criticise them I should,
  like some orators, have to speak for not less than three
  hours. . . . We have heard here that in Czechoslovakia the
  Communist Party has 300,000-400,000 members, and that it is
  essential to win over the majority, to create an invincible
  force and continue enlisting fresh masses of
  workers. Terracini is already prepared to attack. He says:
  if there are already 400,000 workers in the party, why
  should we want more? Delete! (Laughter.) He is
  afraid of the word “masses” and wants to
  eradicate it. Comrade Terracini has understood very little
  of the Russian revolution. In Russia, we were a small party,
  but we had with us in addition the majority of the Soviets
  of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies throughout
  the country. (Cries : “Quite true!”) Do
  you have anything of the sort? We had with us almost half
  the army, which then numbered at least ten million men. Do
  you really have the majority of the army behind you? Show me
  such a country! If these views of Comrade Terracini are
  shared by three other delegations, then something is wrong
  in the International! Then we must say: “Stop! There
  must be a decisive fight! Otherwise the Communist
  International is lost.” (Animation.)

  On the basis of my experience I must say, although I am
  taking up a defensive position (laughter ),
  that-the aim and the principle of my speech consist in
  defence of the resolution and theses proposed by our
  delegation. It would, of course, be pedantic to say that not
  a letter in them must be altered. I have had to read many
  resolutions and I am well aware that very good amendments
  could he introduced in every line of them. But that would be
  pedantry. If, nevertheless, I declare now that in a
  political sense not a single letter can be altered, it is
  because the amendments, as I see them, are of a quite
  definite political nature and because they lead us along a
  path that is harmful and dangerous to the Communist
  International. Therefore, I and all of us and the Russian
  delegation must insist that not a single letter in the
  theses is altered. We have not only condemned our Right-wing
  elements—we have expelled them. But if, like
  Terracini, people turn the fight against the Rightists into
  a sport, then we must say: “Stop! Otherwise the danger
  will become too grave!”

  Terracini has defended the theory of an offensive
  struggle.[14] In this connection the
  notorious amendments propose a formula two or three pages
  long. There is no need for us to read them. We know what
  they say. Terracini has stated the issue quite clearly. He
  has defended the theory of an offensive, pointing out
  “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition
  from passivity to activity”. We in Russia have already
  had adequate political experience in the struggle against
  the Centrists. As long as fifteen years ago, we were waging
  a struggle against our opportunists and Centrists, and also
  against the Mensheviks, and we were victorious not only over
  the Mensheviks, but also over the semi-anarchists.

  If we had not done this, we would not have been able to
  retain power in our hands for three and a half years, or
  even for three and a half weeks, and we would not have been
  able to convene communist congresses here. “Dynamic
  tendencies”, “transition from passivity to
  activity”—these are all phrases the Left
  Socialist-Revolutionaries had used against us. Now they are
  in prison, defending there the “aims of
  communism” and thinking of the “transition from
  passivity to activity”. (Laughter.) The line
  of reasoning followed in the proposed amendments is an
  impossible one, because they contain no Marxism, no
  political experience, and no reasoning. Have we in our
  theses elaborated a general theory of the revolutionary
  offensive? Has Radek or anyone of us committed such a
  stupidity? We have spoken of the theory of an offensive in
  relation to a quite definite country and at a quite definite
  period.

  From our struggle against the Mensheviks we can quote
  instances showing that even before the first revolution
  there were some who doubted whether the revolutionary party
  aught to conduct an offensive. If such doubts assailed any
  Social-Democrat—as we all called ourselves at that
  time—we took up the struggle against him and said that
  he was an opportunist, that he did not understand anything
  of Marxism and the dialectics of the revolutionary party. Is
  it really possible for a party to dispute whether a
  revolutionary offensive is permissible in general? To find
  such examples in this country one would have to go back some
  fifteen years. If there are Centrists or disguised Centrists
  who dispute the theory of the offensive, they should be
  immediately expelled. That question cannot give rise to
  disputes. But the fact that-even now, after three years of
  the Communist International, we are arguing about
  “dynamic tendencies”, about the
  “transition from passivity to
  activity”—that is a shame and a disgrace.

  We do not have any dispute about this with Comrade Radek,
  who drafted these theses jointly with us. Perhaps it was not
  quite correct to begin talking in Germany about the
  theory of the revolutionary offensive when an actual
  offensive had not been prepared. Nevertheless the March
  action was a great step forward in spite of the mistakes of
  its leaders. But this does not matter. Hundreds of thousands
  of workers fought heroically. However courageously the
  German Communist Workers’ Party fought against the
  bourgeoisie, we must repeat what Comrade Radek said in a
  Russian article about Hölz. If anyone, even an
  anarchist, fights heroically against the bourgeoisie, that
  is, of course, a great thing; but it is a real step forward
  if hundreds of thousands fight against the vile provocation
  of the social-traitors and against the bourgeoisie.

  It is very important to be critical of one’s
  mistakes. We began with that. If anyone, after a struggle in
  which hundreds of thousands have taken part, comes out
  against this struggle and behaves like Levi, then he should
  be expelled. And that is what was done. But we must draw a
  lesson from this. Had we really prepared for an offensive?
  (Radek : “We had not even prepared for
  defence.”) Indeed only newspaper articles talked of an
  offensive. This theory as applied to the March action in
  Germany in 1921 was incorrect—we have to admit
  that—but, in general, the theory of the revolutionary
  offensive is not at all false.

  We were victorious in Russia, and with such ease, because we
  prepared for our revolution during the imperialist war. That
  was the first condition. Ten million workers and peasants in
  Russia were armed, and our slogan was: an immediate peace at
  all costs. We were victorious because the vast mass of the
  peasants were revolutionarily disposed against the big
  landowners. The Socialist-Revolutionaries, the adherents of
  the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals, were a big
  peasant party in November 1917. They demanded revolutionary
  methods but, like true heroes of the Second and the
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals, lacked the courage to act in
  a revolutionary way. In August  and September 1917 we said:
  “Theoretically we are fighting the
  Socialist-Revolutionaries as we did before, but practically
  we are ready to accept their programme because only we are
  able to put it into effect.” We did just what we
  said. The peasantry, ill-disposed towards us in November
  1917, after our victory, who sent a majority of
  Socialist-Revolutionaries into the Constituent Assembly,
  were won over by us, if not in the course of a few
  days—as I mistakenly expected and predicted—at
  any rate in the course of a few weeks. The difference was
  not great. Can you point out any country in Europe where you
  could win over the majority of the peasantry in the course
  of a few weeks? Italy perhaps? (Laughter.) If it is
  said that we were victorious in Russia in spite of not
  having a big party, that only proves that those who say it
  have not understood the Russian revolution and that they
  have absolutely no understanding of how to prepare for a
  revolution.

  Our first step was to create a real Communist Party so as to
  know whom we were talking to and whom we could fully
  trust. The slogan of the First and Second congresses was
  “Down with the Centrists!” We cannot hope to
  master even the ABC of communism, unless all along the line
  and throughout the world we make short shrift of the
  Centrists and semi-Centrists, whom in Russia we call
  Mensheviks. Our first task is to create a genuinely
  revolutionary party and to break with the Mensheviks. But
  that is only a preparatory school. We are already convening
  the Third Congress, and Comrade Terracini keeps saying that
  thc task of the preparatory school collsists in hunting out,
  pursuing and exposing Centrists and semi-Centrists. No,
  thank you! We have already done this long enough. At the
  Second Congress we said that the Centrists are our
  enemies. But, we must go forward really. The second stage,
  after organising into a party, consists in learning to
  prepare for revolution. In many countries we have not even
  learned how to assume the leadership. We were victorious in
  Russia not only because the undisputed majority of the
  working class was on our side (during the elections in 1917
  the overwhelming majority of the workers were with us
  against the Mensheviks), but also because half the army,
  immediately after our seizure of power, and nine-tenths of
  the peasants,  in the course of some weeks, came over to our
  side; we were victorious because we adopted the agrarian
  programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries instead of our
  own, and put it into effect. Our victory lay in the fact
  that we carried out the Socialist-Revolutionary programme;
  that is why this victory was so easy. Is it possible that
  you in the West can have such illusions? It is ridiculous!
  Just compare the concrete economic conditions, Comrade
  Terracini and all of you who have signed the proposed
  amendments! In spite of the fact that the majority so
  rapidly came to be on our side, the difficulties confronting
  us after our victory were very great. Nevertheless we won
  through because we kept in mind not only our aims but also
  our principles, and did not tolerate in our Party those who
  kept silent about principles but talked of aims,
  “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition
  from passivity to activity”. Perhaps we shall be
  blamed for preferring to keep such gentlemen in prison. But
  dictatorship is impossible in any other way. We must prepare
  for dictatorship, and this consists in combating such
  phrases and such amendments. (Laughter.)
  Throughout, our theses speak of the masses. But, comrades,
  we need to understand what is meant by masses. The German
  Communist Workers’ Party, the Left-wing comrades,
  misuse this word. But Comrade Terracini, too, and all those
  who have signed these amendments, do not know how the word
  “masses” should be read.

  I have been speaking too long as it is; hence I wish to say
  only a few words about the concept of
  “masses”. It is one that changes in accordance
  with the changes in the nature of the struggle. At the
  beginning of the struggle it took only a few thousand
  genuinely revolutionary workers to warrant talk of the
  masses. If the party succeeds in drawing into the struggle
  not only its own members, if it also succeeds in arousing
  non-party people, it is well on the way to winning the
  masses. During our revolutions there were instances when
  several thousand workers represented the masses. In the
  history of our movement, and of our struggle against the
  Mensheviks, you will find many examples where several
  thousand workers in a town were enough to give a clearly
  mass character to the movement. You have a mass when several
  thousand non-party workers, who  usually live a philistine
  life and drag out a miserable existence, and who have never
  heard anything about politics, begin to act in a
  revolutionary way. If the movement spreads and intensifies,
  it gradually develops into a real revolution. We saw this in
  1905 and 1917 during three revolutions, and you too will
  have to go through all this. When the revolution has been
  sufficiently prepared, the concept “masses”
  becomes different: several thousand workers no longer
  constitute the masses. This word begins to denote something
  else. The concept of “masses” undergoes a change
  so that it implies the majority, and not simply a majority
  of the workers alone, but the majority of all the
  exploited. Any other kind of interpretation is impermissible
  for a revolutionary, and any other sense of the word becomes
  incomprehensible. It is possible that even a small party,
  the British or American party, for example, after it has
  thoroughly studied the course of political development and
  become acquainted with the life and customs of the non party
  masses, will at a favourable moment evoke a revolutionary
  movement  (Comrade Radek has pointed to the miners’
  strike as a good example[15]). You will
  have a mass movement if such a party comes forward with its
  slogans at such a moment and succeeds in getting millions of
  workers to follow it. I would not altogether deny that a
  revolution can be started by a very small party and brought
  to a victorious conclusion. But one must have a knowledge of
  the methods by which the masses can be won over. For this
  thoroughgoing preparation of revolution is essential. But
  here you have comrades coming forward with the assertion
  that we should immediately give up the demand for
  “big” masses. They must be challenged. Without
  thoroughgoing preparation you will not achieve victory in
  any country. Quite a small party is sufficient to lead the
  masses. At certain times there is no necessity for big
  organisations.

  But to win, we must have the sympathy of the masses. An
  absolute majority is not always essential; but what is
  essential to win and retain power is not only the majority
  of the working class—I use the term “working
  class” in its West-European sense, i.e., in the sense
  of the industrial proletariat—but also the majority of
  the working and exploited rural population. Have you thought
  about this?

  Do we find in Terracini’s speech even a hint at this
  thought? He speaks only of “dynamic tendency”
  and the “transition from passivity to
  activity”. Does he devote even a single word to the
  food question? And yet the workers demand their victuals,
  although they can put up with a great deal and go hungry, as
  we have seen to a certain extent in Russia. We must,
  therefore, win over to our side not only the majority of the
  working class, but also the majority of the working and
  exploited rural population. Have you prepared for this?
  Almost nowhere.

  And so, I repeat: I must unreservedly defend our theses and
  I feel I am bound to do it. We not only condemned the
  Centrists but expelled them from the Party. Now we must deal
  with another aspect, which we also consider dangerous. We
  must tell the comrades the truth in the most polite form
  (and in our theses it is told in a kind and considerate way)
  so that no one feels insulted: we are confronted now by
  other, more important questions than that of attacks on the
  Centrists. We have had enough of this question. It has
  already become somewhat boring. Instead, the comrades ought
  to learn to wage a real revolutionary struggle. The German
  workers have already begun this. Hundreds of thousands of
  proletarians in that country have been fighting
  heroically. Anyone who opposes this struggle should be
  immediately expelled. But after that we must not engage in
  empty word-spinning but must immediately begin to learn, on
  the basis of the mistakes made, how to organise the struggle
  better. We must not conceal our mistakes from the
  enemy. Anyone who is afraid of this is no revolutionary. On
  the contrary, if we openly declare to the workers:
  “Yes, we have made mistakes”, it will mean that
  they will not be repeated and we shall be able better to
  choose the moment. And if during the struggle itself the
  majority of the working people prove to be on our
  side—not only the majority of the workers, but the
  majority of all the exploited and oppressed—then we
  shall really be victorious. (Prolonged, stormy
  applause.)

  Report On The Tactics Of The R.C.P.
  July 5

  Comrades, strictly speaking I was unable to prepare properly
  for this report. All that I was able to prepare for you in
  the way of systematic material was a translation of my
  pamphlet on the tax in kind and the theses on the tactics of
  the Russian Communist Party. To this I merely want to add a
  few explanations and remarks.

  I think that to explain our Party’s tactics we must
  first of all examine the international
  situation. We have already had a detailed discussion of
  the economic position of capitalism  internationally, and
  the Congress has adopted definite resolutions on this
  subject.[16] I deal with this subject in my
  theses very briefly, and only from the political stand
  point. I leave aside the economic basis, but I think that in
  discussing the international position of our Republic we
  must, politically, take into account the fact that a certain
  equilibrium has now undoubtedly set in between the forces
  that have been waging an open, armed struggle against each
  other for the supremacy of this or that leading class. It is
  an equilibrium between bourgeois society, the international
  bourgeoisie as a whole, and Soviet Russia. It is, of course,
  an equilibrium only in a limited sense. It is only in
  respect to this military struggle, I say, that a certain
  equilibrium has been brought about in the international
  situation. It must be emphasised, of course, that this is
  only a relative equilibrium, and a very unstable one. Much
  inflammable material has accumulated in capitalist
  countries, as well as in those countries which up to now
  have been regarded merely as the objects and not as the
  subjects of history, i.e., the colonies and
  semi-colonies. It is quite possible, therefore, that
  insurrections, great battles and  revolutions may break out
  there sooner or later, and very suddenly too. During the
  past few years we have witnessed the direct struggle waged
  by the international bourgeoisie against the first
  proletarian republic. This struggle has been at the centre
  of the world political situation, and it is there that a
  change has taken place. Inasmuch as the attempt of the
  international bourgeoisie to strangle our Republic has
  failed, an equilibrium has set in, and a very unstable one
  it is, of course.

  We know perfectly well, of course, that the international
  bourgeoisie is at present much stronger than our Republic,
  and that it is only the peculiar combination of
  circumstances that is preventing it from continuing the war
  against us. For several weeks now, we have witnessed fresh
  attempts in the Far East to renew the invasion,[17]
  and there is not the slightest doubt that similar attempts
  will continue. Our Party has no doubts whatever on that
  score. The important thing for us is to establish that an
  unstable equilibrium does exist, and that we must take
  advantage of this respite, taking into consideration the
  characteristic features of the present situation, adapting
  our tactics to the specific features of this situation, and
  never forgetting that the necessity for armed struggle may
  arise again quite suddenly. Our task is still to organise
  and build up the Red Army. In connection with the food
  problem, too, we must continue to think first of all of our
  Red Army. We can adopt no other line in the present
  international situation, when we must still be prepared for
  fresh attacks and fresh attempts at invasion on the part of
  the international bourgeoisie. In regard to our practical
  policy, however, the fact that a certain equilibrium has
  been reached in the international situation has some
  significance, but only in the sense that we must admit that,
  although the revolutionary movement has made-progress, the
  development of the international revolution this year has
  not proceeded along as straight a line as we had
  expected.

  When we started the international revolution, we did so not
  because we were convinced that we could forestall its
  development, but because a number of circumstances compelled
  us to start it. We thought: either the international
  revolution comes to our assistance, and in that case our
  victory will be fully assured, or we shall do our modest
  revolutionary work in the conviction that even in the event
  of defeat we shall have served the cause of the revolution
  and that our experience will benefit other revolutions. It
  was clear to us that without the support of the
  international world revolution the victory of the
  proletarian revolution was impossible. Before the
  revolution, and even after it, we thought: either revolution
  breaks out in the other countries, in the capitalistically
  more developed countries, immediately, or at least very
  quickly, or we must perish. In spite of this conviction, we
  did all we possibly could to preserve the Soviet system
  under all circumstances, come what may, because we knew that
  we were not only working for ourselves, but also for the
  international revolution. We knew this, we repeatedly
  expressed this conviction before the October Revolution,
  immediately after it, and at the time we signed the
  Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. And, generally speaking, this
  was correct.

  Actually, however, events did not proceed along as straight
  a line as we had expected. In the other big,
  capitalistically more developed countries the revolution has
  not broken out to this day. True, we can say with
  satisfaction that the revolution is developing all over the
  world, and it is only thanks to this that the international
  bourgeoisie is unable to strangle us, inspite of the fact
  that, militarily and economically, it is a hundred times
  stronger than we are. (Applause.)

  In Paragraph 2 of the theses I examine the manner in which
  this situation arose, and the conclusions that must be drawn
  from it. Let me add that my final conclusion is the
  following: the development of the international revolution,
  which we predicted, is proceeding, but not along as straight
  a line as we had expected. It becomes clear at the first
  glance that after the conclusion of peace, bad as it was, it
  proved impossible to call forth revolution in other
  capitalist countries, although we know that the signs of
  revolution were very considerable and numerous, in fact,
  much more considerable and numerous than we thought at the
  time. Pamphlets are now beginning to appear which tell us
  that during the past few years and months these
  revolutionary symptoms in Europe have been much more serious
  than we had suspected. What, in that case, must we do now?
  We must now thoroughly prepare for revolution and make a
  deep study of its concrete development in the advanced
  capitalist countries. This is the first lesson we must draw
  from the international situation. As for our Russian
  Republic, we must take advantage of this brief respite in
  order to adapt our tactics to this zigzag line of
  history. This equilibrium is very important politically,
  because we clearly see that in many West-European countries,
  where the broad mass of the working class, and possibly the
  overwhelming majority of the population, are organised, the
  main bulwark of the bourgeoisie consists of the hostile
  working-class organisations affiliated to the Second and the
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals. I speak of this in Paragraph
  2 of the theses, and I think that in this connection I need
  deal with only two points, which were discussed during the
  debate on the question of tactics. First, winning over the
  majority of the proletariat. The more organised the
  proletariat is in a capitalistically developed country, the
  greater thoroughness does history demand of us in preparing
  for revolution, and the more thoroughly must we win over the
  majority of the working class. Second, the main bulwark of
  capitalism in the industrially developed capitalist
  countries is the part of the working class that is organised
  in the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals. But for
  the support of this section of the workers, these
  counter-revolutionary elements within the working class, the
  international bourgeoisie would be altogether unable to
  retain its position. (Applause.)

  Here I would also like to emphasise the significance of
  the movement in the colonies. In this respect we
  see in all the old parties, in all the bourgeois and
  petty-bourgeois labour parties affiliated to the Second and
  the Two-and-a Half Internationals, survivals of the old
  sentimental views: they insist on their profound sympathy
  for oppressed colonial and semi-colonial peoples. The
  movement in the colonial countries is still regarded as an
  insignificant national and totally peaceful movement. But
  this is not so. It has undergone great change since the
  beginning of the twentieth century: millions and hundreds of
  millions, in fact the overwhelming majority of the
  population of the globe, are  now coming forward as
  independent, active and revolutionary factors. It is
  perfectly clear that in the impending decisive battles in
  the world revolution, the movement of the majority of the
  population of the globe, initially directed towards national
  liberation, will turn against capitalism and imperialism and
  will, perhaps, play a much more revolutionary part than we
  expect. It is important to emphasise the fact that, for the
  first time in our International, we have taken up the
  question of preparing for this struggle. Of course, there
  are many more difficulties in this enormous sphere than in
  any other, but at all events the movement is advancing. And
  in spite of the fact that the masses of toilers—the
  peasants in the colonial countries—are still backward,
  they will play a very important revolutionary part in the
  coming phases of the world revolution. (Animated
  approval.)

  As regards the internal political position of our Republic I
  must start with a close examination of class
  relationships. During the past few months changes have taken
  place in this sphere, and we have witnessed the formation of
  new organisations of the exploiting class directed against
  us. The aim of socialism is to abolish classes. In the front
  ranks of the exploiting class we find the big landowners and
  the industrial capitalists. In regard to them, the work of
  destruction is fairly easy; it can be completed within a few
  months, and sometimes even a few weeks or days. We in Russia
  have expropriated our exploiters, the big landowners as well
  as the capitalists. They had no organisations of their own
  during the war and operated merely as the appendages of the
  military forces of the international bourgeoisie. Now, after
  we have repulsed the attacks of the international
  counter-revolution, organisations of the Russian bourgeoisie
  and of all the Russian counter-revolutionary parties have
  been formed abroad. The number of Russian émigrés
  scattered in all foreign countries may be estimated at one
  and a half to two millions. In nearly every country they
  publish daily newspapers, and all the parties, landowner and
  petty-bourgeois, not excluding the Socialist-Revolutionaries
  and Mensheviks, have numerous ties with foreign bourgeois
  elements, that is to say, they obtain enough money to run
  their own press. We find the collaboration abroad of
  absolutely all the political parties that formerly existed
  in Russia, and we see how the “free” Russian
  press abroad, from the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
  press to the most reactionary monarchist press, is
  championing the great landed interests. This, to a certain
  extent, facilitates our task, because we can more easily
  observe the forces of the enemy, his state of organisation,
  and the political trends in his camp. On the other hand, of
  course, it hinders our work, because these Russian
  counter-revolutionary émigrés use every means at
  their disposal to prepare for a fight against us. This fight
  again shows that, taken as a whole, the class instinct and
  class-consciousness of the ruling classes are still superior
  to those of the oppressed classes, notwithstanding the fact
  that the Russian revolution has done more than any previous
  revolution in this respect. In Russia, there is hardly a
  village in which the people, the oppressed, have not been
  roused. Nevertheless, if we take a cool look at the state of
  organisation and political clarity of views of the Russian
  counter-revolutionary émigrés, we shall find that
  the class-consciousness of the bourgeoisie is still superior
  to that of the exploited and the oppressed. These people
  make every possible attempt and skilfully take advantage of
  every opportunity to attack Soviet Russia in one way or
  another, and to dismember it. It would be very
  instructive—and I think the foreign comrades will do
  that—systematically to watch the most important
  aspirations, the most important tactical moves, and the most
  important trends of this Russian counter-revolution. It
  operates chiefly abroad, and it will not be very difficult
  for the foreign comrades to watch it. In some respects, we
  ought to learn from this enemy. These counter-revolutionary
  émigrés are very well informed, they are
  excellently organised and are good strategists. And I think
  that a systematic comparison and study of the manner in
  which they are organised and take advantage of every
  opportunity may have a powerful propaganda effect upon the
  working class. This is not general theory, it is practical
  politics; here we can see what the enemy has learned. During
  the past few years, the Russian bourgeoisie has suffered a
  terrible defeat. There is an old saying that a beaten army
  learns a great deal. The beaten reactionary army has learned
  a  great deal, and has learned it thoroughly. It is learning
  with great avidity, and has really made much headway. When
  we took power at one swoop, the Russian bourgeoisie was
  unorganised and politically undeveloped. Now, I think, its
  development is on a par with modern, West-European
  development. We must take this into account, we must improve
  our own organisation and methods, and we shall do our utmost
  to achieve this. It was relatively easy for us, and I think
  that it will be equally easy for other revolutions, to cope
  with these two exploiting classes.

  But, in addition to this class of exploiters, there is in
  nearly all capitalist countries, with the exception,
  perhaps, of Britain, a class of small producers and small
  farmers. The main problem of the revolution now is how to
  fight these two classes. In order to be rid of them, we must
  adopt methods other than those employed against the big
  landowners and capitalists. We could simply expropriate and
  expel both of these classes, and that is what we did. But we
  cannot do the same thing with the remaining capitalist
  classes, the small producers and the petty bourgeoisie,
  which are found in all countries. In most capitalist
  countries, these classes constitute a very considerable
  minority, approximately from thirty to forty-five per cent
  of the population. Add to them the petty-bourgeois elements
  of the working class, and you get even more than fifty per
  cent. These cannot be expropriated or expelled; other
  methods of struggle must be adopted in their case. From the
  international standpoint, if we regard the international
  revolution as one process, the significance of the period
  into which we are now entering in Russia is, in essence,
  that we must now find a practical solution for the problem
  of the relations the proletariat should establish with this
  last capitalist class in Russia. All Marxists have a correct
  and ready solution for this problem in theory. But theory
  and practice are two different things, and the practical
  solution of this problem is by no means the same as the
  theoretical solution. We know definitely that we have made
  serious mistakes. From the international standpoint, it is a
  sign of great progress that we are now trying to determine
  the attitude the proletariat in power should adopt towards
  the last capitalist class—the rock-bottom  of
  capitalism—small private property, the small
  producer. This problem now confronts us in a practical
  way. I think we shall solve it. At all events, the
  experiment we are making will be useful for future
  proletarian revolutions, and they will be able to make
  better technical preparations for solving it.

  In my theses I tried to analyse the problem of the
  relations between the proletariat and the
  peasantry. For the first time in history there is a
  state with only two classes, the proletariat and the
  peasantry. The latter constitutes the overwhelming majority
  of the population. It is, of course, very backward. How do
  the relations between the peasantry and the proletariat,
  which holds political power, find practical expression in
  the development of the revolution? The first form is
  alliance, close alliance. This is a very difficult task, but
  at any rate it is economically and politically feasible.

  How did we approach this problem practically? We concluded
  an alliance with the peasantry. We interpret this alliance
  in the following way: the proletariat emancipates the
  peasantry from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie, from its
  leadership and influence, and wins it over to its own side
  in order jointly to defeat the exploiters.

  The Menshevik argument runs like this: the peasantry
  constitutes a majority; we are pure democrats, therefore,
  the majority should decide. But as the peasantry cannot
  operate on its own, this, in practice, means nothing more
  nor less than the restoration of capitalism. The slogan is
  the same: Alliance with the peasantry. When we say that, we
  mean strengthening and consolidating the proletariat: We
  have tried to give effect to this alliance between the
  proletariat and the peasantry, and the first stage was a
  military alliance. The three years of the Civil War created
  enormous difficulties, but in certain respects they
  facilitated our task. This may-sound odd, but it is
  true. The war was not something new for the peasants; a war
  against the exploiters, against the big landowners, was
  something they quite understood. The overwhelming majority
  of the peasants were on our side. In spite of the enormous
  distances, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of
  our peasants are unable to read or write, they assimilated
  our propaganda very easily. This proves that the broad
  masses—and  this applies also to the most advanced
  countries—learn faster from their own practical
  experience than from books. In Russia, moreover, learning
  from practical experience was facilitated for the peasantry
  by the fact that the country is so exceptionally large that
  in the same period different parts of it were passing
  through different stages of development.

  In Siberia and in the Ukraine the counter-revolution was
  able to gain a temporary victory because there the
  bourgeoisie had the peasantry on its side, because the
  peasants were against us. The peasants frequently said,
  “We are Bolsheviks, but not Communists. We are for the
  Bolsheviks because they drove out the landowners; but we are
  not for the Communists because they are opposed to
  individual farming.” And for a time, the
  counter-revolution managed to win out in Siberia and in the
  Ukraine because the bourgeoisie made headway in the struggle
  for influence over the peasantry. But it took only a very
  short time to open the peasants’ eyes. They quickly
  acquired practical experience and soon said, “Yes, the
  Bolsheviks are rather unpleasant people, we don’t like
  them, but still they are better than the whiteguards and the
  Constituent Assembly.” “Constituent
  Assembly” is a term of abuse not only among the
  educated Communists, but also among the peasants. They know
  from practical experience that the Constituent Assembly and
  the whiteguards stand for the same thing, that the former is
  inevitably followed by the latter. The Mensheviks also
  resort to a military alliance with the peasantry, but they
  fail to understand that a military alliance alone is
  inadequate. There can be no military alliance without an
  economic alliance. It takes more than air to keep a man
  alive; our alliance with the peasantry could not possibly
  have lasted any length of time without the economic
  foundation, which was the basis of our victory in the war
  against our bourgeoisie. After all our bourgeoisie has
  united with the whole of the international bourgeoisie.

  The basis of our economic alliance with the peasantry was,
  of course, very simple, and even crude. The peasant obtained
  from us all the land and support against the big
  landowners. In return for this, we were to obtain food. This
  alliance was something entirely new and did not rest on the
  ordinary relations between commodity producers and
  consumers. Our peasants had a much better understanding of
  this than the heroes of the Second and the Two-and a-Half
  Internationals. They said to themselves, “These
  Bolsheviks are stern leaders, but after all they are our own
  people.” Be that as it may, we created in this way the
  foundations of a new economic alliance. The peasants gave
  their produce to the Red Army and received from the latter
  assistance in protecting their possessions. This is always
  forgotten by the heroes of the Second International, who,
  like Otto Bauer, totally fail to understand the actual
  situation. We confess that the initial form of this alliance
  was very primitive and that we made very many mistakes. But
  we were obliged to act as quickly as possible, we had to
  organise supplies for the army at all costs. During the
  Civil War we were cut off from all the grain districts of
  Russia. We were in a terrible position, and it looks like a
  miracle that the Russian people and the working class were
  able to endure such suffering, want, and privation,
  sustained by nothing more than a deep urge for
  victory. (Animated approval and applause.)

  When the Civil War came to an end, however, we faced a
  different problem. If the country had not been so laid waste
  after seven years of incessant war, it would, perhaps, have
  been possible to find an easier transition to the new form
  of alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. But
  bad as conditions in the country were, they were still
  further aggravated by the crop failure, the fodder shortage,
  etc. In consequence, the sufferings of the peasants became
  unbearable. We had to show the broad masses of the peasants
  immediately that we were prepared to change our policy,
  without in any way deviating from our revolutionary path, so
  that they could say, “The Bolsheviks want to improve
  our intolerable condition immediately, and at all
  costs.”

  And so, our economic policy was changed; the tax in
  kind superseded the requisitions. This was not invented at
  one stroke. You will find a number of proposals in the
  Bolshevik press over a period of months, but no plan that
  really promised success. But this is not important. The
  important  thing is that we changed our, economic policy,
  yielding to exclusively practical considerations, and
  impelled by necessity. A bad harvest, fodder shortage and
  lack of fuel—all, of course, have a decisive influence
  on the economy as a whole, including the peasant economy. If
  the peasantry goes on strike, we get no firewood; and if we
  get no firewood, the factories will have to idle. Thus, in
  the spring of 1921, the economic crisis resulting from the
  terrible crop failure and the fodder shortage assumed
  gigantic proportions. All that was the aftermath of the
  three years of civil war. We had to show the peasantry that
  we could and would quickly change our policy in order
  immediately to alleviate their distress. We have always
  said—and it was also said at the Second
  Congress—that revolution demands sacrifices. Some
  comrades in their propaganda argue in the following way: we
  are prepared to stage a revolution, but it must not be too
  severe. Unless I am mistaken, this thesis was put forward by
  Comrade Smeral in his speech at the Congress of the
  Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.  I read about it in the
  report published in the Reichenberg Vorwärts[18] There is evidently a Leftist
  wing there; hence this source cannot be regarded as being
  quite impartial. At all events, I must say that if Smeral
  did say that, he was wrong. Some comrades who spoke after
  Smeral at this Congress said, “Yes, we shall go along
  with Smeral because in this way we shall avoid civil
  war.” (Laughter.) If these reports are true,
  I must say that such agitation is neither communistic nor
  revolutionary. Naturally, every revolution entails enormous
  sacrifice on the part of the class making it. Revolution
  differs from ordinary struggle in that ten and even a
  hundred times more people take part in it. Hence every
  revolution entails sacrifices not only for individuals, but
  for a whole class. The dictatorship of the proletariat in
  Russia has entailed for the ruling class—the
  proletariat—sacrifices, want and privation
  unprecedented in history, and the case will, in all
  probability, be the same in every other country.

  The question arises: How are we to distribute this burden of
  privation? We are the state power. We are able to distribute
  the burden of privation to a certain extent, and to impose
  it upon several classes, thereby relatively alleviating the
  condition of certain strata of the population.

  But what is to be our principle? Is it to be that of
  fairness, or of majority? No. We must act in a practical
  manner. We must distribute the burdens in such a way as to
  preserve the power of the proletariat. This is our only
  principle. In the beginning of the revolution the working
  class was compelled to suffer incredible want. Let me state
  that from year to year our food policy has been achieving
  increasing success. And the situation as a whole has
  undoubtedly improved. But the peasantry in Russia has
  certainly gained more from the revolution than the working
  class. There is no doubt about that at all. From the
  standpoint of theory, this shows, of course, that our
  revolution was to some degree a bourgeois revolution. When
  Kautsky used this as an argument against us, we
  laughed. Naturally, a revolution which does not expropriate
  the big landed estates, expel the big landowners or divide
  the land is only a bourgeois revolution and not a socialist
  one. But we were the only party to carry the bourgeois
  revolution to its conclusion and to facilitate the struggle
  for the socialist revolution. The Soviet power and the
  Soviet system are institutions of the socialist state. We
  have already established these institutions, but we have not
  yet solved the problem of economic relations between the
  peasantry and the proletariat. Much remains to be done, and
  the outcome of this struggle depends upon whether we solve
  this problem or not. Thus, the distribution of the burden of
  privation is one of the most difficult practical
  problems. On the whole, the condition of the peasants has
  improved, but dire suffering has fallen to the lot of the
  working class, precisely because it is exercising its
  dictatorship.

  I have already said that in the spring of 1921 the most
  appalling want caused by the fodder shortage and the crop
  failure prevailed among the peasantry, which constitutes the
  majority of our population. We cannot possibly exist unless
  we have good relations with the peasant masses. Hence, our
  task was to render them immediate assistance. The condition
  of the working class is extremely hard. It is suffering
  horribly. Those who have more political understanding,
  however, realise that in the interest of the dictatorship of
  the working class we must make tremendous efforts to help
  the peasants at any price. The vanguard of the  working
  class has realised this, but in that vanguard there are
  still people who cannot understand it, and who are too weary
  to understand it. They regarded it as a mistake and began to
  use the word “opportunism”. They said,
  “The Bolsheviks are helping the peasants. The
  peasants, who are exploiting us, are getting everything they
  please, while the workers are starving.” But is that
  opportunism? We are helping the peasants because without an
  alliance with them the political power of the proletariat is
  impossible, its preservation is inconceivable. It was this
  consideration of expediency and not that of fair
  distribution that was decisive for us. We are assisting the
  peasants because it is absolutely necessary to do so in
  order that we may retain political power. The supreme
  principle of the dictatorship is the maintenance of the
  alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry in order
  that the proletariat may retain its leading role and its
  political power.

  The only means we found for this was the adoption of the tax
  in kind, which was the inevitable consequence of the
  struggle. This year, we shall introduce this tax for the
  first time. This principle has not yet been tried in
  practice. From the military alliance we must pass to an
  economic alliance, and, theoretically, the only basis for
  the latter is the introduction of the tax in kind. It
  provides the only theoretical possibility for laying a
  really solid economic foundation for socialist society. The
  socialised factory gives the peasant its manufactures and in
  return the peasant gives his grain. This is the only
  possible form of existence of socialist society, the only
  form of socialist development in a country in which the
  small peasants constitute the majority, or at all events a
  very considerable minority. The peasants will give one part
  of their produce in the form of tax and another either in
  exchange for the manufactures of socialist factories, or
  through the exchange of commodities.

  This brings us to the most difficult problem. It goes
  without saying that the tax in kind means freedom to
  trade. After having paid the tax in kind, the peasant will
  have the right freely to exchange the remainder of his
  grain. This freedom of exchange implies freedom for
  capitalism. We say this openly and emphasise it. We do not
  conceal it in the least. Things would go very hard with us
  if we  attempted to conceal it. Freedom to trade means
  freedom for capitalism, but it also means a new form of
  capitalism. It means that, to a certain extent, we are
  re-creating capitalism. We are doing this quite openly. It
  is state capitalism. But state capitalism in a society where
  power belongs to capital, and state capitalism in a
  proletarian state, are two different concepts. In a
  capitalist state, state capitalism means that it is
  recognised by the state and controlled by it for the benefit
  of the bourgeoisie, and to the detriment of the
  proletariat. In the proletarian state, the same thing is
  done for the benefit of the working class, for the purpose
  of withstanding the as yet strong bourgeoisie, and of
  fighting it. It goes without saying that we must grant
  concessions to the foreign bourgeoisie, to foreign
  capital. Without the slightest denationalisation, we shall
  lease mines, forests and oilfields to foreign capitalists,
  and receive in exchange manufactured goods, machinery, etc.,
  and thus restore our own industry.

  Of course, we did not all agree on the question of state
  capitalism at once. But we are very pleased to note in this
  connection that our peasantry has been developing, that it
  has fully realised the historical significance of the
  struggle we are waging at the present time. Ordinary
  peasants from the most remote districts have come to us and
  said: “What! We have expelled our capitalists, the
  capitalists who speak Russian, and now foreign capitalists
  are coming!” Does not this show that our peasants have
  developed? There is no need to explain to a worker who is
  versed in economics why this is necessary. We have been so
  ruined by seven years of war that it will take many years to
  restore our industry. We must pay for our backwardness and
  weakness, and for the lessons we are now learning and must
  learn. Those who want to learn must pay for the tuition. We
  must explain this to one and all, and if we prove it in
  practice, the vast masses of the peasants and workers will
  agree with us, because in this way their condition will be
  immediately improved, and because it will ensure the
  possibility of restoring our industry. What compels us to do
  this? We are not alone in the world.  We exist in a system
  of capitalist states. [19]. . . On one
  side, there are the colonial countries, but they cannot help
  us yet. On the other side, there are the  capitalist
  countries, but they are our enemies. The result is a certain
  equilibrium, a very poor one, it is true. Nevertheless, we
  must reckon with the fact. We must not shut our eyes to it
  if we want to exist. Either we score an immediate victory
  over the whole bourgeoisie, or we pay the tribute.

  We admit quite openly, and do not conceal the fact, that
  concessions in the system of state capitalism mean paying
  tribute to capitalism. But we gain time, and gaining time
  means gaining everything, particularly in the period of
  equilibrium, when our foreign comrades are preparing
  thoroughly for their revolution. The more thorough their
  preparations, the more certain will the victory
  be. Meanwhile, however, we shall have to pay the
  tribute.

  A few words about our food policy. Undoubtedly, it was a bad
  and primitive policy. But we can also point to some
  achievements. In this connection I must once again emphasise
  that the only possible economic foundation of socialism is
  large-scale machine industry. Whoever forgets this is no
  Communist. We must analyse this problem concretely. We
  cannot present problems in the way the theoreticians of the
  old school of socialism do. We must present them in a
  practical manner. What is modern large-scale industry? It is
  the electrification of the whole of Russia. Sweden, Germany
  and America have almost achieved this, although they are
  still bourgeois. A Swedish comrade told me that in Sweden a
  large part of industry and thirty per cent of agriculture
  are electrified. In Germany and America, which are even more
  developed capitalistically, we see the same thing on a
  larger scale. Large-scale machine industry is nothing more
  nor less than the electrification of the whole country. We
  have already appointed a special commission consisting of
  the country’s best economists and engineers. It is
  true that nearly all of them are hostile to the Soviet
  power. All these specialists will come over to communism,
  but not our way, not by way of twenty years of underground
  work, during which we unceasingly studied and repeated over
  and over again the ABC of communism.

  Nearly all the Soviet government bodies were in favour of
  inviting the specialists. The expert engineers will come to
  us when we give them practical proof that this will
  increase the country’s productive forces. It is not
  enough to prove it to them in theory; we must prove it to
  them in practice, and we shall win these people over to our
  side if we present the problem differently, not from the
  standpoint of the theoretical propaganda of communism. We
  say: large-scale industry is the only means of saving the
  peasantry from want and starvation. Everyone agrees with
  this. But how can it be done? The restoration of industry on
  the old basis will entail too much labour and time. We must
  give industry a more modern form, i.e., we must adopt
  electrification. This will take much less time. We have
  already drawn up the plans for electrification. More than
  two hundred specialists—almost to a man opposed to the
  Soviet power—worked on it with keen interest, although
  they are not Communists. From the standpoint of technical
  science, however, they had to admit that this was the only
  correct way. Of course, we have a long way to go before the
  plan is achieved. The cautious specialists say that the
  first series of works will take at least ten
  years. Professor Ballod has estimated that it would take
  three to four years to electrify Germany. But for us even
  ten years is not enough. In my theses I quote actual figures
  to show you how little we have been able to do in this
  sphere up to now. The figures I quote are so modest that it
  immediately becomes clear that they are more of propaganda
  than scientific value. But we must begin with
  propaganda. The Russian peasants who fought in the world war
  and lived in Germany for several years learned how modern
  farming should be carried on in order to conquer famine. We
  must carry on extensive propaganda in this direction. Taken
  by themselves, these plans are not yet of great practical
  value, but their propaganda value is very great.

  The peasants realise that something new must be
  created. They realise that this cannot be done by everybody
  working separately, but by the state working as a whole. The
  peasants who were prisoners of war in Germany found out what
  real cultural life is based on. Twelve thousand kilowatts is
  a very modest beginning. This may sound funny to the
  foreigner who is familiar with electrification in America,
  Germany or Sweden. But he laughs best who laughs last. It
  is, indeed, a modest beginning. But the peasants are
  beginning to understand that new work must be carried out on
  a grand scale, and that this work has already
  begun. Enormous difficulties will have to be overcome. We
  shall try to establish relations with the capitalist
  countries. We must not regret having to give the capitalists
  several hundred million kilogrammes of oil on condition that
  they help us to electrify our country.

  And now, in conclusion, a few words about “pure
  democracy”. I will read you a passage from
  Engels’s letter to Bebel of December 11, 1884. He
  wrote:

  “Pure democracy . . . when the moment of revolution
  comes, acquires a temporary importance as the extreme
  bourgeois party, as which it already played itself off in
  Frankfort, and as the final sheet-anchor of the whole
  bourgeois and even feudal economy. . . . Thus between March
  and September 1848 the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass
  strengthened the liberals in order to hold down the
  revolutionary masses. . . . In any case our sole adversary
  on the day of the crisis and on the day after the crisis
  will be the whole of the reaction which will group
  around pure democracy, and this, I think, should not be
  lost sight of.”

  Our approach must differ from that of the theoreticians. The
  whole reactionary mass, not only bourgeois, but also feudal,
  groups itself around “pure democracy”. The
  German comrades know better than anyone else what
  “pure democracy” means, for Kautsky and the
  other leaders of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half
  Internationals are defending this “pure
  democracy” from the wicked Bolsheviks. If we judge the
  Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, not by
  what they say, but by what they do, we shall find that they
  are nothing but representatives of petty bourgeois
  “pure democracy”. In the course of our
  revolution they have given us a classic example of what
  “pure democracy” means, and again during the
  recent crisis, in the days of the Kronstadt mutiny. There
  was serious unrest among the peasantry, and discontent was
  also rife among the workers. They were weary and
  exhausted. After all, there is a limit to human
  endurance. They had starved for three years, but you cannot
  go on starving for four or five years. Naturally, hunger has
  a tremendous influence on political activity. How did the
  Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks  behave? They
  wavered all the time, thereby strengthening the
  bourgeoisie. The organisation of all the Russian parties
  abroad has revealed the present state of affairs. The
  shrewdest of the leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie said
  to themselves: “We cannot achieve victory in Russia
  immediately. Hence our slogan must be: ‘Soviets
  without the Bolsheviks.’” Milyukov, the leader
  of the Constitutional-Democrats, defended the Soviet power
  from the attacks of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. This
  sounds very strange; but such are the practical dialectics
  which we, in our revolution, have been studying in a
  peculiar way, from the practical experience of our struggle
  and of the struggle of our enemies. The
  Constitutional-Democrats defend “Soviets without the
  Bolsheviks” because they understand the position very
  well and hope that a section of the people will rise to the
  bait. That is what the clever Constitutional-Democrats
  say. Not all the Constitutional-Democrats are clever, of
  course, but some of them are, and these have learned
  something from the French Revolution. The present slogan is
  to fight the Bolsheviks, whatever the price, come what
  may. The whole of the bourgeoisie is now helping the
  Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are now the
  vanguard of all reaction. In the spring we had a taste of
  the fruits  of this counter-revolutionary co-operation. [20]

  That is why we must continue our relentless struggle against
  these elements. Dictatorship is a state of intense war. That
  is just the state we are in. There is no military invasion
  at present; but we are isolated. On the other hand, however,
  we are not entirely isolated, since the whole international
  bourgeoisie is incapable of waging open war against us just
  now, because the whole working class, even though the
  majority is not yet communist, is sufficiently
  class-conscious to prevent intervention. The bourgeoisie is
  compelled to reckon with the temper of the masses even
  though they have not yet entirely sided with communism. That
  is why the bourgeoisie cannot now start an offensive against
  us, although one is never ruled out. Until the final issue
  is decided, this awful state of war will continue. And we
  say: “A la guerre comme à la guerre ;
  we do not promise any freedom, or any democracy.” We
  tell the peasants quite openly that they must choose between
  the rule of the  bourgeoisie, and the rule of the
  Bolsheviks—in which case we shall make every possible
  concession within the limits of retaining power, and later
  we shall lead them to socialism. Everything else is
  deception and pure demagogy. Ruthless war must be declared
  against this deception and demagogy. Our point of view is:
  for the time being—big concessions and the greatest
  caution, precisely because a certain equilibrium has set in,
  precisely because we are weaker than our combined enemies,
  and because our economic basis is too weak and we need a
  stronger one.

  That, comrades, is what I wanted to tell you about our
  tactics, the tactics of the Russian Communist
  Party. (Prolonged applause.)

[1] The Third
  Congress was held in Moscow from June 22 to July 12,
  1921. Its 605 delegates (291 with voice and vote, and 314
  with voice only) represented 103 organisations from 52
  countries, namely: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist
  Parties, 28 Youth Leagues, 4 syndicalist organisations, 2
  opposition Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’
  Party of Gemany and the Workers’ Communist Party of
  Spain) and 13 other organisations. The 72 delegates from the
  Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks were headed by
  Lenin.

  The Congress discussed the world economic crisis and the new
  tasks of the Communist International; the report on the
  activity of the Executive Committee of the Communist
  International; the Communist Workers’ Party of
  Germany, the Italian question; the tactics of the Communist
  International the attitude of the Red International Council
  of Trade Unions to the Communist International; the struggle
  against the Amsterdam International; the tactics of the
  R.C.P.(B.); the Communist International and the Communist
  youth movement; the women’s movement; the United
  Communist Party of Germany, etc.

  Lenin directed preparations for and the activities of the
  Congress; he was elected its Honorary Chairman; he took part
  in drafting all the key resolutions; he gave a report on the
  tactics of the R.C.P.(B.); he spoke in defence of the
  Communist International’s tactics, on the Italian
  question; in the commissions and at the enlarged sittings of
  the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and at the
  delegates’ meetings. Before and during the Congress,
  Lenin met and talked with delegates about the state of
  affairs in the Communist Parties.

  The Third Congress had a great influence on the formation
  and development of young Communist Parties. It paid great
  attention to the Comintern’s organisation and tactics
  in the new conditions of the world communist movement. Lenin
  had to combat the Centrist deviation and
  “Leftist” dogmatism, pseudo-revolutionary
  “Leftist” cant and sectarianism. As a result,
  revolutionary Marxism prevailed over the
  “Leftist” danger.

  In the history of the world communist movement the Third
  Congress is known for the following achievements: it worked
  out the basic tactics of the Communist Parties; it defined
  the task of winning the masses over to the side of the
  proletariat, strengthening working-class unity and
  implementing united front tactics. The most important aspect
  of its resolutions, Lenin said, was “more careful,
  more thorough preparation for fresh and more decisive
  battles, both defensive and offensive”.

[2]  On April 13,
  1919, in Amritsar, an industrial centre in Punjab, India,
  British troops fired on a mass meeting of working people who
  were protesting against the colonialist reign of
  terror. About 1,000 were killed and 2,000 wounded. The
  massacre led to popular uprisings in Punjab and other
  provinces, which were ruthlessly suppressed by the British
  colonialists.

[7]The conference
  of the reformist wing of the Italian Socialist Party, the
  so-called “socialist concentration” group, took
  place in Reggio Emilia on October 10-11, 1920. Lenin gave a
  detailed characteristic of it in his article, “On the
  Struggle Within the Italian Socialist Party”
  (Collected Works, Vol. 31, pp. 377-96).

  The report on the conference mentioned by Lenin was
  published in Corriere della Sera No. 244 and
  No. 245, of October 11 and 12, 1920, as well as in
  Avanti! No. 245 of October 13, 1920.

[8]
Avanti! (Forward! )—a daily, the
  Central Organ of the Italian Socialist Party, founded in
  Rome in December 1896. During the First World War, it took
  an inconsistently internationalist stand, and did not break
  with the reformists. In 1926, the paper was closed down by
  Mussolini’s fascist government, but continued to
  appear abroad. It resumed publication in Italy in 1943.

[9] Lenin
  apparently refers to the conference of the
  “unitary” group (Serrati, Baratono and others)
  in Florence on November 20-21, 1920 which came out against
  the break with the reformists and, with this reservation,
  for the acceptance of the 21 conditions of affiliation to
  the Communist International.

[10] In January
  1919, the Ebert-Scheidemann government dismissed the Berlin
  police chief, Eichhorn (a Left-wing Independent) who was
  very popular with the workers. This sparked off a
  workers’ protest demonstration on January 4, the day
  following Eichhorn’s retirement, and later a general
  strike and an armed uprising to overthrow the
  Ebert-Scheidemann government. The Revolutionary Committee of
  Action which headed the uprising included some Independents
  and Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck of the Communist Party
  of Germany. The Communist Party considered the uprising
  premature, but decided to support the revolutionary mass
  movement in every way. Berlin events fired the
  proletariat’s revolutionary struggle in the Rheinland,
  the Ruhr, Bremen and elsewhere.

  Alarmed by the scope of the movement, the Central Committee
  of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany
  started negotiations with the government, who used them for
  preparing a counter-revolutionary offensive. On January 11,
  its forces, led by Noske, attacked the workers and drowned
  their uprising in blood. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg,
  the leaders of the German working class, were arrested and
  killed at the height of the counter-revolutionary reign of
  terror. Workers’ action in other parts of the country
  was fiereely suppressed. 

[11] In September
  1920, Italian steelworkers occupied their mills on the
  initiative of their trade union, which was in conflict with
  the association of industrialists. The movement started in
  Turin and Milan, then spread through Piedmont and Northern
  Italy across the eountry, from the metallurgical industry to
  other industries and to agriculture. In Sicily and in other
  areas peasants occupied the land. The scope of the movement
  jeopardised the capitalist regime, but the reformist leaders
  of the Socialist Party and the trade unions, terrified by
  the political character of the movement, adopted a decision
  to confine it to within the trade unions and prevent it from
  developing into a revolution. They also decided to start
  negotiations with the industrialists.

  This was a hard blow at the Italian workers’ movement
  and showed the leaders’ inability to lead the mass
  forces. Fascism used the confusion within the working class
  to start its armed offensive in Italy.

[12] The
  amendments were proposed by the German, Austrian and Italian
  delegations to the draft theses on tactics, motioned by the
  Russian delegation at the Third Congress of the Comintern.
  They were published in German in Moskau, the organ
  of the Third Congress.

[13] The Open
  Letter (Offenor Brief) of the Central Committee of the
  United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of
  Germany, Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, the
  Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and all trade
  unions, was published in Die Rote Fahne (The
  Red Banner ) on January 8, 1921. The U.C.P.G. called on
  all workers, trade unions and socialist organisations to
  unite their forces in combating reaction and the
  capitalists’ offensive against the working
  people’s vital rights. Their programme of joint action
  included demands for higher pensions for disabled war
  veterans; elimination of unemployment; improvement of the
  country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies,
  introduction of factory and plant committee control over all
  stocks of food, raw materials and fuel restarting of all
  closed enterprises; control over sowing, harvesting and
  marketing of farm produce by the Peasants’ Councils
  together with the agricultural labourers’
  organisations; immediate disarming and dissolution of all
  bourgeois militarised organisations; establishment of
  workers’ self-defence; amnesty of all political
  prisoners; immediate re-establishment of trade and
  diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. Lenin said these
  tactics were “quite correct” (see
  Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 221).

  The Right-wing leaders of the organisations to whom the Open
  Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action
  with the Communists, despite the fact that the workers came
  out for a united front of the proletariat.

[14] The
  theory of an offensive struggle or “theory of
  the offensive” was proclaimed at the Unity Congress of
  the Communist Party of Germany and the Left-wing Independent
  Social-Democratic Party of Germany in December 1920. It
  envisaged that the party should conduct offensive tactics,
  regardless of whether there were any objective conditions
  for revolutionary activity or whether the working people
  supported the Communist Party. The theory found its
  followers among the “Leftists” in Hungary,
  Czechoslovakia, Italy, Austria, and France, and was one of
  the causes of the defeat of the March 1921 uprising in
  Germany. But the “Left ists” tried to justify
  the mistakes of the Central Committee of the U.C.P.G. The
  theses on the March uprising adopted by the U.C.P.G. Central
  Committee on April 8, 1921, reiterated that the U.C.P.G. was
  always to “follow the line of revolutionary
  offensive” and that offensive tactics, “even
  when unsuccessful, were a prerequisite of future victory and
  the only means for a revolutionary party to win over the
  masses”. At the Third Congress of the Comintern the
  followers of this theory fought to make it the basis of the
  Communist International’s resolutions on
  tactics. Lenin proved this theory to be wrong and
  adventurous, and the Congress approved his line of patient
  preparation and winning over of the majority of the working
  class to the side of the communist movement.

[17] On May 26,
  1921, in Vladivostok, the whiteguards, supported by the
  Japanese interventionists, overthrew the Maritime Regional
  Administration of the Far Eastern Republic and established a
  regime of bourgeois dictatorship and terror headed by
  industrialists, the Merkulov brothers. South Primorye became
  a spring-board for continued imperialist intervention in the
  Far East.

  The Revolutionary People’s Army of the Far Eastern
  Republic, under V. K. Blyukher, and later I. P. Uborevich,
  defeated the whiteguards, liberating Khabarovsk on February
  14, 1922, and Vladivostok on October 25, 1922. Japan had to
  withdraw her forces from the Far East. On November 14, 1922,
  the People’s Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic set
  up the Far East Revolutionary Committee with plenipotentiary
  powers to implement the union of the Far East with Soviet
  Russia. On November 15, 1922, the Presidium of the
  All-Russia Central Executive Committee issued a decree
  proclaiming the Far Eastern Republic an inseparable part of
  the R.S.F.S.R.

[18] The
  Csechoslovak Social-Democratic Party (Left) Congress held in
  Prague from May 14 to 16, 1921, was the Inaugural Congress
  of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. It was attended by
  569 delegates representing more than 350,000 Party
  members. The Congress adopted a resolution by acclamation on
  affiliation to the Third International. B. Smeral was the
  chief rapporteur at the Congress.

  Lenin made a thorough study of the material of the Congress
  (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, pp. 288, 289,
  311).

Vorwärts (Forward )—a newspaper
  published by the Austrian Left-wing Social-Democrats from
  May 1911 in Reichenberg. In 1921, it became the organ of the
  Czechoslovak Communist Party (German group).

[19] The verbatim
  report then goes on to say (Lenin spoke in German)
  “als Glied der Weltwirtschafw”; the
  French translation was “comme membre de
  l’économie mondiale”, and the English,
  “as a member of the world’s economy”. The
  text in this volume is taken from Pravda, July 9,
  1921, which did not contain these words.

## Speech to Comintern Executive Committee on French Question







 Speech to Comintern Executive Committee on French Question by V. I. Lenin 1921



V.I. Lenin 1921
Third Congress of the Communist International
Speech to Comintern Executive Committee on French Question[1]
June 17, 1921

I arrived at just the right moment, during the speech by BÃ©la Kun. I came here precisely in order to oppose the remarks by BÃ©la Kun. I suspected that if BÃ©la Kun opened his mouth, it could only be to defend the leftists, and so I wanted to find out on whose behalf he would speak. In Comrade BÃ©la Kun’s opinion, communism means defending the leftists. He is wrong, and this error must be most energetically opposed. 
It must be stated openly that if there are still opportunists in the French party (and I am convinced that this is true) if they are not Marxists (and that is quite accurate), the leftists, for their part, have also committed an error, in trying to appear as leftists in the mould of my friend Comrade BÃ©la Kun and some of the French comrades. Comrade BÃ©la Kun thinks that there are only opportunist errors, but leftist errors exist as well. 
According to the stenographic record of Comrade Trotsky’s remarks, he said that if the leftist comrades continue to act in this manner, they will be digging the grave of the Communist and workers’ movement in France. (Applause) I am strongly convinced of that as well. I have come here in order to protest the speech by Comrade BÃ©la Kun in which he attacked Comrade Trotsky instead of defending him, as he was obligated to do if he was a real Marxist.
Marxism consists of determining what policy should be adopted in different types of circumstances. However, when Comrade BÃ©la Kun comes here and talks of sangfroid and discipline, and of what was said about that in an article in L'HumanitÃ© with that title, it is he who understands nothing and is clearly in error. During a crisis such as that created by the mobilisation of French troops in the Ruhr, a party cannot launch slogans of that type. Anyone who does not understand that is not a Marxist.
Comrade BÃ©la Kun believes that being revolutionary is a matter of defending the leftists, everywhere and under all circumstances. Preparing the revolution in France, one of the largest countries in Europe, cannot be done by a party on its own. What gives me the greatest pleasure is the fact that the French Communists have won over the trade unions. When I pick up this or that French newspaper  –  and I must frankly admit that I do this only rarely, because I do not have time to read newspapers  –  I notice the word ‘cell’ (noyau). I don’t think you will find this word in any dictionary, because it is a purely Russian expression, which emerged from our long struggle against tsarism, against the Mensheviks, against opportunism and the bourgeois-democratic republic. It is our experience that gave rise to this organisational form. Cells act in concerted fashion, whether in the parliamentary fraction, in the trade unions, or in other organisations. And when Communists commit this or that error, even if less serious than the blunder committed by BÃ©la Kun, we do not give it our approval.
When I regard this outstanding work by the French party, these cells in the unions and other organisations, I must say that the victory of revolution in France is assured, provided that the leftists do not commit blunders. If people say, like Comrade BÃ©la Kun, that sangfroid and discipline cannot be justified, that is a leftist blunder. And I have come here to tell the leftist comrades that if you follow that advice, you will dig the grave of the revolutionary movement, just as Marat did.[2] I am not trying to defend the Communist Party of France. I do not claim that it is a thoroughly Communist Party. Not at all. Comrade Zalewski quotes a passage from L'HumanitÃ©, saying that the demand is justified; it may well be that he is quite right, from his point of view.[3] But we must not tolerate such a view. 
Let us take another example, that of Marcel Cachin and others who defended the foreign policy of the Franco-British alliance in the French legislature and said it was a guarantee of peace, when in fact this alliance is nothing more than a gang of robbers. That is opportunism, and a party that tolerates its parliamentary representative taking such a political position is not a Communist Party. We have certainly referred in our resolution to various facts that must be emphasised, and to various actions that cannot be tolerated and are not Communist. But criticism must be specific in character. The task is to condemn opportunism. But the pronounced opportunism expressed in Cachin’s speech has not been criticised. Instead, criticism has been directed at this formulation and new advice has been proposed. Comrade Trotsky said the following in his speech: (Lenin quotes a passage from the German stenographic transcript of Comrade Trotsky’s speech.)
In addition, Comrade Laporte is quite wrong and Comrade Trotsky absolutely right in protesting against this statement. I am prepared to concede that the conduct of the French party is perhaps not fully Communist. But in that given situation, a blunder of this type would destroy the Communist movement in France and Britain. The revolution cannot be carried out by the class of 1919. And Comrade Trotsky was a thousand times right to emphasise this repeatedly. The same holds true for the Luxembourg comrade [Reiland] who charged the French party with having failed to sabotage the occupation of Luxembourg. He thinks this is a geographical question, as does Comrade BÃ©la Kun. That’s way off the mark. It is a political question. And Comrade Trotsky was absolutely right to protest against this. Yes indeed, it is an entirely leftist blunder, in which you appear to be very revolutionary, but which is in fact very harmful for the French movement. 
The only thing that can prevent the victory of communism in France, Britain, and Germany is leftist blunders of this sort. If we pursue our campaign against opportunism without exaggeration, our victory is certain. We should openly criticise the French party. We should say that they are not a Communist Party. We should say bluntly that the policy advanced by Marcel Cachin regarding the alliance of France and Britain to exploit the working masses  –  and here, if I may use a word in an unofficial sense, they are robbers, and not only that, but robbers on a huge scale  –  we should state emphatically and entirely openly that the policy advanced by Cachin in this or that speech, in this or that article is not Communist but opportunist. The Central Committee of the Communist Party and, I hope, the Communist International congress as well will not approve this policy. Nonetheless we will not tolerate the even greater blunders committed by Comrade BÃ©la Kun, or the blunders in the speech by the comrade from Luxembourg, or those of Comrade Laporte  –  even though he speaks so eloquently. I know that there are true revolutionaries among the Communist youth. Criticise the opportunists in a specific fashion; demonstrate the errors of official French communism  –  but do not commit such blunders! 
Now, as the masses are approaching you more and more closely and as you are advancing toward victory, you must win over the trade unions. Preparations are under way in outstanding fashion to win a majority in the unions. And when you win them over, it will be an enormous victory. The bourgeois bureaucracy is powerless. It is the bureaucratic leaders of the Two-and-a-Half International that have the upper hand in the unions. Our task is to win a firm Marxist majority and then we will begin to make the revolution. But not with the class of 1919 and similar blunders, in which BÃ©la Kun excels, but through the struggle against opportunism, and against the leftist blunders now coming to light. 
Perhaps, in that case, there will be no need for a struggle, but only a warning against Marcel Cachin’s speech. An open struggle against traditions and opportunism, but only a warning against leftist blunders. That is why I have considered it my duty to support Comrade Trotsky’s position, by and large. The position advanced by Comrade BÃ©la Kun is not worthy to be expressed by any Marxist, by any Communist comrade. It must be actively opposed. And I hope, comrades, that after the commission proposed here has done its work (and setting it up is a sensible move), and after an investigation of the French party’s conduct, it will come to a conclusion that does justice to this idea.[4]

Notes
1. From RGASPI, 495/1/37-8. 
Victor Serge is probably referring to this speech when he recalls:
Lenin spoke in French, briskly and harshly. Ten or more times, he used the phrase ‘BÃ©la Kun’s stupid mistakes’: little words that turned his listeners to stone. My wife took down the speech in shorthand, and afterwards we had to edit it somewhat: after all it was out of the question for the symbolic figure of the Hungarian Revolution to be called an imbecile ten times over in a written record.  In Memoirs of a Revolutionary (New York Review Books [1951], 2012), p. 163)
Serge presents Lenin’s speech as taking place during an ECCI debate on Germany. However, Lenin’s comments at such a debate would have been delivered in German, not French, and the stenographic transcript would not likely have been compiled by Serge’s wife (Liuba Russakova Kibalchich).
2. The comment on Marat attributed here to Lenin is at odds with other writings of his that express respect for Jacobin revolutionaries of 1793. Marxists of his time generally evaluated Marat positively. The name index of Lenin’s Collected Works (Lenin 1960 – 71) includes no mention of Marat. The present translation is based on an uncorrected archival record that is not free from anomalies; the reference to Marat may represent a slip by either Lenin or the stenographer. Lenin may have been thinking of Maximilien Robespierre, whom many Marxists outside France held responsible for having begun the repression of the popular movement. Thanks to Jean-Numa Ducange for research assistance on this point. 
3. The ‘demand’ referred to here and subsequently is the French Communist youth’s slogan that youth drafted for military duty refuse to report for service, explained earlier in this discussion by Laporte. 
4. In a 29 June 1921 letter to the Italian CP leadership, Umberto Terracini described the impact of this speech: ‘I will not conceal the impression created among all congress participants during the commission and Executive discussions,... namely, that these comrades have leaned enormously to the right. Lenin gave a speech on the French party ... [i]n which he laid out tactical principles, but did so using terms that were so crude and expressing himself so curtly that it was quite clear ... he was trying to prepare the delegates for even coarser statements in his speech to the congress. The content of his speech was markedly toward the right, as against what he explicitly terms ‘les bÃªtises de gauche’ [leftist stupidities]. Nor did he find more genial terms to describe the factions at the extreme [left] in all the International’s parties.’

      The principal mistake we have all been making up to now is too
      much optimism; as a result, we succumbed to bureaucratic
      utopias. Only a very small part of our plans has been
      realised. Life, everyone, in fact, has laughed at our plans.

      This must be radically altered.

      Anticipate the worst. We already have some experience; it is
      slight, but practical.

      Food supplies? Frumkin says: The. ideal is 150 million
      poods from the tax + 50 million poods by means
      of exchange +40 million poods from the Ukraine = 240
      million poods.

      We must base our calculations on a total of 200 million
      poods for the year.

      What are we to do with this paltry, starvation figure? 200:
      12=16 2/3.

      (α) Take a minimum for the army, i.e., calculate the
      rations for a minimum army.

      (β) Include in the plan the economic work of the army on a
      modest, extremely modest scale.

      1 subbotnik,[Voluntary work on
      weekends without pay.—Translator.] 60 per
      cent of the army (participating).

      1 out of 3 subbotnitcs 50 per cent participants (50 per cent of
      the army), etc.

      (γ) For office employees-drastic reduction.

      (δ) The workers.

      Immediately draw up a list of the best enterprises (stress
      enterprises) by industries.

      Close down ½  to ¼ of those now running.

      The rest to run in two shifts. Only those which have enough
      fuel and bread, even if the minimum quantity
      of grain is collected (200 million poods) and fuel (?)
      for the whole year.

      Do this in rough outline, as a first approximation,
      immediately, in a month, no later.

      Fuel, we have.

      A People’s Commissariat for Communications, we have.

      There is no need to be exact about food; take 200 million
      poods.

      Industry according to branches and gubernias
      (don’t put it off until we get the figures for the
      “whole”), get this done with the utmost speed, 

    

      and,
      the main thing, 

    

      put 70 per cent of the members of the State
      Planning Commission to work 14 hours a day (let science sweat a
      bit; we have given them good rations, now we must make them
      work).

      Each one to be given the task of keeping “general
      supervision” (I think that is what it is called in the
      regulations of the State Planning Commission) over definite
      enterprises.

      Take 700 as the number of large establishments, enterprises,
      depots (railway), state farms, etc., etc., that we must (and
      can, even at the worst: 200 million poods of grain in
      the course of the year) start and keep running from October 1,
      1921 to October 1, 1922.

      700 35 members of the State Planning Commission == 20.

      Say 30 (not all the members of the State Planning Conmission
      will be continuously engaged on current work).

      Take the trouble to supervise these 30 unremittingly.
      You are responsible for this.

      Over and above these, keep an eye on another 30-70, less
      important; don’t keep them under constant observation, but
      make inquiries in passing, from time to time.

      To supervise unremittingly means answering with your head for
      the rational consumption of fuel and grain, for the maximum
      stocking of the one and the other, for the maximum deliveries,
      for economising fuel (in industry, on the railways, etc.), for
      economising food (feed only good workers), for increasing
      productivity of labour, etc.

      All the rest-lease or give to anybody you please, or close, or
      “abandon”, forget about, until a sound improvement
      is achieved, which will enable us to operate confidently, not
      with 200 million poods of grain +X million
      poods of fuel, but with 300 million poods of
      grain +150 per cent of X fuel.

      These are my ideas about the State Planning Commission.

      Think it over. Let’s discuss it.

## Greetings to the Delegates of
    Congress of Tsentrosoyuz

Greetings To
The Delegate Congress Of Tsentrosoyuz[1]

I send my greetings to the assembly of Tsentrosoyuz delegates on behalf of the Council of People's Commissars and of the Central Committee of the R.C.P. I deeply regret that I cannot be present to express my views on the most complicated problems confronting the co-operative societies.
I have no doubt that time pooling of experience of the work already done will help you to solve these problems in harmony with the plan for the country's overall economic development. Success in the practical work that now lies ahead will depend largely on the establishment, through the medium of commodity exchange, of proper relations between urban industry and agriculture. It will depend on the ability of the co-operative societies, by steady and persistent effort, to clear the way for the development of commodity exchange and to take the lead in this field. It will depend on their ability to collect the scattered stocks of commodities and to secure the production of new ones. In the long run, the practical solution of these problems is the best way to achieve our aims, namely, to restore agriculture and, on that basis, to strengthen and develop large-scale industry.
These problems have been complicated very much by the crop failure, which has become apparent in a number of gubernias. In your work, you will have to devote special attention to this fresh disaster and keep its consequences in mind when tackling all current questions.
I am sure that, short as the experience of work under the new conditions may be, Soviet co-operative societies will succeed in closely linking up their work with the general task of overcoming the chaos in the country's economy, and will display the utmost energy in this fight.

[1] The Congress, or the Third All-Russia Assembly of Tsentrosoyuz Delegates, was held in Moscow from July 16 to 23, 1921, and was attended by 384 delegates (250 with voice and vote, and 134 with voice only) from many parts of Russia. It discussed reports and adopted decisions on the activity of Tsentrosoyuz; prospects of the consumers’ cooperative societies; trade and commodity exchange of Tsentrosoyuz; workers’ co-operative societies; the state of and prospects for foreign trade and the role of co-operatives; co-operative societies’ assistance to areas hit by the crop failure, and other questions. Lenin was elected Honorary Chairman, and his message of greetings was read at the first plenary sitting on July 16.

      July 18

      Comrade Rykov,

      Please be so kind as to convey to the delegates of the
      International Congress of Trade Unions the following:

      I thank them from the bottom of my heart for the invitation to
      the Congress sent through you. I deeply regret that I am unable
      to accept it because of ill-health, for on doctor’s orders
      I have had to leave Moscow for a month’s holiday.

      Please convey to the delegates my greetings and heartfelt wishes
      for the success o the Congress. It is hard to find words to
      express the full irnpoytance of the International Congress of
      Trade Unions. The winning of trade unionists to the ideas of
      communism is making irresistible headway everywhere, in all
      countries, throughout the world. The process is sporadic,
      overcoming a thousand obstccles, but it is making irresistible
      progress. The International Congress of Trade Unions will
      quicken this movement. Communism will triumph in the trade
      unions. No power on earth can avert the collapse of capitalism
      and the victory of the working class over the bourgeoisie.

      Warm greetings and confidence in the inevitable victory of
      communism.
N. Lenin

[1] The Congress took
      place in Moscow from July 3 to 19, 1921, and was attended by 380
      delegates from 41 countries of Europe, America and Asia, among
      them Russia, Britain, Italy, Spain, France, Bulgaria,
      Yugoslavia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, Finland,
      Korea, China and South Africa. The items on the agenda were: 1)
      Report of the Provisional International Council of Trade Unions,
      which was set up in July ’1920; 2) The world economic
      crisis and trade union tasks and tactics; 3) Trade unions and
      parties. The Red International of Trade Unions and the Communist
      International; 4) Trade unions, factory committees and shop
      stewards; 5) Trade unions and workers’ control over
      production; 6) Unemployment; 7) International trade and
      industrial unions; 8) Organisational question; 9) Women in
      production and trade unions.

      It was the Inaugural Congress of the Red Trade Union
      International, which existed till late 1937 and had a great
      influence on the world trade union movement.

      The Congress adopted the Rules of the Red Trade Union
      International, and elected its Central Council. It also adopted
      resolutions on other questions.

      The Trade Union International fought for unity in the trade
      union movement on the basis of the revolutionary struggle for
      working-class demands; against the offensive of capital and
      fascism, and the danger of an imperialist war. It worked for
      unity with the working class of Soviet Russia.

      Lenin’s message of greetings, sent in reply to an
      invitation from several delegations to attend, was read at the
      seventeenth sitting on July 19.

Appeal To The International Proletariat

First Published: Pravda No. 172, August 6, 1921; Published according to the Pravda text collated with the manuscript

      Several gubernias in Russia have been hit by a famine whose
      proportions are apparently only slightly less than those of the
      1891 calamity.

      It is the painful aftermath of Russia’s backwardness and
      of seven years of war, first, the imperialist, and then, the
      Civil War, which was forced upon the workers and peasants by the
      landowners and capitalists of all countries.

      We need help. The Soviet Republic of workers and peasants
      expects this help from the working people, the industrial
      workers and the small farmers.

      The mass of both the former and the latter are themselves
      oppressed by capitalism and imperialism everywhere, but we are
      convinced that they will respond to our appeal, despite their
      own hard condition caused by unemployment and the rising cost of
      living.

      Those who have suffered from capitalist oppression all their
      lives will understand the position of the workers and peasants
      of Russia, they will grasp or, guided by the instinct of working
      and exploited people, will sense the need of helping the Soviet
      Republic, whose lot it was to be the first to undertake the hard
      but gratifying task of overthrowing capitalism. That is why the
      capitalists of all countries are revenging themselves upon the
      Soviet Republic; that is why they are planning a fresh campaign,
      intervention, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies against
      it.

      All the greater, we trust, will be the vigour and the
      self-sacrifice with which the workers and the small labouring
      farmers of all countries will help us.

      called on the workers to contribute a day’s earnings for
      the famine stricken population of Russia. Henri Barbusse and
      Anatole France played an active part in organising assistance,
      and the latter contributed to the fund the Nobel Prize he was
      awarded in 1921. About one million francs were collected in
      France. Czechoslovakia contributed 7,5 million korunas in cash
      and 2 million korunas’ worth of food; the German Communist
      Part collected 1.3 million marks in cash and I million
      marks’ worth of food; Dutch Communists collected 100,000
      guilders; the Italians, about 1 million liras; the Norwegians,
      100,000 krones; the Austrians, 3 million krones; the Spaniards,
      50,000 marks; the Poles, 9 million marks; the Danes, 500,000
      marks, etc. By December 20, 1921, Communist organisations had
      bought 312,000 poods of food and collected 1 million gold
      rubles. The organisations of the Amsterdam International bought
      85,625 poods of food and collected 485,000 gold rubles.

      This year, the Ukraine, west of the Dnieper, has. had an
      excellent harvest. The workers and peasants in the
      famine-stricken Volga area, who are now suffering hardships only
      a little less severe than the dreadful calamity of 1891, look to
      the Ukrainian farmers for help. Help must come quickly. Help
      must be abundant. o farmer must refrain from sharing his surplus
      with the starving Volga peasants who have no seed with which to
      sow their fields.

      Let every uyezd that is well supplied with grain send, say, two
      or three peasant delegates to the Volga to deliver the grain,
      and to see for themselves the terrible suffering, want and
      starvation, and tell their fellow-countrymen upon their return
      how urgently help is needed.

A Letter To G. Myasnikov[1]

Written: 5 August, 1921

Source: Lenin’s Collected Works, 1st English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 32, pages 504-509

August 5, 1921

      Comrade Myasnikov,

      I have only just managed to read both your articles. I am
      unaware of the nature of the speeches you made in the Perm (I
      think it was Perm) organisation and of your conflict with it. I
      can say nothing about that; it will be dealt with by the
      Organisation Bureau, which, I hear, has appointed a special
      commission.

      My object is a different one: it is to appraise your articles as
      literary and political documents.

      They are interesting documents.

      Your main mistake is, I think, most clearly revealed in the
      article “Vexed Questions”. And I consider it my duty
      to do all I can to try to convince you.

      At the beginning of the article you make a correct application
      of dialectics. Indeed, whoever fails to understand the
      substitution of the slogan of “civil peace” for the
      slogan of “civil war” lays himself open to ridicule,
      if nothing worse. In this, you are right.

      But precisely because you are right on this point, I am
      surprised that in drawing your conclusions, you should have
      forgotten the dialectics which you yourself had properly
      applied.

      ”Freedom of the press, from the monarchists to the
      anarchists, inclusively” . . . . Very good! But just a
      minute: every Marxist and every worker who ponders over the four
      years’ experience of our revolution will say,
      “Let’s look into this-what sort of freedom of the
      press? What for? For which class?”

      We do not believe in “absolutes”. We laugh at
      “pure democracy “.

      The “freedom of the press” slogan became a great
      world slogan at the close of the Middle Ages and remained so up
      to the nineteenth century. Why? Because it expressed the ideas
      of the progressive bourgeoisie, i.e., its struggle against kings
      and priests, feudal lords and landowners.

      No country in the world has done as much to liberate the masses
      from the influence of priests and landowners as the
      R.S.F.S.R. has done, and is doing. We have been performing this
      function of “freedom of the press” better than
      anyone else in the world. 

    

      All over the world, wherever there are
      capitalists, freedom of the press means freedom to buy up
      newspapers, to buy writers, to bribe, buy and fake “public
      opinion” for the benefit of the bourgeoisie. 

    

      This is a
      fact. 

    

      No one will ever be able to refute it. 

    

      And what about us?

    

      Can anyone deny that the bourgeoisie in this country has been
      defeated, but not destroyed? That it has gone into hiding?
      Nobody can deny it.

      Freedom of the press in the R.S.F.S.R., which is surrounded by
      the bourgeois enemies of the whole world, means freedom of
      political organisation for the bourgeoisie and its most loyal
      servants, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.

      This is an irrefutable fact.

      The bourgeoisie (all over the world) is still very much stronger
      than we are. To place in its hands yet another weapon like
      freedom of political organisation (= freedom of the press, for
      the press is the core and foundation of political organisation)
      means facilitating the enemy’s task, means helping the
      class enemy.

      We have no wish to commit suicide, and therefore, we will not do
      this.

      We clearly see this fact: “freedom of the press”
      means in practice that the international bourgeoisie will
      immediately buy up hundreds and thousands of Cadet,
      SocialistRevolutionary and Menshevik writers, and will organise
      their propaganda and fight against us.

      That is a fact. “They” are richer than we are and
      will buy a “force” ten times larger than we have, to
      fight us.

      No, we will not do it; we will not help the international
      bourgeoisie.

      How could you descend from a class appraisal-from the appraisal
      of the relations between all classes-to the sentimental,
      philistine appraisal? This is a mystery to me.

      On the question: “civil peace or civil war”, on the
      question of how we have won over, and will continue to
      “win over”, the peasantry (to the side of the
      proletariat), on these two key world questions (= questions that
      affect the very substance of world politics), on these questions
      (which are dealt with in both your articles), you were able to
      take the Marxist standpoint, instead of the philistine,
      sentimental standpoint. You did take account of the
      relationships of all classes in a practical, sober way.

      And suddenly you slide down into the abyss of
      sentimentalism!

      ”Outrage and abuses are rife in this country: freedom of
      the press will expose them.”

      That, as far as I can judge from your two articles, is where you
      slipped up. You have allowed yourself to be depressed by certain
      sad and deplorable /acts, and lost the ability soberly to
      appraise the forces.

      Freedom of the press will help the force of the world
      bourgeoisie. That is a fact, “Freedom of the press”
      will not help to purge the Communist Party in Russia of a number
      of its weaknesses, mistakes, misfortunes and maladies (it cannot
      be denied that there is a spate of these maladies), because this
      is not what the world bourgeoisie wants. But freedom of the
      press will he a weapon in the hands of this world
      bourgeoisie. It is not dead; it is alive. It is lurking nearby
      and watching. It has already hired Milyukov, to whom Chernov and
      Martov (partly because of their stupidity, and partly because of
      factional spleen against us; but mainly because of the objective
      logic of their pettybourgeois-democratic position) are giving
      “faithful and loyal” service.

      You took the wrong fork in the road.

      You wanted to cure the Communist Party of its maladies and have
      snatched at a drug that will cause certain deathnot at your
      hands, of course, but at the hands of the world bourgeoisie
      (+Milyukov+Chernov-J--Martov).

      You forgot a minor point, a very tiny point, namely: the world
      bourgeoisie and its “freedom” to buy up for itself
      newspapers, and centres of political organisation.

      No, we will not take this course. Nine hundred out of every
      thousand politically conscious workers will refuse to take this
      course.

      We have many maladies. Mistakes (our common mistakes, all of us
      have made mistakes, the Council of Labour and Defence, the
      Council of People’s Commissars and the Central Committee)
      like those we made in distributing fuel and food in the autumn
      and winter of 1920 (those were enormous mistakes!) have greatly
      aggravated the maladies springing from our situation.

      Want and calamity abound.

      They have been terribly intensified by the famine of 1921.

      It will cost us a supreme effort to extricate ourselves, but we
      will get out, and have already begun to do so.

      We will extricate oirselves, for, in the main, our policy is a
      correct one, and takes into account all the class forces on an
      international scale. We will extricate ourselves because we do
      not try to make our position look better than it is. We realise
      all the difficulties. We see all the maladies, and are taking
      measures to cure them methodically, with perseverance, and
      without giving way to panic.

      You have allowed panic to get the better of you; panic is a
      slope-once you stepped on it you slid down into a position that
      looks very much as if you are forming a new party, or are about
      to commit suicide.

      You must not give way to panic.

      Is there any isolation of the Communist Party cells from the
      Party? There is. It is an evil, a misfortune, a malaise.

      It is there. It is a severe ailment.

      We can see it.

      It must be cured by proletarian and Party measures and not by
      means of “freedom” (for the bourgeoisie).

      Much of what you say about reviving the country’s economy,
      about mechanical ploughs, etc., about fighting for
      “influence” over the peasantry, etc., is true and
      useful.

      Why not bring this out separately? We shall get together and
      work harmoniously in one party. The benefits will be great; they
      will not come all at once, but very slowly.

      Revive the Soviets; secure the co-operation of non-Party people;
      let non-Party people verify the work of Party members: this is
      absolutely right. No end of work there, and it has hardly been
      started.

      Why not amplify this in a practical way? In a pamphlet for the
      Congress?

      Why not take that up?

      Why be afraid of spade work (denounce abuses through the Central
      Control Commission, or the Party press, Pravda)?

      Misgivings about slow, difficult and arduous spade work cause
      people to give way to panic and to seek an “easy”
      way out: “freedom of the press” (for the
      bourgeoisie).

      Why should you persist in your mistake-an obvious mistake-in
      your non-Party, anti-proletarian slogan of “freedom of the
      press”? Why not take up the less “brilliant”
      (scintillating with bourgeois brilliance) spade work of driving
      out abuses, combating them, and helping non-Party people in a
      practical and business-like way?

      Have you ever brought up any particular abuse to the notice of
      the C.C., and suggested a definite means of eradicating it?

      No, you have not.

      Not a single time.

      You saw a spate of misfortunes and maladies, gave way to despair
      and rushed into the arms of the enemy, the bourgeoisie
      (”freedom of the press” for the bourgeoisie). My
      advice is: do not give way to despair and panic.

      We, and those who sympathise with us, the workers and peasants,
      still have an immense reservoir of strength. We still have
      plenty of health and vigour.

      We are not doing enough to cure our ailments.

      We are not doing a good job of practising the slogan: promote
      non-Party people, let non-Party people verify the work of Party
      members.

      But we can, and will, do a hundred times more in this field than
      we are doing.

      I hope that after thinking this over carefully you will not, out
      of false pride, persist in an obvious political mistake
      (”freedom of the press”), but, pulling yourself
      together and overcoming the panic, will get down to practical
      work: help to establish ties with non-Party people, and help
      non-Party people to verify the work of Party members.

      There is no end o work in this field. Doing this work you can
      (and should) help to cure the disease, slowly but surely,
      instead of chasing after will-o’-the-wisps like
      “freedom of the press”.
With communist greetings,

    

      Lenin

      Dear comrade,

      I thank you very much for your letter, of August 7. I have read
      nothing concerning the English movement last months because of
      my illness and overwork.

      It is extremely interesting what you communicate. Perhaps it is
      the beginning of the real proletarian mass movement in
      Great Britain in the communist sense. I am afraid we
      have till now in England few very feeble propagandist societies
      for communism (inclusive the British Communist Party[1]) but
      no really mass communist movement.

      If the South Wales Miners’ Federation has decided on July
      24 to affiliate to the Third International by a majority of 120
      to 63-perhaps it is the beginning of a new era. (How many miners
      there are in England? More than 500,000? How much in South
      Wales? 25,000? How many miners were really represented in
      Cardiff July 24, 1921?)

      If these miners are not too small minority, if they fraternise
      with soldiers and begin a real “class
      war”—we must do all our possible to develop
      this movement and strengthen it.

      Economic measures (like communal kitchens) are good but they are
      not much important now, before the victory of the
      proletarian revolution in England. Now the political struggle is
      the most important.

      English capitalists are shrewd, clever, astute. They will
      support (directly or indirectly) communal kitchens in
      order to divert the attention from political
      aims.

      What is important is (if I am not mistaken):

      1) To create a very good, really proletarian, really mass
         Communist Party in this part of England, that is,
         such party which will really be the leading
         force in all labour movement in this part of the
         country. (Apply the resolution on organisation and work of
         the Party adopted by the Third Congress to this part of your
         country.)

      2) To start a daily paper of the working class, for the working
         class in this part of the country.

      To start it not as a business (as usually newspapers are started
      in capitalist countries), not with big sum of money, not in
      ordinary and usual manner—but as an economic and
      political tool of the masses in their struggle.

      Either the miners of this district are capable to pay
      halfpenny daily (for the beginning weekly, if
      you like) for their own daily (or weekly) newspaper (be it very
      small, it is not important)—or there is no
      beginning of really communist mass movement in this
      part of your country.

      If the Communist Party of this district cannot collect a few
      pounds in order to publish small leaflets daily as a beginning
      of the really proletarian communist newspaper if it is so, if
      every miner will not pay a penny for it, then there is
      not serious, not genuine affiliation to the Third
      International.

      English Government will apply the shrewdest means in order to
      suppress every beginning of this kind. Therefore we must be (in
      the beginning) very prudent. The paper must be not too
      revolutionary in the beginning. If you will have three
      editors, at least one must be non-communist. (At least two
      genuine workers.) If nine-tenths of the workers do not buy this
      paper, if two-thirds  120/120 + 63  do not pay special
      contributions (1. 1. penny weekly) for their
      paper it will be no workers’ newspaper.

      I should be very glad to have few lines from you concerning this
      theme and beg to apologise for my bad English.

      With communist greetings,

    

      Lenin

      Party of Britain was founded at the Inaugural Congress held from
      July 31 to August 1, 1920. It united the Left wing of the
      British Socialist Party, the majority of the Scottish Socialist
      Workers’ Party, the Irish Socialists, the Communist Unity
      Group of the Socialist Labour Party, the South Wales Communist
      Council and a number of small socialist groups. In January 1921,

      Workers’ Party (consisting mostly of members of the shop
      stewards movement in Scotland, headed by William Gallacher) and
      the Workers’ Socialist Federation. The formation of the
      British Communist Party was completed when the Left wing of the
      Independent Workers’ Party, headed by Palme Dutt, joined
      it in the spring of 1921.

## A Letter

V. I. Lenin 
A Letter to the German Communists

Written: 14 August, 1921

      Dear comrades,

      I had intended to state my view of the lessons of the Third
      Congress of the Communist International in a detailed
      article. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to start on
      this work because of ill-health. The fact that a Congress of
      your Party, the United Communist Party of Germany (V.K.P.D.),[1] has been called for August 22,
      compels me to hasten with this letter, which I have to finish
      within a few hours, if I am not to be late in sending it to
      Germany.

      So far as I can judge, the position of the Communist Party in
      Germany is a particularly difficult one. This is
      understandable.

      Firstly, and mainly, from the end of 1918, the international
      position of Germany very quickly and sharply aggravated her
      internal revolutionary crisis and impelled the vanguard of the
      proletariat towards an immediate seizure of power. At the same
      time, the German and the entire international bourgeoisie,
      excellently armed and organised, and taught by the
      “Russian experience”, hurled itself upon the
      revolutionary proletariat of Germany in a frenzy of hate. Tens
      of thousands of the best people of Germany—her
      revolutionary workers—were killed or tortured to death by
      the bourgeoisie, its heroes, Noske and Co., its servants, the
      Scheidemanns, etc., and by its indirect and
      “subtle”(and therefore particularly valuable)
      accomplices, the knights of the “Two-and-a-Half
      International”, with their despicable spinelessness,
      vacillations, pedantry and philistinism. The armed capitalists
      set traps for the unarmed workers; they killed them wholesale,
      murdered their leaders, ambushing them one by one, and making
      excellent use to this end of the counter-revolutionary howling
      of both shades of Social-Democrats, the Scheidemannites and the
      Kautskyites. When the crisis broke out, however, the German
      workers lacked a genuine revolutionary party, owing to the fact
      that the split was brought about too late, and owing to the
      burden of the accursed tradition of “unity”with
      capital’s corrupt (the Scheidemanns, Legiens, Davids and
      Co.) and spineless (the Kautskys, Hilferdings and Co.) gang of
      lackeys. The heart of every honest and class-conscious worker
      who accepted the Basle Manifesto of 1912[2] at its
      face value and not as a “gesture”on the part of the
      scoundrels of the “Second” and the
      “Two-and-a-Half “ grades, was filled with incredibly
      bitter hatred for the opportunism of the old German
      Social-Democrats, and this hatred—the greatest and most
      noble sentiment of the best people among the oppressed and
      exploited masses—blinded people and prevented them from
      keeping their heads and working out a correct strategy with
      which to reply to the excellent strategy of the Entente
      capitalists, who were armed, organised and schooled by the
      “Russian experience”, and supported by France,
      Britain and America. This hatred pushed them into premature
      insurrections.

      That is why the development of the revolutionary working-class
      movement in Germany has since the end of 1918 been treading a
      particularly hard and painful road. But it has marched and is
      marching steadily forward. There is the incontrovertible fact of
      the gradual swing to the left among the masses of workers, the
      real majority of the labouring and exploited people in Germany,
      both those organised in the old, Menshevik trade unions (i.e.,
      the unions serving the bourgeoisie) and those entirely, or
      almost entirely, unorganised. What the German proletariat must
      and will do—and this is the guarantee of victory—is
      keep their heads; systematically rectify the mistakes of the
      past; steadily win over the mass of the workers both inside and
      outside the trade unions; patiently build up a strong and
      intelligent Communist Party capable of giving real leadership to
      the masses at every turn of events; and work out a strategy that
      is on a level with the best international strategy of the most
      advanced bourgeoisie, which is “enlightened”by
      agelong experience in general, and the “Russian
      experience”in particular.   

    

      On the other hand, the
      difficult position of the Communist Party of Germany is
      aggravated at the present moment by the break-away of the not
      very good Communists on the left (the Communist Workers’
      Party of Germany, K.A.P.D.) and on the right (Paul Levi and his
      little magazine Unser Weg or Sowjet [3]).

      Beginning with the Second Congress of the Communist
      International, the Leftists”or
      “K.A.P.-ists”have received sufficient warning from
      us in the international arena. Until sufficiently strong,
      experienced and influential Communist Parties have been built,
      at least in the principal countries, the participation of
      semi-anarchist elements in our international congresses has to
      be tolerated, and is to some extent even useful. It is useful
      insofar as these elements serve as a clear
      “warning”to inexperienced Communists, and also
      insofar as they themselves are still capable of learning. All
      over the world, anarchism has been splitting up—not since
      yesterday, but since the beginning of the imperialist war of
      1914-18—into two trends: one pro-Soviet, and the other
      anti-Soviet; one in favour of the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, and the other against it. We must allow this
      process of disintegration among the anarchists to go on and come
      to a head. Hardly anyone in Western Europe has experienced
      anything like a big revolution. There, the experience of great
      revolutions has been almost entirely forgotten, and the
      transition from the desire to be revolutionary and from talk
      (and resolutions) about revolution to real revolutionary work is
      very difficult, painful and slow.

      It goes without saying, however, that the semi-anarchist
      elements can and should be tolerated only within certain
      limits. In Germany, we tolerated them for quite a long time. The
      Third Congress of the Communist International faced them with an
      ultimatum and fixed a definite time limit. If they have now
      voluntarily resigned from the Communist International, all the
      better. Firstly, they have saved us the trouble of expelling
      them. Secondly, it has now been demonstrated most conclusively
      and most graphically, and proved with precise facts to all
      vacillating workers, and all those who have been inclined
      towards anarchism because of their hatred for the opportunism of
      the old Social-Democrats, that the Communist International has
      been patient, that it has not expelled anarchists immediately
      and unconditionally, and that it has given them an attentive
      hearing and helped them to learn.

      We must now pay less attention to the K.A.P.-ists. By polemising
      with them we merely give them publicity. They are too
      unintelligent; it is wrong to take them seriously; and it is not
      worth being angry with them. They have no influence among the
      masses, and will acquire none, unless we make mistakes. Let us
      leave this tiny trend to die a natural death; the workers
      themselves will realise that it is worthless. Let us propagate
      and implement, with greater effect, the organisational and
      tactical decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist
      International, instead of giving the K.A.P.-ists publicity by
      arguing with them. The infantile disorder of
      “Leftism”is passing and will pass away as the
      movement grows.

      Similarly we are now needlessly helping Paul Levi, we are
      needlessly giving him publicity by polemising with him. That we
      should argue with him is exactly what he wants. Now, after the
      decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist International,
      we must forget about him and devote all our attention, all our
      efforts, to peaceful, practical and constructive work (without
      any squabbling, polemics, or bringing up of the quarrels of
      yesterday), in the spirit of the decisions of the Third
      Congress. It is my conviction that Comrade K. Radek’s
      article, “The Third World Congress on the March Action,
      and Future Tactics”(in Die Rote Fahne,[4] the Central Organ of the United
      Communist Party of Germany, issues of July 14 and 15, 1921),
      sins quite considerably against this general and unanimously
      adopted decision of the Third Congress. This article, a copy of
      which was sent me by one of the Polish Communists, is quite
      unnecessarily—and in a way that positively harms our
      work—directed not only against Paul Levi (that would be
      very unimportant), but also against Clara Zetkin. And yet Clara
      Zetkin herself concluded a “peace treaty”in Moscow,
      during the Third Congress, with the C.C. (the
      “Centrale”) of the United Communist Party of
      Germany, providing  for joint, non-factional work! And we all
      approved of the treaty. In his misplaced polemical zeal, Comrade
      K. Radek has gone to the length of saying something positively
      untrue, attributing to Zetkin the idea of “putting
      off”(verlegt ) “every general action by the
      Party”(jede allgemeine Aktion der Partei )
      “until the day when large masses rise”(auf den
      Tag, wo die grossen Massen aufstehen werden ). It goes
      without saying that by such methods Comrade K. Radek is
      rendering Paul Levi the best service the latter could wish
      for. There is nothing Paul Levi wants so much as a controversy
      endlessly dragged out, with as many people involved in it as
      possible, and efforts to drive Zetkin away from the party by
      polemical breaches of the “peace treaty”which she
      herself concluded, and which was approved by the entire
      Communist International. Comrade K. Radek’s article serves
      as an excellent example of how Paul Levi is assisted from the
      “Left”.

      Here I must explain to the German comrades why I defended Paul
      Levi so long at the Third Congress. Firstly, because I made
      Levi’s acquaintance through Radek in Switzerland in 1915
      or 1916. At that time Levi was already a Bolshevik. I cannot
      help entertaining a certain amount of distrust towards those who
      accepted Bolshevism only after its victory in Russia,
      and after it had scored a number of victories in the
      international arena. But, of course, this reason is relatively
      unimportant, for, after all, my personal knowledge of Paul Levi
      is very small. Incomparably more important was the second
      reason, namely, that essentially much of Levi’s
      criticism of the March action in Germany in 1921 was
      correct (not, of course, when he said that the uprising
      was a “putsch"; that assertion of his was absurd).

      It is true that Levi did all he possibly could, and much
      besides, to weaken and spoil his criticism, and make it
      difficult for himself and others to understand the
      essence of the matter, by bringing in a mass of details
      in which he was obviously wrong. Levi couched his criticism in
      an impermissible and harmful form. While urging others to pursue
      a cautious and well-considered strategy, Levi himself committed
      worse blunders than a schoolboy, by rushing into battle so
      prematurely, so unprepared, so absurdly  and wildly that he was
      certain to lose any “battle”(spoiling or hampering
      his work for many years), although the “battle”could
      and should have been won. Levi behaved like an “anarchist
      intellectual”(if I am not mistaken, the German term is
      Edelanarchist ), instead of behaving like an organised
      member of the proletarian Communist International. Levi
      committed a breach of discipline.

      By this series of incredibly stupid blunders Levi made it
      difficult to concentrate attention on the essence of the
      matter. And the essence of the matter, i.e., the appraisal
      and correction of the innumerable mistakes made by the
      United Communist Party of Germany during the March action of
      1921, has been and continues to be of enormous importance. In
      order to explain and correct these mistakes (which some people
      enshrined as gems of Marxist tactics) it was necessary
      to have been on the Right wing during the Third
      Congress of the Communist International. Otherwise the
      line of the Communist International would have been a
      wrong one.

      I defended and had to defend Levi, insofar as I saw before me
      opponents of his who merely shouted about
      “Menshevism”and “Centrism”and refused to
      see the mistakes of the March action and the need to explain and
      correct them. These people made a caricature of revolutionary
      Marxism, and a pastime of the struggle against
      “Centrism”. They might have done the greatest harm
      to the whole cause, for “no one in the world can
      compromise the revolutionary Marxists, if they do not compromise
      themselves”.

      I said to these people: Granted that Levi has become a
      Menshevik. As I have scant knowledge of him personally, I will
      not insist, if the point is proved to me. But it has not yet
      been proved. All that has been proved till now is that he
      has lost his head. It is childishly stupid to declare a
      man a Menshevik merely on these grounds. The training of
      experienced and influential party leaders is a long and
      difficult job. And without it the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, and its “unity of will”, remain a
      phrase. In Russia, it took us fifteen years (1903-17) to produce
      a group of leaders—fifteen years of fighting Menshevism,
      fifteen years of tsarist persecution, fifteen years, which
      included the years of the first revolution (1905), a great and
      mighty revolution.  Yet we have had our sad cases, when even
      fine comrades have “lost their heads”. If the
      West-European comrades imagine that they are insured against
      such “sad cases”it is sheer childishness, and we
      cannot but combat it.

      Levi had to be expelled for breach of discipline. Tactics had to
      be determined on the basis of a most detailed
      explanation and correction of the mistakes made during the March
      1921 action. If, after this, Levi wants to behave in
      the old way, he will show that his expulsion was justified; and
      the wavering or hesitant workers will be given all the more
      forceful and convincing proof of the absolute correctness of the
      Third Congress decisions concerning Paul Levi.

      Having made a cautious approach at the Congress to the appraisal
      of Levi’s mistakes, I can now say with all the more
      assurance that Levi has hastened to confirm the worst
      expectations. I have before me No. 6 of his magazine Unser
      Weg (of July 15, 1921). It is evident from the editorial
      note printed at the head of the magazine that the decisions of
      the Third Congress are known to Paul Levi. What is his reply to
      them? Menshevik catchwords such as “a great
      excommunication”(grosser Bann ), “canon
      law”(kanonisches Recht ), and that he will
      “quite freely”(in vollständiger Freiheit
      ) “discuss”these decisions. What greater
      freedom can a man have if he has been freed of the title of
      party member and member of the Communist International! And
      please note that he expects party members to write for him, for
      Levi, anonymously!

      First—he plays a dirty trick on the party, hits it in the
      back, and sabotages its work.

      Then—he discusses the essence of the Congress
      decisions.

      That is magnificent.

      But by doing this Levi puts paid to himself.

      Paul Levi wants to continue the fight.

      It will be a great strategic error to satisfy his desire. I
      would advise the German comrades to prohibit all controversy
      with Levi and his magazine in the columns of the daily party
      press. He must not be given publicity. He must not he allowed to
      divert the fighting party’s attention from important
      matters to unimportant ones. In cases of extreme necessity, the
      controversy could be conducted  in weekly or monthly magazines,
      or in pamphlets, and as far as possible care must be taken not
      to afford the K.A.P.-ists and Paul Levi the pleasure they feel
      when they are mentioned by name; reference should simply be made
      to “certain not very clever critics who at all costs want
      to regard themselves as Communists”.

      I am informed that at the last meeting of the enlarged
      C.C. (Ausschuss ), even the Left-winger Friesland was
      compelled to launch a sharp attack on Maslow, who is playing at
      Leftism and wishes to exercise himself in “hunting
      Centrists”. The unreasonableness (to put it mildly) of
      this Maslow’s conduct was also revealed over here, in
      Moscow. Really, this Maslow and two or three of his supporters
      and confederates, who obviously do not wish to observe the
      “peace treaty”and have more zeal than sense, should
      be sent by the German party to Soviet Russia for a year or
      two. We would find useful work for them. We would make men of
      them. And the international and German movement would certainly
      gain thereby.

      The German Communists must at all costs end the internal
      dissension, get rid of the quarrelsome elements on both sides,
      forget about Paul Levi and the K.A.P.-ists and get down to real
      work.

      There is plenty to be done. 

      In my opinion, the tactical and organisational resolutions of
      the Third Congress of the Communist International mark a great
      step forward. Every effort must be exerted to really put both
      resolutions into effect. This is a difficult matter, but it can
      and should be done.

      First, the Communists had to proclaim their principles to the
      world. That was done at the First Congress. It was the first
      step.

      The second step was to give the Communist International
      organisational form and to draw up conditions for affiliation to
      it—conditions making for real separation from the
      Centrists, from the direct and indirect agents of the
      bourgeoisie within the working-class movement. That was done at
      the Second Congress.

      At the Third Congress it was necessary to start practical,
      constructive work, to determine concretely, taking account of
      the practical experience of the communist struggle already
      begun, exactly what the line of further activity should
      be in respect of tactics and of organisation. We have taken this
      third step. We have an army of Communists all over the world. It
      is still poorly trained and poorly organised. It would be
      extremely harmful to forget this truth or be afraid of admitting
      it. Submitting ourselves to a most careful and rigorous test,
      and studying the experience of our own movement, we must train
      this army efficiently; we must organise it properly, and test it
      in all sorts of manoeuvres, all sorts of battles, in attack and
      in retreat. We cannot win without this long and hard
      schooling.

      The “crux”of the situation in the international
      communist movement in the summer of 1921 was that some of the
      best and most influential sections of the Communist
      International did not quite properly understand this task;
      they exaggerated the “struggle against
      Centrism”ever so slightly ; they went ever so
      slightly beyond the border line at which this struggle
      turns into a pastime and revolutionary Marxism begins to be
      compromised.

      That was the “crux”of the Third Congress.

      The exaggeration was a slight one; but the danger arising out of
      it was enormous. It was difficult to combat it, because the
      exaggerating was done by really the best and most loyal
      elements, without whom the formation of the Communist
      International would, perhaps, have been impossible. In the
      tactical amendments published in the newspaper Moskau[5] in German, French and English and
      signed by the German, Austrian and Italian delegations, this
      exaggeration was definitely revealed—the more so because
      these amendments were proposed to a draft resolution that was
      already final (following long and all-round preparatory work):
      The rejection of these amendments was a straightening
      out of the line of the Communist International; it was a
      victory over the danger of exaggeration.

      Exaggeration, if not corrected, was sure to kill the Communist
      International. For “no one in the world can compromise the
      revolutionary Marxists, if they do not compromise
      themselves”. No one in the world will be able to prevent
      the victory of the Communists over the Second and the
      Two-and-a-Half Internationals (and under the conditions
      prevailing in twentieth-century Western Europe and America,
      after the first imperialist war, this means victory over the
      bourgeoisie) unless the Communists prevent it
      themselves.

      Exaggeration, however slight, means preventing victory.

      Exaggeration of the struggle against Centrism means saving
      Centrism, means strengthening its position, its influence
      over the workers.

      In the period between the Second and the Third Congresses, we
      learned to wage a victorious struggle against Centrism on an
      international scale. This is proved by the facts. We will
      continue to wage this struggle (expulsion of Levi and of
      Serrati’s party) to the end.

      We have, however, not yet learned, on an international
      scale, to combat wrong exaggerations in the struggle against
      Centrism. But we have become conscious of this defect, as has
      been proved by the course and outcome of the Third Congress. And
      precisely because we have become conscious of our defect we
      will rid ourselves of it.

      And then we shall be invincible, because without support inside
      the proletariat (through the medium of the bourgeois agents of
      the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals) the
      bourgeoisie in Western Europe and America cannot retain
      power.

      More careful, more thorough preparation for fresh and more
      decisive battles, both defensive and offensive—that is the
      fundamental and principal thing in the decisions of the Third
      Congress.

      “. . . Communism will become a mass force in Italy if the
      Italian Communist Party unceasingly and steadily fights the
      opportunist policy of Serratism and at the same time is able to
      maintain close contact with the proletarian masses in the trade
      unions, during strikes, during clashes with the
      counter-revolutionary fascist organisations; if it is able to
      merge the movements of all the working-class organisations and
      to transform the spontaneous outbreaks of the working class into
      carefully prepared battles. . . .”

      “The United Communist Party of Germany will be the better
      able to carry out mass action, the better it adapts its fighting
      slogans to the actual situation in future, the more thoroughly
      it studies the situation, and the more co-ordinated and
      disciplined the action it conducts. . . ."


      Such are the most pertinent passages of the tactical resolution
      of the Third Congress.

      To win over the majority of the proletariat to our
      side—such is the “principal task”(the heading
      of Point 3 of the resolution on tactics).

      Of course, we do not give the winning of the majority a formal
      interpretation, as do the knights of philistine
      “democracy”of the Two-and-a-Half International. When
      in Rome, in July 1921, the entire proletariat—the
      reformist proletariat of the trade unions and the Centrists of
      Serrati’s party—followed the Communists
      against the fascists, that was winning over the
      majority of the working class to our side.

      This was far, very far, from winning them decisively; it was
      doing so only partially, only momentarily, only locally. But it
      was winning over the majority, and that is possible even if,
      formally, the majority of the proletariat follow bourgeois
      leaders, or leaders who pursue a bourgeois policy (as do all the
      leaders of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals), or
      if the majority of the proletariat are wavering. This winning
      over is gaining ground steadily in every way throughout the
      world. Let us make more thorough and careful preparations for
      it; let us not allow a single serious opportunity to slip by
      when the bourgeoisie compels the proletariat to undertake a
      struggle; let us learn to correctly determine the moment when
      the masses of the proletariat cannot but rise together
      with us.

      Then victory will be assured, no matter how severe some of the
      defeats and transitions in our great campaign may be.

      Our tactical and strategic methods (if we take them on an
      international scale) still lag behind the excellent strategy of
      the bourgeoisie, which has learned from the example of Russia
      and will not let itself be “taken by surprise”. But
      our forces are greater, immeasurably greater; we are learning
      tactics and strategy; we have advanced this
      “science”on the basis of the mistakes of the March
      1921 action. We shall completely master this
      “science”.

      In the overwhelming majority of countries, our parties are still
      very far from being what real Communist Parties should be; they
      are far from being real vanguards of the genuinely revolutionary
      and only revolutionary class,  with every single member taking
      part in the struggle, in the movement, in the everyday life of
      the masses. But we are aware of this defect, we brought it out
      most strikingly in the Third Congress resolution on the work of
      the Party. And we shall overcome this defect.

      Comrades, German Communists, permit me to conclude by expressing
      the wish that your party congress on August 22 will with a firm
      hand put a stop once and for all to the trivial struggle against
      those who have broken away on the left and the
      right. Inner-party struggles must stop! Down with everyone who
      wants to drag them out, directly or indirectly. We know our
      tasks today much more clearly, concretely and thoroughly than we
      did yesterday; we are not afraid of pointing openly to our
      mistakes in order to rectify them. We shall now devote all the
      Party’s efforts to improving its organisation, to
      enriching the quality and content of its work, to creating
      closer contact with the masses, and to working out increasingly
      correct and accurate working-class tactics and strategy.
With communist greetings,

Endnotes
[1] Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (V. K. P. D . ) (United Communist Party of Germany ) was formed at the Unity Congress of the German Communist Party and the Left wing of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany. It was held in Berlin from December 4 to 7, 1920. In October 1920, the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany split at the Congress in Halle when the majority demanded immediate affiliation to the Third International and complete adoption of the 21 conditions of affiliation worked out by the Second Congress of the Comintern. The Right wing of the party walked out of the Halle Congress and, under the old name, formed a separate party, which later, in September 1922, joined the Social-Democratic Party. 
 Lenin sent his letter to the Second Congress of the German Communist party, which was held in Jena from August 22 to 26, 1921. The items on the agenda were: the Third Congress of the Comintern; the party’s immediate tasks; trade union activity; the famine in Soviet Russia and ways of helping her, etc. One of the chairmen as Wilhelm Pieck. A resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority approved the decisions of the Third Congress of the Comintern and acknowledged the correctness of the criticism in the theses of the Third Congress of the party’s mistakes during the March 1921 uprising. The party resumed its old name of the Communist Party of Germany.
[2] The Basle Manifesto of 1912 on war was adopted by the Extraordinary International Socialist Congress in Basle held on November 24-25, 1912. It warned the peoples of the danger of a world-wide imperialist war, exposed its predatory aims and called on the workers to fight for peace, confronting “capitalist imperialism with the international solidarity of the proletariat”. The Manifesto included Lenin’s clause, taken from the Stuttgart Congress resolution (1907), that in the event of the outbreak of an imperialist war, the Socialists should utilise the economic and political crisis caused by the war to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule and fight for a socialist revolution.
[3] Sowjet (Soviet )—a monthly published in Berlin from 1919 to July 1921. It was edited by Paul Levi, and among its contributors were Henriette Roland-Holst, Paul Frölich, Adolf Maslow, Fritz Geyer, and others. From July 1, 1921, when Paul Levi was expelled from the United Communist Party of Germany, the magazine changed its political complexion and adopted the name of Unser Weg (Our Way ). It was closed down at the end of 1922.
[4] Die Rote Fahne (The Red Banner )—a paper founded by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg as the Central Organ of the Spartacus League; it later became the Central Organ of the Communist Party of Germany. It was published in Berlin from November 9, 1918, but was continuously harassed and repeatedly closed down by the authorities. 
 The paper played an important role in turning the Communist Party into a truly mass proletarian and revolutionary party, free from all kinds of opportunists. It stood for united working class action against the country’s militarisation and the spread of nazism. Ernst Thalmann, Chairman of the C.C. of the Communist Party of Germany, was an active contributor. After the nazi dictatorship was set up, the paper was closed down but continued to appear illegally. From 1935 it was issued in Prague and from October 1936 to late 1939, in Brussels.
[5] Moskau in German (Nos. 1-50), Moscou in French (Nos. 1-44) and Moscow in English (Nos. 1-41) was the organ of the Third Congress of the Communist International and was published in Moscow.
