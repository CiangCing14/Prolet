       This article contains Lenin’s famous April Theses read by him at
      two meetings of the All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’
      and Soldiers’ Deputies, on April 4, 1917.
    

[Introduction]
I did not arrive in Petrograd until the night of April 3, and
      therefore at the meeting on April 4, I could, of course, deliver the
      report on the tasks of the revolutionary proletariat
      only on my own behalf, and with reservations as to insufficient
      preparation.
    
The only thing I could do to make things easier for myself—and for honest opponents—was to prepare the theses
      in writing. I read them out, and gave the text to Comrade Tsereteli. I
      read them twice very slowly: first at a meeting of Bolsheviks
      and then at a meeting of both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
    
I publish these personal theses of mine with only the briefest
      explanatory notes, which were developed in far greater detail in the report.
    
THESES

      1) In our attitude towards the war, which
      under the new [provisional] government of
      Lvov and
      Co. unquestionably remains on Russia’s part a predatory imperialist
      war owing to the capitalist nature of that government, not the
      slightest concession to “revolutionary defencism” is permissible.
    
The class-conscious proletariat can give its consent to a revolutionary
      war, which would really justify revolutionary defencism, only on condition:

    

      (a) that the power pass to the proletariat and the poorest sections of
      the peasants aligned with the proletariat;

    

      (b) that all annexations be
      renounced in deed and not in word;

    

      (c) that a complete break be effected
      in actual fact with all capitalist interests.
    
In view of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections of the
      mass believers in revolutionary defencism who accept the war only as a
      necessity, and not as a means of conquest,

 

  in view of the fact that
      they are being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary with
      particular thoroughness, persistence and patience to explain their
      error to them, to explain the inseparable connection existing between
      capital and the imperialist war, and to prove that without
      overthrowing capital it is impossible to end the war by a
      truly democratic peace, a peace not imposed by violence.
    
The most widespread campaign for this view must be organised in
      the army at the front.
    
Fraternisation.
    

      2) The specific feature of the present situation in Russia is that the
      country is passing from the first stage of the revolution—which, 
  owing to the insufficient class-consciousness and
      organisation of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the
      bourgeoisie—to its second stage, which must place
      power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the
      peasants.
    

       This transition is characterised, on the one hand, by a maximum of
      legally recognised rights (Russia is now the freest of all
      the belligerent countries in the world); on the other, by the absence
      of violence towards the masses, and, finally, by their unreasoning
      trust in the government of capitalists, those worst enemies of peace
      and socialism.
    

  This peculiar situation demands of us an ability to adapt ourselves
      to the special conditions of Party work among unprecedentedly
      large masses of proletarians who have just awakened to political life.
    

      3) No support for the Provisional
Government; the utter falsity of all its promises should be made
      clear, particularly of those relating to the renunciation of
      annexations. Exposure in place of the impermissible, illusion-breeding
      “demand” that this government, a government of capitalists,
      should cease to be an imperialist government.
    

      4) Recognition of the fact that in most of the Soviets of Workers’
      Deputies our Party is in a minority, so far a small minority, as
      against a bloc of all the petty-bourgeois
opportunist
      elements, from the Popular
Socialists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      down to the Organising
Committee
(Chkheidze,
      Tsereteli,
      etc.), Steklov, etc., etc., who have yielded to the influence of the
      bourgeoisie and spread that influence among the proletariat.
    


      The masses must be made to see that the Soviets of
      Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of revolutionary
      government, and that therefore our task is, as long as this
      government yields to the influence of the bourgeoisie, to present a
      patient, systematic, and persistent explanation of the errors of their
      tactics, an explanation especially adapted to the practical
      needs of the masses.
    

      As long as we are in the minority we carry on the work of
      criticising and exposing errors and at the same time we preach
      the necessity of transferring the entire state power to the
      Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, so that the people may overcome
      their mistakes by experience.
    

      5) Not a parliamentary republic—to return to a parliamentary republic from
      the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies would be a retrograde step—but a republic
      of Soviets of Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies
      throughout the country, from top to bottom.
    
Abolition of the police, the army and the
bureaucracy.[1]

The salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective and displaceable
      at any time, not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker.
    

      6) The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to be shifted to the Soviets
  of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.

Confiscation of all landed estates.

Nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to
      be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ and
      Peasants’ Deputies.  The organisation of separate Soviets of Deputies
      of Poor Peasants. The setting up of a model farm on each of the large
      estates (ranging in size from 100 to 300 dessiatines,
      according to local and other conditions, and to the decisions of the
      local bodies) under the control of the Soviets of Agricultural
      Labourers’ Deputies and for the public account.
    

      7) The immediate union of all banks in the country into a single national
      bank, and the institution of control over it by the Soviet of Workers’
      Deputies.
    



      8) It is not our immediate task to “introduce” socialism, but
      only to bring social production and the distribution of products at
      once under the control of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies.
    

      9) Party tasks:
    

      (a) Immediate convocation of a Party congress;

    

      (b) Alteration of
      the Party Programme, mainly:
    

      (1) On the question of imperialism and the imperialist war,
    

      (2) On our attitude towards the state and our demand for a “commune
  state”[2];
    

      (3) Amendment of our out-of-date minimum programme;
    

      (c) Change of the Party’s
      name.[3]


      10. A new International.
    
We must take the initiative in creating a revolutionary
      International, an International against the social-chauvinists
      and against the “Centre”.[4]

In order that the reader may understand why I had especially to
      emphasise as a rare exception the “case” of honest opponents, I invite
      him to compare the above theses with the following objection by
      Mr. Goldenberg:

    

       Lenin, he said, “has planted the banner of civil war in the midst of
      revolutionary democracy”

    

      (quoted in No. 5 of Mr. Plekhanov’s
Yedinstvo).
    
 Isn’t it a gem?
    
I write, announce and elaborately explain: “In view
      of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections of the
      mass believers in revolutionary defencism ... in view of the
      fact that they are being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary
      with particular thoroughness, persistence and
      patience to explain their error to them....”
    

Yet the bourgeois gentlemen who call themselves Social-Democrats,
   who do not belong either to the broad sections or to 
   the mass believers in defencism, with serene brow present my views thus:

    

      “The banner[!] of civil war” (of which there is not a word in the
      theses and not a word in my speech!) has been planted(!) “in the midst
      [!!] of revolutionary democracy...”.
    
 What does this mean? In what way does this differ from
      riot-inciting agitation, from Russkaya
Volya?
    
I write, announce and elaborately explain: “The
      Soviets of Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of
      revolutionary government, and therefore our task is to present a
      patient, systematic, and persistent explanation of the errors
      of their tactics, an explanation especially adapted to the practical
      needs of the masses.”
    
Yet opponents of a certain brand present my views as a call to
      “civil war in the midst of revolutionary democracy”!
    
I attacked the Provisional Government for not having
      appointed an early date or any date at all, for the convocation of the
      Constituent
Assembly, and for confining itself to promises. I argued that
      without the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies the
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly is not guaranteed and its
      success is impossible.
    
And the view is attributed to me that I am opposed to the speedy
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly!
    
I would call this “raving”, had not decades of political struggle
      taught me to regard honesty in opponents as a rare exception.
    
Mr. Plekhanov
      in his paper called my speech “raving”. Very good, Mr. Plekhanov! But
      look how awkward, uncouth and slow-witted you are in your polemics. If
      I delivered a raving speech for two hours, how is it that an audience
      of hundreds tolerated this “raving”? Further, why does your paper
      devote a whole column to an account of the “raving”? Inconsistent,
      highly inconsistent!
    

It is, of course, much easier to shout, abuse, and howl than to
      attempt to relate, to explain, to recall what Marx and Engels
      said in 1871, 1872 and 1875 about the experience of the Paris
Commune and about the kind of state the proletariat
      needs. [See:
The Civil
  War in France and Critique of the
  Gotha Programme]

Ex-Marxist Mr. Plekhanov evidently does not care to recall Marxism.
    
I quoted the words of Rosa
 Luxemburg, who on August 4,
 1914, called

German
Social-Democracy a “stinking corpse”. And the Plekhanovs,
      Goldenbergs and Co. feel “offended”. On whose behalf? On behalf of the
      German chauvinists, because they were called chauvinists!
    
They have got themselves in a mess, these poor Russian 
social-chauvinists—socialists in word and chauvinists in deed.
    
 

 
Notes
 

[1]


i.e. the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the whole people.—Lenin

[2]


i.e., a state of which the Paris
Commune was the prototype.—Lenin

[3]


      Instead of “Social-Democracy”, whose official
      leaders throughout the world have betrayed socialism and deserted to the
      bourgeoisie (the “defencists” and the vacillating “Kautskyites”), 
  we must call ourselves the Communist Party.—Lenin

[4]


  The “Centre” in
      the international Social-Democratic movement is the trend which
      vacillates between the chauvinists (=“defencists”) and
      internationalists, i.e., Kautsky and Co. in Germany, Longuet and
      Co. in France, Chkheidze and Co. in Russia, Turati and Co. in Italy,
      MacDonald and Co. in Britain, etc.—Lenin

This article was a report to the Executive Committee of the
      Petrograd Soviet made by Lenin the day after his arrival in
      Petrograd on April 4 (17), 1917, on behalf of the emigrants who
      returned from Switzerland together with him.


The news that the British and French governments have refused to
      grant the emigrant internationalists passage to Russia has
      already made its way into the socialist press.


The thirty-two political emigrants of various party affiliations
      (among them 19 Bolsheviks,
6 Bundists,[2]
      3 adherents of the Paris internationalist paper Nashe
      Slovo[3]) who have arrived here consider it their duty to make
      known the following:


We are in possession of a number of documents which we shall
      publish as soon as we receive them from Stockholm (we left them
      behind because the Swedish-Russian border is under the full
      control of agents of the British Government), and which will
      give everyone a clear picture of the deplorable role the
      above-named “Allied” governments are playing in this
      connection. On this point we shall add only the following: The
      Zurich Emigrants’ Repatriation Committee, which consists of
      representatives of twenty-three groups (including the Central
      Committee, the Organising Committee, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the Bund), unanimously passed a
      resolution stating publicly that the British Government decided
      to prevent the emigrant internationalists from returning to
      their native land and taking part in the struggle against the
      imperialist war.


From the first days of the revolution this intention on the part
      of the British Government had become quite clear to the
      emigrants. At a conference of representatives of the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party (M.A. Natalison), the Organising
      Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. (L. Martov), and the Bund
      (Kosovsky), a plan was conceived (it was proposed

    

by L. Martov)
      to obtain for these emigrants passage through Germany in
      exchange for German and Austrian prisoners interned in Russia.
    

A number of telegrams to this effect were sent to Russia, while
      steps were taken through the Swiss socialists to get this plan
      put through.
    

The telegrams sent to Russia were held up, apparently by our
      Provisional “Revolutionary Government” (or its supporters).
    

After waiting two weeks for an answer from Russia, we decided to
      carry out the above-mentioned plan by ourselves (other emigrants
      decided to wait a little longer, being still unconvinced that
      the Provisional Government would do nothing to ensure the
      passage of all emigrants).


The whole business was handled by Fritz Platten, a Swiss
      internationalist socialist. He concluded a Carefully worded
      agreement with the German Ambassador in Switzerland. The text of
      this agreement will be published later. Its main points are:

    

      (1) All emigrants, regardless of their opinions on the war,
          shall be allowed passage.

    

      (2) The railway coach in which the emigrants will travel shall
          have the privileges of extraterritoriality; no one shall
          have the right to enter the coach without Platten’s
          permission; there shall be no control either of passports or
          luggage.

    

      (3) The travellers agree to agitate in Russia that the emigrants
          who have been granted passage be exchanged for a
          corresponding number of Austro-German internees.
    

All attempts on the part of the German Social-Democratic
      majority to communicate with the travellers were firmly repelled
      by the latter. The coach was accompanied by Platten all the
      way. He had decided to travel with us to Petrograd but be has
      been detained at the Russian border (Tornio)—let us hope,
      only temporarily. All negotiations were conducted with the
      participation of and in complete accord with a number of foreign
      internationalist socialists. The protocol of the journey was
      signed by two French socialists, Loriot and Guilbeaux, and by a
      socialist from the Liebknecht group (Hartstein), by the Swiss
      socialist Platten, the Polish Social-Democrat Broziski, the
      Swedish Social-Democrat deputies Lindhagen, Carleson,
      Ström, Ture Nerman and others.
    
 

      “Were Karl Liebknecht in Russia now, the Milyukovs would readily
      let him out to go to Germany; the Bethmann-Holiwegs let you
      Russian internationalists out to go to Russia. Your business is
      to go to Russia and fight there against both German and Russian
      imperialism.”

    
That is what these internationalist comrades told us. We think
      they were right. We shall make a report of our journey to the
      Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies. We hope that the latter will obtain the release of a
      corresponding number of internees, first and foremost the
      prominent Austrian socialist, Otto Bauer, and that it will
      obtain a permit for all emigrants, not only the social-patriots,
      to return to Russia. We hope that the Executive Committee will
      put an end also to the unheard-of state of affairs, where no
      newspapers left of
Rech[4]
      are allowed to be sent out of the country, and even the
      Manifesto of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies[5] to the
      workers of the world is not allowed to get into the foreign
      press.

Lenin refers to the appeal of the Petrograd Soviet “To the
      Peoples of the World”, adopted at its meeting on March 14 (21),
      1917, and published the next day in the central newspapers. The
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders were obliged to
      issue this appeal under pressure from the revolutionary masses,
      who demanded an end to the war.


The appeal called upon the working people of the belligerent
      countries to come out in favour of peace. It did not, however,
      expose the predatory nature of the war, did not propose any
      practical steps in the fight for peace, and in effect, justified
      the continuation of the imperialist war by the



bourgeois

Provisional Government.

Capitalist newspapers like Rech
      and Novoye
      Vremya[3] have published articles attacking our passage through
      Germany and insinuating that the new arrivals were aiding the
      German
imperialists.[1]


Izvestia
      of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies[4] reprints in
      full the report published in yesterday’s
Pravda[2]
[5]

which
      was presented to the Executive Committee of the Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on the very first day
      after our arrival. In addition to the report, Izvestia publishes
      the resolution of the Executive Committee, which it gives in the
      following words:



      “Having heard the report of Comrades Zurabov and Zinoviev, the
      Executive Committee decided to take the matter up immediately
      with the Provisional Government and to take steps towards
      securing the immediate return to Russia of all emigrants,
      irrespective of their political views and their attitude towards
      the war. The results of the negotiations with the government
      will be published in the near future.—Editors.”



Here you have a small—a very small, but very
      characteristic—picture of two worlds. One, the world of the
      capitalists,
      Rech, Russkaya Volya, Novoye Vremya, dark
      hints, vile
      insinuations against the socialists; the other, the world of the
      revolutionary democrats, of the workers’ and soldiers’ deputies,
      who in a calm, consistent, and dignified manner have decided to
      “take steps”. Steps leading to what? Steps leading to
      what was not done by the Provisional Government!

 

Is this not tantamount to a censure of the Provisional
      Government?  

And is not this censure warranted?  

Mind you, the
      Executive Committee, in passing this resolution, was fully aware
      of the political dissensions that existed between it
      and the Bolsheviks. For capitalists this would be a pretext for
      insinuations. Human dignity is something one need not look for
      in the world of capitalists.


 
Notes
 

[1]
The famous—notoriously famous—Russkaya Volya in its
      article against us provides “incriminating” material quite in
      the vein of Rech. Won’t Milyukov and Co. be ashamed of such a
      neighbour?
—Lenin

[2]
Will Rech dare to publish it?
—Lenin

      (1) Economic debacle is imminent. Therefore removal of the
      bourgeoisie is a mistake.
    

      (This is the conclusion of the bourgeoisie. The more imminent
      the debacle, the more essential is it that the bourgeoisie be
      removed.)
    

      (2) Proletariat is unorganised, weak, lacking
         class-consciousness.
    

      (True. Therefore, the whole task is to fight those
      petty-bourgeois leaders, the so-called
      Social-Democrats–Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Steklov—who lull the
      masses,
      encourage them to put their trust in the bourgeoisie.
    

Not unity with these petty bourgeois—Chkheidze, Steklov,
      Tsereteli—but utter defeat of these
      Social-Democrats, who are ruining the revolution of the
      proletariat.)
    

      (3) Revolution is bourgeois at the present stage. Therefore no
          need for “socialist experiment”.
    

      (This argument is an
          out-and-out bourgeois argument. No one talks about a
          “socialist experiment” The concrete Marxist proposition
          requires that institutions now as well as classes be taken
          into account.)
    

Stranglers of the revolution, by honeyed phrases—Chkheidze,
      Tsereteli, Steklov—are dragging the revolution back, away
      from the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies towards the
      undivided sway of the bourgeoisie, towards the usual bourgeois
      parliamentary republic.
    

We must ably, carefully, clear people’s minds and lead the
      proletariat and poor peasantry forward, away from “dual
      power” towards the full power of the Soviets of

    

      Workers’ Deputies, and this is the commune in Marx’s sense, in
      the sense of the experience of 1871.
    

The question is not how fast to move, but where to move.
    

The question is not whether the workers are prepared, but
      how and for what they should be prepared.
    

Since the manifestos and appeals of the Soviet of Workers’
      Deputies on the war, etc., are sheer petty-bourgeois humbug
      designed merely to lull the people to sleep, it is our business
      above all, as I have said, to clear people’s minds, to rid the
      masses of the bourgeois influence of Chkheidze,
      Steklov, Tsereteli and Co.
    

The “revolutionary defencism” of the Soviet of Workers Deputies,
      i.e., of Chkheidze, Tsereteli and Steklov, is a chauvinist trend
      a hundred times more harmful for being cloaked in honeyed
      phrases, an attempt to reconcile the masses with the
      Provisional Revolutionary Government.
    

The dull, unenlightened masses duped by Chkheidze, Tsereteli,
      Steklov and Co. do not realise that the war is a continuation of
      policy, that wars are waged by governments.
    

It must be made clear that the “people” can stop the war or
      change its character only by changing the class
      character of the government.

Louis Blanc, the French socialist, won unenviable notriety
      during the revolution of 1848 by changing his stand from that of
      the class struggle to that of petty-bourgeois illusions,
      illusions adorned with would-be “socialist” phraseology, but in
      reality tending to strengthen the influence of the bourgeoisie
      over the proletariat. Louis Blanc looked to the bourgeoisie for
      assistance, hoped, and inspired hopes in others, that the
      bourgeoisie could help the workers in the matter of
      “labour organisation”—this vague term purporting to express
      “socialist” tendencies.


Blancism has now gained the upper hand in Right-wing
“Social-Democracy”, in the Organising Committee party in
Russia. Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Steklov, and many others, who are now
leaders of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and
were also leaders of the recent All-Russia Conference
of
Soviets,[1] have taken the same stand as Louis Blanc.


On all major issues of present-day political life these leaders, who
occupy approximately the position of the international Centrist trend
represented by Kautsky, Longuet, Turati, and many others, have
embraced the petty-bourgeois views of Louis Blanc. Take, for instance,
the question of war.


The proletarian standpoint in this matter consists of a definite class
characterisation of war, and of an irreconcilable hostility to
imperialist war—that is, to a war between groups of
capitalist countries (no matter whether monarchies or
republics) for a division of capitalist spoils.


The petty-bourgeois viewpoint differs from the bourgeois one (outright
justification of the war, outright “defence of

    

the fatherland”, i.e.,
defence of the interests of one’s own capitalists, defence of
their “right” to annexations) in that the petty bourgeois
“renounces” annexations, “condemns” imperialism, “demands” from the
bourgeoisie that it cease to be imperialistic while keeping within the
framework of world-imperialist relations and the capitalist system of
economy. Confining himself to this mild, innocuous, wishy-washy
declamation, the petty bourgeois, in practice, trail
helplessly behind the bourgeoisie, “sympathising” in some
things with the proletariat in words, remaining dependent on the
bourgeoisie in deeds, unable or unwilling to understand the path
leading to the overthrow of the capitalist yoke, the only path that
can rid the world of imperialism.


To “demand” of the bourgeois governments that they make a “solemn
declaration” in the spirit of renouncing annexations is the
height of audacity on the part of the petty bourgeois, and an example
of anti-imperialist “Zimmerwaldist” consistency. It is not difficult
to see that this is Blancism of the worst type. For one thing, no
bourgeois politician with any experience will ever have difficulty in
mouthing any number of glib, “brilliant”, high-sounding phrases
against annexations “in general”, as meaningless as they are non-
committal. But when it comes to deeds, one can always do a
conjuring trick after the manner of Rech, which had the
deplorable courage to declare that
Kurland[2] (now
annexed by the imperialist predators of bourgeois Germany) was not
annexed by Russia!


This is trickery of the most disgusting kind, the most
shameless deception of the workers by the bourgeoisie, for
anybody the least familiar with politics must know that
Kurland had always been annexed to Russia.


We openly and directly challenge Rech:

    

      (1) to present to the
      people such a political definition of the concept “annexation”
      as would apply equally to all annexations in the world,
      German, British, and Russian, past and present, to all without exception;

    

      (2) to state clearly and definitely what, in
      its opinion, is meant by renunciation of annexations,  not in
      word, but in deed. To give such a political definition of the
      concept “renunciation of annexations in deed” as would
      apply not only to the Germans, but also to the English and
      all other nations who have ever practised annexations.
    
 

We maintain that Rech will either decline to accept our
challenge or it will be exposed by us before the whole nation. And it
is precisely because of this question of Kurland touched upon by
Rech that our dispute is not a theoretical one but a
practical one of the greatest urgency and vital interest.


Second, let us assume, if only for a moment, that the bourgeois
ministers are the ideal of honesty, that the Ouchkovs, Lvovs,
Milyukovs and Co. sincerely believe in the possibility of
renouncing annexations, while preserving capitalism, and that they
really want to renounce them.


Let us, for a moment, assume even this, let us make this
Blancist assumption.


One is entitled to ask: Can a grown-up person be content with what
people think of themselves, without comparing it with what
they do? Is it possible for a Marxist not to
distinguish good wishes and declarations from objective realities?


No. It is not.


Annexations are maintained by the bonds of finance capital, banking
capital, imperialist capital. Herein is the modern, the
economic, foundation of annexations. From this angle, annexations are
politically guaranteed profits on thousands of millions of
capital “invested” in thousands upon thousands of enterprises in the
annexed countries.


It is impossible,  even given the wish to do so, to renounce
annexations without taking decisive steps towards throwing
off the yoke of capitalism.


Does that mean, as Yedinstvo, Rabochezya
Gazeta,[3] and the other “Louis Blancs” of our petty bourgeoisie are
ready to conclude and actually do conclude, that we must not take any
decisive steps towards overthrowing capitalism, that we must accept at
least a modicum of annexations?


No. Decisive steps must be taken towards the overthrow of
capitalism. They must be taken ably and gradually, relying
only on the class-consciousness and organised activity of the
overwhelming majority of the workers and poor peasants. But taken they
must be. The Soviets of Workers’ Deputies have already
started to take them in a number of places in Russia.

 

The order of the day now is a decisive and irrevocable parting of the
ways with the Louis Blancs—the Chkheidzes, Tseretelis, Steklovs,
the party of the O.C., the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc.,
etc. The masses must be made to see that Blancism is ruining and will
utterly ruin the further success of the revolution, even the success
of freedom, unless the masses realise how harmful these
petty-bourgeois illusions are and join the class-conscious workers in
their
cautious, gradual, well-considered, yet firm and direct steps towards
socialism.


Outside of socialism there is no deliverance of humanity
from wars, from hunger, from the destruction of still more
millions and millions of human beings.

The basic question of every revolution is that of state
power. Unless this question is understood, there can be no
intelligent participation in the revolution, not to speak of
guidance of the revolution.


The highly remarkable feature of our revolution is that it has
brought about a dual power. This fact must be grasped
first and foremost: unless it is understood, we cannot
advance. We must know how to supplement and amend old
âformulasâ, for example, those of Bolshevism, for while they
have been found to be correct on the whole, their concrete
realisation has turned out to
be different. Nobody previously thought, or could
have thought, of a dual power.


What is this dual power? Alongside the Provisional Government,
the government of bourgeoisie, another government has
arisen, so far weak and incipient, but undoubtedly a government
that actually exists and is growing—the Soviets of Workersâ
and Soldiersâ Deputies.


What is the class composition of this other government? It
consists of the proletariat and the peasants (in soldiersâ
uniforms). What is the political nature of this government? It
is a revolutionary dictatorship, i.e., a power directly based on
revolutionary seizure, on the direct initiative of the people
from below, and not on a law enacted by a centralised
state power. It is an entirely different kind of power from the
one that generally exists in the parliamentary
bourgeois-democratic republics of the usual type still
prevailing in the advanced countries of Europe and America. This
circumstance often over looked, often not given enough thought,
yet it is the crux of the matter. This power is of
the same type as the Paris
Commune of 1871. The fundamental

    

characteristics of this
type are:


(1) the source of power is not a law previously discussed and
enacted by parliament, but the direct initiative of the
people from below, in their local areas—direct âseizureâ,
to use a current expression;


(2) the replacement of the police and the army, which are
institutions divorced from the people and set against the
people, by the direct arming of the whole people; order in
the state under such a power is maintained by the armed
workers and peasants themselves, by the armed
people themselves ;


(3) officialdom, the bureaucracy, are either similarly replaced
by the direct rule of the people themselves or at least
placed under special control; they not only become elected
officials, but are also subject to recall at the
peopleâs first demand; they are reduced to the position of
simple agents; from a privileged group
holding âjobs â remunerated on a high, bourgeois
scale, they become workers of a special âarm of the
serviceâ, whose remuneration does not exceed the
ordinary pay of a competent worker.


This, and this alone , constitutes the essence 
of the Paris Commune as a special type of state. This essence
has been forgotten or perverted by the Plekhanovs (downright
chauvinists who have betrayed Marxism), the Kautskys (the men of
the âCentreâ, i.e., those who vacillate between chauvinism and
Marxism), and generally by all those Social-Democrats,
Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc., etc., who now rule the roost.


They are trying to get away with empty phrases, evasions,
subterfuges; they congratulate each other a thousand times upon
the revolution, but refuse to consider what the Soviets
of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies are . They refuse to
recognise the obvious truth that in as much as these Soviets
exist, in as much as they are a power, we have in
Russia a state of the type of the Paris Commune.


I have emphasised the words âin as much asâ, for it is only an
incipient power. By direct agreement with the bourgeois
Provisional Government and by a series of actual concessions, it
has itself surrendered and is surrendering its positions
to the bourgeoisie.


Why? Is it because Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Steklov and Co. are
making a âmistakeâ? Nonsense. Only a philistine can think so—not a
Marxist. The reason is insufficient
class-consciousness
    

and organisation of the proletarians
and peasants. The âmistakeâ of the leaders I have named lies in
their petty-bourgeois position, in the fact that instead of
clarifying the minds of the workers, they are befogging 
them; instead of dispelling petty-bourgeois illusions,they are
instilling them; instead of freeing the people from
bourgeois influence, they are strengthening that
influence.


It should be clear from this why our comrades, too, make so many
mistakes when putting the question âsimplyâ: Should the
Provisional Government be overthrown immediately?


My answer is:


(1) it should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, bourgeois,
and not a peopleâs government, and is unable to
provide peace, bread, or full freedom;


(2) It cannot be overthrown just now, for it is being kept in
power by a direct and indirect, a formal and actual
agreement with the Soviets of Workersâ Deputies, and
primarily with the chief Soviet, the Petrograd Soviet;

 (3) generally, it can not be âoverthrownâ in the ordinary way,
for it rests on the âsupport â given to the
bourgeoisie by the second government—the Soviet
of Workersâ Deputies, and that government is the only
possible revolutionary government, which directly expresses
the mind and will of the majority of the workers and
peasants. Humanity has not yet evolved and we do not as yet
know a type of government superior to and better than the
Soviets of Workersâ, Agricultural Labourersâ, Peasantsâ, and
Soldiersâ Deputies.


To become a power the class-conscious workers must win the
majority to their side. As long as no violence is used
against the people there is no other road to power. We are not
Blancists, we do not stand for the seizure of power by a
minority. We are Marxists, we stand for proletarian class
struggle against petty-bourgeois intoxication, against
chauvinism-defencism, phrase-mongering and dependence on the
bourgeoisie.


Let us create a proletarian Communist Party; its elements have
already been created by the best adherents of Bolshevism; let us
rally our ranks for proletarian class work; and larger and
larger numbers from among the proletarians, from among the
poorest peasants will range themselves on our side. For
actual experience will from day to day shatter the
petty-bourgeois illusions of those âSocial-Democratsâ,

    

the
Chkheidzes, Tseretelis, Steklovs and others, the âSocialist
Revolutionariesâ, the petty bourgeois of an even purer water,
and so on and so forth.


The bourgeoisie stands for the undivided power of the
bourgeoisie.


The class-conscious workers stand for the undivided power of the
Soviets of Workersâ, Agricultural Labourersâ, Peasantsâ, and
Soldiersâ Deputies—for undivided power made possible not by
adventurist acts, but by clarifying proletarian minds,
by emancipating them from the influence of the
bourgeoisie.


The petty bourgeoisie—âSocial-Democratsâ, Socialist-Revolutionaries,
etc., etc.—vacillate and, thereby,
hinder this clarification and emancipation.


This is the actual, the class alignment of forces that
determines our tasks.

FOREWORD
On April 4, 1917, I had occasion to make a report on the
subject indicated in the title, first, at a meeting of Bolsheviks
in Petrograd. These were delegates to the All-Russia Conference of
Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, who had to
leave for their homes and therefore could not allow me to postpone
it. After the meeting, the chairman, Comrade G. Zinoviev, asked me
on behalf of the whole assembly to repeat my report immediately at
a joint meeting of Bolshevik and Menshevik delegates, who wished
to discuss the question of unifying the  Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party.

 Difficult though it was for me immediately to repeat my
report, I felt that I had no right to refuse once this was
demanded of me by my comrades-in-ideas as well as by the
Mensheviks, who, because of their impending departure, really
could not grant me a delay. 
In making my report, I read the theses which were published in
No. 26 of Pravda, on
April 7,
1917.[1]
 Both the theses and my report gave rise to differences of
opinion among the Bolsheviks themselves and the editors of
Pravda. After a number of consultations, we unanimously
concluded that it would be advisable openly to discuss
our differences, and thus provide material for the All-Russia
Conference of our Party (the Russian Social-Democratic
    
Labour
Party, united under the Central Committee) which is to meet in
Petrograd on April 20, 1917. 
Complying with this decision concerning a discussion, I am
publishing the following letters in which I do not claim
to have made an exhaustive study of the question, but
wish merely to outline the principal arguments, which are
especially essential for the practical tasks of the
working-class movement. 

 First Letter
       Assesment of the Present Situation 
Marxism requires of us a strictly exact and objectively
verifiable analysis of the relations of classes and of the
concrete features peculiar to each historical situation. We
Bolsheviks have always tried to meet this requirement, which is
absolutely essential for giving a scientific foundation to
policy. 
“Our theory is not a dogma, but a guide to
action,”[10] Marx
and Engels always said, rightly ridiculing the mere memorising and
repetition of “formulas”, that at best are capable only of marking
out general tasks, which are necessarily modifiable by
the concrete economic and political conditions of each
particular period of the historical process. 
What, then, are the clearly established objective facts which the party of the revolutionary
proletariat must now be guided by in defining the tasks and forms
of its activity? 
Both in my first Letter From Afar (“The First Stage
of the First Revolution”) published in Pravda Nos. 14 and
15, March 21 and 22, 1917, and in my theses, I define
“the specific feature of the present situation in Russia” as a
period of  transition from the first stage of the
revolution to the second. I therefore considered the basic slogan,
the “task of the day” at this moment to be: “Workers, you
have performed miracles of proletarian heroism, the heroism of the
people, in the civil war against tsarism. You must perform
miracles of organisation, organisation of the proletariat and of
the whole people, to prepare the way for your
    
victory in the
second stage of the revolution” (Pravda
No. 15).[2]

What, then, is the first stage? 
It is the passing of state power to the bourgeoisie. 
Before the February-March revolution of 1917, state power in Russia was in the hands of one old class, namely,
the feudal landed nobility, headed by Nicholas Romanov. 
After the revolution, the power is in the hands of a
different class, a new class, namely, the
bourgeoisie. 
The passing of state power from one class to another
is the first, the principal, the basic sign of a
revolution, both in the strictly scientific and in the
practical political meaning of that term. 
To this extent, the bourgeois, or the bourgeois-democratic,
revolution in Russia is completed. 
But at this point we hear a clamour of protest from people who
readily call themselves “old Bolsheviks”. Didn’t we always
maintain, they say, that the bourgeois-democratic revolution is
completed only by the “revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry”? Is the agrarian revolution, which
is also a bourgeois-democratic revolution, completed? Is it not a
fact, on the contrary, that it has not even started? 
My answer is: The Bolshevik slogans and ideas on the
whole have been confirmed by history; but concretely
things have worked out diflerently; they are more
original, more peculiar, more variated than anyone could have
expected. 
To ignore or overlook this fact would mean taking after those
“old Bolsheviks” who more than once already have played so
regrettable a role in the history of our Party by reiterating
formulas senselessly learned by rote instead of
studying  the specific features of the new and living
reality. 
’The revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry” has already become a
reality[3]

in the Russian revolution, for this “formula”
envisages only a relation of classes, and not a
concrete political institution implementing this
relation, this co-operation. “The Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies”—there you have the
“revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry” already accomplished in reality. 
This formula is already antiquated. Events have moved it from
tile realm of formulas into the realm of reality, clothed it with
flesh and bone, concretised it and thereby modified
it. 
A new and different task now faces us: to effect a split
within this dictatorship between the proletarian elements
(the anti-defencist, internationalist, “Communist” elements, who
stand for a transition to the commune) and the
small-proprietor or petty-bourgeois  elements (Chkheidze,
Tsereteli, Steklov, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the other
revolutionary defencists, who are opposed to moving towards the
commune and are in favour of “supporting” the bourgeoisie and the
bourgeois
government).[4]

The person who now speaks only of a “revolutionary
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry” is
behind the times, consequently, he has in effect gone
over to the petty bourgeoisie against the proletarian class
struggle; that person should be consigned to the archive of
“Bolshevik” pre-revolutionary antiques (it may be called the
archive of “old Bolsheviks”). 
The revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat
and the peasantry has already been realised, but in a highly
original manner, and with a number of extremely important
modifications. I shall deal with them separately in one of my next
letters. For the present, it is essential to grasp the
incontestable truth that a Marxist must take cognisance of real
life, of the true facts of reality, and not cling to a
theory of yesterday, which, like all theories, at best only
outlines the main and the general, only comes near to
embracing life in all its complexity. 
“Theory, my friend, is grey, but green is the eternal tree of
life.”[11]

To deal with the question of “completion” of the bourgeois
revolution in the old way is to sacrifice living Marxism
to the dead letter. 
According to the old way of thinking, the rule of the
bourgeoisie could and should be followed by the rule of
the proletariat and the peasantry, by their dictatorship. 
In real life, however, things have already turned out differently; there has been an extremely original, novel
and unprecedented interlacing of the one with the other.
We have side by side, existing together, simultaneously,
both the rule of the bourgeoisie (the government of Lvov
and Guchkov) and a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry, which is voluntarily
ceding power to the bourgeoisie, voluntarily making itself an
appendage of the bourgeoisie. 
For it must not be forgotten that actually, in Petrograd, the
power is in the hands of the workers and soldiers; the new
government is not using and cannot use violence against
them, because there is no police, no
army standing apart from the people, no officialdom
standing all-powerful above tbe people. This is a fact,
the kind of fact that is characteristic of a state of the Paris
Commune type. This fact does not fit into the old schemes. One
must know how to adapt schemes to facts, instead of reiterating
the now meaningless words about a “dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry” in general. 
To throw more light on this question let us approach it from
another angle. 
A Marxist must not abandon the ground of careful analysis of
class relations. The bourgeoisie is in power. But is not the mass
of the peasants also a bourgeoisie, only of a different
social stratum, of a different kind, of a different character?
Whence does it follow that this stratum cannot
come to power, thus “completing” the bourgeois-democratic
revolution? Why should this be impossible? 
This is how the old Bolsheviks often argue. 
My reply is that it is quite possible. But, in assessing a
given situation, a Marxist must proceed not from what is
possible, but from what is real. 
And the reality reveals the fact that freely elected
soldiers’ and peasants’ deputies are freely joining
the second, parallel government, and are freely supplementing,
developing and completing it. And, just as freely, they are
surrendering power to the bourgeoisie—a fact
which does not in the least contravene the theory of Marxism, for
we have always known and repeatedly pointed out that the
bourgeoisie maintains itself in power not only by force
but,also by virtue of the lack of class-consciousness and
organisation, the routinism and downtrodden state of the
masses. 
In view of this present-day reality, it is simply ridiculous
to turn one’s back on the fact and talk about
“possibilities”. 
Possibly the peasantry may seize all the land and all the
power. Far from forgetting this possibility, far from confining
myself to the present, I definitely and clearly formulate the
agrarian programme, taking into account the new
phenomenon, i.e., the deeper cleavage between the agricultural
labourers and the poor peasants on the one hand, and the peasant
proprietors on the other. 
But there is also another possibility; it is possible that the
peasants will take the advice of the petty-bourgeois party of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, which has yielded to the influence of
the bourgeoisie, has adopted a defencist stand, and which advises
waiting for the Constituent Assembly, although not even the date
of its convocation has yet been
fixed.[5]

It is possible that the peasants will maintain and
prolong their deal with the bourgeoisie, a deal which they have
now concluded through the Soviets of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies not only in form, but in fact. 
Many things are possible. It would be a great mistake to
forget the agrarian movement and the agrarian programme. But it
would be no less a mistake to forget the reality, which
reveals the fact that an agreement, or—to use a
more exact, less legal, but more class-economic term—class
collaboration exists between the bourgeoisie and
the peasantry. 
When this fact ceases to be a fact, when the peasantry
separates from the bourgeoisie, seizes the land and power despite
the bourgeoisie, that will be a new stage in the
bourgeois-democratic revolution; and that matter will be dealt
with separately. 
 
A Marxist who, in view of the possibility of such a future
stage, were to forget his duties in the present, when the
peasantry is in agreement with the bourgeoisie, would
turn petty bourgeois. For he would in practice be preaching to the
proletariat confidence in the petty bourgeoisie (“this
petty bourgeoisie, this peasantry, must separate from the
bourgeoisie while the bourgeois-democratic revolution is still
on”). Because of the “possibility” of so pleasing and sweet a
future, in which the peasantry would not be the tail of
the bourgeoisie, in which the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the
Chkheidzes, Tseretelis, and Steklovs would not be an
appendage of the bourgeois government—because of the
“possibility” of so pleasing a future, he would be forgetting
the unpleasant present, in which the peasantry still
forms the tail of the bourgeoisie, and in which the Socialist-
Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats have not yet given up their
role as an appendage of the bourgeois government, as “His Majesty”
Lvov’s
Opposition.[12]

This hypothetical person would resemble a sweetish Louis
Blanc, or a sugary Kautskyite, but certainly not a revolutionary
Marxist. 
But are we not in danger of falling into subjectivism, of
wanting to arrive at the socialist revolution by “skipping” the
bourgeois-democratic revolution—which is not yet completed
and has not yet exhausted the peasant movement? 
I might be incurring this danger if I said: “No Tsar, but a
workers’
government.”[13] But I did
not say that, I said something else. I said that there
can be no government (barring a bourgeois government) in
Russia other than that of the Soviets of Workers’,
Agricultural Labourers’, Soldiers’, and
Peasants’ Deputies.I said that power in Russia now can pass
from Guchkov and Lvov only to these Soviets. And in these
Soviets, as it happens, it is the peasants, the soldiers, i.e.,
petty bourgeoisie, who preponderate, to use a scientific, Marxist
term, a class characterisation, and not a common,
man-in-the-street, professional characterisation. 
In my theses, I absolutely ensured myself against skipping over the peasant movement, which has not outlived itself, or the
petty-bourgeois movement in general, against any playing
at “seizure of power” by a workers’ government, against any
kind of Blanquist adventurism; for I pointedly
    
referred to the
experience of the Paris Commune. And this experience, as we know,
and as Marx proved at length in 1871 and Engels in
1891,[14]
absolutely excludes Blanquism, absolutely ensures the direct,
immediate and unquestionable rule of the majority and the
activity of the masses only to the extent that the majority itself
acts consciously. 
In the theses, I very definitely reduced the question to one
of a struggle for influence within the Soviets of
Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’, Peasants’,
and Soldiers’ Deputies.To leave no shadow of doubt on this
score, I twice emphasised in the theses the need for
patient and persistent “explanatory” work “adapted to the
practical needs of the masses”. 
Ignorant persons or renegades from Marxism, like
Mr. Plekhanov, may shout about anarchism, Blanquism, and so
forth. But those who want to think and learn cannot fail to
understand that Blanquism means the seizure of power by a
minority, whereas the Soviets are admittedly the direct
and immediate organisation of the majority of the
people. Work confined to a struggle for influence within
these Soviets cannot, simply cannot, stray into the swamp
of Blanquism. Nor can it stray into the swamp of anarchism, for
anarchism denies the need for a state and state
power in the period of transition from the rule of
the bourgeoisie to the rule of the proletariat, whereas I, with a
precision that precludes any possibility of misinterpretation,
advocate the need for a state in this period, although,
in accordance with Marx and the lessons of the Paris Commune, I
advocate not the usual parliamentary bourgeois state, but a state
without a standing army, without a police
opposed to the people, without an officialdom placed
above the people. 
When Mr. Plekhanov, in his newspaper Yedinstvo,
shouts with all his might that this is anarchism, he is merely
giving further proof of his break with Marxism. Challenged by me
in
Pravda (No. 26)
to tell us what Marx and
Engels taught on the subject in 1871, 1872 and
1875,[6]
Mr. Plekhanov
canonly preserve silence on the question at issue and shout out
abuse after the manner of the enraged bourgeoisie. 
Mr. Plekhanov, the ex-Marxist, has absolutely failed
to understand the Marxist doctrine of the state. Incidentally,the
germs of this lack of understanding are also to he found in his
German pamphlet on
anarchism.[15]


 *     *  * 
Now let
us see how Comrade Y. Kamenev, in Pravda No. 27,
formulates his “disagreements” with my theses and with the views
expressed above. This will help us to grasp them more
clearly. 

“As for Comrade Lenin’s
general scheme,” writes Comrade Kamenev, “it appears to us
unacceptable, inasmuch as it proceeds from the assumption that the
bourgeois-democratic revolution is completed, and builds
on the immediate transformation of this revolution into a
socialist revolution.’ 

There are two big mistakes here. 
First. The question of “completion” of the
bourgeois-democratic revolution is stated wrongly. The
question is put in an abstract, simple, so to speak one-colour,
way, which does not correspond to the objective
reality. To put the question this way, to ask
now “whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution is
completed” and say no more, is to prevent oneself from
seeing the exceedingly complex reality, which, is at least
two-coloured. This is in theory. In practice, it means
surrendering helplessly to petty-bourgeois revolutionism.

Indeed, reality shows us both the passing of power
into the hands of the bourgeoisie (a “completed”
bourgeois-democratic revolution of the usual type) and, side by
side with the real government, the existence of a parallel
government which represents the “revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry”. This “second
government” has itself ceded the power to the
bourgeoisie, has chained itself to the bourgeois
government. 
Is this reality covered by Comrade Kamenev’s
old-Bolshevik formula, which says that “the bourgeois-democratic
revolution is not completed”? 
It is not. The formula is obsolete. It is no good at all. It
is dead. And it is no use trying to revive it. 
Second. A practical question. Who knows whether it is still
possible at present for a special “revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry”,
detached
    
from the bourgeois government, to emerge in
Russia? Marxist tactics cannot be based on the unknown. 
But if this is still possible, then there is one, and
only one, way towards it, namely, an immediate, resolute, and
irrevocable separation of the proletarian Communist elements from
the petty-bourgeois elements. 
Why? 
Because the entire petty bourgeoisie has, not by chance but of
necessity, turned towards chauvinism (=defencism), towards
“support” of the bourgeoisie, towards dependence on it, towards
the fear of having to do without it, etc., etc. 
How can the petty bourgeoisie be “pushed” into power, if even
now it can take the power, but does not want to? 
This can be done only by separating the proletarian, the
Communist, party, by waging a proletarian class struggle free
from the timidity of those petty bourgeois. Only the
consolidation of the proletarians who are free from the influence
of the petty bourgeoisie in deed and not only in word can make the
ground so hot under the feet of the petty bourgeoisie that it will
be obliged under certain circumstances to take the power;
it is even within the bounds of possibility that Guchkov and
Milyukov—again under certain circumstances—will be
forgiving full and sole power to Chkheidze, Tsereteli, the S.R.s,
and Steklov, since, after all, these are “defencists”.

To separate the proletarian elements of the Soviets (i.e., the
proletarian, Communist, party) from the petty-bourgeois elements
right now, immediately and irrevocably, is to give correct
expression to the interests of the movement in either of
two possible events: in the event that Russia will yet experience
a special “dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry”
independent of the bourgeoisie, and in the event that the petty
bourgeoisie will not be able to tear itself away from the
bourgeoisie and will oscillate eternally (that is, until socialism
is established) between us and it. 
To be guided in one’s activities merely by the simple
formula, “the bourgeois-democratic revolution is not completed”,
is like taking it upon oneself to guarantee that the petty
bourgeoisie is definitely capable of being independent of the
bourgeoisie. To do so is to throw oneself at the given moment on
the mercy of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 
Incidentally, in connection with the “formula” of the
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, it is worth
mentioning that, in Two Tactics (July 1905), I made a
point of emphasising (Twelve Years,
p. 435[16]) this: 
“Like everything else in the world, the
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry has a past and a future. Its past is autocracy, serfdom,
monarchy, and privilege....Its future is the struggle against
private property, the struggle of the wage-worker against the
employer, the struggle for
socialism....”[7]

Comrade Kamenev’s mistake is that even in 1917 he sees
only the past of the revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. As a matter of
fact its future has already begun, for the interests and
policies of the wage-worker and the petty proprietor have
actually diverged already, even in such an important
question as that of “defencism”, that of the attitude towards the
imperialist war. 
This brings me to the second mistake in Comrade
Kamenev’s argument quoted above. He criticises me, saying
that my scheme “builds” on “the immediate transformation of this
{bourgeois-democratic} revolution into a socialist
revolution”. 
This is incorrect. I not only do not “build” on the “immediate
transformation” of our revolution into a socialist one,
but I actually warn against it, when
in Thesis
No. 8, I state:

“It is not our immediate task to
’introduce’
socialism...”.[8]

Is it not clear that no person who builds on the immediate
transformation of our revolution into a socialist revolution could
be opposed to the immediate task of introducing socialism? 
Moreover, even a “commune state” (i.e., a state organised
along the lines of the Paris Commune) cannot be
introduced in Russia “immediately”, because to do that it would be
necessary for the majority of the deputies in all (or in
most) Soviets to clearly recognise all the erroneousness and harm
of the tactics and policy pursued by the S.R.s, Chkheidze,
Tsereteli, Steklov, etc. As for me, I declared unmistakably that
in this respect I “build” only on “patient” explaining
    
(does one
have to be patient to bring about a change which can be effected
“immediately”?). 
Comrade Kamenev has somewhat overreached himself in his
eagerness, and has repeated the bourgeois prejudice about the
Paris Commune having wanted to introduce socialism
“immediately”. This is not so. The Commune, unfortunately, was too
slow in introducing socialism. The real essence of the Commune is
not where the bourgeois usually looks for it, but in the creation
of a state of a special type. Such a state has
already arisen in Russia, it is the Soviets of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies! 
Comrade Kamenev has not pondered on the fact, the
significance, of the existing Soviets, their identity, in
point of type and socio-political character, with the commune
state, and instead of studying the fact, he began to talk
about something I was supposed to be “building” on for the
“immediate” future. The result is, unfortunately, a repetition of
the method used by many bourgeois: from the question as to
what are the Soviets, whether they are of a
higher type than a parliamentary republic, whether they
are more useful for the people, more democratic, more
convenient for the struggle, for combating, for instance, the
grain shortage, etc.—from this real, urgent, vital issue,
attention is diverted to the empty, would-be scientific, but
actually hollow, professorially dead question of “building on an
immediate transformation”. 
An idle question falsely presented. I “build”
only on this, exclusively on this—that
the workers, soldiers and peasants will deal better than the
officials, better than the police, with the difficult
practical, problems of producing more grain, distributing
it better and keeping the soldiers better supplied, etc.,
etc. 
I am deeply convinced that the Soviets will make the
independent activity of the masses a reality more quickly
and effectively than will a parliamentary republic (I shall
compare the two types of states in greater detail in another
letter). They will more effectively, more practically and more
correctly decide what steps can be taken towards
socialism and how these steps should be taken. Control over abank,
the merging of all banks into one, is not yet socialism,
but it is a step towards socialism. Today such steps are
being
    
taken in Germany by the Junkers and the bourgeoisie against
the people. Tomorrow the Soviet will be able to take these steps
more effectively for the benefit of the people if the whole state
power is in its hands. 
What compels such steps? 
Famine. Economic disorganisation. Imminent collapse. The
horrors of war. The horrors of the wounds inflicted on mankind by
the war. 
Comrade Kamenev concludes his article with the remark that “in
a broad discussion he hopes to carry his point of view, which is
the only possible one for revolutionary Social-Democracy if it
wishes to and should remain to the very end the party of the
revolutionary masses of the proletariat and not turn into a group
of Communist propagandists”. 
It seems to me that these words betray a completely erroneous
estimate of the situation. Comrade Kamenev contraposes to a
“party of the masses” a “group of propagandists”. But the
“masses” have now succumbed to the craze of “revolutionary”
defencism. Is it not more becoming for internationalists at this
moment to show that they can resist “mass” intoxication rather
than to “wish to remain” with the masses, i.e., to succumb to
the general epidemic? Have we not seen how in all the
belligerent countries of Europe the chauvinists tried to justify
themselves on the grounds that they wished to “remain with the
masses”? Must we not be able to remain for a time in the
minority against the “mass” intoxication? Is It not the work of
the propagandists at the present moment that forms the key point
for disentangling the proletarian line from the
defencist and petty-bourgeois “mass” intoxication? It was this
fusion of the masses, proletarian and non-proletarian,
regardless of class differences within the masses, that formed
one of the conditions for the defencist epidemic. To speak
contemptuously of a “group of propagandists” advocating a
proletarian line does not seem to be very
becoming.

["THESE PEOPLE" ?!?!  WHERE DOES THIS NOTE COME ?]

These people and the  SR party 
believed in supporting bourgeois governments as the sucessor to
tsarism. Following the establishment of bourgeois government, they
believed they would then organise the workers to form a Socialist
government. They were in support of the Russian Provisional
government of 1917, and after the Bolshevik revolution restarted
their terrorist tactics, now against the Bolshevik government,
with the hope of brining back a bourgeois government to rule
Russia, in order so that they could replace it in due time with a
“true” workers’ government.

Lest my words be misinterpreted, I
shall say at once that I am positively in favour of the
Soviets of Agricultural Labourers and Peasants
immediately taking over all the land; but they
should themselves observe the strictest order and
discipline, not permit the slightest dam age to machines,
structures, or livestock, and in no case disorganise agriculture
and grain production, but rather develop them, for the
soldiers need twice as much bread, and the people must
not be allowed to starve.  —Lenin

## Class Character of the
  Revolution









Lenin: 1917/tasks: THE CLASS CHARACTER OF THE REVOLUTLON THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    

 


The moment of history through which Russia is now passing is
marked by the following main characteristics:

    


THE CLASS CHARACTER OF THE REVOLUTLON THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE


1. The old tsarist power, which represented only a handful of
feudalist landowners who commanded the entire state machinery
(the army, the police, and the bureaucracy), has been
overthrown and removed, but not completely destroyed. The
monarchy has not been formally abolished; the Romanov gang
continues to hatch monarchist intrigues. The vast landed
possessions of the feudalist squirearchy have not been
abolished.


2. State power in Russia has passed into the hands of a new
class, namely, the bourgeoisie and landowners who
had become bourgeois. To this extent the
bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia is completed.


Having come to power, the bourgeoisie has formed a bloc (an
alliance) with the overt monarchists, who are notorious for
their exceptionally ardent support of Nicholas the Bloody and
Stolypin the Hangman in 1906-14 (Guchkov and other politicians
to the right of the
Cadets[1]).
The new bourgeois government of Lvov and Co. has attempted and
has begun to negotiate with the Romanovs for the restoration of
the monarchy in Russia. Behind a screen of revolutionary
phrases, this government is appointing partisans of the old
regime to key positions. It is striving to reform the whole
machinery of state (the army, the police, and the bureaucracy)
as little as possible, and has turned it over to the
bourgeoisie. The new government has already begun to hinder

    

in
every way the revolutionary initiative of mass action and the
seizure of power by the people from below, which is the
soleguarantee of the real success of the revolution.


Up to now this government has not even fixed a date for the
convocation of the Constituent Assembly. It is not laying a
finger on the landed estates, which form the material foundation
of feudal tsarism. This government does not even contemplate
starting an investigation into, and making public, the
activities of the monopolist financial organisations, the big
banks, the syndicates and cartels of the capitalists, etc., or
instituting control over them.


The key positions, the decisive ministerial posts in the new
government (the Ministry of the Interior and the War Ministry,
i.e., the command over the army, the police, the bureaucracy –
the entire apparatus for oppressing the people) are held by
outright monarchists and supporters of the system of big landed
estates. The Cadets, those day-old republicans, republicans
against their own will, have been assigned minor posts, having
no direct relation to the commandover the people or to
the apparatus of state power. A. Kerensky, a
Trudovik[2]
and “would-be socialist”, has no function whatsoever, except to
lull the vigilance and attention of the people with sonorous
phrases.


For all these reasons, the new bourgeois government does not
deserve the confidence of the proletariat even in the sphere of
internal policy, and no support of this government by the
proletariat is admissible.

## Foreign Policy of the New
  Government

V. I.  

      Lenin

(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT


3. In the field of foreign policy, which has now been brought to
the forefront by objective circumstances, the new government
is a government for the continuation of the imperialist war,
a war that is being waged in alliance with the imperialist
powers—Britain, France, and others—for division of the
capitalist spoils and for subjugating small and weak
nations. 

Subordinated to the interests of Russian capitalism and its
powerful protector and master—Anglo-French imperialist
capitalism, the wealthiest in the world, the new government,

    

notwithstanding the wishes expressed in no uncertain fashion on
behalf of the obvious majority of the peoples of Russia through
the Soviet of Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies, has taken no real
steps to put an end to the slaughter of peoples for the
interests of the capitalists. It has not even published the
secret treaties of an obviously predatory character (for the
partition of Persia, the plunder of China, the plunder of
Turkey, the partition of Austria, the annexation of Eastern
Prussia, the annexation of the German colonies, etc.), which, as
everybody knows, bind Russia to Anglo-French predatory
imperialist capital. It has confirmed these treaties
concluded by tsarism, which for centuries robbed and oppressed
more nations than other tyrants and despots, and which not only
oppressed, but also disgraced and demoralised the Great-Russian
nation by making it an executioner of other nations.


The new government has confirmed these shameful depredatory
treaties and has not proposed an immediate armistice to all the
belligerent nations, in spite of the clearly expressed demand of
the majority of the peoples of Russia, voiced through the
Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. It has evaded the
issue with the help of solemn, sonorous, bombastic, but
absolutely empty declarations and phrases, which, in the mouths
of bourgeois diplomats, have always served, and still serve, to
deceive the trustful and naïve masses of the oppressed
people.


4. Not only, therefore, is the new government unworthy of the
slightest confidence in the field of foreign policy, but to
go on demanding that it should proclaim the will of the
peoples of Russia for peace, that it should renounce
annexations, and so on and so forth, is in practice merely to
deceive the people, to inspire them with false hopes and to
retard the clarification of their minds. It is indirectly to
reconcile them to the continuation of a war the true social
character of which is determined not by pious wishes, but by
the class character of the government that wages the war, by
the connection between the class represented by this
government and the imperialist finance capital of Russia,
Britain, France, etc., by the real and actual
policywhich that class is pursuing.

## Peculair Nature of the Dual
  Power









Lenin: 1917/tasks: THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE DUAL POWER AND ITS CLASS SIGNIFICANCE







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE DUAL POWER

AND ITS CLASS SIGNIFICANCE


5. The main feature of our revolution, a feature that most
imperatively demands thoughtful consideration, is the
dual power which arose in the very first days after
the triumph of the revolution.


This dual power is evident in the existence of
twogovernments: one is the main, the real, the actual
government of the bourgeoisie, the “Provisional Government” of
Lvov and Co., which holds in its hands all the organs of power;
the other is a supplementary and parallel government, a
“controlling” government in the shape of the Petrograd Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which holds no organs of state
power, but directly rests on the support of an obvious and
indisputable majority of the people, on the armed workers and
soldiers.


The class origin and the class significance of this dual power
is the following: the Russian revolution of March 1917 not only
swept away the whole tsarist monarchy, not only transferred the
entire power to the bourgeoisie, but also moved close
towards a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry. The Petrograd and the other, the
local, Soviets constitute precisely such a dictatorship (that
is, a power resting not on the law but directly on the force of
armed masses of the population), a dictatorship precisely of the
above-mentioned classes.


6. The second highly important feature of the Russian revolution
is the fact that the Petrograd Soviet of Soldiers’ and
Workers’ Deputies, which, as everything goes to show, enjoys
the confidence of most of the local Soviets, is
voluntarilytransferring state power to the
bourgeoisie and itsProvisional Government, is
voluntarily cedingsupremacy to the latter, having
entered into an agreement to support it, and is limiting its
own role to that of an observer, a supervisor of the
convocation of the Constituent Assembly (the date for which
has not even been announced as yet by the Provisional
Government).


This remarkable feature, unparalleled in history in such a form,
has led to the interlocking of twodictatorships: the

    

dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (for the government of Lvov and
Co. is a dictatorship, i.e., a power based not on the law, not
on the previously expressed will of the people, but on seizure
by force, accomplished by a definite class, namely, the
bourgeoisie) and the dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry (the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies).


There is not the slightest doubt that such an “interlocking”
cannot last long. Two powers cannot existin a
state. One of them is bound to pass away; and the entire Russian
bourgeoisie is already trying its hardest everywhere and in
every way to keep out and weaken the Soviets, to reduce them to
nought, and to establish the undivided power of the
bourgeoisie.


The dual power merely expresses a transitionalphase in
the revolution’s development, when it has gone farther than the
ordinary bourgeois-democratic revolution, but has not yet
reacheda “pure” dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry.


The class significance (and the class explanation) of this
transitional and unstable situation is this: like all
revolutions, our revolution required the greatest heroism and
self-sacrifice on the part of the people for the struggle
against tsarism; it also immediately
drewunprecedentedly vast numbers of ordinary citizens
into the movement.


From the point of view of science and practical politics, one of
the chief symptoms of everyreal revolution is the
unusually rapid, sudden, and abrupt increase in the number of
“ordinary citizens” who begin to participate actively,
independently and effectively in political life and in the
organisation of the state.


Such is the case in Russia. Russia at present is
seething. Millions and tens of millions of people, who had been
politically dormant for ten years and politically crushed by the
terrible oppression of tsarism and by inhuman toil for the
landowners and capitalists, have awakened and taken
eagerlyto politics. And who are these millions and tens of
millions? For the most part small proprietors, petty bourgeois,
people standing midway between the capitalists and the
wage-workers Russia is the most petty-bourgeois of all European
countries.

 

A gigantic petty-bourgeois wave has swept over everything and
overwhelmed the class-conscious proletariat, not only by force
of numbers but also ideologically; that is, it has infected and
imbued very wide circles of workers with the petty-bourgeois
political outlook.


The petty bourgeoisie are in real life dependent upon the
bourgeoisie, for they live like masters and not like
proletarians (from the point of view of their placein
social production ) and follow the bourgeoisie in their
outlook.



An attitude of unreasoning trust in the capitalists—the worst
foes of peace and socialism—characterises the politics of the
popular massesin Russia at the present moment; this is
the fruit that has grownwith revolutionary rapidity on
the social and economic soil of the most petty-bourgeois of all
European countries. This is the classbasis for the
“agreement” between the Provisional Government and the
Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies (I emphasise that I am
referring not so much to the formal agreement as to actual
support, a tacit agreement, the surrender of power inspired
by unreasoning trust), an agreement which has given the Guchkovs
a fat piece—real power—and the Soviet merely promises and
honours (for the time being), flattery, phrases, assurances, and
the bowings and scrapings of the Kerenskys.


On the other side we have the inadequate numerical strength of
the proletariat in Russia and its insufficient
class-consciousness and organisation.


All the Narodnik parties, including the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, have always been
petty-bourgeois. This is also true of the party of the
Organising Committee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.). The non-party
revolutionaries (Steklov and others) have similarly yielded to
the tide, or have not been able to stand up to it, have not had
the time to do it.

## Peculiar Nature of the
  Tactics









Lenin: 1917/tasks: THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE TACTICS WHICH FOLLOW  THE ABOVE







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE TACTICS

WHICH FOLLOW  THE ABOVE


7. For the Marxist, who must reckon with objective facts, with
the masses and classes, and not with individuals and so on,
the peculiar nature of the actual situation as

    

described
above must determine the peculiar nature of the tactics for
the present moment.


This peculiarity of the situation calls, in the first place, for
the “pouring of vinegar and bile into the sweet water of
revolutionary-democratic phraseology” (as my fellow member on
the Central Committee of our Party, Teodorovich, so aptly put it
at yesterday’s session of the All-Russia Congress of Railwaymen
in Petrograd). Our work must be one of criticism, of
explainingthe mistakes of the petty-bourgeois
Socialist-Revolutionary and Social-Democratic parties, of
preparing and welding the elements of a
consciouslyproletarian, Communist Party, and of
curingthe proletariat of the “general” petty-bourgeois
intoxication.



This seemsto be “nothing more” than propaganda work,
but in reality it is most practical revolutionarywork;
for there is no advancing a revolution that has come to a
standstill, that has choked itself with phrases, and that keeps
“marking time”, not because of external obstacles,
not because of the violence of the bourgeoisie (Guchkov
is still only threatening to employ violence against the soldier
mass), but becauseof the unreasoning trust of the
people.


Only by overcoming this unreasoning trust (and we can and should
overcome it only ideologically, by comradely persuasion, by
pointing to the lessons of experience ) can we set
ourselves free from the prevailing orgy of revolutionary
phrase-mongeringand really stimulate the consciousness both
of the proletariat and of the mass in general, as well as their
bold and determined initiative in the localities– the
independent realisation, development and consolidation of
liberties, democracy, and the principle of people’s ownership of
all the land.


8. The world-wide experience of bourgeois and landowner
governments has evolved twomethods of keeping the
people in subjection. The first is violence. Nicholas Romanov
I, nicknamed Nicholas of the Big Stick, and Nicholas II, the
Bloody, demonstrated to the Russian people the maximum of
what can and cannot he done in the way of these hangmen’s
practices. But there is another method, best developed by the
British and French bourgeoisie, who “learned their lesson” in
a series of great revolutions and revolutionary movements of
the masses. It is the method of deception,

    

flattery, fine
phrases, promises by the million, petty sops, and concessions
of the unessential while retaining the essential.


The peculiar feature of the present situation in Russia is the
transition at a dizzy speed from the first method to the second,
from violent oppression of the people to flatteringand
deceiving the people by promises. Vaska the Cat listens, but
goes on
eating.[1] Milyukov and Guchkov are holding power,
they are protecting the profits of the capitalists, conducting
an imperialist war in the interests of Russian and Anglo-French
capital, and trying to get away with promises, declamation and
bombastic statements in reply to the speeches of “cooks” like
Chkheidze, Tsereteli and Steklov, who threaten, exhort, conjure,
beseech, demand and proclaim. . . . Vaska the Cat listens, but
goes on eating.


But from day to day trustful lack of reasoning and unreasoning
trust will be falling away, especially among the proletarians
and poorpeasants, who are being taught by experience
(by their social and economic position) to distrust the
capitalists.


The leaders of the petty bourgeoisie “must” teach the people to
trust the bourgeoisie. The proletarians must teach the people to
distrust the bourgeoisie.

REVOLUTIONARY DEFENCISM

AND ITS CLASS SIGNIFICANCE 

9. Revolutionary defencismmust be regarded as the most
important, the most striking manifestation of the
petty-bourgeois wave that has swept over “nearly
everything”. It is the worst enemy of the further progress
and success of the Russian revolution.


Those who have yielded on this point and have been unable to
extricate themselves are lost to the revolution. But the masses
yield in a different way from the leaders, and they extricate
themselves differently, by a different course of
development, by different means.





Revolutionary defencism is, on the one hand, a result of the
deception of the masses by the bourgeoisie, a result of the
trustful lack of reasoning on the part of the peasants


    

and a
section of the workers; it is, on the other, an expression of
the interests and point of view of the small proprietor, who is
to some extent interested in annexations and bank profits, and
who “sacredly” guards the traditions of tsarism, which
demoralised the Great Russians by making them do a hangman’s
work against the other peoples.


The bourgeoisie deceives the people by working on their noble
pride in the revolution and by pretending that the social
and politicalcharacter of the war, as far as Russia is
concerned, underwent a change because of this stage of the
revolution, because of the substitution of the near republic of
Guchkov and Milyukov for the tsarist monarchy. And the people
believed it—for a time—largely owing to age-old
prejudices, which made them look upon the other peoples of
Russia, i.e., the non-Great Russians, as something in the nature
of a property and private estate of the Great Russians. This
vile demoralisation of the Great Russian people by tsarism which
taught them to regard the other peoples as something inferior,
something belonging “by right” to Great Russia, could not
disappear instantly.


What is required of us is the abilityto explain to the
masses that the social and political character of the war is
determined not by the “good will” of individuals or groups, or
even of nations, but by the position of the classwhich
conducts the war, by the class policyof which the war
is a continuation, by the tiesof capital, which is the
dominant economic force in modern society, by the
imperialist characterof international capital, by
Russia’s dependence in finance, banking and diplomacy upon
Britain, France, and so on. To explain this skilfully in a way
the people would understand is not easy ; none of us
would be able to do it at once without committing errors.


But this, and only this, must be the aim or, rather, the message
of our propaganda. The slightest concession to revolutionary
defencism is a betrayal of socialism, a complete
renunciation of internationalism, no matter by what
fine phrases and “practical” considerations it may be
justified.


The slogan “Down with the War!” is, of course, correct. But it
fails to take into account the specific nature of the tasks of
the present moment and the necessity of approaching
    

the
broad mass of the people in a different way. It reminds
me of the slogan “Down with the Tsar!” with which the
inexperienced agitator of the “good old days” went simply and
directly to the countryside—and got a beating for his
pains. The mass believers in revolutionary defencism are
honest, not in the personal, but in the class sense,
i.e., they belong to classes(workers and the peasant
poor) which in actual facthave nothing to gain from
annexations and the subjugation of other peoples. This is
nothing like the bourgeois and the “intellectual” fraternity,
who know very well that you cannotrenounce annexations
without renouncing the rule of capital, and who unscrupulously
deceive the people with fine phrases, with unlimited promises
and endless assurances.


The rank-and-file believer in defencism regards the matter in
the simple way of the man in the street: “I don’t want
annexations, but the Germans are ’going for’ me,
therefore I’m defending a just cause and not any kind of
imperialist interests at all.” To a man like this it must be
explained again and again that it is not a question of his
personal wishes, but of mass, class, political
relations and conditions, of the connection between the war and
the interests of capital and the international network of banks,
and so forth. Only such a struggle against defencism will be
serious and will promise success—perhaps not a very rapid
success, but one that will be real and enduring.

V. I.  

      Lenin

(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


HOW CAN THE WAR BE ENDED?


10. The war cannot be ended “at will”. It cannot be ended by the
decision of one of the belligerents. It cannot be ended by
“sticking your bayonet into the ground”, as one soldier, a
defencist, expressed it.


The war cannot be ended by an “agreement” among the socialists
of the various countries, by the “action” of the proletarians of
all countries, by the “will” of the peoples, and so forth. All
the phrases of this kind, which fill the articles of the
defencist, semi-defencist, and semi-internationalist papers as
well as innumerable resolutions, appeals, manifestos, and the
resolutions of the Soviet of Soldiers’

    

and Workers’ Deputies –
all such phrases are nothing but idle, innocent and pious wishes
of the petty bourgeois. There is nothing more harmful than
phrases like “ascertaining the will of the peoples for peace”,
like the sequenceof revolutionary actions of the
proletariat (after the Russian proletariat comes the turn of the
German), etc. All this is Blancism, fond dreams, a playing at
“political campaigning”, and in reality just a repetition of the
fable of Vaska the Cat.


The war is not a product of the evil will of rapacious
capitalists, although it is undoubtedly being fought
onlyin their interests and they alone are being
enriched by it. The war is a product of half a century of
development of world capitalism and of its billions of threads
and connections. It is impossibleto slip out of the
imperialist war and achieve a democratic, non-coercive peace
without overthrowing the power of capital and transferring state
power to anotherclass, the proletariat.


The Russian revolution of February-March 1917 was the beginning
of the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil
war. This revolution took the firststep towards ending
the war; but it requires a secondstep, namely, the
transfer of state power to the proletariat, to make the end of
the war a certainty. This will be the beginning of a
“break-through” on a world-wide scale, a break-through in the
front of capitalist interests; and only by breaking through
thisfront canthe proletariat save mankind from
the horrors of war and endow it with the blessings of peace.


It is directly to such a “break-through” in the front of
capitalism that the Russian revolution has
alreadybrought the Russian proletariat by creating the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies.

## New Type of State









Lenin: 1917/tasks: A NEW TYPE OF STATE EMERGING  OUR REVOLUTION







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


A NEW TYPE OF STATE

EMERGING  OUR REVOLUTION


11. The Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’ and other
Deputies are not understood, not only in the sense that
their class significance, their role in the
Russianrevolution, is not clear to the
majority. They are not understood also in the sense that
they constitute a new form or rather a new type of
state.

 

The most perfect, the most advanced type of bourgeois state is
the parliamentary democratic republic: power is vested
in parliament; the state machine, the apparatus and organ of
administration, is of the customary kind: the standing army, the
police, and the bureaucracy—which in practice is
undisplaceable, is privileged and stands abovethe
people.


Since the end of the nineteenth century, however, revolutionary
epochs have advanced a highertype of democratic state,
a state which in certain respects, as Engels put it, ceases to
be a state, is “no longer a state in the proper sense of the
word”.[1] This is a state of the Paris Commune type, one in which a
standing army and police divorced from the people are
replacedby the direct arming of the people
themselves. It is this featurethat constitutes the very
essence of the Commune, which has been so misrepresented and
slandered by the bourgeois writers, and to which has been
erroneously ascribed, among other things, the intention of
immediately “introducing” socialism.


This is the type of state which the Russian revolution
beganto create in 1905 and in 1917. A Republic of
Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other Deputies,
united in an All-Russia Constituent Assembly of people’s
representatives or in a Council of Soviets, etc., is what is
already being realisedin our country now, at this
juncture. It is being realised by the initiative of the nation’s
millions, who are creating a democracy on their own, in
their own waywithout waiting until the Cadet professors
draft their legislative bills for a parliamentary bourgeois
republic, or until the pedants and routine-worshippers of
petty-bourgeois “Social-Democracy”, like Mr. Plekhanov or
Kautsky, stop distorting the Marxist teaching on the state.


Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises the
needfor a state and for state power in the period of
revolution in general, and in the period of transition from
capitalism to socialism in particular.


Marxism differs from the petty-bourgeois, opportunist
“Social-Democratism” of Plekhanov, Kautsky and Co. in that it
recognises that what is required during these two periods is
nota state of the usual parliamentary bourgeois
republican type, but a state of the Paris Commune type.

 

The main distinctions between a state of the latter type and the
old state are as follows.


It is quite easy (as history proves) to revert from a
parliamentary bourgeois republic to a monarchy, for all the
machinery of oppression—the army, the police, and the
bureaucracy—is left intact. The Commune and the Soviet
smashthat machinery and do away with it.


The parliamentary bourgeois republic hampers and stifles the
independent political life of the massestheir direct
participation in the democraticorganisation of the life
of the state from the bottom up. The opposite is the case with
the Soviets.


The latter reproduce the type of state which was being evolved
by the Paris Commune and which Marx described as “the political
form at last discovered under which to work out the economic
emancipation of
labour”.[2]


We are usually told that the Russian people are not yet prepared
for the “introduction” of the Commune. This was the argument of
the serf-owners when they claimed that the peasants were not
prepared for emancipation. The Commune, i.e., the Soviets, does
not “introduce”, does not intend to “introduce”, and must not
introduce anyreforms which have not absolutely matured
both in economic reality and in the minds of the overwhelming
majority of the people. The deeper the economic collapse and the
crisis produced by the war, the more urgent becomes the need for
the most perfect political form, which will
facilitatethe healing of the terrible wounds inflicted
on mankind by the war. The less the organisational experience of
the Russian people, the more resolutely must we
proceedto organisational development by the people
themselvesand not merely by the bourgeois politicians and
“well-placed” bureaucrats.


The sooner we shed the old prejudices of pseudo-Marxism, a
Marxism falsified by Plekhanov, Kautsky and Co., the more
actively we set about helping the people to organise Soviets of
Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies everywhere and immediately, and
helping the latter to take life in its entiretyunder
their control, and the longer Lvov and Co. delay the convocation
of the Constituent Assembly, the easier will it be for the
people (through the medium of the Constituent

    

Assembly, or
independently of it, if Lvov delays its convocation too long) to
cast their decision in favour of a republic of Soviets of
Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. Errors in the new work of
organisational development by the people themselves are at first
inevitable; but it is better to make mistakes and go forward
than to waituntil the professors of law summoned by
Mr. Lvov draft their laws for the convocation of the Constituent
Assembly, for the perpetuation of the parliamentary bourgeois
republic and for the strangling of the Soviets of Workers’ and
Peasants’ Deputies.


If we organise ourselves and conduct our propaganda skilfully,
not only the proletarians, but nine-tenths of the peasants will
be opposed to the restoration of the police, will be opposed to
an undisplaceable and privileged bureaucracy and to an army
divorced from the people. And that is all the new type of state
stands for.


12. The substitution of a people’s militia for the police is a
reform that follows from the entire course of the revolution
and that is now being introduced in most parts of Russia. We
must explain to the people that in most of the bourgeois
revolutions of the usual type, this reform was always
extremely short-lived, and that the bourgeoisie—even the
most democratic and republican—restored the police of the
old, tsarist type, a police divorced from the people,
commanded by the bourgeoisie and capable of oppressing the
people in every way.


There is only one way to preventthe restoration of the
police, and that is to create a people’s militia and to fuse it
with the army (the standing army to be replaced by the arming of
the entire people). Service in this militia should extend to all
citizens of both sexes between the ages of fifteen and
sixty-five without exception, if these tentatively suggested age
limits may be taken as indicating the participation of
adolescents and old people. Capitalists must pay their workers,
servants, etc., for days devoted to public service in the
militia. Unless women are brought to take an independent part
not only in political life generally, but also in daily and
universal public service, it is no use talking about full and
stable democracy, let alone socialism. And such “police”
functions as care of the sick and of

    

homeless children, food
inspection, etc., will never be satisfactorily discharged until
women are on an equal footing with men, not merely nominally but
in reality.


The tasks which the proletariat must put before the people in
order to safeguard, consolidate and develop the revolution are
prevention of the restoration of the police and enlistment of
the organisational forces of the entire people in forming a
people’s militia.

  Programmes









Lenin: 1917/tasks: THE AGRARIAN AND NATIONAL PROGRAMMES







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE AGRARIAN AND NATIONAL PROGRAMMES


13. At the present moment we cannot say for certain whether a
mighty agrarian revolution will develop in the Russian
countryside in the near future. We cannot say exactly how
profound the class cleavage is among the peasants, which has
undoubtedly grown more profound of late as a division into
agricultural labourers, wage-workers and poor peasants
(“semi-proletarians”), on the one hand, and wealthy and
middle peasants (capitalists and petty capitalists), on the
other. Such questions will be, and can be, decided only by
experience.


Being the party of the proletariat, however, we are
unquestionably in duty bound not only immediately to advance an
agrarian (land) programme but also to advocate practical
measures which can be immediately realised in the
interestsof the peasant agrarian revolution in Russia.


We must demand the nationalisation of allthe land,
i.e., that all the land in the state should become the property
of the central state power. This power must fix the size, etc.,
of the resettlement land fund, pass legislation for the
conservation of forests, for land improvement, etc., and
absolutely prohibit any middlemen to interpose themselves
between the owner of the land, i.e., the state, and the tenant,
i.e., the tiller (prohibit all subletting of land). However, the
disposalof the land, the determination of the local
regulationsgoverning ownership and tenure of land, must in
no case be placed in the hands of bureaucrats and officials, but
wholly and exclusively in the hands of the regional and local
Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies.

 

In order to improve grain production techniques and increase
output, and in order to develop rational cultivation on a large
scale under public control, we must strive within the peasants’
committees to secure the transformation of every confiscated
landed estate into a large model farm controlled by the
Soviet of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.


In order to counteract the petty-bourgeois phrase-mongering and
the policy prevailing among the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
particularly the idle talk about “subsistence” standards or
“labour” standards, “socialisation of the land”, etc., the party
of the proletariat must make it clear that small-scale farming
under commodity production cannot save mankind from poverty and
oppression.


Without necessarily splitting the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies
at once, the party of the proletariat must explain the need for
organising separate Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies
and separate Soviets of deputies from the poor
(semi-proletarian) peasants, or, at least, for holding regular
separate conferences of deputies of this class statusin
the shape of separate groups or parties within the general
Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. Otherwise all the honeyed
petty-bourgeois talk of the
Narodniks[1] regarding the peasants in
general will serve as a shield for the deception of the
propertyless mass by the wealthy peasants, who are merely a
variety of capitalists.


To counteract the bourgeois-liberal or purely bureaucratic
sermons preached by many Socialist-Revolutionaries and Soviets
of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, who advise the peasants not
to seize the landed estates and not to start the agrarian reform
pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, the party
of the proletariat must urge the peasants to carry out the
agrarian reform at once on their own, and to confiscate the
landed estates immediately, upon the decisions of the peasants’
deputies in the localities.


At the same time, it is most important to insist on the
necessity of increasingfood production for the soldiers
at the front and for the towns, and on the absolute
inadmissibility of causing any damage or injury to livestock,
implements, machinery, buildings, etc.

 

14. As regards the national question, the proletarian party
first of all must advocate the proclamation and immediate
realisation of complete freedom of secession from Russia for
all the nations and peoples who were oppressed by tsarism,
or who were forcibly joined to, or forcibly kept within the
boundaries of, the state, i.e., annexed.


All statements, declarations and manifestos concerning
renunciation of annexations that are not accompanied by the
realisation of the right of secession in practice, are nothing
but bourgeois deception of the people, or else pious
petty-bourgeois wishes.


The proletarian party strives to create as large a state as
possible, for this is to the advantage of the working people; it
strives to drawnations closer together, and
bring about their further fusion; but it desires to
achieve this aim not by violence, but exclusively through a free
fraternal union of the workers and the working people of all
nations.


The more democratic the Russian republic, and the more
successfully it organises itself into a Republic of Soviets of
Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, the more powerful will be the
force of voluntaryattraction to such a republic on the
part of the working people of allnations.


Complete freedom of secession, the broadest local (and national)
autonomy, and elaborate guarantees of the rights of national
minorities—this is the programme of the revolutionary
proletariat.

NATIONALISATION OF THE BANKS

AND CAPITALIST SYNDICATES


15. Under no circumstances can the party of the proletariat set
itself the aim of “introducing” socialism in a country of
small peasants so long as the overwhelming majority of the
population has not come to realise the need for a socialist
revolution.


But only bourgeois sophists, hiding behind “near-Marxist”
catchwords, can deduce from this truth a justification of the
policy of postponing immediate revolutionary measures, the time
for which is fully ripe; measures which

    

have
beenfrequently resorted to during the war by a number
of bourgeois states, and which are absolutely indispensable
in order to combat impending total economic disorganisation and
famine.


Such measures as the nationalisation of the land, of all the
banks and capitalist syndicates, or, at least, the
immediateestablishment of the control

of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, etc., over them—measures which
do not in any way constitute the “introduction” of socialism—must
be absolutely insisted on, and, whenever possible, carried out in a
revolutionary way. Without such measures, which are only steps towards
socialism, and which are perfectly feasible economically, it will be
impossible to heal the wounds caused by the war and to avert the
impending collapse; and the party of the revolutionary proletariat
will never hesitate to lay hands on the fabulous profits of the
capitalists and bankers, who are enriching themselves on the war in a
particularly scandalous manner.

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE SITUATION

WITHIN THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL


16. The international obligations of the working class of Russia
are precisely now coming to the forefront with particular
force.


Only lazy people do not swear by internationalism these
days. Even the chauvinist defencists, even Plekhanov and
Potresov, even Kerensky, call themselves internationalists. It
becomes the duty of the proletarian party all the more urgently,
therefore, to clearly, precisely and definitely counterpoise
internationalism in deed to internationalism in word.


Mere appeals to the workers of all countries, empty assurances
of devotion to internationalism, direct or indirect attempts to
fix a “sequence” of action by the revolutionary proletariat in
the various belligerent countries, laborious efforts to conclude
“agreements” between the socialists of the belligerent countries
on the questionof the revolutionary struggle, all the
fuss over the summoning of socialist congresses for the
purposeof a peace campaign, etc., etc.—no

    

matter how
sincere the authors of such ideas, attempts, and plans may be –
amount, as far as their objectivesignificance is
concerned, to mere phrase-mongering, and at bestare
innocent and pious wishes, fit only to conceal the
deceptionof the people by the chauvinists. The
Frenchsocial-chauvinists, who are the most adroit and
accomplished in methods of parliamentary hocus-pocus, have long
since broken the record for ranting and resonant pacifist and
internationalist phrases coupled withthe incredibly
brazen betrayal of socialism and the International, the
acceptance of posts in governments which conduct the imperialist
war, the voting of credits or loans(as Chkheidze,
Skobelev, Tsereteli and Steklov have been doing recently in
Russia), opposition to the revolutionary struggle in their
own country, etc., etc.


Good people often forget the brutal and savage setting of the
imperialist world war. This setting does not tolerate phrases,
and mocks at innocent and pious wishes.


There is one, and only one, kind of real internationalism, and
that is—working whole-heartedly for the development of the
revolutionary movement and the revolutionary struggle in
one’s owncountry, and supporting (by propaganda,
sympathy, and material aid) this struggle, this, and
only this, line, in everycountry without
exception.


Everything else is deception and
Manilovism.[1]


During the two odd years of the war the international socialist
and working-class movement in everycountry has evolved
three trends. Whoever ignores realityand refuses to
recognise the existence of these three trends, to analyse them,
to fight consistently for the trend that is really
internationalist, is doomed to impotence, helplessness and
errors.


The three trends are:


1). The social-chauvinists,
i.e., socialists in word and chauvinists in deed. People who
support “defence of the fatherland” in an imperialist war (and
above all in the present imperialist war).


These people are our class enemies. They have gone over
to the bourgeoisie.


They are the majority of the official leaders of the official
Social-Democratic parties in all countries—Plekhanov
    

and Co. in Russia, the Scheidemanns in Germany, Renaudel, Guesde
and Sembat in France, Bissolati and Co. in Italy, Hyndman, the
Fabians[2]
and the Labourites (the leaders of the “Labour Party”) in
Britain, Branting and Co. in Sweden, Troelstra and his party in
Holland, Stauning and his party in Denmark, Victor Berger and
the other “defenders of the fatherland” in America, and so
forth.


2) The second trend, known as the “Centre”, consists of people
who vacillate between the social-chauvinists and the true
internationalists.


The “Centre” all vow and declare that they are Marxists and
internationalists, that they are for peace, for bringing every
kind of “pressure” to bear upon the governments, for “demanding”
in every way that their own government should “ascertain the
will of the people for peace”, that they are for all sorts of
peace campaigns, for peace without annexations, etc., etc. –
and for peace with the social-chauvinists. The “Centre”
is for “unity”, the Centre is opposed to a split.


The “Centre” is a realm of honeyed petty-bourgeois phrases, of
internationalism in word and cowardly opportunism and fawning on
the social-chauvinists in deed.


The crux of the matter is that the “Centre” is not convinced of
the necessity for a revolution against one’s own government; it
does not preach revolution; it does not carry on a whole-hearted
revolutionary struggle; and in order to evade such a struggle it
resorts to the tritest ultra-“Marxist”-sounding
excuses. 

The social-chauvinists are our class enemies,  they are
bourgeois within the working-class movement. They
represent a stratum, or groups, or sections of the working class
which objectively have been bribed by the bourgeoisie
(by better wages, positions of honour, etc.), and which help
their own bourgeoisie to plunder and oppress small and
weak peoples and to fight for the division of the
capitalist spoils.


The “Centre” consists of routine-worshippers, eroded by the
canker of legality, corrupted by the parliamentary atmosphere,
etc., bureaucrats accustomed to snug positions and soft
jobs. Historically and economically speaking, they are not a
separate stratum but represent only a
transition from a past phase of the working-class
movement—the phase

    

between 1871 and 1914, which gave much
that is valuable to the proletariat, particularly in the
indispensable art of slow, sustained and systematic
organisational work on a large and very large scale—to a new
phase that became objectively essential with
the outbreak of the first imperialist world war, which
inaugurated the era of social revolution. 

The chief leader and spokesman of the “Centre” is Karl
Kautsky, the most outstanding authority in the Second
International (1889–1914), since August 1914 a model of utter
bankruptcy as a Marxist, the embodiment of unheard-of
spinelessness, and the most wretched vacillations and
betrayals. This “Centrist” trend includes Kautsky, Haase,
Ledebour and the so-called workers’
or labour
group[3] in the Reichstag; in France it includes
Longuet, Pressemane and the so-called

minorities[4]
(Mensheviks) in general; in Britain, Philip Snowden, Ramsay
MacDonald and many other leaders of the Independent
Labour
Party,[5] and some leaders of the British
Socialist
Party[6]; Morris Hillquit and many others in the
United States; Turati, Tréves, Modigliani and others in
Italy; Robert Grimm and others in Switzerland; Victor Adler and
Co. in Austria; the party of the Organising Committee, Axelrod,
Martov, Chkheidze, Tsereteli and others in Russia, and so
forth.


Naturally, at times individuals unconsciously drift from the
social-chauvinist to the “Centrist” position, and vice
versa. Every Marxist knows that classes are distinct, even
though individuals may move freely from one class to another;
similarly, trends in political life are distinct in
spite of the fact that individuals may change freely from one
trend to another, and in spite of all attempts and efforts to
amalgamate trends.



3) The third trend, that of the true internationalists, is best
represented by the “Zimmerwald
Left”.[7] (We reprint as a supplement its manifesto of
September 1915, to enable the reader to learn of the
inception of this trend at first hand.)


Its distinctive feature is its complete break with both
social-chauvinism and “Centrism”, and its gallant revolutionary
struggle against its own imperialist government and
its own imperialist bourgeoisie. Its principle is: “Our
chief enemy is at home.” It wages a ruthless struggle against

    

honeyed social-pacifist phrases (a social-pacifist is a
socialist in word and a bourgeois pacifist in deed; bourgeois
pacifists dream of an everlasting peace without the
overthrow of the yoke and domination of capital) and against all
subterfuges employed to deny the possibility, or the
appropriateness, or the timeliness of a proletarian
revolutionary struggle and of a proletarian socialist revolution
in connection with the present war.


The most outstanding representative of this trend in Germany is
the Spartacus
group or the Internationale
group,[8] to which Karl
Liebknecht belongs. Karl Liebknecht is a most celebrated
representative of this trend and of the new,  and
genuine, proletarian International.


Karl Liebknecht called upon the workers and soldiers of Germany
to turn their guns against their own
government. Karl Liebknecht did that openly from the rostrum of
parliament (the Reichstag). He then went to a demonstration in
Potsdamer Platz, one of the largest public squares in Berlin,
with illegally printed leaflets proclaiming the slogan “Down
with the Government!” He was arrested and sentenced to hard
labour . He is now serving his term in a German convict
prison, like hundreds,  if not thousands, of other
true German socialists who have been imprisoned for
their anti-war activities.


Karl Liebknecht in his speeches and letters mercilessly attacked
not only his own Plekhanovs and Potresovs
(Scheidemanns, Legiens, Davids and Co.), but also his own
Centrists,  his own Chkheidzes and Tseretelis (Kautsky,
Haase, Ledebour and Co.).


Karl Liebknecht and his friend Otto Rühle, two out of one
hundred and ten deputies, violated discipline, destroyed the
“unity” with the “Centre” and the chauvinists, and went
against all of them . Liebknecht alone represents
socialism, the proletarian cause, the proletarian
revolution. All the rest of German Social-Democracy, to quote
the apt words of Rosa Luxemburg (also a member and one of the
leaders of the Spartacus group), is a “stinking corpse”.


Another group of true internationalists in Germany is that of
the Bremen paper Arbeiterpolitik. 

Closest to the internationalists in deed are: in France, Loriot
and his friends (Bourderon and Merrheim have

    

slid down to
social-pacifism), as well as the Frenchman Henri Guilbeaux, who
publishes in Geneva the journal Demain  ; in Britain,
the newspaper The Trade Unionist,  and some of the
members of the British Socialist Party and of the Independent
Labour Party (for instance, Russel Williams, who openly called
for a break with the leaders who have betrayed
socialism), the Scottish socialist school teacher
MacLean,  who was sentenced to hard labour by
the bourgeois government of Britain for his revolutionary fight
against the war, and hundreds of British socialists who are in
jail for the same offence. They, and they alone, are
internationalists in deed. In the United States, the Socialist
Labour
Party[9] and those within the opportunist Socialist
Party[10] who in January 1917 began publication of the paper,
The Internationalist  ; in Holland, the Party of the
“Tribunists”[11]
which publishes the paper De Tribune (Pannekoek, Herman
Gorter, Wijnkoop, and Henriette Roland-Holst, who, although
Centrist at Zimmerwald, has now joined our ranks); in Sweden,
the Party of the Young, or the
Left[Swedish
Social Democrats],[12] led by Lindhagen, Ture Nerman, Carleson,
Strölm and Z. Hömlglund, who at Zimmerwald was
personally active in the organisation of the “Zimmerwald Left”,
and who is now in prison for his revolutionary fight against the
war; in Denmark, Trier and his friends who have left the now
purely bourgeois “Social-Democratic” Party of Denmark,
headed by the Minister Stauning; in Bulgaria, the
“Tesnyaki”[13];
in Italy, the nearest are Constantino Lazzari, secretary of the
party, and Serrati, editor of the central organ,
Avanti![14];
in Poland, Radek, Hanecki and other leaders of the
Social-Democrats united under the “Regional Executive”, and Rosa
Luxemburg, Tyszka and other leaders of the Social-Democrats
united under the “Chief Executive”[executive bodies of the Social democrats in the
Kingdom of Poland and Lithuana][15]; in Switzerland, those of
the Left who drew up the argument for the “referendum” (January
1917) in order to fight the social-chauvinists and the “Centre”
in their own country and who at the Zurich Cantonal
Socialist Convention, held at Töss on February 11, 1917,
moved a consistently revolutionary resolution against the war;
in Austria, the young Left-wing friends of Friedrich Adler, who
acted partly through the Karl Marx Club in Vienna, now closed by
the arch-reactionary Austrian Government, which is ruining

    

Adler’s life for his heroic though ill-considered shooting at a
minister, and so on.


It is not a question of shades of opinion, which certainly exist
even among the Lefts. It is a question of trend . The
thing is that it is not easy to be an internationalist in deed
during a terrible imperialist war. Such people are few; but it
is on such people
alone that the future of socialism depends; they
 alone are the leaders of the people,  and not
their corrupters.


The distinction between the reformists and the revolutionaries,
among the Social-Democrats, and socialists generally, was
objectively bound to undergo a change under the conditions of
the imperialist war. Those who confine themselves to “demanding”
that the bourgeois governments should conclude peace or
“ascertain the will of the peoples for peace”, etc., are
actually slipping into reforms. For, objectively,  
the problem of the war can be solved only in a
revolutionary way.


There is no possibility of this war ending in a democratic,
non-coercive peace or of the people being relieved of the burden
of  billions paid in interest to the capitalists, who
have made fortunes out of the war, except through a revolution
of the proletariat.


The most varied reforms can and must be demanded of the
bourgeois governments, but one cannot, without sinking to
Manilovism and reformism, demand that people and classes
entangled by the thousands of threads of imperialist capital
should  tear those threads. And unless they are torn,
all talk of a war against war is idle and deceitful prattle.


The “Kautskyites”, the “Centre”, are revolutionaries in word and
reformists in deed, they are internationalists in word and
accomplices of the social-chauvinists in deed.

## Collapse of the Zimmerwald
  International









Lenin: 1917/tasks: THE COLLAPSE OF THE ZIMMERWALD INTERNATIONAL.— THE NEED FOR FOUNDING A THIRD INTERNATIONAL







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


THE COLLAPSE

OF THE ZIMMERWALD INTERNATIONAL.—

THE NEED FOR FOUNDING A THIRD INTERNATIONAL


17. From the very outset, the Zimmerwald International adopted a
vacillating, “Kautskyite”, “Centrist” position, which
immediately compelled the Zimmerwald Left to
dissociate itself, to separate itself from the rest, and to

    

issue its own manifesto (published in Switzerland
in Russian, German and French).


The chief shortcoming of the Zimmerwald International, and the
cause of its collapse (for politically and
ideologically it has already collapsed), was its vacillation and
indecision on such a momentous issue of crucial
practical significance as that of breaking completely with
social-chauvinism and the old social-chauvinist International,
headed by Vandervelde and Huysmans at The Hague (Holland), etc.


It is not as yet known in Russia that the Zinmerwald majority
are nothing but Kautskyites . Yet this is the fun
damental fact, one which cannot be ignored, and which is now
generally known in Western Europe. Even that chauvinist, that
extreme German chauvinist, Heilmann,editor of the
ultra-chauvinistic Chemnitzer
Volksstimme and contributor to Parvus’s ultra-chauvinistic
Glocke[1]
(a “Social-Democrat”, of course, and an ardent partisan of
Social-Democratic “unity”), was compelled to acknowledge in the
press that the Centre, or “Kautkyism”, and the Zimmerwald
majority were one and the same thing.


This fact was definitely established at the end of 1916 and the
beginning of 1917. Although social-pacifism was condemned by the
Kienthal
Manifesto,[2] the whole Zimmerwald Right,
the entire Zimmerwald majority, sank to
social-pacifism: Kautsky and Co. in a series of utterances in
January and February 1917; Bourderon and Merrheim in France, who
cast their votes in unanimity with the
social-chauvinists for the pacifist resolutions of the Socialist
Party (December 1916) and of the Confédération
Générale du Travail (the national organisation of the
French trade unions, also in December 1916); Turati and Co. in
Italy, where the entire party took up a social-pacifist
position, while Turati himself, in a speech delivered on
December 17, 1916, “slipped” (not by accident, of course) into
nationalist phrases whitewashing the imperialist war.


In January 1917, the chairman of the Zimmerwald and Kienthal
conferences, Robert Grimm, joined the social-chauvinists in
his own party (Greulich, Pflüger, Gustav
Mümller and others) against the internationalists
in deed.


At two conferences of Zimmerwaldists from various
countries in January and February 1917, this equivocal,
double-faced

    

behaviour of the Zimmerwald majority was formally
stigmatised by the Left internationalists of several countries:
by Munzenberg,secretary of the international youth organisation
and editor of the excellent internationalist publication Die
Jugendinternationale[3]; by Zinoviev, representative of
the Central Committee of our Party; by K. Radek of the Polish
Social-Democratic Party (the “Regional Executive”), and by
Hartstein, a German Social-Democrat and member of the Spartacus
group.


Much is given to the Russian proletariat; nowhere in the world
has the working class yet succeeded in developing so much
revolutionary energy as in Russia. But to whom much is given, of
him much is required.



The Zimmerwald bog can no longer be tolerated. We must not, for
the sake of the Zimmerwald “Kautskyites”, continue the
semi-alliance with the chauvinist International of the
Plekhanovs and Scheidemanns. We must break with this
International immediately. We must remain in Zimmerwald only for
purposes of information.


It is we who must found, and right now, without delay, a new,
revolutionary, proletarian International, or rather, we must not
fear to acknowledge publicly that this new International is
already established and operating.


This is the International of those “internationalists in deed”
whom I precisely listed above. They and they alone are
representatives of the revolutionary, internationalist mass, and
not their corrupters.


And if socialists of that type are few, let every
Russian worker ask himself whether there were many really
class-conscious revolutionaries in Russia on the eve of
the February-March revolution of 1917.


It is not a question of numbers, but of giving correct
expression to the ideas and policies of the truly revolutionary
proletariat. The thing is not to “proclaim” internationalism,
but to be able to be an internationalist in deed, even when
times are most trying.


Let us not deceive ourselves with hopes of agreements and
international congresses. As long as the imperialist war is on,
international intercourse is held in the iron vise of the
military dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie. If even
the “republican” Milyukov, who is obliged to

    

tolerate the
parallel government of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, did
not allow Fritz Platten,  the Swiss socialist, secretary of
the party, an internationalist and participant in the Zimmerwald
and Kienthal conferences, to enter Russia in April 1917, in
spite of the fact that Platten has a Russian wife and was on his
way to visit his wife’s relatives, and in spite of the fact that
he had taken part in the revolution of 1905 in Riga, for which
he had been confined in a Russian prison, had given bail to the
tsarist government for his release and wished to recover that
bail—if the “republican” Milyukov could do such a
thing in April 1917 in Russia, one can judge what value can be
put on the promises and assurances, the phrases and declarations
of the bourgeoisie on the subject of peace without annexations,
and soon.


And the arrest of Trotsky by the British Government? And the
refusal to allow Martov to leave Switzerland, and the attempt to
lure him to Britain, where Trotsky’s fate awaits him?


Let us harbour no illusions. We must not deceive ourselves.


To “wait” for international congresses or conferences is simply
to betray internationalism, since it has been shown
that even from Stockholm neither socialists loyal to
internationalism nor even their letters are allowed to
come here, although this is quite possible and although a
ferocious military censorship exists.


Our Party must not “wait”, but must immediately found a
Third International. Hundreds of socialists imprisoned in
Germany and Britain will then heave a sigh of relief, thousands
and thousands of German workers who are now holding strikes and
demonstrations that are frightening that scoundrel and brigand,
Wilhelm, will learn from illegal leaflets of our
decision, of our fraternal confidence in Karl Liebknecht, and in
him alone, of our decision to fight “revolutionary
defencism” even now  ; they will read this and be
strengthened in their revolutionary internationalism.


To whom much is given, of him much is required. No other country
in the world is as free as Russia is now . Let us make
use of this freedom, not to advocate support for the
bourgeoisie, or bourgeois “revolutionary defencism”, but in a
bold, honest, proletarian, Liebknecht way to

    

found the Third
International,  an International uncompromisingly hostile
both to the social-chauvinlst traitors and to the vacillating
“Centrists”.


18. After what has been said, there is no need to waste many
words explaining that the amalgamation of Social-Democrats
in Russia is out of the question.


It is better to remain with one friend only, like Liebknecht,
and that means remaining with the revolutionary
proletariat,  than to entertain even for a moment any
thought of amalgamation with the party of the Organising
Committee, with Chkheidze and Tsereteli, who can tolerate a bloc
with Potresov in Rabochaya Gazeta, who voted for the
loan in the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies,[4] and who have sunk to “defencism”.


Let the dead bury their dead.


Whoever wants to help the waverers must first stop
wavering himself.

resolution in favour of supporting the so-called “Liberty Loan”
issued by the Provisional Government to finance the continuing
imperialist war. The Bolshevik members of the Executive
Committee opposed this loan, declaring that support of it was
“the worst form of ‘civil truce’\thinspace” and moved a resolution
containing a detailed statement of their position. Several
members of the E.C. not belonging to the Bolshevik group voted
with the Bolsheviks. The question was put before the plenary
meeting of the Soviet after a preliminary discussion in the
groups.

## Name of Our
  Party









Lenin: 1917/tasks: WHAT SHOULD BE THE NAME OF OUR PARTY—ONE THAT WILL BE CORRECT SCIENTIFICALLY AND HELP TO CLARIFY THE MIND OF THE PROLETARIAT POLITICALLY?







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


WHAT SHOULD BE THE NAME OF OUR PARTY—ONE

THAT WILL BE CORRECT
SCIENTIFICALLY

AND HELP TO CLARIFY THE MIND

OF THE PROLETARIAT
POLITICALLY?


19. I now come to the final point, the name of our Party. We
must call ourselves the  Communist Party—just as
Marx and Engels called themselves.


We must repeat that we are Marxists and that we take as our
basis the  Communist Manifesto,  which has been
distorted and betrayed by the Social-Democrats on its two main
points:


(1) the working men have no country: “defence of the fatherland”
in an imperialist war is a betrayal of socialism; and
(2) the Marxist doctrine of the state has been distorted by
the Second International.


The name “Social-Democracy” is  scientifically
incorrect, as Marx frequently pointed out, in particular, in the
Critique
of the Gotha Programme in 1875, and as Engels re-affirmed in
a more popular form in
1894[Engels, Preface
to Internationales aus dem Velkstaat (1871-1875)].[1] From
capitalism mankind can pass directly only to socialism, i.e., to
the social ownership of the means of production and the
distribution of products according to the amount of work

    

performed by each individual. Our Party looks farther ahead:
socialism must inevitably evolve gradually into communism, upon
the banner of which is inscribed the motto, “From each according
to his ability, to each according to his needs”.


That is my first argument.


Here is the second: the second part of the name of our Party
(Social-Democrats) is also scientifically
incorrect. Democracy is a form of  state,  whereas we
Marxists are opposed to  every kind of state.


The leaders of the Second International (1889-1914), Plekhanov,
Kautsky and their like, have vulgarised and distorted Marxism.


Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises  the
need for a state for the purpose of the transition to
socialism; but (and here is where we differ from Kautsky and
Co.)  not a state of the type of the usual
parliamentary bourgeois-democratic republic, but a state like
the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies
of 1905 and 1917.


My third argument:  living reality,  the revolution,
has  already actually established in our colmtry,
albeit in a weak and embryonic form, precisely this new type of
“state”, which is not a state in the proper sense of the word.


This is  already a matter of the practical action of
the people, and not merely a theory of the leaders.


The state in the proper sense of the term is domination over the
people by contingents of armed men divorced from the people.


Our emergent,  new state is also a state, for we too
need contingents of armed men, we too need the
strictest order, and must  ruthlessly crush by
force all attempts at either a tsarist or a Guchkov-bourgeois
counter-revolution.


But our  emergent,  new state is  no longer a
state in the proper sense of the term, for in some parts of
Russia these contingents of armed men are  the masses
themselves,  the entire people, and not certain privileged
persons placed over the people, and divorced from the people,
and for all practical purposes undisplaceable.


We must look forward, and not backward to the usual bourgeois
type of democracy, which consolidated the rule of the
bourgeoisie with the aid of tho old,  monarchist
    

organs
of administration, the police, the army and the bureaucracy.


We must look forward to the emergent new democracy, which is
already ceasing to be a democracy, for democracy means the
domination of the people, and the armed people cannot dominate
themselves.


The term democracy is not only scientifically incorrect when
applied to a Communist Party; it has now, since March 1917,
simply become  blinders put on the eyes of the
revolutionary people and  preventing them from boldly
and freely, on their own initiative, building up the new: the
Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, and all other Deputies, as
the sole power in the “state” and as the harbinger of
the “withering away” of the state  in every form.


My fourth argument: we must reckon with the actual situation in
which socialism finds itself internationally.


It is not what it was during the years 1871 to 1914, when Marx
and Engels knowingly put up with the inaccurate, opportunist
term “Social-Democracy”. For  in those days,  after the
defeat of the Paris Commune, history made slow organisational
and educational work the task of the day. Nothing else was
possible. The anarchists were then (as they are now)
fundamentally wrong not only theoretically, but also
economically and politically. The anarchists misjudged the
character of the times, for they failed to understand the world
situation: the worker of Britain corrupted by imperialist
profits, the Commune defeated in Paris, the recent (1871)
triumph of the bourgeois national movement in Germany, the
age-long sleep of semi-feudal Russia.


Marx and Engels gauged the times accurately; they understood the
international situation; they understood that the approach to
the beginning of the social revolution must be  slow.


We, in our turn, must also understand the specific features and
tasks of the new era. Let us not imitate those sorry Marxists of
whom Marx said: “I have sown dragon’s teeth and harvested
fleas.”[2]


The objective inevitability of capitalism which grew into
imperialism brought about the imperialist war. The war has
brought mankind to the  brink of a precipice,  to the
brink of the destruction of civilisation, of the brutalisation

    

and destruction of more millions, countless millions, of human
beings.


The only way out is through a proletarian revolution.


At the very moment when such a revolution is beginning, when it
is taking its first hesitant, groping steps, steps betraying too
great a confidence in the bourgeoisie, at such a moment the
majority (that is the truth, that is a fact) of the
“Social-Democratic” leaders, of the “Social-Democratic”
parliamentarians, of the “Social-Democratic” newspapers—and
these are precisely the  organs that influence the
people—have  deserted socialism, have
betrayed socialism and have gone over to the side of
“their own” national bourgeoisie.


The people have been confused, led astray and deceived by
these leaders.


And we shall aid and abet that deception if we retain the old
and out-of-date Party name, which is as decayed as the Second
International!


Granted that “many” workers  understand
Social-Democracy in an honest way; but it is time to learn how
to distinguish the subjective from the objective.


Subjectively, such Social-Democratic workers are most loyal
leaders of the proletarians.


Objectively, however, the world situation is such that the old
name of our Party  makes it easier to fool the people
and impedes the onward march; for at every step, in every paper,
in every parliamentary group, the masses see  leaders,
i.e., people whose voices carry farthest and whose actions are
most conspicuous; yet they are all “would-be Social-Democrats”,
they are all “for unity” with the betrayers of socialism, with
the social-chauvinists; and they are all presenting for payment
the old bills issued by “Social-Democracy”. . . .


And what are the arguments against? . . . We’ll be confused with
the Anarchist-Communists, they say. . . .


Why are we not afraid of being confused with the
Social-Nationalists, the Social-Liberals, or the
Radical-Socialists, the foremost bourgeois party in the French
Republic and the most adroit in the bourgeois deception of the
people? . . . We are told: The people are used to it, the
workers have come to “love”  their Social-Democratic
Party.

 

That is the only argument. But it is an argument that dismisses
the science of Marxism, the tasks of the morrow in the
revolution, the objective position of world socialism, the
shameful collapse of the Second International, and the harm done
to the practical cause by the packs of “would-be
Social-Democrats” who surround the proletarians.


It is an argument of routinism, an argument of inertia, an
argument of stagnation.


But we are out to rebuild the world. We are out to put an end to
the imperialist world war into which hundreds of millions of
people have been drawn and in which the interests of billions
and billions of capital are involved, a war which cannot end in
a truly democratic peace without the greatest proletarian
revolution in the history of mankind.


Yet we are afraid of our own selves. We are loth to cast off the
“dear old” soiled shirt. . . .


But it is time to cast off the soiled shirt and to put on clean
linen.

## Postscript









Lenin: 1917/tasks: POSTSCRIPT







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution
(Draft Platform for the Proletarian Party)



    


POSTSCRIPT


My pamphlet has become out of date owing to the general economic
disorganisation and the inefficiency of the St. Petersburg
presses. The pamphlet was written on April 10, 1917, today is
May 28, and it has not come out yet! 

It was written as a draft platform to propagandise my
views before the All-Russia Conference of our
Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party of
Bolsheviks. The pamphlet was typed in several copies and handed
out to Party members before and during the Conference so that it
did its job in part. But the Conference took place from April 24
to April 29,1917, its resolutions have long since been published
(see supplement to

Soldatskaya
Pravda
No. 13[6]) and the attentive reader will have
noticed that my pamphlet often served as the original draft of
those resolutions. 

It is left for me to express the hope that the pamphlet will
still be of some value because of its connection with those
resolutions and because it explains them, and to deal here with
two points. 

I suggested on page 27 that
we remain in Zimmerwald only for purposes of
information.[1]

The
Conference did not agree with me on this point, and I had to
vote against the resolution on the International. It is now
becoming obvious that the Conference made a mistake and that the
course taken by events will soon correct it. By remaining in
Zimmerwald we (even against our will) are helping delay the
creation of the Third International; we are indirectly hampering
its foundation, being burdened with the dead ballast of the
ideologically and politically dead Zimmerwald.

 
In the eyes of the working-class parties of the whole world,
our Party’s position is now such that it is our duty to
found a Third International without delay. 
Today there is nobody but us to do it, and procrastination
can only do harm. If we remain in Zimmerwald for information only,
we shall have our hands freed to establish the new International
(and at the same time be able to use Zimmerwald should
circumstances make it possible). 

Because of the mistake made by the Conference, we must now wait
passively, at least until July 5, 1917 (the date set for the
Zimmerwald Conference, provided it is not postponed
again! It has already been postponed
once. . .). 

The decision unanimously adopted by the Central Committee of our
Party after the Conference and published in Pravda
No. 55, on May 12, has, however, gone half-way towards
correcting the mistake; it has been resolved that we shall walk
out of Zimmerwald if they decide to confer with
ministers.[2]

I
express the hope that the other half of the mistake will be
speedily remedied, as soon as we convene the first international
conference of Lefts (the “third trend”, the “internationalists
in deed”, see above,
pp. 23–25[3]

).



The second point I must deal with is the formation of the “coalition
cabinet” on May 6,
1917.[7] On this point the pamphlet may
seem to be particularly out of
date. 

But actually on this of all points it is not out of date at
all. It is based wholly on the
class analysis, a thing that the Mensheviks and
Narodniks, who have provided six ministers as hostages to
the
ten capitalist ministers, stand in deadly fear of. And it is
because the pamphlet is based wholly on a class analysis that it
is not out of date—the only change made by Tsereteli, Chernov
and Co . joining the cabinet was an insignificant
one in the form of the agreement between the
Petrograd Soviet and the capitalist government, and I
deliberately stressed in my pamphlet (on page 8) that “I am referring
not so much to the formal agreement as to
actual support” [4]


With each passing day it is becoming clearer that Tsereteli,
Chernov and Co. are nothing more than hostages to

    

the
capitalists, that the “renewed” government is neither willing
nor able to carry out any of its abundant promises either in
foreign or domestic policies. Chernov, Tsereteli and Co. have
committed political suicide by turning into assistants of the
capitalists, into people who are actually strangling the
revolution; Kerensky has come so low as to use force against the
masses (cf.p. 9 of the pamphlet:
“Guchkov is still only threatening to employ violence against
the
mass”[5]

but Kerensky had to carry out those
threats[8]). Chernov, Tsereteli and Co. have
killed themselves and their parties—the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries—politically. The people will
realise this more and more clearly as the days go
by. 

The coalition cabinet is only a passing moment in the
development of the fundamental class contradictions of our
revolution briefly analysed in the pamphlet. This situation
cannot last long—we must either go backward to
counter-revolution all along the line or forward to the transfer
of state power to other classes. At a time of revolution, when
the imperialist world war is in progress, we cannot stand
still.

Lenin
is referring to the order by War Minister Kerensky published on
May 11 (24), 1917, containing a “Declaration of the Rights of
the Soldier”, in which there was a point allowing a superior
officer to use military force in cases of insubordination in the
field. This point was aimed against soldiers and officers who
refused to go into the attack.  Simultaneously with the
promulgation of this order Kerensky started to disband regiments
and prosecute officers and soldiers guilty of ’inciting to
insubordination’.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
This pamphlet was written at the beginning of April 1917,
before the coalition cabinet was formed. Since then much water has
flown under the bridge, but the principal characteristics of the
major political parties have held true in the course of all
subsequent stages of the revolution—both during the coalition
cabinet, which came into being on May 6, 1917, during the union
between the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in June (and
July) 1917 against the Bolsheviks, during the Kornilov events, and
during the October Revolution of 1917 and after it.


The correctness of the characteristic given to the principal
parties and their class foundations has been borne out
by the whole course of the Russian revolution. Today the progress of the revolution in Western Europe shows that there, too,
the line-up of the principal parties is the same. The role of
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries is being played by the
social-chauvinists of all countries (socialists in word and
chauvinists in deed) as well as by the Kautskyites in Germany,
the Longuetists in France, and so on.


N. Lenin


Moscow, October 22, 1918


Published in 1918 in the pamphlet: N. Lenin, Political Parties in Russia and the Tasks of the Proletariat, Kommunist Publishing House, Moscow

Published according to the pamphlet text



 

The following is an attempt to formulate, first, the more
important and then the less important questions and answers
characterising the present political situation in Russia and the
way it is understood by the various parties.

QUESTIONS:


1) WHAT ARE THE CHIEF POLITICAL

PARTY GROUPINGS IN RUSSIA?

ANSWERS:

A. (to the right of the C.D.). Parties and groups to the right
of the Constitutional-Democrats.


B. (G.D.). The Constitutional-Democratic
Party (Cadets, or the people’s freedom party) and kindred
groups.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). The Social-Democrats,
the Socialist-
Revolutionaries and kindred groups.


D. ("Bolsheviks").
The party which properly should be called the Communist Party,
but which at present is named the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party united under the Central Committee or, popularly,
the “Bolsheviks”.



2) WHAT CLASSES DO THESE PARTIES REPRESENT?

WHAT CLASS STANDPOINT DO THEY EXPRESS?


A. (to the right of the C.D.). The feudalist landowners and the
most backward sections of the bourgeoisie (Capitalists).


B. (G.D.). The bourgeoisie as a whole, that is, the capitalist
class, and the landowners who have become bourgeois, i.e., who
have become capitalists.

 

C. (S.D. and S.R.). Small proprietors, small and middle
peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and that section of the workers
which has come under the influence of the bourgeoisie.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Class-conscious proletarians, wage- workers
and the poor peasantry (semi-proletarians) standing close to
them.



3) WHAT IS THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOCIALISM?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and


B. (G.D.). Decidedly hostile, since it threatens the profits of
the capitalists and landowners.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). For socialism, but it is too early to think
of it or to take any immediate practical steps for its
realisation.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). For socialism. The Soviets
must immediately take all possible practicable steps for its
realisation.[1]



4) WHAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT DO THEY WANT AT PRESENT?


A. (to the right of the C.D.). A constitutional monarchy, the
absolute power of the bureaucracy and the police.


B. (G.D.). A bourgeois parliamentary republic, i.e., the
consolidation of the rule of the capitalists, while retaining
the old bureaucracy and the police.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). A bourgeois parliamentary republic, with
reforms for the workers and peasants.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). A republic of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’,
Peasants’, and other Deputies. Abolition of the standing army
and the police, who are to be replaced by the arming of the
whole people; officials to be not only elective, but also
displaceable; their pay not to exceed that of a competent
worker.



5) WHAT IS THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESTORATION

OF THE ROMANOV MONARCHY?

A. (to the right of the C.D.). They are for it,
but act covertly and cautiously, for they are afraid of the people

 

B. (C.D.). When the Guchkovs seemed to be a power, the Cadets
were for putting a brother or the son of Nicholas on the throne;
but when the people began to seem a power, the Cadets became
anti-monarchist.


C. (S.D. and SR.) and D. (“Bolsheviks”). Decidedly opposed to
restoration of the monarchy in any form.



6) WHAT IS THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE SEIZURE OF POWER?

WHAT DO THEY REGARD AS ORDER, AND WHAT AS ANARCHY?


A. (to the right of the C.D.). If a tsar or some gallant general
seizes power, that is God-given, that is order. All else is
anarchy.


B. (C.D.). If the capitalists seize power, even by force, that
is order; to seize power against the capitalists would be
anarchy.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). If the Soviets alone seize all the power,
that means a threat of anarchy. Let the capitalists keep the
power for the time being, and the Soviets keep the “Contact
Commission”.[4]


D. (“Bolsheviks”). All power must be in the hands of the Soviets
of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, Agricultural Labourers and
other Deputies. All propaganda, agitation and the organisation
of the millions must immediately be directed towards
this
end.[2]



7) SHOULD THE
PROVISIONAL
GOVERNMENT BE SUPPORTED?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). Unquestionably,
since it is the only government capable at this moment of
safeguarding the interests of the capitalists.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). It should, but on condition that it carries
out its agreement with the Soviet and attends the meetings of
the Contact
Commission.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). No; let the capitalists support it. Our job
is to prepare the people for full and undivided power
wielded by the Soviets.

    



8) FOR UNDIVIDED POWER OR DUAL POWER?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). For the undivided
power of the capitalists and landowners.


C. (S. D. and S. R.). For dual power. The Soviets to exercise
“control” over the Provisional Government. It is bad to reflect
whether control can be effective without power.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). For the undivided power of the Soviets from
the bottom up all over the country.



9) SHOULD A CONSTITUENT
ASSEMBLY BE CONVENED?

A. (to the right of the C.D.). No, for it might
prejudice the landowners. You never know—the peasants in the
Constituent Assembly may decide that the landowners ought to have
their estates taken away from them.


B. (C.D.). Yes, but without fixing a date. As much time as
possible should be spent consulting professors of law; first,
because, as Bebel said, jurists are the most reactionary people
in the world; and, second, because the experience of all
revolutions has shown that the cause of popular freedom is lost
’when it is entrusted to professors.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Yes, and as quickly as possible. A date must
be fixed; we have already said so two hundred times at the
meetings of the Contact Commission, and shall say so again
tomorrow, for the last and two-hundred-and- first time.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Yes, and as soon as possible. But there is
only one way to assure its convocation and success, and that is
by increasing the number and strength of the Soviets
and organising and arming the working-class
masses. That is the only guarantee.



10) DOES THE STATE NEED THE USUAL TYPE OF POLICE

AND A STANDING ARMY?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). It certainly does,
for they are the only firm guarantee of the rule of the
capitalists; in case of need, as the, experience of all countries has shown, the return from a republic to a monarchy is
thus greatly facilitated.

 

C. (S.D. and S.R.). On the one hand, they are perhaps not
necessary. On the other hand, is not so radical a change
premature? However, we shall raise the matter in the Contact
Commission.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). It definitely does not. The arming of the
entire people must be proceeded with everywhere immediately and
unreservedly, and they must be merged with the militia and the
army. The capitalists must pay the workers for days served in
the militia.



11) DOES THE STATE NEED A BUREAUCRACY OF THE USUAL TYPE?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and
B. (C.D.). Most decidedly. Nine-tenths of them are the Sons and
brothers of land owners and capitalists. They must continue to
remain a privileged and, in practice, permanent body of
people.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). It is hardly fitting to raise so hastily a
question that was raised practically by the Paris Commune.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). It certainly does not. All officials and all
and every kind of deputy must not only be elective, but
displaceable at any moment. Their pay must not exceed that of a
competent worker. They must be replaced (gradually) by the
people’s militia and its detachments.



12) SHOULD OFFICERS BE ELECTED BY THE SOLDIERS?


A. (to the right oi the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). No. That would be
detrimental to the landowners and capitalists. If the soldiers
cannot be pacified otherwise, they must be temporarily promised
this reform, but it must be withdrawn at the earliest possible
moment.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Yes, they should.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Not only must they be elected, but every step
of every officer and general must be supervised by persons
specially elected for the purpose by the soldiers.



13) IS IT DESIRABLE FOR THE SOLDIERS,

ON THEIR OWN DECISION,

TO DISPLACE THEIR SUPERIORS?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). It is distinctly
harmful. Guchkov has already forbidden it. He has already
threatened to use force. Guchkov must be supported.

 

C. (S.D. and S.R.). It is. But it is not clear whether they
should be replaced before the matter is taken up with the
Contact Commission, or vice versa.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). It is desirable and essential in every
way. The soldiers will obey and respect only elected
authorities.



14) FOR OR AGAINST THE PRESENT WAR?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and
B. (C.D.). Decidedly for, because it yields the capitalists untold
profits and promises to consolidate their rule by disuniting the
workers and setting them against one another. We shall fool the
workers by calling the war a war for national defence, the real
object of which is to dethrone Wilhelm.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). In general we are opposed to imperialist
wars, but ’we are willing to be fooled, and are prepared to call
the support given to the imperialist war waged by the
imperialist government of Guchkovs Milyukov and
Co. “revolutionary defencism”.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). We are decidedly against all imperialist wars
and allbourgeois governments waging such wars,
including our own Provisional Government; we are decidedly
against “revolutionary defencism” in Russia.



15) FOR OR AGAINST THE PREDATORY INTERNATIONAL

TREATIES BETWEEN
THE TSAR, GREAT BRITAIN,

FRANCE, ETC. (FOR THE SUBJUGATION
OF PERSIA,

THE PARTITION OF CHINA, TURKEY,
AUSTRIA. ETC.)?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and
B. (C.D.). Absolutely and entirely for. At the same time,
we must not publish these treaties, both because Anglo-French
imperialist capital and its governments will not permit it, and
because Russian capital cannot afford to reveal its shady affairs
to the public.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Against, but we still hope that with the aid
of the Contact Commission and a series of “campaigns” among the
masses, it may be possible to “influence” the capitalist
government.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Against. The whole point is to enlighten the
masses as to the utter hopelessness of expecting anything

    

in
this respect from capitalist governments, and as to the
necessity of the power being transferred to the proletariat and
the poor peasants.



16) FOR OR AGAINST ANNEXATIONS?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). If
it is a question of annexations by the German capitalists and
their robber chieftain, Wilhelm, we are against. If by the
British, we are not against, for they are “our” Allies. If by our
capitalists, who are forcibly keeping within the boundaries of
Russia the peoples who were oppressed by the tsar, we are in
favour; we do not call that annexation.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Against annexations, but we still hope it
will be possible to secure even from the capitalist government a
promise to renounce annexations.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Against annexations. All promises on the part
of capitalist governments to renounce annexations are a sheer
fraud. There is only one method of exposing it, namely, to
demand the liberation of the peoples oppressed by their
owncapitalists.



17) FOR OR AGAINST THE LIBERTY LOAN?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). Decidedly for,
since it facilitates the conduct of the imperialist war, that
is, a war to determine which group of capitalists shall
rule the world.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). For, since the incorrect stand of
“revolutionary defencism” forces us into this obvious departure
from internationalism.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Against, since the war remains an imperialist war, waged by the capitalists in alliance with the
capitalists and in the interests of the capitalists.



18
) FOR OR AGAINST THE CAPITALIST GOVERNMENTS

ASCERTAINING THE
PEOPLES’ WILL TO PEACE?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.).
For, since the experience of the French republican
social-chauvinists was excellent proof that the people can be
fooled in this way; we can say anything we like, but in practice
we shall keep the

    

spoils seized from the Germans (their
colonies), while depriving the German robbers of the spoils
they have seized.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). For, since we have not yet relinquished a good many of the unfounded hopes placed by the petty
bourgeoisie in the capitalists.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Against, since the class-conscious workers
place no hopes whatever in the capitalists, and it is
our task to open the eyes of the masses to the futility of such
hopes.



19) MUST ALL MONARCHIES BE ABOLISHED?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). No;
the British, Italian and Allied monarchies generally must not be
abolished, but only the German, Austrian, Turkish, and Bulgarian,
since victory over them will multiply our profits.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). A certain “sequence” must be observed, and
in any case we should begin with Wilhelm; as to the Allied
monarchies, we had perhaps better wait a bit.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). No sequence can be established for
revolutions. We must help only the revolutionaries
in deed to abolish all monarchies in all
countries without exception.



20) SHALL THE PEASANTS TAKE ALL

THE LANDED ESTATES IMMEDIATELY?

A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.) By
no means. We must wait for the Constituent Assembly. Shingaryov
has already explained that when the capitalists seize power from
the tsar, that is a great and glorious revolution; but when the
peasants take the land away from the landowners, that is arbitrary
action.[5] Conciliation commissions must be appointed on which
landowners and peasants shall be equally represented, while the
chairmen shall be officials, that is, people drawn from among the
capitalists and landowners.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Better the peasants waited for the
Constituent Assembly.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). All the land must be taken over
immediately. Order must be strictly maintained by the Soviets of
Peasants’ Deputies. More grain and meat must be produced,

    

and
the soldiers better fed. Injury and damage to livestock,
implements, etc., must in no case be permitted.



21) CAN WE LEAVE LAND DISPOSAL

AND ALL RURAL AFFAIRS IN THE
HANDS

OF THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS’ DEPUTIES ALONE?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). The land owners and
capitalists are generally opposed to full and undivided power
being vested in the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies in the
countryside; but if these Soviets are unavoidable, then we had
better confine ourselves to them alone, for the rich peasants
are also capitalists.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). For the present, perhaps, yes, although
Social-Democrats “in principle” do not deny the necessity
of a separate organisation for the agricultural
wage-workers.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). We cannot confine ourselves to the general
Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies alone, for the wealthy peasants
are also capitalists and are always liable to wrong or cheat the
agricultural labourers, day-labourers, and poor
peasants. Therefore separate organisations for these groups of
the rural population must be set up immediately both within the
Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies and as separate Soviets of
deputies from the agricultural labourers.



22) SHALL THE PEOPLE TAKE OVER THE LARGEST

AND MOST POWERFUL
CAPITALIST MONOPOLIES,

THE BANKS, THE SYNDICATES OF
MANUFACTURERS. ETC.?


A. (to the right of the C.D.)and B. (C.D.). On no account, as
this might injure the landowners and capitalists.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Generally speaking, we are in favour of
transferring such organisations to the entire people, but it is
too early just now to think of this or prepare for it.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). We must at once start preparingthe
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, the Councils of Bank Employees’
Deputies, etc., for taking practical and practicable steps
towards merging all banks into a single national bank, to be
followed by the establishment of control by the Soviets of
Workers’ Deputies over the banks and syndicates, and then by
their nationalisation, i.e., their transfer to the possession of
the whole people.

    



23) WHAT KIND OF SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL

IMPLEMENTING A
FRATERNAL UNION

OF THE WORKERS OF ALL COUNTRIES

DO THE PEOPLES NOW NEED?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (C.D.). Generally speaking,
any kind of Socialist International is harmful and dangerous to
the capitalists and landowners; but if the German Plekhanov,
that is, Scheidemann, comes to an agreement and understanding
with the Russian Scheidemann, that is, Plekhanov, and if they
discover in each other vestiges of a socialist Conscience, then
it were perhaps better for us capitalists to welcome
suchan International of suchsocialists who
take the side of their ownrespective governments.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). We need a Socialist International that will
unite everybody: the Scheidemanns, the Plekhanovs and the
“Centrists”, i.e., those who vacillate between social-chauvinism
and internationalism. The greater the hotchpotch, the greater
the “unity”. Long live the great socialist unity!


D. (“Bolsheviks”). The peoples need only such an International
as will unite the really revolutionary workers, who are capable
of putting an end to this frightful, criminal slaughter of the
peoples and of delivering humanity from the yoke of
capital. Only people (groups, parties, etc.) like the German
Socialist Karl
Liebknecht, who is now in a convict prison, only people who
are resolutely fighting their owngovernment, their
ownbourgeoisie, their own social chauvinists, their
own “Centre”, can and must establish immediately the
International which the peoples need.



24) SHOULD FRATERNISATION AT THE FRONT BETWEEN SOLDIERS

OF THE
BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES BE ENCOURAGED?


A. (to the right of the C.D.) and B. (CD.). No, it is bad for
the interests of the landowners and capitalists, as it is likely
to hasten the liberation of humanity from their yoke.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Yes, it is desirable. But we are not all
fully convinced that such an encouragement of fraternisation
should be started immediately in all the belligerent countries.

 

D. (“Bolsheviks”).

Yes, it is desirable and essential. It is absolutely essential
to encourage immediately in all the belligerent countries
attempts at fraternisation between the soldiers of both
warring groups.



25) WHAT COLOUR BANNER WOULD BE IN CHARACTER WITH

THE VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES?


A. (to the right of the C.D.). Black, for they are the real Black
Hundreds.[6]


B. (C.D.). Yellow, for that is the international banner of
workers who serve capitalism willingly, heart and soul.


C. (S.D. and S.R.). Pink, for their whole policy is a rose-water
one.


D. (“Bolsheviks”). Red, for this is the banner of the
international proletarian revolution.



This pamphlet was written at the beginning of April
1917. To the question whether it is out of date now,
after May 6, 1917, after the formation of the “new”, coalition,
government, my answer is: No, for the Contact Commission has not
really disappeared, it has merely moved to another room, which it
shares with the gentlemen of the cabinet. The fact that the
Chernovs and the Tseretelis have moved to another room has rot
changed their policy, nor the policy of their parties.


 
Notes
 

[1]

For the nature of these steps, see questions 20 and 22.
—Lenin

[2]

Anarchy is the complete negation of State power, whereas the
Soviets are themselves a state power.
—Lenin
 



[3]
This
pamphlet was planned originally as a leaflet, owing to the fact
that the Cadets, S.R.s and Mensheviks were making wide use of
leaflets in their propaganda and pasted them up all over the
town. Lenin believed that a Bolshevik leaflet explaining what
every party was and what it stood for should be pasted alongside
the anti-Bolshevik proclamations. The article was too long to be
issued as a leaflet; it was published in the Helsingfors
Bolshevik newspaper Volna, and then issued in pamphlet form by
the Zhizn i Znaniye publishers in fifty thousand copies. The
proprietors of the printing-press, who sympathised with the
Cadets, held up publication, but with the help of the workers’
committee the pamphlet was issued on July 4(17). Owing to the
July events, however, it was hidden away in the publishers’
warehouse. A few days later it began to circulate in the
working-class quarters. The first edition sold out quickly and,
according to the testimony of V.D. Bonch-Bruyevich, a reprint
was put out.


The pamphlet

was issued

with the following introductory text:
“Explanation to the draft platform outlined by N. Lenin for
discussion at meetings of the Bolsheviks. The printing of the
draft itself has been held up owing to lack of printing
facilities in Petrograd.”  

The pamphlet was published in
English in the journal The Class Struggle (New York,
November-December 1917, Vol. 1, No.4, pp. 49-59) as well as in
The New York Evening Post, January 15, 1918.  

A second
edition of was published in Moscow in 1918 with a foreword by
Lenin."

Comrade soldiers! The question of the state system is now on the
order of the day. The capitalists, in whose hands the state
power now rests, desire a parliamentary bourgeois republic, that
is, a state system where there is no tsar, but where power
remains in the hands of the capitalists who govern the country
by means of the old institutions, namely: the police, the
bureaucracy, and the standing army.


We desire a different republic, one more in keeping with the
interests of the people, more democratic. The revolutionary
workers and soldiers of Petrograd have overthrown tsarism, and
have cleaned out all the police from the capital. The workers of
all the world look with pride and hope to the revolutionary
’workers and soldiers of Russia as the vanguard of the world’s
liberating army of the working class. The revolution, once
begun, must be strengthened and carried on. We shall not allow
the police to be re-established! All power in the state, from
the bottom up, from the remotest little village to every street
block of Petrograd, must belong to the Soviets of Workers’,
Soldiers’, Agricultural Labourers’, Peasants’ and other
Deputies. The central state power uniting these local Soviets
must be the Constituent Assembly, National Assembly, or Council
of Soviets—no matter by what name you call it.


Not the police, not the bureaucracy, who are unanswerable to the
people and placed above the people, not the standing army,
separated from the people, but the people themselves,
universally armed and united in the Soviets,

    

must run the
state. It is they who will establish the necessary order, it is
they whose authority will not only be obeyed, but also
respected, by the workers and peasants.


Only this power, only the Soviets of Soldiers’ and Peasants’
Deputies, can solve the great question of the land in a
non-bureaucratic way and not in the interests of the land
owners. The land must not belong to the landowners. The peasant
committees must take the land away at once from the landowners,
while carefully guarding all the property against damage, and
seeing to it that grain production is increased in
order that the soldiers at the front be better supplied. All the
land must belong to the whole nation, and its disposal must be
the concern of the local Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. In order
that the rich peasants—who are themselves capitalists—may
not wrong and deceive the agricultural labourers and the poor
peasants, it will be necessary for the latter either to confer,
to combine, to unite separately, or to set up Soviets of
Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies of their own.


Do not allow the police to be re-established, do not let the
state power or the administration of the state pass into the
hands of the bureaucracy, who are non-elective, undisplaceable,
and paid on a bourgeois scale; get together, unite, organise
yourselves, trusting no one, depending only on your own
intelligence and experience—and Russia will be able to move
with a firm, measured, unerring tread toward the liberation of
both our own country and of all humanity from the yoke of
capital as well as from the horrors of war.


Our government, a government of the capitalists, is continuing
the war in the interests of the capitalists. Like the German
capitalists, headed by their crowned brigand Wilhelm, the
capitalists of all the other countries are carrying on
the war only for a division of capitalist profits, for
domination over the world. Hundreds of millions of people,
almost all the countries in the world, have been dragged into
this criminal war. Hundreds of billions of capital have been
invested in “profitable” undertakings, bringing death, hunger,
ruin, and barbarism to the peoples and staggering, scandalously
high profits to the capitalists. There is only one way to get
out of this frightful war and conclude a truly democratic peace
not imposed by force, and that is

    

by transferring all the state
power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The
workers and poor peasants, who are not interested in preserving
the profits of the capitalists and robbing the weaker nations,
will be able to do effectively what the capitalists only
promise, namely, end the war by concluding a lasting peace that
will assure liberty to all peoples without exception.

It is not enough that the capitalist newspapers lie and carry on
a riot-mongering campaign against Pravda, that Rech
vies in this respect with Russkaya Volya—a paper
which it cannot but despise.


Now the ministers of the capitalist government, too, have begun
to speak in the language of Russkaya Volya.  Rech
quotes today Minister Nekrasov’s statement made before a meeting
of the Cadet Party in Moscow on April 9:



“The preaching of violence that comes from the Kamennoostrovsky
Prospekt is a terrible thing.”



Re-echoing Russkaya Volga,  the worthy Minister lies
shamelessly, deceives the people, and aids the riot-mongers
while hiding behind their backs. He dares not name directly a
single person, a single newspaper, a single orator, or a single
party.


The worthy Minister prefers dark hints—hoping that someone
will fall for it!


But all politically minded people will understand that the
worthy Minister is referring to the organ of the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., Pravda, and its
followers.


You are lying, Mr. Minister, worthy member of the “people’s
freedom” party. It is Mr. Guchkov who is preaching violence when
be threatens to punish the soldiers for dismissing the
authorities. It is Russkaya Volya, the riot mongering
newspaper of the riot-mongering "republicans”, a paper that
is friendly to you, that preaches violence.


Pravda and its followers do not preach violence. On the
contrary, they declare most clearly, precisely, and definitely
that our main efforts should now be concentrated on

    

explaining to the proletarian masses their proletarian
problems, as distinguished from the petty bourgeoisie which has
succumbed to chauvinist intoxication.


So long as you, capitalist gentlemen, Guchkov and Co.,
confine yourselves only to threats of violence, so long as you
have not yet resorted to violence, so long as the Soviets of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies exist, so long as you
have not yet carried out your threats against the Soviets (such
threats, for example, have actually been printed by
Mr. Milyukov’s associate, Mr. Wilson, the Times
correspondent), so long as you have not yet perpetrated violence
upon the masses, we Pravdists declare and reiterate that we
regard the Soviets as the only possible form of
government.


So long as you, capitalist gentlemen, who are in
control of the army command, have not yet begun to use
violence, it is our tactics, the tactics of all Pravdists
and of all our Party, to fight for influence among the
proletarian masses, to fight for influence among tile Soviets of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, to show up the errors
in their tactics, to show up all the falsity of the chauvinist
(revolutionary-defencist) intoxication.


The worthy Minister Nekrasov knows this perfectly well, if only
from the quotations which Rech itself was forced to
print. The worthy Minister re-echoes Russkaya Volya; he
is bent on preventing a calm demonstration of the truth
by resorting to lies, slander, baiting, and threats.


It won’t work, Messrs. Nekrasovs!


The workers and soldiers want to know the truth, they want to
clear up for themselves the questions of war and peace, and
state systems, and they will certainly do so.

“We have nevertheless compelled the Provisional Government to
renounce annexations.”

—From a speech by Y. Steklov,


delivered at the Taurida Palace on April 4.



“Whatever our attitude towards the slogan ’peace without
annexations’ may be, the principles accepted by all the Allies
cannot be ignored.”

—From a speech by P. Milyukov
(Rech,
April 11).


Step by step the leaders of the Provisional Government are
revealing the true nature of their policy in regard to the
War. The notorious declaration of the Provisional Government
contained, along with a verbal “renunciation” of annexations, a
statement to the effect that “our” treaties with the British and
the French governments remain valid. A couple of weeks later
Rech, the organ of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.
Milyukov, prints the following:

MILYUKOV’S STATEMENT


While in Moscow, P. N, Milyukov, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, made the following statement at a meeting of members of
the people’s freedom party:


The declaration of the Provisional Government concerning the
aims of the war contains not peace terms, but merely general
principles which have already been repeatedly enunciated by
various statesmen of our Allies. The peace terms can be worked
out only with the consent of our Allies and in accordance with
the London Convention. What ever our attitude towards the slogan
“peace without annexations” may be, the principles accepted by
all the Allies concerning the reunification

    

of Poland and
Armenia. And the gratification of the national aspirations of
the Austrian Slav’s, cannot be ignored. (Rech No. 83,
April 11 (24), 1917.)



This statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Milyukov,
will, without doubt, make the round of the whole foreign press
and intensify the military spirit in Germany. Milyukov
is helping the German imperialists to work up chauvinist feeling
in Germany; Milyukov is helping Wilhelm II to go through
with this predatory war “to the end”.


Let us examine Mr. Milyukov’s statement. The Provisional
Government’s declaration concerning the aims of the war (the
same declaration which Y. Steklov, by a deplorable
misunderstanding, calls renunciation of annexations) contains,
says Milyukov, not peace terms, but “merely general
principles which have already been repeatedly enunciated by
various statesmen of our Allies”. In plain language,this means
that renunciation of annexations is merely a fine phrase,
“general principles”, words, words, words, These words have also
been repeated any number of times by “our” Allies. The actual
“peace” terms, however, are a different matter entirely.


A statesman—Bismark, if I am not mistaken—once said that
to accept a thing “in principle” means, in the language
of diplomacy, to reject it in effect. The same with
Milyukov. “In principle” he is against annexations, in effect he
is for annexations. That is why he stands for war “to the
end”.


Fine phrases are not yet peace terms, Mr. Milyukov tells us.


What, then, are his peace terms?


These terms are covered by the London Convention. Mr. Milyukov
refers us to it.


But who concluded that Convention? Tsar Nicholas II concluded it
with the British and French capitalists! That means that the
treaties concluded by the tsarist clique still remain in
force. That means we are fighting for the sake of these
predatory treaties concluded by the tsarist clique and the
“Allied” bankers.


Seizure of Polish, Armenian, and Austrian territories (this time
Mr. Milyukov makes no mention of Constantinople)—this is what
Mr. Milyukov’s peace programme amounts to.

 

What will the leaders of the majority of the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies say regarding this latest statement of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Milyukov? All they will do is “reprove”
Milyukov for this statement of his in the name of the “Contact”
Commission.... What has become of the “Provisional Governments
renunciation of annexations”, which Y. Steklov and N. Chkheidze
claim to have obtained from it?


There is no dual power in Russia. The Soviet of Workers’
Deputies merely exercises a benevolent control over the
Provisional Government. This, if we are to believe the newspaper
reports, is what N. Chkheidze said at the military
conference in
Minsk.[1]


This is what we have come to with this benevolent control!
People who fan the flames of war are continuing to speak in the
name of Russia. The workers and soldiers are being fed with
platitudes about peace without annexations, while on the quiet a
policy is being pursued which benefits only a small clique of
millionaires who thrive on war.


Comrades, workers and soldiers! Read this statement of Milyukov
and expose it at all your meetings! Make it understood that you
do not wish to die for the sake of secret conventions concluded
by Tsar Nicholas II, and which are still sacred to Milyukov!

The methods of Russkaya
Volya, a paper from which even the Cadets
turn away in disgust, find an increasing number of
imitators. Look at Mr. Plekhanov’s
Yedinstvo.
Intent on “exposing” Pravda,
Mr. Plekhanov takes Lenin’s first thesis, quotes the words
saying that the war on Russia’s part remains a predatory
imperialist war, and then triumphantly asks:



“And how about Germany? Lenin says nothing about that.”



This, literally, is what he writes. The reader can scarcely
believe the evidence of his own eyes. Can it be that
Mr. Plekhanov has sunk to the level of Novoye Vremya
and Russkaya Volya? Believe it or not, but the fact
stares you in the face.


Mr. Plekhanov’s shamelessness knows no bounds. He is perfectly
familiar with the Bolshevik literature published abroad. He
knows perfectly well that all Bolsheviks, times without number,
in their speeches, articles, and resolutions, have always
declared that the war on the party of Germany was just
as predatory and imperialist as it was on the part of the
other belligerent “Great” Powers. The German capitalists, and
their chieftain, the crowned brigand Wilhelm, are the same
imperialist predators as the capitalists of other countries
are.


We repeat: no intelligent person who knows anything at all about
the Bolsheviks can help knowing that this is our point of
view. Mr. Plekhanov, too, knows this perfectly well. He knows
that Zinoviev’s and Lenin’s pamphlet, Socialism and
War,[1]

was published in Switzerland also in the German

    

language, and smuggled into Germany. And that pamphlet states as
blunt as blunt can be that Germany is carrying on a predatory
war for the purpose of “plundering competitor countries”, that
Germany is “a young and strong robber”, that “the
German imperialists have brazenly violated the neutrality of
Belgium, as belligerent states have done always and
everywhere, trampling upon all treaties and obligations if
necessary”; that “Kautsky reconciles in an unprincipled way the
fundamental idea of social-chauvinism—recognition of
defence of the fatherland in the present war—with a sham
concession to the Lefts”; that “opportunist-chauvinists have
nowhere sunk to such foul apostasy as in Germany”.


Mr. Plekhanov knows all this perfectly well, yet he sinks to the
methods of Novoye Vremya and Russkaya Volya,
and tries to paint the followers of Pravda as
Germanophiles.


Making a mockery of Marxism, Mr. Plekhanov further quibbles over
the question as to who declared war on whom.


Mr. Plekhanov has forgotten that Marxists regard war as a
continuation of the policies pursued by definite
governments representing definite classes.


That both Nicholas II and Wilhelm II represented the reactionary
and capitalist classes of their respective countries, that
during the last few decades both had been pursuing a policy of
plundering foreign countries, plundering China, subjugating
Persia, carving up and partitioning Turkey, is a well-known
fact. Had Mr. Plekhanov touched, however lightly, upon the
history of diplomacy and foreign policies during the last few
decades, he could not have failed to see this, and would not
have dared to deny it.


The war waged by Nicholas II and Wilhelm II has been just the
continuation of this predatory imperialist policy,
which is so closely bound up with the banking capital of the two
countries.


And when war is waged between two groups of predators and
oppressors merely for division of the spoils of plunder, merely
to see who will strangle more peoples,
who will grab more, the question as to who
began this war, who was the first to declare it and so forth, is
of no economic or political significance.


Mr. Plekhanov, just like the German Plekhanovs, the Scheidemanns
and Co., has descended to the level of the

    

most vulgar and
ordinary bourgeois chauvinist who refuses to see (if he ever did
see) that war is a continuation of policy, that war and policy
are bound up with the interests of definite classes, and that
one must be able to understand who these classes are and what
they are fighting for.


A vicious, shameless lie, a screen for the predatory policy of
Nicholas II—a policy which has not been abandoned by Lvov
and Co. (they have even confirmed the tsar’s treaties!)—that is
what Mr. Plekhanov’s great wisdom amounts to.


This lie will mislead neither the class-conscious workers nor
the class-conscious soldiers.

A popular method always used by the bourgeois press in every
country with unerring effect is to lie, scream, raise a
hullabaloo, and keep on reiterating lies on the off-chance that
“something may stick”.


“Lenin makes a great noise in the Kshesinskaya mansion,” writes
Rech.
“Lenin addresses a meeting from the roof of the Modern,” a
number of newspapers report.


All this is untrue. Lenin was not present at the Modern
meeting. Lenin made no noise at all; he delivered only
one report to a gathering of Bolsheviks and
Mensheviks[See: April
Theses],[1] and published a number of short articles in
the small newspaper Pravda.


It is the capitalists and the capitalist press who are making a
great noise, who are trying to shout down the truth, to
prevent it from being heard, to drown it in a torrent of
invective and shouts, to prevent an earnest
elucidation of the facts.


This is what the efforts of the capitalists add up to at the
present moment, as do also the efforts of those so-called
socialists who, like Mr.
Plekhanov, have completely deserted to the capitalist
side.


In an editorial of special “national importance”, today’s
Rech again fulminates against the “preaching of
anarchy”, and while doing so, most strikingly confutes
itself. This is clear to anyone who ponders what he has read or
heard.


“The great revolution has swept away all the old organisation of
power...”  This is not true. Not all of it, far from it. “It call be
restored only by a change in the national psychology (in a broad sense
of the word)—or rather, by the new psychology which recognises
the need for authority and the duty of submission.”

 

We have here a patent lie, a patent partnership of lies
contracted by the capitalists, on the one hand, and the
Plekhanovs, Cherevanins and Co., who are shouting about anarchy,
on the other.


In conversational usage as well as in science it is accepted
without question that anarchism means the negation of the
state in the period of transition from capitalism to
socialism.


That socialism leads to the “withering away” of the state is one
of the tenets of Marxism. The Milyukovs,
Plekhanovs, Cherevanins and others, who are partners in lies,
know this very well.


Do the Pravdists or Lenin deny the need for the state
now? Do they deny the need for an “organisation of power”,
the “duty of submission” to it?


Anybody who knows his politics, anybody except the partnership
of liars, is perfectly well aware that they do not.


Both Pravda
and Lenin have stated and repeated as clear as clear can be that
all of us unreservedly recognise the need for the state and for
an organisation of power not only for the present, but also for
the later historical period when the transition from capitalism
to socialism will be taking place.


Only the partnership of lies can deny this, or fail to see it.


The question is what “organisation of power” we
propose to the nation.


Not the old organisation of power, not the police, not
the bureaucracy, not the standing army, but a new
organisation—the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’
and
other Deputies.


Such Soviets
already exist; they have been brought forth by the revolution;
they are already recognised by everyone, even by the
capitalist government, as a semi-government.


And we have stated as clear as clear can be that these
Soviets are the only possible form of a revolutionary
government.


Can there be anything less ambiguous?


Since it is the “only possible” form, that means we must act
only through propaganda, unless someone begins to
practise violence upon the masses.


“The need for authority and the duty of submission” has

    

been
recognised by all the Pravdists, who are preaching it
to the people.


The Milyukovs,
Plekhanovs, Cherevanins and Co. lie in order to conceal the
truth from the people; they lie in order to suppress the
most important thing of all—the question of the
class character of any given organisation of power.


That is the crux of the matter.


The capitalist calls the Soviets anarchy, because
such an organisation of power does not commit the people
before hand and unconditionally to capitalist subjection, but provides
liberty and order together with the possibility of a peaceful and
gradual transition to socialism.


This and this alone is what rouses the displeasure, tired indignation
and resentment of the capitalists. Hence the partnership of
lies. Hence the torrent of slander and the howl of rage.


Hence, the underhand riot-mongering which Rech resorts to in
the above-mentioned editorial when it calls for “counteraction”, for
“renunciation of passivity, indifference”, and so on.

If you have the majority of the nation behind you, if your alliance
with the Soviet is a lasting one (and we frankly admit that at the
present moment the majority in the Soviet is not with us), then what
do you fear, gentlemen, why do you lie?


All we want is to make clear to the workers
and to the poor peasants the errors of their tactics. We
recognise the Soviets as the only possible
authority. We advocate the need for authority and the duty of
submitting to it.


Why, then, are you afraid? Why do you lie?


It is the truth that you fear. You lie in order to prevent
this truth from emerging, prevent it by means of
riot-mongering, slander, violence, and filth.


Even some of our opponents now see this. Read today’s Dyelo
Naroda,[2] organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
an organ to which Minister Kerensky
contributes.


This is what that organ says about Plekhanov, the most faithful ally
of Russkaya Volya and Rech:


“We are accustomed to see such words and such a method of struggle in
the columns of Russkaya
Volya. But to see

    

them employed in articles written by
socialists is, frankly speaking, painful and depressing...” 

Thus write our opponents.


Thus write democrats whose democratic conscience has been awakened.


It is hopeless trying to put the Milyukovs, Plekhanovs and Cherevanins
to shame. But when even a newspaper to which Minister Kerensky is a
contributor turns away in disgust from the madly chauvinistic,
infamously slanderous, riot-mongering methods employed by Plekhanov,
then we may safely say:


They are dead people, the heroes of such methods.

N. N. Pokrovsky, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
present Vice-Chairman of the Central War Industries Committee,
has become a member of the Board of the Russian Bank for Foreign
Commerce. Count V. N. Kokovtsov, the former Chairman of the
Council of Ministers, has also become a member of the Board.


These happy tidings were brought to us by last night’s
papers.


A minister today, a banker tomorrow; a banker today, a minister
tomorrow. It is “war to the end”—both today and
tomorrow.


This state of affairs prevails not only in Russia, but in every
other country where Capital rules. A handful of bankers, who
have the whole world in their grip, are making a fortune out of
the war.


But Pokrovsky and Kokovtsov, we may be told, were ministers
during the old regime, and we are now living in a regenerated
Russia.


We will answer with a question:


In how many banks do the present ministers, Guchkov,
Tereshchenko, and Konovalov—have an interest (in the
capacity of directors, shareholders, or actual owners)?



Our comrades, the bank employees (who, by the way, should
organise a union of their own as soon as possible), would do
well to gather material on this subject and publish it in the
labour press.

Today’s editorial in Dyelo
Naroda, a newspaper which lists Minister Kerensky
among its most active contributors contains a forthright
statement to the effect that “according to information this
paper has received from people whom we consider quite competent
in this matter, the above-mentioned note {namely, the diplomatic
note proclaiming renunciation of the policy of annexations and
indemnities} has not yet been forwarded”.


And so those members and supporters of the Soviet of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Deputies who say and think that “we have made the
government renounce annexations” are mistaken.


Comrades and citizens! Read and reread this statement by
Dyelo Naroda, ponder its meaning!


The editorial goes on to say:



“And here Mr. Guchkov, echoing his bellicose Palace Square
colleague, who covets and lusts after Constantinople and the
Straits, in his appeal to the army on the Rumanian front throws
out slogans calling for the utter defeat of Germany and Austria



If Dyelo Naroda knows that Milyukov covets and lusts
after annexations, then why not tell us more about it? Does not
the people’s cause require that Dyelo
Naroda[1]

speak out
more clearly and frankly?


The editorial ends by calling attention to the “bellicose
members of our Provisional Government”.


Once more: Does not the people’s cause require that the paper
bearing that title make known names and facts, facts and
names?

Comrades, soldiers! Comrades, sailors!


The capitalist newspapers, from Rech
down to Russkaya
Volya, are carrying on a most shameless campaign of
lies and slander concerning the passage through Germany of
myself and thirty other emigrants.


The capitalist newspapers shamelessly lie when they assort or
insinuate that we enjoyed certain inadmissible or unusual
favours from the German Government, a government which we
consider just as predatory, just as criminal, as all the other
capitalist governments who are carrying on the present war.


Rich men having “connections” with high-ranking officials of the
tsarist monarchy, men like the liberal professor Kovalevsky,
friend of Milyukov and Co., have been constantly negotiating
with the German Government through the agency of the tsarist
Russian Government with a view to arranging for an exchange of
Russians captured by the Germans, and Germans captured by the
Russians.


Why then should emigrants, who have been compelled to live
abroad because of their struggle against the tsar, not have the
right to arrange for an exchange of Russians for Germans
without the government’s aid?


Why has the government of Milyukov and Co. not admitted into
Russia Fritz Platten, the Swiss socialist, who travelled with us
and who had negotiated the agreement with the German Government
concerning the exchange?


The government lies when it spreads rumours that Platten is a
friend of the Germans. This is sheer slander. Platten is the
friend of the workers and the enemy of the capitalists of
all countries.

 

The capitalists lie when they circulate rumours that we are for
a separate peace with the Germans, that we conferred or wanted
to confer in Stockholm with those German socialists who sided
with their own government.


This is a libellous lie. We did not participate and shall not
participate in any conferences with such socialists. We look
upon the socialists of all countries who are helping their
own respective capitalists to carry on this criminal war as
traitors to the cause of socialism.


Only those socialists are our friends who, like Karl
Liebknecht, condemned to hard labor by the predatory German
Government, rise against their own capitalists.


We do not want a separate peace with Germany, we want peace for
all nations, we want the victory of the workers of
all countries over the capitalists of all
countries.


The Russian capitalists are lying about us and slandering us,
just as the German capitalists are slandering Liebknecht. The
capitalists lie when they say that we want discord and enmity
between the workers and the soldiers.


It is not true! We want the workers and the soldiers to
unite. We want to make it clear to the members
of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies that it is
these Soviets that must wield full state
power.


The capitalists are slandering us. They have sunk so low in
their shamelessness that not a single bourgeois newspaper has
reprinted from Izvestia
our report concerning our journey and the decision of the
Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies. [See: How we
Arrived]


Every worker and every soldier knows his Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. It was to the Executive
Committee of this Soviet that we made our report the day after
our arrival. The report appeared in
Investia.[1]

Why is it
that not a single capitalist paper has reprinted this
report?


Because these papers are spreading lies and slander and are
afraid that our report to the Executive Committee will expose
the deceivers.


Why is it that not a single paper has reprinted the
decision of the Executive Committee concerning our
report, a decision which was published in the same issue of
Izvestia?

 

Because this decision nails the lies of the capitalists and
their newspapers, in that it demands that the government take
steps for the return of the emigrants.


Izvestia has published a protest against Trotsky’s
arrest by the English; it has published a letter by Zurabov
exposing Milyukov’s lies; it has also published a telegram from
Martov on the same subject.


Soldiers and sailors! Do not believe the lies and slander of the
capitalists! Expose the deceivers, who are trying to suppress
the truth published in Izvestia!

This document is a redraft of the appeal To
the Soldiers and Sailors, and was adopted by the Petrograd City
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks) on April 14 (27), 1917
during the discussion, out of order, of Point 6 of the agenda, namely,
“The Hounding Campaign Against Pravda”.


Citizens! The paper Russkaya
Volya, founded by the tsar’s Minister Protopopov and despised even
by the Cadets, is carrying a riot-provoking campaign against our
Party, against the paper Pravda,
against our Comrades Lenin and Zinoviev,
against the Petrograd [Soviet] Committee of
our Party housed in the Kshesinskaya mansion. We have received a
number of reports, written as well as oral, concerning threats of
violence, bomb threats, etc.


From the very first days of the [February]
revolution, the capitalists, masking as “republicans”, have been
trying to sow enmity between the workers and the soldiers. First they
lied about the workers wanting to leave the army without bread. Now
they are trying to inflame feeling against Pravda.


We appeal to the sense of honour of the revolutionary workers and
soldiers of Petrograd, and declare:


We not only have not been guilty, directly or indirectly, of any
threats of violence against individuals, but, on the contrary, we have
always maintained that our task is to explain our views to all the
people, that we regard the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies, elected by all the workers and the soldiers, as the
only possible revolutionary government.


On the very next day after their arrival, the comrades,
members of different parties, who passed through Germany,
made a report to the trusted representatives of all
the workers and soldiers, namely, to the Executive Committee
of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. On this Executive
Committee were Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Skobelev, Steklov, and others.

 

Comrades! These leaders of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies differ with us on many questions pertaining to the
organisation of the state. They could be anything but biased in our
favour.


Now what did the Executive Committee do?


In its Izvestia
No. 32, for April 5, 1917, it published the full
report dealing with the passage through Germany.


This report gives all the facts, and the names of the foreign
socialists from two neutral countries, Switzerland and Sweden, who
checked our protocols.


And what was the decision of the Executive Committee? Did it express
condemnation or even disapproval of the fact that Lenin and others
travelled through Germany?


It did not. This is how the editors of Izvestia, in
the same issue, reported the resolution of the Executive Committee:



“Having heard the report of Comrades Zurabov and Zinoviev, the
Executive Committee decided to take the matter up immediately with the
Provisional Government and to take steps towards securing the
immediate return to Russia of all emigrants, irrespective of their
political views and their attitude towards the war. The results of the
negotiations with the government will be published in the near
future.—Editors.”



As anyone can see, not a single word is said here against
Lenin and his comrades. What we have is a warning to the
Provisional Government, a decision to take steps to prevent
it from hindering return to Russia.


Following this, Martov’s
telegram and Trotsky’s arrest in Britain have shown that Milyukov
is either powerless against Britain and France, who keep their own
internationalist socialists imprisoned, or that he does not
want to take serious measures.


The Germans and Russians have made exchanges dozens of times
throughout the war. Kovalevsky, member of the Council of State, was
exchanged for an Austrian, etc. For wealthy people such exchanges have
been arranged by the governments many a time. Then why doesn’t the
present government want to arrange such an exchange for the emigrants?
Because it wants to prevent a number of fighters from taking part in
the revolutionary struggle.


What does Russkaya Volya do, and papers like Rech
and Yedinstvo
that follow in its footsteps?

 

They continue their hounding campaign, thereby inciting ignorant
people to acts of violence against individuals. They refuse to
publish either the report or the resolution of the Executive
Committee.


The Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies has been given the names of various socialists who
verified and approved every step taken by the emigrants in
connection with their journey. They are the French socialists
Loriot and Guilbeaux, the Swiss socialist Platten, the
Swedish socialists Lindhagen (Mayor of Stockholm),
Carleson, Striom, Nerman, the German socialist Hartstein
of Karl Liebknecht’s group, the Polish socialist Bronski.


By acting this way Russkaya Volya, Rech and
Yedinstvo are aiding and abetting the dark forces which
threaten violence, bombs, and riots.


Comrades, soldiers and workers!


We warn you against these gentlemen of Russkaya Volya,
Rech and Yedinstvo, and declare over and over
again that we stand for explaining to the whole nation the views
of all the parties, we stand for respecting the Soviet of
Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies.


If the Provisional Government, if Rech, if Mr. Plekhanov
are displeased with the way the Executive Committee of the
Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies has acted, why do
they not say so openly? Why do they not demand a re-examination
of the case? Why are they afraid to reprint what was
published in Izvestia No. 52? Why? Because they are out
to sow discord!


If violence in any form is resorted to, we shall place the
responsibility on the editors and contributors of Russkaya
Volya, Rech, Yedinstvo, and others, who have dared
to keep the report and the resolution of the Executive Committee
out of the press, and to carry on an insidious propaganda.


The paper Dyelo
Naroda, to which Minister A. F. Kerensky
is an active contributor, has already pointed out that the
methods used by these newspapers are helping the riot-mongers
(Dyelo Naroda No. 23).


We want the Milyukovs, Amfiteatrovs, Plekbanovs and Co. to know
that if their baiting leads to violence they will be the first
to suffer the consequences.


Down with riot-mongering! Down with the heroes of

    

baiting and
deception, who suppress the resolution of the Executive Committee!


Comrades, soldiers and workers! You will not allow the people’s
freedom to be marred by riots! You will see to it that the
decisions of your Soviet of Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies are
respected.

Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.
Petrograd Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.

Today’s Rech
concludes its editorial with the following words:



“The German Government is endeavouring to preserve the inner
unity of Germany and sow discord among the Allies. Our
’Pravdists’ are making every effort to undermine unity in
revolutionary Russia and to set the Russian Government upon the
governments of our Allies, Britain and France. Are we not
entitled to say that the Lenin crew is working for von
Bethmann-Hollweg and Wilhelm  II?”



No, gentlemen of the capitalist fold, you are not entitled to
say it. It is we Pravdists, and we alone, who, far from
preserving the inner unity of Germany, are, on the contrary,
actually engaged in destroying it.


This is a fact which no lies of the Russian capitalists can ever
obliterate.


It is a fact that we Pravdists, and we alone, demand that the
German socialists should unconditionally and immediately break
with the German Plekhanovs, i.e., the Scbeidemanns, and with the
German ’Centre’, i.e., those vacillating people who cannot make
up their minds to break away, definitely, on principle, from the
Scheidemanns.


It is a fact that we Pravdists, and we alone, stand for unity
with only two German socialist groups (the Spartacus
and the Arbeiterpolitik) which support the policy of Karl
Liebknecht, i.e., the policy ol destroying the inner
unity of Germany. The policy of Karl Liebknecht, a policy
of deeds, not words, is to destroy the ’inner unity’ of
the capitalists and workers in Germany.


Clearly realising that the German capitalists and their Wilhelm
are imperialists, i.e., brigands, Karl Liebknecht

    

as far back as
September 1915 sent a letter to the Zimmerwald
Conference, which was not published, because Liebknecht was then
still a legal person. But everyone who was at Zimmerwald knew
about this letter.


The letter called, not for a civil truce, but for a civil war.


That was how our comrade-in-idea, Karl Liebknecht,
preached ’inner unity’ in Germany. That is what we ourselves
have preached in the German translation of our Pravdist pamphlet
Socialism and War (by Zinoviev and
Lenin).[1]


Karl Liebknecht not only spoke this way, he acted this way. From
the platform of the German parliament, he called upon the German
soldiers to turn their guns against their own German
Government. Then he joined a street demonstration with
revolutionary proclamations reading: ’Down with the Government.’


That is how Karl Liebknecht, an adherent of our Pravdist policy,
has been ’endeavouring to preserve the inner unity of
Germany’. That is why he has been thrown into a convict prison.


And Karl Liebknecht is denounced as a Judas and a traitor not
only by the entire press of the German capitalists, but by all
the papers of the German Plekhanovs, who accuse him more or less
directly of treason or anarchism.


In all countries the capitalists are spewing out a
torrent of lies, slander, abuse and accusations of treason
against those socialists who are behaving the way Karl
Liebknecht is behaving in Germany, or the way the Pravdists are
behaving in Russia, i.e., who are destroying the ’inner
unity’ between the workers and the capitalists, the workers and
the Plekhanovs,
the workers and the ’Centrists’
in every country, and who are creating unity among
the workers of all countries in order to put an end to the
predatory, murderous imperialist war, in order to rid mankind of
the yoke of capitalism.


In Germany the capitalists are hounding Karl Liebknecht and his
friends as traitors. In Germany, too, our comrade Karl
Liebknecht has been repeatedly threatened with mob
violence. This has been mentioned even by that German Plekhanov,
the social-chauvinist David. In Russia the

    

capitalists hound the
Pravdists as traitors. In Britain the capitalists hound the
Scotch public school-teacher MacLean as a traitor. He, too, has
been thrown into a convict prison for the same kind of
crime, for the same kind of ’treason’ as that which Karl
Liebknecht and we Pravdists are guilty of.


In France the republican capitalist government is keeping in
prison the Frenchman Content and the Russian Rayev for issuing a
proclamation entitled ’Impose peace’.


Gentlemen of Rech, ministers, members of the
revolutionary government, put us Pravdists in a convict prison,
or tell the Russian people to shut us up in a convict prison!
Then you will be actually following in the footsteps of
capitalist Britain, our ’Ally’ (the ally of Tsar Nicholas II,
for it was he who concluded the treaty with the
Allies), which is keeping the British Pravdists in a convict
prison.


Down with the ’inner unity’ of the workers and capitalists in
all countries, for this ’unity’ has condemned and is
still condemning humanity to the horrors of the predatory
imperialist war waged in the interests of the capitalists!


Long live unity among those socialists and workers in
all countries who not only sympathise with Karl
Liebknecht in words, but actually pursue the Liehknecht policy
against their own capitalists!

Here is the text of the telegram from Minister Shingaryov,
mentioned in yesterday’s editorial of our paper, and printed in
today’s
Dyen[1]:



“On acquainting myself with the decision of the Ranenburg
Committee relating to the grain sowing, I deem it my duty to
declare that an independent solution of the land question in the
absence of a general state law is inadmissible. Arbitrary action
will lead to a national calamity and will jeopardies the cause
of freedom by provoking discord. The lawful solution of the land
question is the business of the Constituent Assembly. At the
present time agricultural conciliation chambers will beset up in
each local area under the rural supply committees for the
purpose of effecting voluntary agreements between the tillers of
the land and the landowners. The question of leaseholds on
vacant lands is also being urgently considered. For the sake of
general order I request that everybody be guided by the
decisions of the Provisional Government and refrain from
establishing self-made laws.’



Can you call it ’democracy’, ’people’s freedom’, when the
peasants, who clearly constitute the overwhelming
majority of the population, have no right to adopt and
carry out their own decision, but must wait for a ’voluntary
agreement’ between the tillers of the land and the
landowners?


 One landowner having two thousand dessiatines
of land—and three hundred peasant families
having two thousand dessiatines. That, on the average, is how
things stand in Russia. Three hundred peasants must wait for
the ’voluntary’ consent of one landowner!


Is this right, comrade soldiers?

Today’s Malenkaya
Gazeta[2] publishes an appeal by a group of soldiers of
the Fourth Motor Ambulance Unit to all comrades in the army,
demanding an investigation into the circumstances connected with
the passage through Germany of Lenin and others.


Here we have an honest voice standing out from the torrent of
filthy lies, foul slander, and riot-mongering agitation [See Against the Riot
Mongers]. Indeed, it is the right and duty
of every citizen to demand an investigation into any fact that
is of social importance.


Here we have an honest method of honest people, not of
riot-mongers.


And it is this method that Lenin and all the adherents of
various parties who had come with him adopted
immediately upon their arrival. They made a
report [See: How
We Arrived] of their passage to the Executive
Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies,[1]

giving the names of the socialists from two neutral
countries, Switzerland and Sweden, who had signed the official
protocol of the journey, and had examined all the
documents. The Executive Committee had Chkheidze, Tsereteli,
Skobelev, Steklov, and others on it. They decided to publish in
Izvestia both the report and the resolution of the
Executive Committee.


Following the consideration of the report it was resolved:



“Having heard the report of Comrades Zurabov and Zinoviev, the
Executive Committee decided to take the matter up immediately
with the Provisional Government and to take steps towards
securing the immediate return to Russia

    

of all emigrants,
irrespective of their political views and their attitude towards
the war.”


Both documents were published in Izvestia No. 32, for
April, 1917.


Is it fair, is it sensible not to reprint the report
and the resolution, and to conduct a riot-mongering
agitation?


Have the comrades of the Fourth Motor Ambulance Unit acted
rightly in hastening to “brand” and denounce the newly arrived
comrades as “traitors”, to heap “curses” upon them, and to
revile them without having discussed the documents
printed in Izvestia?


What is this if not anarchism, if not an appeal to defy
the members of the Executive Committee elected by the workers
and soldiers?

Most of the soldiers come from the peasantry. Every peasant
knows how the landowners have been oppressing the people. But
wherein lies the power of the landowners?


In the land.


The landowners have tens of millions of dessiatines
of land. That is why millions of peasant families have no choice
but to enslave themselves to the landowners.


No “liberties” can help the peasants so long as the landowners
are in possession of tens of millions of dessiatines of land.


All the landed estates must be taken over by the people. All the
land in the country must become the property of the whole
people, and be disposed of by the local Soviets of Peasants’ and
Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.


How is this to he accomplished? We must immediately set up all
over Russia, in every village without exception, Soviets of
Peasants’ and Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies modelled after
the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies in the
cities. Unless the peasants and agricultural labourers
themselves unite, unless they themselves take
their fate into their own hands, no one in the world will help
them, no one will free them from their bondage to the
landowners.


To enable the peasants to take over all the land from the
landowners in their own districts immediately and to dispose of
it properly, while preserving perfect order and guarding against
any damage to property, the peasants must be supported by the
soldiers.


The peasants, soldiers, and workers constitute the overwhelming
majority of the population. This majority wants
    

all the
land to pass immediately into the hands of the Soviets of
Peasants’ Deputies. No one can stop the majority, if it
is well organised (solidly united), if it is
class-conscious, if it is armed.

Soldiers! Help to unite and arm all the workers and the
peasants!

Soldiers! You, too, unite more solidly, and form closer ties
with the workers and the peasants! Do not allow your armed power
to be taken away from you!

Then, and only then, will the people get all the land, and free
themselves from their bondage to the landowners.

1
Report on the Present Situation

     And the Attitude Towards the Provisional

Government

April 14 (27)

Our political line, embodied in resolutions, was
      worked out in advance
      with far greater precision than that of any other party. Events, however,
      have created an entirely new situation. The chief mistake made by
      revolutionaries is that they look backward at the old revolutions, whereas
      life gives us too many new things that have to be fitted into the general
      pattern of events.

The motive forces of the [February]
    revolution were defined by us quite correctly. Events have justified our
    old Bolshevik premises, but the trouble with us is that comrades have
    wished to remain “old” Bolsheviks. Mass movement had been confined to the
    proletariat and the peasantry. The West-European bourgeoisie had always
    been opposed to revolution. Such was the situation to which we had been
    accustomed. But things turned out differently. The imperialist war split
    the European bourgeoisie, and this created a situation where the
    Anglo-French capitalists, for imperialist reasons, became supporters of a
    Russian revolution. The British capitalists actually entered into a
    conspiracy with Guchkov,
    Milyukov,
    and the high commanding officers of the army. The Anglo-French capitalists
    sided with the revolution. The European newspapers report many instances of
    British and French emissaries making trips to have talks with
    “revolutionaries” like Guchkov. The revolution has thus gained an
    unexpected ally. As a result, the revolution has turned out to be different
    from what anyone expected. We have found allies not only

    

in the Russian
    bourgeoisie but also among the Anglo-French capitalists. When I mentioned
    this in a lecture delivered
abroad,[1]

I was told by a Menshevik that we had
    been wrong, for events had proved that the bourgeoisie was necessary for
    the success of the revolution. I replied that it was “necessary” only
    insofar as it helped the revolution triumph in eight days. Did not Milyukov
    declare before the revolution that if victory lay through revolution, then
    he was against victory? We must not forget these words of Milyukov.

And so, the revolution in its first stage developed in a way that no one
    had expected. The Bolsheviks’ reply to the question as to the possibility
    of “defending the fatherland” was this: if a bourgeois-chauvinist
    revolution triumphed
(Sotsial-Demokrat[3]
    No. 47), then defence of the fatherland would be
impossible.[2]

The situation is unique in that
    we now have a dual power [the Contact
    Commission]. Abroad, where no paper more Left than Rech
    ever penetrates, and where the English and French bourgeois papers speak of
    an all-powerful Provisional Government and the “chaos” represented by the
    Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, nobody has any clear idea of
    this dual power. Only here on the spot did we learn that the Soviet had
    surrendered power to the Provisional Government. The Soviet is the
    implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the soldiers;
    among the latter the majority are peasants. It is therefore a dictatorship
    of the proletariat and the peasantry. But this “dictatorship” has entered
    into an agreement with the bourgeoisie. And this is where the “old”
    Bolshevism needs revising. The situation that has arisen shows that the
    dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry is interlocked with the
    power of the bourgeoisie. An amazingly unique situation. The past contains
    no instances of a revolution where the representatives of the revolutionary
    proletariat and peasantry, though fully armed, concluded an alliance with
    the bourgeoisie, and though having the power, ceded it to the bourgeoisie.
    The bourgeoisie wields the power of capital and the power of organisation.
    It is a wonder the workers have shown themselves to be as well organised as
    they are. The bourgeois

    

revolution in Russia is completed insofar as power
    has come into the hands of the bourgeoisie. Here the “old Bolsheviks”
    argue: “It is not completed–for there is no dictatorship of the
    proletariat and the peasantry.” But the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
    Deputies is that very dictatorship.

The agrarian movement can go two ways. The peasants may take the land,
    but no struggle may develop between the rural proletariat and the
    prosperous peasants. This is unlikely, however, for the class struggle does
    not wait. To repeat now what we said in 1905, and omit mention of the class
    struggle in the countryside, is a betrayal of the proletarian cause.

Already we can discern in the decisions of a number of peasant
    congresses a tendency to wait with the solution of the agrarian question
    until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly. This is a victory for
    the well-to-do peasants who lean towards the Cadets. The peasants are
    already taking possession of the land. The Socialist-Revolutionaries are
    trying to hold them back, suggesting that they wait until the Constituent
    Assembly meets. We must combine the demand for the immediate seizure of the
    land with propaganda for the setting up of Soviets of Agricultural
    Labourers’ Deputies. The bourgeois-democratic revolution is completed. The
    agrarian programme must be carried out in a new way. The same struggle for
    power that is going on here between the large and small proprietors will
    take place in the village too. The peasants will not be content with !and
    alone. The number of horseless peasants has increased greatly. We alone are
    at present developing the agrarian revolution, when we tell the peasants to
    take the land immediately. The land must be taken in an organised manner.
    Property must not be damaged. The agrarian movement, consequently, is only
    a prevision, and not a fact. It is the task of Marxists to make the
    question of an agrarian programme clear to the peasants; the weight of
    emphasis on this issue must be shifted to the Soviet of Agricultural
    Labourers’ Deputies. We must be prepared, however, for the peasantry
    uniting with the bourgeoisie, just as the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
    Deputies has done. It follows that the agrarian movement still has to be
    developed. The well-to-do peasantry will, naturally, gravitate towards the
    bourgeoisie,

    

towards the Provisional Government. It may prove even more
    Right than Guchkov.

For the time being, the victory of bourgeois power is an accomplished
    fact. The economic position of the peasants separates them from the
    landowners. What the peasants need is not a legal right to the land. They
    need Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies. Those who advise the
    peasants to wait until the Constituent Assembly meets are deceiving
    them.

Our task is to separate the class line from this petty-bourgeois bog.
    The bourgeoisie does its job splendidly; it makes all sorts of promises,
    but in effect pursues only its class policy.

In the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies the alignment of
    forces is such that power is passed to the Provisional Government, while
    the socialists content themselves with “contact commissions”. True, this
    government is composed of the most trusted and best people of their class,
    but still of a definite class. The petty bourgeoisie has surrendered to
    them completely. Unless we mark out a proletarian line, we shall be
    betraying the cause of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie rules either by
    deception or by violence. Just now flattery and deception prevail, and this
    lulls the revolution. The bourgeoisie makes concessions on minor issues,
    but in matters of primary importance (the agrarian revolution, for example)
    they make none. One must be blind to the facts not to see that in Russia,
    apart from the Bolsheviks, there is nothing but revolutionary defencism,
    and that it has triumphed everywhere. Revolutionary defencism means the
    surrender of all socialist principles in the predatory interests of
    capitalism, interests which are screened behind the phrase “defence of the
    fatherland”; it means surrendering one’s positions to the petty
    bourgeoisie. When I spoke of the “honest” mass of revolutionary defencists,
    I had in mind not a moral category, but a class definition. The classes
    represented in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies have no
    interest in the predatory war, in Europe it is different. There the people
    are oppressed, and the most opportunistic pacifists are often hounded worse
    than we Pravdists are. In our country the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
    Deputies pursues its policy of revolutionary defencism, not by

    

violence,
    but because the masses trust it. Europe is one vast military prison.
    Capitalism rules cruelly there. All over Europe the bourgeoisie should be
    overthrown, and not argued with. In Russia the soldiers are armed; by
    agreeing only to “defend themselves” against Wilhelm they allowed them
    selves to be peacefully deceived. In Europe, there is no “honest”
    revolutionary defencism like we have in Russia, where the people have
    handed over the power to the bourgeoisie through ignorance, inertia,
    tradition, and the habit of suffering the rod. Steklov and Chkheidze are
    leaders in word, but tailpieces of the bourgeoisie in deed; for all their
    virtues, their knowledge of Marxism, etc., they are politically dead. Here
    in Russia the power is in the hands of the soldiers, who are
    defencist-minded. The objective class position of the capitalists is one
    thing. They are conducting the war in their own interests. The soldiers are
    proletarians and peasants. This is another thing. Are they interested in
    seizing Constantinople? No, their class interests are opposed to war! That
    is why they can be made to see light, made to change their minds. The crux
    of the political situation at this moment is to be able to make the masses
    see the truth. We cannot talk about having the “backing” of the
    revolutionary mass, etc., until we have brought home to the soldiers or to
    the uneducated masses the meaning of the slogan “Down with war”.

What is the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies? Its class meaning
    is direct power. We do not have complete political liberty, of course. But
    nowhere else is there such freedom as exists in Russia today. “Down with
    war” does not mean flinging the bayonet away. It means the transfer of
    power to another class. Everything must now be focused on making that
    clear. Blanquism was a striving to seize power with the backing of a
    minority. With us it is quite different. We are still a minority and
    realise the need for winning a majority. Unlike the anarchists, we need the
    state for the transition to socialism. The Paris Commune furnished an
    example of a state of the Soviet type, an example of direct power wielded
    by the organised and armed workers, an example of the dictatorship of
    workers and peasants. The role of the Soviets, the significance of such a
    dictatorship, is that they apply organised force against the
    counter-revolution,

safeguard the gains of the revolution for the benefit
    of the majority and with the support of the majority. There can be no dual
    power in a state. The Soviets are a type of state where the existence of a
    police is impossible. Here the people are their own rulers, and there can
    be no return to the monarchy. The army and the people must merge into one_
    therein lies the triumph of liberty! Everyone must learn to use arms. To
    safeguard freedom, all the people to a man must be armed. This is the
    essence of the commune. We are not anarchists who deny the need for an
    organised state, i.e., for force in general, particularly a state
    maintained by the organised and armed workers themselves through the
    Soviets. Events have led to the dictatorship of the proletariat and
    peasantry being interlocked with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The
    next stage is the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the proletariat is
    not yet sufficiently organised and enlightened; it must be enlightened.
    Such Soviets of Workers’ and other Deputies should be organised all over
    the country life itself demands it. There is no other way. This is the
    Paris Commune! The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is not an organisation of
    the trade union type, as the bourgeoisie would like it to be. The people
    see it differently and more correctly they see it as a government power.
    They see that the way out of the war lies through the victory of the Soviet
    of Workers’ Deputies. This is the type of state under which it is possible
    to advance towards socialism. Should a group seize power, it would not mean
    much. The Russian revolution has risen higher: any government other than
    the Soviet is impossible, and this is what the bourgeoisie fears. So long
    as the Soviets have not seized power, we shall not take it. A living force,
    however, must impel the Soviets to seize power. Otherwise we shall never
    get out of the war which the capitalists are carrying on by deceiving the
    people. All countries are on the brink of ruin; people must realise this;
    there is no way out except through a socialist revolution. The government
    must be overthrown, but not everybody understands this correctly. So long
    as the Provisional Government has the backing of the Soviet of Workers’
    Deputies, you cannot “simply” overthrow it. The only way it can and must be
    overthrown is by winning over the majority in the Soviets. It is either
    forward towards

    

the undivided power of the Soviets of Workers’ and
    Soldiers’ Deputies, or back to the imperialist war–there is no other
    alternative. Kautsky denied that a revolution was possible in time of war.
    Events have shown him to be wrong.

As regards nationalisation of the banks and control over them–economically this is feasible, economically nothing can interfere with it,
    once the power is in the hands of the workers. Obviously, in viewing the
    tasks of the proletariat as we do, there can be no question of any alliance
    with the “defencists”.

Concerning a new name for the Party: the word “Social-Democracy” is
    incorrect; it is scientifically wrong. Marx and Engels said as much on many
    occasions. If they “put up with” the word, it was because after the year
    1871 a special situation was created: a slow preparation of the
    masses was needed, revolution was not on the order of the day. Democracy,
    too, means a form of state, but the Paris Commune had risen above it. Now
    the whole world is faced with the practical issue–that of the
    transition to socialism. The Social-Democrat Plekhanov and the rest of the
    social-chauvinists throughout the world have betrayed socialism. We should
    call ourselves the “Communist Party”.

      Concluding Remarks In The Debate

      Concerning The Report On The Present Situation

April 14 (27))
    

The discussion has shown that opinion is divided. I cannot
      answer all the questions.


The question of old Bolshevism. Kalinin defended old
      Bolshevism. But he also came to the conclusion that our present
      tactics were correct. Another opinion is that there is a marked
      tendency towards the tactics of the petty bourgeoisie.


There is a time-honoured expression: to go through with the
      revolution. But which revolution? The objective situation in
      1905 was this: the proletariat and the peasantry were the only
      revolutionary element, while the Cadets stood for the
      monarchy. Now defencism represents the adoption by the peasants
      of petty-bourgeois tactics. Going through with the revolution
      under these circumstances has no meaning. The revolution has
      united the petty bourgeoisie with other revolutionary elements
      upon the ground of defencism.


The future of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the
      peasantry. A petty-bourgeois peasantry holding defencist views
      may even be in favour of a monarchy.


A new line follows from the policy of Bolshevism. The petty
      bourgeoisie and the big bourgeoisie have united. We take as our
      point of departure conflicting class interests. The labourer
      peasants ought to be against the imperialist war. The proprietor
      peasants are for defencism.


Defencism has shown that the petty bourgeoisie has moved away
      from the working class and gone over to the big bourgeoisie.

    

The
      poor peasant who earns a part of his living in the city has no
      need for this war. This class ought to be opposed to the
      war.


Old Bolshevism should be discarded. The line of the petty
      bourgeoisie must be separated from that of the wage-earning
      proletariat. Fine phrases about the revolutionary people are
      suitable to a man like Kerensky, but not to the revolutionary
      proletariat. To be revolutionaries, even democrats, with
      Nicholas removed, is no great merit. Revolutionary democracy is
      no good at all; it is a mere phrase. It covers up rather than
      lays bare the antagonisms of class interests. A Bolshevik must
      open the eyes of the workers and peasants to the existence of
      these antagonisms, not gloss them over. If the imperialist war
      hits the proletariat and the peasants economically, these
      classes will have to rise against it.


To create a network of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and
      Peasants’ Deputies—that is our task today. The whole of
      Russia is already being covered with a network of organs of
      local self-government. A commune may exist also in the form of
      organs of self-government. The abolition of the police and the
      standing army, and the arming of the whole people—all
      this can be accomplished through the organs of local
      self-government. I have taken the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies
      simply because it already exists.


It is said, we must “interest” the proletariat. This is what
      Chkheidze, the Provisional Government and others are doing when
      they use high-sounding words about revolutionary democracy. A
      Bolshevik must differentiate between the proletariat and the
      petty bourgeoisie, and leave such words as “revolutionary
      democracy” and “revolutionary people” to Kerensky. Democracy in
      Russia is imperialistic. It is argued that we are reducing our
      activities to cultural work. That is not true. Passing
      resolutions about the Constituent Assembly, etc., would mean
      “interesting” the proletariat.


The real work is to bring about the abolition of the standing
      army, the bureaucracy, and the police, and to arm the whole
      people.


The Constituent Assembly will not kill the revolution, for
      nothing is heard of it now, and no one is planning to

    

convene
      it. We leave it to the Socialist-Revolutionaries to “demand” its
      convocation.


This war is a world war. It is waged by definite classes, and
      was brought on by banking capital. It can be stopped by
      transferring power to another class. So long as the power
      remains in the hands of the ruling classes, peace can alter
      nothing.


The proletariat must be shown how the revolution can be carried
      forward by concrete measures. To carry the revolution forward
      means to achieve self-government by independent action. The
      growth of democracy does not stand in the way of
      self-government, it helps us to realise our aims, The war can be
      terminated only by the transfer of power to another
      class—and Russia has come closest of all to that—but
      never by a
      truce among the capitalists of all countries on the basis of an
      exchange of subjugated nationalities. A commune is quite
      suitable to the peasantry. A commune means complete
      self-government, the absence of any supervision from
      above. Nine-tenths of the peasantry should be for it.


The bourgeoisie may reconcile itself to the nationalisation of
      the land, should the peasants take over the land. As a
      proletarian party, we must declare that the land alone will not
      feed people. To cultivate it one will therefore have to set up
      the commune. We must be for centralisation, but there are times
      when things can best be done locally; we should allow a maximum
      of initiative in the local areas. The Cadets are already acting
      like officials. They tell the peasants: “Wait for the
      Constituent Assembly.” Our Party alone provides slogans that
      really carry the revolution forward. The Soviets of Workers’
      Deputies are fully capable of establishing communes in the local
      areas. The question is whether the proletariat will be well
      enough organised for the task, but this is a thing we cannot
      estimate in advance, we must learn by doing.


Trotskyism: “No tsar, but a workers’ government.” This is
      wrong. A petty bourgeoisie exists, and it cannot be
      dismissed. But it is in two parts. The poorer of the two is with
      the working class.


War. To end the war by pacifist means is utopia. It may be
      terminated by an imperialist peace. But the masses do

    

not want
      such a peace. War is a continuation of the policies of a class;
      to change the character of the war one must change the class in
      power.


The name Communist Party is theoretically sound. The Left
      socialists of other countries are too weak. We must take the
      initiative.

      Two Remarks During the Debate

      On the Resolution Concerning the Attitude

Towards the Provisional Government

April 15 (28)
    

I.


After yesterday’s debate I can confine myself to brief
      remarks. The resolution shows a way out. The situation is
      determined not only by the fact that definite classes are
      represented in the Provisional Government, but also by the fact
      that the latter leans upon the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies. The
      inference is not that we must yield to this petty bourgeoisie,
      but that we must form independent groups, not in order to
      separate ourselves from the petty bourgeoisie, but in order to
      impel it to go forward. The seizure of all the land is a step
      forward on the part of the revolutionary people. The replacement
      of the standing army by a militia is a step forward.


II.


Comrade Kamenev is shifting to the policy of Chkheidze and
      Steklov. Of course, no one will say that the Provisional
      Government is putting off the Constituent Assembly, if we do not
      say it. Everybody wants to carry on the war. The point at issue
      is the organisation of counter-revolution. In revolutionary
      times control means deception. The date for the elections could
      be arranged in three days. By

    

listing “sins”, we provide
      ammunition for propaganda. To seek the truth in the Contact
      Commission is impossible. There can be no control without
      power. To control by means of resolutions, etc., is sheer
      nonsense. Control means dispelling the petty-bourgeois
      illusions, fog.

      Resolution

on the Attitude Towards

the Provisional Government
    

Considering:


      (1) that the Provisional Government, by its class character, is
          the organ of landowner and bourgeois domination;


      (2) that the Provisional Government and the classes it
          represents are bound with indissoluble economic and
          political ties to Russian and Anglo-French imperialism;


      (3) that the Provisional Government is carrying out its
          proclaimed programme only partially, and only under pressure of the revolutionary proletariat and, to some extent,
          of the petty bourgeoisie;


      (4) that the forces of bourgeois and landowner counter
          revolution, now being organised, have already, under cover
          of the Provisional Government and with the latter’s obvious
          connivance, launched an attack on revolutionary
          democracy;


      (5) that the Provisional Government is avoiding fixing the date
          for the elections to the Constituent Assembly, preventing
          the arming of the people as a whole, opposing the transfer
          of all the land to the people, foisting upon it the
          landowners’ way of settling the agrarian question,
          obstructing the introduction of an eight-hour workday,
          condoning counter-revolutionary propaganda in the army (by
          Guchkov and Co.), rallying the high-ranking officers against
          the soldiers, etc.;


      (6) that this government, at the same time, is relying at
          present on the confidence of, and, to a certain extent, on
          an actual agreement with, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’

    

          and Soldiers’ Deputies, which now unites an obvious majority
          of workers and soldiers, i.e., peasants;


      (7) that every step of the Provisional Government, in both its
          domestic and foreign policies, is bound to open the eyes,
          not only of the proletarians in town and country and
          semi-proletarians, but also of the broad sections of the
          petty bourgeoisie, to the real nature of this
          government,


the Conference resolves that:


      (1) in order to ensure all the state power passing into the
          hands of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies or
          other bodies directly expressing the will of the people,
          prolonged work is necessary to develop proletarian class-
          consciousness and to unite the urban and rural proletarians
          against the vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie, for only
          work of this nature can guarantee real advance on the part
          of the whole revolutionary people;


      (2) this calls for many-sided activity within the Soviets of
          Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, for work aimed at
          increasing the number of these Soviets, consolidating their
          power, and welding together our Party’s proletarian
          internationalist groups in the Soviets;


      (3) we must organise our Social-Democratic forces more
          effectively, so as to be able to direct the new wave of the
          revolutionary movement under the banner of revolutionary
          Social-Democracy.

      Two Remarks During the Debate

      On the Question of the Municipal Elections
    

      I.


Since we have proportional representation, there is no need for
      a bloc; the minority is protected. I emphatically disagree with
      Comrade Kalinin, because a bloc with the petty bourgeoisie, with
      the chauvinists, is unthinkable. The very idea of a bloc with
      the petty bourgeoisie, who are supported by the capitalists, is
      a betrayal of socialism. With whom are we to form blocs, with
      the editors of
Internatsional[1]? But this paper has not
      been published yet, and therefore we do not know them. Chkheidze
      is defencism’s worst mask. Trotsky, when editing his paper in
      Paris, never made it clear whether he was for or against
      Chkheidze. We have always spoken against Chkheidze, because he
      is a subtle mask for chauvinism. Trotsky has never made himself
      clear. How do we know that Larin, the editor of
      Internatsional, does not follow the same tactics?


We must come forward with a definite programme. A struggle is
      now on among three parties: the first is the party of robbers
      and killers; the second is the party that shields these robbers
      with fine words, and finally, the third party, the party that
      refuses to support the robbers and stands for exposing the
      mistakes made by everybody, the Executive Committee of the
      Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies included.


The fault of the Soviet is not that it didn’t assume power, but
      that it teaches the people the wrong things, it shouts about its
      victory over the government.

    


II.


I am decidedly in favour of placing on our tickets the names of
      the Menshevik candidates who are breaking with chauvinism. This
      is no bloc. As far as parties are concerned, Russia is
      remarkably well organised. About a programme: the question of a
      paid militia, the question of food supply, the question of
      taxes—all these are important.

[1]
An advance announcement of the publication of the weekly journal
      Intertsational
      was published in Rabochaya Gazeta on April 16
      (29), 1917.  The first issue appeared on April 18(31), and on
      April 22 (May 5) Lenin had apparently had not yet seen it.

      The title page held a notice to the effect that pending the
      arrival of L. Martov the journal was edited by Y.  Larin. The
      list of contributors included L. Martov, Y. Larin, P. B.
      Axelrod and G. 0. Binshtok. In the first issue the editors
      proclaimed the conciliatory slogan of bringing pressure to bear
      on the Provisional Government to meet the demands of the
      proletariat in domestic and foreign policies. The third issue of
      the journal (for June 1917) was its last.  In August 1917 some
      of the journal’s contributors headed by Y. Larin broke with the
      Mensheviks and joined the ranks of the Bolshevik Party.

      Resolution on the Municipal Question
    

Under no circumstances can the municipal platform, particularly
      at the present revolutionary time, be reduced only to communal
      questions.


It must also contain a definite answer to all present-day key
      issues, especially those concerning the war and the tasks of the
      proletariat in regard to the central power.


Even in municipal questions, such as that of the militia, food
      supply, housing, and taxes, we cannot expect the petty-bourgeois
      parties to agree to revolutionary measures necessary to combat
      war and its consequences.


For all these reasons we must go to the elections without blocs,
      upon a straight issue of principles announced in the programme
      of the proletarian party, and explain to the people the
      fundamental differences between the three main party divisions,
      namely,(1) the Cadets and those to the right of them; (2) the
      parties of the petty bourgeoisie (Narodniks) and a section of
      workers who have fallen under the influence of the bourgeoisie
      (the Menshevik defencists); (3) the party of the revolutionary
      proletariat (the Bolsheviks).


The technical arrangements for the elections based on the system
      of proportional representation make blocs technically
      unnecessary.


It is advisable in every way to encourage closer relations and
      mutual exchange of opinions, on the basis of practical work,
      with those Mensheviks who are really breaking with revolutionary
      defencism and with support of the Provisional Government. With
      such comrades it is permissible to run a joint ticket, on
      condition that there be sufficient agreement on fundamentals. A
      concrete municipal programme should be worked out, particularly
      on the question of a proletarian militia to be laid for by the
      capitalists.

      Draft Resolution on the Attitude Towards the

Parties of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries,

the Menshevik Social-Democrats,

the
      “Non-Faction” Social-Democrats

and other Kindred Political Trends


Taking into consideration:


      (1) that the parties of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Menshevik
          Social-Democrats, etc., have, in the great majority of
          cases, adopted the stand of “revolutionary defencism” and
          voted for the loan, that is, in support of the imperialist
          war waged by the imperialist government of the
          capitalists—Guchkov, Lvov and Co.;


      (2) that these parties are supporting the Provisional
          Government, which represents the interests of Capital and
          which has taken a counter-revolutionary stand in domestic as
          well as foreign policy;


      (3) that these parties have allowed themselves to be deceived by
          the capitalists, and, in their turn, are deceiving the
          people with false hopes of being able, by means of “demands”
          and “control” of the Provisional Government, and without
          wielding state power, to change the class nature of the
          government of the capitalists and wean it away from the
          imperialist policy now needed by the capitalists and from
          counter-revolutionary attempts against liberty;


      (4) that the resultant attempt to obscure the class
          consciousness of the proletarians and semi-proletarians,
          which these parties are encouraging, is, in view of the
          general attitude of unreasoning trust on the part of the
          masses to wards the capitalists, who are now acting chiefly
          by deception and flatterys the principal reason for the
          revolution

    

hanging fire and for its possible defeat by the
          forces of the landowner and bourgeois counter-revolution,


the Conference resolves that:


      (1) the voting in favour of the loan and advocacy of
          revolutionary defencism ill general be considered a gross
          betrayal of socialism, of the proletarian class struggle and
          of the principles of internationalism, i.e., the fraternal
          union of the workers of all countries against the
          capitalists of all countries;


      (2) the above-named parties be considered as acting in the
          interests and upholding the point of view of the petty
          bourgeoisie and corrupting the proletariat with bourgeois
          influence;


      (3) unity with parties, as a whole, which are pursuing a policy
          of support for the Provisional Government, are advocating
          revolutionary defencism, etc., be considered absolutely
          impossible in view of the fact that these parties have
          abandoned the proletarian class position for a
          petty-bourgeois position;


      (4) in regard to certain local groups of workers who are aligned
          with the Mensheviks, etc., but who strive to uphold the
          position of internationalism against “revolutionary
          defencism” and against voting for the loan, etc., the policy
          of our Party should be to support such workers and groups,
          to seek closer relations with them, and support unity with
          them on the basis of a definite break with the
          petty-bourgeois betrayal of socialism.

      Draft Resolution on the War
    

      I
    

The present war is, on the part of both groups of the
      belligerent powers, an imperialist war, i.e., one waged by the
      capitalists for world domination, for division of the
      capitalists’ spoils, for profitable markets for finance and
      banking capital, and for the subjugation of the weaker
      nationalities.


The transfer of state power in Russia from Nicholas II to the
      [provisional] government of Guchkov,
      Lvov, and others, to the government of the landowners and
      capitalists, did not and could not alter the class character and
      meaning of the war as far as Russia is concerned.


The fact that the new government is carrying on the same
      imperialist war, i.e., an aggressive war of conquest, became
      glaringly apparent when the government not only failed to
      publish the secret treaties between ex-Tsar Nicholas II and the
      capitalist governments of Britain, France, etc., but even
      formally confirmed these treaties. This was done without
      consulting the will of the people and with the express purpose
      of deceiving them, for it is well known that the secret treaties
      concluded by the ex-tsar are outrageously predatory treaties
      that give the Russian capitalists a free hand to rob China,
      Persia, Turkey, Austria, etc.


For this reason no proletarian party that does not wish to break
      completely with internationalism, i.e., with the fraternal
      solidarity of the workers of all countries in their struggle
      against the yoke of Capital, can support the

    

present war, or the
      present government, or its loans, no matter in what glowing
      terms these loans may be described.


Nor can any trust be placed in the present government’s promise
      to renounce annexations, i.e., the conquest of foreign countries
      or the forcible retention of any nationality within the confines
      of Russia. For, in the first place, the capitalists, bound
      together by the thousand threads of Russian and Anglo-French
      banking capital, and intent on protecting the interests of
      capital, cannot renounce annexations in this war without at the
      same time ceasing to be capitalists, without renouncing the
      profits from the thou sands of millions invested in loans,
      concessions, war industries, etc. And secondly, the new
      government, after renouncing annexations to mislead the people,
      declared through Milyukov (Moscow, April 9, 1917) that it had no
      intention of renouncing them. Finally, as revealed by Dyelo
      Naroda, a newspaper in which Minister Kerensky co-operates,
      Milyukov has not even sent his statement on the renunciation of
      annexations to other countries.


Therefore, in warning the people against the capitalists’ empty
      promises, the Conference declares that it is necessary to make a
      clear distinction between a renunciation of annexations in word
      and a renunciation of annexations in deed, i.e., the immediate
      publication of all the secret predatory treaties, of all acts of
      foreign policy, and the taking of immediate steps to fully
      liberate all peoples who are being oppressed, kept bound to
      Russia by force or kept in a state of subjection by the
      capitalist class, which is continuing the policy of ex-Tsar
      Nicholas II, a policy that is a disgrace to our nation.


      II


The “revolutionary defencism”, which in Russia has now permeated
      almost all the Narodnik parties (the Popular Socialists,
      Trudoviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries), the opportunist party of
      the Menshevik Social-Democrats (the Organising Committee,
      Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.), and the majority of the non-party
      revolutionaries, reflects, in point of class significance, the
      interests and point of view of the petty bourgeoisie, the small
      proprietors, and the well-to-do

    

peasants, who, like the
      capitalists, profit by oppressing weak peoples. On the other
      hand, it is a result of the deception of the masses by the
      capitalists, who instead of publishing the secret treaties
      confine themselves to promises and glib talk.


It must be admitted that the great mass of “revolutionary
      defencists” are honest, i.e., they are really opposed
      to annexations, to conquests, to oppressing weak peoples; they
      are really working for a democratic non-coercive peace
      among all the belligerents. This must be admitted for
      the reason that the class position of the urban and rural
      proletarians and semi-proletarians (i.e., of the people who earn
      their living, wholly or partly, by selling their labour-power to
      the capitalists) makes these classes uninterested in capitalist
      profits.


Therefore, while recognising that any concessions to
      “revolutionary defencism” are absolutely impermissible and
      virtually signify a complete break with internationalism and
      socialism, the Conference declares that our Party will preach
      abstention from violence as long as the Russian capitalists and
      their Provisional Government confine themselves to threats of
      violence against the people (for example, Guchkov’s unhappily
      notorious decree threatening the soldiers with punishment for
      arbitrary displacement of superiors), as long as the capitalists
      have not started using violence against the Soviets of
      Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, Agricultural Labourers’, and
      other Deputies, which organise themselves freely, and freely
      elect and dismiss all public officers. Our Party will
      fight against the profound and fatal error of “revolutionary
      defencism” solely by means of comradely persuasion, bringing
      home the truth that the attitude of unreasoning trust of the
      broad masses in the government of the capitalists, who are the
      worst enemies of peace and socialism, is, in present-day Russia,
      the chief obstacle to a speedy termination of the war.


      III


As for that most important issue of all, namely, how to end the
      war—a criminal, predatory capitalist war that has brought
      mankind to the brink of ruin, famine and destruction—as

    

      quickly as possible, by a truly democratic, non-coercive peace,
      the Conference recognises and declares the following:


It is utterly senseless to suppose that this war can be ended by
      a unilateral refusal of the soldiers of any one country
      to continue the war, by a unilateral cessation, of military
      operations, by the mere act of “sticking the bayonet into the
      ground”.


Our Party will patiently but persistently explain to the people
      the truth that wars are waged by governments, that wars
      are always indissolubly bound up with the policies of definite
      classes, and, therefore, this war, started by crowned brigands,
      by monarchs like Nicholas II, and by uncrowned
      brigands—the capitalists, can be terminated by a truly
      democratic,
      non-coercive peace only when the entire state power
      passes to a class that is really not interested in safe
      guarding capitalist profits, to the class of the proletarians
      and semi-proletarians, which is really capable of putting an end
      to the oppressive rule of Capital.


This class alone is capable of really renouncing
      annexations, of breaking free from the meshes of finance and
      banking capital, and, under certain circumstances, not merely in
      word but In deed, converting this predatory war into a
      revolutionary proletarian war, a war aimed, not at crushing weak
      peoples, but to free the workers and peasants of the whole
      world from the yoke of Capital.


The Conference reiterates its protests against the base slander
      spread by the capitalists against our Party to the effect that
      we are in favour of a separate peace with Germany. We consider
      the German capitalists to be as predatory as the Russian,
      British, French, and other capitalists, and Emperor Wilhelm II
      to be as bad a crowned brigand as Nicholas II or the British,
      Italian, Rumanian, and all other monarchs. We have proclaimed
      this view of our Party not only in Russian but also in German,
      in the translation of Zinoviev’s and Lenin’s pamphlet
      Socialism and
War.[1]


Moreover, as editors of the Central Organ of our Party, and in
      the name of the Party, the above-named comrades had declared
      (Sotsial-Demokrat, Geneva, October 13, 1915

    

No. 47)
      that if the revolution placed our Party in power while the war
      was still on, we would forthwith propose openly to Germany,
      together with all the other nations, a non-coercive,
      i.e., democratic, peace, and that in the event of the
      German, British, French and other capitalists declining such a
      peace, we would ourselves start a revolutionary war,
      and call upon the workers of all countries to join
us.[2]


The Conference fully endorses this declaration.


The Conference takes cognisance of the fact that in no other
      belligerent country in the world is there such freedom as there
      now is in Russia, or such revolutionary mass organisations as
      the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other
      Deputies; and that nowhere else in the world, therefore, can the
      transfer of the entire state power to the actual
      majority of the people, i.e., to the workers and poor peasants,
      be achieved so easily and so peacefully. 


The Conference declares that the money for the soldiers’ upkeep
      should be raised not by loans, which only enrich the
      capitalists, but by imposing high income and property taxes on
      the capitalists.


The Conference declares that so long as the majority of the
      people, though enjoying complete freedom of agitation and
      propaganda, have not yet come to realise how closely this war is
      bound up with capitalist interests, there is only one practical
      means of bringing this butchery of peoples to a speedy end.


This means is fraternisation at the front.


The Conference calls attention to the fact that even Novaye
      Vremya, that servile mouthpiece of the capitalist
      interests, admits in a telegram from Kiev dated April 12 that
      fraternisation has started at the front. Numerous reports from
      soldier delegates to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies in Petrograd confirm this.


By starting to fraternise, the Russian and German soldiers, the
      proletarians and peasants of both countries dressed in soldiers’
      uniforms, have proved to the whole world that intuitively the
      classes oppressed by the capitalists have discovered the right
      road to the cessation of the butchery of peoples.

 

By fraternisation we understand, first, the publication of
      proclamations in the Russian and the German languages for
      distribution at the front; second, the holding of meetings
      between the Russian and the German soldiers at the front with
      the aid of interpreters, these to be arranged in such a way that
      the capitalists, and the generals and officers of both
      countries, who for the most part are of the capitalist class,
      will not dare to interfere with these meetings, will not dare
      even to attend them without the direct and special permission of
      the soldiers,


These proclamations and meetings must make clear the
      above-stated views on war and peace, must bring home the fact
      that if the state power in the two countries, Germany and
      Russia, were to pass wholly and exclusively into the hands of
      the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the whole of
      humanity would heave a sigh of relief, for then we would really
      be assured of a speedy termination of the war, of a really
      lasting, truly democratic peace among all the nations, and, at
      the same time, the transition of all countries to socialism.

      [ Description
      of the Congress ]


A Congress of representatives of peasants’ organisations and
      Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, who have met to draw up
      regulations for the convocation of an All-Russia Soviet of
      Peasants’ Deputies and to set up similar local Soviets, has been
      in session in the Taurida Palace since April 13.


According to Dyelo Naroda, representatives from more
      than 20 gubernias
      are attending the Congress.


Resolutions have been adopted urging the need for the speediest
      organisation of the “peasantry” from bottom to “top”. “Soviets
      of Peasants’ Deputies functioning in the various areas” have
      been declared to be the “best form of organisation of the
      peasantry”.


Bykhovsky, a member of the provisional bureau for the
      convocation of tile present Congress, has pointed out that a
      decision to organise the peasantry by setting up an All-Russia
      Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies had been taken by the Moscow
      Co-operative
Congress,[2] representing an organised membership
      of twelve million, or fifty million of the population.


This is an undertaking of tremendous importance, which must be
      given every support. If it is carried out without delay, if the
      peasantry, in spite of Shingaryov, takes over all the land
      immediately by a majority decision and not by “voluntary
      agreement” with the landowners as he would have it, then not
      only the soldiers, who would receive more bread and meat, but
      also the cause of freedom would gain by it.


For the organisation of the peasants, carried out from below
      without the officials and without the “control and Supervision”
      of the landowners and their hangers-on, is the only reliable
      pledge of success for the revolution, for freedom,

    

for the
      liberation of Russia from the yoke and bondage of the
      landowners.


There is no doubt that all members of our Party, all class-
      conscious workers, will do their utmost to support the
      organisation of Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, will see to it
      that their numbers are increased and their strength
      consolidated, and will exert every effort to work inside these
      Soviets along consistent and strictly proletarian class
      lines.


To carry on this work, it is necessary to organise separately
      the proletarian elements (agricultural labourers, day-labourers,
      etc.) within the general peasant Soviets, or (sometimes
      and) set up separate Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’
      Deputies.


Our object is not to scatter forces; on the contrary, in order
      to strengthen and broaden the movement, we must arouse the
      “lowest”—to use the terminology of the
      landowners and capitalists—section of society, or, more
      correctly, class.


To build up the movement, we must free it from the Influence of
      the bourgeoisie; we must try to rid it of the inevitable
      weaknesses, vacillations, and mistakes of the petty
      bourgeoisie.


This work must be done by means of friendly persuasion, without
      anticipating events, without hurrying to “consolidate”
      organisationally that which the representatives of the rural
      proletarians and semi-proletarians have not yet fully realised,
      thought out, and digested for themselves. But it must
      be done, and a start must be made at once every where.


The practical demands and slogans, or, more properly, the
      proposals that have to be made to gain the attention of
      the peasants, should be based on vital and urgent issues.


The first issue is that of the land. The rural proletarians will
      be for the complete and immediate transfer of all the
      land without exception to the whole people, and for its being
      taken over immediately by the local committees. But you cannot
      eat land. The millions of households that have no horses,
      implements, or seeds will gain nothing from the transfer of the
      land to the “people”.


The question of continuing to run the big farms, wherever at all
      possible, as large-scale enterprises, directed by agricultural

    

      experts end the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies and
      using the best machines, seeds, and most efficient farming
      methods, must be discussed and practical measures taken without
      delay.


We cannot conceal from the peasants, least of all from the rural
      proletarians and semi-proletarians, that small-scale farming
      under commodity economy and capitalism cannot rid
      humanity of mass poverty, that it is necessary to think
      about going over to large-scale farming conducted on public
      lines and to tackle this job at once by teaching the
      masses, and in turn learning from the masses, the
      practical expedient measures for bringing about such a
      transition.


Another vital and pressing issue is that of the organisation and
      administration of the state. It is not enough to preach
      democracy, not enough to proclaim it and decree it, not enough
      to entrust the people’s “representatives” in representative
      institutions with its implementation. Democracy must be
      built at once, from below, through the initiative of
      the masses themselves, through their effective participation
      in all fields of state activity, without “supervision”
      from above, without the bureaucracy.


Replacement of the police, the bureaucracy, and the standing
      army by the universal arming of the whole people, by a universal
      militia of the entire people, women included, is a
      practical job that can and should be tackled immediately. The
      more initiative, variety, daring, and creativeness the masses
      contribute to this, the better. Not only the rural proletarians
      and semi-proletarians, but nine-tenths of the peasantry probably
      will follow us if we explain our proposals clearly, simply, and
      intelligibly by demonstrating examples and lessons from real
      life, Our proposals are:


     —not to allow the restoration of the police;


     —not to allow the restoration of the absolute powers of
      officials who, in effect, are undisplaceable and who belong to
      the landowner or capitalist class;


     —not, to allow the restoration of a standing army separated from the people, for such an army is the surest guarantee
      that attempts of all kinds will be made to stamp out freedom and
      restore the monarchy;


     —to teach the people, down to the very bottom, the art of
      government not only in theory but in practice, by beginning

    

to
      make



immediate use everywhere of the experience of the
      masses.


Democracy from below, democracy without an officialdom, without
      a police, without a standing army; voluntary social duty by a
      militia formed from a universally armed
      people—this is a guarantee of freedom which no tsars, no
      swash-buckling
      generals, and no capitalists can take away.

The newspapers for April 16 carried the following resolution:



      “Having discussed comrades’ reports concerning the spread of
      disruptive propaganda carried on under a revolutionary and often
      even under a Social-Democratic banner, particularly propaganda
      by those who call themselves Leninists; regarding such
      propaganda to be no less harmful than any other
      counter-revolutionary propaganda from the right; and realising
      at the same time that it is impossible to take repressive
      measures against propaganda so long as it remains merely
      propaganda, the Executive Commission of the Soviet of Soldiers’
      Deputies considers It essential that measures should be taken to
      counteract this propaganda by our own propaganda and
      agitation. We must make our organisations strong enough to be
      able at any moment to meet a counter-revolutionary action, no
      matter where it comes from, by effective actions of our own. We
      express our earnest wish that the Executive Committee launch a
      systematic campaign in the press, and especially in the army
      units, against the disruptive propaganda.”



If we compare this resolution with the statement made in
      Izvestia’s leading article (for April 17) against the
      “dishonourable and outrageous persecution”, we see at once the
      political division on the subject which has made itself manifest
      in practice,  namely: Russkaya Volya, the
      chief hounding agency; Mr. Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo, which
      repeats “such a method of struggle”; both recognised as such by
      Dyelo Naroda.


A different stand is taken by the Executive Commission
      of the Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies, which simply declares that
      “it is impossible to take repressive measures against propaganda
      so long as it remains merely propaganda”.

 

That is why we reprint the resolution of the Executive
      Commission in full and consider it useful to examine it on its
      merits.


The resolution declares Lenin’s propaganda to be “no less
      harmful than any other counter-revolutionary propaganda from the
      right”.


Let us examine the gist of the differences between (1)
      counter-revolutionary propaganda from the right, (2) the
      propaganda for and in support of the Provisional
      Government, and (3) our own propaganda.


The Rights are out for the overthrow of the Provisional
      Government and the restoration of the monarchy.


The Provisional Government has promised to act in
      agreement with the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies.


Our propaganda is: all power in the state to be turned over to
      the Soviets alone, because the Soviets unquestionably
      represent the overwhelming majority of the nation. To achieve
      this, we want by “explanation” (as Lenin distinctly stated in
      his
theses[1]

the very first day) to make the
      majority of the nation see the necessity for such a transfer of
      power.


The Rights, then, are for a monarchic government. The
      capitalists are for a capitalist government (for that is what
      the Provisional Government is); they promise to act in agreement
      with the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.


We want to convince the majority of the people that power must
      residesolely in the Soviets.


It is perfectly obvious that even from the point of
      view of those who advocate an agreement with the Provisional
      Government, our propaganda cannot be regarded as “no less
      harmful than any other counter-revolutionary propaganda from the
      right”. The advocates of an agreement now have the backing of
      the majority of the people! How then can they maintain that our
      propaganda urging the majority to take overall the
      power is “no less harmful than propaganda from the right”?


This is a glaring inconsistency.

 

The Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies can hardly uphold this view of
      its Executive Commission for long.


To proceed.


What essentially are our differences?


We differ mainly on three points:


      1. On the question of the land. We are for the peasants taking
         all the land immediately by a decision of their own
         majority in each locality, thus increasing production of
         grain and meat for the soldiers.


The Provisional Government is for an “agreement” between the
      peasants and the landowners, i.e., an “agreement” between three
      hundred peasants and one landowner.


The future will show whether the majority of the people are with
      us or with the Provisional Government on this question.


      2. We are for a republic where, from the bottom up, there will
         be no police, no standing army (instead of a standing army,
         we believe, there should be a universal arming of the whole
         people), no bureaucracy, who, in effect, are undisplaceable
         and privileged by high bourgeois, salaries. We want all
         public officers to be elective and displaceable at any time,
         and their pay to be on a proletarian scale.


The Provisional Government is for restoring the police of the
      usual type; it is for a standing army, for the usual kind of
      officials.


      3. The Provisional Government is for continuing the war
         and the kind of war which Nicholas the Bloody
         started. The Provisional Government is for confirming the
         secret, predatory treaties concluded by him without
         consulting the will of the people and even without making
         them public.


We are against such a war, we are against the confirmation of
      the treaties, against their non-publication.


We urge all nations, without exception, to put an end to the war
      by concluding, not a coercive, but a truly democratic peace,
      that would give freedom to all nations and nationalities. We
      want to show the people that in order to end the war by a truly
      non-coercive peace it is necessary that the state power be
      placed wholly and exclusively in the hands of the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.


For so long as the capitalists and landowners (Guchkov,
      Lvov,
      Milyukov)
      are in power, the war will remain a capitalist-directed one, all
      promises of peace without annexations

    

will remain mere promises,
      and distrust of the capitalists’ government on the part of the
      world’s working masses will continue; and that means the war
      will drag on.


Question: What if the state power in Russia passed to the
      Soviets but Germany failed to effect a revolution that
      would rid it of both Wilhelm II and the German Guchkovs
      and Milyukovs(for if the German Nicholas II were replaced by the
      German Guchkovs and Milyukovs, there would be no change whatever
      as far as the war is concerned)?


Our answer is: Power in the hands of the Soviets of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies would be the power of the majority of the
      people, and that majority consists of workers and poor
      peasants. They are really not interested in
      annexations, they will renounce them not in word, but in
      deed; they will really stop being watchdogs of the
      capitalists’ profits.


Under such conditions we too would agree to a
      revolutionary war against the capitalists of any country,
      because that would really be a war against the interests of
      Capital in general, and not a war in the interest of the
      capitalists of one particular country.


Question: How can we advance the cause of peace right now,
      immediately and practically, if it is impossible to end the war
      by simply sticking the bayonets into the ground?


Our answer is: The war cannot be terminated by the simple
      expedient of sticking the bayonets into the ground, or generally
      by the unilateral withdrawal of any of the warring
      nations. There is, and can be, only one practical and immediate
      way of hastening peace (apart from the victory of the workers’
      revolution over the capitalists), and that is the fraternisation
      of the soldiers at the front.


We must immediately, in the most energetic manner, and by all
      the means at our disposal encourage fraternisation of the
      soldiers of both warring groups at the front.


This fraternisation has already begun. Let us help it along.


These are our views. We are firmly convinced that the majority
      of the people will not say that they are “no less
      harmful than any other counter-revolutionary propaganda from the
      right”.

In its editorial of April 17, Finansovaya
      Gazeta,[1] organ of the big capitalists and banks, discloses a
      fact of stupendous importance, namely, how the parties of the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
      the Menshevik
      Social-Democrats, etc., have bound themselves hand and foot
      by tying themselves to the capitalists through their notorious
      “agreement” [the contact
      commission] with the Provisional
      Government.


Here is the full text of the article:


      THE LEFTS AND THE LOAN



The Liberty Loan issued by the Provisional Government has not
      evoked in Left-wing circles the enthusiasm that it has met with
      among the population at large.


The Left-wing press has split up into three groups. Lenin’s
      Pravda has come out definitely against the Loan,
      expressing the point of view of the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov’s
      Yedinstvo strongly supports the Loan. Finally, the
      other organs of the socialist press Rabochaya Gazeta,
      Zemlya i Volya, and Volya Naroda have taken a
      “middle” stand, neither here nor there; they are not exactly for
      the Loan, nor are they exactly against it. This is the position
      also of the Soviet of Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies, which
      decided to support the Loan in principle, but is now having its
      doubts and is wavering. Dyen was right when it recently
      reproved this central and most powerful group, which includes
      the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, for its uncertain
      and ambiguous stand.


As if to confirm the justice of this reproof, the Soviet of
      Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies yesterday again returned to the
      once settled question of the Loan and had a discussion about
      it. N. S. Chkheidze announced that the government was expected
      shortly to issue a new statement exhaustively explaining its
      stand on issues of foreign and domestic policy. Until then,
      N. S. Chkheidze proposed that consideration of the question of
      supporting the Loan be postponed.

 

This attitude of the Lefts is puzzling, to say the least. After
      all, someone bas to run the government and carry out the reforms
      which suffering Russia has been craving for.


One of the two: either the present government enjoys the
      confidence of the Lefts, having so far done nothing to shirk the
      obligations it has assumed; or it does not enjoy such
      confidence. In the latter case, the Lefts, in withdrawing their
      support of the Provisional Government, must take upon themselves
      not only “control” over its activities, but the whole burden of
      government and responsibility before the people and history. If,
      however, they cannot blame the Provisional Government for
      anything that it has done up to now, then, naturally ,they have
      no right to wait for its future statements and should give it
      their full support. In any case, this equivocalness, this
      evasive reticence, these mental reservations on their part are
      quite intolerable. On the one hand, this does not in the least
      lighten the responsibility of the Provisional Government, which
      cannot even plead isolation against the verdict of history; on
      the other, this practically deprives the government of the
      support of the broad democratic masses and thus puts it in a
      difficult position.


Straightforwardness has always been a primary virtue of
      socialist trends. Socialist parties have always eschewed a
      policy of evasion, philistine spinelessness, and elastic
      opportunism. But now, in the question of the Loan, the central
      groups of Russian socialism have abandoned these traditional
      principles of theirs and taken to the path of
Octobrist[2]
      pussyfooting. Public opinion has a right to ask that they make
      their attitude on the question of the Loan perfectly clear, that
      they honestly and openly declare their participation or
      non-participation in it and thus fulfil their moral obligation
      to the Provisional Government, which means, either to give it
      the backing of the Left groups or to make known their
      disagreement with it.



The bank bosses are men of business. They take a sane view of
      politics: once you’ve promised to support the capitalist
      government (which is conducting an imperialist war), then come
      across with the Loan.


Correct! Having bound themselves hand and foot, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks have meekly
      surrendered to the capitalists. The government’s promise
      “shortly to issue a new statement exhaustively {!} explaining
      {it has been by now explained more than enough!} its stand on
      issues of foreign and domestic policy” is nothing but an empty
      phrase.


No “statements” in the form of declarations, assurances, or
      pronunciamentos will alter the fact of the matter. And the fact
      of the matter is that the capitalist government of Lvov, Guchkov,
      Milyukov
      and Co. represents the interests of capitalism, is bound up with
      those interests, and cannot

    

(even if it wanted to) break free
      from the imperialist, annexationist policies of conquest.


To gain the “backing” of the “Lefts” by means of empty
      non-committal phrases, that is, to use the authority of the
      Lefts to bolster up its imperialist policy without receding a
      step from it—this is what our imperialist government is
      trying to do, this is what, objectively, Chkheidze and his
      friends are helping it to do.


      “Octobrist pussyfooting”—what a winged little phrase!
      This is not only a practical, but also a correct evaluation of
      the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik political line by
      people who really know what it’s all about.

On April 14 our paper [Pravda]
      published a report from a correspondent in Kanavino,
      Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, to the effect that “a workers’
      militia paid for by the factory managements has been introduced
      at practically all the factories”.


Kanavino district, our correspondent reports, has sixteen
      factories and about thirty thousand workers, not counting
      railway employees. The organisation of a workers’ militia paid
      for by the capitalists therefore embraces a considerable number
      of the largest enterprises in the locality.


The organisation of a workers’ militia to be paid for by the
      capitalists is a measure of tremendous—it will be no
      exaggeration to say, gigantic and decisive—importance,
      both practically and in principle. The revolution cannot be made
      safe, its gains cannot be assured, its further development is
      impossible,until this measure has become general, until
      it is carried through all over the country.


The bourgeois and landowner republicans, who turned republican
      after they saw that it was impossible to rule the people
      otherwise, are trying to establish a republic that
      would be as monarchical as possible; something like that in
      France, which Shchedrin called a republic without
      republicans.[1]


At the present time, when the landowners and capitalists have
      come to realise the strength of the revolutionary masses, the
      most important thing for them is to safeguard the most
      essential institutions of the old regime, to safeguard the old
      instruments of oppression: the police, the bureaucracy, the
      standing army. They are trying to reduce the “civil militia” to
      an institution of the old type, i.e., to small detachments of
      armed men standing apart from the people

    

and as close as
      possible to the bourgeoisie and under the command of men from
      among the bourgeoisie.


The minimum programme of the Social-Democrats calls for the
      replacement of the standing army by a universal arming of the
      people. Most of the official Social-Democrats in Europe and most
      of our own Menshevik leaders, however, have “forgotten” or put
      aside the Party’s programme, substituting chauvinism
      (“defencism”) for internationalism, reformism
      for revolutionary
      tactics.


Yet now of all times, at the present revolutionary moment, it is
      most urgent and essential that there be a universal arming of
      the people. To assert that, while we have a revolutionary army,
      there is no need to arm the proletariat, or that there would
      “not be enough” arms to go round, is mere deception and
      trickery. The thing is to begin organising a universal militia
      straight away, so that everyone should learn the use of arms
      even if there is “not enough” to go round, for it is not at all
      necessary that the people have enough weapons to arm
      everybody. The people must learn, one and all, how to use arms,
      they must belong, one and all, to the militia which is to
      replace the police and the standing army.


The workers do not want an army standing apart from the people;
      what they want is that the workers and soldiers should
      merge into a single militia consisting of all the
      people.


Failing this, the apparatus of oppression will remain in force,
      ready today to serve Guchkov and his friends, the
      counter-revolutionary generals, and tomorrow Radko Dmitriev or
      some pretender to the throne and builder of a plebiscite
      monarchy.


The capitalists need a republic now, because they cannot
      “manage” the people otherwise. But what they need is a
      “parliamentary” republic, i.e., one where democracy would be
      limited to democratic elections, to the right of
      sending to parliament individuals who, as Marx aptly remarked,
      represent the people and oppress the
      people.[2]


The opportunists of contemporary Social-Democracy, who have
      substituted Scheidemann for Marx, have memorised the rule that
      parliamentarism “should be utilised” (which is absolutely
      correct), but have forgotten what Marx taught concerning
      proletarian democracy as distinguished from bourgeois
      parliamentarism.

 

The people need a republic in order to educate the masses in the
      methods of democracy. We need not only representation
      along democratic lines, but the building of the entire state
      administration from the bottom up by the masses themselves,
      their effective participation in all of life’s steps, their
      active role in the administration. Replacement  of the
      old organs of oppression, the police, the bureaucracy, the
      standing army, by a universal arming of the people, by a really
      universal militia, is the only way to guarantee the country a
      maximum of security against the restoration of the monarchy and
      to enable it to go forward firmly, systematically and
      resolutely towards socialism, not by “introducing” it from
      above, but by raising the vast mass of proletarians and
      semi-proletarians to the art of state administration, to the use
      of the whole state power.


Public service through a police standing above the people,
      through bureaucrats, who are the most faithful servants of the
      bourgeoisie, and through a standing army under the command of
      landowners and capitalists—that is the ideal of the
      bourgeois parliamentary republic, which is out to perpetuate the
      rule of Capital.


Public service through a really universal people’s militia,
      composed of men and women, a militia capable partly of replacing
      the bureaucrats—this, combined with the principle of
      elective office and displaceability of all public officers, with
      payment for their work according to proletarian, not
      “master-class”, bourgeois standards, is the ideal of the working
      class.


This ideal has not only become a part of our programme, it has
      not only won a place in the history of the labour movement in
      the West, namely, in the experience of the Paris
      Commune; it has not only been evaluated, stressed, explained
      and recommended by Marx, but it was actually put into practice
      by the Russian workers in the years 1905 and 1917.


The Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, in point of significance, in
      point of the type of government they create, are institutions of
      precisely that kind of democracy which does away with the old
      organs of oppression, and takes the road of a universal militia.


But how can the militia be made universal when the proletarians
      and semi-proletarians are herded in the factories,

    

crushed by
      unbearable labour for the landowners and the capitalists?


There is only one way: the workers’ militia must be paid for by
      the capitalists.


The capitalists must pay the workers for the hours and days
      which they give to public service.


This reliable method is being adopted by the working masses
      themselves. The example of the Nizhni-Novgorod workers should
      become a model for all Russia.


Comrade workers, make the peasants and the rest of the people
      see the need for a universal militia in place of the police and
      the old bureaucracy! Introduce such and only such a militia!
      Introduce it through the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, through
      the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, through the organs of local
      self-government that fall into the hands of the working
      class. Do not under any circumstances be content with a
      bourgeois militia. Draw the women into public service on an
      equal footing with the men. See to it that the capitalists pay
      the workers for days devoted to public service in the militia!


Learn the methods of democracy by actual practice, right now, on
      your own, from the bottom up—rouse the masses to effective,
      immediate, universal participation in government—this and
      this alone will assure the full triumph of the revolution and
      its unswerving, purposeful and systematic advance.

We have been informed that the Executive Committee of the Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies has just received a Note
      which our Provisional
      Government forwarded to all its representatives abroad.
    

This Note, apparently, is that very “statement” which N. S.
      Chkheidze had expected to be issued within three days and
      which was to contain definite pronouncements against
      annexations.
    

But what do we find?
    

The Note contains a forthright declaration by the Provisional
      Government to the effect that Russia will fight to the end, that
      Russia remains true to her obligations to the Allies.
    

This Note has had the effect of a bombshell.
    

Among the majority
      of the Executive Committee, Chkheidze, Tsereteli,
      and others, there is complete bewilderment. The bankruptcy of
      the entire policy of “agreements” is obvious—and it has
      come much sooner than we expected.
    

Talk in the Contact Commission will not end the imperialist war.

The Provisional Government’s Note has fully demonstrated the
      correctness of the position which our Party adopted in the
      resolution of the Petrograd City Conference, namely,
    

      (1) that the Provisional Governmentis an out-and-out imperialist
      government bound hand and foot by Anglo-French and Russian
      capital;
    

      (2) that all the promises it has made or may make (as to
      “ascertaining the will of the people for peace”, etc.) are
      nothing but deceit;
    

      (3) that the Provisional Government, irrespective of its
      composition,cannot renounce annexations, because in
      this war, and especially at this moment, the capitalist
      class is tied by banking capital;
    

      (4) that the policy of the petty bourgeoisie pursued by the
      Narodniks, Mensheviks and most of the leaders of the present
      Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, a policy of encouraging false
      hopes as to the possibility of “improving” the capitalists
      (i.e., the Provisional Government) by “corrective measures”,
      has once again been exposed by this Note.


In view of this, the Central Committee finds:


      1) that any change in the composition of the present government
         (the resignation of Milyukov, the recall of Kerensky, etc.)
         would only be imitating the worst methods of bourgeois
         parliamentary republicanism, which substitutes for
         the struggle of classes the rivalry of cliques and the
         reshuffling of individuals;

 

      2) that the only means of salvation for the mass of the
         petty-bourgeois population, which vacillates between the
         capitalists and the working class, is to unreservedly join
         the revolutionary proletariat, which is the only class
         capable of really breaking the fetters of finance capital and
         the policy of annexation. Only by taking—with the
         support of the majority of the people—the whole power
         of state into its own hands, will the revolutionary
         proletariat, together with the revolutionary soldiers,
         create, in the shape of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
         Deputies, a government which will be trusted by the workers
         of all countries and which will alone be capable of quickly
         putting an end to the war by means of a truly democratic
         peace.

Brothers, soldiers!


We are all worn out by this
      frightful
war, which has cost millions of lives, crippled millions of
      people and caused untold misery, ruin, and starvation.


And more and more people are beginning to ask themselves:
      What started this war, what is it being waged for?


Every day it is becoming clearer to us, the workers and
      peasants, who bear the brunt of the war, that it was started and
      is being waged by the capitalists of all countries for the sake
      of the capitalists’ interests, for the sake of world supremacy,
      for the sake of markets for the manufacturers, factory owners
      and bankers, for the sake of plundering the weak
      nationalities. They are carving up colonies and seizing
      territories in the Balkans and in Turkey—and for this the
      European peoples must be ruined, for this we must die, for this
      we must witness the ruin, starvation and death of our
      families.


The capitalist class in all countries is deriving colossal,
      staggering, scandalously high profits from contracts and war
      supplies, from concessions in annexed countries, and from the
      rising price of goods. The capitalist class has imposed
      contribution on all the nations for decades ahead in the shape
      of high interest on the billions lent in war loans. And we, the
      workers and peasants, must die, suffer ruin, and starve, must
      patiently bear all this and strengthen our oppressors, the
      capitalists, by having the workers of the different countries
      exterminate each other and feel hatred for each other.

 

Are we going to continue submissively to bear our yoke, to put
      up with the war between the capitalist classes?Are we going to
      let this war drag on by taking the side of our own national
      governments, our own national bourgeoisies, our own national
      capitalists, and thereby destroying the international unity of
      the workers of all countries, of the whole world?


No, brother soldiers, it is time we opened our eyes, it is time
      we took our fate into our own hands. In all countries popular
      wrath against the capitalist class, which has drawn the people
      into the war, is growing, spreading, and gaining strength. Not
      only in Germany, but even in Britain, which before the war had
      the reputation of being one of the freest countries, hundreds
      and hundreds of true friends and representatives of the working
      class are languishing in prison for having spoken the honest
      truth against the war and against the capitalists. The [February] revolution in Russia is only the
      first step of the first revolution; it should be followed and
      will be followed by others.


The new government in Russia—which has overthrown Nicholas
      II, who was as bad a crowned brigand as Wilhelm II—is a
      government of the capitalists. It is waging just as predatory
      and imperialist a war as the capitalists of Germany, Britain,
      and other countries. It has endorsed the predatory secret
      treaties concluded by Nicholas II with the capitalists of
      Britain, France, and other countries; it is not publishing these
      treaties for the world to know, just as the German Government is
      not publishing its secret and equally predatory treaties with
      Austria, Bulgaria, and so on.


On April 20 the Russian Provisional
      Government published a Note re-endorsing the old predatory
      treaties concluded by the tsar and declaring its readiness to
      fight the war to a victorious finish, thereby arousing the
      indignation even of those who have hitherto trusted and
      supported it.


But, in addition to the capitalist government, the Russian
      revolution has given rise to spontaneous revolutionary
      organisations representing the vast majority of the workers and
      peasants, namely, the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
      in Petrograd and in the majority of Russia’s cities. Most of the
      soldiers and some of the workers in Russia—like very many
      workers and soldiers in Germany—still

    

preserve an
      unreasoning trust in the government of the capitalists and in
      their empty and lying talk of a peace without annexations, a war
      of defence, and so on.
    

But, unlike the capitalists, the workers and poor peasants have
      no interest in annexations or in protecting the profits of the
      capitalists. And, therefore, every day, every step taken by the
      capitalist government, both in Russia and in Germany, will
      expose the deceit of the capitalists, will expose the fact that
      as long as capitalist rule lasts there can be no really
      democratic, non-coercive peace based on a real renunciation of
      all annexations, i.e., on the liberation of all colonies without
      exception, of all oppressed, forcibly annexed or underprivileged
      nationalities without exception, and the war will in all
      likelihood become still more acute and protracted.


Only if state power in both the, at present, hostile
      countries, for example, in both Russia and Germany, passes
      wholly and exclusively into the hands of the revolutionary
      Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which are really
      capable of rending the whole mesh of capitalist relations and
      interests, will the workers of both the belligerent countries
      acquire confidence in each other and be able to put a speedy
      end to the war on the basis of a really democratic peace that
      will really liberate all the nations and nationalitiea
      of the world.
    

Brothers, soldiers!


Let us do everything we can to hasten this, to achieve this
      aim. Let us not fear sacrifices—any sacrifice for the
      workers’ revolution will be less painful than the sacrifices of
      war. Every victorious step of the revolution will save hundreds
      of thousands and millions of people from death, ruin, and
      starvation.


Peace to the hovels, war on the palaces! Peace to the workers of
      all countries! Long live the fraternal unity of the revolutionary
      workers of all countries! Long live socialism!

The cards are on the table. We have every reason to be grateful
      to Guchkov
      and Mllyukov
      for their Note, printed today in all the newspapers.
    

The majority of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the Narodniks, Mensheviks, all
      those who until now have appealed for confidence in the
      Provisional Government, have received fitting punishment. They
      hoped, expected, and believed that the Provisional Government,
      under the beneficent influence of “contact”
      with Chkheidze, Skobelev, and Steklov, would for ever repudiate
      annexations. Things have turned out somewhat differently....
    

In its Note of April 18, the Provisional
      Government speaks of “the desire of the whole nation [!] to
      fight the world war out to a decisive victory”.


      “Needless to say,” the Note adds, “the Provisional Government
      ... will fully stand by its obligations towards our Allies.”


Short and clear. War to a decisive victory. The alliance with
      the British and French bankers is sacred....


Who concluded this alliance with “our” Allies, i.e.,
      with the British and French multimillionaires? The tsar,
      Rasputin, the tsar’s gang, of course. But to Milyukov and
      Co. this treaty is sacred.
    

Why?


Some say: because Milyukov Is insincere, he is a crafty person
      and so on.
    

But that is not the point. The point is that Guchkov, Milyukov,
      Tereshchenko, and Konovalov are spokesmen of the
      capitalists. And the seizure of foreign lands is
      necessary

    

to the capitalists. They will receive new markets, new
      places to export capital to, new opportunities to arrange
      profitable jobs for tens of thousands of their sons, etc. The
      point is that at the present moment the interests of
      the Russian capitalists are identical with those of the British
      and French capitalists. That, and that alone, is the reason why
      the tsar’s treaties with the British and French capitalists are
      precious to the Provisional Government of the Russian
      capitalists.


The new Note of the Provisional Government will pour oil on the
      flames. It can only arouse a bellicose spirit in Germany. It
      will help Wilhelm the Brigand to go on deceiving “his own”
      workers and soldiers and drag them into a war “to a finish”.


The new Note of the Provisional Government puts the issue
      squarely: what next?


From the very first moment of our revolution, the British and
      French capitalists have been assuring us that the Russian
      revolution was made solely and exclusively in order to fight the
      war out “to a finish”. The capitalists want to plunder Turkey,
      Persia, and China. If this should entail the slaughter of
      another ten million or so Russian muzhiks—what of it?
      What we need is a “decisive victory”.... And now the Provisional
      Government, with utter frankness, has adopted the same
      course.


      “Fight—because we want to plunder.”


      “Die in your tens of thousands every day—because ‘we’ have
      not yet fought it out and have not yet got our share of the
      spoils!”


No class-conscious worker, no class-conscious soldier will
      support the policy of “confidence” in the Provisional Government
      any longer. The policy of confidence is bankrupt.


Our Social-Democratic City Conference stated in its resolution that
      the correctness
      of our view would be corroborated now every
day.[1]

But
      not even we had expected events to move so fast.


The present Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies is faced
      with the alternative: either to swallow the pill offered

    

by
      Guchkov and Milyukov, which would mean renouncing an independent
      political role once and for all, for tomorrow Milyukov would put
      his “feet on the table” and reduce the soviet to a mere cipher;
      or to reject Milyukov’s Note, which would mean breaking with the
      old policy of confidence and adopting the course proposed by
      Pravda.


Naturally, a middle-of-the-road course might be found. But would
      it be for long?


Workers and soldiers, you must now loudly declare that there
      must be only one power in the country—the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, The Provisional Government, the
      government of a handful of capitalists, must make way for these
      Soviets.

Mr. Plekhanov gives an excellent illustration of this. In his
      First of May letter to the Association of Socialist Students
      published in today’s Rech, Dyelo Naroda, and
      Yedinstvo, he writes:



      “It {the International Socialist Congress of 1889} understood
      that the social, or more exactly—the socialist, revolution
      presupposes prolonged educational and organisational work within
      the working class. This has now been forgotten here by people
      who call on the Russian working masses to seize political power,
      an act which would make sense only if the objective conditions
      necessary for a social revolution prevailed. These conditions do
      not exist yet....



And so on in the same strain, ending with an appeal for
      “whole-hearted support” of the Provisional
      Government.


This argument of Mr. Plekhanov is the typical argument of a
      small group of “have-beens”, who call themselves
      Social-Democrats. And because it is typical it is worth dealing
      with at length.


First of all, is it reasonable and honest to quote the First
      Congress of the Second International, and not the last one?


The First Congress of the Second International (1889–1914) took
      place in 1889, the last, in Basle, in 1912. The Basle Manifesto,
      which was adopted unanimously,  speaks precisely,
      definitely, directly, and clearly (so that not even the
      Plekhanovs can twist the sense of It) of a proletarian
      revolution,  and one, moreover, which is considered in
      connection with the very war which subsequently broke
      out (in1914).

 

It is not difficult to understand why those socialists who have
      gone over to the bourgeoisie are prone to “forget” the Basle
      Manifesto as a whole, or this most important part of it.


Secondly, the seizure of political power by “the Russian working
      masses”, writes our author, “would make sense only if the
      objective conditions necessary for a social revolution
      prevailed”.


This is a muddle, not a thought.


Assuming even that the word “social” here is a misprint
      for “socialist”, this is not the only muddle. ’What classes do
      the Russian working masses consist of? Everybody knows that they
      consist of workers and peasants. Which of these classes is in
      the majority? The peasants. Who are these peasants as far as
      their class position is concerned? Petty proprietors. The
      question arises: if the petty proprietors constitute the
      majority of the population and if the objective conditions for
      socialism are lacking, then how can the majority of the
      population declare in favour of socialism? Who can say
      anything or who says anything about establishing socialism
      against the will of the majority?


Mr. Plekhanov has got mixed up in the most ludicrous fashion at
      the very outset.


To find himself in a ridiculous position is not the worst
      punishment a man can suffer, who, following the example of the
      capitalist press, creates an “enemy” of his own imagination
      instead of quoting the exact words of this or that political
      opponent.


Further. In whose hands should “political power” be,
      even from the point of view of a vulgar bourgeois
      democrat from Rech? In the hands of the majority of the
      population. Do the “Russian working masses” [i.e. the proletariat and peasantry], so
      inaptly referred to by the muddled social-chauvinist, constitute
      the majority of the population in Russia? Undoubtedly they
      do—the overwhelming majority!


How then, without betraying democracy—even democracy as
      understood by Milyukov—can one be opposed to the “seizure
      of political power” by the “Russian working masses”?


The deeper you go into the wood, the thicker the trees. Each
      step in our analysis opens up new abysses of confusion in
      Mr. Plekhanov’s ideas.

 

The social-chauvinist is against political power passing to the
      majority of the population in Russia!


Mr. Plekhanov doesn’t know what he is talking about. He has also
      confused—though Marx as far back as 1875 made a point of
      warning against such confusion—the “working masses” with
      the mass of proletarians and
semi-proletarians.[1]
We shall explain the difference to the ex-Marxist, Mr. Plekhanov.


Can the majority of the peasants in Russia demand and carry out
      the nationalisation of the land? Certainly it can. Would this be
      a socialist revolution? It would not. It would still be
      a bourgeois revolution, for the nationalisation of the land is a
      measure that is not incompatible with the existence of
      capitalism. It is, however, a blow to private ownership
      of the most important means of production. Such a blow would
      strengthen the proletarians and semi-proletarians far
      more than was the case during the revolutions of the
      seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.


Further. Can the majority of the peasants in Russia declare for
      the merging of all the banks into one, for having a branch of a
      single nation-wide state bank in each village?


It can, because the convenience and advantage for the people of
      such a measure are unquestionable. Even the
      “defencists” could be for such a measure, as it would heighten
      Russia’s capacity for “defence” enormously.


Is it economically possible to immediately effect such a merger
      of all the banks? Without a doubt, it is quite possible.


Would this be a socialist measure? No, this would not
      yet be socialism.


Further. Can the majority of the peasants in Russia declare in
      favour of the Sugar Manufacturers’ Syndicate passing into the
      hands of the government, to be controlled by the workers and
      peasants, and the price of sugar being lowered?


It certainly can, for that would benefit the majority of the
      people.


Is that possible economically? It is quite possible, since the
      Sugar Syndicate has not only developed economically into a
      single industrial organism on a national scale, but had
      already been subject to “state” control under Tsarism

    

      (i.e., control by government officials serving the capitalists).


Would the taking over of the syndicate by the
      democratic-bourgeois, peasant, state be a socialist measure?


No, that would not yet be socialism. Mr. Plekhanov could have
      easily convinced himself of that if he had recalled the commonly
      known axioms of Marxism.


The question is: Would such measures as the merging of the banks
      and turning over the Sugar Manufacturers’ Syndicate to a
      democratic peasant government enhance or diminish the
      role, importance, and influence of the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians among the general mass of the population?


They would undoubtedly enhance them, for those measures do
      not grow out of a system of petty production; they were
      made possible by those “objective conditions” which were
      still  lacking in 1889, but which already
      exist now.


Such measures would inevitably enhance the role, importance, and
      influence upon the population of the workers, especially the
      city workers, who are the vanguard of the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians of town and country.


After these measures will have been put into effect,
      further progress towards socialism in Russia would
      become fully possible, and given the aid of the more advanced
      and experienced workers of Western Europe, who have broken with
      their West-European Plekhanovs, Russia’s real
      transition to socialism would be inevitable,  and the
      success of such a transition would be assured. 


This is the line of argument which every Marxist and socialist
      who has not gone over to the side of “his own” national
      bourgeoisie should use.

The Note of the Provisional Government on



war to a victorious finish
      has aroused indignation even among those who nourished illusory
      hopes for a possible renunciation of annexations on the part of
      the government of capitalists. The newspapers that have been
      acting as mouthpieces of this petty-bourgeois policy of illusory
      hopes are today either mumbling in dismay, like Rabochaya
      Gazeta, or are trying to turn this indignation against
      individuals.


Novaya
      Zhizn[1] writes: “There is no place in the government of
      democratic Russia for a champion of the interests of
      international capital! We are sure the Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies will act promptly in taking the most
      energetic measures towards rendering Mr. Milyukov harmless.” And
      Dyelo
      Naroda expresses the same piece of philistine wisdom in the
      following words. Milyukov’s Note, it says, “tries to reduce to
      nought a statement of the greatest international importance
      approved by the entire cabinet’.


Icons versus cannons. Phrases versus capital. The government’s
      statement renouncing annexations was a piece of utterly
      worthless diplomatic verbiage, which might deceive an ignorant
      muzhik,
      but could not “confuse” the leaders of the petty-bourgeois
      Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary parties, the
      writers of Novaya Zhizn and Dyelo Naroda,
      unless they were willing to be deceived. What empty phrases are
      these about there being “no place in the government of
      democratic Russia for a champion of the interests of
      international capital!” Educated people ought to be ashamed of
      themselves, writing such



nonsense.


 

The whole Provisional Government is a government of the
      capitalist class. It is a matter of class, not of persons. To
      attack Milyukov
      personally, to demand, directly or indirectly, his dismissal, is
      a silly comedy, for no change of personalities can
      change anything so long as the classes in power are
      unchanged.


To draw a line between the “democracy” of Russia,
      Britain, France, etc., and the championing of capital is to sink
      to the level, of the economic and political wisdom of a
Gapon.[2]


It is pardonable for ignorant muzhiks to demand of the
      capitalist a “promise” that he “live righteously” and not
      capitalistically, that he should not “champion the
      interests of capital”. But for the leaders of the Petrograd
      Soviet, for the writers of Novaya Zhizn and
      Dyelo Naroda to adopt such methods means to nourish the
      illusory hopes which the people place in the capitalists, hopes
      that are most harmful and ruinous to the cause of freedom, to
      the cause of the revolution.

Citizen V.
    Chernov writes in Dyelo Naroda of April 16:



      “He {Lenin} did not even think that, even from his own point of
      view, Britain’s consent to his journey would have been better in
      that it would have been due to the pressure of the Russian
      revolution, whereas Germany’s consent may appear more suspicious
      as to its motives.”



Conclusion: Lenin is something of a maniac.


Very well. But what about the thirty arrivals who belong to
      different parties, including the Bund?
      Are they all maniacs? Did none of them “even think”?


Further. How about the telegram from Martov, Natanson
      (the leader of the S. R. Party, mark you), Axelrod, and others,
      saying: “We find it absolutely impossible to return to
      Russia via England”? (See Rabochaya Gazeta for April 15.)


Does this mean that both Martov and Natanson are maniacs, that
      they too “did not even think”?


But these witnesses, who do not belong to our
      Party—Natanson is a witness belonging to V. Chernov’s
      party—confirm the fact that it was
      absolutely impossible to make the journey any other
      way!


What is the conclusion? It is this—either V. Chernov is a
      queer fellow who uses phrases to avoid the facts, or he
      has allowed himself to be so frightened by philistine-chauvinist
      gossip and slander that he has lost his head.

In No. 15 of Yedinstvo,
      Mr. Plekhanov, with an abundance of abuse unusual even for that
      abusive publication, attacks Pravda in an attempt to
      suppress two incontestably established facts.


You won’t succeed in hushing them up, gentlemen!


Fact number one. Mr. Plekhanov did not reprint our report, published in Izvestia of
      the Petrograd Soviet No. 32, for April 5, 1917, or the
      resolution of the Executive Committee.


This is not only an expression of anarchist disrespect for the
      elected representatives of the majority of the
      soldiers, but the dishonest method of a riot-monger.


Fact number two. Mr. Plekhanov’s hounding tactics has called
      forth a protest not from us, but from Dyelo
      Naroda, to which even such a colleague of Guchkov and
      Milyukov as Kerensky contributes. Dyelo Naroda for
      April 13, 1917, wrote of Mr. Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo in
      black and white:



      “We are accustomed to see such words and such a method of
      struggle in the columns of Russkaya
      Volya. But to see them employed in articles written by
      socialists is, frankly speaking, painful and depressing.”



This is the testimony of defencist witnesses, who politically
      are a thousand times closer to Mr. Plekhanov than to us.


What sort of readers does Mr. Plekhanov count on when he
      dismisses the testimony of a witness by saying
      that Dyelo Naroda has made an “inept remark”?


The witness has exposed Mr. Plekhanov’s riot-mongering
      methods.

 

There was a time when Mr. Plekhanov was a socialist. Now he has
      sunk to the level of Russkaya Volya.


No amount of abuse can do away with the fact that even Dyelo
      Naroda has exposed Mr. Plekhanov.


In an editorial reprinted in our issue for April 18
      Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet (No. 43, April 17)
      called this hounding campaign “dishonest and disgusting”.


This witness states bluntly that this dishonest and disgusting
      hounding campaign on the part of the dark forces and their
      newspapers was and is a fact. Mr. °Plekhanov, fallen to
      the Level of Russkaya Volya, stands hopelessly
      condemned.

Having considered the situation which has arisen in Petrograd
      after the imperialist, annexationist, and predatory Note of the
      Provisional Government of April 18, 1917, and after a
      number of meetings and demonstrations of the people held in the
      streets of Petrograd on April 20, the Central Committee of the
      R.S.D.L.P. resolves:


      1. Party propagandists and speakers must refute the despicable
        lies of the capitalist papers and of the papers supporting the
        capitalists to the effect that we are holding out the threat
        of civil war. This is a despicable lie, for only at
        the present moment, as long as the capitalists and their
        government cannot and dare not use force against the masses,
        as long as the mass of soldiers and workers are freely
        expressing their will and freely electing and displacing
        all authorities—at such a moment any
        thought of civil war would be naïve, senseless,
        preposterous; at such a moment there must be compliance
        with the will of the majority of the population and free
        criticism of this will by the discontented minority; should
        violence be resorted to, the responsibility will fall on the
        Provisional Government and its supporters.


      2. By their outcries against civil war the government of the
         capitalists and its newspapers are only trying to conceal the
         reluctance of the capitalists, who admittedly constitute an
         insignificant minority of the people, to submit to the will
         of the majority.


     3. In order to learn the will of the majority of the population
         in Petrograd, where there is now an unusually large number of
         soldiers who are familiar with the sentiment of

    

the peasants
         and correctly express it, a popular vote must at once be
         arranged in all the districts of Petrograd and its suburbs to
         ascertain what the attitude is towards the government’s Note,
         what support the various parties enjoy, and what kind of
         Provisional Government is desired.


      4. All Party propagandists must advocate these views and this
         proposal at factories, in regiments, in the streets, etc., by
         means of peaceful discussion and peaceful
         demonstrations, as well as meetings everywhere; we must
         endeavour to organise regular voting in factories and
         regiments, taking care that order and comradely discipline
         are strictly observed.


      5. Party propagandists must again and again protest against the
         despicable slander spread by the capitalists alleging that
         our Party stands for a separate peace with Germany. We
         consider Wilhelm II as bad a crowned brigand meriting
         execution as Nicholas II, and the German Guchkovs, i.e., the
         German capitalists, just as much annexationists, robbers, and
         imperialists as the Russian, British, and all other
         capitalists. We are against negotiating with the
         capitalists, we are for negotiating and fraternising with
         the revolutionary workers and soldiers of all countries.
         We are convinced that the reason why the Guchkov-Milyukov
         government is trying to aggravate the situation is because it
         knows that the workers’ revolution in Germany is beginning,
         and that this revolution will be a blow to the capitalists of
         all countries.


      6. When the Provisional Government spreads rumours about utter
         and unavoidable economic chaos, it is not only trying to
         frighten the people into leaving the power in the hands of
         this Provisional Government, but is also vaguely, fumblingly
         expressing the profound and indubitable truth that
         all the nations of the world have been led into a
         blind alley, that the war waged in the interests of the
         capitalists has driven them to the brink of an abyss, and
         that there is really no way out except through the transfer
         of power to the revolutionary class, i.e., to the
         revolutionary proletariat, which is capable of adopting
         revolutionary measures.


If there are any stocks of grain, etc., in the country, the new
      government of the workers and soldiers will know how to dispose
      of them too. But if the capitalist war has brought

    

economic ruin
      to a stage where there is no bread at all, the capitalist
      government will only aggravate the condition of the people
      instead of improving it.


      7. We consider the policy of the present majority of leaders of
         the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, of the
         Narodnik and Menshevik parties, to be profoundly erroneous,
         since confidence in the Provisional Government, attempts to
         compromise with it, dickering over amendments, etc., would in
         fact mean only so many more useless scraps of paper and
         useless delays; and besides, this policy threatens to create
         a divergence between the will of the Soviet on the one hand,
         and that of the majority of revolutionary soldiers at the
         front and in Petrograd and of the majority of workers, on the
         other.


      8. We call upon those workers and soldiers who believe that the
         Soviet must change its policy and renounce the policy of
         confidence in and compromise with the capitalist government,
         to hold new elections of delegates to the Soviet of Workers’
         and Soldiers’ Deputies and to send to that body only people
         who would steadfastly hold to a quite definite opinion
         consonant with the actual will of the majority.

Events in Petrograd during the last few days, especially
      yesterday, illustrate how right we were in speaking of the
      “honest” defencism of the mass as distinguished from
      the defencism of the leaders and parties.


The mass of the population is made up of proletarians,
      semi-proletarians, and poor peasants. They are the vast majority
      of the nation. These classes are not at all interested
      in annexations. Imperialist policies, the profits of banking
      capital, incomes from railways in Persia, lucrative jobs in Galicia
      and Armenia, putting restraints on the freedom of
      Finland—all these are things in which these classes are
      not interested.


But all, these things taken together just go to make up what is
      known in science and the press as imperialist, annexationist,
      predatory policy.


The crux of the matter is that the Guchkovs,
      Milyukovs,
      and Lvovs—be
      they even all paragons of virtue, disinterestedness,
      and love of their fellow-man—are the spokesmen, leaders,
      and chosen representatives of the capitalist class, a
      class which has a vested interest in a predatory, annexationist
      policy. This class invested billions “in the war”, and is making
      hundreds of millions “out of the war” and annexations (i.e., out
      of the subjugation or forced incorporation of alien
      nationalities).


To believe that the capitalist class will “mend its
      ways”, will cease to be a capitalist class, will give up its
      profits, is a fatuous hope, an idle dream, and in effect a
      deception of the people. Only petty-bourgeois politicians,
      fluctuating between capitalist and proletarian policies, can
      entertain or encourage such fatuous hopes. Herein lies the
      mistake of

    

the present leaders of the Narodnik
      parties and the Mensheviks, Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Chernov, and
      the others.


The mass representatives of defencism are not at all versed in
      politics. They have not been able to learn politics from books,
      from participation in the Duma, or from close observation of
      people engaged in politics.


The mass representatives of defencism still do not know that
      wars are waged by governments, that governments
      represent the interests of certain classes, that the present
      war, on the part of both belligerent groups, is waged by the
      capitalists in the predatory interests of and for the predatory
      aims of the capitalists.


Unaware as they are of this, the mass representatives of
      defencism argue quite simply: we do not want annexations, we
      demand a democratic peace, we do not want to fight for
      Constantinople, for putting down Persia, for plundering Turkey,
      and so on; we “demand” that the Provisional Government give up
      its policy of annexations.


The mass representatives of defencism are sincere in
      wishing this, not in a personal but in a class sense, because
      they speak for classes that are not interested in
      annexations. But what these representatives of the masses do not
      know is that the capitalists and their government may throw over
      the policy of annexations in words, may dangle promises and
      mouth fine phrases, but cannot really abandon the idea
      of annexations.


That is why tile mass representatives of defencism were so
      strongly and legitimately shocked by the Provisional
      Government’s Note of April 18.


People familiar with politics could not have been surprised by
      this Note, for they knew only too well that when the capitalists
      “renounce annexations” they do not really mean it. It is just
      the usual trick and phrase-mongering of diplomats.


But the “honest” mass representatives of defencism were
      surprised, shocked, indignant. They felt—they did
      not understand it quite clearly, but they felt that they had
      been tricked.


This is the essence of the crisis and it should be
      clearly distinguished from the opinions, expectations, and
      suppositions of single individuals and parties.

 

To patch up this crisis for a while with a new declaration, with
      a new Note (that is what Mr. Plekhanov’s advice in
      Yedinstvo and the aspirations of Milyukov and Co., on
      the one hand, and those of Chkheidze and Tsereteli, on the
      other, amount to)—to paper over the cracks with a new
      promise is of course possible, but this can do nothing but
      harm. A new promise would inevitably mean a new deception of the
      masses’ therefore a new outburst of indignation, and such an
      outburst, if lacking intelligent orientation, might easily
      become very harmful.


The masses should be told the whole truth. The government of the
      capitalists cannot abandon annexations; it is caught in
      its own meshes, and there is no escape. It feels, it realises,
      it sees that without revolutionary measures (of which only a
      revolutionary class is capable) there is no way out,
      and it is becoming panicky, losing its head; it promises one
      thing, but does another; at one minute it threatens the masses
      with violence (Guchkov and Shingaryov), at the next it proposes
      that the power be taken out of its hands.


Economic ruin, crisis, the horrors of war, an impasse from which
      there is no way out—this is what the capitalists have
      brought all the nations to.


Indeed there is no way out—except through the
      transfer of power to the revolutionary class, to the
      revolutionary proletariat, which alone, supported by the
      majority of the population, is capable of aiding the revolution
      to victory in all the belligerent countries and leading
      humanity to lasting peace and liberation from the yoke of
      capitalism.

Rabochaya
      Gazeta writes today:



      “We have been strongly opposed to the civil warmongering by
      Lenin’s followers. But now the signal for civil war no longer
      comes from Lenin’s followers but from the Provisional
      Government, which has published a statement that makes a mockery
      of democratic aspirations. This is truly a mad step, and
      immediate determined action by the Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies is needed if we are to avert the dire
      consequences of this madness.”



What can be more absurd and ridiculous than this fairy-tale
      about “civil warmongering” on our part, when we have declared in
      the clearest, most formal and unequivocal manner that all our
      work should be focused on patiently explaining the
      proletarian policy as opposed to the petty-bourgeois defencist
      craze with its faith in the capitalists?


Does Rabochaya Gazeta really fail to understand that
      these outcries about civil war are now raised by the capitalists
      in order to break the will of the majority of the people?


Is there a grain of Marxism in proclaiming the conduct of the
      capitalists “madness”, when, caught in the vise of Russian and
      Anglo-French imperialist capital, they cannot act otherwise?


Mr. Plekhanov, in today’s Yedinstvo, is more forthright
      in expressing the policy of the entire petty-bourgeois-defencist
      bloc when he calls upon the Soviet to come “to an
      agreement” with the Provisional Government. An amusing
      appeal, this. It is like serving mustard after dinner.


Don’t we all know that an agreement was concluded long ago? That
      it has been in existence since the beginning of the revolution?
      The whole thing is that the present crisis

    

is due to the fact
      that the agreement has proved to be a scrap of paper, an empty
      promise! To answer the “accursed questions” with which the
      failure of the existing agreement has now squarely
      confronted the people by calling for an “agreement” in general,
      without saying a word about its terms or about real
      guarantees for it, to answer by sighing and crying “0 ye
      Madmen!”—is this not a tragicomedy of the petty-bourgeois
      Louis Hianes? (Louis Blanc was a labour leader only in words, in
      reality he was the tail of the bourgeoisie.)


      “Immediate determined action is needed,” Rabochaya
      Gazeta importantly declares. ’What kind of “action”, my
      dear fellow-citizens? You cannot say what, you do not know what
      yourselves. All you do know is to declaim, because,
      like

Louis Blanc[See also: Blancism], you have forgotten about the
      class struggle, you have side-tracked the class struggle under
      cover of petty-bourgeois phraseology and declamation.

The Petrograd
Gazeta-Kopeika[1]
    in its issue of April 14 published the following report:

PRIVATELY-OWNED LANDS TO BE REQUISITIONED


Kishlnev, April 13. In view of the fact that there are
      great tracts of uncultivated land in the uyezd that are not
      leased on account of the high rent, the Akkerman Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies has recommended all village
      and volost committees to requisition all unused privately owned
      lands for crop cultivation through the Commissar in cases where
      voluntary agreements are impossible.



If this report is true, it is extremely important. Obviously,
      the Akkerman Soviet is guided by practical considerations, and
      is no doubt closely and intimately acquainted with local
      conditions. It considers correctly that the crops must be
      increased at all costs to the fullest possible extent. But how
      can this be done when the landowners have raised the rents
      scandalously?


By voluntary agreements with the landowners?


This is what Minister Shingaryov emphatically advises from
      Petrograd; he threatens the peasants, and protests vehemently
      against arbitrary action. It is all very well for Shingaryov to
      argue from Petrograd. It is all very well for him to defend the
      landowners in the name of the government of the capitalists.


But how about the situation of the peasants locally? Does not
      the Akkerman Soviet appraise the situation more correctly when
      it speaks of “voluntary agreements” being “impossible”?

The political crisis that developed between April 19 and 21 must
      be regarded, at least in its initial stage, as having
      passed.


The petty-bourgeois mass, angered by the capitalists, first
      swung away from them towards the workers; but
      two days later they again followed the Menshevik
      and Narodnik
      leaders, who stand for “confidence” in and “compromise” with the
      capitalists.


These leaders have compromised, completely surrendered all their
      positions, contenting themselves with the empty and purely
      verbal reservations of the capitalists.


The causes of the crisis have not been removed, and the
      recurrence of such crises is unavoidable.


The nature of the crisis is that the petty-bourgeois mass is
      vacillating between its age-old faith in the capitalists and its
      resentment against them, a tendency to place its faith in the
      revolutionary proletariat.


The capitalists are dragging out the war and covering up the
      fact by phrase-mongering. Only the revolutionary proletariat can
      put an end to, and is working towards putting an end to the war
      by means of a world revolution of the workers, a revolution
      which is obviously mounting in our country, ripening in Germany,
      and drawing closer in a number of other countries.


The slogan “Down with the Provisional Government!” is an
      incorrect one at the present moment because, in the

    

absence of a
      solid (i.e., a class-conscious and organised) majority of the
      people on the side of the revolutionary proletariat, such a
      slogan is either an empty phrase, or, objectively, amounts to
      attempts of an adventurist
character.[2]


We shall favour the transfer of power to the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians only when the Soviets of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies adopt our policy and are willing to take the
      power into their own hands.


The organisation of our Party, the consolidation of the
      proletarian forces, clearly proved inadequate at the time of
      tile crisis.


The slogans of the moment are:
    

      (1) To explain the proletarian line and the proletarian
          way of ending the war;
    

      (2) To criticise the petty-bourgeois policy of placing
          trust in the government of the capitalists and compromising
          with it;
    

      (3) To carry on propaganda and agitation from group to group
          in every regiment, in every factory, and,
          particularly, among the most backward masses, such as
          domestic servants, unskilled labourers, etc., since it was
          their backing in the first place that the bourgeoisie tried
          to gain during the crisis;
    

      (4) To organise, organise and once more
          organise the proletariat, in every factory, in
          every district and in every city quarter.
    

The resolution of the Petrograd Soviet of April 21 banning all
      street meetings and demonstrations for two days must be
      unconditionally obeyed by every member of our Party. The Central
      Committee already distributed yesterday morning, and is today
      publishing in Pravda, a resolution which states that
      “at such a moment any thought of civil war would be senseless
      and preposterous”, that all demonstrations must be peaceful
      ones, and that the responsibility for violence will fall on the
      Provisional Government and its
supporters.[1]

Our Party therefore
      considers that the above mentioned resolution of the Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies as a whole (and especially the
      part banning armed demonstrations and shooting In the air) is
      entirely correct and must be unconditionally obeyed.


We call upon all the workers and soldiers to consider carefully
      the results of the crisis of the last two days and

    

to send as
      delegates to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and
      to the Executive Committee only such comrades as express the
      will of the majority, in all cases where a delegate does not
      express the opinion of the majority, new elections should be
      held in the factories and barracks.

Petrograd and the whole of Russia have passed through a serious
      political crisis, the first political crisis since the
      revolution.


On April 18 the Provisional Government issued its unhappily
      notorious Note, which confirmed the predatory aims of the war
      clearly enough to arouse the indignation of the masses, who had
      honestly believed in the desire (and ability) of the capitalists
      to “renounce annexations”. On April 20-21 Petrograd was in a
      turmoil. The streets were crowded; day and night knots and
      groups of people stood about, and meetings of various sizes
      sprang up everywhere; big street processions and demonstrations
      went on without a break. Yesterday evening, April 21, the
      crisis, or, at any rate, the first stage of the crisis,
      apparently came to an end with the Executive Committee of the
      Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and later the Soviet
      itself, declaring themselves satisfied with the “explanations”,
      the amendments to the Note and the “elucidations” made by the
      government (which in fact boil down to empty phrases, saying
      absolutely nothing, changing nothing and committing the
      government to nothing). They considered the “incident
      settled”.


Whether the masses consider the “incident settled”, the future
      will show. Our task now is to make a careful study of the
      forces, the classes, that revealed themselves in the
      crisis, and to draw the relevant lessons for our proletarian
      party. For it is the great significance of all crises that they
      make manifest what has been hidden; they cast aside all that is
      relative, superficial, and trivial; they sweep away the
      political litter and reveal the real mainsprings of the
      class struggle.

 

Strictly speaking, the capitalist government on April 18 merely
      reiterated its previous notes, in which the imperialist war was
      invested with diplomatic equivocations. The soldiers were angry
      because they had honestly believed in the sincerity and peaceful
      intentions of the capitalists. The demonstrations began as
      soldiers’ demonstrations, under the contradictory,
      misguided and ineffectual slogan: “Down with Milyukov”
      (as though a change of persons or groups could change the
      substance of policy!).


This means that the broad, unstable, and vacillating mass, which
      is closest to the peasantry and which by its scientific class
      definition is petty-bourgeois, swung away from the
      capitalists towards the revolutionary workers. It was
      the swing or movement of this mass, strong enough to be a
      decisive factor, that caused the crisis.


It was at this point that other sections began to stir:
      not the middle but the extreme elements, not
      the intermediary petty bourgeoisie but the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat, started to come out on to the streets and
      organise.


The bourgeoisie seized Nevsky Prospekt—or “Milyukov”
      Prospekt as one paper called it—and the adjacent quarters
      of prosperous Petrograd, the Petrograd of the capitalists and
      the government officials. Officers, students, and “the middle
      classes” demonstrated in favour of the Provisional
      Government. Among the slogans, “Down with Lenin” frequently
      appeared on the banners.


The proletariat rallied in its own centres, the
      working-class suburbs, around the slogans and appeals of our
      Party’s Central Committee. On April 20-21 the Central Committee
      adopted resolutions, which were immediately passed on to the
      proletariat through the Party organisations. The workers poured
      through the poor, less central districts, and then in
      groups got through to Nevsky. By their mass character and
      solidarity, these demonstrations were very different from those
      of the bourgeoisie. Many banners carried the inscription “All
      Power to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies”.


On Nevsky there were clashes. The “hostile” demonstrations tore
      down each other’s banners. The Executive Committee received news
      by telephone from various places that there was shooting on both
      sides, that there were killed and

    

wounded; but the information
      was extremely contradictory and unconfirmed.


The bourgeoisie shouted about the “spectre of civil war”, thus
      expressing its fear that the real masses, the actual majority of
      the nation, might seize power. The petty-bourgeois leaders of
      the Soviet, the Mensheviks and Narodniks—who since the
      revolution in general, and during the crisis in particular, have
      had no definite party policy—allowed themselves to be
      intimidated. In the Executive Committee almost half the votes
      were cast against the Provisional Government on the eve of the
      crisis, but now thirty-four votes (with nineteen against) are
      cast in favour of returning to a policy of confidence
      in and agreement with the capitalists.


And the “incident” was considered “settled”.


What is the essence of the class struggle? The
      capitalists are for dragging out the war under cover of
      empty phrases and false promises. They are caught in the meshes
      of Russian, Anglo-French and American banking
      capital. The proletariat, as represented by its class-conscious
      vanguard, stands for the transfer of power to the
      revolutionary class, the working class and the
      semi-proletarians, for the development of a world
      workers’ revolution, a revolution which is clearly developing
      also in Germany, and for terminating the war by means
      of such a revolution.


The vast mass of people, chiefly the petty bourgeoisie, who
      still believe the Menshevik and Narodnik leaders and who have
      been absolutely intimidated by the bourgeoisie and are carrying
      out its policy, although with reservations, are
      swinging now to the right, now to the left.


The war is terrible; it has hit the vast mass of the people
      hardest of all; it is these people who are becoming aware,
      albeit still very vaguely, that the war is criminal, that it is
      being carried on through the rivalry and scramble of the
      capitalists, for the division of their spoils. The
      world situation is growing more and more involved. The only
      way out is a world workers’ revolution, a revolution which
      is now more advanced in Russia than in any other
      country, but which is clearly mounting (strikes, fraternisation)
      in Germany too. And the people are wavering: wavering between
      confidence in their old masters, the capitalists, and bitterness towards them; between confidence in the new class, the

    

only
      consistently revolutionary class, which opens up the prospect of
      a bright future for all the working people—the
      proletariat—and a vague awareness of its role in world
      history.


This is not the first time the petty bourgeoisie and semi
      proletarians have wavered and it will not be the
      last!


The lesson is clear, comrade workers! There is no time to be
      lost. The first crisis will be followed by others. You must
      devote all your efforts to enlightening the backward,
      to making extensive, comradely and direct contact (not only by
      meetings) with every regiment and with every group of working
      people who have not had their eyes opened yet! All your
      efforts must be devoted to consolidating your own ranks, to
      organising the workers from the bottom upwards, including every
      district, every factory, every quarter of the capital and its
      suburbs! Do not be misled by those of the petty
      bourgeoisie ’who “compromise” with the capitalists, by the
      defencists and by the “supporters”, nor by individuals who are
      inclined to be in a hurry and to shout “Down with the
      Provisional Government!” before the majority of the people are
      solidly united. The crisis cannot be over come by violence
      practised by individuals against individuals, by the local
      action of small groups of armed people, by Blanquist attempts to
      “seize power”, to “arrest” the Provisional Government, etc.


Today’s task is to explain more precise]y, more clearly, more
      widely the proletariat’s policy, its way of terminating
      the war. Rally more resolutely, more widely, wherever you can,
      to the ranks and columns of the proletariat! Rally round your
      Soviets; and within them endeavour to rally behind you a
      majority by comradely persuasion and by reelection of individual
      members!

Commenting on the resolution of the Central Committee of April
      20 concerning the necessity of transferring power to the
      revolutionary proletariat “with the support of the majority
      of the people”, today’s Dyen
      writes:



      “Very simple, then what’s the hitch? Instead of passing
      resolutions, come and take the power.”



We have here a typical example of the methods used by the
      bourgeois press. People pretend not to understand the simplest
      thing, and ensure themselves—on paper—an easy
      victory. Anybody who says “take the power” should not have to
      think long to realise that an attempt to do so without as
      yet having the backing of the majority of the people would
      be adventurism or Blanquism (Pravda
      has made a special point of warning against this in the
      clearest, most unmistakable and unequivocal terms). [See also: Blanquism]


There is a degree of freedom now in Russia that enables the will
      of the majority to be gauged by the make-up of the
      Soviets. Therefore, to make a serious, not a Blanquist, bid for
      power, the proletarian party must fight for influence
      within the Soviets.


All this has been gone over and hammered out by Pravda
      again and again, and only stupidity or malice can fail to grasp
      it. Let the reader judge for himself to which of these two
      unenviable categories Rabochaya
      Gazeta belongs when it describes the “recommendation” (made
      to the Soviet) “to take power into its own hands” as
      “irresponsible provocation”, as “demagogy, devoid of all sense
      of political responsibility,

    

light-heartedly urging democrats
      towards civil strife and war, and inciting the workers and
      soldiers not only against the government but against the Soviet
      itself” and so on.


Can one imagine a worse muddle than this, when the blame on the
      question of demagogy is laid at the wrong door?


Prime
      Minister Lvov is reported by the evening paper Birzheviye
      Vedomosti[2] for April 21 as having said literally the
      following:



      “Up till now the Provisional Government has invariably met with
      the support of the Soviet’s leading organ. During the last
      fortnight these relations have changed. The Provisional
      Government is suspect.Under the circumstances it is in no
      position to administer the state, as it is difficult to do
      anything in an atmosphere of distrust and discontent. Under
      such circumstances it would be best for the Provisional
      Government to resign. It is fully alive to its responsibility
      towards the country, in whose interests it is prepared to resign
      immediately if need be.”



Is this not clear? Is it possible not to understand why,
      after such a speech, our Central Committee proposed
      that a public opinion poll be held?


What have “civil war”, “provocation”, “demagogy” and similar
      frightening words to do with it, when the Prime Minister himself
      declares the government’s readiness “to resign” and recognises
      the Soviet as the “leading organ”?


One or the other: either Rabochaya Gazeta believes that
      in making such statements Lvov is misleading the people, in
      which case it should not urge confidence in and support of the
      government, but no confidence and no support; or
      Rabochaya Gazeta believes that Lvov is really “prepared
      to resign”, in which case, why all this outcry about civil
      war?


If Rabochaya Gazeta understands the situation
      correctly, understands that the capitalists are raising
      a hullabaloo about civil war in order to cover up their
      desire to flout the ’will of the majority by means of force,
      then why this outcry on the part of the newspaper?


Lvov is entitled to ask the Soviet to approve and accept his
      policy. Our Party is entitled to ask the Soviet to approve and
      accept our, proletarian, policy. To speak of “provocation”

    

and
      so on is to reveal an utter lack of understanding of what it is
      all about or to sink to base demagogy. We are entitled to fight
      for influence and for a majority in the Soviet and the Soviets,
      and we are going to fight for them. We repeat:


“We shall favour the transfer of power to the
    proletarians and semi-proletarians only when the Soviets of
    Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies adopt our policy and are willing
    to take the power into their own
hands.”[1]


[Resolution of the C.C. of
      the R.S.D.L.P. of April 22, 1917]

Today’s Yedinstvo
      prints on its front page in bold type a proclamation signed by
      Plekhanov,
      Deutsch, and Zasulich.
      We read:



      “Even nation has a right freely to determine its own
      destiny. Wilhelm of Germany and Karl of Austria will never agree
      to this. In waging war against them, we are defending our own
      freedom, as well as the freedom of others. Russia cannot betray
      her Allies. That would bring disgrace upon her.”



That is how all capitalists argue. To them non-observance of
      treaties between capitalists is a disgrace, just as to
      monarchs non-observance of treaties between monarchs is a
      disgrace.


What about the workers? Do they regard non-observance of
      treaties concluded by monarchs and capitalists a disgrace?


Of course not! Class-conscious workers are for
      scrapping all such treaties, they are for recognising
      only such agreements between the workers and soldiers of
      all countries as would benefit the people, i.e., not the
      capitalists, but the workers and poor peasants.


The workers of the world have a treaty of their own,
      namely, the Basle Manifesto of 1912 (signed, among others, by
      Plekhanov and betrayed by him). This workers’ “treaty” calls it
      a “crime” for workers of different countries to shoot at each
      other for the sake of the capitalists’ profits.


The writers in Yedinstvo argue like capitalists (so do
      Rech and others), and not like workers.


It is quite true that neither the German monarch nor the
      Austrian will agree to freedom for every nation, as

    

both these
      monarchs are crowned brigands, and so was Nicholas II. Nor, for
      one thing, are the English, Italian, and other monarchs (the
      “Allies” of Nicholas II) any better. To forget this is to become
      a monarchist or a defender of the monarchists.


Secondly, the uncrowned brigands, i.e., the
      capitalists, have shown themselves in the present war to be no
      better than the monarchs. Has not American “democracy”, i.e.,
      the democratic capitalists, robbed the Philippines, and does it
      not rob Mexico?


The German Guchkovs and Milyukovs, if they were to take the
      place of Wilhelm II, would be brigands, too, no better
      than the British and Russian capitalists.


Third, will the Russian capitalists “agree” to “freedom” for
      nations which they themselves oppress: Armenia, Khiva, Ukraine,
      Finland?


By evading this question the Yedinstvo writers are, in
      effect, turning into defenders of “our own” capitalists in their
      predatory war with other capitalists.


The internationalist workers of the world stand for the
      overthrow of all capitalist governments, for the
      rejection of all agreements and understandings with any
      capitalists, for universal peace concluded by the
      revolutionary workers of all countries, a peace capable of
      giving real freedom to “every” nation.

We believe the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies at the present moment represents the majority of the
      workers and soldiers. On our part, we (Bolsheviks)
      are working for influence and a majority in the Petrograd Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and in all the local
      Soviets. We advise the workers and soldiers to re-elect members
      of the Soviets who do not fully represent the will of the
      majority.


So far the majority of the Soviet follows the Narodnik
      and Menshevik
      leaders.


We have no doubt that the Soviet
      will be able to retain power so long as it is supported by a
      considerable and strong majority of workers and soldiers. The
      more so as that power, instead of dragging on the war, would
      bring it to a speedy end on terms most favourable to the
      masses. We also believe that the Soviet, being a body elected by
      the workers and soldiers, can definitely win over the
      overwhelming majority of workers and soldiers.


Whether or not the capitalist government will refuse to convoke
      the Constituent Assembly will depend upon the development and
      strength of the counter-revolution. The elements of such a
      counter-revolution without doubt already exist.


Ending the war by a truly democratic peace depends upon the
      course which the revolution of the world proletariat will
      take. This revolution has gained good ground now in Russia, and
      is undoubtedly gaining ground in Germany (mass strikes,
      fraternisation).

Rabochaya
      Gazeta gloats and crows over the recent resolution of the
      Central Committee which has revealed (in connection, be it
      noted, with the now published declaration of the representatives
      of the Bolshevik group in the Soviet) certain disagreements
      within our Party.


The Mensheviks
      may gloat and crow as much as they like. It does not worry us in
      the least. The Mensheviks have no organisation. Chkheidze
      and Tsereteli
      are one thing—they are ministers without portfolios; the Organising
      Committee is another thing—they are Social-Democrats
      without a policy; the “defencists” are a third thing—they
      support Plekhanov.
      Martov
      is a fourth thing—he will not support the loan. Small
      wonder that people who have neither an organisation nor a party
      crow and caper light-heartedly at discovering a fault in
      somebody else’s organisation.


We have no reason to fear the truth. Yes, comrade workers, the
      crisis has revealed certain shortcomings in our organisation. We
      must set to work to correct them!


The crisis revealed a very feeble attempt to move “slightly
      leftward” of the Central Committee. Our Central Committee did
      not yield, and we do not doubt for a moment that harmony within
      our Party is already being restored, a harmony that is
      voluntary, intelligent, and complete.


Every day proves the soundness of our line. To put it through
      effectively, the proletarian masses must be thrice as
      well organised as they are now. Every district, every block,
      every factory, every military company must have a strong,
      close-knit organisation capable of acting as one
      man. Each such organisation must have direct ties with the
      centre, with the Central Committee, and those ties must be

    

      strong, so that the enemy may not break them at the first blow;
      those ties must be permanent, must be strengthened and tested
      every day and every hour, so that the enemy does not catch
      us unawares.


Comrade workers! Let us build a strong proletarian mass
      organisation everywhere, from the bottom up, both among the
      working-class mass and in the army, and let us start lt
      immediately. We shall not be put out by the malicious glee of
      our enemies, we shall not be daunted by occasional errors and
      shortcomings. We shall correct them. The future is working for
      us.

      Speech Delivered at the Opening

     of the Conference

     April 24 (May 7)
   

Comrades, we are assembled here as the
      first conference of the proletarian party, in conditions of the
      Russian revolution and a developing world revolution as
      well. The time is approaching when the assertion of the founders
      of scientific socialism, and the unanimous forecast of the
      socialists who gathered at the Basle Congress, that world war
      would inevitably lead to revolution, is being everywhere proved
      correct.
    

In the nineteenth century Marx and Engels, following the
      proletarian movements in various countries and analysing the
      possible prospects for a social revolution, repeatedly stated
      that the roles would, in general, be distributed among these
      countries in proportion to, and in accordance with, their
      historically conditioned national features. They expressed their
      idea briefly as: The French worker will begin, the German will
      finish it.
    

The great honour of beginning the revolution has fallen to the
      Russian proletariat. But the Russian proletariat must not forget
      that its movement and revolution are only part of a world
      revolutionary proletarian movement, which in Germany, for
      example, is gaining momentum with every passing day. Only from
      this angle can we define our tasks.
    

I declare the All-Russia Conference open. Please nominate your
      candidates for election to the Presiding Committee.

      Report on the Current Situation

     April 24 (May 7)
   

Comrades, in evaluating the current
      situation I have to deal with an exceedingly broad subject,
      which, to my mind, falls into three parts. First, the estimate
      of the political situation proper here in Russia, our attitude
      towards the government and the dual power that has come into
      existence; second, our attitude towards the war; third, the
      international background to the working-class movement, a
      situation which has brought the workers of the world face to
      face with a socialist revolution.


I think, I shall have to deal only in brief with some of the
      points. Furthermore, I am going to submit to you a draft
      resolution on all these questions with this reservation,
      however, that, owing to the extreme lack of facilities and to
      the political crisis that has been created here in Petrograd, we
      were unable to have discussions of the resolution, or to
      communicate it in good time to the local comrades. I repeat,
      then, that these are only preliminary drafts, designed to make
      work easier in the committee and concentrate it on a few of the
      most essential questions.


I begin with the first question. If I am not mistaken, the
      Moscow Conference adopted the same resolution as the Petrograd
      City Conference. [Interruption: “With amendments.”] I
      have not seen the amendments, and I cannot pass an opinion. But
      since the Petrograd resolution was published in Pravda,
      I shall take it for granted, if no one objects, that it is known
      to everybody here. I submit this as a draft resolution to the
      present All-Russia Conference.


Most of the parties in the petty-bourgeois
      bloc controlling the Petrograd Soviet represent our policy, in
      contrast

    

to their own, as a rash policy. What distinguishes our
      policy is our demand above all for a precise class analysis of
      current events. The chief sin of the petty-bourgeois bloc is
      that it resorts to empty phrases to conceal from the people the
      truth about the government’s class character.


If the Moscow comrades have any amendments, they may present
      them now.


      (Reads the resolution of the Petrograd City Conference on
      the attitude towards the Provisional Government.)


  “Considering:


      “(1) that the Provisional
      Government, by its class character, is the organ of the
      landowner and bourgeois domination;


      “(2) that the Provisional Government and the classes it
      represents are bound with indissoluble economic and political
      ties to Russian and Anglo-French imperialism;


      “(3) that the Provisional Government is carrying out its
      proclaimed programme only partially, and only under pressure of
      the revolutionary proletariat and, to some extent, of the petty
      bourgeoisie;


      “(4) that the forces of bourgeois and landowner counter
      revolution, now being organised, have already, under cover of
      the Provisional Government and with the latter’s obvious
      connivance, launched an attack on revolutionary democracy;


      “(5) that the Provisional Government is avoiding fixing the date
      for the elections to the Constituent Assembly, preventing the
      arming of the people as a whole, opposing the transfer of all
      the land to the people, foisting upon it the landowners’ way of
      settling the agrarian question, obstructing the introduction of
      an eight-hour workday, condoning counter-revolutionary
      propaganda in the army (by Guchkov and Co.), rallying the
      high-ranking officers against the soldiers, etc....”


I have read the first part of the resolution giving a class
      definition of the Provisional Government. There are scarcely any
      essential differences between this resolution and that of the
      Moscow comrades, as far as it is possible to judge from the
      latter’s text alone. But the general definition of the
      government as counter-revolutionary is, in my opinion,
      incorrect. If we speak in general terms, we must specify which
      revolution we mean. As far as the bourgeois revolution

    

is
      concerned, this cannot be said, because that revolution is
      already completed. As far as the proletarian and peasant
      revolution is concerned, such a statement is premature, for we
      cannot be sure that the peasants will necessarily go farther
      than the bourgeoisie. To express our confidence in the peasants,
      particularly now that they have turned to imperialism and
      defencism, i. e., to supporting the war, is, in my opinion,
      unsound. at the present moment the peasants have entered into a
      number of agreements with the Cadets. That is why I regard this
      clause in the Moscow resolution as politically incorrect. We
      want the peasants to go farther than the bourgeoisie, we want
      them to take the land from the landowners, but so far we can say
      nothing definite about their future conduct.


We studiously avoid the words “revolutionary democracy”. We may
      use them when there is a question of an attack by the
      government, but at the present moment they are highly deceptive,
      for it is very difficult to distinguish the classes which have
      mingled in this chaos. Our task is to free those who are
      trailing behind. The Soviets are important to us not as a form;
      to us it is important what classes they represent. We must,
      therefore, do a great deal of work to develop the
      class-consciousness of the proletariat....


  (Resumes reading the resolution.)
  

      “(6) that this government, at the same time, is relying at
      present on the confidence of, and, to a certain extent, on an
      actual agreement with, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies, which now unites an obvious majority of
      workers and soldiers, i. e., peasants;


      “(7) that every step of the Provisional Government, in both its
      domestic and foreign policies, is bound to open the eyes, not
      only of the proletarians in town and country and the
      semi-proletarians, but also of the broad sections of the petty
      bourgeoisie, to the real nature of this government,


   “the Conference resolves that:

“(1) in order to ensure all the state power passing
      into the hands of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
      or other bodies directly expressing the will of the people,
      prolonged work is necessary to develop proletarian
      class-consciousness and to unite the urban and rural
      proletarians

    

against the vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie,
      for only work of this nature can guarantee real advance on the
      part of the whole revolutionary people;


      “(2) this calls for many-sided activity within the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, for work aimed at in creasing
      the number of these Soviets, consolidating their power, and
      welding together our Party’s proletarian internationalist groups
      in the Soviets;


      “(3) we must organise our Social-Democratic forces more
      effectively, so as to be able to direct the new wave of the
      revolutionary movement under the banner of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy.”


This is the sum and substance of our policy. The whole petty
      bourgeoisie is now wavering and trying to conceal this wavering
      behind the empty phrase about revolutionary democracy. We must
      contrapose these waverings with a proletarian line. The
      counter-revolutionaries wish to frustrate it by premature
      action. Our task is to increase the number of Soviets, to
      reinforce them and to consolidate the unity of our Party.


The Moscow comrades have added to Point 3 the demand for
      control. This control is represented by Chkheidze,
      Steklov, Tsereteli,
      and other leaders of the petty-bourgeois bloc. Control without
      power is an empty phrase. How can I control Britain? To control
      her, you would have to seize her fleet. I can understand the
      uneducated mass of workers and soldiers naïvely and
      unconsciously believing in control. You only have to think about
      the fundamental aspects of control, however, to realise that
      such a belief is a departure from the basic principles of the
      class struggle. What is control? If I write a paper, or a
      resolution, they will write a counter-resolution. To control,
      you must have power. If the broad mass of the petty-bourgeois
      bloc do not understand this, we must have the patience to
      explain it to them, but under no circumstances must we tell them
      a lie. If, however, I obscure this fundamental condition by
      speaking of control, then I am guilty of telling a lie and am
      playing into the hands of the capitalists and the
      imperialists. “You’re welcome to your control, but we’ll have
      the guns. Enjoy your control,” they say. They know that at the
      moment the people cannot be denied their demand. Control without

    

power is an empty petty-bourgeois phrase that hampers the
      progress of the Russian revolution. That is why I object to the
      Moscow comrades’ third point.


As for this peculiar interlocking of two powers, in which the
      Provisional Government, lacking power, guns, soldiers, and the
      armed mass of people, leans on the Soviets that are relying so
      far on promises and are carrying out a policy of upholding those
      promises, if you want to play this game, you are doomed to
      failure. Our task is to keep out of this game. We shall carry on
      our work of explaining to the proletariat the unsoundness of
      this policy, and events, at every turn, will prove the
      correctness of our position. So far we are in the minority; the
      masses still do not believe us. We can wait; they will side with
      us when the government shows its face. The government’s
      vacillations may repel them and they will swing over to our
      side; and then, taking into consideration the balance of forces,
      we shall say: Our time has come.


I now pass on to the question of the war. This question actually
      united us when we came out against the loan, the attitude
      towards which showed immediately and clearly the alignment of
      political forces. As Rech has stated, everybody, except
      Yedinstvo, is wavering; the entire petty bourgeoisie is
      for the loan—with reservations. The capitalists make a wry
      face and pocket the resolution with a smile, saying: “You may do
      the talking, but we shall do the acting.” All those now voting
      for the loan are known as social-chauvinists the world over.


I shall now proceed to read the resolution on the war. It is in
      three parts:

    
      (1) a characterisation of the war from the point of view of its
      class significance; (2) the revolutionary defencism of the
      masses, something that cannot be found in any other
      country; (3) how to end the war.
    

Many of us, myself included, have had occasion to address the
      people, particularly the soldiers, and it seems to me that when
      everything is explained to them from the class point of view,
      there is one thing in our stand on which they are most unclear,
      namely, in what way we intend to end the war, in what way we
      think it possible to stop it. The masses are in a maze of
      misunderstanding, there is complete ignorance about our stand;
      that is why we must express ourselves most clearly on this. 
 

  (Reads the draft resolution on the war.)
    

      “The present war is, on the part of both groups of the
      belligerent powers, an imperialist war, i. e., one waged by the
      capitalists for world domination, for division of the
      capitalists’ spoils, for profitable markets for finance and
      banking capital, and for the subjugation of the weaker
      nationalities.
    

      “The transfer of state power in Russia from Nicholas II to the
      government of Guchkov, Lvov, and others, to the government of
      the landowners and capitalists, did not and could not alter the
      class character and meaning of the war as far as Russia is
      concerned.
    

      “The fact that the new government is carrying on the same
      imperialist war, i. e., an aggressive war of conquest, became
      glaringly apparent when the government not only failed to
      publish the secret treaties between ex-Tsar Nicholas II and the
      capitalist governments of Britain, France, etc., but even
      formally confirmed these treaties. This was done without
      consulting the will of the people and with the express purpose
      of deceiving them, for it is well known that the secret treaties
      concluded by the ex-tsar are outrageously predatory treaties
      that give the Russian capitalists a free hand to rob China,
      Persia, Turkey, Austria, etc.
    

      “For this reason no proletarian party that does not wish to
      break completely with internationalism, i. e., with the
      fraternal solidarity of the workers of all countries in their
      struggle against the yoke of Capital, can support the present
      war, or the present government, or its loans, no matter in what
      glowing terms these loans may be described.
    

      “Nor can any trust be placed in the present government’s promise
      to renounce annexations, i. e., the conquest of foreign
      countries or the forcible retention of any nationality within
      the confines of Russia. For, in the first place, the
      capitalists, bound together by the thousand threads of Russian
      and Anglo-French banking capital, and intent on protecting the
      interests of capital, cannot renounce annexations in this war
      without at the same time ceasing to be capitalists, without
      renouncing the profits from the thousands of millions invested
      in loans, concessions, war industries, etc. And secondly, the
      new-government, after renouncing

    

annexations to mislead the
      people, declared through Milyukov (Moscow, April 9, 1917) that
      it had no intention of renouncing them. Finally, as revealed by
      Dyelo Naroda, a newspaper in which Minister Kerensky
      co-operates, Milyukov has not even sent his statement on the
      renunciation of annexations to other countries.
    

      “Therefore, in warning the people against the capitalists’ empty
      promises, the Conference declares that it is necessary to make a
      clear distinction between a renunciation of annexations in word
      and a renunciation of annexations in deed, i. e., the immediate
      publication of all the secret predatory treaties, of all acts of
      foreign policy, and the taking of immediate steps to fully
      liberate all peoples who are being oppressed, kept bound to
      Russia by force or kept in a state of subjection by the
      capitalist class, which is continuing the policy of ex-Tsar
      Nicholas II, a policy that is a disgrace to our nation.”


The second half of this part of the resolution deals with the
      promises made by the government. For a Marxist, perhaps, this
      part is superfluous; for the people, however, it is
      important. That is why we must add the reasons why we do not
      believe those promises, why we must not trust the
      government. The present government’s promises to abandon its
      imperialist policy are not to be trusted. Our policy in this
      respect should not be in saying that we demand that the
      government publish the treaties. This would be a vain hope. To
      demand this of a capitalist government would be like demanding
      an exposure of commercial swindling. When we say that it is
      necessary to renounce annexations and indemnities, we should
      indicate how this can be done; and if we are asked who can do
      it, our answer will be that this step is by its very nature a
      revolutionary one, a step which only the revolutionary
      proletariat can make. Otherwise these promises will remain empty
      pledges and wishes used by the capitalists to keep the people in
      leading-strings.


      (Continues reading the draft resolution.)

“The ’revolutionary defencism’, which in Russia has
      now permeated almost all the Narodnik parties (the Popular
      Socialists, Trudoviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries), the
      opportunist party of the Menshevik Social-Democrats (the

    

Organising Committee, Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.), and the
      majority of the non-party revolutionaries, reflects, in point of
      class significance, the interests and point of view of the petty
      bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, and the well-to-do peasants,
      who, like the capitalists, profit by oppressing weak peoples. on
      the other hand, it is a result of the deception of the masses by
      the capitalists, who instead of publishing the secret treaties
      confine themselves to promises and glib talk.


      “It must be admitted that the great mass of ’revolutionary
      defencists’ are honest, i. e., they are really opposed
      to annexations, to conquests, to oppressing weak peoples; they
      are really working for a democratic, non-coercive peace
      among all the belligerents. This must be admitted for the reason
      that the class position of the urban and rural proletarians and
      semi-proletarians (i. e., of the people who earn their living,
      wholly or partly, by selling their labour-power to the
      capitalists) makes these classes uninterested in capitalist
      profits.


      “Therefore, while recognising that any concessions to
      ’revolutionary defencism’ are absolutely impermissible and
      virtually signify a complete break with internationalism and
      socialism, the Conference declares that our Party will preach
      abstention from violence as long as the Russian capitalists and
      their Provisional Government confine themselves to threats of
      violence against the people (for example, Guchkov’s unhappily
      notorious decree threatening the soldiers with punishment for
      arbitrary displacement of superiors), as long as the capitalists
      have not started using violence against the Soviets of
      Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, Agricultural Labourers’, and
      other Deputies, which organise themselves freely, and freely
      elect and dismiss all public officers. Our Party will
      fight against the profound and fatal error of ’revolutionary
      defencism’ solely by means of comradely persuasion, bringing
      home the truth that the attitude of unreasoning trust of the
      broad masses in the government of the capitalists, who are the
      worst enemies of peace and socialism, is, in present-day Russia,
      the chief obstacle to a speedy termination of the war.”


Some of the petty bourgeoisie have an interest in this policy of
      the capitalists—of that there can be no doubt. That

    

is why
      it would be wrong for the proletarian party at present to place
      any hopes in the community of interests of the proletariat and
      the peasantry. We are fighting to win the peasants over to our
      side, but they are, to a certain extent, consciously on the side
      of the capitalists.


There is not the slightest doubt that, as a class, the
      proletariat and semi-proletariat are not interested in the
      war. They are influenced by tradition and deception. They still
      lack political experience. Therefore, our task is one of patient
      explanation. We make no concessions to them on matters of
      principle; yet we cannot look upon them as
      social-chauvinists. This section of the population has never
      been socialist, nor has it the slightest idea about socialism,
      it is only just awakening to political life. Nevertheless, its
      class-consciousness is growing and broadening with extraordinary
      rapidity. We must be able to bring our views home to it, and
      this is now the most difficult task of all, particularly for a
      party that only yesterday worked underground.


Some may ask: Have we not gone back on our own principles? We
      were advocating the conversion of the imperialist war into a
      civil war, and now we are contradicting ourselves. But the first
      civil war in Russia has come to an end; we are now advancing
      towards the second war—the war between imperialism and the
      armed people. In this transitional period, as long as the armed
      force is in the hands of the soldiers, as long as Milyukov and
      Guchkov have not yet resorted to violence, this civil war, so
      far as we are concerned, turns into peaceful, prolonged, and
      patient class propaganda. To speak of civil war before people
      have come to realise the need for it is undoubtedly to lapse
      into Blanquism. We are for civil war, but only for civil war
      waged by a politically conscious class. He can be overthrown who
      is known to the people as an oppressor. There are no oppressors
      in Russia at present; it is the soldiers and not the capitalists
      who now have the guns and rifles; the capitalists are getting
      what they want now not by force but by deception, and to shout
      about violence now is senseless. One must be able to uphold the
      Marxist point of view, which says that this conversion of
      imperialist war into a civil war should be based on objective,
      and not subjective, conditions. For the time being we withdraw
      that slogan, but only for the time being. It is the

    

soldiers and
      the workers who possess the arms now, not the capitalists. So
      long as the government has not started war, our propaganda
      remains peaceful.


The government would like to see us make the first imprudent
      move towards revolutionary action, as this would be to its
      advantage. It is exasperated because our Party has put forward
      the slogan of peaceful demonstrations. We must not cede one iota
      of our principles to the petty bourgeoisie, which is now marking
      time. The proletarian party would be making a dangerous mistake
      if it based its tactics on subjective desires where organisation
      is required. We cannot say that the majority is with us; what we
      need in the present situation is caution, caution, caution. To
      base proletarian tactics on subjective desires means to condemn
      it to failure.


The third point deals with the question of how to end the
      war. The Marxist point of view is well known, but the difficulty
      is how to bring it home to the masses in the clearest form
      possible. We are not pacifists, and we cannot repudiate a
      revolutionary war. In what way does a revolutionary war differ
      from a capitalist war? The difference is, above all, a class
      difference: which class is interested in the war? What policy
      does the interested class pursue in that war? ...In addressing
      the people we must give concrete answers to their questions. And
      so the first question is how to distinguish a revolutionary war
      from a capitalist war. The ordinary man in the street does not
      grasp the distinction, he does not understand that it is a
      matter of class distinction. We must not confine ourselves to
      theory alone, we must demonstrate in practice that we shall wage
      a really revolutionary war only when the proletariat is in
      power. I think that by presenting the question this way we are
      giving the clearest possible answer to the question as to what
      this war is about and who is waging it.


Pravda has published the draft of
      an appeal to the soldiers of all the belligerent
      countries.[1]

We have received information that fraternisation
      is taking place at the front, but this fraternisation is as yet
      politically semi-conscious. What it lacks is a clear political
      idea. The soldiers have come to feel instinctively that action
      must come from below.

    

    
The class instinct of these revolutionary-minded people has
      suggested this path to them as being the only correct path. For
      a revolution, however, this is insufficient. We want to give a
      clear-cut political answer. In order to put an end to this war,
      state power must pass to the revolutionary class. I suggest that
      an appeal to the soldiers of all the belligerent countries be
      drawn up in the name of the Conference and published in all the
      appropriate languages. If, instead of all these hard-worked
      phrases about peace conferences, half of whose members are
      secret or open agents of the imperialist governments, we send
      out this appeal, we shall achieve our purpose a thousand times
      quicker than we would by all those peace conferences. We refuse
      to have any dealings with the German Plekhanovs. When we were
      passing through Germany, those gentlemen, the
      social-chauvinists, the German Plekhanovs, tried to get into our
      carriage, but we told them that we would not allow a single one
      of them in and that if any of them did get in they would not get
      out again without our having a big row. Had a man like Karl
      Liebknecht been permitted to come to see us, we would certainly
      have talked matters over with him. When we issue our appeal to
      the working people of all countries, giving  an answer to the
      question of how to end the war, and when the soldiers read our
      answer showing a political way out of the war, then
      fraternisation will make tremendous strides. This must be done
      in order to raise fraternisation from the level of an
      instinctive revulsion against war to a clear political
      understanding of how to get out of it.


I now pass on to the third question, namely, the analysis of the
      current situation with reference to the position of the
      international working-class movement and that of international
      capitalism. From the point of view of Marxism, in discussing
      imperialism it is absurd to restrict oneself to conditions in
      one country alone, since all capitalist countries are closely
      bound together. Now, in time of war, this bond has grown
      immeasurably stronger. All humanity is thrown into a tangled
      bloody heap from which no nation can extricate itself on its
      own. Though there are more and less advanced countries, this war
      has bound them all together by so many threads that escape from
      this tangle for any single country acting on its own is
      inconceivable.
 

We are all agreed that power must be wielded by the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. But what can and should they do
      if power passes to them, i. e., if power is in the hands of the
      proletarians and semi-proletarians? This is an involved and
      difficult situation. Speaking of the transfer of power, there is
      a danger—one that played a big part in previous
      revolutions, too—namely, the danger that the revolutionary
      class will not know what to do with state power when it has won
      it. The history of revolutions gives us examples of revolutions
      that failed for this very reason. The Soviets of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies, which cover the whole of Russia with their
      network, now stand at the centre of the revolution; it seems to
      me, however, that we have not sufficiently studied or understood
      them. Should they take over the power, it will no longer be a
      state in the ordinary sense of the word. The world has seen no
      such state power functioning for any considerable length of
      time, but the whole world’s labour movement has been approaching
      it. This would be a state of the Paris
      Commune type. Such power is a dictatorship, i. e., it rests
      not on law, not on the formal will of the majority, but on
      direct, open force. Force is the instrument of power. How, then,
      will the Soviets apply this power? Will they return to the old
      way of governing by means of the police? Will they govern by
      means of the old organs of power? In my opinion they cannot do
      this. At any rate, they will be faced with the immediate task of
      creating a state that is not bourgeois. Among Bolsheviks, I have
      compared this state to the Paris Commune in the sense that the
      latter destroyed the old administrative organs and replaced them
      by absolutely new ones that were the direct organs of the
      workers. I am accused of having now used a word which the
      capitalists fear most of all, as they have begun to interpret it
      as a desire for the immediate introduction of socialism. I have
      used it, however, only in the sense of replacing the old organs
      by new, proletarian ones. Marx saw in this the greatest advance
      of the entire world proletarian
movement.[2] The question
      of the social tasks of the proletariat is of the greatest
      practical significance to us, first, because we are now tied up
      with all the other countries, and are unable to disentangle
      ourselves—the proletariat will either break free as a whole

    

or it will be



crushed; secondly, the existence of Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies is a fact. No one doubts that
      they cover the whole of Russia, that they are a state power and
      that there can be no other power. If that is so, we should form
      a clear idea as to what use they can make of that power. Some
      people say that it is the same type of power as in France or
      America, but they have nothing of the kind there; such a direct
      power does not exist there.


The resolution on the current situation is in three parts. The
      first defines the objective situation created by the imperialist
      war, the position in which world capitalism finds itself; the
      second deals with the state of the international proletarian
      movement; the third deals with the tasks of the Russian working
      class when power passes into its hands. In the first part I
      formulate the conclusion that during the war capitalism has
      developed even more than before the war. It has already taken
      over entire fields of production. Twenty seven years ago, in
      1891, when the Germans adopted their Erfurt
      Programme,[3]


Engels said that one could not continue to define
      capitalism as a system of production lacking
planning.[4]
This is now out of date; once there are trusts there
      can no longer be lack of planning. Capitalism has made gigantic
      strides, particularly in the twentieth century, and the war has
      done more than was done for twenty-five years. State control of
      industry has made progress in Britain as well as in
      Germany. Monopoly, in general, has evolved into state
      monopoly. The objective state of affairs has shown that the war
      has stepped up capitalist development, which has moved forward
      from capitalism to imperialism, from monopoly to state
      control. All this has brought the socialist revolution nearer
      and has created the objective conditions for it. Thus the
      socialist revolution has been brought closer as a result of the
      war.


Before the war Britain enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than
      any other country in the world, a point which politicians of the
      Cadet type have always stressed. There was freedom there because
      there was no revolutionary movement there. The war wrought an
      instant change. In a country where for decades no attempt was
      ever made to encroach upon the freedom of the socialist press, a
      typically tsarist censorship was immediately established, and
      all the prisons were

    

filled with socialists. For centuries the capitalists there had
      learned to rule the people without the use of force, and if they
      have resorted to force, it means that they feel that the
      revolutionary movement is growing, that they cannot act
      otherwise. When we said that Liebknecht represented the masses,
      although he was one against a hundred German Plekhanovs, we were
      told that that was a utopian idea, an illusion. Yet, anyone who
      has, if only once, attended workers’ meetings abroad knows that
      the sympathy of the masses for Liebknecht is an undeniable
      fact. His bitterest opponents had to manoeuvre when facing the
      public, and if they did not pretend to be his supporters,
      neither did they dare to come out against him. Now things have
      gone still farther. We now have mass strikes, we have
      fraternisation at the front. To attempt prophecy in this respect
      would be a great mistake, but we cannot get away from the fact
      that sympathy for the International is growing, that
      revolutionary unrest is beginning in the German army. This is a
      fact which shows that the revolution in Germany is mounting.


What, then, are the tasks of the revolutionary proletariat? The
      main flaw, the main error, in all the socialists’ arguments is
      that this question is put in too general a form, as the question
      of the transition to socialism. What we should talk about,
      however, are concrete steps and measures. Some of them are ripe,
      and some are not. We are now at a transition stage. Clearly, we
      have brought to the fore new forms, unlike those in bourgeois
      states. The Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies are a
      form of state which does not exist and never did exist in any
      country. This form represents the first steps towards socialism
      and is inevitable at the beginning of a socialist society. This
      is a fact of decisive importance. The Russian revolution has
      created the Soviets. No bourgeois country in the world has or
      can have such state institutions. No socialist revolution can be
      operative with any other state power than this. The Soviets must
      take power not for the purpose of building an ordinary bourgeois
      republic, nor for the purpose of making a direct transition to
      socialism. This cannot be. What, then, is the purpose? The
      Soviets must take power in order to make the first concrete
      steps towards this transition, steps that can and should be made



      . In this respect fear is the worst enemy. The

    

masses must be
      urged to take these steps immediately, otherwise the power of
      the Soviets will have no meaning and will give the people
      nothing.


I shall now attempt to answer the question as to what concrete
      measures we can suggest to the people without running counter to
      our Marxist convictions.


Why do we want the power to pass to the Soviets of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies?


The first measure the Soviets must carry out is the
      nationalisation of the land. All the peoples are talking about
      nationalisation. Some say it is a most utopian measure;
      nevertheless, everybody comes to accept it, because
      landownership in Russia is so complicated that the only way out
      is to remove all boundary lines dividing the land and make it
      the property of the state. Private ownership of land must be
      abolished. That is the task confronting us, because the majority
      of the people are in favour of it. To accomplish it we need the
      Soviets. This measure cannot be carried out with the help of the
      old government officials.


The second measure. We cannot be for “introducing”
      socialism—this would be the height of absurdity. We must
      preach socialism. The majority of the population in Russia are
      peasants, small farmers who can have no idea of socialism. But
      what objections can they have to a bank being set up in each
      village to enable them to improve their farming? They can say
      nothing against it. We must put over these practical measures to
      the peasants in our propaganda, and make the peasants realise
      that they are necessary.


Quite another thing is the Sugar Syndicate. This is a clear
      fact. Here our proposal must be direct and practical: these
      already fully developed syndicates must be taken over by the
      state. If the Soviets intend to assume power, it is only for
      such ends. There is no other reason why they should do so. The
      alternative is: either the Soviets develop further, or they die
      an ignominious death as in the case of the Paris Commune. If it
      is a bourgeois republic that is needed, this can very well be
      left to the Cadets.

I shall conclude by referring to a speech which impressed me
      most. I heard a coal miner deliver a remarkable speech. Without
      using a single bookish word, he told us how they had made the
      revolution. Those miners were not concerned with

    

the question as
      to whether or not they should have a president. They seized the
      mine, and the important question to them was how to keep the
      cables intact so that production might not be interrupted. Then
      came the question of bread, which was scarce, and the miners
      also agreed on the method of obtaining it. Now that is a real
      programme of the revolution, not derived from books. That is
      what I call really winning power locally.


Nowhere is the bourgeoisie so well established as in
      Petrograd. Here the capitalists have the power in their
      hands. But throughout the country, the peasants, without
      pursuing any socialist tasks, are carrying out purely practical
      measures. I think that only this programme of the revolutionary
      movement indicates the true path of the revolution. We are for
      these measures being started on with the greatest caution and
      circumspection. But it is only these measures that must be
      carried out; we should go ahead in this direction only. There is
      no other way out. Unless this is done the Soviets will be broken
      up and will die an ignominious death. But if the revolutionary
      proletariat should actually win power, it will only be for the
      sake of going forward. And to go forward means to take definite
      steps to get us out of the war—words alone won’t do it. The
      complete success of these steps is only possible by world
      revolution, if the revolution kills the war, if the workers of
      the whole world support the revolution. Taking power is,
      therefore, the only practical measure and the only way out.

      Speech Winding Up The Debate on the Report on the Current Situation

      April 24 (May 7)
    

Comrade Kamenev
      was quick to seize on the talk of adventurism. I shall have to
      dwell on this. Comrade Kamenev is convinced and asserts that in
      opposing the slogan “Down with the Provisional Government”, we
      showed vacillation. I agree with him; there certainly has been
      vacillation away from revolutionary policy, and this vacillation
      must be avoided. I think that our differences with Comrade
      Kamenev are not very great, because by agreeing with us he has
      changed his position. In what did our adventurism consist? It
      was the attempt to resort to forcible measures. We did not know
      to what extent the masses had swung to our side during that
      anxious moment. If it had been a strong swing things would have
      been different. We advanced the slogan for peaceful
      demonstrations, but several comrades from the Petrograd
      Committee issued a different slogan. We cancelled it, but were
      too late to prevent the masses from following the slogan of the
      Petrograd Committee. We say that the slogan “Down with the
      Provisional Government” is an adventurist slogan, that the
      government cannot be overthrown now. That is why we have
      advanced the slogan for peaceful demonstrations. All we wanted
      was a peaceful reconnoitring of the enemy’s forces; we did not
      want to give battle. But the Petrograd Committee turned a trifle
      more to the left, which in this case is certainly a very grave
      crime. Our organisational apparatus proved weak—our
      decisions are not being carried out by everyone. Together with
      the correct slogan “Long Live the Soviets of Workers’ and

    

Soldiers’ Deputies!” stood the incorrect slogan “Down with the
      Provisional Government”. At the time of action, to go a “trifle
      more to the left” was wrong. We regard this as a very serious
      crime, as disorganisation. Had we deliberately allowed such an
      act, we would not have remained in the Central Committee for one
      moment. It happened because of the weakness of our
      organisational apparatus. Yes, there were shortcomings in our
      organisation. We have raised the question of improving our
      organisation.


The Mensheviks
      and Co. are working the word “adventurism” as hard as they
      can. But it is they, of all people, who had neither an
      organisation nor a policy. We have both an organisation and a
      policy.


At that moment the bourgeoisie mobilised all its forces; the
      centre hid itself, and we organised a peaceful demonstration. We
      were the only ones who had a political line. Did we make
      mistakes? We did. Only he who does nothing never errs. Perfect
      organisation is a difficult thing.


Now about control.


We are at one with Comrade Kamenev, except on the question of
      control. He views control as a political act. Subjectively,
      however, he understands this word better than Chkheidze and
      others. We will not accept control. People tell us that we have
      isolated ourselves, that, by uttering a lot of terrible words
      about communism, we have frightened the bourgeoisie into
      fits....Maybe! But it was not this that isolated us. It was the
      question of the loan that caused our isolation. It was on this
      question that we found ourselves in the minority. Yes, we are in
      the minority. Well, what of it? To be a socialist while
      chauvinism is the craze means to be in the minority. To be in
      the majority means to be a chauvinist. at the moment the
      peasant, together with Milyukov, is hitting socialism by means
      of the loan. The peasant follows Milyukov and Guchkov. This is a
      fact. The bourgeois-democratic dictatorship of the peasantry is
      an old formula.


If we want to draw the peasantry into the revolution we must
      keep the proletariat apart from it in a separate proletarian
      party, because the peasantry is chauvinistic. To attract the
      peasant now means to surrender to the mercies of Milyukov.

 

The Provisional Government must be overthrown, but not now, and
      not in the usual way. We agree with Comrade Kamenev. But we must
      explain. It is this word that Comrade Kamenev has been harping
      on. Nevertheless, this is the only thing we can do.


Comrade Rykov
      says that socialism must come from other countries with a more
      developed industry. But that is not so. Nobody can say who will
      begin it and who will end it. That is not Marxism; it is a
      parody of Marxism.


Marx said that France would begin it and Germany would finish
      it. But the Russian proletariat has achieved more than anybody
      else.


If we had said, “No tsar, but a dictatorship of the
      proletariat”, well, this would have meant skipping over the
      petty bourgeoisie. But what we are saying is—help the
      revolution through the Soviets.
      We must not lapse into reformism.
      We are fighting to win, not to lose. At the worst we count on
      partial success. Even if we suffer defeat we shall achieve
      partial success. We shall get reforms. Reforms are an auxiliary
      instrument of the class struggle.


Further, Comrade Rykov says that there is no period of
      transition from capitalism to socialism. That is not so. It is a
      break with Marxism.


The line we have marked out is correct, and in future we shall
      make every effort to achieve an organisation in which there will
      be no Petrograd Committee-men to disobey the Central
      Committee. We are growing, and that is as it should be with a
      real party.

## Call An

      Speech on the Proposal to Call an International

      Socialist Conference

      April 25
(May 8)[1]


I cannot agree with Comrade Nogin. We have here what I believe
      to be a fact of paramount political importance, and we are in
      duty bound to launch a vigorous campaign against the Russian and
      Anglo-French chauvinists who have turned down Borgbjerg’s
      invitation to attend the conference. We must not forget the real
      issue, the motives underlying this whole affair. I am going to
      read to you Borgbjerg’s proposal exactly as reported by
      Rabochaya Gazeta. I shall show you that behind this
      comedy of a so-called socialist congress we shall find the very
      real political manoeuvres of German imperialism. The German
      capitalists, through the medium of the German
      social-chauvinists,
      are inviting the social-chauvinists of all countries to the
      conference. That is why we must launch a big campaign.


Why do they do it through the socialists? Because they want to
      fool the working masses. These diplomats are subtle men; to say
      this thing openly would not do, so they send a Danish Plekhanov
      to do it for them. We have seen German social-chauvinists abroad
      hundreds of times; they must be exposed.


      (Reads an excerpt from “Rabochaya Gazeta”
      No. 39,
      for May 8 (April 25), 1917.)
    


      “On behalf of the joint committee of the three Scandinavian
      labour parties (the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), Borgbjerg,
      editor of Social-Demokraten, the Central Organ of the
      Danish Social-Democratic Party, has passed on to the Executive
      Committee of the Soviet of

    

Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies a
      message inviting all the socialist parties in Russia to attend
      an international socialist conference. Owing to Denmark’s
      proximity to Germany, Borgbjerg was able to communicate with the
      German Social-Democrats, mainly with the ’majority’ faction, and
      the committee learned from him the peace terms which the
      official Social-Democratic Party of Germany would consider
      acceptable, and which its representatives would propose to the
      conference.
    

    “These terms are:


      “First of all they subscribe to the principles laid down by the
      Scandinavian and Dutch socialists at the 1915 conference,
      namely, the self-determination of nations, an obligatory
      international court of arbitration, and the demand for gradual
      disarmament. To this they add that the German Social-Democrats
      will urge that:


    “1. All territories seized by Germany and her allies be restored;


      “2. Russian Poland be granted full freedom to declare its
      independence or to remain a part of Russia;


    “3. Belgium be restored as a fully independent state;


      “4. Similarly, Serbia, Montenegro and Rumania be restored to the
      status of independent states;


      “5. Bulgaria be given the Bulgarian districts of Macedonia, and
      Serbia be given access to the Adriatic.


      “As regards Alsace-Lorraine, a peaceful agreement could be
      envisaged to rectify Lorraine’s frontiers; as far as the Poles
      of Poznan are concerned, the Germans will insist on their
      obtaining autonomy of national culture.”
    


There is not a shadow of doubt that this proposal comes from the
      German Government, who does not act directly, but resorts to the
      services of the Danish Plekhanovs, since German agents are
      obviously no good for this purpose. That is what
      social-chauvinists are for—to carry out such
      commissions. Our job is, on behalf of the seventy thousand
      workers of the proletarian party represented at this conference,
      to show them up to the whole world and reveal the motives they
      are trying to conceal. We must publish a detailed resolution,
      have it translated into foreign languages, and thus give these
      gentlemen the rebuff they deserve for daring to approach a
      socialist party. (Reads the draft resolution.)


The socialist papers this morning are silent. They know what
      they are about. They know that silence is golden. Only
      Rabochaya Gazeta publishes an article, which manages to
      say nothing in many words.


The Russian Government, more than anyone else, May rest assured
      that we are dealing here with an agent of the German
      Government. 
 

What with all this shouting about the liberation of
      Alsace-Lorraine, we should remind those gentlemen that the whole
      question is simply one of lucre, since there is immense wealth
      in Alsace-Lorraine, and the German capitalists are fighting the
      French capitalists for the division of the booty. It is good for
      them to have the Plekhanovs say that the liberation of
      Alsace-Lorraine is a sacred cause. When the German
      social-chauvinists therefore talk about a peaceful rectification
      of the frontiers of Alsace-Lorraine, they mean a peaceful
      division of the spoil between the French and the German
      imperialists.


One thing more I must add. I forgot to mention that the German
      representatives of the “Centre”—Kautsky, Haase, and
      Ledebour—have agreed to this conference. This is a most
      shameful thing. The British and French socialists have refused
      to attend the conference. This shows that the Anglo-French
      chauvinists, who call themselves socialists, are really agents
      of the bourgeoisie, because they are instrumental in continuing
      the imperialist war despite the tremendous efforts made by the
      German socialist majority through Borgbjerg; for, without a
      doubt, the German Government is saying through Borgbjerg: the
      situation is such that I am forced to return your booty to you
      (the German colonies in Africa). This is confirmed by the fact
      that the situation in Germany is desperate; the country is on
      the brink of ruin; to carry on the war now is a hopeless
      task. That is why they say they are ready to give up almost all
      the booty, for they still hope to be able to carve something out
      for themselves. The diplomats communicate freely with each
      other, and the bourgeois papers, when writing of foreign
      affairs, fool the people with phrase-mongering.


There is no doubt that when the British and French
      social-chauvinists said they were not going to the conference,
      they already knew all about it. They must have gone to their
      Foreign Offices where they were told: Such and such is the state
      of affairs, we don’t want you to go there. That, I am sure, is
      how matters stood.


If the Russian soldiers receive this resolution—and that, I
      think, should be done in the name of the seventy thousand
      members of our Party—they will really begin to see through
      the whole shady affair which has been concealed from

    

them. They
      will see then that Germany is unable to carry on her war of
      conquest, and that the Allies only aim at utterly crushing and
      robbing Germany. It cannot be denied that Borgbjerg is an agent
      of the German Government.


This, comrades, is the reason why I think we must expose this
      socialist congress comedy. All these congresses are nothing but
      comedies designed to cover up the deals made by the diplomats
      behind the backs of the masses. Once and for all we must tell
      the truth for all the soldiers at the front and all the workers
      of the world to hear. Our campaign with regard to such proposals
      will serve, on the one hand, to explain our proletarian policy,
      and, on the other, it will be mass action on a scale never heard
      of before. I ask you, therefore, to adopt this declaration,
      forward it to the Executive Committee, translate it into foreign
      languages, and publish it in tomorrow’s Pravda.

Notes
 
 



[1]



The question of calling
      an international conference of socialists of the belligerent and
      neutral countries was repeatedly discussed in the Executive
      Committee of the Petrograd Soviet in April 1917, the Executive
      Committee offering to take upon itself the initiative in
      convening such a conference. During the latter half of April the
      Danish Social-Democrat Borgbjerg, who was associated with the
      German social-chauvinists, arrived in Petrograd, and, on behalf
      of the joint committee of the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish
      labour parties (the



social-patriot majorities of these
      parties), invited the socialist parties of Russia to attend a
      conference on the question of concluding peace, due to be held
      in Stockholm in May 1917.


On April 23 (May 6) Borgbjerg made a report to the Executive
      Committee of the Petrograd Soviet in which he frankly declared
      that the German Government would “agree” to the peace terms
      which the German
      Social-Democrats would propose at the conference. On April
      25 (May 8) the Executive Committee heard the declarations of the
      Party groups on this question. The Bolsheviks announced the
      “Resolution on Borgbjerg’s Proposal” adopted that day by
      the April Conference. They were supported by the representatives
      of the Polish and Leftish Social-Democrats.



Lenin considered participation in this conference a complete betrayal of
internationalism.


The April Conference
was emphatically opposed to
      participation, and denounced Borgbjerg as an agent of
German
      imperialism. The Trudoviks,
      Bundists
      and Mensheviks
      were in favour of attending the conference. A Menshevik
      resolution was adopted in which the Executive Committee
      announced that it took upon itself the initiative in calling the
      conference and was setting up a special committee for that
      purpose.  The plenary meeting of the Soviet endorsed this
      decision.


The majority of the British, French and Belgian socialists
      refused to take part in the conference, since the British and
      French governments were out for complete victory over
      Germany. The Centrists
      agreed to attend: they were the Longuet
      group in France and the Independent Social-Democratic Party
      of Germany headed by Kautsky,
      Haase and Ledebour.


The Spartacus
      group affiliated to the Independents refused to
      attend the conference with the social-imperialists.
A declaration to this effect in his own
      name and on behalf of Karl
      Liebknecht and Rosa
      Luxemburg, who were in prison, was made by Franz
      Mehring.


The Stockholm conference did not take place, since some of the
      delegates did not receive passports from their governments, and
      others refused to sit with the representatives of the enemy
      countries.

      Resolution On Borgbjerg’s Proposal




In connection with the arrival of the Danish “socialist”
      Borgbjerg and his invitation to attend a congress of socialists
      in support of peace, which the German socialists of the
      Scheidemann and Plekhanov orientation propose on the basis of
      Germany renouncing most of her annexed territories, the
      Conference resolves:


Borgbjerg speaks on behalf of three Scandinavian
      parties—the Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian. He received his
      mandate from the Swedish party headed by Branting, a socialist
      who has gone over to the side of “his own” bourgeoisie and
      betrayed the revolutionary union of the world’s workers. We
      cannot recognise this Swedish party as a socialist party. The
      only socialist party in Sweden we recognise is the youth party
      headed by Hoglund, Lindhagen, Strom, Carleson, and others.


Neither do we consider the Danish party, from which Borgbjerg
      has his mandate, a socialist party, because it is headed by
      Stauning, a member of the bourgeois cabinet. Stauning’s joining
      the bourgeois cabinet evoked a protest on the part of a group
      headed by Comrade Trier, which left the party, declaring that
      the Danish Socialist Party had become a bourgeois party.


Borgbjerg, on his own admission, is acting in accord with
      Scheidemann and other German socialists who have defected to the
      German Government and the German bourgeoisie.


There can be no doubt, therefore, that Borgbjerg, directly or
      indirectly, is really an agent of the German imperialist
      government.


In view of this, the Conference considers the idea of our
      Party’s attendance at a conference which includes Borgbjerg and
      Scheidemann to be unacceptable in principle, since

    

our task is
      to unite, not direct or indirect agents of the various
      imperialist governments, but the workers of all countries, who,
      already during the war, have begun a revolutionary fight against
      their own imperialist governments.


Only a meeting and closer contact with these parties and groups
      are capable of effectively promoting the cause of peace.


We warn the workers against placing their trust in the
      conference which is being organised by Borgbjerg, because this
      conference of pseudo-socialists will merely be a comedy to cover
      up the deals the diplomats are clinching behind its back, deals
      which involve an interchange of annexations by which Armenia,
      for example, will be “given” to the Russian capitalists, and
      Britain will be “given” the colonies she has robbed Germany of,
      while probably “ceding” to the German capitalists by way of
      compensation part of the Lorraine ore-bearing territories
      containing immense wealth in excellent iron ores, etc.


The socialists cannot, without betraying the proletarian cause,
      take part directly or indirectly in this dirty huckstering and
      haggling among the capitalists of various countries over the
      division of the loot.



at the same time the Conference considers that the German
      capitalists have not, even through the mouth of Borgbjerg,
      renounced all their annexations, not to mention the immediate
      withdrawal of their troops from the territories which they have
      seized. Germany’s Danish regions, her Polish territories, and
      her French part of Alsace are as much annexations of the German
      capitalists as Kurland,
      Finland, Poland, Ukraine, etc., are of the Russian tsars and the
      Russian capitalists.


As to restoring Poland’s independence, this is deception on the
      part of the German and Austrian capitalists as well as the
      Russian Provisional Government, which speaks of a so-called
      “free” military alliance between Poland and Russia. To ascertain
      the real will of the people in all the annexed territories it is
      necessary that all troops should be withdrawn and the opinion of
      the population be given free expression. Only such a measure
      applied to the whole of Poland (that is, not only to the part
      the Russians have seized, but also the part the Germans and
      Austrians have seized) and to the

    

whole of Armenia, etc., would
      be a step towards translating the governments’ promises into
      deeds.


The Conference, further, takes note of the fact that the British
      and French socialists, who have gone over to the side of their
      capitalist governments, have refused to attend the conference
      sponsored by Borgbjerg. This fact clearly demonstrates that the
      Anglo-French imperialist bourgeoisie, whose agents these
      pseudo-socialists are, wish to continue, wish to drag out this
      imperialist war without even desiring to discuss the concessions
      which the German imperialist bourgeoisie, under pressure of
      growing exhaustion, hunger, economic ruin, and—most
      important of all—the impending workers’ revolution in
      Germany, are compelled to promise through the medium of
      Borgbjerg.


The Conference resolves to give all these facts the widest
      possible publicity, and, in particular, to bring them to the
      notice of the Russian soldiers at the front in the fullest
      possible detail. The Russian soldiers must learn that the
      Anglo-French capitalists, followed by the Russian, are dragging
      out the war, ruling out even such a conference to discuss peace
      terms.


The Russian soldiers must learn that the watchword “War to a
      victorious finish” now serves as a screen for Britain’s bid to
      strengthen her domination in Baghdad and in Germany’s African
      colonies, for the striving of the Russian capitalists to plunder
      and subdue Armenia and Persia, etc., for the striving to bring
      about Germany’s complete defeat.


The Russian soldiers at the front must arrange voting in every
      military unit, in every regiment, in every company, on the
      question whether they want the war to be dragged out like this
      by the capitalists, or whether they want it to be speedily
      terminated by having all power in the state pass wholly and
      exclusively into the hands of the Soviets of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies.


The party of the proletariat in Russia will attend a conference
      and enter into a fraternal union with only such workers’ parties
      of other countries as are waging a revolutionary struggle in
      their own countries for all state power passing to the
      proletariat.

      April 25 (May 8)
    

      BRIEF PRESS REPORT
    

Comrade Lenin pointed out that the French revolution passed
      through a phase of municipal revolution, that it drew its
      strength from the local organs of self-government, which became
      its mainstay. In the Russian revolution we observe a certain
      bureaucratism in the centres, and a greater exercise of power
      wielded by the Soviets
      locally, in the provinces. In the capital cities the Soviets are
      politically more dependent upon the bourgeois central
      authorities than those in the provinces. In the centres it is
      not so easy to take control of production; in the provinces this
      has already been carried out to some extent. The inference
      is—to strengthen the local Soviets. Progress in this
      respect is possible, coming primarily from the provinces.

      Draft Theses to the Resolution on the Soviets
    

In a number of local, especially working-class, centres the role
      of the Soviets
      has proved to be a particularly important one. They hold
      undivided power. The bourgeoisie has been disarmed and reduced
      to complete submission; wages have been raised, and the hours of
      work reduced without lowering production; food supplies are
      ensured; control over production and distribution has been
      initiated; all the old authorities have been displaced; the
      revolutionary initiative of the peasants is encouraged both on
      the question of power (the dismissal of the old and setting up
      of new authorities) and on the question of the land.


In the capital and certain large centres a reverse tendency is
      to be observed. The Soviets are less proletarian in their
      make-up, the influence of the petty-bourgeois elements in the
      executive committees is incomparably wider, and there
      is—especially in the commissions—“co-operation with
      the bourgeoisie”, who curbs the revolutionary initiative of the
      masses, bureaucratises the revolutionary movement of
      the masses and their revolutionary aims, and blocks all
      revolutionary measures that are liable to affect the
      capitalists.


It is quite natural and inevitable that after the fullest
      development of revolutionary energy in the capital, where the
      people and especially the workers had borne the greatest
      sacrifices in overthrowing tsarism—in the capital, where
      the central state power had been overthrown and the most
      centralised power of capital had given maximum power to the
      capitalists—the power of the Soviets (and the power of the
      proletariat) proved to be weak, the problem of developing the
      revolution very difficult, the transition to a new stage of the
      revolution extremely hard, and the resistance of the bourgeoisie
      stronger than anywhere else.

 

Hence: so long as the main effort in the capital cities and the
      large centres still has to be directed towards building
      up forces for completing the second stage of the
      revolution, in the local areas the revolution can and should be
      advanced by direct action, by the exercise of undivided
      power by the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, by developing the
      revolutionary energy of the worker and peasant mass, by
      establishing control over the production and distribution of
      products, and so on.


The following trend of the revolution can be traced:
    

      (1) removal of the old government in the centre;
      (2) seizure
      of power by the bourgeoisie in view of the proletariat’s
      unpreparedness for tackling colossal tasks of
      nation-wide importance;
      (3) development of the
      revolution locally;
      (4) in local areas and particularly
      in the proletarian centres—communes and development of
      revolutionary energy of the masses;
      (5) the
      land—seizure of it, etc.;
      (6) factories; control
      over them;
      (7) undivided power;
      (8) local, municipal
      revolution going forward;
      (9) bureaucratisation,
      submission to the bourgeoisie in the centre.


Conclusions:
(α) 1: build-up in the
      centre (build-up of forces for a new revolution);
      (β)

2: advance the
      revolution (power? land? factories?) in the local areas;
      (γ) 3: communes locally, i.e.
      (α α) complete local autonomy;
      self-established;

      (β β) without police, without government
      officials, full power by armed worker and peasant masses;
      (δ) 4: combat bureaucratising and
      bourgeois-placating influence of the petty-bourgeois elements;
      (ε) 5: gather local experience for
      prodding the centre: local areas become a
      model.
    

      (σ) 6: bring home to the mass of
      workers, peasants, and soldiers that the reason for the
      revolution’s success locally is undivided power and the
      dictatorship of the proletariat.
    

      (η) 7: in the centre, of course, it is
      more difficult, takes more time.
    

      + (ι) 8: development of the revolution by
      way of communes formed out of suburbs and blocks in the
      large cities....
    

      (χ) 9: transformation (in the capital
      cities, etc.) into “servants of the bourgeoisie”.

## In Favour of the
    Resolution on the
    War









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Speech in Favour of the Resolution on the War April 27 (May 10)







V. I.  

      Lenin

      Speech in Favour of the Resolution on the War

      April 27 (May 10)
    

Comrades, the original draft resolution on the war was read by
      me at the City Conference. Because of the crisis that absorbed
      the attention and energy of all our comrades in Petrograd, we
      were unable to amend the draft. Since yesterday, however, the
      committee working on it has made satisfactory progress: the
      draft has been changed, considerably shortened and, in our
      opinion, improved.


I wish to say a few words about the construction of this
      resolution. It consists of three parts. The first is devoted to
      a class analysis of the war; it also contains our statement of
      principles explaining why our Party warns against placing any
      trust in promises made by the Provisional Government, as well as
      against any support for that government. The second part of the
      resolution deals with the question of revolutionary defencism as
      an extremely broad mass movement which has now united against us
      the overwhelming majority of the nation. Our task is to define
      the class significance of this revolutionary defencism, its
      essence, and the real balance of forces, and find a way to fight
      this trend. The third part of the resolution deals with the
      question of how to end the war. This practical question, which
      is of supreme importance to our Party, required a detailed
      answer. We think that we have succeeded in meeting this
      requirement satistactorily. The articles in Pravda and
      numerous articles on the war published in provincial newspapers
      (the latter reach us very irregularly) because the postal
      service is disorganised, and we have to take every convenient
      opportunity of getting them for the Central Committee) reveal a
      negative attitude

    

towards the war and the loan. I think that the
      vote against the loan settled the question as to our opposition
      to revolutionary defencism. I do not think it is possible to go
      into greater detail on this.


      “The present war is, on the part of both groups of the
      belligerent powers, an imperialist war, i. e., one waged by the
      capitalists for the division of the profits obtained from world
      domination; for markets for finance (banking) capital, for the
      subjugation of the weaker nationalities, etc.”


The primary and basic issue is the meaning of the war, a
      question of a general and political character, a moot question
      which the capitalists and the social-chauvinists carefully
      evade. This is why we must put this question first, with this
      addition to it:


      “Each day of war enriches the financial and industrial
      bourgeoisie and impoverishes and saps the strength of the
      proletariat and the peasantry of all the belligerents, as well
      as of the neutral countries. In Russia, moreover, prolongation
      of the war involves a grave danger to the revolution’s gains and
      its further development.


      “The passing of state power in Russia to the Provisional
      Government, a government of the landowners and capitalists, did
      not and could not alter the character and meaning of the war as
      far as Russia is concerned.”


The words I have just read to you are of great importance in all
      our propaganda and agitation. Has the class character of the war
      changed now? Can it change? Our reply is based on the fact that
      power has passed to the landowners and capitalists, the same
      government that had engineered this war. We then pass on to one
      of the facts that reveal most clearly the character of the
      war. Class character as expressed by the entire policy carried
      on for decades by definite classes is one thing, the obvious
      class character of the war is another.


      “This fact was most strikingly demonstrated when the new
      government not only failed to publish the secret treaties
      between Tsar Nicholas II and the capitalist governments of
      Britain, France, etc., but even formally and without consulting
      the nation confirmed these secret treaties, which promise the
      Russian capitalists a free hand to rob China, Persia, Turkey,
      Austria, etc. By concealing these treaties

    

from the people of
      Russia the latter are being deceived as to the true character of
      the war.”


And so, I emphasise again, we are pointing out one particularly
      striking confirmation of the character of the war. Even if there
      were no treaties at all, the character of the war would be the
      same because groups of capitalists can very often come to an
      agreement without any treaties. But the treaties exist and their
      implications are apparent. For the purpose of co-ordinating the
      work of our agitators and propagandists, we think this fact
      should be especially emphasised, and so we have made a special
      point of it. The people’s attention is and should be called to
      this fact, all the more so as the treaties were concluded by the
      tsar, who has been overthrown. The people ought to be made aware
      that the present governments are carrying on the war on the
      basis of treaties concluded between the old governments. This, I
      feel, makes the contradictions between the capitalist interests
      and the will of the people stand out most strikingly, and it is
      for the propagandists to expose these contradictions, to draw
      the people’s attention to them, to strive to explain them to the
      masses by appealing to their class-consciousness. The contents
      of these treaties leave no room for doubt that they promise
      enormous profits to the capitalists to be derived from robbing
      other countries. That is why they are always kept secret. There
      is not a republic in the world whose foreign policy is conducted
      in the open. It is fatuous, while the capitalist system exists,
      to expect the capitalists to open up their ledgers. While there
      is private ownership of the means of production, there is bound
      to be private ownership of shares and financial operations. The
      corner-stone of contemporary diplomacy is financial operations,
      which amount to robbing and strangling the weak
      nationalities. These, we believe, are the fundamental premises
      upon which the evaluation of the war rests.

    
Proceeding from these premises we conclude that:

    

      “For this reason, no proletarian party that does not wish to
      break completely. with internationalism, i. e., with the
      fraternal solidarity of the workers of all countries in their
      struggle against the yoke of capital, can support the present
      war, or the present government, or its loans.”


This is our chief and basic conclusion. It determines

    

our whole
      tactics and sets us apart from all the other parties, no matter
      how socialistic they claim to be. This proposition, which is
      irrefutable to all of us, predetermines our attitude towards all
      the other political parties.


The next point concerns the wide use which our government is
      making of promises. These promises are the object of a prolonged
      campaign by the Soviets, which have become muddled by these
      promises, and which are trying the people’s patience. We,
      therefore, consider it necessary to add to our purely objective
      analysis of the class relations an analysis of those promises,
      promises which in themselves have, of course, no significance to
      a Marxist, but which mean a great deal to the people, and mean
      even more in politics. The Petrograd Soviet has become muddled
      by these promises, has given weight to them by promising its
      support. This is the reason why we add the following statement
      to this point:


      “No trust can be placed in the present government’s promises to
      renounce annexations, i. e., conquests of foreign countries or
      retention by force of any nationality within the confines of
      Russia.”


      “Annexation” being a foreign word, we give it an exact political
      definition, such as neither the Cadets nor the petty-bourgeois
      democratic parties (the Narodniks and Mensheviks) can give. Few
      words have been used so meaninglessly and slovenly.


      “For, in the first place, the capitalists, bound together by the
      thousand threads of banking capital, cannot renounce annexations
      in this war without renouncing the profits from the thousands of
      millions invested in loans, concessions, war industries,
      etc. And secondly, the new government, after renouncing
      annexations to mislead the people, declared through Milyukov
      (Moscow, April 9, 1917) that it had no intention of renouncing
      them, and, in the Note of April 18 and its elucidation of April
      22, confirmed the expansionist character of its policy.

“Therefore, in warning the people against the
      capitalists’ empty promises, the Conference declares that it is
      necessary to make a clear distinction between a renunciation of
      annexations in word and a renunciation of annexations in deed,
      i. e., the immediate publication and abrogation of all the
      secret, predatory treaties and the immediate granting to

    

all
      nationalities of the right to determine by free voting whether
      they wish to be independent states or to be part of another
      state.”


We have found it necessary to mention this, because the question
      of peace without annexations is the basic issue in all these
      discussions of peace terms. All parties recognise that peace
      will become the alternative, and that peace with annexations
      will be an unheard-of catastrophe for all countries. In a
      country where there is political liberty, the question of peace
      cannot be placed before the people otherwise than in terms of
      peace without annexations. It is therefore necessary to declare
      for peace without annexations, and so the only thing to do is to
      lie by wrapping up the meaning of annexations or evading the
      question altogether. Rech, for instance, cries that the
      return of Kurland means renunciation of annexations. When I was
      addressing the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, a
      soldier handed me a slip of paper with the following question:
      “We have to fight to win back Kurland. Does winning back Kurland
      mean that you stand for annexations?” I had to reply in the
      affirmative. We are against Germany annexing Kurland, but we are
      also against Russia holding Kurland by force. For example, our
      government has issued a manifesto proclaiming the independence
      of Poland. This manifesto, chock-full of meaningless phrases,
      states that Poland must form a free military alliance with
      Russia. These three words contain the whole truth. A free
      military alliance of little Poland with huge Russia is, in point
      of fact, complete military subjection of Poland. Poland May be
      granted political freedom but her boundaries will be determined
      by the military alliance.


If we fight for the Russian capitalists keeping possession of
      the former annexed territories of Kurland and Poland, then the
      German capitalists have the right to rob Kurland. They May argue
      this way: we looted Poland together. at the end of the
      eighteenth century, when we began to tear Poland to pieces,
      Prussia was a very small and weak country while Russia was a
      giant, and therefore she grabbed more. Now we have grown and it
      is our intention, if you please, to snatch a larger share. You
      can say nothing against this capitalist logic. In 1863 Japan was
      a mere nothing in comparison with Russia,

    

but in 1905 Japan
      thrashed Russia. From 1863 to 1873 Germany was a mere nothing in
      comparison with Britain, but now Germany is stronger than
      Britain. The Germans May argue: we were weak when Kurland was
      taken from us, but we have now grown stronger than you, and we
      wish to take it back. Not to renounce annexations means to
      justify endless wars over the conquest of weaker
      nationalities. To renounce annexations means to let each nation
      determine freely whether it wants to live separately or together
      with others. Of course, for this purpose, armies must be with
      drawn. To show the slightest hesitation on the question of
      annexations means to justify endless wars. It follows that we
      could allow no hesitation on this question. With regard to
      annexations, our answer is that nations must be free to make
      their own decisions. How can we secure economic freedom
      alongside this political freedom? To accomplish this, power must
      pass into the hands of the proletariat and the yoke of capital
      must be overthrown.


I now pass on to the second part of the resolution.


      “The ’revolutionary
      defencism”, which in Russia has now permeated all the Narodnik
      parties (the Popular Socialists, Trudoviks, and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries), the opportunist party of the
      Menshevik Social-Democrats (the Organising Committee, Chkheidze,
      Tsereteli, etc.), and the majority of the non-party
      revolutionaries, reflects, in point of class significance, the
      interests and point of view of the well-to-do peasants and a
      part of the small proprietors, who, like the capitalists, profit
      by oppressing weak peoples. on the other hand, revolutionary
      defencism is a result of the deception by the capitalists of a
      part of the urban and rural proletariat and semi-proletariat,
      who, by their class position, have no interest in the profits of
      the capitalists and in the imperialist war.”

Consequently, our task here is to determine from what sections of
      society this defencist tendency could emerge. Russia is the most
      petty-bourgeois country in the world, and the upper sections of
      the petty bourgeoisie are directly interested in continuing the
      war. The well-to-do peasants, like the capitalists, are
      profiting by the war. on the other hand, the mass of
      proletarians and semi-proletarians have no interest in
      annexations because they make no profit on

    

banking capital. How,
      then, have these classes come to adopt the position of
      revolutionary defencism? Their attitude towards revolutionary
      defencism is due to the influence of capitalist ideology, which
      the resolution designates by the word “deception”. They are
      unable to differentiate between the interests of the capitalists
      and the interests of the country. Hence we conclude:


      “The Conference recognises that any concessions to revolutionary
      defencism are absolutely impermissible and virtually signify a
      complete break with internationalism and socialism. As for the
      defencist tendencies among the broad masses, our Party will
      fight against these tendencies by ceaselessly explaining the
      truth that the attitude of unreasoning trust in the government
      of the capitalists, at the moment, is one of the chief obstacles
      to a speedy termination of the war.”


The last words express the specific feature that sharply
      distinguishes Russia from the other Western capitalist countries
      and from all capitalist democratic republics. For it cannot be
      said of those countries that the trustfulness of the
      unenlightened masses there is the chief cause of the
      prolongation of the war. The masses there are now in the iron
      grip of military discipline. The more democratic the republic,
      the stronger discipline is, since law in a republic rests on
      “the will of the people”. Owing to the revolution there is no
      such discipline in Russia. The masses freely elect
      representatives to the Soviets, which is something that does not
      exist now anywhere else in the world. But the masses have
      unreasoning trust, and are therefore used for the purposes of
      the struggle. So far we can do nothing but explain. Our
      explanations must deal with the immediate revolutionary tasks
      and methods of action. When the masses are free, any attempts to
      act in the name of a minority, without explaining things to the
      masses, would be senseless Blanquism, mere adventurism. Only by
      winning over the masses, if they can be won, can we lay a solid
      foundation for the victory of the proletarian class struggle.


I now pass on to the third part of the resolution:


      “In regard to the most important question of all, namely, how to
      end the present capitalist war as soon as possible, not by a
      coercive peace, but by a truly democratic peace, the Conference
      recognises and declares the following:

 

      “This war cannot be ended by a refusal of the soldiers of one
      side only to continue the war, by a simple cessation of
      hostilities by one of the belligerents.”


The idea of terminating the war in this way has been attributed
      to us over and over again by persons who wish to win an easy
      victory over their opponents by distorting the latter’s
      views—a typical method used by the capitalists, who ascribe
      to us the absurd idea of wishing to end the war by a one-sided
      refusal to fight. They say “the war cannot be ended by sticking
      your bayonet in the ground”, to quote a soldier, a typical
      revolutionary defencist. This is no argument, I say. The idea
      that the war can be terminated without changing the classes in
      power is an anarchist idea. Either this idea is anarchistic, in
      which case it has no meaning, no state significance, or it is a
      hazy pacifist idea that fails completely to appreciate the
      connection between politics and the oppressing class. War is an
      evil, peace is a blessing....Certainly this idea must be made
      clear to the people, must be popularised. Incidentally, all our
      resolutions are being written for leading Party members, for
      Marxists, and do not make reading matter for the masses. But
      they must serve as unifying and guiding political principles for
      every propagandist and agitator. To meet this requirement, one
      more paragraph was added to the resolution:


      “The Conference reiterates its protest against the base slander
      spread by the capitalists against our Party to the effect that
      we are in favour of a separate peace with Germany. We consider
      the German capitalists to be as predatory as the Russian,
      British, French, and other capitalists, and Emperor Wilhelm as
      bad a crowned brigand as Nicholas II or the British, Italian,
      Rumanian, and all other monarchs.”


On this point there was some disagreement in the committee, some
      maintaining that in this passage our language became too
      popular, others, that the British, Italian. and Rumanian
      monarchs did not deserve the honour of being mentioned. After a
      detailed discussion, however, we all agreed that, since our
      present aim is to refute all the slanders which
      Birzhevka[1]

has tried to spread against us rather
      crudely,

    

Rech more subtly, Yedinstvo by direct
      implication, we must, on a question of this nature, come out
      with a most sharp and trenchant criticism of these ideas, having
      in mind the broadest masses of the people. Asked why we do not
      help to over throw Wilhelm if we consider him a brigand, we can
      say that the others, too, are brigands, that we ought to fight
      against them as well, that one must not forget the kings of
      Italy and Rumania, that brigands can also be found among our
      Allies. These two paragraphs are intended to combat the slander,
      which is meant to lead to riot-mongering and squabbling. This is
      the reason why we must now pass on to the serious practical
      question of how to terminate the war.


      “Our Party will patiently but persistently explain to the people
      the truth that wars are waged by governments, that wars are
      always indissolubly bound up with the policies of definite
      classes, that this war can be terminated by a democratic peace
      only if the entire state power, in at least several of the
      belligerent countries, has passed to the class of the
      proletarians and semi-proletarians which is really capable of
      putting an end to the oppressive rule of capital.”


To a Marxist these truths—that wars are waged by the
      capitalists and are bound up with the capitalists’ class
      interests—are absolute truths. A Marxist need not dwell on
      that. But as far as the masses are concerned, skilful agitators
      and propagandists should be able to explain this truth simply,
      without using foreign words, for with us discussions usually
      degenerate into empty and futile squabbling. The explaining of
      this truth is what we have been trying to do in every part of
      the resolution. We say that in order to understand what the war
      is about, you must ask who gains by it; in order to understand
      how to put an end to the war, you must ask which classes do not
      gain by it. The connection here is clear, hence we conclude:


      “In Russia, the revolutionary class, having taken state power,
      would adopt a series of measures that would lead to the
      destruction of the economic rule of the capitalists, as well as
      measures that would render them completely harmless politically,
      and would immediately and frankly offer to all nations a
      democratic peace on the basis of a complete renunciation of
      every possible form of annexation.”

 

Once we speak in the name of the revolutionary class, the people
      have the right to ask: and what about you, what would you do in
      their place to end the war? This is an inevitable question. The
      people are electing us now as their representatives, and we must
      give a very precise answer. The revolutionary class, having
      taken power, would set out to undermine the rule of the
      capitalists, and would then offer to all nations well-defined
      peace terms, because, unless the economic rule of the
      capitalists is undermined, all we can have are scraps of
      paper. Only a victorious class can accomplish this, can bring
      about a change in policy.


I repeat: to bring this truth home to the uneducated mass, we
      need intermediate links that would help to introduce this
      question to them. The mistake and falsehood of popular
      literature on the war is the evasion of this question; it
      ignores this question and presents the matter as if there had
      been no class struggle, as if two countries had lived amicably
      until one attacked the other, and the attacked has been
      defending itself. This is vulgar reasoning in which there is not
      a shadow of objective truth, and which is a deliberate deception
      of the people by educated persons. If we approach this question
      properly, anyone would be able to grasp the essential point; for
      the interests of the ruling classes are one thing, and the
      interests of the oppressed classes are another.


What would happen if the revolutionary class took power?


      “Such measures and such a frank offer of peace would bring about
      complete confidence of the workers of the belligerent countries
      in each other....”


Such confidence is impossible now, and the words of manifestos
      will not create it. Where the philosopher once said that speech
      has been given to man to enable him to conceal his thoughts, the
      diplomats always say: “Conferences are held to deceive the
      people.” Not only the capitalists, but the socialists too reason
      this way. This particularly applies to the conference which
      Borgbjerg is calling.


      “...and would inevitably lead to uprisings of the proletariat
      against those imperialist governments as might resist the
      offered peace.”


Nobody now believes the capitalist government when it says: “We
      are for peace without annexations.” The masses have the instinct
      of oppressed classes which tells them that

    

nothing has
      changed. Only if the policy were actually changed in one
      country, confidence would appear and attempts at uprisings would
      be made. We speak of “uprisings” because we are now discussing
      all countries. To say “a revolution has taken place in one
      country, so now it must take place in Germany”—is false
      reasoning. There is a tendency to form an order of sequence, but
      this cannot be done. We all went through the revolution of
      1905. We all heard or witnessed how that revolution gave birth
      to revolutionary ideas throughout the world, a fact which Marx
      constantly referred to. Revolutions cannot be made, they cannot
      be taken in turns. A revolution cannot be made to order—it
      develops. This form of charlatanism is now frequently being
      practised in Russia. The people are told: You in Russia have
      made a revolution, now it is the Germans’ turn. If the objective
      conditions change, then an uprising is inevitable, but we do not
      know whose turn it will be, when it will take place, and with
      what degree of success. We are asked: If the revolutionary class
      takes power in Russia, and if no uprisings break out in other
      countries, what will the revolutionary party do? What will
      happen then? This question is answered in the last paragraph of
      our resolution.


      “Until the revolutionary class in Russia takes the entire state
      power, our Party will do all it can to support those proletarian
      parties and groups abroad that are in fact, already during the
      war, conducting a revolutionary struggle against their
      imperialist governments and their bourgeoisie.”


This is all that we can promise and must do now. The revolution
      is mounting in every country, but no one knows to what extent it
      is mounting and when it will break out. In every country there
      are people who are carrying on a revolutionary struggle against
      their governments. They are the people, the only people, we must
      support. This is the real thing—all else is falsehood. And
      so we add:


      “Our Party will particularly support the mass fraternisation of
      the soldiers of all the belligerent countries that has already
      begun at the front....”


This is to meet Plekhanov’s argument: “What will come of it?
      Suppose you do fraternise, then what? Does this not suggest the
      possibility of a separate peace at the front?” This is
      jiggery-pokery, not a serious argument. We want

    

fraternisation
      on all fronts, and we are taking pains to encourage it. When we
      worked in Switzerland, we published an appeal in two languages,
      with French on one side and German on the other, urging those
      soldiers to do the same thing we are now urging the Russian
      soldiers to do. We do not confine ourselves to fraternisation
      between German and Russian soldiers, we call upon all to
      fraternise. This, then, is what we mean by fraternisation:


      “...endeavouring to turn this instinctive expression of
      solidarity of the oppressed into a politically-conscious
      movement as well organised as possible for the transfer of all
      state power in all the belligerent countries to the
      revolutionary proletariat.”


Fraternisation, so far, is instinctive, and we must not deceive
      ourselves on this score. We must admit this in order not to
      delude the people. The fraternising soldiers are actuated not by
      a clear-cut political idea but by the instinct of oppressed
      people, who are tired, exhausted and begin to lose confidence in
      capitalist promises. They say: “While you keep on talking about
      peace—we have been hearing it now for two and a half
      years—we shall start things moving ourselves.” This is a
      true class instinct. Without this instinct the cause of the
      revolution would be hopeless. As you know, nobody would free the
      workers if they did not free themselves. But is instinct alone
      sufficient? You would not get far if you rely on instinct
      alone. This instinct must be transformed into political
      awareness.


In our “Appeal to the Soldiers of All the
      Belligerent Countries” we explain into what this
      fraternisation should develop—into the passing of political
      power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies.[2]

Naturally, the German workers will call their Soviets
      by a different name, but this does not matter. The point is that
      we undoubtedly recognise as correct that fraternisation is
      instinctive, that we do not simply confine ourselves to
      encouraging fraternisation, but set ourselves the task of
      turning this instinctive fraternisation of workers and peasants
      in soldiers’ uniforms into a politically-conscious movement,
      whose aim is the transfer

    

of power in all the belligerent
      countries into the hands of the revolutionary proletariat. This
      is a very difficult task, but the position in which humanity
      finds itself under capitalist rule is tremendously difficult,
      too, and leads to destruction. This is why it will call forth
      that explosion of discontent which is the guarantee of
      proletarian revolution.


This is our resolution, which we submit for consideration to the Conference.

## Resolution on the War









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Resolution on the War







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917

      Resolution on the War
    
I
The present war is, on the part of both groups of the
      belligerent powers, an imperialist war, i. e., one waged by the
      capitalists for the division of the profits obtained from world
      domination, for markets for finance (banking) capital, for the
      subjugation of the weaker nationalities, etc. Each day of war
      enriches the financial and industrial bourgeoisie and impoverishes
      and saps the strength of the proletariat and the peasantry of all
      the belligerents, as well as of the neutral countries. In Russia,
      moreover, prolongation of the war involves a grave danger to the
      revolution’s gains and its further development.
    

The passing of state power in Russia to the Provisional
      Government, a government of the landowners and capitalists, did
      not and could not alter the character and meaning of the war as
      far as Russia is concerned.


This fact was most strikingly demonstrated when the new
      government not only failed to publish the secret treaties
      between Tsar Nicholas II and the capitalist governments of
      Britain, France, etc., but even formally and without consulting
      the nation confirmed these secret treaties, which promise the
      Russian capitalists a free hand to rob China, Persia, Turkey,
      Austria, etc. By concealing these treaties from the people of
      Russia the latter are being deceived as to the true character of
      the war.

For this reason, no proletarian party that does not wish to break
      completely with internationalism, i. e., with the

    

fraternal
      solidarity of the workers of all countries in their struggle
      against the yoke of capital, can support the present war, or the
      present government, or its loans.


No trust can be placed in the present government’s promises to
      renounce annexations, i. e., conquests of foreign countries or
      retention by force of any nationality within the confines of
      Russia. For, in the first place, the capitalists, bound together
      by the thousand threads of banking capital, cannot renounce
      annexations in this war without renouncing the profits from the
      thousands of millions invested in loans, concessions, war
      industries, etc. And secondly, the new government, after
      renouncing annexations to mislead the people, declared through
      Milyukov (Moscow, April 9, 1917) that it had no intention of
      renouncing them, and, in the Note of April 18 and its
      elucidation of April 22, confirmed the expansionist character of
      its policy. Therefore, in warning the people against the
      capitalists’ empty promises, the Conference declares that it is
      necessary to make a clear distinction between a renunciation of
      annexations in word and a renunciation of annexations in deed,
      i. e., the immediate publication and abrogation of all the
      secret, predatory treaties and the immediate granting to all
      nationalities of the right to determine by free voting whether
      they wish to be independent states or to be part of another
      state.
    
II

The “revolutionary defencism”, which in Russia has now permeated
      all the Narodnik parties (the Popular Socialists, Trudoviks, and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries), the opportunist party of the
      Menshevik Social-Democrats (the Organising Committee, Chkheidze,
      Tsereteli, etc.), and the majority of the non-party
      revolutionaries, reflects, in point of class significance, the
      interests and point of view of the well-to-do peasants and a
      part of the small proprietors, who, like the capitalists, profit
      by oppressing weak peoples. on the other hand, “revolutionary
      defencism” is a result of the deception by the capitalists of a
      part of the urban and rural proletariat and semi-proletariat,
      who, by their class position, have no interest in the profits of
      the capitalists and in the imperialist war.
    
 

The Conference recognises that any concessions to “revolutionary
      defencism” are absolutely impermissible and virtually signify a
      complete break with internationalism and socialism. As for the
      defencist tendencies among the broad masses, our Party will
      fight against these tendencies by ceaselessly explaining the
      truth that the attitude of unreasoning trust in the government
      of the capitalists, at the moment, is one of the chief obstacles
      to a speedy termination of the war.
    
III

In regard to the most important question of all, namely, how to
      end the present capitalist war as soon as possible, not by a
      coercive peace, but by a truly democratic peace, the Conference
      recognises and declares the following:


This war cannot be ended by a refusal of the soldiers of one
      side only to continue the war, by a simple cessation of
      hostilities by one of the belligerents.


The Conference reiterates its protest against the base slander
      spread by the capitalists against our Party to the effect that
      we are in favour of a separate peace with Germany. We consider
      the German capitalists to be as predatory as the Russian,
      British, French, and other capitalists, and Emperor Wilhelm as
      bad a crowned brigand as Nicholas II or the British, Italian,
      Rumanian, and all other monarchs.


Our Party will patiently but persistently explain to the people
      the truth that wars are waged by governments, that wars
      are always indissolubly bound up with the policies of definite
      classes, that this war can be terminated by a
      democratic peace only if the entire state power, in at
      least several of the belligerent countries, has passed to the
      class of the proletarians and semi-proletarians which is really
      capable of putting an end to the oppressive rule of capital.

In Russia, the revolutionary class, having taken state power,
      would adopt a series of measures that would undermine the
      economic rule of the capitalists, as well as measures that would
      render them completely harmless politically, and would
      immediately and frankly offer to all nations a democratic peace
      on the basis of a complete renunciation of every possible form
      of annexation and indemnity. Such

    

measures and such a frank
      offer of peace would bring about complete confidence of the
      workers of the belligerent countries in each other and would
      inevitably lead to uprisings of the proletariat against those
      imperialist governments as might resist the offered peace.


Until the revolutionary class in Russia takes the entire state
      power, our Party will do all it can to support those proletarian
      parties and groups abroad that are in fact, already during the
      war, conducting a revolutionary struggle against their
      imperialist governments and their bourgeoisie. Our Party will
      particularly support the mass fraternisation of the soldiers of
      all the belligerent countries that has already begun at the
      front, endeavouring to turn this instinctive expression of
      solidarity of the oppressed into a politically conscious
      movement as well organised as possible for the transfer of all
      state power in all the belligerent countries to the
      revolutionary proletariat.

## Attitude Towards the
    Provisional Government









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Resolution on the Attitude Towards the Provisional Government







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917



    

10

      Resolution on the Attitude Towards

      the Provisional Government
    
The All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. recognises that:
    

      1. The Provisional Government, by its class character, is the
      organ of landowner and bourgeois domination;


   2. The Provisional Government and the classes it represents are
      bound with indissoluble economic and political ties to Russian
      and Anglo-French imperialism;


   3. The Provisional Government is carrying out its proclaimed
      programme only partially, and only under pressure of the
      revolutionary proletariat and, to some extent, of the petty
      bourgeoisie;


      4. The forces of bourgeois and landowner counter-revolution, now
      being organised, have already, under cover of the Provisional
      Government and with the latter’s obvious connivance, launched an
      attack on revolutionary democracy: thus the Provisional
      Government is avoiding fixing the date for the elections to the
      Constituent Assembly, preventing the arming of the people as a
      whole, opposing the transfer of all the land to the people,
      foisting upon it the landowners’ way of settling the agrarian
      question, obstructing the introduction of an eight-hour workday,
      condoning counter-revolutionary propaganda in the army (by
      Guchkov and Co.), rallying the high-ranking officers against the
      soldiers, etc.;

5. The Provisional Government, protecting the
      profits of the capitalists and landowners, is incapable of
      taking a number of revolutionary economic measures (food supply,
      etc.)

    

which are absolutely and urgently necessary in view of
      the impending economic catastrophe;


      6. This government, at the same time, is relying at present on
      the confidence of, and on an actual agreement with, the
      Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which is
      still the leading organisation for the majority of workers and
      soldiers, i. e., peasants;


      7. Every step of the Provisional Government, in both its
      domestic and foreign policies, is bound to open the eyes of the
      urban and rural proletarians and semi-proletarians and force
      various sections of the petty bourgeoisie to choose between one
      and the other political line.


Considering the above, the Conference resolves that:


      1. Extensive work has to be done to develop proletarian
      class-consciousness and to unite the urban and rural
      proletarians against the vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie,
      for only work of this nature can serve as a sure guarantee of
      the successful transfer of the entire state power into the hands
      of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies or other
      organs directly expressing the will of the majority of the
      people (organs of local self-government, the Constituent
      Assembly, etc.);


      2. This calls for many-sided activity within the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, for work aimed at increasing
      the number of these Soviets, consolidating their power, and
      welding together our Party’s proletarian internationalist groups
      in the Soviets;


      3. In order immediately to consolidate and widen the gains of
      the revolution in the local areas, it is necessary, with the
      backing of a solid majority of the local population, in every
      way to develop, organise, and strengthen its independent actions
      aimed at implementing liberties, dismissing the
      counter-revolutionary authorities, introducing economic
      measures, such as control over production and distribution,
      etc.;


      4. The political crisis of April 19–21 precipitated by the Note
      of the Provisional Government has shown that the government
      party of the Constitutional-Democrats, which is organising
      counter-revolutionary elements both in the army and in the
      streets, is now making attempts to shoot down the workers. In
      view of the unstable situation arising from the dual power, the
      repetition of such attempts is inevitable,

    

and it is the duty of
      the party of the proletariat to tell the people as forcibly as
      possible that, in order to avert the seriously threatening
      danger of such mass shootings of the proletariat as took place
      in Paris in the June days of 1848, it is necessary to organise
      and arm the proletariat, to establish the closest alliance
      between the proletariat and the revolutionary army, to break
      with the policy of confidence in the Provisional Government.

      Report on the Question of Revising the Party Programme

      April 28
(May 11)[1]


Comrades, this is how the question of revising the Party
      Programme now stands. The first draft of proposed changes in the
      doctrinal part of our programme and in a number of basic points
      in its political part was submitted to the committee. The whole
      programme must be revised as being utterly obsolete—a fact
      that was pointed out in Party circles long before the war. It
      appears, however, that there is not the slightest hope for
      discussing the proposed changes of the programme as a whole. On
      the other hand, the committee has come to the unanimous
      conclusion that a revision of the programme is absolutely
      essential, and that in a number of questions it is possible and
      necessary to indicate the direction in which such revision
      should be made. We have therefore agreed on the following draft
      resolution which I am going to read to you now, making brief
      comments as I go along. We have decided not to put forward
      precisely formulated theses at the present time, but merely to
      indicate along what lines this revision should be carried out.
    

      (Reads the resolution.)
    

      “The Conference considers it necessary to revise the Party
      Programme along the following lines:


      “1. Evaluating imperialism and the epoch of imperialist wars in
      connection with the approaching socialist revolution; fighting
      against the distortion of Marxism by the ‘defencists’, who have
      forgotten Marx’s slogan—‘The working men have no
country’.”[2]

 

This is so clear that it requires no explanation. As a matter of
      fact our Party’s policy has advanced considerably and,
      practically speaking, has already taken the stand proposed in
      this formulation.


      “2. Amending the theses and clauses dealing with the state; such
      amendment is to be in the nature of a demand for a democratic
      proletarian-peasant republic (i. e., a type of state functioning
      without police, without a standing army, and without a
      privileged bureaucracy), and not for a bourgeois parliamentary
      republic.”


Other formulations of this point had been proposed. One of them
      mentioned the experience of the Paris Commune and the experience
      of the period between the seventies and the eighties, but such a
      formulation is unsatisfactory and too general; another spoke
      about a republic of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and
      Peasants’ Deputies, but this formulation, too, was considered
      unsatisfactory by most of the comrades. A formulation, however,
      is needed; the point is not what an institution is called, but
      what its political character and structure is. By saying
      “proletarian-peasant republic”, we indicate its social content
      and political character.


      “3. Eliminating or amending what is out of date in the political
      programme.”


Practically speaking, our general political activities in the
      Soviets have gone along these lines; therefore, there can hardly
      be room for doubt that the change in this particular point of
      the programme and the precise formulation of our estimate of the
      moment in which the revolution found our Party, is not likely to
      provoke any disagreements.


      “4. Altering a number of points in the political minimum
      programme, so as to state more consistent democratic demands
      with greater precision.


      “5. Completely changing the economic part of the minimum
      programme, which in very many places is out of date, and points
      relating to public education.”


The main thing here is that these points have become out of
      date; the trade union movement has outstripped them.


      “6. Revising the agrarian programme in accordance with the
      adopted resolution on the agrarian question.


      “7. Inserting a demand for nationalisation of a number of
      syndicates, etc., now ripe for such a step.” 
 

A careful formulation has been chosen here, which can be
      narrowed or widened, depending upon what drafts will appear in
      print.


      “8. Adding an analysis of the main trends in modern socialism.”


An addendum like this was made to the Communist
      Manifesto.


      “The Conference instructs the Central Committee to work out,
      within two months, on the basis of the above suggestions, a
      draft for the Party Programme which is to be submitted for
      approval to the Party congress. The Conference calls upon all
      organisations and all Party members to consider drafts of the
      programme, to correct them, and to work out counter-drafts.”


It has been pointed out that it would be desirable to set up a
      scientific body and create a literature dealing with this
      subject, but we have neither the men nor the means for
      this. This is the resolution that should help in the speedy
      revision of our programme. This resolution will be forwarded
      abroad to enable our internationalist comrades to take part in
      revising the programme, which our Party has undertaken on the
      basis of the experience of the world war.


The new Party programme draft was completed after the October
      Revolution. The programme was adopted at the Eighth Congress of
      the R.C.P(B.) in March 1919.

      Report on the Agrarian Question

      April 28 (May 11)
    

Comrades, the agrarian question was threshed out so thoroughly
      by our Party during the first revolution that by this time, I
      think, our ideas on the subject are pretty well
      defined. Indirect proof of this is to be found in the fact that
      the committee of the Conference composed of comrades interested
      and fully versed in this subject have agreed on the proposed
      draft resolution without making any substantial corrections. I
      shall therefore confine myself to very brief remarks. And since
      all members have proof-sheets of the draft, there is no need to
      read it in full.


The present growth of the agrarian movement throughout Russia is
      perfectly obvious and undeniable. Our Party Programme, proposed
      by the Mensheviks and adopted by the Stockholm Congress in 1906,
      was refuted even in the course of the first Russian
      revolution. At that Congress the Mensheviks succeeded in getting
      their programme of municipalisation adopted. The essence of
      their programme was as follows: the peasant lands, communal and
      homestead, were to remain the property of the peasants while the
      landed estates were to be taken over by local self-government
      bodies. One of the Mensheviks’ chief arguments in favour of such
      a programme was that the peasants would never understand the
      transfer of peasant land to anyone but themselves. Anyone
      acquainted with the Minutes of the Stockholm Congress will
      recollect that this argument was particularly stressed both by
      Maslov, who made the report, and by Kostrov. We should not
      forget, as is often done nowadays, that this happened before the
      First Duma, when there was no objective

    

information about the
      character of the peasant movement and its strength. Everyone
      knew that Russia was aflame with the agrarian revolution, but no
      one knew how the agrarian movement would be organised, or in
      what direction the peasant revolution would develop. It was
      impossible to check whether the opinions expressed by the
      Congress were the real and practical views held by the peasants
      themselves. This was why the Mensheviks’ argument had carried
      such weight. Soon after the Stockholm Congress, we received the
      first serious indication of how the peasants viewed this
      question.In both the First and the Second Dumas, the peasants
      themselves put forward the Trudovik “Bill of
      the
104”.[2] I made a special study of the signatures to this
      bill, carefully studied the views of the various deputies, their
      class affiliations, and the extent to which they may be called
      peasants. I stated categorically in my book, which was burned by
      the tsarist censor but which I will
republish,[3] that the
      overwhelming majority of these 104 signatories were
      peasants. That bill called for the nationalisation of the
      land. The peasants said that the entire land would become the
      property of the state.


How, then, are we to account for the fact that in both Dumas the
      deputies representing the peasants of all Russia preferred
      nationalisation to the measure proposed in both Dumas by the
      Mensheviks from the point of view of the peasants’ interests?
      The Mensheviks proposed that the peasants retain the ownership
      of their own lands, and that only the landed estates should be
      given to the people; the peasants, however, maintained that the
      entire land should be given to the people. How are we to account
      for this? The Socialist-Revolutionaries say that owing to their
      commune organisation the Russian peasants favour socialisation,
      the labour principle. All this phraseology is absolutely devoid
      of common sense, it is nothing but words. But how are we to
      account for this? I think the peasants came to this conclusion
      because all landownership in Russia, both peasants’ and
      landowners’, communal and homestead, is permeated with old,
      semi-feudal relationships, and the peasants, considering market
      conditions, had to demand the transfer of the land to all the
      people. The peasants say that the tangle of old agrarian life
      can only be unravelled by nationalisation.

    

    
Their point of view is bourgeois; by equalitarian land tenure
      they mean the confiscation of the landed estates, but not the
      equalisation of individual proprietors. By nationalisation they
      mean an actual reallotment of all the land among the
      peasants. This is a grand bourgeois project. No peasant spoke
      about equalisation or socialisation; but they all said it was
      impossible to wait any longer, that all the land had to be
      cleared,in other words, that farming could not be carried on in
      the old way under twentieth-century conditions. The Stolypin
      Reform[4] has since then confused the land question still
      more. That is what the peasants have in mind when they demand
      nationalisation. It means a reallotment of all the land. There
      are to be no varied forms of landownership. There is not the
      slightest suggestion of socialisation. This demand by the
      peasants is called equalitarian because, as a brief summary of
      the statistics relating to land holdings in 1905 shows, 300
      peasant families held as much land (2,000 dessiatines)
      as one landowner’s family. In this sense it is, of course,
      equalitarian, but it does not imply that all small farms are to
      be equalised. The Bill of the 104 shows the opposite.


These are the essential points that have to be made in order to
      give scientific support to the view that nationalisation in
      Russia, as far as bourgeois democracy is concerned, is
      necessary. But it is also necessary for another reason—it
      deals a mighty blow at private ownership of the means of
      production. It is simply absurd to imagine that after the
      abolition of private property in land everything in Russia will
      remain as before.

Then follow some practical conclusions and demands. of the minor
      amendments in the draft I shall call attention to the
      following. The first point reads: “The party of the proletariat
      will support with all its might the immediate and complete
      confiscation of all landed estates....” Instead of “will
      support” we ought to say “will fight for”....Our point of view
      is not that the peasants have not enough land and that they need
      more. That is the current opinion. We say that the landed
      estates are the basis of oppression that crushes the peasants
      and keeps them backward. The question is not whether the
      peasants have or have not enough land. Down with
      serfdom!—this is the way the issue should be stated from
      the point of view of the revolutionary class

    

struggle, and not
      from the point of view of those officials who try to figure out
      how much land they have and by what norms it should be
      allotted. I suggest that the order of points 2 and 3 should be
      reversed, because, to us, the thing that matters is
      revolutionary initiative, and the law must be the result of
      it. If you wait until the law is written, and
      yourselves do not develop revolutionary initiative, you
      will have neither the law nor the land.


People very often object to nationalisation because, they say,
      it requires a colossal bureaucratic apparatus. That is true, but
      state landownership implies that every peasant is leasing the
      land from the state. The subletting of leaseholds is
      prohibited. But the question of how much and what kind of land
      the peasant shall lease must be entirely settled by the proper
      democratic, not bureaucratic, organ of authority.


For “farm-hands” we substitute “agricultural labourers”. Several
      comrades declared that the word “farm-hand” was offensive;
      objections were raised to this word. It should be deleted.


We should not speak now of proletarian-peasant committees or
      Soviets in connection with the settlement of the land question,
      for, as we see, the peasants have set up Soviets of Soldiers’
      Deputies, thus creating a division between the proletariat and
      the peasantry.


The petty-bourgeois defencist parties, as we know, stand for the
      land question being put off until the Constituent
      Assembly meets. We are for the immediate transfer of the
      land to the peasants in a highly organised manner. We are
      emphatically against anarchic seizing of land. You propose that
      the peasants enter into agreements with the landowners. We say
      that the land should be taken over and cultivated right now if
      we wish to avert famine, to save the country from the debacle
      which is advancing upon it with incredible speed. One cannot now
      accept the prescriptions offered by Shingaryov and the Cadets,
      who suggest waiting for the convocation of the Constituent
      Assembly, the date of which has not been fixed yet, or making
      arrangements with the landowners for renting land. The peasants
      are already seizing the land without paying for it, or paying
      only a quarter of the rent.

 

One comrade has brought a local resolution, from Penza Gubernia,
      saying that the peasants are seizing the landowners’
      agricultural implements, which however they do not divide among
      the households, but convert into common property. They are
      establishing a definite order of sequence, a rule, for using
      these implements to cultivate all the land. In resorting to such
      measures, they are guided by the desire to increase agricultural
      production. This is a matter of principle of tremendous
      significance, for all that the landowners and capitalists shout
      about it being anarchy. But if you are going to chatter and
      shout about this being anarchy, while the peasants sit back and
      wait, then you will indeed have anarchy. The peasants have shown
      that they understand farming conditions and social control
      better than the government officials, and apply such control a
      hundred times more efficiently. Such a measure, which is
      doubtless quite practicable in a small village, inevitably leads
      to more sweeping measures. When the peasant comes to learn
      this—and he has already begun to learn it—the
      knowledge of bourgeois professors will not be needed; he will
      himself come to the conclusion that it is essential to utilise
      the agricultural implements, not only in the small farms, but
      for the cultivation of all the land. How they do this is
      unimportant. We do not know whether they combine their
      individual plots for common ploughing and sowing or not, and it
      does not matter if they do it differently. What does matter is
      that the peasants are fortunate in not having to face a large
      number of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, who style themselves
      Marxists and Social-Democrats, and with a grave mien lecture the
      people about the time not yet being ripe for a socialist
      revolution and that therefore the peasants must not take the
      land immediately. Fortunately there are few such gentlemen in
      the Russian countryside. If the peasants contented themselves
      merely with taking the land by arrangement with the landowners,
      and failed to apply their experience collectively, failure would
      be inevitable, and the peasant committees would become a mere
      toy, a meaningless game. This is why we propose to add
Point 8[1]

to the draft resolution.

 

Once we know that the local peasants have themselves taken this
      initiative, it is our duty to say that we approve and recommend
      this initiative. Only this can serve as a guarantee that the
      revolution will not be limited to formal measures, that the
      struggle against the crisis will not remain a mere subject for
      departmental discussion and Shingaryov’s epistles, but that the
      peasants will actually go ahead in an organised way to combat
      famine and to increase production.

      Rejoinder to N. S. Angarsky

      During the Debate on the Agrarian Question

      April 28 (May 11)
    

Comrades, it seems to me that Comrade Angarsky is indulging in
      several contradictions. I speak about the material foundation of
      the urge towards nationalisation. The peasants have no idea of
      nationalisation. I say that the conditions of an all-Russia and
      international market exist, and this is expressed in the high
      prices of grain. Every peasant sees, knows, and feels the
      fluctuations of these prices, and farming has to conform to
      these conditions, to these prices. I say that the old
      landownership and the new farming system have absolutely
      diverged and this divergence explains why the peasants are
      pressing onward. The peasant is a proprietor, Comrade Angarsky
      says. Quite right. Stolypin wanted to use this as a basis for
      changing agrarian relations, he tried his hardest, but he
      failed, because such changes cannot be brought about without a
      revolutionary break-up. This, then, is the material foundation
      of the peasants’ urge towards the nationalisation of the land,
      although they are completely ignorant as to the real meaning of
      nationalisation. The peasant proprietor is instinctively
      inclined to maintain that the land is God’s, because it has
      become impossible to live under the old conditions of
      landownership. What Comrade Angarsky is proposing is a sheer
      misunderstanding.

    
The second paragraph says that peasant landownership is fettered
      all round, from top to bottom, by old semi-feudal ties and
      relationships. But does it say anything about the landed
      estates? It does not. Comrade Angarsky’s amendment is based on a
      misapprehension. He has ascribed to me things I never said,

    

things the peasants have no idea about. The peasants know the
      world situation by the prices of grain and consumer goods, and
      if a railway runs through his village, the peasant feels its
      effect through his own farm. To live the old way is
      impossible—that’s what the peasant feels, and he expresses
      this feeling in a radical demand for the abolition of the old
      system of landownership. The peasant wants to be a proprietor,
      but he wants to be one on reallocated land; he wants to farm
      land the ownership of which is conditioned by his present
      requirements, and not by those which were prescribed for him by
      officials. The peasant knows this perfectly well, but expresses
      it differently, of course, and it is this that forms the
      material foundation of his urge towards the nationalisation of
      the land.

## Agrarian Question









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Resolution on the Agrarian Question







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917

      Resolution on the Agrarian Question
    

The existence of landed estates in Russia is the material
      mainstay of the power of the feudalist landowners and a
      guarantee of the possible restoration of the monarchy. This
      system of landownership necessarily condemns the great mass of
      Russia’s population, the peasantry, to pauperism, bondage, and a
      downtrodden existence, and the entire country to backwardness in
      every sphere of life.
    

Peasant landownership in Russia, both of allotment land
      (communal and homestead) and private land (leased or purchased),
      is fettered all round, from top to bottom, by old semi-feudal
      ties and relationships, by the division of the peasants into
      categories inherited from the time of serfdom, by the open field
      system, and so on, and so forth. The need for breaking down all
      these antiquated and harmful restrictions, for “clearing” the
      land; and reconstructing and readjusting all the relations of
      landownership and agriculture to the new conditions of Russian
      and world economy, forms the material foundation of the
      peasants’ urge towards the nationalisation of all the
      land in the state.


Whatever the petty-bourgeois
      utopias in which all Narodnik
      parties and groups array the struggle of the peasant masses
      against feudalist big landownership and all the feudal fetters
      of the entire system of landownership and land tenure in Russia,
      that struggle is itself an expression of a thoroughly
      bourgeois-democratic, undoubtedly progressive, and economically
      essential striving resolutely to break all those fetters.


Nationalisation of the land, though being a bourgeois measure,
      implies freedom for the class struggle and freedom of land
      tenure from all non-bourgeois adjuncts to the greatest

    

possible
      degree conceivable in a capitalist society. Moreover,
      nationalisation of the land, representing as it does the
      abolition of private ownership of land, would, in effect, deal
      such a powerful blow to private ownership of all the means of
      production in general that the party of the proletariat must
      facilitate such a reform in every possible way.


On the other hand, the well-to-do peasants of Russia long ago
      evolved the elements of a peasant bourgeoisie, and the Stolypin
      agrarian reform has undoubtedly strengthened, augmented, and
      reinforced these elements. At the other pole of the rural
      population, the agricultural wage workers, the proletarians, and
      the mass of semi-proletarian peasantry, who stand close to the
      proletarians, have likewise gained in strength and numbers.


The more determined and consistent the break-up and elimination
      of the landed estates and the more determined and consistent the
      bourgeois-democratic agrarian reform in Russia in general, the
      more vigorous and speedy will be the development of the class
      struggle of the agricultural proletariat against the well-to-do
      peasants (the peasant bourgeoisie) [kulaks].


The fate and the outcome of the [February] Russian revolution—unless
      the incipient proletarian revolution in Europe exercises a
      direct and powerful influence on our country—will depend on
      whether the urban proletariat succeeds in rallying the rural
      proletariat together with the mass of rural semi-proletarians
      behind it, or whether this mass follows the lead of the peasant
      bourgeoisie, which is gravitating towards an alliance with Guchkov
      and Milyukov,
      with the capitalists and landowners, and towards the
      counter-revolution in general.


In view of this class situation and balance of forces the
      Conference resolves that:


      1) The party of the proletariat will fight with all its might
      for the immediate and complete confiscation of all landed
      estates in Russia (and also crown lands, church lands, etc.,
      etc.);


      2) The party will vigorously advocate the immediate transfer of
      all lands to the peasantry organised in Soviets of Peasants
      Deputies, or in other organs of local self-government elected in
      a really democratic way and entirely independent of the
      landowners and officials;
 
 

      3) The party of the proletariat demands the nationalisation of
      all the land in the country; nationalisation, which signifies
      the transfer of the right of ownership of all land to the state,
      vests the right of administering the land in local democratic
      institutions;


      4) The party must wage a determined struggle, on the one hand,
      against the Provisional Government, which, both through the
      mouth of
      Shingaryov

      and by its collective utterances, is trying to force the
      peasants to come to a “voluntary agreement with the landowners”,
      i. e., is trying virtually to impose upon them a reform which
      suits the interests of the landowners, and is threatening the
      peasants with punishment for “arbitrary action”, that is, with
      the use of violence by a minority of the population (the
      landowners and capitalists) against the majority; on the other
      hand, against the petty-bourgeois vacillations of the majority
      of the Narodniks and the Menshevik
      Social-Democrats, who are advising the peasants not to take
      all the land pending the convocation of the Constituent
      Assembly;


      5) The party advises the peasants to take the land in an
      organised way, not allowing the slightest damage to property,
      and taking measures to increase production;


      6) Agrarian reforms, by and large, can be successful and durable
      only provided the whole state is democratised, i. e., provided,
      on the one hand, the police, the standing army, and the
      privileged bureaucracy are abolished, and provided, on the
      other, there exists a system of broad local self-government
      completely free from supervision and tutelage from above;


      7) The separate and independent organisation of the agricultural
      proletariat must be undertaken immediately and everywhere, both
      in the form of Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies (as
      well as of separate Soviets of deputies of the semi-proletarian
      peasantry) and in the form of proletarian groups or factions
      within the general Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, in all local
      and municipal government bodies, etc.,




 8) The party must support the
    initiative of those peasant committees which in a number of
    localities in Russia are handing over the livestock and
    agricultural implements of the landowners to the peasants
    organised in those committees,

    

to be used in a socially regulated
    manner for the cultivation of all the land;


      9) The party of the proletariat must advise the rural
      proletarians and semi-proletarians to strive to convert every
      landed estate into a fair-sized model farm to be run on public
      lines by the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies under
      the direction of agricultural experts and with the application
      of the best technique.

      Resolution on Uniting the Internationalists

      Against the Petty-Bourgeois Defencist Bloc
    

Taking into consideration:
    
(1) that the parties of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries,

      Menshevik
      Social-Democrats, etc., have, in the great majority of
      cases, adopted the stand of “revolutionary
      defencism”, that is, support of the imperialist war (voting
      in favour of the loan and supporting the Provisional
      Government which represents the interests of Capital);


      (2) that these parties in all their policies defend the
      interests and point of view of the
      petty

bourgeoisie and corrupt the proletariat with bourgeois
influence by trying to persuade it that it is possible, by
means of agreements, “control”, participation in the cabinet,
etc., to change the government’s imperialist policy and divert
it from the path of counter-revolutionary encroachments on
liberty;


      (3) that this policy encourages and enhances the attitude of
      unreasoning trust on the part of the masses towards the
      capitalists, an attitude which constitutes the chief obstacle to
      the further development of the revolution, and a possible source
      of the revolution’s defeat by the landowner and bourgeois
      counter-revolution,


the Conference resolves that:
    

      (1) unity with parties and groups which are pursuing such a
      policy is absolutely impossible;


      (2) closer relations and unity with groups and trends that have
      adopted a real internationalist stand are necessary on the basis
      of a definite break with the policy of petty-bourgeois betrayal
      of socialism.

Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Resolution on the Soviets of Workers' And Soldiers' Deputies







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917



    

17

      Resolution on the Soviets

      of Workers’ And Soldiers’ Deputies
    

The Conference has discussed the reports and communications of
      comrades working in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies in different parts of Russia and states that:


In many provincial areas the revolution is progressing in the
      following way: the proletariat and the peasantry, on their own
      initiative, are organising Soviets and dismissing the old
      authorities; a proletarian and peasant militia is being set up;
      all lands are being transferred to the peasants; workers’
      control over the factories and the eight-hour day have been
      introduced and wages have been increased; production is being
      maintained, and workers control the distribution of food, etc.


This growth of the revolution in the provinces in depth and
      scope is, on the one hand, the growth of a movement for
      transferring all power to the Soviets and putting the workers
      and peasants themselves in control of production. on the other
      hand, it serves as a guarantee for the build-up of forces, on a
      national scale, for the second stage of the revolution, which
      must transfer all state power to the Soviets or to other organs
      directly expressing the will of the majority of the nation
      (organs of local self-government, the Constituent Assembly,
      etc.).


In the capitals and in a few other large cities the task of
      transferring state power to the Soviets is particularly
      difficult and requires an especially long period of preparation
      of the proletariat’s forces. This is where the largest forces of
      the bourgeoisie are concentrated, where a policy of compromise
      with the bourgeoisie is most strongly in evidence, a policy
      which often holds back the revolutionary initiative of the
      masses and

    

weakens their independence; this is particularly
      dangerous in view of the leading role of these Soviets for the
      provinces.


It is, therefore, the task of the proletarian party, on the one
      hand, to support in every possible way the indicated development
      of the revolution locally, and, on the other to conduct a
      systematic struggle within the Soviets (by means of propaganda
      and new elections) for the triumph of the proletarian line. The
      party must concentrate all its efforts and all its attention on
      winning over the mass of workers and soldiers, and must draw a
      line between the policy of the proletariat and that of the petty
      bourgeoisie, between the internationalist policy and the
      defencist policy, between the revolutionary and the opportunist
      policy. The party must organise and arm the workers and build up
      their forces for the next stage of the revolution.


The Conference repeats that it is necessary to carry out
      many-sided activity within the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies, to increase the number of Soviets, to consolidate
      their power, and to weld together our Party’s proletarian
      internationalist groups within the Soviets.

    Question

      Speech on the National Question

      April 29 (May 12)
    

Beginning from 1903, when our Party adopted its programme, we
      have been encountering violent opposition on the part of the
      Polish comrades. If you study the Minutes of the Second
      Congress you will see that they were using the same
      arguments then that they are using now, and that the Polish
      Social-Democrats walked out from that Congress because they held
      that recognition of the right of nations to self-determination
      was unacceptable to them. Ever since then we have been coming up
      against the same question. Though imperialism already existed in
      1903, the Polish Social-Democrats made no mention of it in their
      arguments. They are making the same strange and monstrous error
      now as they were then. These people want to put our Party’s
      stand on a par with that of the chauvinists.


Owing to long oppression by Russia, Poland’s policy is a wholly
      nationalist one, and the whole Polish nation is obsessed with
      one idea—revenge on the Muscovites. No one has oppressed
      the Poles more than the Russian people, who served in the hands
      of the tsars as the executioner of Polish freedom. In no nation
      does hatred of Russia sit so deep as with the Poles; no nation
      dislikes Russia so intensely as the Poles. As a result we have a
      strange thing. Because of the Polish bourgeoisie, Poland has
      become an obstacle to the socialist movement. The whole world
      could go to the devil so long as Poland was free. Of course,
      this way of putting the question is a mockery of
      internationalism. Of course, Poland is now a victim of violence,
      but for the Polish nationalists to count on Russia liberating
      Poland—that would be treason to the International. The
      Polish nationalists have

    

so imbued the Polish people with their
      views that this is how the situation is regarded in Poland.


The Polish Social-Democratic comrades have rendered a great
      historic service by advancing the slogan of internationalism and
      declaring that the fraternal union of the proletariat of all
      countries is of supreme importance to them and that they will
      never go to war for the liberation of Poland. This is to their
      credit, and this is why we have always regarded only these
      Polish Social-Democrats as socialists. The others are patriots,
      Polish Plekhanovs. But this peculiar position, when, in order to
      safeguard socialism, people were forced to struggle against a
      rabid and morbid nationalism, has produced a strange state of
      affairs: comrades come to us saying that we must give up the
      idea of Poland’s freedom, her right to secession.


Why should we Great Russians, who have been oppressing more
      nations than any other people, deny the right to secession for
      Poland, Ukraine, or Finland? We are asked to become chauvinists,
      because by doing so we would make the position of
      Social-Democrats in Poland less difficult. We do not pretend to
      seek to liberate Poland, because the Polish people live between
      two states that are capable of fighting. Instead of telling the
      Polish workers that only those Social-Democrats are real
      democrats who maintain that the Polish people ought to be free,
      since there is no place for chauvinists in a socialist party,
      the Polish Social-Democrats argue that, just because they find
      the union with Russian workers advantageous, they are opposed to
      Poland’s secession. They have a perfect right to do so. But
      people don’t want to understand that to strengthen
      internationalism you do not have to repeat the same words. What
      you have to do is to stress, in Russia, the freedom of secession
      for oppressed nations and, in Poland, their freedom to
      unite. Freedom to unite implies freedom to secede. We Russians
      must emphasise freedom to secede, while the Poles must emphasise
      freedom to unite.


We notice here a number of sophisms involving a complete
      renunciation of Marxism. Comrade Pyatakov’s stand repeats that
      of Rosa
Luxemburg....[1]

(Holland is an example.)

    

      This is how Comrade Pyatakov reasons, and this is how he refutes
      himself, for in theory he denies freedom of secession, but to
      the people he says that anyone opposing freedom of secession is
      not a socialist. Comrade Pyatakov has been saying things here
      that are hopelessly muddled. In Western Europe most countries
      settled their national questions long ago. It is Western Europe
      that is referred to when it is said that the national question
      has been settled. Comrade Pyatakov, however, puts this where it
      does not belong—to Eastern Europe, and we find ourselves in
      a ridiculous position.


Just think of the dreadful mess that results! Finland
      is right next door to us. Comrade Pyatakov has no definite
      answer for Finland and gets all mixed up. In yesterday’s
      Rabochaya Gazeta you read that the movement for
      separation is growing in Finland. Finns arriving here tell us
      that separatism is growing there because the Cadets
      refuse to grant the country complete autonomy. A crisis is
      approaching there, dissatisfaction with Governor-General
      Rodichev is rife, but Rabochaya Gazeta writes that
      the Finns should wait for the Constituent
      Assembly, because an agreement will there be reached between
      Finland and Russia. What do they mean by agreement? The Finns
      must declare that they are entitled to decide their destiny in
      their own way, and any Great Russian who denies this right is a
      chauvinist. It would be another thing if we said to the Finnish
      worker: Decide what is best for
yourself....[2]


Comrade Pyatakov simply rejects our slogan, saying that it means
      giving no slogan for the socialist revolution, but he himself
      gives no appropriate slogan. The method of socialist revolution
      under the slogan “Down with frontiers” is all muddled up. We
      have not succeeded in publishing the article in which I called
      this view “Imperialist
Economism”.[3]

What does the “method” of socialist
      revolution under the slogan “Down with frontiers” mean? We
      maintain that the state is necessary, and a state presupposes
      frontiers. The state, of course, may hold a bourgeois
      government, but we need the Soviets.
      But even Soviets are confronted with the question of
      frontiers. What does “Down with frontiers”

    

mean? It is the
      beginning of anarchy....The “method” of socialist revolution
      under the slogan “Down with frontiers” is simply a mess. When
      the time is ripe for socialist revolution, when it finally
      occurs, it will spread to other countries. We shall help it
      along, but in what manner, we do not know. “The method of
      socialist revolution” is just a meaningless phrase. We stand for
      the settlement of problems which the bourgeois revolution has
      left unsolved. Our attitude to the separatist movement is
      indifferent, neutral. If Finland, Poland or Ukraine secede from
      Russia, there is nothing bad in that. What is wrong with it?
      Anyone who says that is a chauvinist. One must be mad to
      continue Tsar Nicholas’s policy. Didn’t Norway secede from
      Sweden? Alexander I and Napoleon once bartered nations, the
      tsars once traded Poland. Are we to continue this policy of the
      tsars? This is repudiation of the tactics of internationalism,
      this is chauvinism at its worst. What is wrong with Finland
      seceding? After the secession of Norway from Sweden mutual trust
      increased between the two peoples, between the proletariat of
      these countries. The Swedish landowners wanted to start a war,
      but the Swedish workers refused to be drawn into such a war.


All the Finns want now is autonomy. We are for Finland receiving
      complete freedom, because then there will be greater trust in
      Russian democracy and the Finns will not separate. While
      Mr. Rodichev goes to Finland to haggle over autonomy, our
      Finnish comrades come here and say, “We want autonomy.” But what
      they get is a broadside, and the answer: “Wait for the
      Constituent Assembly.” But we say: “Any Russian socialist who
      denies Finland freedom is a chauvinist.”


We say that frontiers are determined by the will of the [local] population. Russia, don’t you dare
      fight over Kurland!
      Germany, get your armies out of Kurland! That is how we solve
      the secession problem. The proletariat cannot use force, because
      it must not prevent the peoples from obtaining their
      freedom. Only when the socialist revolution has become a
      reality, and not a method, will the slogan “Down with frontiers”
      be a correct slogan. Then we shall say: Comrades, come to us....

War is a different matter entirely. If need be, we shall not draw
      the line at a revolutionary war. We are not pacifists....

    

When
      we have Milyukov
      sitting here and sending Rodichev to Finland to shamefully
      haggle with the Finnish people,we say to the Russian people:
      Don’t you dare coerce Finland; no nation can be free that
      oppresses other
nations.[4] In the resolution
      concerning Borgbjerg we say: Withdraw your troops and let the
      nation settle the question itself. But, if the Soviet takes over
      power tomorrow, that will not be a “method of socialist
      revolution”, and we shall then say: Germany, get your troops out
      of Poland, and Russia, get your troops out of Armenia. If we did
      otherwise we should be deceiving people.


Comrade Dzerzhinsky
      tells us that in his oppressed Poland everybody is a
      chauvinist. But not a single Pole has said a word about Finland
      or Ukraine. We have been arguing over this so much since 1903
      that it is becoming difficult to talk about it. Do as you
      please....Anyone who does not accept this point of view is an
      annexationist and a chauvinist. We are for a fraternal union of
      all nations. If there is a Ukrainian republic and a Russian
      republic, there will be closer contact and greater trust between
      the two. If the Ukrainians see that we have a Soviet republic,
      they will not secede, but if we have a Milyukov republic, they
      will. When Comrade Pyatakov said in self-contradiction that he
      is against the forcible retention of nations within the
      frontiers, he actually recognised the right of nations to
      self-determination. We certainly do not want the peasant in Khiva
      to live under the Khan of Khiva. By developing our revolution we
      shall influence the oppressed people. Propaganda among the
      oppressed mass must follow only this line.


Any Russian socialist who does not recognise Finland’s and
      Ukraine’s right to freedom will degenerate into a
      chauvinist. And no sophisms or references to his “method” will
      ever help him to justify himself.

      Resolution on the National Question
    

The policy of national oppression, inherited from the autocracy
      and monarchy; is maintained by the landowners, capitalists, and
      petty bourgeoisie in order to protect their class privileges and
      to cause disunity among the workers of the various
      nationalities. Modern imperialism, which increases the tendency
      to subjugate weaker nations, is a new factor intensifying
      national oppression.


The elimination of national oppression, if at all achievable in
      capitalist society, is possible only under a consistently
      democratic republican system and state administration that
      guarantee complete equality for all nations and languages.


The right of all the nations forming part of Russia freely to
      secede and form independent states must be recognised. To deny
      them this right, or to fail to take measures guaranteeing its
      practical realisation, is equivalent to supporting a policy of
      seizure or annexation. Only the recognition by the proletariat
      of the right of nations to secede can ensure complete solidarity
      among the workers of the various nations and help to bring the
      nations closer together on truly democratic lines.


The conflict which has arisen at the present time between
      Finland and the Russian Provisional Government strikingly
      demonstrates that denial of the right to free secession leads to
      a direct continuation of the policy of tsarism.


The right of nations freely to secede must not be confused with
      the advisability of secession by a given nation at a given
      moment. The party of the proletariat must decide the latter
      question quite independently in each particular

    

case, having
      regard to the interests of social development as a whole and the
      interests of the class struggle of the proletariat for
      socialism.


The Party demands broad regional autonomy, the abolition of
      supervision from above, the abolition of a compulsory official
      language, and the fixing of the boundaries of the self-governing
      and autonomous regions in accordance with the economic and
      social conditions, the national composition of the population,
      and so forth, as assessed by the local population itself.


The party of the proletariat emphatically rejects what is known
      as “national cultural autonomy”, under which education, etc., is
      removed from the control of the state and put in the control of
      some kind of national diets. National cultural autonomy
      artificially divides the workers living in one locality, and
      even working in the same industrial enterprise, according to
      their various “national cultures”; in other words, it
      strengthens the ties between the workers and the bourgeois
      culture of their nations, whereas the aim of the
      Social-Democrats is to develop the international culture of the
      world proletariat.


The party demands that a fundamental law be embodied in the
      constitution annulling all privileges enjoyed by any one nation
      and all infringements of the rights of national minorities.


The interests of the working class demand that the workers of
      all nationalities in Russia should have common proletarian
      organisations: political, trade union, co-operative educational
      institutions, and so forth. Only the merging of the workers of
      the various nationalities into such common organisations will
      make it possible for the proletariat to wage a successful
      struggle against international Capital and bourgeois
      nationalism.

Comrade Zinoviev
      admitted that our visit to Stockholm would be the last one, and
      that we would only be there for the purpose of
information.[1]


When Grimm invited us to the conference, I refused to go,
      because I realised that it would be useless to talk to people
      who stood for  social-chauvinism.
      We say: “No participation with social-chauvinists.” We come and
      address ourselves to the  Zimmerwald
      Left. Grimm had a moral and formal right to draw up today’s
      resolution. His right was based on  Kautsky
      in Germany, on  Longuet
      in France. This is how the matter stands officially: Grimm has
      announced, “We will disband our bureau, as soon as Huysmans
      organises a bureau.” When we said that such a solution was not
      acceptable to Zimmerwald, he agreed, but said “this is the
      opinion of the majority”—and that was true.


As to our visit. “We shall get information, we shall get in
      touch with the Zimmerwald Left,” it is claimed. There is very
      little hope of our winning over anybody else. Let us have no
      illusions; first, the visit will not take place; second, if it
      does, it will be our last; third, we cannot, for technical
      reasons, win over the elements that wish to break with the
      social-chauvinists. But let Comrade Nogin make the first and
      Comrade Zinoviev the last visit to Stockholm. As for me, I
      express the very legitimate wish that this “last-visit” attempt
      should be made as quickly and successfully as possible.

[1]
This
      refers to participation in the proposed third conference of the
      internationalist socialists due to beheld in Stockholm on May 18,
      1917.
It was held in August 1917. By decision of the April Conference, the Bolsheviks
      attended it. Lenin disagreed with this decision and voted
      against the resolution on the situation in the International and
      the tasks of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.).



Lenin considered attendance of the Bolsheviks at this conference possible
only for purposes of information.

      He wrote about this in his pamphlet The Tasks of the Proletariat
      in Our Revolution (see p. 82 of this volume).  In the postscript
      to the pamphlet, written in May 1917, Lenin calls this decision of
      the conference a mistake (see pp. 89–90 of this volume).

## In Favour of
    the Resolution









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Speech in Favour of the Resolution on the Current Situation April 29 (May 12)







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917

      Speech in Favour of the Resolution on the Current Situation
      April 29 (May 12)
    

In the resolution on the current situation it would be wrong to
      speak only of Russian conditions. The war has bound us together
      so inseparably that it would be a great mistake on our part to
      ignore the sum total of international relations.
    

The main question dealt with in the resolution is this: what
      tasks will confront the Russian proletariat in the event of the
      world movement raising the issue of a social revolution?


      “The objective conditions for a socialist revolution, which
      undoubtedly existed even before the war in the more developed
      and advanced countries, have been ripening with tremendous
      rapidity as a result of the war. Small and middle enterprises
      are being squeezed out and ruined at a faster rate than
      ever. The concentration and internationalisation of capital are
      making gigantic strides; monopoly capitalism is developing into
      state monopoly capitalism. In a number of countries regulation
      of production and distribution by society is being introduced by
      force of circumstances. Some countries are introducing universal
      labour conscription.”


Before the war we had the monopoly of trusts and syndicates;
      since the war we have had a state monopoly. Universal labour
      conscription is something new, something that constitutes part
      of a socialist whole—this is often over looked by those who
      fear to examine the concrete situation.


The first part of the resolution concentrates on an analysis of
      the conditions of capitalist economy throughout the world. It is
      noteworthy that twenty-seven years ago Engels

    

pointed out that
      to describe capitalism as something that “is distinguished by
      its planlessness” and to overlook the role played by the trusts
      was unsatisfactory. Engels remarked that “when we come to the
      trust, then planlessness disappears”, though there is
      capitalism. This remark is all the more pertinent today, when we
      have a military state, when we have state monopoly
      capitalism. Planning does not make the worker less of a slave,
      but it enables the capitalist to make his profits “according to
      plan”. Capitalism is now evolving directly into its higher,
      regulated, form.


The second part of the resolution needs no explanations.


The third part requires more detailed comment. (Reads the
      resolution.)


      “Operating as it does in one of the most backward countries of
      Europe amidst a vast population of small peasants, the
      proletariat of Russia cannot aim at immediately putting into
      effect socialist changes.


      “But it would be a grave error, and in effect even a complete
      desertion to the bourgeoisie, to infer from this that the
      working class must support the bourgeoisie, or that it must keep
      its activities within limits acceptable to the petty
      bourgeoisie, or that the proletariat must renounce its leading
      role in the matter of explaining to the people the urgency of
      taking a number of practical steps towards socialism for which
      the time is now ripe.”


From the first premise it is customary to make the conclusion
      that “Russia is a backward country, a peasant, petty-bourgeois
      country, therefore there can be no question of a social
      revolution”. People forget, however, that the war has placed us
      in extraordinary circumstances, and that side by side with the
      petty bourgeoisie we have Big Capital. But what are the Soviets
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies to do when they assume power?
      Should they go over to the bourgeoisie? Our answer is—the
      working class will continue its class struggle.


What is possible and what is necessary under the power of the
      Soviets?

First of all, the nationalisation of the land. Nationalisation of
      the land is a bourgeois measure, it does not exclude capitalism,
      nor does capitalism exclude it, but the blow it

    

will deal to
      private property will be a heavy one. Further (reads
      on):


      “the establishment of state control over all banks, and their
      amalgamation into a single central bank; also control over the
      insurance agencies and big capitalist syndicates (for example,
      the Sugar Syndicate, the Coal Syndicate, the Metal Syndicate,
      etc.), and the gradual introduction of a more just progressive
      tax on incomes and properties. Economically, these measures are
      timely; technically, they can be carried out immediately;
      politically they are likely to receive the support of
      the overwhelming majority of the peasants, who have everything
      to gain by these reforms.”


This point evoked discussion. I already had occasion to speak of
      this in Pravda in connection with Plekhanov’s
      articles. “When they talk about socialism being impossible,” I
      wrote, “they try to speak of the latter in a way most
      advantageous to themselves, they represent it vaguely,
      indefinitely, as some sort of a jump.” Kautsky himself wrote:
      “No socialist speaks of the abolition of private property in the
      case of the peasants.” But does that mean that existing
      large-scale capital must make it unnecessary for the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies to control production, to
      control the sugar and other syndicates? This measure is not
      socialism—it is a transitional measure, but the carrying
      out of such measures together with the existence of the Soviets
      will bring about a situation in which Russia will have one foot
      in socialism—we say one foot because the peasant majority
      controls the other part of the country’s economy. It cannot be
      denied that economically we are ripe for a change. To effect
      that change politically, we must have a majority, and the
      majority are peasants who are naturally interested in such
      changes. Whether they will prove sufficiently organised is
      another matter; we cannot speak for them.


An old and often repeated objection to socialism is that
      socialism means “barracks for the masses” and “mass
      bureaucracy”. We must now put the issue of socialism
      differently; we must raise it from the level of the abstract to
      the level of the concrete, namely, the nationalisation of the
      land, control over the syndicates, etc. (reads the
      resolution).


      “All these and other similar measures can and should be not only
      discussed and prepared for enforcement on a

    

national scale in
      the event of all power passing to the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians, but also implemented by the local
      revolutionary organs of power of the whole people when the
      opportunity arises.


      “Great care and discretion should be exercised in carrying out
      the above measures; a solid majority of the population must be
      won over and this majority must be clearly convinced of the
      country’s practical preparedness for any particular
      measure. This is the direction in which the class-conscious
      vanguard of the workers must focus its attention and efforts,
      because it is the bounden duty of these workers to help the
      peasants find a way out of the present debacle.”


These last words are the crux of the whole resolution; we put
      the issue of socialism not as a jump, but as a practical way out
      of the present debacle.


      “This is a bourgeois revolution, it is therefore useless to
      speak of socialism,” say our opponents. But we say just the
      opposite: “Since the bourgeoisie cannot find a way out of the
      present situation, the revolution is bound to go on.” We must
      not confine ourselves to democratic phrases; we must make the
      situation clear to the masses, and indicate a number of
      practical measures to them, namely, they must take over the
      syndicates—control them through the Soviets, etc. When all
      such measures are carried out, Russia will be standing with one
      foot in socialism. Our economic programme must show a way out of
      the debacle—this is what should guide our actions.

## Current Situation









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Resolution on the Current Situation







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917

      Resolution on the Current Situation
    

The world war, brought about by the struggle of world trusts and
      banking capital for domination over the world market, has
      already led to the mass destruction of material values, to
      exhaustion of productive forces, and to such a growth in the war
      industry that it is impossible to produce even the absolutely
      necessary minimum of consumer goods and means of production.


The present war, therefore, has brought humanity to an impasse
      and placed it on the brink of ruin.


The objective conditions for a socialist revolution, which
      undoubtedly existed even before the war in the more developed
      and advanced countries, have been ripening with tremendous
      rapidity as a result of the war. Small and middle enterprises
      are being squeezed out and ruined at a faster rate than
      ever. The concentration and internationalisation of capital are
      making gigantic strides; monopoly capitalism is developing into
      state monopoly capitalism. In a number of countries regulation
      of production and distribution by society is being introduced by
      force of circumstances. Some countries are introducing universal
      labour conscription.


Under private ownership of the means of production, all these
      steps towards greater monopolisation and control of production
      by the state are inevitably accompanied by intensified
      exploitation of the working people, by an increase in
      oppression; it becomes more difficult to resist the exploiters,
      and reaction and military despotism grow. at the same time these
      steps inevitably lead to a tremendous growth in the profits of
      the big capitalists at the expense of all other sections of the
      population. The working people for decades to come are forced to
      pay tribute to the capitalists in the form of

    

interest payments
      on war loans running into thousands of millions. But with
      private ownership of the means of production abolished and state
      power passing completely to the proletariat, these very
      conditions are a pledge of success for society’s transformation
      that will do away with the exploitation of man by man and ensure
      the well-being of everyone.
    
 *     *  * 

On the other hand, the course of events is clearly confirming
      the forecast of the socialists of the whole world who, precisely
      in connection with the imperialist war, then impending and now
      raging unanimously declared in the 1912 Basle Manifesto that a
      proletarian revolution was inevitable.


The Russian revolution is only the first stage of the first of
      the proletarian revolutions which are the inevitable result of
      war.


In all countries a spirit of rebellion against the capitalist
      class is growing among the masses, and the proletariat is
      becoming aware that only the transfer of power to the
      proletariat and the abolition of private ownership of the means
      of production can save humanity from ruin.


In all countries, especially in the most advanced, Britain and
      Germany, hundreds of socialists who have not gone over to the
      side of “their own” national bourgeoisie have been thrown into
      prison by the capitalist governments. By this action the latter
      have clearly demonstrated their fear of the mounting proletarian
      revolution. In Germany the impending revolution is apparent both
      in the mass strikes, which have assumed particularly large
      proportions in recent weeks, and in the growth of fraternisation
      between the German and Russian soldiers at the front.


Fraternal trust and unity are gradually being restored among the
      workers of different countries, the very workers who are now
      killing each other in the interests of the capitalists. This, in
      turn, will create conditions for united revolutionary action by
      the workers of different countries. Only such action can
      guarantee the most systematic development and the most likely
      success of the world socialist revolution.
     
 *     *  * 
 

Operating as it does in one of the most backward countries of
      Europe amidst a vast population of small peasants, the
      proletariat of Russia cannot aim at immediately putting into
      effect socialist changes.
    

But it would be a grave error, and in effect even a complete
      desertion to the bourgeoisie, to infer from this that the
      working class must support the bourgeoisie, or that it must keep
      its activities within limits acceptable to the petty
      bourgeoisie, or that the proletariat must renounce its leading
      role in the matter of explaining to the people the urgency of
      taking a number of practical steps towards socialism for which
      the time is now ripe.
    

These steps are: first, nationalisation of the land. This
      measure, which does not directly go beyond the framework of the
      bourgeois system, would, at the same time, be a heavy blow at
      private ownership of the means of production, and as such would
      strengthen the influence of the socialist proletariat over the
      semi-proletariat in the countryside.
    

The next steps are the establishment of state control over all
      banks, and their amalgamation into a single central bank; also
      control over the insurance agencies and big capitalist
      syndicates (for example, the Sugar Syndicate, the Coal
      Syndicate, the Metal Syndicate, etc.), and the gradual
      introduction of a more just progressive tax on incomes and
      properties. Economically, these measures are timely;
      technically, they can be carried out immediately; politically
      they are likely to receive the support of the
      overwhelming majority of the peasants, who have everything to
      gain by these reforms.
    

The Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other
      Deputies, which now cover Russia with a dense and growing
      network, could also introduce, parallel with the above measures,
      universal labour conscription, for on the one hand the character
      of the Soviets guarantees that all these new reforms will be
      introduced only when an overwhelming majority of the people has
      clearly and firmly realised the practical need for them; on the
      other hand their character guarantees that the reforms will not
      be sponsored by the police and officials, but will be carried
      out by way of voluntary participation of the organised and armed
      masses of the proletariat and peasantry in the management of
      their own affairs.
    
 

All these and other similar measures can and should be not only
      discussed and prepared for enforcement on a national scale in
      the event of all power passing to the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians, but also implemented by the local
      revolutionary organs of power of the whole people when the
      opportunity arises.
    

Great care and discretion should be exercised in carrying out
      the above measures; a solid majority of the population must be
      won over and this majority must be clearly convinced of the
      country’s practical preparedness for any particular
      measure. This is the direction in which the class-conscious
      vanguard of the workers must focus its attention and efforts,
      because it is the bounden duty of these workers to help the
      peasants find a way out of the present debacle.

## Close of the
    Conference









Lenin: 1917/7thconf: Concluding Speech at the Closing of the Conference April 29 (May 12)







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
APRIL 24–29, 1917

      Concluding Speech at the Closing of the Conference

      April 29 (May 12)
    

Owing to lack of time Lenin made no speech in favour of changing
      the name of the Party, but referred the delegates to his newly
      written pamphlet The Tasks of the
      Proletariat in Our
Revolution,[1]

 which will serve as material
      for discussion in the local Party organisations.


A word about the Conference.
    

We have had little time and a lot of work. The conditions in
      which our Party finds itself are difficult. The defencist
      parties are strong, but the proletarian masses look with
      disfavour upon defencism and the imperialist war. Our
      resolutions are not written with a view to the broad masses, but
      they will serve to unify the activities of our agitators and
      propagandists, and the reader will find in them guidance in his
      work. We have to speak to the millions; we must draw fresh
      forces from among the masses, we must call for more developed
      class-conscious workers who would popularise our theses in a way
      the masses would understand. We shall endeavour in our pamphlets
      to present our resolutions in a more popular form, and hope that
      our comrades will do the same thing locally. The proletariat
      will find in our resolutions material to guide it in its
      movement towards the second stage of our revolution.

Workers, comrades!
    

The All-Russia Conference of the Russian Social-Democratic
      Labour Party, united by its Central Committee and  known simply
      as the Bolshevik Party, is over.
    

The Conference has adopted very important resolutions on all the
      fundamental issues of the revolution and the full text of them
      is published below.
    

The revolution is passing through a crisis. This could be seen
      in the streets of Petrograd and Moscow between  April
      19  and April 21. This has been admitted by the
      Provisional Government. It has been admitted by the  Executive
      Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’  and Soldiers’
      Deputies. Still further confirmation of it has been given, as I
      pen these lines, by the resignation of Guchkov.
    

This crisis of state power, this crisis of the revolution, is no
      accident. The Provisional Government is a government of
      landowners and capitalists who are tied up with Russian  and
      Anglo-French capital and compelled to continue the imperialist
      war. But the soldiers are worn out by  the war, they are
      becoming more and more aware that the war is being fought in the
      interests of the capitalists; the soldiers do not want
      war. Furthermore, the grim  spectre of an appalling debacle, of
      famine and complete economic ruin is advancing upon Russia and
      other  countries.
    
 

The Petrograd Soviet has also got into a blind alley by entering
      into an agreement with the Provisional Government, by supporting
      it, by supporting the loan, and, consequently, supporting the
      war. The Soviet is responsible for the Provisional Government,
      and, seeing no way out of the situation, has also got itself
      into a muddle through  this agreement with the capitalist
      government.
    

At this great historic moment, when the future of the
      revolution is at stake, when the capitalists are torn between
      despair and the thought of shooting down workers, our Party
      appeals to the people, saying in its Conference resolutions:
    

We must understand which  classes  are the motive force
      of the revolution. Their various aspirations must be soberly
      assessed. The capitalist cannot travel the same road as the
      worker. Petty proprietors can neither fully trust the
      capitalists nor all immediately agree on a close fraternal
      alliance with the workers. Only when we understand the
      difference between these classes shall we be able to find the
      correct road for the revolution.
    

The decisions of our Conference on all the basic issues of the
      people’s life draw a clear line between the interests  of the
      different classes and show that it is absolutely impossible to
      find a way out of  the deadlock unless the policy of  trust in
      and support of the capitalist government is abandoned.
    

The situation is one of unparalleled difficulty. There  is one
      way out and only one—the transfer of all state power to the
      Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other Deputies
      throughout Russia, from the bottom up. Only  if state power
      passes to the working class supported by most of the peasantry,
      will it be possible to count on speedily regaining the
      confidence of the workers of other countries, to count on a
      mighty European revolution that will throw off the yoke of
      Capital and put an end to the criminal blood shed in which the
      peoples are embroiled. Only if the power passes to the working
      class supported by most of the peasants shall we  be able to
      cherish the firm hope that the working  people will show
      complete confidence in that power and all, without exception,
      work selflessly to bring about a transformation of the entire
      way of life of the people in the

    

interests of those who labour
      and not in the interests of the capitalists and
      landowners. Without such selfless work, with out a gigantic
      effort on the part of each and every individual, without
      firmness and the determination to rebuild life in a  new way,
      without the strict organisation and comradely discipline of all
      workers and all poor peasants—without  all this there
      is no way out.


The war has brought all mankind to the brink of destruction. The
      capitalists  have become deeply involved in the  war and are
      unable to extricate themselves. The whole  world faces disaster.
    

Workers, comrades! The time is drawing near when events  will
      demand new and still greater heroism—the heroism of
      millions and tens of millions—than you displayed in the
      glorious days of the revolution of February and March. Prepare
      yourselves.
    

Prepare yourselves and remember that  if, together with the
      capitalists, you were able to achieve victory in a few days by a
      simple outburst of popular wrath, you will need more than that
      for victory against the capitalists, for victory over the
      capitalists. To achieve such a victory, to have the workers and
      poor peasants take the power, keep that power  and make proper
      use of  it, you will need organisation, organisation, and
      organisation.
    

Our Party is helping you as much as it can, primarily by
      bringing home to you the different positions of the  different
      classes and their different strength. The decisions of  our
      Conference are devoted to this, and unless you realise this
      clearly, organisation does not mean anything. And  without
      organisation action by the millions is impossible, success is
      impossible.
    

Don’t put your trust in words. Don’t be misled by
      promises. Don’t overestimate your strength. Organise at every
      factory, in every regiment and every company, in every
      residential block. Work at your organising every day, every
      hour; do that work yourselves, for this is something you cannot
      entrust to anybody else. Work to steadily,  soundly and
      indestructibly build up full confidence in the advanced workers
      on the part of the masses.  Such is the main content of all the
      decisions of our Conference. Such is the main lesson taught by
      the entire

    

development of the revolution. Such is the one
      guarantee of success.
    

Workers, comrades! We call upon you to carry out the hard,
      serious, untiring work of consolidating the class-conscious,
      revolutionary proletariat of all countries. This is the one and
      only way out, the only way to save mankind from the horrors of
      war and the yoke of Capital.

The capitalists either sneer at the fraternisation of the
      soldiers at the front or savagely attack it. By lies and slander
      they try to make out that the whole thing is “deception” of the
      Russians by the Germans, and threaten—through
      their  generals and officers—punishment for
      fraternisation.


From the point of view of safeguarding the “sacred right of
      property” in capital and the profits on capital, such a policy
      of the capitalists is quite correct. Indeed, if the proletarian
      socialist revolution is to be  suppressed  at its
      inception it is  essential  that fraternisation be
      regarded the way the capitalists regard it.


The class-conscious workers, followed by the mass of
      semi-proletarians and poor peasants guided by the true instinct
      of oppressed classes, regard fraternisation with pro found
      sympathy. Clearly, fraternisation is a path to peace. Clearly,
      this path does not run through the capitalist governments,
      through an alliance with them, but runs  against
      them. Clearly, this path tends to develop, strengthen, and
      consolidate fraternal confidence between the workers of
      different countries. Clearly, this path is  beginning to
      wreck  the hateful discipline of the barrack prisons, the
      discipline of blind obedience of the soldier to “his” officers
      and generals, to his capitalists (for most of the officers and
      generals either belong to the capitalist class or protect its
      interests). Clearly, fraternisation is the revolutionary
      initiative of the  masses,  it is the awakening of the
      conscience, the mind, the courage of the oppressed classes; in
      other words, it is a rung in the ladder leading up to the
      socialist proletarian revolution.


Long live fraternisation! Long live the  rising
      world-wide socialist revolution of the proletariat!

 

In order that fraternisation achieve the goal we set it more
      easily, surely and rapidly, we must see to it that it is well
      organised and has a clear political programme.


However much the enraged press of the capitalists and their
      friends may slander us, calling us anarchists, we shall never
      tire of repeating: we are not anarchists, we are ardent
      advocates of the best possible organisation of the masses and
      the firmest “state” power—only the state we want is not a
      bourgeois parliamentary republic, but a republic of Soviets of
      Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.


We have always recommended that fraternisation be conducted in
      the most organised manner, taking care—with the help of the
      intelligence, experience and observation of the soldiers
      themselves—that there should be no catch in it, and that
      the officers and generals, who for the most part spread vicious
      slander against fraternisation, be kept away from the meetings.


Our aim is not to have fraternisation confine itself to talk
      about peace in general, but pass on to a discussion of a
      clear  political programme, to a discussion of
      how  to end the war,  how to throw off the
      yoke of the capitalists, who started this war and  are now
      dragging it out.


Our Party has therefore issued an appeal to
      the soldiers of all the belligerent countries (for the text
      of which see  Pravda
No. 37),[1]

which gives a definite
      and precise answer to these questions and a clear political
      programme.


It is a good thing that the soldiers are cursing the war. It is
      a good thing that they are demanding peace. It is a good thing
      that they are beginning to realise that the war is advantageous
      to the capitalists. It is a good thing that they are wrecking
      the harsh discipline and beginning to fraternise on all the
      fronts. All this is good.


But it is not enough.


The soldiers must now pass to a form of fraternisation in which
      a clear political programme is discussed. We are not
      anarchists. We do not think that the war can be ended by a
      simple ’refusal”, a refusal of individuals, groups or casual
      “crowds”. We are for the war being ended, as it will be, by a
      revolution in a number of countries, i.e., by the
      conquest

    

of state power by a new class, not the
      capitalists, not the small proprietors (who are always
      half-dependent on the capitalists), but by the proletarians and
      semi-proletarians.


And so, in our appeal to the soldiers of all the belligerent
      countries we have set forth our programme for a workers’
      revolution in all countries, namely, the transfer of all state
      power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.


Comrades, soldiers, discuss this programme among yourselves and
      with the  German soldiers. Such a discussion will  help you to
      find the true path, the most organised and  shortest path, to
      end the war and overthrow the yoke of  Capital.


 *     *  * 
A word about one of the servants of Capital, Plekhanov. It is
      pitiful to see how low this former socialist has sunk! He
      compares fraternisation to “treachery”! His argument is: will
      not fraternisation, if it succeeds, lead to a separate peace?


No, Mr. ex-socialist, fraternisation, which we have supported on
      all  the fronts, will not lead to a “separate” peace
      between the capitalists of several countries, but to a universal
      peace between the revolutionary workers of all countries,
      despite the capitalists of all countries,
      against  the capitalists, and for the overthrow of
      their yoke.

We have received the following telegram:



      “Yeniseisk. The Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies has taken cognisance of Minister Lvov’s telegram to the
      appointed Commissar of Yeniseisk Gubornia, Krutovsky, sent to
      Yeniseisk for guidance.


      “We protest against the intention to reintroduce a
      bureaucracy. We declare, first, that we will not stand for being
      ruled by appointed officials. Second, there can be no return for
      officials who have been driven out by the peasants. Third, we
      recognise only such local bodies as have been set up in
      Yeniseisk Uyezd by the people themselves. Fourth, appointed
      officials can rule here only over our dead bodies.


      “Yeniseisk Soviet of Deputies”



And so the Provisional Government appoints “commissars” from
      Petrograd to “direct” the activities of the Yeniseisk Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, or the Yeniseisk organ of
      self-government. What is more, this appointment is  made in such
      a form as to evoke the protest of the Yeniseisk  Soviet against
      “the intention to reintroduce a bureaucracy”.


Moreover, the Yeniseisk Soviet  declares that “appointed
      officials can rule here only over our dead bodies”. The
      behaviour of the Provisional Government has brought this  remote
      uyezd in Siberia, as represented by its popularly
      elected governing body, to a point when a direct threat of
      armed resistance is made against the Provisional
      Government.


The Provisional Government bosses have certainly asked  for it!


Yet they will go on thundering  denunciations against those
      mischievous people who “preach” “civil war”!


What was the idea of appointing “commissars” from Petrograd or
      from any other centre to “direct” the activities of  the
      elected local body? Are we to believe that a man from

    

outside is more familiar with local needs, more capable of
      “directing” the local population? What cause did the people of
      Yeniseisk give for such an absurd measure? Even  if
      the people of Yeniseisk did run counter to the decisions of a
      majority of citizens in other localities, would it not have been
      better to try, for a start, to obtain some information
      instead of giving occasion for talk about “bureaucracy”, and
      provoking legitimate dissatisfaction and resentment on the part
      of the local population?


To all these questions there can be only one answer. The
      representatives of the landowners and capitalists sitting in the
      Provisional Government are determined to preserve  the
      old tsarist  machinery  of government: officials
      “appointed” from above. That is what all bourgeois parliamentary
      republics in the world have nearly always been doing, except for
      brief periods of revolution in some countries. That is what was
      done to prepare the ground for the return  from  a
      republic to a monarchy, for a return to the Napoleons, to the
      military dictators. And that is what the Cadets are bent on
      doing when they copy those unhappy examples.


This is a very serious matter. We should not deceive
      ourselves. By such measures the Provisional Government, whether
      it means to or not, is  preparing the ground  for a
      restoration of the monarchy in Russia.


The entire responsibility for any possible—and to a certain
      extent inevitable—attempt to restore the monarchy in Russia
      rests with the Provisional Government, which is undertaking such
      counter-revolutionary measures. Officials “appointed” from above
      to “direct” the local population have always been a sure step
      towards the restoration of the monarchy, in the same way as the
      standing army and the police.


The Yeniseisk Soviet is a thousand times right, both practically
      and in principle. The return of local officials who have been
      driven out by the peasants should not be allowed. The
      introduction of “appointed” officials should not be
      tolerated. Only such bodies in the local areas should be
      recognised as have been set up by the people themselves.


The idea of “direction” by officials “appointed” from above is
      essentially false and undemocratic, it is Caesarism, Blanquist
      adventurism. Engels was quite right when, in
      criticising

    

in 1891 the draft programme of the German
      Social-Democrats who were badly Infected with bureaucratism, he
      pressed the demand for no supervision from above over local
      self-government. Engels was right when he quoted the experience
      of France, which, governed between 1792 and 1798 by local
      elective bodies without any supervision from above, did not
      “fall apart”, did not “disintegrate”, but, on the contrary,
      gained strength, became democratically consolidated and
      organised.[1]


Foolish bureaucratic prejudices, tsarist red-tapism, reactionary
      professorial ideas as to the indispensability of bureaucratism,
      the counter-revolutionary tendencies and attempts of the
      landowners and capitalists—this is the soil which nourishes
      such measures of the Provisional Government as we have been
      discussing.


The healthy democratic feeling of the workers and peasants,
      roused by the insulting attempt of the Provisional Government to
      “appoint” officials from above to “direct” the activities of the
      adult local population, the overwhelming majority, who had
      elected their own representatives—this is what the
      Yeniseisk Soviet has revealed.


What the people need is a really democratic, workers’ and
      peasants’ republic, whose authorities have been elected by the
      people and are displaceable by the people any time they may wish
      it. And it is for  such  a republic that the  workers
      and peasants should fight, resisting all attempts  of the
      Provisional Government to restore the monarchist, tsarist
      methods and machinery of government.

By betraying socialism and going over to the side of “their own”
      capitalists, the social-chauvinists
      have naturally split up in conformity with the capitalist
      groupings in the war. The split itself, just as naturally, is a
      temporary one. Plekhanov refuses to confer with Scheidemann, but
      that does not prevent him from defending the “International” of
      the social-chauvinists, which has betrayed socialism. In other
      words, Plekhanov is for a split with the Scheidemanns
      during the time  the capitalists, whose agents they
      both are, are split up among themselves. Plekhanov is for unity
      with the Scheidemanns when the “masters” (i.e., the capitalists
      of both countries) are reconciled. There is no denying a certain
      consistency in Plekhanov’s position—the consistency of
      betrayal  of socialism, the consistency of willing and
      faithful service to the capitalists.


No wonder the representatives of the international socialist
      “Centre” (Kautsky and others), being as they are in favour of
      “unity” with the social-chauvinists in general, agree to the
      conference organised by that agent of
      Scheidemann—Brogbjerg, or themselves organise (like the
      Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet) an international
      “socialist” conference  together with  the Scheidemanns
      and Plekhanovs. No wonder our Russian representatives of the
      “Centre”, through their mouthpiece  Rabochaya Gazeta,
      are so angered at our Party’s refusal to attend Borgbjerg’s
      conference.


Yesterday evening we received a telegram from our Stockholm
      correspondent:


      “Haase, Longuet attending conference. ‘Spartacus’
      refused.”


The name "Spartacus"
      or “Internationale” is used in Germany for the group to which Karl
      Liebknecht belongs.

    

    
There has been a great hullabaloo lately, raised by people who
      are particularly interested in upsetting the apple-cart,  about
      the Liebknecht group having supposedly united with  the
      Kautskyites in a new Independent
      Social-Democratic  Party of
Germany.[1] As a matter  of fact,
      the Liebknecht group is only affiliated to the Kautskyites as an
      independent organisation and merely entered into a temporary and
      qualified bloc against the social-chauvinists.


The telegram quoted above is one more confirmation of this fact,
      When things came to a practical point and a clear and definite
      answer had to be given immediately on the  question of making
      common cause with Scheidemann and his agents, the alliance
      between Liebknecht’s group and the  Kautsky group  crumbled
      at once.


Some comrades feared that our resolution concerning Borgbjerg
      would “isolate” us.


No, comrades! It isolates us from the waverers. There
      is  only one way of helping waverers, and that is by ceasing to
      be a waverer yourself.


The correctness of our resolution against Borgbjerg has been
      strikingly, fully and speedily confirmed by events. The
      Kautskyites of Germany (Haase) and France (Longuet) are still
      wavering. They have agreed to confer with the social-
      chauvinists and cannot make up their minds to dissociate
      themselves from them.


In taking upon itself the initiative in bringing about such a
      cleavage, our Party  has already started  to rally the
      elements of a Third International. The fact that our tactics
      coincide with those of the Liebknecht group is no accident. It
      is a step towards the inchoate Third International.

All the papers have published, in full or in part, the speech
      which I.
      G. Tsereteli delivered on April 27 at the ceremonial session
      of the deputies of all the Dumas, past and present.


It was quite a ministerial speech. The speech of a minister
      without a portfolio. Still, we think there is no harm,
      even  when ministers without portfolios make
      ministerial speeches, in sparing a thought for socialism,
      Marxism and the class struggle. To each his own. It behooves the
      bourgeoisie to shun all talk about the class struggle, to avoid
      analysing it, studying it, and making it a basis for determining
      policies. It behooves the bourgeoisie to dismiss these
      “disagreeable” and “tactless” subjects—as they say in
      parlours—and to sing the praises of “unity” of “all friends
      of freedom”. It behooves the proletarian party not to forget the
      class struggle.


To each his own.


Two basic political ideas underlie I. G. Tsereteli’s
      speech. First, that a line can and should be drawn between two
      “sections” of the bourgeoisie. One section “has come to an
      agreement with the democrats”; the position of this bourgeoisie
      insecure. The other consists of “irresponsible elements of the
      bourgeoisie who are provoking civil war”, or, as Tsereteli
      describes them, “many people from among the moderate elements of
      the property-owners”.


The speaker’s second political idea is this: “Any attempt right
      now to proclaim [!?] the dictatorship of the proletariat and the
      peasantry” would be a “desperate” attempt, and he, Tsereteli,
      would agree to such a desperate attempt only if he could believe
      for one minute that Shulgin’s ideas were really “shared by  all
      the property-owning bourgeoisie”.


Let us examine these two political ideas of I. G. Tsereteli,
      who, as befits a minister without a portfolio or a candidate

    

for
      the ministry, has taken a middle-of-the-road stand—neither
      for reaction nor for revolution, neither with Shulgin  nor with
      the adherents of ’desperate attempts”.


What class distinctions between the two indicated sections  of
      the bourgeoisie did Tsereteli make? None at all. It did not
      even occur to Tsereteli that there would be no harm in shaping
      policies on the basis of the class struggle. Both “Sections” of
      the bourgeoisie, in class substance, are landowners and
      capitalists. Tsereteli did not mention a word about Shulgin
      not representing the same classes or sub-classes as
      Guchkov represents—the latter a member of the Provisional
      Government and  an important one  at that. Tsereteli singles out
      the ideas  of Shulgin from those of the “entire” property-owning
      bourgeoisie, but gives no reasons for doing so. Nor
      could he give any. Shulgin stands for the undivided power of the
      Provisional Government; he is against supervision of that
      government by the armed soldiers; he is against “anti-British
      propaganda”, against the soldiers being “set on” the “officer
      class”, against the propaganda of Petrogradskaya
      Storona, [2] etc. These ideas are to be found every day in the
      columns of Rech, in the speeches and manifestos of the
      ministers with portfolios, etc.


The only difference is that Shulgin speaks more “glibly”, while
      the Provisional Government, being a government,  speaks
      more discreetly; Shulgin speaks in a deep voice, Milyukov in a
      falsetto. Milyukov is  for an agreement with  the Soviet, and
      Shulgin, too, has  nothing against  such an
      agreement. Both Shulgin and Milyukov are for “other methods of
      control” (not control by armed soldiers).


Tsereteli has thrown overboard all ideas of the class
      struggle. He has made  no  mention of class
      distinctions or any serious political distinctions between “the
      two sections” of the bourgeoisie, nor did he think of mentioning
      them.


By “democrats”, referred to in his speech. Tsereteli meant  “the
      proletariat and the revolutionary peasantry”. Let us  examine
      this class definition. The bourgeoisie has entered into an
      agreement with these democrats. One is entitled to  ask, what
      forms the basis  of this agreement, by what
      class interests is it upheld?


Not a word  about this in Tsereteli’s speech. All he speaks
      about is a “common democratic platform which has now

    

proved
      acceptable to the whole country”, i.e., evidently to the
      proletarians and the peasants, since the “country” is really the
      workers and peasants minus the property-owners.


Does this platform exclude, say, the question of the land? It
      does not. The platform side-steps it. Do class interests and
      their conflicts disappear by being side-stepped in  diplomatic
      documents, deeds of “agreement”, and the  speeches and
      statements of ministers?


Tsereteli “forgot” to  raise this question, forgot a “trivial
      detail”—he “merely” forgot the class interests and the
      class struggle....


      “All the problems of the Russian revolution,” expatiates
      I. G. Tsereteli, “the very crux of it [!?] depend on whether
      the propertied classes [i.e., the landowners and capitalists]
      will understand that this is a national platform and not a
      specially proletarian platform.”


Poor landowners and capitalists! They are so slow-witted.  They
      “do not understand”. They need a special minister of the
      democracy to teach them what’s what.


Maybe this spokesman of the “democrats” has forgotten the class
      struggle, has adopted the stand of Louis Blanc, and is
      dismissing the conflict of class interests with mere phrases?


Is  it Shulgin and Guchkov with Milyukov who “do not
      understand” that the peasant  can be reconciled with
      the  landowner on a platform that side-steps the land question?
      Or is it I. G. Tsereteli who “does not understand” that this
      cannot  be done?


The workers and peasants must confine themselves to what  is
      “acceptable” to the landowners and capitalists—that is the
      real gist (the class, not the verbal, gist) of the Shulgin
      Milyukov-Plekhanov position.  And they “understand” it better
      than Tsereteli does.


This brings us to Tsereteli’s second political idea—that
      the  dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry (a
      dictator ship, by the way, is won, not “proclaimed”) would be a
      desperate attempt. In the first place, to speak so simply of
      this dictatorship nowadays  is likely to land Tsereteli in  the
      archives of the “old
Bolsheviks”.[1]

Secondly, and most

    

important of all, the workers and peasants
      constitute the vast majority of the population. And does not
      “democracy” mean carrying out the will of the majority?
    

How then can one be a democrat, and yet be  opposed  to
      the “dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry”? flow
      can one fear “civil war” from it? (What kind of civil  war?

    
That  of a handful  of landowners and capitalists
      against the workers and peasants? That of an
      insignificant minority against an overwhelming majority?)


I.  G. Tsereteli is hopelessly muddled.  He has even forgotten
      that Lvov and Co. carry out their promise to convene the
      Constituent Assembly, the latter would become a “dictatorship”
      of the  majority. Or must the workers and peasants, even in the
      Constituent Assembly, confine them selves to what is
      “acceptable” to the landowners and the  capitalists?


The workers and peasants are the vast majority. All power  to
      this majority is, if you please, a “desperate attempt”....


Tsereteli is in a muddle because he has completely over looked
      the class struggle. lie has abandoned the standpoint of  Marxism
      for that of Louis Blanc, who talked himself out of  the class
      struggle.


The task of a proletarian leader is to clarify the difference in
      class interests and persuade certain sections of the petty
      bourgeoisie (namely, the poor peasants) to choose between  the
      workers and the capitalists, to take sides with the workers.


The task of petty-bourgeois Louis Blancs is to play down  the
      difference in class interests and persuade certain sections  of
      the bourgeoisie (mainly the intellectuals and parliamentarians)
      to “agree” with the workers, to persuade the workers to “agree”
      with the capitalists, and the peasants to “agree” with the
      landowners.


Louis Blanc tried hard to persuade the Paris bourgeoisie, and,
      as we know, all but persuaded it to refrain from the mass
      shootings of 1848 and 1871.

In connection with the report that several ex-ministers had
      accepted directorships of big banks,  Pravda asked:


      “In how many banks do the present ministers, Guchkov,
      Tereshchenko, and Konovalov—have an interest (in the
      capacity of directors, shareholders, or actual owners)?”


And added:


      “Our comrades, the bank employees (who, by the way,  should
      organise a union of their own as  soon as possible), would do
      well to gather material on this subject and publish it in the
      labour
press.”[1]


Alarmed by  this, Birzheviye Vedomosti,  a paper which,
      as we know, savours strongly of banks, writes:


“The ‘comrades employees’ are asked to organise a
      detective service, to rummage about in the tills of the
      bourgeois ministers for the purpose of checking the cash in
      them. With the same effrontery the Bolsheviks are rummaging
      about in other people’s convictions. May we not soon see
      Pravda  advising the comrades to set up a secret police
      department of their own. Room for it will be found in the
      Kshesinskaya mansion....”



Why are the gentlemen from  Birzheviye Vedomosti so
      perturbed?


What has “detective service” got to do with it, gentlemen?


We have nothing whatever against the bank employees publishing
      lists of bank bosses of  all parties. Why,

    

gentlemen,
      shouldn’t the people have a right to know who are the chief
      owners of such institutions as the banks—those powerful
      institutions on which the country’s whole economic life depends,
      and which have such a say in deciding the. issues of war and
      peace?


What are you afraid of, gentlemen?

The whole of Russia remembers the days of April 19–21, when
      civil war was about to break out in the streets of Petrograd.
    

On April 21 the Provisional Government penned a new reassuring
missive[1]
      purporting to “explain” its predatory Note of the 18th.
    

After this the majority of the Executive Committee of the Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies decided to consider the
      “incident settled”.
    

Another couple of days passed, and the question of a coalition
      cabinet cropped up. The Executive Committee was almost
      equally divided: 23 against a coalition cabinet, 22 for it. The
      incident had been “settled” only on paper.
    

Two more days passed, and we now have another “incident”. War
      Minister Guchkov, one of the leaders of the Provisional
      Government, has resigned. There is talk of the whole Provisional
      Government having decided to resign. (At the time of writing, we
      still do not know for certain whether the government has
      resigned.) A new “incident” has occurred one that throws all
      previous “incidents” into the shade.
    

Whence this spate of “incidents”? Is there no root cause which
      inevitably engenders “incident” upon  “incident”?
    

There is  such a cause. It is what we know as the dual
      power, that state of unstable equilibrium resulting from the
      agreement between the Soviet and the Provisional Government.
    

The Provisional Government is a government of the
      capitalists. It cannot give up its dreams of conquests
      (annexations),  it cannot end the predatory war by a democratic
      peace,  it cannot but protect the profits of its own class (the
      capitalist

    

class), it cannot but protect the estates of the
      land owners.
    

The Soviet represents other classes. Most of the workers  and
      soldiers in the Soviet do not want this predatory war, they  are
      not interested in the profits  of the capitalists or  in
      preserving the privileges of the landowners. At the same time,
      however, they still have faith in the Provisional Government of
      the capitalists, they are for having agreements with it, for
      keeping in contact with it.
    

The Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies are them selves a
      government in embryo. On some questions they attempt to exercise
      power parallel with the Provisional  Government. We thus have an
      overlapping of power, or, as it is now called, a “crisis of
      power”.
    

This cannot go on for long. Such a state of affairs is bound
      every day to cause new “incidents” and fresh complications. It
      is easy enough to inscribe on a bit of paper “the incident is
      settled”. In real life, however, these incidents do not
      disappear. And this for the simple reason that they are not
      “incidents” at all, they are not chance happenings, not
      trifles. They are the outward signs of a deep-rooted inner
      crisis. They are a result of the impasse in which humanity now
      finds itself. There can be no way out of this predatory war
      unless we accept the measures proposed by the internationalist
      socialists.
    

The Russian people are offered three ways of ending this “crisis
      of power”. Some say: Leave things as they are, put  still
      greater trust in the Provisional Government. The threat to
      resign may  be a trick calculated to make the  Soviet  say: We
      trust  you still more. The Provisional Government wants the
      Soviet to beg it: Come and rule over us; what shall we do
      without you....
    

Others propose a coalition cabinet. Let us  share the
      ministerial portfolios with Milyukov and Co., they say, let us
      get some of our own people into the cabinet; it will be quite
      another pair of shoes then.
    

We propose a third way: A complete change of the Soviets’
      policy, no confidence in the capitalists, and the transfer
      of all power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies. A change of personalities will give
      nothing; the whole policy must be changed. Another
      class must  assume power.

    

    
A government of workers and soldiers would be trusted by the
      whole world, for everyone knows that a worker and a poor peasant
      would want to rob no one. Only this can put a speedy end to the
      war, only this can help us through the economic debacle.
    

All power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies!
      No confidence in the government the capitalists!


Every “incident”, every day, every hour will confirm the
      soundness  of this watchword.

## Finland and Russia

Finland’s attitude to Russia has become the topic of the
      day. The Provisional Government has  failed  to meet
      the demand of the Finnish people, which,  so far, is
      not for secession, but only for broad autonomy.
    

The Provisional Government’s undemocratic, annexationist policy
      was formulated and “defended” the other day by  Rabochaya
      Gazeta.  It could not have made a more “damning” defence
      than it did. This is indeed a fundamental issue, an  issue of
      state significance, which deserves the closest attention.
    


      “The Organising Committee believes,” writes Rabochaya
      Gazeta No. 42, “that the general problem of Finnish-Russian
      relations can and should be settled only by an agreement between
      the Finnish Diet and the Constituent Assembly. Pending this the
      Finnish comrades [the Organising Committee has had talks  with
      the Finnish Social-Democrats] should bear in mind that if
      separate tendencies in Finland were to increase, this would be
      likely to strengthen the centralist
      tendencies  of the Russian bourgeoisie.”
    


That is the point of view of the capitalists, the bourgeoisie,
      the Cadets, but not of the proletariat. The programme of  the
      Social-Democratic Party, namely,  9, which recognises  the
      right of self-determination for all nation members of the state,
      has been thrown overboard by the Menshevik
      Social-Democrats. They have, in effect, renounced this programme
      and taken sides with the bourgeoisie, just as they did on the
      question of the replacement of the standing army by the
      universally armed people, and so on.
    

The capitalists, the bourgeoisie, including the Cadet Party,
      never did recognise the right of nations to political
      self-determination, i.e., freedom to secede from
      Russia.
    
 

The Social-Democratic Party recognised this right in
      § 9 of  its programme, adopted in 1903.
    

When the Organising Committee “recommended” to the  Finnish
      Social-Democrats an ’agreement’ between the Finnish Diet and the
      Constituent Assembly, they were, on this question, taking sides
      with the bourgeoisie. One merely has to compare the positions of
      all  the principal classes and  parties to see the
      truth of this.
    

The tsar, the Rights, the monarchists are not for an agreement
      between the Diet and the Constituent Assembly—they are for
      subjecting Finland to the Russian nation. The republican
      bourgeoisie are for an agreement between the Finnish
      Diet and the Constituent Assembly. The class-conscious
      proletariat and the Social-Democrats, true  to their
      programme, are for the  right  of Finland, as of all
      the other  underprivileged nations, to secede from
      Russia. We have here  a clear, precise, and indisputable
      picture. Under the guise of an agreement”, which cannot settle
      anything—for what are  you going to do if an agreement is
      not  reached?—the bourgeoisie is pursuing the same
      old tsarist policy of subjection  and annexation.
    

For Finland was annexed by the Russian tsars as the result of a
      deal with the suppressor of the French revolution, Napoleon,
      etc. If we are really against annexations, we should  say:
      give Finland the right of secession! Not until this
      has been said and accomplished can an “agreement” with Finland
      be a really free and voluntary agreement, a real  agreement, and
      not just a fake.
    

Agreement is possible only between equals. If the agreement is
      to be a real agreement, and not a verbal screen for subjection,
      both  parties to  it must enjoy real equality of
      status, that is to say, both Russia and Finland must
      have the right to disagree.  That is as clear as
      daylight.
    

Only by “freedom of secession” can that right be expressed. Only
      when she is free to secede will Finland really be in a position
      to enter into an “agreement” with Russia as to  whether she
      should secede or not.  Without this condition,  without
      recognising the right of secession, all phrase-mongering about
      an “agreement” is self-deception and deception of the people.
    

The Organising Committee should have told the Finns

    

plainly
      whether it recognises the right of secession or not.  It
      befogged the issue, like the Cadets, and thereby repudiated the
      right of secession. It should have attacked the Russian
      bourgeoisie for denying the oppressed nations the right to
      secede, a denial which is  tantamount to annexation.
      Instead,  the Organising Committee attacks the Finns and warns
      them  that “separate” (they should have said separatist)
      tendencies  would strengthen centralist inclinations! In other
      words, the Organising Committee threatens the Finns with the
      strengthening of the annexationist Great-Russian
      bourgeoisie—just what the Cadets have always done, the very
      guise  under which Rodichev and Co. are pursuing their
      annexationist policy.
    
We have here a clear and practical commentary on the question
      of annexations, which “everybody” is now talking about, though
      afraid to face the issue squarely.  To be against
      the right of secession is to be for annexations.


The tsars pursued a crude policy of annexation, bartering one
      nation for another by agreement with other monarchs  (the
      partition of Poland, the deal with Napoleon over Fin land, and
      so on), just like the landowners, who used to ex  change peasant
      serfs. The bourgeoisie, on turning republican, is carrying on
      the  same  policy of annexation, only more  subtly,
      less openly, by promising an “agreement” while
      taking away the only effective guarantee of real
      equality in the making of an agreement, namely, the right of
      secession. The  Organising Committee is dragging at the tail-end
      of the bourgeoisie, and in practice taking its side.
      (Birzhevka was therefore quite right in reprinting all
      the salient points of the Rabochaya Gazeta  article and
      approving the Organising  Committee’s reply to the Finns. which
      it called a “lesson by Russian democracy” to the
      Finns. Rabochaya Gazeta deserved this kiss from
      Birzhevka.)
    

At its conference, the party of the proletariat (the
      “Bolsheviks”) once more confirmed the right of secession in its
      resolution on the national question.
    

The alignment of classes and parties is clear.
    

The petty bourgeois are letting themselves be frightened by the
      spectre of a frightened bourgeoisie—that is the whole crux
      of the policy of the Menshevik Social-Democrats and the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. They are “afraid” of secession.

    

    
The class-conscious proletarians are not afraid of
      It. Both  Norway and Sweden gained from Norway’s free secession
      from Sweden in 1905: it made for mutual trust between the two
      nations, it drew them closer together on a voluntary  basis, it
      did away with the stupid and destructive friction,  it
      strengthened the economic and political, the cultural and social
      gravitation  of the two nations to each other, and
      strengthened the fraternal alliance  between the workers of the
      two countries.
    

Comrades, workers and peasants, do not be influenced by the
      annexationist policy of the Russian capitalists, Guchkov,
      Milyukov, and the Provisional Government towards Finland,
      Kurland, Ukraine, etc.! Do not fear to recognise the right of
      all these nations to secede! Nations must be won over to the
      idea of an alliance with the Great Russians not by force, but
      by a really voluntary and really free agreement, which is
      impossible  without the right of secession.
    

The freer Russia is, and the more resolutely our republic
      recognises the right of non-Great-Russian nations to secede,
      the more strongly will other nations be  attracted
      towards an alliance with us, the less friction will there be,
      the more rarely will actual secession occur, the shorter the
      period of secession will last, and the closer and more
      enduring—in the  long run—will the fraternal alliance
      be between the Russian proletarian and peasant republic and the
      republics of all other nations.

Yesterday the bourgeois papers again published misinformation
      about my promising to address. A meeting of delegates from the
      front on Sunday, April 30. I gave  no  such
      promise. Owing to illness I  cannot  speak. I would ask
      that  only  information published in  Pravda
      and only statements signed by me should be believed, otherwise
      it will be impossible for me to contend with falsehood,
      inaccuracies and misrepresentation.

That is what the proclamation of the Executive Committee of the
      Petrograd Soviet to the socialists of the world, published in
      today’s papers, amounts to. It has a lot to say against
      imperialism, but all these words are nullified by a single
      little phrase which reads:
    

      “The Provisional Government of revolutionary Russia has adopted
      this platform” (i.e., peace without annexations and indemnities
      on the basis of self-determination of  nations).
    

The gist of the matter is summed up in this one phrase.  This
      phrase is a defence of Russian  imperialism, which it
      cloaks and whitewashes. As a matter of fact, our Provisional
      Government, far from “adopting” a platform of peace without
      annexations, is trampling upon it daily and hourly.
    

Our Provisional Government has “diplomatically”  renounced
      annexations, just as the government of the German capitalists,
      those brigands Wilhelm and Bethmann-Hollweg,  have done. In
      words, both governments have renounced annexations. In practice,
      both  continue the policy of annexations. The German
      capitalist government forcibly holds Belgium, a  part of France,
      Serbia, Montenegro, Rumania, Poland, Danish  provinces, Alsace,
      etc.; the Russian capitalist government holds part of Galicia,
      Turkish Armenia, Finland, Ukraine, etc. The British capitalist
      government is the most annexationist government in the world,
      for it forcibly keeps the  greatest number of nationalities
      within the British Empire:
      India (three hundred million), Ireland, Turkish Mesopotamia, the
      German colonies in Africa, etc.
    
 

The Executive Committee’s proclamation covers up its lies about
      annexations with deceptive phrases, and thereby  does great harm
      to the cause of the proletariat and the  revolution. First of
      all, the proclamation does not differentiate between the
      renunciation of annexations in words (in this sense,
      all  capitalist governments, without exception, have
      “adopted” the “platform of peace without annexations”)  and
      renunciation of annexations in deeds  (in this sense,
      not one capitalist government in the world has
      renounced annexations). Secondly, the proclamation—without
      any  justification, without any basis, contrary to the
      truth—whitewashes the  Russian  Provisional
      Government of the capitalists, which is not a bit better (and,
      probably, not worse) than any other capitalist government.
    

To cloak an unpleasant truth with a deceptive phrase is  most
      harmful and most dangerous to the cause  of the proletariat, to
      the cause of the toiling masses. The truth, however bitter, must
      be faced squarely. A policy that does not meet  this requirement
      is a ruinous policy.
    

And the truth about annexations is that  all
      capitalist governments, the Russian Provisional Government
      included,  are deceiving the people with promises—they
      renounce the  policy of annexations in words, but continue it
      in deeds. Any intelligent person can prove this truth
      for himself by  simply making up a  full list  of the
      annexations of, say,  only three  countries: Germany,
      Russia, and Britain.
    

Just try it, gentlemen!
    

By refusing to do this, by whitewashing one’s own
      government and blackening others, one becomes in effect a
      defender of imperialism.
    

In conclusion we would remark that at the end of the
      proclamation we have another fly in the ointment, namely,  the
      assurance that “whatever the differences that have been  rending
      socialism during the three years of war, no faction of the
      proletariat should decline to participate in the general
      struggle for peace”.
    

This, too, we regret to say, is a deceptive phrase, an utterly
      empty and meaningless one. Plekhanov and Scheidemann both assert
      that they are ’fighting for peace”, a “peace with out
      annexations” at that. But it is clear to everyone that they are
      both fighting to defend each his own imperialist

    

government of
      the capitalists. What good do we do the cause of the working
      classes by uttering sugar-coated lies, by  playing down the fact
      that the Plekhanovs and the Scheidemauns have gone over to the
      side of their  respective capitalists? Is it not
      obvious that such glossing over of the truth amounts to
      whitewashing imperialism and its defenders?

The appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to the army published  in
      yesterday’s papers  is a  further defection of the Soviet’s
      leaders, the Narodniks and Mensheviks, to the side of the
      Russian Imperialist bourgeoisie.
    

The incoherency of thought revealed by this appeal is
      astonishing. Only people whose heads are hopelessly stuffed
      with “revolutionary” phrases can fail to see this.
    


      “The working people had no need for the war. They did not start
      it. It was started by the tsars and the capitalists of all
      countries.”
    


Quite right. So far so good. And when the appeal “calls upon the
      workers and peasants of Germany and Austria-Hungary to rise,
      and make a revolution”, we approve whole heartedly, for this is
      a correct slogan.
    

But how, with this indubitable truth, can one utter in the same
      breath the following  flagrant untruth:
    


      “You [Russian soldiers] are staunchly defending not the tsar,
      not  the Protopopovs and the Rasputins, not the rich
      landowners and capitalists...”
    


The words we have italicised are a patent and flagrant  untruth.
    

If the working masses “have no need” for the war, if the  war
      was started not only  by the tsars, but by “the
      capitalists of  all countries” (as  was definitely
      stated in the appeal issued  by the Soviet), then, obviously,
      any nation involved in this war who tolerates a government of
      the capitalists is  actually “defending” the
      capitalists.
    

One or the other: either  the Austrian and German
      capitalists alone are to “blame” for this war; if this is what
      the  Narodnik and Menshevik leaders of the Petrograd Soviet
      think, then they are sinking to the level of Plekhanov, the

    

Russian Scheidemann—in that case, the words saying that
      the war was “started by the capitalists of all countries” should
      be erased as being untrue; in that case, the slogan  “peace
      without annexations” should be thrown overboard as  being
      untrue, because the appropriate slogan for such a policy would
      be: take the annexed territories away from the Germans, but keep
      (and extend) the territories annexed by the  British and the
      Russians.
    

Or this war was really started by “the capitalists of
      all  countries”;  if the Narodnik and Menshevik leaders of the
      Soviet do not deny this unquestionable truth, then all
      the more revolting is the lie that the Russian soldiers, so long
      as they put up with their capitalist government, are “not”
      defending the capitalists.
    

In that case the Russian soldiers too (and not only the
      Austrian and the German) should be told the truth. Comrade
      soldiers, we should say to them, so long as we put up with our
      capitalist government, so long as the tsar’s secret treaties are
      considered a holy of holies, we are carrying on an imperialist
      war of conquest, we are defending predatory treaties
      concluded by ex-Tsar Nicholas with the Anglo-French capitalists.
    

That is a bitter truth. But it is the truth. The people should
      be told the truth. Only then will their eyes be opened and they
      will learn to fight against untruth.
    

Look at this matter from another angle, and you will  convince
      yourselves once more of the utter untruthfulness  of the
      Soviet’s appeal. It calls  upon the German workers and peasants
      to “rise”. Very well. But to rise  against  whom? Is it
      only against Wilhelm?
    

Imagine Wilhelm replaced by the German Guchkovs and Milyukovs,
      i.e., by the representatives of the German capitalist
      class—would this alter the predatory character of the  war
      as far as Germany is concerned? Obviously, it would
      not. Everyone knows—and  the Soviet’s appeal admits
      it—that the war was “started by the tsars  and the
      capitalists of all countries”. Consequently, the overthrow
      of tsars, with power passing to the capitalists, alters nothing
      whatever as far as the nature of the war is concerned. The
      annexation of Belgium, Serbia, etc., will not cease being
      annexation if  the German Cadets take the place of Wilhelm, just
      as the

    

annexation of Khiva, Bokhara, Armenia, Finland, Ukraine,
      etc.,  has not ceased being annexation because the Russian
      Cadets, the Russian capitalists, have taken the place of
      Nicholas.
    

And finally, let us assume that the Soviet’s appeal calls  upon
      the German workers and peasants to rise not only  against
      Wilhelm but also against the German capitalists.  We should then
      say that the appeal is correct and sound. We  fully support
      it. But then we should ask our esteemed fellow  citizens,
      Chernov, Chkheidze, and Tsereteli: Is it right, is it
      reasonable, is it seemly to call upon the Germans to rise
      against their capitalists, while you yourselves are
      supporting the capitalist government at home?


Aren’t you afraid, my dear fellow-citizens, that the German
      workers will accuse you of mendacity or even (God forbid) of
      hypocrisy?
    

Aren’t you afraid that the German workers will turn round and
      say: Our revolution has not broken out yet, we have not yet
      reached the point where our Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies can openly make arrangements with the capitalists in
      the matter of power. If you, our Russian brothers,  have already
      come to this, then why do you preach “revolt”  to us (a thing
      that is painful, bloody, and difficult), while you yourselves
      refuse to take over power peacefully from Lvov and Co.,
      who have expressed their willingness to relinquish it? You speak
      about the revolution in Russia, but, Citizens  Chernov,
      Chkheidze, and Tsereteli, you have all studied socialism, and
      you realise only too well that  so jar your revolution
      has only put the capitalists  in power. Is it not
      trebly  insincere, when, in the name of the Russian revolution,
      which has given power to the Russian imperialist capitalists,
      you  demand of us, Germans, a revolution against the German
      imperialist capitalists? Does It not look as if your
      “internationalism”, your “revolutionism” are for foreign
      consumption only; as if revolution against the capitalists is
      only for the  Germans, while for the Russians (despite the
      seething revolution in Russia) it is agreement  with
      the capitalists?
    

Chernov, Chkheidze, and Tsereteli have sunk completely  to the
      level of defending Russian imperialism.
    

It is a deplorable fact, but a fact nevertheless.

The capitalist newspapers, led by Rech, are falling
    over backwards in their attempt to scare the people with the
    spectre of “anarchy”. Not a day passes without Rech
    screaming about anarchy, whipping up rumours and reports of casual
    and minor breaches of the law, and frightening the people with the
    spectre of a frightened bourgeoisie.
    

In the wake of the Rech and of the capitalist papers
      comes the press of the Narodniks (including the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries) and the Mensheviks. They, too, have
      allowed themselves to be frightened. The editorial in today’s
      Izcestia of the Petrograd Soviet, whose leaders are all
      members of these parties, shows this paper to have definitely
      taken sides wit the peddlers of “bourgeois terrors”. It has
      talked itself into a statement, which , to put it mildly, is
      grossly exaggerating:
    


      “There is demoralisation in the army. In some places there is
      disorderly seizure of the land, and destruction and looting of
      livestock and farm implements. Arbitrary action is on the
      increase.”


By arbitrary action the Narodniks and Mensheviks, that is, the
      parties of the petty bourgeoisie, mean, among other things, the
      seizure by the peasants in the local areas of all the land
      without waiting for the Constituent Assembly. It was this bogy
      (“arbitrary action”) that Minister Shingaryov once trotted out
      in his famous telegram, which was widely featured in the press
      (see Pravda
No. 33).[1]


Arbitrary action, anarchy—what terrifying words! But let
      any Narodnik or Menshevik who wishes to think for
      himself consider for a minute the following question.
    
 

Before the revolution the land belonged to the landowners. That
      was not called anarchy. And what did that lead
      to? It led to a break-down all along the line, to “anarchy” in
      the fullest sense of the word, i.e., to the utter ruin of the
      country, the ruin of the majority of the population.

Is a way out of this conceivable other than by the
      widest application of energy, initiative and determination on
      the part of the majority of the population? Obviously,
      it is not.

What does all this add up to?

      1. The tsar’s supporters stand for the absolute rule of the
         landowners in the countryside and for their keeping all the
         land. They are not afraid of the “anarchy” which
         this actually entailed.

      2. The Cadet Shingaryov, representing all the capitalists and
         landowners (with the exception of a small group of tsarists),
         advocates “agricultural conciliation chambers under the rural
         supply committees for the purpose of effecting voluntary
         agreements between the tillers of the land and the
         landowners” (see his telegram). The petty-bourgeois
         politicians—the Narodniks and Mensheviks—are
         following in Shingaryov’s footsteps when they advise the
         peasants “to wait” until the Constituent Assembly meets and
         when they call the immediate confiscation of the land by the
         peasants in the local areas “anarchy”.

      3. The party of the proletariat (the Bolsheviks) stands for the
         immediate seizure of the land by the peasants in the local
         areas and recommends the greatest possible degree of
         organisation. We see no “anarchy” in this, for it is this
         decision, and this decision alone, that happens to be a
         majority decision of the local population.

Since when has a majority decision come to be called “anarchy”?
      Would it not be more correct to apply this appellation to the
      minority decision which both the tsarists and
      Shingaryov are proposing in various forms?

When Shingaryov tries to force the peasants into a “voluntary”
      “reconciliation” with the landowners, he is imposing a minority
      decision, because there is an average of 300 peasant families in
      Russia to every one family of the big landowners. If I tell
      three hundred families to come to a “voluntary” “agreement” with
      one family of a rich exploiter,

    

I am offering a
      decision in favour of the minority, and that means anarchy.


In raising this hullabaloo about “anarchy”, you capitalists are
      trying to disguise the fact that you stand for the interests of
      the one against those of the three hundred. This is the crux of
      the matter.

We may be told: But you want to have the matter decided by the
      local people alone, without waiting for the Constituent
      Assembly! And that is anarchy!

To this we reply: And what does Shingaryov want? He, too, wants
      the matter settled locally (by a “voluntary agreement” between
      the peasants and the landowners) without waiting for the
      Constituent Assembly!

On this point Shingaryov and we do not differ—we are both
      for a final decision by the Constituent Assembly and a
      preliminary decision—to be enforced—by the local
      people. We differ with Shingaryov only in saying that 300 shall
      decide and 1 shall submit, whereas Shingaryov says: if the 300
      decide, that will be “arbitrary action”, so let the 300 “agree”
      with the 1.

How low the Narodniks and Mensheviks must have fallen to help
      Shingaryov and Co. spread bourgeois terrors.

Fear of the people—that is what these alarmists and
      panicmongers are actuated by.

There is no reason to fear the people. The decision of the
      majority of workers and peasants is not anarchy. Such a
      decision is the only possible guarantee of democracy in general,
      and of success in the search for effective ways of combating the
      debacle in particular.

The “conciliation” machine is working at full speed. The Narodniks
      and Mensheviks are toiling in the sweat of their brow, making up
      a new list of ministers. We are on the eve of a “new”
      cabinet....

Alas! It will not be very new. The government of the capitalists
      will have a few petty-bourgeois ministers tacked on to it in the
      shape of Narodniks and Mensheviks who have allowed themselves to
      be lured to the support of the imperialist war.

We shall have more phrase-mongering, more fireworks, more lavish
      promises and bombast about “peace without annexations”—but
      no desire whatever to even enumerate frankly, precisely and
      truthfully the actual annexations effected, say, by
      three countries: Germany, Russia, and Britain.

How long, gentlemen of the old and the new cabinets, can one
      deceive oneself with the utopia that the peasants will support
      the capitalists (the well-to-do peasants are not the whole of
      the peasantry), with the utopia of an “offensive” at the front
      (in the name of “peace without annexations”)?

Elections to the district councils being close at hand, the two
      petty-bourgeois democratic parties, the Narodniks and the
      Mensheviks, have come out with high-sounding platforms. These
      platforms are exactly the same as those of the European bourgeois
      parties who are engaged in angling for the gullible uneducated
      mass of voters from among the petty proprietors, etc., such as,
      for instance, the platform of the Radical and
      Radical-Socialist
Party of
France.[1] The same specious phrases, the same lavish
      promises, the same vague formulations, the same silence on or
      forgetfulness of the main thing, namely, the actual
conditions on which the practicability of these promises
      depends.

At present these conditions are:
    

      (1) the imperialist war;
      (2) the existence of a capitalist government;
      (3) the impossibility of seriously improving the condition of
          the workers and the whole mass of working people without
          revolutionary encroachment on the “sacred right, of
          capitalist private property”;
      (4) the impossibility of carrying out the reforms promised by
          those parties while the old organs and machinery of
          government remain intact, while there exists a police force
          which is bound to back the capitalists and put a thousand
          and one obstacles in the way of such reforms.

For example: “House rents is in war time to be controlled”,
      “such stocks to be requisitioned for the public needs” (that is
      stocks of foodstuffs kept in stores or by private individuals)
      “communal stores, bakeries, canteens, and kitchens to be
      organized”—write the Mensheviks. “Proper attention to be
      paid to sanitation and hygiene,” echo the Narodniks (the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries)

 

Excellent wishes, to be sure. The trouble is that they cannot be
      carried out unless one stops supporting the imperialist
      war, stops supporting the loan (which is profitable to the
      capitalists), stops supporting the capitalist government, which
      safeguards capitalist profits, stops preserving the police, who
      are bound to obstruct, thwart, and kill any such reform, even if
      the government and the capitalists themselves did not present an
      ultimatum to the reformers (and they certainly will, once
      capitalist profits are involved).

The trouble is that once we forget the harsh and rigid
      conditions of capitalist domination, then all such platforms,
      all such lists of sweeping reforms are empty words, which in
      practice turn out to be either harmless “pious wishes”, or
      simple hoodwinking of the masses by ordinary bourgeois
      politicians.

We must face the truth squarely. We must not gloss it over, we
      must tell it to people in a straightforward manner. We must not
      brush the class struggle under the carpet, but clarify what
      relation it bears to the high-sounding, specious, delightful
      “radical” reforms.

Comrade workers, and all other citizens of Petrograd! In order
      to give the people all those pressing and essential reforms of
      which the Narodniks and the Mensheviks speak, one must throw
      over the policy of support for the imperial 1st war and war
      loans, support for the capitalist government and for the
      principle of the inviolability of capitalist profits. To carry
      out those reforms, one must not allow the police to be
      reinstated, as the Cadets are now doing, but have it
      replaced by a people’s militia. This is what the party of the
      proletariat should tell the people at elections, this is what it
      must say against the petty-bourgeois parties of the
      Narodniks and the Mensheviks. This is the essence of the
      proletarian municipal platform that is being glossed over by the
      petty-bourgeois parties.

Foremost in this platform, topping the list of reforms, there
      must be, as a basic condition for their actual realisation, the
      following three fundamental points:

      1. No support for the imperialist war (either in the form of
         support for the war loan, or in any other form).

      2. No support to the capitalist government.

      3. No reinstatement of the police, which must be replaced by a
         people’s militia.
 

Unless attention is focused on these cardinal questions, unless
      it is shown that all municipal reforms are contingent upon them,
      the municipal programme inevitably becomes (at best) a pious
      wish.

Let us examine point 3.

In all bourgeois republics, even the most democratic, the police
      (like the standing army) is the chief instrument of oppression
      of the masses, an instrument making for a possible restoration
      of the monarchy. The police beats up the “common people” in the
      police stations of New York, Geneva, and Paris; it favours the
      capitalists either because it is bribed to do so (America and
      other countries), or because it enjoys wealthy “patronage” and
      “protection” (Switzerland), or because of a combination of both
      (France). Separated as it is from the people, forming a
      professional caste of men trained in the practice of violence
      upon the poor, men who receive somewhat higher pay and the
      privileges that go with authority (to say nothing of
      “gratuities”), the police everywhere, in every republic, however
      democratic, where the bourgeoisie is in power, always remains
      the unfailing weapon, the chief support and protection of the
      bourgeoisie. No important radical reforms in favour of the
      working masses can be implemented through the police. That is
      objectively impossible.

A people’s militia instead of the police force and the standing
      army is a prerequisite of effective municipal reforms
      in the interests of the working people. At a time of revolution
      this prerequisite is practicable. And it is on this that we must
      concentrate the whole municipal platform, for the other two
      cardinal conditions apply to the state as a whole, and not only
      to municipal governments.

Just how this people’s militia can be brought into existence is
      something which experience will show. To enable the proletarians
      and semi-proletarians to serve in this militia, the employers
      must be made to pay them their full wages for the days and hours
      they spend in service. This is practicable. Whether we should
      first organise a workers’ militia by drawing upon the
      workers employed at the large factories, i.e.. the workers who
      are best organised and most capable of fulfilling the task of
      militiamen, or whether we should immediately organise
      general compulsory service for all adult men and women, who
      would devote to this service one

    

or two weeks a year and so on,
      is not a question of fundamental importance. There is no harm in
      the different districts adopting different procedures—in
      fact, it would make for richer experience, and the process of
      organisation would develop more smoothly and come closer to
      life’s practical requirements.

A people’s militia would mean education of the masses
      in the practices of democracy.

A people’s militia would mean government of the poor by the
      people themselves, chiefly by the poor, and not by the
      rich, not through their police.

A people’s militia would mean that control (over factories,
      dwellings, the distribution of products, etc.) would be
      real and not merely on paper.

A people’s militia would mean distribution without any bread
      queues, without any privileges for the rich.

A people’s militia would mean that quite a number of the serious
      and radical reforms listed also by the Narodniks and the
      Mensheviks would not remain mere pious wishes.

Comrades, working men and women of Petrograd! Go to the district
      council elections. Protect the interests of the poor
      population. Come out against the imperialist war, against
      support of the capitalist government, against the restoration of
      the police and for the immediate unqualified replacement of the
      police by a people’s militia.

      (1) Our Deputy must be unconditionally opposed to the present
      predatory imperialist war. This war is waged by the capitalists
      of all countries—Russia, Germany, Britain, etc.—for
      profits, and the subjugation of the weak nations.

      (2) So long as a capitalist government is at the head of the
          Russian nation, there must be no support for the government,
          which is carrying on a predatory war—not by a single
          kopek!

      (3) Our Deputy must stand for the immediate publication of the
          secret predatory treaties (relating to the subjugation of
          Persia, the partition of Turkey, Austria, etc.), which ex
          Tsar Nicholas concluded with the capitalists of Britain,
          France, etc.

      (4) Our Deputy must stand for the immediate abrogation of all
          these treaties. The Russian people, the workers and the
          peasants, do not wish to oppress and will not oppress any
          nation; they do not wish to and will not hold by force
          within the boundaries of Russia a single non-Russian
          (non-Great-Russian) nation. Freedom for all the peoples, a
          fraternal union of the workers and peasants of all
          nationalities!

      (5) Our Deputy must stand for the Russian Government offering
          openly, immediately and unconditionally, without
          equivocation and without the least delay, terms of peace to
          all the belligerent countries on the basis of
          freedom for all the oppressed or underprivileged
          nationalities without exception.
 

This means that the Great Russians shall not forcibly retain
      either Poland, or Kurland, or Ukraine, or Finland, or Armenia,
      or any other nation. The Great Russians offer a fraternal union
      to all the nations and propose the formation of a common state
      by voluntary consent of each individual people, and under no
      circumstances by means of violence, direct or indirect. The
      Great Russians, under the terms of such a peace, undertake
      immediately to withdraw their troops from Galicia, from Armenia,
      and from Persia, and to allow these nations and all
      other nations without exception freely to decide whether they
      wish to live as a separate state, or in union with whomsoever
      they please.

Germany, by the terms of such a peace, must not only relinquish
      all the territories she has seized since the beginning
      of the war, but also release the peoples she is keeping by force
      within the boundaries of Germany, namely, the Danes (Schleswig),
      the French (part of Alsace and Lorraine), the Poles (Poznan),
      etc. Germany must undertake immediately, and simultaneously with
      Russia, to withdraw her troops from all the regions she has
      seized, as well as from all the regions mentioned above, and
      allow each nation to decide freely, by a popular vote, whether
      it wishes to live as a separate state, or in union with
      whomsoever, it pleases. Germany must unconditionally and
      unequivocally relinquish all her colonies, for colonies are
      oppressed peoples.

Britain, by the terms of such a peace, must relinquish,
      immediately and unconditionally, not only the territories she
      has seized from others (the German colonies in Africa, etc., the
      Turkish lands, Mesopotamia, etc.), but all her own
      colonies as well. Britain, like Russia and Germany, must
      immediately withdraw her troops from all the territories she has
      seized, from her colonies, and also from Ireland, and let each
      nation decide by a free vote whether it wants to live as a
      separate state, or in union with whomsoever it wishes.

And so on: all the belligerent countries, without exception,
      must receive an offer to conclude an immediate peace on these
      clearly defined terms. The capitalists of all countries
      should no longer deceive the peoples by promising “peace without
      annexations” while holding on to their own annexed
      territories and continuing the war in order to wrest from the
      enemy “his own” annexed territories.
 

      (6) Our Deputy must not give any support, or vote for any loan,
          or give a kopek of the people’s money to any
          government that does not solemnly undertake immediately to
          offer to all the nations these terms for an immediate peace
          and to publish this offer within two days for
          everybody’s information.

That is how history puts the issue—and not history in
    general, but the economic and political history of the Russia of
    today.

The Narodniks and Mensheviks, Chernov and Tsereteli, have
      transferred the Contact Commission from the room adjacent to the
      one the ministers used to meet in to the ministerial chamber
      itself. This, and this alone, is the purely political
      significance of the “new” cabinet.

Its economic and class significance is that, at the best (from
      the point of view of the stability of the cabinet and the
      preservation of capitalist domination), the leadership of the
      peasant bourgeoisie, headed since 1906 by Peshekhonov, and the
      petty-bourgeois “leaders” of the Menshevist workers have
      promised the capitalists their class collaboration. (At
      the worst—for the capitalists—the whole change has a
      purely personal or clique significance, but no class
      significance at all.)

Let us assume that the more favourable eventuality is the
      case. Even so, there is not a shadow of doubt that the promisers
      will be unable to fulfil their promises. “We shall—in
      co-operation with the capitalists—help the country out of
      Its crisis, save it from ruin and get it out of the
      war”—that is what the action of the petty-bourgeois
      leaders, the Chernovs and Tseretelis, in joining the cabinet
      really amounts to. Our answer is: Your help is not enough. The
      crisis has advanced infinitely farther than you imagine only the
      revolutionary class, by taking revolutionary measures against

    

capital, can save the country—and not our country
      alone.

The crisis is so profound, so widespread, of such vast
      world-wide scope, and so closely bound up with Capital itself,
      that the class struggle against Capital must inevitably assume
      the form of political supremacy by the proletariat and
      semi-proletariat. There is no other way out.

You want to have revolutionary enthusiasm in the army, Citizens
      Chernov and Tsereteli? But you cannot create it, because the
      revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is not begotten by a
      change of “leaders” in cabinets, by florid declarations, or by
      promises to take steps to revise the treaty with the British
      capitalists; it can be aroused only by acts of revolutionary
      policy patent to all and undertaken daily and everywhere
      against almighty Capital and against its making profits
      out of the war, a policy that will make for a radical
      improvement in the standard of living of the mass of the
      poor.

Even if you were to hand over all the land to the people
      immediately, this would not end the crisis unless revolutionary
      measures were taken against Capital.

You want an offensive, Citizens Chernov and Tsereteli? But you
      cannot rouse the army to an offensive, because you cannot use
      force against the people today. And unless force is
      used against them the people would undertake an offensive only
      in the great interests of the great revolution against Capital
      in all countries; and not merely a revolution promised and
      proclaimed, but a revolution actually in process of realisation,
      a revolution which is being carried out in actual fact, and is
      tangible to all.

You want to organise supply, Citizens Peshekhonovs and
      Skobelevs, the supply of goods for the peasants, of bread and
      meat for the army, of raw material for industry, and so forth?
      You want control over, and partly even the, organisation of,
      production?

You cannot do this without the revolutionary enthusiasm of the
      proletarian and semi-proletarian mass. This enthusiasm can be
      aroused only by taking revolutionary measures against the
      privileges and profits of Capital. Failing this, your promised
      control will remain a dead, capitalist, bureaucratic
      palliative.
 

The experiment at class collaboration with Capital is now being
      made by the Chernovs and Tseretelis, and by certain sections of
      the petty bourgeoisie, on a new, gigantic, all-Russia scale.
    

All the more valuable will be its lessons for the people, when
      the latter become convinced—and that apparently will be
      soon—of the futility and hopelessness of such
      collaboration.

We are for a strong revolutionary government. Whatever the
      capitalists and their flunkeys may shout about us to the
      contrary, their lies will remain lies.

The thing is not to let phrases obscure one’s consciousness,
      disorient one’s mind. When people speak about “revolution”, “the
      revolutionary people”, “revolutionary democracy”, and so on,
      nine times out of ten this is a lie or
      self-deception. The question is—what class is
      making this revolution? A revolution against whom?

Against tsarism? In that sense most of Russia’s landowners and
      capitalists today are revolutionaries. When the revolution is an
      accomplished fact, even reactionaries come into line with
      it. There is no deception of the masses at present more
      frequent, more detestable, and more harmful than that which
      lauds the revolution against tsarism.

Against the landowners? In this sense most of the peasants, even
      most of the well-to-do peasants, that is, probably nine-tenths
      of the population in Russia, are revolutionaries. Very likely,
      some of the capitalists, too, are prepared to become
      revolutionaries on the grounds that the landowners cannot be
      saved anyway, so let us better side with the revolution and try
      to make things safe for capitalism.

Against the capitalists? Now that is the real issue. That is the
      crux of the matter, because without a revolution against the
      capitalists, all that prattle about “peace without annexations”
      and the speedy termination of the war by such a peace is either
      naïveté and ignorance, or stupidity and deception. But for the
      war, Russia could have gone on living for years and decades
      without a revolution against the capitalists. The war has made
      that objectively impossible. The alternatives are either utter
      ruin or a revolution against the capitalists. That is how the
      question stands. That is how the very trend of events poses
      it.
 

Instinctively, emotionally, and by attraction, the bulk of
      Russia’s population, namely, the proletarians and semi
      proletarians, i.e., the workers and poor peasants, are in
      sympathy with a revolution against the capitalists. So far,
      however, there is no clear consciousness of this, and, as a
      result, no determination. To develop these is our chief
      task.

The leaders of the petty bourgeoisie—the intellectuals, the
      prosperous peasants, the present parties of the Narodniks (the
      S.R.s included) and the Mensheviks—are not at
      present in favour of a revolution against the capitalists and
      some of them are even opposed to it, greatly to the detriment of
      the people’s cause. The coalition cabinet is the kind of
      “experiment” that is going to help the people as a whole to
      quickly discard the illusion of petty-bourgeois
      conciliation with the capitalists.

The conclusion is obvious: only assumption of power by the
      proletariat, backed by the semi-proletarians, can give the
      country a really strong and really revolutionary government. It
      will be really strong because it will be supported by a solid
      and class-conscious majority of the people. It will be strong
      because it will not, of necessity, have to be based on a
      precarious “agreement” between capitalists and small
      proprietors, between millionaires and petty bourgeoisie, between
      the Konovalovs-Shingaryovs and the Chernovs-Tseretelis.

It will be a truly revolutionary government, the only one
      capable of showing the people that at a time when untold
      suffering is inflicted upon the masses it will not be awed and
      deterred by capitalist profits. It will be a truly revolutionary
      government because it alone will be capable of evoking and
      sustaining the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and
      increasing it tenfold, provided the masses, every day and every
      hour, see and feel that the government believes in the people,
      is not afraid of them, that it helps the poor to improve their
      lot right now, that it makes the rich bear an equal
      share of the heavy burden of the people’s suffering.

We are for a strong revolutionary government.

We are for a strong revolutionary government because it is the
      only possible and the only reliable government.

From a Rech editorial, penned with an air of heavy
      gravity:


      “Let us hope that no great shocks to our relations with the
      Allies will ho needed to prove to the supporters of the formula
      ‘without annexations or indemnities’ [read: to the new
      government] that it is impracticable.”



They are right, the capitalists for whom Rech
      speaks. The formula is indeed “impracticable” ... unless a
      revolution against capital is put into practice!
 *     *  * 

From a speech by Milyukov, who didn’t resign, but got the
      sack:


      “Whatever noble formulas of friendship for the Allies we may
      devise, once our army remains inactive, we shall merely be
      shirking our obligations. And vice versa, whatever terrible
      formulas betraying our loyalties we may devise once our army is
      actually fighting, then that, of course, will be actual
      fulfilment of our obligations towards the Allies.” 


Correct! He knows what he is talking about sometimes, does
      Citizen Milyukov! Citizens Chernov and Tsereteli, don’t you
      realise what inference is to be drawn from this as regards your
      actual attitude towards the imperialist war?
 *     *  * 

From a speech by Shulgin at a meeting of the rallying
      counter-revolution:


      “we prefer to be beggars, but beggars in our own country. If you
      ran preserve that country and keep it safe for us, then take our
      last shirt from us. we shall shed no tear.” 

 

Don’t try to frighten us, Mr. Shulgin. Even when we are
      in power we shall not take your “last shirt” from you, but shall
      see that you are provided with good clothes and good food, on
      condition that you do the job you are fit for and used to! You
      can frighten the Chernovs and the Tseretelis, but you can t
      frighten us.
 *     *  * 

From a speech by Maklakov at the same meeting (of “members of
      the Duma”):


      “Russia has proved unworthy of the freedom she has won.” 


Read: the workers and peasants have failed to satisfy the
      Maklakovs. These gentlemen want the Chernovs and Tseretelis to
      “reconcile” the masses with the Maklakovs. It won’t work!
 *     *  * 

From the same speech:


      “Many people can be blamed, but we, in Russia, can’t do without
      the bourgeoisie or the proletariat, without the various currents
      or the various individuals.” 


We beg your pardon, Citizen Maklakov, but “we” (the party of the
      proletariat) “can do without the bourgeoisie” “in Russia”. Time
      will show you and make you admit that there was no other way out
      of the imperialist war,
 *     *  * 

From the same speech:


      “We see a mass of evil instincts which have risen to the
      surface: we see a reluctance to work, reluctance to recognise
      one’s duty to one’s country. We see that at a time of cruel
      warfare this country has become a land of festivities, meetings
      and talk, a country that does not recognise authority and
      refuses to obey it.” 


Correct! A mass of “evil instincts”, especially among the
      landowners and the capitalists. The petty bourgeois has evil
      instincts, too: for instance, the instinct that drives him into
      a coalition cabinet with capitalists. The proletarians and
      semi-proletarians have evil instincts, too: for example, they
      are slow in discarding petty-bourgeois illusions, slow

    

in coming
      to the conclusion that all “power” must be taken over
      by this class, and this class alone.
 *     *  * 

From the same speech:


      “The government will move steadily leftward, while the country
      will move farther and farther to the right.” 


By “the country” Maklakov means the capitalists. In this sense
      he is right. But “the country” of the workers and the poor
      peasants. I assure you, Citizen Maklakov, is a thousand times
      more leftward than the Chernovs and the Tseretelis, and a
      hundred times more leftward than we are. The future will prove
      this to you.

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
With the exception of the Rech editorial, this article was
      written on the basis of speeches made at a private meeting of
      the Fourth Duma members in Petrograd, reported in newspapers for
      May 5 (18), 1917.


After the February revolution the Provisional Government did
      not, in spite of the public demand, officially dissolve the
      Fourth Duma, the members of which (from the violent monarchists
      to the Cadets) regularly gathered at private meetings held at
      the residence of M. V. Rodzyanko, the Chairman of the Duma, to
      discuss and adopt resolutions on important issues of foreign and
      domestic policy. These meetings were widely reported in the
      bourgeois press. Lenin called these meetings of the Fourth Duma
      deputies “the headquarters of counter-revolution”.


The particular meeting referred to in this article was held on
      May 4 (17), 1917, and was attended by representatives of all the
      Duma parties except the Social-Democrats. Speeches were made by
      the Octobrist and Cadet leaders A. I. Guchkov, V. A. Maklakov,
      P. N. Milyukov N. V. Savich, V. V. Shulgin and others, the
      fundamentals of which was summed up in two demands: first, that
      the Russian army resume offensive operations at the front, and
      second, that “order” be restored in the army and in the country
      at large, i.e. reaction. The aim of the meeting was to bring
      pressure to bear on the new, coalition, government.


In June-July the counter-revolutionary activities of the Fourth
      Duma deputies increased still further. On June 2 (15) Rodzyanko
      addressed a letter to the deputies of the Fourth Duma calling
      upon them not to leave Petrograd. since “current political
      events required that the members of the Duma should be ready on
      the spot”.


On the demand of the Bolsheviks, the Fourth Duma was officially
      dissolved by the Provisional Government on October 6 (19),
      1917.

Here is the evidence:

The evening edition of Russkaya
      Volya[1]

(Russian Freedom indeed!) for May 4 has this to report
      about the feeling prevailing among the delegates to the Peasant
      Congress, which is now in session:


      “The delegates’ main grievance, voiced on behalf of the
      peasants, is that while all classes are already reaping the
      fruits of the revolution the peasants alone are still waiting
      for their share The peasants alone are told to wait until the
      Constituent Assembly meets and settles the land question.

      “‘We don’t agree,’ they say. ‘We’re not going to wait, just as
      others have not waited. We want the land now, at once.’”


There is no doubt that the reporter of Russkaya Volya,
      a paper that serves the worst of the capitalists, is not
      slandering the peasants in this case (there is no sense in
      lying), but is telling the truth, is warning the
      capitalists. All the news coming from the Congress
      confirms this truth.

Compare this truth with Section 5 of the “new” government’s
      draft declaration:

      “While leaving it to the Constituent Assembly to settle the
      question of transferring the land to the working people, the
      Provisional Government will take ... measures,” etc. (the “old”
      Provisional Government also kept on “taking measures”...).
 

The “new” government is already lagging hopelessly behind even
      the Peasant
      Congress!
    

This is a fact, surprising though it may be to many.
    

And facts are stubborn things, as the English say.

Yesterday, May 5, two of the big dailies—Dyelo
      Naroda and Rech—carried an announcement on
      their front pages, later reprinted in the Guchkov-Suvorin
      evening paper Vecherneye
      Vremya,[1] which deserves serious attention.

The public is informed that “in accordance with an agreement
      between the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and the
      Union of Engineers, as authorised by the Provisional
      Government”, there has been organised in Petrograd a “Central
      Committee for restoring and maintaining normal work in the
      industrial enterprises”.


      “The main task of the Central Committee,” the announcement
      reads, “is to work out and co-ordinate all measures aimed at
      restoring and maintaining normal work in the industrial
      enterprises and to organise regular and active public
      control over all industrial enterprises.” 


The words “public control” were italicised in the
      announcement.

They remind one of the Senate and other bureaucratic committees
      of the good old tsarist days. No sooner had some knave of a
      tsar’s minister, governor, marshal of the nobility, etc., been
      caught red-handed at some thievery, no sooner had some
      institution directly or indirectly connected with the tsar’s
      government conspicuously disgraced itself through out Russia or
      throughout Europe, than a high commission of “personages”
      notable and super-notable, high-ranking and super-ranking, rich
      and super-rich was appointed to “appease public
      opinion”. 

And these personages usually managed to “appease” public opinion
      with conspicuous success. The more high-sounding the phrases
      about our wise tsar salving “the popular

    

conscience” the more
      effectively did these men kill the idea of any “public
      control”. 

So it was, so it will be, one feels like saying as one reads the
      pompously worded announcement about the new Central
      Committee.

The capitalists have decided to steal a march on the
      workers. There is a growing consciousness among the workers that
      a proletarian control over factories and syndicates is
      necessary. The master minds of the business world from among
      ministerial and near-ministerial circles have had a “brain
      wave”—to forestall events and take the Soviet in tow. This
      should not be difficult, they thought, so long as the Narodniks
      and Mensheviks are still in control there. We’ll fix up “public
      control”, they said to themselves. It will look so Important, so
      statesmanlike, so ministerial, so solid. And it will kill all
      possible real control, all proletarian control so
      effectively, so quietly. A brilliant idea! The “popular
      conscience” will be completely “salved”.

How is this new Central Committee to be composed?
    

Why, on
      democratic lines, of course. Are we not all
      “revolutionary democrats”? If anyone thinks that democracy
      requires 20 representatives from 200,000 workers and one
      representative from 10,000 engineers, capitalists, etc., that
      would be an “anarchist” delusion. No, true democracy consists in
      imitating the way in which “revolutionary democracy” has
      composed its “new” government, where the workers and peasants
      are “represented” by six Mensheviks and Narodniks while eight
      Cadets and Octobrists represent the landowners and the
      capitalists. Do not the latest statistical surveys now being
      completed by the new Ministry of Labour by arrangement with the
      old Ministry of Industry prove that the majority of Russia’s
      population belongs to the class of land owners and
      capitalists?

Here, if you please, is a complete list of
      “representatives” of the organisations that have been included
      in the new Central Committee by agreement between “revolutionary
      democracy” and the government.

The Central Committee is composed of representatives from the
      following organisations:
    

      (1) The Executive Committee of the Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies;
      (2) The Provisional Committee of the Duma;
      (3) The All-Russia

    



Union of Zemstvos;
      (4) The All-Russia Union of Cities;
      (5) The Petrograd Municipal Administration;
      (6) The Union of Engineers;
      (7) The Soviet of Officers’ Deputies;
      (8) The Council of Congresses of Representatives of
      Industry and Commerce;
      (9) The Petrograd Society of Factory Owners;
      (10) The Central War Industries Committee;
      (11) The Central Committee of Zemstvo and City Unions for Army
      Supply;
      (12) The Committee of Technical War Aid;
      (13) The Free-Economic Society.
    

And that’s all?

Yes, that’s all.

Is that not sufficient for salving the popular conscience?


Yes, but what if some big bank or syndicate of capitalists is
      represented five or ten times through its share holders in these
      ten or twelve institutions?

Oh, why quibble about “details”, when the main thing is to
      secure “a regular and active public control”!

Comrades, peasant deputies,

The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party (Bolsheviks), to which I have the honour to belong, wanted
      me to represent our Party at the Peasant Congress, but illness
      has prevented me from carrying out this commission. I therefore
      take the liberty of addressing this open letter to you in order
      to greet the all-Russia union of the peasantry and briefly to
      point out the deep-seated differences that divide our Party on
      the one hand and the party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      the Menshevik Social-Democrats on the other.

These profound differences concern the three most important
      issues: the land, the war, and state organisation.

All the land must belong to the people. All the landed estates
      must be turned over to the peasants without compensation. This
      is clear. The dispute here is whether or not the peasants in the
      local areas should take all the land at once, without paying any
      rent to the landowners, or wait until the Constituent Assembly
      meets.

Our Party believes that they should, and advises the peasants
      locally—to take over all the land without delay, and to
      do it in as organised a way as possible, under no circumstances
      allowing damage to property and exerting every effort to
      increase the production of grain and meat since the troops at
      the front are in dire straits. In any case, although the final
      decision on how to dispose of the land will be made by the
      Constituent Assembly, a preliminary settlement now, at once, in
      time for the spring sowing, can be made only by

    

local bodies,
      inasmuch as our Provisional Government, which is a government of
      the landowners and capitalists, is putting off the convocation
      of the Constituent Assembly and so far has not even fixed a date
      for it.

Only local bodies are able preliminarily to take charge of the
      land. The fields must be sown to crops. Most of the peasants in
      the local areas are quite capable of making use of the land in
      an organised way, of ploughing and putting it all under
      crops. This is essential if the supply of food to the soldiers
      at the front is to be improved. Hence, to wait for the
      Constituent Assembly is out of the question. We by no means deny
      the right of the Constituent Assembly finally to institute
      public ownership of the land and to regulate its disposal. In
      the meantime, however, right now, this spring, the peasants
      themselves must decide locally what to do with it. The soldiers
      at the front can and should send delegates to the villages.

Further. For all the land to pass over to the working people, a
      close alliance of the urban workers and the poor peasants
      (semi-proletarians) is essential. Unless such an alliance is
      formed, the capitalists cannot be defeated. And if they are not
      defeated, no transfer of the land to the people will deliver
      them from poverty. You cannot eat land, and without money,
      without capital, there is no way of obtaining implements,
      livestock, or seed. The peasants must trust not the capitalists
      or the rich
      muzhiks (who are capitalists too), but only the urban
      workers. Only in alliance with the latter can the poor peasants
      ensure that the land, the railways, the banks, and the factories
      become the property of all the working people; if this is not
      done, the mere transfer of the land to the people cannot abolish
      want and pauperism.

Workers in certain localities in Russia are already beginning to
      establish their supervision (control) over the factories. Such
      control by the workers is to the peasants’ advantage, for it
      means increased production and cheaper products. The peasants
      must give their fullest support to this initiative on the part
      of the workers and not believe the slander which the capitalists
      spread against the workers.

The second question is the question of the war.

This war is a war of conquest. It is being waged by the
      capitalists of all countries with predatory aims, to increase

    

their profits. To the working people this war can spell only
      ruin, suffering, devastation, and brutalisation. That is why our
      Party, the party of class-conscious workers and poor peasants,
      emphatically and unqualifiedly condemns this war, refuses to
      justify the capitalists of the one country as against the
      capitalists of another, refuses to support the capitalists of
      any country whatever, and is working for the speediest
      termination of the war through the overthrow of the capitalists
      in all countries, through a workers’ revolution in all
      countries.

In our new Provisional Government, there are ten ministers
      belonging to the landowner and capitalist parties and six to the
      Narodnik (Socialist-Revolutionary) and Menshevik
      Social-Democratic parties. In our opinion the Narodniks and
      Mensheviks have made a grave and fatal mistake in joining the
      capitalist government and in general agreeing to support it. Men
      like Tsereteli and Chernov are hoping to induce the capitalists
      to bring the present predatory war to a speedy and more
      honourable end. But these leaders of the Narodnik and Menshevik
      parties are mistaken: they are, in effect, helping the
      capitalists to prepare an offensive by the Russian troops
      against Germany, that is, to drag out the war, to add to the
      incredibly enormous sacrifices the Russian people have made in
      the war.

We are convinced that the capitalists in all countries are
      deceiving the people by promising an early and just peace when
      they are actually prolonging the war of conquest, The Russian
      capitalists, who controlled the old Provisional Government and
      continue to control the new one, did not even wish to publish
      the secret predatory treaties ex-Tsar Nicholas Romanov concluded
      with the capitalists of Britain, France, and other countries
      with the object of wresting Constantinople from the Turks,
      Galicia from the Austrians, Armenia from the Turks, and so
      on. The Provisional Government has confirmed these treaties.

Our Party maintains that these treaties are just as criminal and
      predatory as the treaties the German brigand-capitalists and
      their brigand-Emperor Wilhelm have with their allies.

The blood of the workers and peasants must not be shed for the
      sake of such predatory aims of the capitalists.
 

This criminal war must be brought to a speedy end, not
      by a separate peace with Germany, but by a universal
      peace, not by a capitalist peace, but by a peace of the
      working masses against the capitalists. There is only
      one way to do this, and that is by transferring all state power
      to the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies
      both in Russia and in other countries. Only such Soviets will be
      able effectively to prevent the capitalists from deceiving the
      peoples, and prevent the war being dragged on by the
      capitalists.

This brings me to the third and last of the questions I have
      mentioned: the question of state organisation.

Russia must become a democratic republic. Even the majority of
      the landowners and capitalists, who have always stood for the
      monarchy but now see that the people of Russia will on no
      account allow it to be restored, are in agreement with this. The
      capitalists now have directed all their efforts at making the
      Russian republic as much like a monarchy as possible so that it
      might be changed back into a monarchy with the least difficulty
      (this has happened time and again in many countries). For this
      purpose the capitalists want to preserve the bureaucracy, which
      stands above the people, to preserve the police and the
      standing army, which is separated from the people and commanded
      by non-elective generals and other officers. And the generals
      and other officers, unless they are elected, will almost
      invariably be landowners and capitalists. That much we know from
      the experience of all the republics in the world.

Our Party, the party of class-conscious workers and poor
      peasants, is therefore working for a democratic republic of
      another kind. We want a republic where there is no police that
      browbeats the people; where all officials, from the bottom up,
      are elective and displaceable whenever the people demand it, and
      are paid salaries not higher than the wages of a competent
      worker; where all army officers are similarly elective and where
      the standing army separated from the people and subordinated to
      classes alien to the people is replaced by the universally armed
      people, by a people’s militia.

We want a republic where all state power, from the bottom up,
      belongs wholly and exclusively to the

    

Soviets of Workers’,
      Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other Deputies.

The workers and peasants are the majority of the population. The
      power must belong to them, not to the landowners or the
      capitalists.

The workers and peasants are the majority of the population. The
      power and the functions of administration must belong to
      their Soviets, not to the bureaucracy.

Such are our views, comrade peasant deputies. We are firmly
      convinced that experience will soon show the broad masses how
      erroneous the policy of the Narodniks and Mensheviks
      is. Experience will soon show the masses that compromise with
      the capitalists cannot save Russia, which, like Germany and
      other countries, is standing on the brink of disaster, cannot
      save the war-wearied peoples. The transfer of all state power
      directly to the majority of the population alone can save the
      peoples.

Novaya Zhizn for May 7 publishes interviews with
      ministers of the “new” government. Prime Minister Lvov has
      declared that “the country must have its weighty say and send
      its army into battle”.

This is the sum and substance of the new government’s
      “programme”. An offensive, an offensive, an offensive!

Defending this imperialist programme, now accepted by the
      Chernovs and the Tseretelis, Minister Lvov in tones of deepest
      moral indignation fulminates against the “virtual armistice
      that has been established at the front”! 

Let every Russian worker, let every peasant give careful thought
      to this programme of offensive, to these violent
      ministerial diatribes against the “virtual armistice”. 

Millions of people have been killed and crippled in the
      war. Untold sufferings have fallen to the lot of the people,
      particularly the working masses, as a result of the war. The
      capitalists are making scandalously high profits out of the
      war. The soldiers are utterly worn out.

What is wrong with a virtual armistice? What is wrong with
      having the slaughter stopped? What is wrong with the soldiers
      getting at least a brief respite?

We are told that an armistice has been established only on one
      front, and therefore there is a danger of a separate peace. But
      this argument does not hold water. If neither the
      Russian Government nor the Russian workers and peas ants
      want a separate peace with the German capitalists (our
      Party, as we know, through Pravda and in the resolution
      passed at our
      Conference,[1]

which spoke in the name of the

    

Party as a whole,
      has repeatedly protested against such a peace)—if no one in
      Russia wants a separate peace with separate capitalists, how
      then, by what miracle, can such a peace come? Who can impose
      it?

The objection is clearly untenable. It is sheer invention, an
      attempt to throw dust in our eyes.

Further, why should a virtual armistice on one front imply the
      “danger” of a separate peace on that front, and not the
      danger of such an armistice spreading to all fronts? 

A virtual armistice is an unstable transitional state of
      affairs. This is incontrovertible. Transitional to what? It
      cannot lead to a separate peace so long as there is no
      mutual agreement between the two governments or two nations. But
      why could not such an armistice lead to a virtual truce on
      all fronts? Surely this is what all nations
      agree with, despite all or most of their governments!

Fraternisation on one front can and should lead to
      fraternisation on all fronts. A virtual armistice on one front
      can and should lead to a virtual armistice on all fronts.

The nations would thus gain a respite from the carnage. The
      revolutionary workers in all the countries would raise
      their heads still higher; their influence would increase, and
      faith in the possibility and necessity of a workers’ revolution
      in the advanced capitalist countries would become
      strengthened.

What is wrong with such a transition? Why should we not help to
      bring it about as far as it is in our power to do so?

We may be told that a virtual armistice today on all fronts
      would help the German capitalists, who have snatched more loot
      than anybody else. This is not true. For one thing, the British
      capitalists have grabbed more (the German colonies in Africa,
      German islands in the Pacific, Mesopotamia, part of Syria, etc.)
      and, unlike the German capitalists, have lost nothing. Secondly,
      if the German capitalists had shown greater obstinacy than the
      British capitalists, the growth of the revolution in Germany
      would have only been accelerated. The revolution in Germany is
      obviously mounting. An offensive by the Russian troops would
      check this growth. The “virtual armistice” hastens the rise of
      this revolution.
 

Thirdly, what with growing hunger, ruin, and disorganisation,
      Germany is in desperate straits, being worse off than any other
      country, especially since the United States has entered the
      war. A “virtual armistice” would not remove this
      fundamental source of Germany’s weakness; on the contrary, it is
      likely to improve the position of the other countries (greater
      freedom for bringing up supplies) while worsening that of the
      German capitalists (who have nowhere to bring supplies up from
      and will have greater difficulty in hiding the truth from the
      people).

The Russian people have two programmes to choose from. One is
      the programme of the capitalists, adopted by the Chernovs and
      Tseretelis. This is the programme of offensive, the programme
      for dragging out the imperialist war, dragging out the
      carnage.

The other programme is that of the world’s revolutionary
      workers, advocated in Russia by our Party. This programme says:
      stimulate fraternisation (but do not permit the Germans to
      deceive the Russians); fraternise by means of proclamations;
      extend fraternisation and a virtual armistice to all fronts;
      help to spread these in every possible way, thereby hastening
      the proletarian revolution in all the countries, giving at least
      a temporary respite to the soldiers of all the belligerent
      countries; hasten in Russia the transfer of power to the Soviets
      of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies, and thereby
      hasten the conclusion of a really just, really universal peace
      in the interests of the working people, and not in the interests
      of the capitalists.

Our government, with the Chernovs and Tseretelis, the Narodniks
      and the Mensheviks, is for the first programme.

The majority of the Russian nation and of all the nations within
      Russia (and outside Russia), i.e., the majority of the workers
      and poor peasants, undoubtedly stand for the second
      programme.

The victory of this second programme is drawing nearer
      every day.

What a pity that the masses cannot read books on the history of
      diplomacy, or the editorials in the capitalist newspapers. And
      an even greater pity—though in this case pity is too feeble
      a word—that the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      ministers and their ministeriable colleagues should maintain
      such a discreet silence on certain facts of diplomatic history
      and on the utterances of the “great diplomatic minds”, though
      these are only too well known to them.

Rech quotes what it claims to be a reliable report in
      Birzhevka to the effect that Britain is quite prepared
      to renounce the “dismemberment of Turkey and partitioning of
      Austria-Hungary”. In other words, Britain readily consents to
      Russia not getting the annexations promised her under
      earlier treaties (Constantinople, Armenia, Galicia). In
      this sense—and in this sense alone—Britain is
      prepared to revise the treaties.

And Rech waxes indignant:


      “So this is the first result of the triumph of the new slogan
      [the slogan of peace without annexations and indemnities]. The
      agreement will very likely be revised: our Allies—not
      we—are already taking ’preparatory steps’ towards that
      end. The result of this revision, however, will be not a uniform
      [mark this!] renunciation of the major objectives of all the
      Allies, but a one-sided [isn’t that a gem?] renunciation of the
      objectives in South-Eastern Europe [read: in Austria and Turkey,
      i.e., the plundering of Armenia, Constantinople, Galicia] in
      favour of objectives in other areas and in the colonies,
      formulated not by us hut by our Allies.

      “In particular, there have been press reports suggesting that
      our Allies might abandon their objectives in Asia Minor. True,
      there is so far no official confirmation of the statements to
      that effect said to have been made by Albert Thomas in the
      Soviet of Workers’ and soldiers’ Deputies and reported in the
      Moscow press. It would be difficult, however, to expect any such
      action as far as Britain is concerned.

    

For Britain takes the
      correct view that possession is nine-tenths of the law [mark
      this!] and her troops are already occupying parts of Mesopotamia
      and Palestine which are of vital interest to her tread: to her
      capitalists). In these circumstances, Britain’s refusal to fight
      for the vital interests of the other [Rech’s italics]
      Allies would, of course, likewise be a one-sided act
      advantageous to her alone.” 


Truly, Milyukov, or whoever it was wrote these lines, deserves
      to have a monument set up to him in his lifetime... for
      frankness. Bravo, candid Rech diplomats! (And why are
      they candid? Because they were angered at Milyukov being
      deprived of his portfolio.)

Everything that has been said in the lines quoted above is the
      truth, a truth confirmed by the recent history of diplomacy
      and the history of foreign investments. Britain at any
      rate will not renounce the seizure (annexation) of Palestine and
      Mesopotamia, though she is prepared to punish the Russians (for
      the “virtual armistice” on the Russian-German front) by denying
      them Galicia, Constantinople, Armenia, etc. That, in plain,
      non-diplomatic language, is the meaning of these statements in
      Rech. 

And the Russian capitalists for whom Rech speaks can
      barely hold back their anger. Foaming at the mouth, they are
      blurting out the secrets of foreign policy and taking digs at
      the British capitalists: what you are doing is “one-sided”, it
      is to your “advantage”, and to the disadvantage of
      others. 

Comrades, workers and soldiers! Consider these strikingly frank
      and strikingly truthful statements of Rech, coming from
      well-informed diplomats and former ministers, consider this
      excellent exposure of the real aims which not only the
      Russian, but the British capitalists, too, are pursuing in the
      war.

Russian soldiers! Do you want to fight to help the British
      capitalists seize Mesopotamia and Palestine? Do you want to
      support the Russian Government of Lvov, Chernov, Tereshchenko,
      Tsereteli, a government bound by the interests of the
      capitalists and afraid openly to state the true facts
      which have been blurted out by Rech?

We all know that the “revolutionary” Provisional Government’s
      first word on foreign policy was the declaration that all secret
      treaties concluded by ex-Tsar Nicholas II with the “Allied”
      capitalists remained in force, and that the new Russia would
      regard them as sacred and inviolable.
    

We know, furthermore, that our “defencists” vehemently support
      the Milyukovs’ refusal to publish the secret treaties. These
      so-called socialist have sunk so low as to defend secret
      diplomacy, and the secret diplomacy of the ex-tsar at that.
    

Why do the supporters of the imperialist war guard the secret of
      these treaties so zealously?
    

Do you want to know why, comrade workers and soldiers?
    

Familiarise yourselves with at least one of these noble
      treaties–“our” treaty with Italy (i.e., with the Italian
      capitalists) signed at the beginning of 1915.
    

On the basis of material published in Novoye Vremya,
      Mr. V. Vodovozov, a bourgeois democrat, reveals in Dyen
      (for May 6, 1917) the contents of that treaty:
    


      “The Allies have guaranteed Italy Southern Tyrol with Trient,
      the entire coastline, and the northern part of Dalmatia with the
      towns of Zara and Spalato, the central part of Albania with
      Valona, the Aegean islands off the coast of Asia Minor, as well
      as a profitable railway concession in Asiatic Turkey–such is
      the price for which Italy has traded her blood. These
      annexations exceed any national claims ever advanced by Italy
      many times over. In addition to regions with an Italian
      population (Southern Tyrol and Trieste) of nearly 600,000,
      Italy, under this treaty, is to receive territories with a
      population of over a million who are absolutely alien to Italy
      eghnographically and in point of religion. These include, for
      instance, Dalmatia, 97 per cent of whose population are Serbs
      and only slightly over 2 per cent Italians. It is only natural
      that this treaty with Italy, concluded without

    

the knowledge or
      consent of Serbia, should have provoked such bitterness and
      resentment in that country.

      Pašic,

      



      speaking in the
      Skupshtina, expressed the hope that the rumours concerning the
      treaty were false, since Italy herself had united in the name of
      the principle of national unity, and could not therefore do
      anything that was likely to strike at the very roots of that
      principle. But

      Pašic

      

      was wrong; the treaty was concluded.
    

      “This is the only treaty concerning the present war whose
      contents we know of, and this treaty is grossly
      predatory. Whether similar predatory instincts are or are not
      reflected in other treaties, we do not know. At any rate, it is
      extremely important that democracy, on whose banner is inscribed
      ‘peace without annexations’, should know this.”
    


      “We do not know” to what extent the other secret treaties are
      predatory? No, Mr. Vodovozov, we know it very well: the secret
      treaties concerning the carve-up of Persia and Turkey, the
      seizure of Galicia and Armenia are just as dirty and predatory
      as the rapacious treaty with Italy.
    

Comrade soldiers and workers! You are told that you are
      defending “freedom” and the “revolution”! In reality you are
      defending the shady treaties of the tsar, which are concealed
      from you as one conceals a secret disease.

The editors of Ivestia of the Petrograd Soviet have
    adopted a ministerial tone. They do not like Pravda; they
    condemn it for its “sharp attacks against the Provisional
    Government”.

To criticise what he doesn’t like is the sacred right of every
      publicist. But why make oneself ridiculous by dispensing
      ministerial censure for our “attacks” without criticising the
      issues we raise? Would it not be better to analyse our
      arguments, or at least one of our resolutions, or at least one
      of our statements on the class struggle?

      “The country today is heading for ruin,” says
      Izvestia’s editorial. Correct. For that very reason it
      would be unwise today to rely on the conciliatory policy of the
      petty bourgeoisie, the Narodniks and the Mensheviks, with regard
      to the capitalists. The country cannot be saved from ruin in
      that way.

The newspaper of ex-Minister Milyukov is so furious with the
    Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries for having forced certain
    individuals out of the cabinet that it lets itself be forced into
    making rather “indiscreet” statements.


      “How can we tolerate such criminal propaganda?”—we read in
      an unsigned article of May 9 on the question of
      fraternisation. “Will this never be put a Stop to? Must we have
      a Napoleon? Must we be content with mere talk about iron
      discipline?” 


A delicate, a very delicate hint alluding to Kerensky’s
      notorious words about iron discipline.

Rech gives its readers a true and accurate picture of
      what is going on in “our” “new” government. We thank
      Rech from the bottom of our hearts for this
      truthfulness, which is exceptionally rare in such a newspaper
      and which has been called forth by exceptional
      circumstances.

In the “new” government Kerensky, supported by Chernov and
      Tsereteli, proclaims “iron discipline” for the army (in order to
      carry out the imperialist programme for an offensive).

And the landowners and capitalists, who have ten out of the
      sixteen posts in the cabinet, fume at Kerensky: “Must we be
      content with mere talk about iron discipline?” 

Is it not clear that this phrase is calculated to inspire
      Kerensky or some “suitable” general to take upon himself the role
      of a Napoleon, the role of a strangler of freedom, the role of
      an executioner of the workers?

Now that “socialists” have become members
      of the
cabinet,[1] things will be different, the defencists
      have been assuring us. It did not take more than a few days to
      reveal the falsity of these assurances.

We all know what indignation was aroused among the soldiers and
      workers by ex-Minister Milyukov’s statement that he had no
      intention of publishing the secret treaties which ex-Tsar
      Nicholas II had concluded with the British and French
      capitalists. And now, what does Mr. Tereshchenko, the
      new Minister of Foreign Affairs, the associate of
      Skobelev and Tsereteli, have to say on this question?

Tereshchenko admits that “this question [i.e., the secret
      treaties] arouses passions”. But what does he do to cool these
      passions? He simply repeats what Milyukov, who has just
      been deposed, said before him.

      “Immediate publication of the treaties would amount to a break
      with the Allies,” Tereshchenko declared in a statement to the
      press.

And the “socialist” ministers are silent and condone the system
      of secret diplomacy.

The coalition cabinet has brought no changes. The tsars secret
      treaties remain sacred to it.

And you, gentlemen, want this not to “arouse passions”? What do
      you take the class-conscious workers and soldiers for? Or do you
      really regard them as “rebellious slaves”?

Today’s Izvestia carries a report of the
      meeting of the Soldiers’ Section of the Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies. This meeting, among other things,



      “considered the question of whether soldiers could perform
      the duties of militiamen. The Executive Committee proposed
      to the meeting a resolution to the following effect:


      “In view of the fact that soldiers must perform their
      direct duty, the Executive Committee of the Soviet of
      Soldiers’ Deputies declared against the soldiers’
      participation in the militia, and proposes that all
      soldiers serving in the militia be immediately returned to
      their units.’

      “After a brief debate, the resolution was passed with an
      amendment permitting soldiers discharged from
      active service as well as wounded soldiers to
      perform militia duties.” 


It is to be regretted that the exact texts of the resolution and
      the amendment have not been published. More regrettable still is
      the fact that the Executive Committee proposed and the meeting
      adopted a resolution which is a complete abandonment of the
      fundamental principles of democracy.

There is hardly a democratic party in Russia that does not
      include in its programme a demand for the universal arming of
      the people as a substitute for the standing army. There is
      hardly a Socialist-Revolutionary or a Menshevik Social-Democrat
      who would dare oppose such a demand. The trouble is that it has
      become a “custom” “nowadays”, under the cover of high-sounding
      phrases about ’revolutionary democracy”, to accept democratic
      (the more so socialist) programmes “in principle”, but reject
      them in practice.

To oppose the participation of soldiers in the militia on the
      ground that “soldiers must perform their direct duty” is to
      forget completely the principles of democracy and

    

involuntarily,
      unconsciously, perhaps, to adopt the idea of a standing
      army. The soldier is a professional; his direct duty is
      not social service at all—such is the point of
      view of those who are for a standing army. It is not a
      democratic point of view. It is the point of view of the
      Napoleons. It is the point of view of old supporters of the old
      regime and the capitalists, who dream of an easy transition
      backward, from a republic to a constitutional monarchy.

A democrat is opposed to such a view on principle. Soldiers’
      participation in the militia amounts to breaking down the wall
      that separates the army from the people. It amounts to breaking
      with the accursed “barrack” past where a special group of
      citizens, detached from and opposed to the people, were trained,
      “knocked into shape” and drilled for the “direct task” of
      following only a military profession. Soldiers’ participation in
      the militia is a cardinal issue involving the re-education of
      the “soldiers” into militiamen citizens, the re-education of the
      population into public-spirited armed citizens. Democracy will
      remain an idle deceitful phrase, or merely a half-measure,
      unless the entire people is given a chance immediately
      and unqualifiedly to learn how to handle arms. Without the
      systematic, regular, and wide spread participation of the
      soldiers in the militia this will be impossible.

The objection may be raised that soldiers should not be
      deflected from their direct duties. No one
      said they should. To make a point of this is as ridiculous as
      saying that a physician engaged at the bedside of a patient who
      is dangerously ill has no right to leave that bedside in order
      to go and hand in his voting-paper, or that a worker engaged in
      production, which admittedly must not be interrupted, has no
      right to go away to exercise his political rights until he is
      relieved by another worker. Such arguments would simply he
      frivolous and even unscrupulous.

Participation in the militia is one of the cardinal and basic
      principles of democracy, one of the most important guarantees of
      freedom. (We might add, parenthetically, that there is no better
      way of enhancing the purely military strength and capacity of
      the army than by substituting the universal arming of the people
      for the standing army, and by using the soldiers to instruct the
      people; this method has always been

    

used and always will be used
      in every truly revolutionary war.) The immediate, unqualified,
      universal organisation of a people’s militia and the widest
      participation of soldiers in that militia are in the vital
      interests of the workers, peas ants, and soldiers, that is to
      say, the vast majority of the population, a majority that is not
      interested in safeguarding the profits of the landowners and the
      capitalists.

Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet published today the
      Executive Committee’s “Terms of Reference” for the organisation
      of a commission for convening an international conference. Our
      Party, among others, is asked to send a representative to the
      commission. Needless to say, our Party will take no part either
      in the commission or in any joint conference with so-called
      socialist ministers who have gone over to their
      bourgeoisie. This should be well known to anyone who has taken
      any interest in our Party, or who has read our resolution
      concerning the state of affairs in the International.

Our Party’s Central Committee unanimously decided a few days ago
      to send a delegate to the forthcoming Zimmerwald Conference with
      instructions to immediately walk out of that Conference and
      withdraw from the Zimmerwald
      group in the event of the Conference declaring in favour of
      any association or joint discussion with the social-chauvinists.

Lenin set forth the Bolsheviks’ views on the war, on peace, and
      the coalition government.

In the first part of his speech Lenin briefly stated the reasons
      for his journey via Germany, then passed on to the war and made
      clear its predatory nature. He then dwelt on the question of how
      to end the war and developed the idea that the only way of doing
      this was by an alliance of the workers of all the belligerent
      countries.

Lenin next dealt with the question as to what stood in the way
      of such an alliance and outlined the road by which such an
      alliance of the workers could and should be achieved.


The way to this was not by an agreement between the workers and
      the capitalists, and between the soldier-peasants and the
      landowners, but by a struggle of the workers and peasants
      against their oppressors.

The coalition government was an agreement between the socialists
      and the capitalists, it meant suppression of the revolution.

Seizure of power by the workers and the peasants could solve our
      country’s most pressing problems for her—the problem of the
      land, of its transfer to the peasants, and other questions
      connected with the war, such as food supply, improving the
      condition of the workers, etc.

Our Party is going to the polls with its own lists of
      candidates. According to preliminary reports received by the
      Secretariat of the Central Committee these lists have been made
      up without any blocs in 4 out of 12 districts (Moskovsky,
      Rozhdestvenskoye, Kolpino, and Porokhovo districts). In all the
      other districts we are forming blocs only with the
      internationalists, specifically, in 6 districts (Vtoroi
      Gorodskoi, Narvsky, Petrogradkaya Storona, Moskovsky, Pervy
      Goredskoi and Vasilyevsky Ostrov districts) with the
“Inter-District”
      Organisation[1] (who, as we know, have most emphatically
      condemned the Narodniks and Mensheviks for joining the
      capitalist cabinet); in 4 districts (Vyborgsky, Nevsky, Pervy
      Gorodskoi and Vasilyevsky Ostrov districts) with the
      internationalist Mensheviks opposed to “socialist”
      ministerialism[2]; and in 1 district (Nevsky) with
      internationalists from the Socialist—Revolutionary Party,
      who condemn their party’s “ministerialism”. 

This co-operation with internationalists from other parties is
      fully in keeping with the decisions of our conferences (the
      Petrograd and the All-Russia conferences) and with the basic
      policy of the proletarian party aimed against petty-bourgeois
      defencism and Menshevik and Narodnik in
      misterialism.

The “Left bloc” propaganda, carried on, among others, by
      Novaya Zhizn, obviously could not alter our Party’s
      decision. The view that the municipal elections “are not of such
      a pronounced political character” (as the elections to the

    

Constituent Assembly) is wrong, basically wrong. It is just as
      wrong to maintain that “the municipal programmes of the
      different socialist [?] parties differ very little from one an
      other”. To repeat such odd statements without answering
      Pravda’s arguments is to dodge an important issue or
      simply to haul down the flag.

To narrow the elections in the capital down to a purely (or even
      predominantly) “municipal” programme at a time of revolution is
      grotesquely ridiculous. It flies in the face of all
      revolutionary experience. It is an insult to the common sense of
      the workers, who know only too well that Petrograd’s is a
      leading role, sometimes a decisive one.

The Cadets unite all the Rights, the whole counter-revolution,
      all the landowners and capitalists. They support the government
      and want to see revolutionary Petrograd playing second fiddle to
      the government of the capitalists, who have ten ministers to the
      Narodniks’ and Mensheviks’ six.

Opposed to the Cadets, the chauvinists, the supporters of war
      for the Straits, there is the party of the proletariat, which,
      definitely hostile as it is to imperialism, is the only party
      capable of breaking with the interests of Capital and
      implementing serious revolutionary measures, without which it is
      impossible to help the working masses at a moment of
      imminent catastrophe of gigantic proportions. Without
      revolutionary measures there can be no
      salvation. Without a workers’ militia as a step towards the
      immediate creation of a people’s militia, it is
      impossible, even with the best will in the world, to
      carry out such measures, in particular to do away with queues
      and the disorganisation in the matter of food supply.

As for the middle-of-the-road line taken by the petty
      bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Narodniks, who proclaim good
      intentions and weaken themselves by making a deal with and
      submitting to the capitalists (6 ministers against
      10!)—this line is a dead thing. The masses will soon learn
      this from experience, even if they do, for a time, believe in
      “agreements” with the capitalists.

All those who really stand for the interests of the working
      masses, for doing away with the police and having it

    

replaced by
      a people’s militia, all those who stand for serious
      revolutionary measures to cope with the crisis and save the
      country from an unprecedented debacle, should vote for the lists
      of candidates of the proletarian party—the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks).

The statements dealing with the possible victory of a chauvinist
      (defencist) revolution are of particular
      interest. Sotsial-Demokrat, the Central Organ of the
      Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party published in Geneva under
      the editorship of Zinoviev and Lenin, carried the following
      statement of its editors in its issue No. 47 for October 13,
      1915:

      “(8) By revolutionary chauvinists we mean those who want a
      victory over tsarism so as to achieve victory over Germany,
      plunder other countries, consolidate Great-Russian rule over the
      other peoples of Russia, etc. Revolutionary chauvinism is based
      on the class position of the petty bourgeoisie. The latter
      always vacillates between the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat. At present it is vacillating between chauvinism
      (which prevents it from being consistently revolutionary, even
      within the meaning of a democratic revolution) and proletarian
      internationalism. At the moment the Trudoviks, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, Nasha
      Zarya,[2] Chkheidze’s
      Duma
group,[3] the Organising Committee, Mr. Plekhanov and the
      like are political spokesmen for this petty bourgeoisie in
      Russia.

      “(9) If the revolutionary chauvinists won in Russia, we would be
      opposed to a defence of their ‘fatherland’ in the
      present war. Our slogan is: against the chauvinists, even if
      they are revolutionary end republican—against them, and
      for an alliance of the international proletariat for
      the socialist revolution.

      “(10) To the question of whether it is possible for the
      proletariat to assume the leadership in the bourgeois Russian
      revolution, our answer is: yes, it is possible, if the
      petty

    

bourgeoisie swings to the left at the decisive moment; it
      is being pushed to the left, not only by our propaganda, but by
      a number of objective factors, economic, financial (the burden
      of war), military, political, and others.

      “(11) To the question of what the party of the proletariat would
      do if the revolution placed power in its hands in the present
      war, our answer is as follows: we would propose peace to
      all the belligerents on the condition that freedom is
      given to the colonies and all peoples that are
      dependent, oppressed and deprived of rights. Under the present
      governments, neither Germany nor Britain and France would accept
      this condition. In that case, we would have to prepare for and
      wage a revolutionary war, i.e., not only resolutely carry out
      the whole of our minimum programme, but work systematically to
      bring about an uprising among all peoples now oppressed by the
      Great Russians, all colonies and dependent countries in Asia
      (India, China, Persia, etc.), and also, first and foremost, we
      would raise up the socialist proletariat of Europe for an
      insurrection against their governments and despite the
      social-chauvinists. There is no doubt that a victory of the
      proletariat in Russia would create extraordinarily favourable
      conditions for the development of the revolution in both Asia
      and Europe. Even 1905 proved that. The international
      solidarity of the revolutionary proletariat is a fact,
      despite the scum of opportunism and
social-chauvinism.”[1]

News, speculation, apprehensions and rumours of an impending
    disaster are becoming more and more frequent. The capitalist
    newspapers are trying to frighten people; they are fulminating
    against the Bolsheviks and making play of Kutler’s cryptic
    allusions to “a certain” factory, to “certain” factories, to “a
    certain” enterprise, and so forth. Peculiar methods, strange
    “proofs”. Why not name a definite factory? Why not give
    the public and the workers a chance to verify these
    rumours, which are deliberately calculated to excite alarm?

It should not be difficult for the capitalists to understand
      that by withholding the exact facts about definite specified
      factories they are only making themselves ridiculous. Why,
      gentlemen—you capitalists are the government, you have ten
      out of the sixteen ministers, you bear the responsibility, you
      give the orders. Is it not ridiculous that people who run the
      government, people who have a majority in it, should confine
      themselves to Kutler’s anonymous references, should be afraid to
      come out in the open and should try to shift responsibility to
      other parties that are not at the helm of the state?

The newspapers of the petty-bourgeois parties, the Narodniks and
      Mensheviks, are also complaining, though in a somewhat different
      tone. They do not so much level accusations against the terrible
      Bolsheviks (that, of course, is all in the day’s work) as heap
      one good wish upon another. Most typical in this respect is
      Izvestia, which is run by a bloc of the two above-named
      parties. In its issue No. 63 for May 11 are two articles on the
      subject of combating economic chaos. The articles are identical
      in character. One of them,

    

to put it mildly, is injudiciously
      headed (altogether as “injudicious” as the very fact of the
      Narodniks and Mensheviks joining the imperialist cabinet): “What
      Does the Provisional Government Want?” It would have been more
      correct to say: “What the Provisional Government Does
      Not Want and What It Promises.” 

The other article is a “resolution of the Economic Department of
      the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies”. Here are some quotations from it, best illustrative
      of its contents:


      “Many branches of industry are ripe for a state trade monopoly
      (grain, meat, salt, leather), others are ripe for the
      organisation of state—controlled trusts (coal, oil,
      metallurgy, sugar, paper); and, finally, present conditions
      demand in the case of nearly all branches of industry state
      control of the distribution of raw materials and manufactures,
      as well as price filing... Simultaneously, it is necessary to
      place all banking institutions under state and public control in
      order to combat speculation in goods subject to state
      control.... At the same time, the most energetic measures should
      be taken against the workshy, even if labour conscription has to
      be introduced for that purpose.... The country is already in a
      state of catastrophe, and the only thing that can save it is the
      creative effort of the whole nation headed by a
      government which has consciously shouldered [ahem! ahem!]
      the stupendous task of rescuing a country ruined by war and the
      tsarist regime.” 


With the exception of the last phrase beginning with the words
      we have italicised, a phrase which with purely philistine
      credulity places on the “shoulders” of the capitalists tasks
      they are incapable of fulfilling, the programme is an excel lent
      one. ’We have here control, state-controlled trusts, the
      combating of speculation, labour conscription—in what way
      does this differ from “terrible” Bolshevism, what more could
      these “terrible” Bolsheviks want?

That is just the point, that is the crux of the matter, that is
      just what petty bourgeois and philistines of all shades and
      colours stubbornly refuse to see. They are forced to
      accept the programme of “terrible” Bolshevism, because no other
      programme offers a way out of the really calamitous debacle that
      is impending. But—there is this but—the capitalists
      “accept” this programme (see the famous section 3 of the
      declaration of the “new” Provisional
Government[1]) in order
      not to carry it out. And the Narodniks and Mensheviks trust
      the capitalists, and encourage the people to share this

    

fatal
      trust. That is the sum and substance of the political
      situation.

Control over the trusts, with publication of their full reports,
      with immediate conferences of their employees, with the
      unqualified participation in this control of the workers
      themselves, with independent control on the part of
      representatives of every important political party—all this
      can be introduced by decree which can be drafted in a single
      day.

What is the difficulty then, Citizens Shingaryovs,
      Tereshchenkos, Konovalovs? What is stopping you, citizens,
      near-socialist ministers Chernov and Tsereteli? What is stopping
      you, Citizens Narodnik and Menshevik leaders of the Executive
      Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies?

Neither we nor anybody else could have proposed anything but the
      immediate establishment of such control over the
      trusts, banks, trade, food supply, and the workshy (a
      surprisingly good word to come from the pen of the
      Izvestia editors!). Nothing better could be devised
      than “the creative effort of the whole nation”. 

Only we must not trust the word of the capitalists; we must not
      believe the naive (at best, naive) hope of the Mensheviks and
      Narodniks that the capitalists can establish such control.

A debacle is impending. Disaster is imminent. The capitalists
      are heading all countries to destruction. There is only one way
      out: revolutionary discipline, revolutionary measures by the
      revolutionary class, the proletarians and semi
      proletarians, the transfer of all power in the state to that
      class, a class that is really capable of instituting such
      control, that is able to cope effectively with the
      “workshy”.

The question of war and
 revolution has been dealt with so often lately in the press and at
 every public meeting that probably many of you are not only
 familiar with many aspects of the question but have come to find
 them tedious. I have not yet had a single opportunity to address
 or even attend any Party or for that matter any public meetings in
 this district, and therefore I run the risk, perhaps, of
 repetition or of not dealing in sufficient detail with those
 aspects of the question that interest you most.

It seems to me that the most important thing that is usually overlooked
 in the question of the war, a key issue to which insufficient attention
 is paid and over which there is so much dispute useless, hopeless, idle
 dispute, I should say is the question of the class character of the war:
 what caused that war, what classes are waging it, and what historical and
 historico-economic conditions gave rise to it. As far as I have been able
 to follow the way the question of the war is dealt with at public and Party
 meetings, I have come to the conclusion that the reason why there is so
 much misunderstanding on the subject is because, all too often, when dealing
 with the question of the war, we speak in entirely different languages.

From the point of view of Marxism, that is, of modern scientific socialism,
the main issue in any discussion by socialists on how to assess the war
and what attitude to adopt towards it is this: what is the war being waged
for, and what classes staged and directed it. We Marxists do not belong
to that category of people who are unqualified opponents of all war. We
say: our aim is to achieve a socialist

    

system of society, which, by eliminating
the division of mankind into classes, by eliminating all exploitation of
man by man and nation by nation, will inevitably eliminate the very possibility
of war. But in the war to win that socialist system of society we are bound
to encounter conditions under which the class struggle within each given
nation may come up against a war between the different nations, a war conditioned
by this very class struggle. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility
of revolutionary wars, i.e., wars arising from the class struggle, wars
waged by revolutionary classes, wars which are of direct and immediate
revolutionary significance. Still less can we rule this out when we remember
that though the history of European revolutions during the last century,
in the course of 125–135 years, say, gave us wars which were mostly reactionary,
it also gave us revolutionary wars, such as the war of the French revolutionary
masses against a united monarchist, backward, feudal and semi-feudal Europe.
No deception of the masses is more widespread today in Western Europe,
and latterly here in Russia, too, than that which is practised by citing
the example of revolutionary wars. There are wars and wars. We must be
clear as to what historical conditions have given rise to the war, what
classes are waging it, and for what ends. Unless we grasp this, all our
talk about the war will necessarily be utterly futile, engendering more
heat than light. That is why I take the liberty, seeing that you have chosen
war and revolution as the subject of today’s talk, to deal with this aspect
of the matter at greater length.

We all know the dictum of Clausewitz, one of the most famous writers
on the philosophy and history of war, which says: “War is a continuation
of policy by other
means.”[4] This dictum comes from a
writer[See Clausewitz, On War, Vol. 1]
who reviewed
the history of wars and drew philosophic lessons from it shortly after
the period of the Napoleonic wars. This writer, whose basic views are now
undoubtedly familiar to every thinking person, nearly eighty years ago
challenged the ignorant man-in-the-street conception of war as being a
thing apart from the policies of the governments and classes concerned,
as being a simple attack that disturbs the peace, and is then followed
by restoration of the peace thus disturbed, as much as to say: “They had
a fight, then they made up!” This is a

    

grossly ignorant view, one that
was repudiated scores of years ago and is repudiated by any more or less
careful analysis of any historical epoch of wars.

War is a continuation of policy by other means. All wars are inseparable
from the political systems that engender them. The policy which a given
state, a given class within that state, pursued for a long time before
the war is inevitably continued by that same class during the war, the
form of action alone being changed.

War is a continuation of policy by other means. When the French revolutionary
townspeople and revolutionary peasants overthrew the monarchy at the close
of the eighteenth century by revolutionary means and established a democratic
republic when they made short work of their monarch, and short work of
their landowners, too, in a revolutionary fashion that policy of the revolutionary
class was bound to shake all the rest of autocratic, tsarist, imperial,
and semi-feudal Europe to its foundations. And the inevitable continuation
of this policy of the victorious revolutionary class in France was the
wars in which all the monarchist nations of Europe, forming their famous
coalition, lined up against revolutionary France in a counter-revolutionary
war. Just as within the country the revolutionary people of France had
then, for the first time, displayed revolutionary energy on a scale it
had never shown for centuries, so in the war at the close of the eighteenth
century it revealed a similar gigantic revolutionary creativeness when
it remodelled its whole system of strategy, broke with all the old rules
and traditions of warfare, replaced the old troops with a new revolutionary
people’s army, and created new methods of warfare. This example, to my
mind, is noteworthy in that it clearly demonstrates to us things which
the bourgeois journalists are now always forgetting when they pander to
the philistine prejudices and ignorance of the backward masses who do not
understand this intimate economic and historical connection between every
kind of war and the preceding policy of every country, every class that
ruled before the war and achieved its ends by so-called “peaceful” means.
So-called, because the brute force required to ensure “peaceful” rule in
the colonies, for example, can hardly be called peaceful.

 
Peace reigned in Europe, but this was because domination over hundreds
of millions of people in the colonies by the European nations was sustained
only through constant, incessant, interminable wars, which we Europeans
do not regard as wars at all, since all too often they resembled, not wars,
but brutal massacres, the wholesale slaughter of unarmed peoples. The thing
is that if we want to know what the present war is about we must first
of all make a general survey of the policies of the European powers as
a whole. We must not take this or that example, this or that particular
case, which can easily be wrenched out of the context of social phenomena
and which is worthless, because an opposite example can just as easily
be cited. We must take the whole policy of the entire system of European
states in their economic and political interrelations if we are to understand
how the present war steadily and inevitably grew out of this system.

We are constantly witnessing attempts, especially on the part of the
capitalist press whether monarchist or republican to read into the present
war an historical meaning which it does not possess. For example, no device
is more frequently resorted to in the French Republic than that of presenting
this war on France’s part as a continuation and counterpart of the wars
of the Great French Revolution of 1792. No device for hoodwinking the French
masses, the French workers and the workers of all countries is more widespread
than that of applying to our epoch the “jargon” of that other epoch and
some of its watchwords, or the attempt to present matters as though now,
too, republican France is defending her liberty against the monarchy. One
“minor” fact overlooked is that then, in 1792, war was waged in France
by a revolutionary class, which had carried out an unparalleled revolution
and displayed unmatched heroism in utterly destroying the French monarchy
and rising against a united monarchist Europe with the sole and single
aim of carrying on its revolutionary struggle.

The war in France was a continuation of the policy of the revolutionary
class which had carried out the revolution, won the republic, settled accounts
with the French capitalists and landowners with unprecedented vigour, and
was waging a revolutionary war against a united monarchist Europe in continuation
of that policy.

 
What we have at present is primarily two leagues, two groups of capitalist
powers. We have before us all the world’s greatest capitalist powers Britain,
France, America, and Germany who for decades have doggedly pursued a policy
of incessant economic rivalry aimed at achieving world supremacy, subjugating
the small nations, and making threefold and tenfold profits on banking
capital, which has caught the whole world in the net of its influence.
That is what Britain’s and Germany’s policies really amount to. I stress
this fact. This fact can never be emphasised strongly enough, because if
we forget this we shall never understand what this war is about, and we
shall then be easy game for any bourgeois publicist who tries to foist
lying phrases on us.

The real policies of the two groups of capitalist giants Britain and
Germany, who, with their respective allies, have taken the field against
each other policies which they were pursuing for decades before the war,
should be studied and grasped in their entirety. If we did not do this
we should not only be neglecting an essential requirement of scientific
socialism and of all social science in general, but we should be unable
to understand anything whatever about the present war. We should be putting
ourselves in the power of Milyukov, that deceiver, who is stirring up chauvinism
and hatred of one nation for another by methods which are applied everywhere
without exception, methods which Clausewitz wrote about eighty years ago
when he ridiculed the very view some people are holding today, namely,
that the nations lived in peace and then they started fighting. As if this
were true! How can a war be accounted for without considering its bearing
on the preceding policy of the given state, of the given system of states,
the given classes? I repeat: this is a basic point which is constantly
overlooked. Failure to understand it makes nine-tenths of all war discussions
mere wrangling, so much verbiage. We say: if you have not studied the policies
of both belligerent groups over a period of decades so as to avoid accidental
factors and the quoting of random examples if you have not shown what bearing
this war has on preceding policies, then you don’t understand what this
war is all about.

These policies show us just one thing continuous economic rivalry between
the world’s two greatest giants, capitalist

    

economies. On the one hand
we have Britain, a country which owns the greater part of the globe, a
country which ranks first in wealth, which has created this wealth not
so much by the labour of its workers as by the exploitation of innumerable
colonies, by the vast power of its banks which have developed at the head
of all the others into an insignificantly small group of some four or five
super-banks handling billions of rubles, and handling them in such a way
that it can he said without exaggeration that there is not a patch of land
in the world today on which this capital has not laid its heavy hand, not
a patch of land which British capital has not enmeshed by a thousand threads.
This capital grew to such dimensions by the turn of the century that its
activities extended far beyond the borders of individual states and formed
a group of giant banks possessed of fabulous wealth. Having begotten this
tiny group of banks, it has caught the whole world in the net of its billions.
This is the sum and substance of Britain’s economic policy and of the economic
policy of France, of which even French writers, some of them contributors
to
L’Humanité,[5]
a paper now controlled by ex-socialists (in fact, no less a man
than Lysis, the well-known financial writer), stated several
 years before the war: “France is a financial monarchy, France is
 a financial oligarchy, France is the world’s money-lender.”

On the other hand, opposed to this, mainly Anglo-French group, we have
another group of capitalists, an even more rapacious, even more predatory
one, a group who came to the capitalist banqueting table when all the seats
were occupied, but who introduced into the struggle new methods for developing
capitalist production, improved techniques, and superior organisation,
which turned the old capitalism, the capitalism of the free-competition
age, into the capitalism of giant trusts, syndicates, and cartels. This
group introduced the beginnings of state-controlled capitalist production,
combining the colossal power of capitalism with the colossal power of the
state into a single mechanism and bringing tens of millions of people within
the single organisation of state capitalism. Here is economic history,
here is diplomatic history, covering several decades, from which no one
can get away. It is the one and only guide-post to a proper solution of
the problem of war; it leads you to the

    

conclusion that the present war,
too, is the outcome of the policies of the classes who have come to grips
in it, of the two supreme giants, who, long before the war, had caught
the whole world, all countries, in the net of financial exploitation and
economically divided the globe up among themselves. They were bound to
clash, because a redivision of this supremacy, from the point of view of
capitalism, had become inevitable.

The old division was based on the fact that Britain, in the course of
several centuries, had ruined her former competitors. A former competitor
was Holland, which had dominated the whole world. Another was France, which
had fought for supremacy for nearly a hundred years. After a series of
protracted wars Britain was able, by virtue of her economic power, her
merchant capital, to establish her unchallenged sway over the world. In
1871 a new predator appeared, a new capitalist power arose, which developed
at an incomparably faster pace than Britain. That is a basic fact. You
will not find a book on economic history that does not acknowledge this
indisputable fact the fact of Germany’s faster development. This rapid
development of capitalism in Germany was the development of a young strong
predator, who appeared in the concert of European powers and said: “You
ruined Holland, you defeated France, you have helped yourself to half the
world now be good enough to let us have our fair share.” What does “a fair
share” mean? How is it to be determined in the capitalist world, in the
world of banks? There power is determined by the number of banks, there
power is determined in the way described by a mouthpiece of the American
multimillionaires, which declared with typically American frankness and
typically American cynicism: “The war in Europe is being waged for world
domination. To dominate the world two things are needed: dollars and banks.
We have the dollars, we shall make the banks and we shall dominate the
world.” This statement was made by a leading newspaper of the American
multimillionaires. I must say, there is a thousand times more truth in
this cynical statement of a blustering American multimillionaire than in
thousands of articles by bourgeois liars who try to make out that this
war is being waged for national interests, on national issues, and utter
similar glaringly

    

patent lies which dismiss history completely and take
an isolated example like the case of the German beast of prey who attacked
Belgium. The case is undoubtedly a real one. This group of predators did
attack Belgium with brutal ferocity, but it did the same thing the other
group did yesterday by other means and is doing today to other nations.

When we argue about annexations and this bears on the question I have
been trying briefly to explain to you as the history of the economic and
diplomatic relations which led up to the present war when we argue about
annexations we always forget that these, generally, are what the war is
being waged for; it is for the carve-up of conquered territories, or, to
put it more popularly, for the division of the plundered spoils by the
two robber gangs. When we argue about annexations we constantly meet with
methods which, scientifically speaking, do not stand up to criticism, and
which, as methods of public journalism, are deliberate humbug. Ask a Russian
chauvinist or social-chauvinist what annexation by Germany means, and he
will give you an excellent explanation, because he understands that perfectly
well. But he will never answer a request for a general definition of annexation
that will fit them all Germany, Britain, and Russia. He will never do that!
And when Rech (to pass from theory to practice) sneered at Pravda,
saying, “These Pravdists consider Kurland a case of annexation! How can
you talk to such people!” and we answered: “Please give us such a definition
of annexation as would apply to the Germans, the English, and the Russians,
and we add that either you evade this issue or we shall expose you on the
spot”[1]

—Rech

kept silent. We maintain that no newspaper, either of
the chauvinists in general, who simply say that the fatherland must be
defended, or of the social-chauvinists, has ever given a definition of
annexation that would fit both Germany and Russia, that would be applicable
to any side. It cannot do this for the simple reason that this war is the
continuation of a policy of annexations, that is, a policy of conquest,
of capitalist robbery on the part of both groups involved in the war. Obviously,
the question of which of these two robbers was the first to draw the knife
is of small account

    

to us. Take the history of the naval and military expenditures
of these two groups over a period of decades, take the history of the little
wars they waged before the big war “little” because few Europeans died
in those wars, whereas hundreds of thousands of people belonging to the
nations they were subjugating died in them, nations which from their point
of view could not be regarded as nations at all (you couldn’t very well
call those Asians and Africans nations!); the wars waged against these
nations were wars against unarmed people, who were simply shot down, machine-gunned.
Can you call them wars? Strictly speaking, they were not wars at all, and
you could forget about them. That is their attitude to this downright deception
of the masses.

The present war is a continuation of the policy of conquest, of the
shooting down of whole nationalities, of unbelievable atrocities committed
by the Germans and the British in Africa, and by the British and the Russians
in Persia which of them committed most it is difficult to say. It was for
this reason that the German capitalists looked upon them as their enemies.
Ah, they said, you are strong because you are rich? But we are stronger,
therefore we have the same “sacred” right to plunder. That is what the
real history of British and German finance capital in the course of several
decades preceding the war amounts to. That is what the history of Russo-German,
Russo-British, and German-British relations amounts to. There you have
the clue to an understanding of what the war is about. That is why the
story that is current about the cause of the war is sheer duplicity and
humbug. Forgetting the history of finance capital, the history of how this
war had been brewing over the issue of redivision, they present the matter
like this: two nations were living at peace, then one attacked the other,
and the other fought back. All science, all banks are forgotten, and the
peoples are told to take up arms, and so are the peasants, who know nothing
about politics. All they have to do is to fight back! The logical thing,
following this line of argument, would be to close down all newspapers,
burn all books and ban all mention of annexations in the newspapers. In
this way such a view of annexations could be justified. They can’t tell
the truth about annexations because the whole history of Russia,

    

Britain,
and Germany has been one of continuous, ruthless and sanguinary war over
annexations. Ruthless wars were waged in Persia and Africa by the Liberals,
who flogged political offenders in India for daring to put forward demands
which were being fought for here in Russia. The French colonial troops
oppressed peoples too. There you have the pre-history, the real history
of unprecedented plunder! Such is the policy of these classes, of which
the present war is a continuation. That is why, on the question of annexations,
they cannot give the reply that we give, when we say that any nation joined
to another one, not by the voluntary choice of its majority but by a decision
of a king or government, is an annexed nation. To renounce annexation is
to give each nation the right to form a separate state or to live in union
with whomsoever it chooses. An answer like that is perfectly clear to every
worker who is at all class-conscious.

In every resolution, of which dozens are passed, and published even
in such a paper as
Zemlya
i
Volya,[6] you will find the answer, poorly
expressed: We don’t want a war for supremacy over other nations, we are
fighting for our freedom. That is what all the workers and peasants say,
that is how they express the view of the workingman, his understanding
of the war. They imply by this that if the war were in the interests of
the working people against the exploiters they would be for such a war.
So would we, and there is not a revolutionary party that could be against
it. Where they go wrong, these movers of numerous resolutions, is when
they believe that the war is being waged by them. We soldiers, we workers,
we peasants are fighting for our freedom. I shall never forget the question
one of them asked me after a meeting. “Why do you speak against the capitalists
all the time?” he said. “I’m not a capitalist, am I? We’re workers, we
are defending our freedom.” You’re wrong, you are fighting because you
are obeying your capitalist government; it’s the governments, not the peoples,
who are carrying on this war. I am not surprised at a worker or peasant,
who doesn’t know his politics, who has not had the good or bad fortune
of being initiated into the secrets of diplomacy or the picture of this
finance plunder (this oppression of Persia by Russia and Britain, say)
I am not surprised at him forgetting this history and saying naïvely: Who
cares about the capitalists,

when it’s me who’s fighting! He doesn’t understand
the connection between the war and the government, he doesn’t understand
that the war is being waged by the government, and that he is just a tool
in the hands of that government. He can call himself a revolutionary people
and write eloquent resolutions to Russians this means a lot, because this
has come into their lives only recently. There has recently appeared a
“revolutionary” declaration by the Provisional Government. This doesn’t
mean anything. Other nations, more experienced than we are in the capitalist
art of hoodwinking the masses by penning “revolutionary” manifestos, have
long since broken all the world’s records in this respect. If you take
the parliamentary history of the French Republic since it became a republic
supporting tsarism, you will find dozens of examples during the decades
of this history when manifestos full of the most eloquent phrases served
to mask a policy of the most outrageous colonial and financial plunder.
The whole history of the Third Republic in France is a history of this
plunder. Such are the origins of the present war. It is not due to malice
on the part of capitalists or the mistaken policy of some monarch. To think
so would be incorrect. No, this war is an inevitable outgrowth of supercapitalism,
especially banking capital, which resulted in some four banks in Berlin
and five or six in London dominating the whole world, appropriating the
world’s funds, reinforcing their financial policy by armed force, and finally
clashing in a savage armed conflict because they had come to the end of
their free tether in the matter of conquests. One or the other side had
to relinquish its colonies. Such questions are not settled voluntarily
in this world of capitalists. This issue could only be settled by war.
That is why it is absurd to blame one or another crowned brigand. They
are all the same, these crowned brigands. That is why it is equally absurd
to blame the capitalists of one or another country. All they are to blame
for is for having introduced such a system. But this has been done in full
keeping with the law, which is safeguarded by all the forces of a civilised
state. “I am fully within my rights, I am a buyer of shares. All the law
courts, all the police, the whole standing army and all the navies in the
world are safeguarding my sacred right to these shares.” Who’s to blame
for banks being set

    

up which handle hundreds of millions of rubles, for
these banks casting their nets of plunder over the whole world, and for
their being locked in mortal combat? Find the culprit if you can! The blame
lies with half a century of capitalist development, and the only way out
of this is by the overthrow of the rule of the capitalists and by a workers’
revolution. That is the answer our Party has arrived at from an analysis
of the war, and that is why we say: the very simple question of annexations
has been so muddled up and the spokesmen of the bourgeois parties have
uttered so many lies that they are able to make out that Kurland is not
annexation by Russia. They have shared Kurland and Poland between them,
those three crowned brigands. They have been doing this for a hundred years,
carving up the living flesh. And the Russian brigand snatched most because
he was then the strongest. And now that the young beast of prey, Germany,
who was then a party to the carve-up, has grown into a strong capitalist
power, she demands a redivision. You want things to stay as they were?
she says. You think you are stronger? Let’s try conclusions!

That is what the war boils down to. Of course, the challenge “let’s
try conclusions” is merely an expression of the decade-long policy of plunder,
the policy of the big banks. That is why no one but we can tell this truth
about annexations, a simple truth that every worker and peasant will understand.
That is why the question of treaties, such a simple question, is deliberately
and disgracefully confused by the whole press. You say that we have a revolutionary
government, that there are ministers in that government who are well-nigh
socialists Narodniks and Mensheviks. But when they make declarations about
peace without annexations, on condition that this term is not defined (because
it means taking away German annexations and keeping our own), then we say:
Of what value are your “revolutionary” cabinet, your declarations, your
statements that you are not out for a war of conquest, if at the same time
you tell the army to take the offensive? Don’t you know that we have treaties,
that these treaties were concluded by Nicholas the Bloody in the most predatory
fashion? You don’t know it? It is pardonable for the workers or peasants
not to know that. They did not plunder, they read no clever books. But
when

    

educated Cadets preach this sort of stuff they know perfectly well
what these treaties are about. Although they are “secret” treaties, the
whole diplomatic press in all countries talks about them, saying: “You’ll
get the Straits, you’ll get Armenia, you’ll get Galicia, you’ll get Alsace-Lorraine,
you’ll get Trieste, and we’ll make a final carve-up of Persia.” And the
German capitalist says: “I’ll seize Egypt, I’ll subjugate the European
nations unless you return my colonies to me with interest.” Shares are
things that can’t do without interest. That is why the question of treaties,
itself a clear, simple question, has touched off such a torrent of barefaced
outrageous lies as those that are now pouring from the pages of all the
capitalist newspapers.

Take today’s paper Dyen. Vodovozov, a man absolutely innocent
of Bolshevism, but who is an honest democrat, states in it: I am opposed
to secret treaties; let me say this about the treaty with Rumania. There
is a secret treaty with Rumania and it says that Rumania will receive
a number of foreign peoples if she fights on the side of the Allies. The
treaties which the other Allies have are all the same. They wouldn’t have
started to subjugate nations if they had not had these treaties. To know
their contents you do not have to burrow in special journals. It is sufficient
to recollect the basic facts of economic and diplomatic history. For decades
Austria has been after the Balkans with an eye to subjugation. And if they
have clashed it is because they couldn’t help clashing. That is why, when
the masses demand that these treaties should be published, a demand that
is growing more insistent every day, ex-Minister Milyukov and the present
Minister Tereshchenko (one in a government without socialist ministers,
the other in a government with a number of near-socialist ministers) declare
that publication of the treaties would mean a break with the Allies.

Obviously, you can’t publish the treaties because you are all participants
in the same gang of robbers. We agree with Milyukov and Tereshchenko that
the treaties cannot be published. Two different conclusions can be drawn
from this. If we agree with Milyukov and Tereshchenko that the treaties
cannot be published what follows from this? If the treaties cannot be published,
then we’ve got to help the

    

capitalist ministers continue the war. The other
conclusion is this: since the capitalists cannot publish the treaties themselves,
then the capitalists have got to be overthrown. Which of these two conclusions
you consider to be correct, I leave it to you to decide, but be sure to
consider the consequences. If we reason the way the Narodnik and Menshevik
ministers reason, we come to this: once the government says that the treaties
cannot be published, then we must issue a new manifesto. Paper is not so
dear yet that we cannot write new manifestos. We shall write a new manifesto
and start an offensive. What for? With what aims? Who is to set these aims?
The soldiers are called upon to carry out the predatory treaties with Rumania
and France. Send Vodovozov’s article to the front and then complain that
this is all the Bolsheviks’ doing, the Bolsheviks must have invented this
treaty-with-Rumania business. In that case you would not only have to make
life a hell for Pravda, but even kick Vodovozov out for having studied
history. You would have to make a bonfire of all Milyukov’s books terribly
dangerous books those. Just open any book by the leader of the party of
“people’s freedom”, by this ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs. They are good
books. What do they say? They say that Russia has “a right” to the Straits,
to Armenia, to Galicia, to Eastern Prussia. He has carved them all up,
and even appends a map. Not only the Bolsheviks and Vodovozov will have
to be sent to Siberia for writing such revolutionary articles, but Milyukov’s
books will have to be burnt too, because if you collected simple quotations
from these books today and sent them to the front, no inflammatory leaflet
would have such an inflammatory effect as this would have.

It remains for me now, according to the brief plan of this talk I have
sketched for myself, to touch on the question of “revolutionary defencism”.
I believe, after what I have had the honour of reporting to you, that I
may now be allowed to touch only briefly on this question.

By “revolutionary defencism” we mean vindication of the war on the plea
that, after all, we have made the revolution, after all, we are a revolutionary
people, a revolutionary democracy. But what answer do we give to that?
What revolution did we make? We overthrew Nicholas. The revolution

    

was
not so very difficult compared with one that would have overthrown the
whole class of landowners and capitalists. Who did the revolution put in
power? The landowners and capitalists the very same classes who have long
been in power in Europe. Revolutions like this occurred there a hundred
years ago. The Tereshchenkos, Milyukovs, and Konovalovs have been in power
there for a long time, and it doesn’t matter a bit whether they have a
civil list to pay their tsars or whether they do without this luxury. A
bank remains a bank, whether capital is invested in concessions by the
hundred or not; profits remain profits, be it in a republic or in a monarchy.
If any savage country dares to disobey our civilised Capital, which sets
up such splendid banks in the colonies, in Africa and Persia if any savage
nation should disobey our civilised bank, we send troops out who restore
culture, order, and civilisation, as
Lyakhov
did in
Persia,[7] and the French
“republican” troops did in Africa, where they exterminated peoples with
equal ferocity. What difference does it make? We have here the same “revolutionary
defencism”, displayed only by the unenlightened masses, who see no connection
between war and the government, who do not know that this policy is sanctioned
by treaties. The treaties have remained, the banks have remained, the concessions
have remained. In Russia the best men of their class are in the government,
but the nature of the war has not changed a bit because of this. The new
“revolutionary defencism” uses the great concept of revolution merely as
a cloak to cover up the dirty and bloody war waged for the sake of dirty
and outrageous treaties.

The Russian revolution has not altered the war, but it has created organisations
which exist in no other country and were seldom found in revolutions in
the West. Most of the revolutions were confined to the emergence of governments
of our Tereshchenko and Konovalov type, while the country remained passive
and disorganised. The Russian revolution has gone further than that. In
this we have the germ of hope that it may overcome the war. Besides the
government of “near-socialist” ministers, the government of imperialist
war, the government of offensive, a government tied up with Anglo-French
capital besides this government and independent of it we have all over
Russia a

    

network of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.
Here is a revolution which has not said its last word yet. Here is a revolution
which Western Europe, under similar conditions, has not known. Here are
organisations of those classes which really have no need for annexations,
which have not put millions in the banks, and which are probably not interested
in whether the Russian Colonel Lyakhov and the British Liberal ambassador
divided Persia properly or not. Here is the pledge of this revolution being
carried further, i.e., that the classes which have no interest in annexations,
and despite the fact that they put too much trust in the capitalist government,
despite the appalling muddle and appalling deception contained in the very
concept “revolutionary defencism”, despite the fact that they support the
war loan, support the government of imperialist war despite all this have
succeeded in creating organisations in which the mass of the oppressed
classes are represented. These are the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’,
and Peasants’ Deputies, which, in very many local areas in Russia, have
gone much further than the Petrograd Soviet in their revolutionary work.
It is only natural, because in Petrograd we have the central authority
of the capitalists.

And when Skobelev in his speech yesterday said: “We’ll take all the
profits, we’ll take 100 per cent,” he was just letting himself go with
ministerial élan. If you take today’s Rech you will see what
the response is to this passage in Skobelev’s speech. They write there:
“Why, this means starvation, death! One hundred per cent means all!” Minister
Skobelev goes farther than the most extreme Bolshevik. It’s slandering
the Bolsheviks to say that they are the extreme Left. Minister Skobelev
is much more “Left”. They called me all the ugly names they could think
of, saying that I wanted to take their last shirt from the capitalists.
At any rate, it was Shulgin who said: “Let them take our last shirt!” Imagine
a Bolshevik going up to Citizen Shulgin and wanting to take his shirt from
him. He could just as well and with greater justification accuse Minister
Skobelev of this. We never went as far as that. We never suggested taking
100 per cent of profits. Nevertheless, it is a valuable promise. If you
take the resolution of our Party you will see that we propose

    

there, only
in a more closely reasoned form, exactly what I have been proposing. Control
must be established over the banks, followed by a fair tax on
incomes.[2]

And nothing more! Skobelev suggests taking a hundred kopeks in the ruble.
We proposed and propose nothing of the sort. Skobelev doesn’t really mean
it, and if he does he would not be able to do it for the simple reason
that to promise such things while making friends with Tereshchenko and
Konovalov is somewhat ludicrous. You could take 80 or 90 per cent of a
millionaire’s income, but not arm in arm with such ministers. If the Soviets
had the power they would really take it, but not all of it they have no
need to. They would take the bulk of the income. No other state authority
could do that. Minister Skobelev may have the best of intentions. I have
known those parties for several decades I have been in the revolutionary
movement for thirty years. I am the last person, therefore, to question
their good intentions. But that is not the point. It is not a question
of good intentions. Good intentions pave the road to hell. All the government
offices are full of papers signed by our ministers, but nothing has changed
as a result of it. If you want to introduce control, start it! Our programme
is such that in reading Skobelev’s speech we can say: we do not demand
more. We are much more moderate than Minister Skobelev. He proposes both
control and 100 per cent. We don’t want to take 100 per cent, but we say:
“Until you start doing things we don’t believe you!” Here lies the difference
between us: we don’t believe words and promises and don’t advise others
to believe them. The lessons of parliamentary republics teach us not to
believe in paper utterances. If you want control, you’ve got to start it.
One day is enough to have a law on such control issued. The employees’
council at every bank, the workers’ council at every factory, and all the
parties receive the right of control. But you can’t do that, we shall be
told. This is a commercial secret, this is sacred private property. Well,
just as you like, make your choice. If you want to safeguard all those
ledgers and accounts, all the transactions of the trusts, then don’t chatter
about control, about the country going to ruin.

 
In Germany the situation is still worse. In Russia you can get grain
but in Germany you can’t. You can do a lot in Russia through organisation,
but you can do nothing more in Germany. There is no more grain left, and
the whole nation is faced with disaster. People today write that Russia
is on the brink of ruin. If that is so, then it is a crime to safeguard
“sacred” private property. Therefore, what do the words about control mean?
Surely you haven’t forgotten that Nicholas Romanov, too, wrote a good deal
about control. You will find him repeating a thousand times the words “state
control”, “public control”, “appointment of senators”. In the two months
following the revolution the industrialists have robbed the whole of Russia.
Capitalists have made staggering profits; every financial report tells
you that. And when the workers, two months after the revolution, had the
“audacity” to say they wanted to live like human beings, the whole capitalist
press throughout the country set up a howl. Every number of Rech
is a wild howl about the workers wanting to rob the country, but all we
promise is merely control over the capitalists. Can’t we have less promises
and more deeds? If what you want is bureaucratic control, control through
the same organs as before, our Party declares its profound conviction that
you cannot be given support in this, even if there were a dozen Narodnik
and Menshevik ministers in your government instead of half a dozen. Control
can only be exercised by the people. You must arrange control by bank employees’
councils, engineers’ councils, and workers’ councils, and start that control
right away, tomorrow. Every official should be made responsible, on pain
of criminal persecution, for any wrong information he may give in any of
these institutions. It is a matter of life and death to the country. We
want to know how much grain there is, how much raw material, how many work
hands there are and where they are to be placed.

This brings me to the last question that of how to end the war. The
ridiculous view is ascribed to us that we are out for a separate peace.
The German robber capitalists are making peace overtures, saying: “We’ll
give you a piece of Turkey and Armenia if you give us ore-bearing lands”.
That is what the diplomats are talking about in every neutral city! Everybody
knows it. Only it is veiled with conventional

    

diplomatic phrases. That’s
what diplomats are for to speak in diplomatic language. What nonsense it
is to allege that we are for ending the war by a separate peace! To end
the war which is being waged by the capitalists of all the wealthiest powers,
a war stemming from the decade-long history of economic development, by
one-sided withdrawal from military operations is such a stupid idea that
it would be absurd even to refute it. The fact that we specially drew up
a resolution to refute it is because we wanted to explain things to the
broad masses before whom we were being slandered. It is not a matter that
can be seriously discussed. The war which the capitalists of all countries
are waging cannot be ended without a workers’ revolution against these
capitalists. So long as control remains a mere phrase instead of deed,
so long as the government of the capitalists has not been replaced by a
government of the revolutionary proletariat, the government is doomed merely
to reiterate: We are heading for disaster, disaster, disaster. Socialists
are now being jailed in “free” Britain for saying what I am saying. In
Germany Liebknecht has been imprisoned for saying what I am saying, and
in Austria Friedrich Adler is in jail for saying the same thing with the
help of a revolver (he may have been executed by now). The sympathy of
the mass of workers in all countries is with these socialists and not with
those who have sided with their capitalists. The workers’ revolution is
mounting throughout the world. In other countries it is a more difficult
matter, of course. They have no half-wits there like Nicholas and Rasputin.
There the best men of their class are at the head of the government. They
lack conditions there for a revolution against autocracy. They have there
a government of the capitalist class. The most talented representatives
of that class have been governing there for a long time. That is why the
revolution there, though it has not come yet, is bound to come, no matter
how many revolutionaries, men like Friedrich Adler and Karl Liebknecht,
may die in the attempt. The future belongs to them, and the workers of
all countries follow their lead. The workers in all countries are bound
to win.

On the question of America entering the war I shall say this. People
argue that America is a democracy, America

    

has the White House. I say:
slavery was abolished there half a century ago. The anti-slave war ended
in 1865. Since then multimillionaires have mushroomed. They have the whole
of America in their financial grip. They are making ready to subdue Mexico
and will inevitably come to war with Japan over a carve-up of the Pacific.
This war has been brewing for several decades. All literature speaks about
it. America’s real aim in entering the war is to prepare for this future
war with Japan. The American people do enjoy considerable freedom and it
is difficult to conceive them standing for compulsory military service,
for the setting up of an army pursuing any aims of conquest a struggle
with Japan, for instance. The Americans have the example of Europe to show
them what this leads to. The American capitalists have stepped into this
war in order to have an excuse, behind a smoke-screen of lofty ideals championing
the rights of small nations, for building up a strong standing army.

The peasants refuse to give up their grain for money and demand implements,
boots, and clothes. There is a great measure of profound truth in this
decision. Indeed, the country has reached a stage of ruin when it now faces
the same situation, although to a less intensive degree, that other countries
have long been facing, a situation in which money has lost its value. The
rule of capitalism is being so strongly undermined by the whole course
of events that the peasants, for instance, refuse to accept money. They
say: “What do we want money for?” And they are right. The rule of capitalism
is being undermined not because somebody is out to seize power. “Seizure”
of power would be senseless. It would be impossible to put an end to the
rule of capitalism if the whole course of economic development in the capitalist
countries did not lead up to it. The war has speeded up this process, and
this has made capitalism impossible. No power could destroy capitalism
if it were not sapped and undermined by history.

And now we see this clearly demonstrated. The peasant expresses what
everybody sees that the power of money has been undermined. The only way
out is for the Soviets to agree to give implements, boots, and clothes
in exchange for grain. This is what we are coming to, this is the answer

    

that life dictates. Without this, tens of millions of people will go hungry,
without clothes and boots. Tens of millions of people are facing disaster
and death; safeguarding the interests of the capitalists is the last thing
that should bother us. The only way out is for all power to be transferred
to the Soviets, which represent the majority of the population. Possibly
mistakes may be made in the process. No one claims that such a difficult
task can be disposed of offhand. We do not say anything of the sort. We
are told that we want the power to be in the hands of the Soviets, but
they don’t want it. We say that life’s experience will suggest this solution
to them, and the whole nation will see that there is no other way out.
We do not want a “seizure” of power, because the entire experience of past
revolutions teaches us that the only stable power is the one that has the
backing of the majority of the population. “Seizure” of power, therefore,
would be adventurism, and our Party will not have it. If the government
will be a government of the majority, it may perhaps embark on a policy
that will prove, at first, to be erroneous, but there is no other way out.
We shall then have a peaceful policy shift within the same organisations.
No other organisations can be invented. That is why we say that no other
solution of the question is conceivable.

How can the war be ended? If the Soviet were to assume power and the
Germans continued the war what would we do then? Anyone interested in the
views of our Party could have read in Pravda the other day an exact
quotation of what we said abroad as far back as 1915, namely, that if the
revolutionary class in Russia, the working class, comes to power, it will
have to offer peace. And if our terms are rejected by the German capitalists
or by the capitalists of any other country, then that class will stand
wholly for
war.[3]

We are not suggesting that the war be ended at one blow.
We do not promise that. We preach no such impossible and impracticable
thing as that the war can be ended by the will of one side alone. Such
promises are easy to give but impossible to fulfill. There is no easy way
out of this terrible war. It has been going on for three years. You will

    

go on fighting for ten years unless you accept the idea of a difficult
and painful revolution. There is no other way out. We say: The war which
the capitalist governments have started can only be ended by a workers’
revolution. Those interested in the socialist movement should read the
Basle Manifesto of 1912 adopted unanimously by all the socialist parties
of the world, a manifesto that was published in our newspaper Pravda,
a manifesto that can be published now in none of the belligerent countries,
neither in “free” Britain nor in republican France, because it said the
truth about war before the war. It said that there would be war between
Britain and Germany as a result of capitalist competition. It said that
so much powder had accumulated that the guns would start shooting of their
own accord. It told us what the war would be fought for, and said that
the war would lead to a proletarian revolution. Therefore, we tell those
socialists who signed this Manifesto and then went over to the side of
their capitalist governments that they have betrayed socialism. There has
been a split among the socialists all over the world. Some are in ministerial
cabinets, others in prison. All over the world some socialists are preaching
a war build-up, while others, like Eugene Debs, the American Bebel, who
enjoys immense popularity among the American workers, say: “I’d rather
be shot than give a cent towards the war. I’m willing to fight only the
proletariat’s war against the capitalists all over the world.” That is
how the socialists have split throughout the world. The world’s social-patriots
think they are defending their country. They are mistaken they are defending
the interests of one band of capitalists against another. We preach proletarian
revolution the only true cause, for which scores of people have gone to
the scaffold, and hundreds and thousands have been thrown into prison.
These imprisoned socialists are a minority, but the working class is for
them, the whole course of economic development is for them. All this tells
us that there is no other way out. The only way to end this war is by a
workers’ revolution in several countries. In the meantime we should make
preparations for that revolution, we should assist it. For all its hatred
of war and desire for peace, the Russian people could do nothing against
the war, so long as it was being waged by the tsar, except work for a revolution

    

against the tsar and for the tsar’s overthrow. And that is what happened.
History proved this to you yesterday and will prove it to you tomorrow.
We said long ago that the mounting Russian revolution must be assisted.
We said that at the end of 1914. Our Duma deputies were deported to Siberia
for this, and we were told: “You are giving no answer. You talk about revolution
when the strikes are off, when the deputies are doing hard labour, and
when you haven’t a single newspaper!” And we were accused of evading an
answer. We heard those accusations for a number of years. We answered:
You can be indignant about it, but so long as the tsar has not been overthrown
we can do nothing against the war. And our prediction was justified. It
is not fully justified yet, but it has already begun to receive justification.
The revolution is beginning to change the war on Russia’s part. The capitalists
are still continuing the war, and we say: Until there is a workers’ revolution
in several countries the war cannot be stopped, because the people who
want that war are still in power. We are told: “In a number of countries
everything seems to be asleep. In Germany all the socialists to a man are
for the war, and Liebknecht is the only one against it.” To this I say:
This only one, Liebknecht, represents the working class. The hopes of all
are in him alone, in his supporters, in the German proletariat. You don’t
believe this? Carry on with the war then! There is no other way. If you
don’t believe in Liebknecht, if you don’t believe in the workers’ revolution,
a revolution that is coming to a head if you don’t believe this then believe
the capitalists!

Nothing but a workers’ revolution in several countries can defeat this
war. The war is not a game, it is an appalling thing taking toll of millions
of lives, and it is not to be ended easily.

The soldiers at the front cannot tear the front away from the rest of
 the state and settle things their own way. The soldiers at the front are
 a part of the country. So long as the country is at war the front will
 suffer along with the rest. Nothing can be done about it. The war has been
 brought about by the ruling classes and only a revolution of the working
 class can end it. Whether you will get a speedy peace or not depends on
 how the revolution will develop.

    

Whatever sentimental things may be said,
 however much we may be told: Let us end the war immediately this cannot
 be done without the development of the revolution. When power passes to
 the Soviets the capitalists will come out against us. Japan, France, Britain
 the governments of all countries will be against us. The capitalists will
 be against, but the workers will be for us. That will be the end of the
 war which the capitalists started. There you have the answer to the question
 of how to end the war.

A whole congress of delegates from the
front,[1] in a
      resolution adopted unanimously on May 13, condemns the shabby
      methods which Rech uses to slander our Comrade Zinoviev
      and sow discord between the army and the Bolsheviks. The worthy
      gentlemen of Rech have no intention, of course, of
      publishing the resolution of the congress of  front-line
      delegates, although a copy of it was forwarded to the paper by
      the congress. Instead, that disreputable newspaper is keeping up
      its smear campaign against our paper and comrade Zinoviev in a
      deliberate attempt to provoke a minor riot.


      “Pravda regularly publishes reports about Germany which
      are to be found in no other paper. Where, how does
      Pravda get it’s special [!] information?” Rech
      asks significantly in an article significantly entitled
      “Curious Sources of Information”.


Where, Messrs. Slanderers?


From the telegrams and letters of our correspondent, Comrade
      Radek, the Polish Social-Democrat, who spent a number of years
      in tsarist prisons, who has been active for over ten years in
      the ranks of the German Social-Democrats, who has been expelled
      from Germany on account of his revolutionary agitation against
      Wilhelm and against the war, and who has gone specially to
      Stockholm to keep us sup plied with information. From letters
      and telegrams, Messrs. Cadets, which your servants who rule the
      roost on the Russian-Swedish frontier are not always able to
      intercept, from newspaper cuttings and illegal German newspapers
      and leaflets, which our friends, the followers of Karl
      Liebknecht, send us, in exactly the same way as we receive
      similar material

    

about France from the French
      socialist-internationalist Henri Guilbeaux, friend of Romain
      Rolland and associate of the well-known French internationalist
      Comrade Loriot.


      “The German General Staff has banned fraternisation,” we wrote
      in Pravda on the basis of information recently
      published in all the Russian newspapers. The Rech
      slanderers make big eyes at this and counter it with the
      statement of the Russian War Minister that all sectors of the
      front where fraternisation took place have been destroyed by the
      enemy’s artillery”.


We do not know, of course, whether this report about destroyed
      sectors is true or not. But if it is true, it
      confirms rather than refutes the report that the German
      General Staff is opposed to fraternisation. It is obvious that
      by destroying the sectors where fraternisation occurred, the
      German General Staff is discouraging fraternisation
      both on the part of the Russian soldiers and of those honest
      German soldiers who do not want to use fraternisation as a trap.


You are not very convincing, you gentlemen counterfeiters of the
      Cadet Party!


In conclusion, one more of their lies: At the Peasant Congress,
      as we know, Zinoviev was not given a chance to finish his
      speech,” writes Milyukov’s mouthpiece. As we know”, you are
      lying again, gentlemen of the Cadet Party, just as you lied
      about the congress of front-line delegates. Things must be
      pretty bad for you, gentlemen, If you are compelled to resort to
      such shameless and despicable methods.
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Congress of delegates from the front, held in Petrograd on
      May 12–17 (25–30), discussed, among others, the following
      questions: =

      the war, fraternisation by the soldiers at the front, deserters,
      and prisoners of war. The Congress declared in favour of
      organising a Front Section under the Petrograd Soviet pending
      the formation of an All-Russia Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies. The Congress, whose proceedings were influenced by the
      Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, came out against
      fraternisation and for continuing the war.

   (ARTICLE ONE) 

The inevitable debacle, the catastrophe of unprecedented
      dimensions that is facing us is of such importance that we must
      dwell on this question again and again if we are to fully grasp
      its implications. In the last issue of Pravda we said that the programme of the
      Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies no longer differs in any way from that of
      “terrible”
Bolshevism.[1]


Today we must point out that the programme of the Menshevik Minister
      Skobelev goes even further than Bolshevism. Here is
      the programme, as reported in the ministerial paper,
      Rech:



      “The Minister [Skobelev] declared that ’... the country’s
      economy is on the brink of disaster. We must intervene in all
      fields of economic life, as there is no money in the
      Treasury. We must improve the condition of the working masses,
      and to do that we must take the profits from the tills of the
      businessmen and bankers’.

    

      (Voice in the audience: ‘How?’)

    

      ’By ruthless taxation of property,’ replied the Minister of
      Labour, Skobelev. ’It is a method known to the science of
      finance. The rate of taxation on the propertied classes must be
      increased to one hundred per cent of their profits.’

    

      (Voice in the audience: ’That means everything.’)

    

      ‘Unfortunately,’ declared Skobelev, ’many corporations have
      already distributed their dividends among the share holders, and
      we must therefore levy a progressive personal tax on the
      propertied classes. We will go even further, and, if the
      capitalists wish to preserve the bourgeois method of business,
      let them work without interest, so as not to lose their
      clients.... We must introduce compulsory labour service for the
      shareholders, bankers and factory

    

owners, who are in a rather
      slack mood because the incentive that formerly stimulated them
      to work is now lacking.... We must force the shareholders to
      submit to the state; they, too, must be subject to labour
      service.’”



We advise the workers to read and reread this programme, to
      discuss it and go into the matter of its practicability.


The important thing is the conditions necessary for its
      fulfilment, and the taking of immediate steps towards its
      fulfilment.


This programme in itself is an excellent one and coincides with
      the Bolshevik programme, except that in one particular it goes
      even further than our programme, namely, it promises to
      take the profits from the tills of the bankers “to the extent of
      one hundred per cent”.


Our Party is much more moderate. Its resolution demands much
      less than this, namely, the mere establishment of control over
      the banks and the “gradual [just listen, the Bolsheviks are for
      gradualness!] introduction of a more just progressive tax on
      incomes and properties”.


Our Party is more moderate than Skobelev.


Skobelev dispenses immoderate, nay, extravagant promises,
      without understanding the conditions required for their
      practical realisation. 


That is the crux of the matter.


It is impossible not only to realise Skobelev’s
      programme, but even to make any serious efforts towards its
      realisation, either arm in arm with ten ministers from the party
      of the landowners and capitalists, or with the bureaucratic,
      official-ridden machine to which the government of the
      capitalists (plus a few Mensheviks and Narodniks)
      is perforce limited.


Less promises, Citizen Skobelev, and more practicalness. Less
      rhetoric and more understanding as to how to get down
      to business.


And get down to business we can and should immediately, without
      a day’s delay, if we are to save the country from an inevitable
      and terrible catastrophe. But the whole thing is that the “new”
      Provisional Government does not want to get down to
      business; and even if it wanted to, it could not, for
      it is fettered by a thousand chains which safeguard the
      interests of capital.

 

We can and should in a single day call upon the people to get
      down to business; we can and should in a single day issue a
      decree immediately convening:


      1) Councils and congresses of bank employees, both of individual
         banks and on a national scale, to work out immediate
         practical measures for amalgamating all banks and banking
         houses into a single State Bank, and exercising precise
         control over all banking operations, the results of such
         control to be published forthwith;


      2) Councils and congresses of employees of all syndicates and
         trusts to work out measures for control and accountancy; the
         results of such control to be published forthwith;


      3) This decree should grant the right of control not only to the
         Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies, but
         also to councils of the workers at every large factory, as
         well as to the representatives of every large political party
         (those parties should be regarded as large parties which, for
         example, on May 12 put forward independent lists of
         candidates in not less than two Petrograd districts); all
         ledgers and documents to he open to control;


      4) The decree should call upon all shareholders, directors and
         members of the boards of all companies to publish the names
         of all shareholders owning stock to an amount of not less
         than 10,000 (or 5,000) rubles, together with a list of stocks
         and companies in which these persons are “interested”; false
         statements (made to the controlling bodies of the bank and
         other employees) shall be punished by confiscation of all
         property and by imprisonment for a term of not less than five
         years;


      5) The decree should call upon the people to establish
         immediately, through the local organs of self-government,
         universal labour service, for the control and enforcement of
         which a universal people’s militia should be established (in
         the rural districts directly, in the cities through the
         workers’ militia).


Without universal labour service, the country cannot be
      saved from ruin; and without a people’s militia, universal
      labour service cannot be effected. This will be obvious to
      everyone who has not reached a state of ministerial insanity or
      has not had his brain turned by putting too much trust in
      ministerial eloquence.

 

Every person is bound to stand for such measures if he
      really wishes to save tens of millions from ruin and disaster.


In the next article we shall deal with the question of the
      gradual introduction of a more equitable system of taxation, and
      also what should be done to advance from among the people and
      gradually place in ministerial positions really gifted
      organisers (both from among the workers and the capitalists) who
      have given a good account of themselves in this kind of work.
    
 (ARTICLE TWO) 

When Skobelev, with ministerial élan, [style and vigour] talked himself into
      taking one hundred per cent of the capitalists’ profits, he
      furnished us with a specimen of





claptrap.

This kind of phrase-mongering is
      always used in bourgeois parliamentary republics to hoodwink the
      people.


But here we have something worse than mere phrase-mongering. “If
      the capitalists wish to preserve the bourgeois method of
      business, let them work without interest, so as not to lose
      their clients,” Skobelev said. This sounds like a “terrible”
      threat to the capitalists; but in fact, it is an attempt
      (unconscious probably on the part of Skobelev, but certainly
      conscious on the part of the capitalists) to make safe the
      rule of almighty capital by a temporary sacrifice of
      profits.


The workers are taking “too much”, say the capitalists; let us
      make them responsible without giving them either power or the
      opportunity to effectively control production. Let us sacrifice
      our profits for a time; “by preserving the bourgeois method of
      business and not losing our clients”, we shall hasten the
      collapse of this transitory stage in industry, we shall
      disorganise it in every possible way and lay the blame on the
      workers.


That such is the plan of the capitalists is proved by the
      facts. The coal mine owners in the South are actually
      disorganising production, are “deliberately, neglecting and
      disorganising it” (see Novaya Zhizn for May 16
      reporting statements made by a workers
delegation[2]). The picture
      is clear: Rech is lying brazenly when it puts the blame
      on the workers, The coal mine owners are “deliberately
      disorganising

    

production”; and Skobelev sings his song: “If the
      capitalists wish to preserve the bourgeois method of business,
      let them work without interest.” The position is clear.


It is to the advantage of the capitalists and the
      bureaucrats to make “extravagant promises”, diverting people’s
      attention away from the main thing, namely, the
      transfer of real control to the workers.


The workers must sweep aside all high-sounding phrases,
      promises, declarations, project-mongering by bureaucrats in the
      centre, who are ever ready to draw up spectacular plans, rules,
      regulations, and standards. Down with all this lying! Down with
      all this hullabaloo of bureaucratic and bourgeois
      project-mongering which has everywhere ended in smoke. Down with
      this habit of shelving things! The workers must demand the
      immediate establishment of genuine control, to
      be exercised by the workers themselves.


That is the most important condition of success, success in
      averting catastrophe. If that is lacking, all else is sheer
      deception. If we have it, we need not be in a hurry to “take one
      hundred per cent of the profits”. We can and should be more
      moderate; we should gradually introduce a more
      equitable system of taxation; we shall differentiate between the
      small and large shareholders; we shall take very little
      from the former, and a great deal (but not necessarily
      all) from the latter only. The number of large
      shareholders is insignificant; but the role they play, like the
      wealth they possess, is tremendous. It may safely be
      said that if one were to draw up a list of the five or even
      three thousand (or perhaps even one thousand) of Russia’s
      wealthiest men, or if one were to trace (by means of control
      exercised from below, by bank. syndicate, and other
      employees) all the threads and ties of their finance capital,
      their banking connections, there would be revealed the whole
      complexus of capitalist domination, the vast body of wealth
      amassed at the expense of the labour of others, all the
      essential roots of “control” over the social production and
      distribution of goods.


It is this control that must be handed over to the
      workers. It is this complexity, these roots, that the interests
      of capital require to be concealed from the people. Better
      forego for a time “all” our profits, or ninety-nine per cent of
      our income, than disclose to the people these roots of our
      power—thus

    

reason the capitalist class and its unconscious
      servant, the government official.


Under no circumstances shall we relinquish our right,
      our demand that this citadel of finance capital be disclosed to
      the people, that it be placed under workers’ control—thus
      reasons the class-conscious worker. And every passing day will
      prove the correctness of this reasoning to growing masses of the
      poor, to a growing majority of the people, to a growing number
      of sincere people who are honestly seeking a way to avert
      disaster.


This citadel of finance capital has to be taken if all those
      phrases and projects for averting disaster are not to remain
      sheer deception. As far as individual capitalists, or even most
      of the capitalists, are concerned, the proletariat has no
      intention of “taking their last shirt from them” (as Shulgin has
      been “scaring” himself and his friends), has no intention of
      taking “everything” from them. On the contrary, it intends to
      put them on useful and honourable jobs—under the control of
      the workers.


The most useful and indispensable job for the people at this
      moment of impending catastrophe is that of
      organisation. Marvels of proletarian
      organisation—that is our slogan now, and will become our
      slogan and our demand doubly so when the proletariat is in
      power. Without the organisation of the masses it will be
      absolutely impossible either to introduce universal labour
      service, which is absolutely essential, or establish any at all
      serious control over the banks and syndicates and over the
      production and distribution of goods.


That is why it is necessary to begin, and begin immediately,
      with a workers’ militia, in order that we may proceed gradually,
      but firmly and intelligently, to the creation of a people’s
      militia and the replacement of the police and the standing army
      by the universally armed people. That is why it is necessary to
      advance talented organisers from among all sections of
      society, from among all classes, not excepting the
      capitalists, who at present have more of the required
      experience. There are many such talents among the people. Such
      forces lie dormant among the peasantry and the proletariat for
      lack of application. They must be advanced from below in the
      course of practical work, such as the efficient

    

elimination of
      queues in a given district, skilful organisation of house
      committees, domestic servants, and model farms, proper
      management of factories that have been taken over by the
      workers, and so on and so forth. When these have been advanced
      from below in the course of practical work, and their abilities
      tested in practice, they should all be promoted to
      “ministers”—not in the old sense of the term, not in the
      sense of giving them portfolios, but by appointing them national
      instructors, travelling organisers, assistants in the business
      of establishing everywhere the strictest order, the
      greatest economy in human labour, the strictest comradely
      discipline.
    

That is what the party of the proletariat must preach to the
      people as the means of averting disaster. That is what it must
      start carrying out now in part in those localities where it is
      gaining power. That is what it must carry out in full when it
      assumes state power.

This refers to statements made by a delegation of Donet workers
      to the Economic Department of the Petrograd Soviet. This
      delegation was sent to Petrograd by the April-May conference
      (1917) of workers of the coal and iron and steel industries in
      the south of Russia to ask the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
      and the Ministry of Labour to intercede in obtaining a rise for
      the lower-paid brackets from the association of Donets
      capitalists.


The delegation submitted statements describing the intolerable
      conditions of the workers and gave numerous instances of
      sabotage on the part of the owners and mangers of the



collieries and metallurgical works, who were out to crush the
revolutionary-minded workers and starve them into submission.

The All-Russia Conference of our Party passed a resolution recognising that
      closer relations and unity with groups and trends that have
      adopted a real internationalist stand are necessary on the basis
      of a definite break with the policy of petty-bourgeois betrayal
      of
socialism.[1]


The question of unity was also recently discussed at a
      conference of the Inter-District Organisation of the United
      Social-Democrats of Petrograd.
    

In compliance with the decision of the All-Russia Conference,
      the Central Committee of our Party, recognising the extreme
      desirability of union with the Inter-District Organisation,
      advanced the following proposals (they were first made to the
      Inter-District Organisation only in the name of Comrade Lenin
      and a few other members of the Central Committee, but were
      subsequently approved by the majority of the members of the
      Central Committee):
    

      “Unity is desirable immediately.
    

      “The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party will be asked to include a representative of the
      Inter-District Organisation on the staff of each of the two
      papers (the present Pravda, which is to be converted
      into an All-Russia popular newspaper, and the Central
      Organ to be established in the near future).
    

      “The Central Committee will be asked to set up a special
      Organising Committee to summon a Party Congress (in six weeks’
      time). The Inter-District Conference will be entitled to appoint
      two delegates to this committee. If the Mensheviks, adherents of
      Martov, break with the ’defencists’,

    

it would be desirable and essential to include their delegates
      on the above-mentioned committee,
    

      “Free discussion of controversial issues shall be ensured by the
      publication of discussion leaflets by Priboi
Publishers and by free discussion in the journal Prosveshcheniye
      (Kommunist),[2] publication of which is being resumed.”


      (Draft read by N. Lenin on May 10, 1917, in his own name and in
      the name of several members of the Central Committee.)


The Inter-District Organisation, for their part, passed a
      different resolution, which reads:



      “ On unity. Realising that only by the closest consolidation of
      all its revolutionary forces can the proletariat


      “1) become the foremost fighter in clearing the way for
      socialism;


      “2) become the leader of Russian democracy in its struggle
      against
      the survivals of the semi-feudal regime and the heritage of
      tsarism;


      “3) fight out the revolution and finally settle the questions of
      war
      and peace, the confiscation of the land, the eight-hour day,
      etc.,


      “the Conference is of the opinion


      “a) that a consolidation of forces, so indispensable to the
      proletariat, can be achieved only under the banner of Zimmerwald
      and Kienthal, and the programme and decisions of the Party of
      the years 1908 and 1910. 1912 and 1913;


      “b) that not a single labour organisation, be it a
      trade union, an educational club, or a consumers’ co-operative
      society, and not a single labour newspaper or periodical should
      refrain from enlisting under that banner;


      “c) at the same time, the Conference declares itself to he
      decidedly and ardently in favour of unity on the basis of these
      decisions.”



Which of these resolutions will be quicker in bringing about
      unity is a question for all internationalist workers to discuss
      and decide.

The political resolutions of the Inter-District Organisation
      have in general adopted the sound course of breaking with the
      “defencists”.
    

Under the circumstances, any division of forces would, in our
      opinion, be utterly unjustifiable.

Muddleheadedness

The editors of Izvestia, a paper controlled by the
      Narodnik and Menshevik bloc, are beating all records of
      muddledom. In that paper’s issue No.67 for May 16, they try to
      chop logic with Pravda, without, of course, mentioning
      its name—a usual ill-mannered “ministerial”
      practice. Pravda, we are told, has a foggy, misleading
      idea of annexations.


Begging your pardon, citizen-ministers and ministerial editors,
      but facts are facts, and the fact is that our Party was the
      only one to give a definition of annexation in official
      and carefully worded resolutions. Annexation means keeping an
      alien people by force within the bounds of a given state. No
      person able to read and understand Russian could fail
      to understand that on reading the Supplement to No. 13 of
      Soldatskaya Pravda (resolutions of the All-Russia
      Conference of April 24–29,
1917).[1]


What exception do the Narodnik and Menshevik editors of
      Izvestia take to this? Simply this: that if our view
      were adopted it would be necessary to “keep on fighting until
      Germany is reduced to the Duchy of Brandenburg, and Russia to
      the Principality of Muscovy”! Annexation, the editors explain
      for the edification of their readers, “is the forcible seizure
      of territory which, on the day war was declared, belonged to
      another country” (in short: no annexations means status quo,
      that is, a return to the state of affairs that existed before
      the war).

 

It is careless, most careless, on the part of the Narodnik and
      Menshevik leaders of the Soviet’s Executive Committee to put
      such muddle-headed people in charge of a newspaper.


Let us apply to their definition the argument
      they used against us. Would we have to “keep on
      fighting until Russia recovered Poland, and Germany Togoland and
      her African colonies”? Palpable nonsense, nonsense from the
      practical as well as the theoretical point of view, since no
      soldier anywhere would think twice about dismissing any editors
      who argued in this way.


The flaw in their argument is this:


      (1) The theoretical definition of annexation involves the
          conception of an “alien” people, that is, a people that has
          preserved its distinctive features and its will towards
          independent existence. Ponder this, fellow-citizens, and if
          it is still not clear to you, read what Engels and Marx had
          to say about Ireland, about Germany’s Danish territories,
          and the colonies—and you will realise how confused you
          are. The Duchy of Brandenburg and the Principality of
          Muscovy have nothing to do with it.
    

      (2) To confuse the idea of annexation with the question
          of how long “to keep on fighting” is ridiculous; it means
          failure to grasp the connection that exists between war and
          the interests and rule of definite classes; it means
          abandoning the standpoint of the class struggle for
          the philistine “non-class” standpoint. So long as
          the capitalist class is in power the nations are bound “to
          keep on fighting” as Long as that class wants it. To think
          that one can escape this by wishes, demands, or conferences
          is the illusion of a petty bourgeois.
    

      (3) So long as the capitalist class is in power,
          their peace is bound to be “an exchange of
          annexations”—Armenia for Lorraine, colony for colony,
          Galicia for Kurland, and so on. We can pardon an ignorant
          man for failing to see this, but not the editors of
          Izvestia.
    

      (4) When the proletariat comes to power—and that is what
          the war is leading up to everywhere—then and only then
          will “peace without annexations” become possible.


When our Party speaks of “peace without annexations” It always
      explains—as a warning to muddle-headed people—that
      this slogan must be closely linked with the proletarian
      revolution. Only in connection with this revolution is it true
      and useful; it pursues only the revolution’s line, and

    

works only for the revolution’s growth and development. To
      vacillate weakly between hopes in the capitalists and hopes in
      the workers’ revolution is to condemn oneself to impotence and
      muddle in the question of annexations.

 


P.S. Dyelo Naroda for May 17 agrees with
      Izvestia that “no annexations” is equivalent to status
      quo. Try and say that, gentlemen of the S.R. or Menshevik fold,
      say it clearly, precisely, and straightforwardly in the name of
      your party, your Petrograd Committee, your congress!

Izvestia for May 17 publishes a tiresomely lengthy and
      silly resolution of the Soviet’s Economic Department concerning
      ways of combating economic chaos.


And what a combat that is! Splendid ideas and excellent plans
      are smothered in a net of dead, bureaucratic institutions. “The
      Economic Department shall be converted [mark this!] into a
      department for the organisation of the national economy.”


Excellent! We are on the right track! The country can make its
      mind easy. The Department has been renamed.


But is it possible to “organise the national economy”. without
      wielding state power? This the Executive Committee has
      overlooked.


The Department has six “sub-departments”.... That is
      Point I of the resolution. Point 2 is about establishing “close
      organisational ties”; Point 3 is about working out the “basic

      Vredny[1] but from Izvestia No. 68, for May 17,
      page 3, column 3, Point 4); Point 5 is about “the government forming
      commissions”; Point 6 is about “a bill to be drafted in the very
      near future”; Point 7 is about starting immediately “to draw up
      basic legislative proposals” on five sub-points....

The Narodniks and Mensheviks, who are editing Izvestia,
      wish to be considered socialists, but do not even know how to be
      democrats. In their issue No. 68, for May 17, they advise
      “caution” with regard to the “slogan of partial
      re-elections”. They tell the workers that “deputies should be
      elected for a fixed term—two or three months, say—but
      never [!] for a week, from one meeting to another”.
    

Is it proper for an official organ to worry about re-elections
      and to advise “caution”? . ..Caution in what? In the expression
      of popular distrust in that organ! 


That is the first question.
    

The second question is: Should not an intelligent democrat deal
      with the question of caution in the matter of re-elections (if
      it is to be dealt with at all) from the point of view of
      partyism? Is it not his duty, for instance, to say: We,
      Narodniks and Mensheviks, consider the line taken by our bloc to
      be correct on such-and-such grounds, and that of the Bolsheviks
      to be incorrect for such-and-such reasons? Why then do the
      editors depart from democratic principles and, instead of
      appealing to partyism, use such a strange argument as that
      mistakes at elections are an “exception”? Don’t they know that
      the “mistake” of having the Skobelevs and Chernovs join the
      capitalist cabinet is being weighed and discussed by the workers
      everywhere, that it is not an “exception” at all?
      


The third question is this: Is it not the duty of a democrat,
      who wishes to raise the question of re-elections, to recognise
      and emphasise the principle of democracy—the right of the

    

population at any time to recall each and every
      representative, each and every person holding elected office?


Will not the editors of Izvestia, if they still reckon
      with the opinions of the founders of scientific socialism, Marx
      and Engels, recall what those real socialists said with regard
      to such a right?

In an editorial on May 17 Finansovaya Gazeta writes:
    


      “The political upheaval, which everyone looked forward to, is
      assuming the form of a social revolution without precedent
      anywhere. The ’class struggle’, which is a legitimate and
      natural thing in a free country, has taken on with us the
      character of a class war. A financial crash is imminent. An
      industrial crash is unavoidable.
    

      “To effect a political revolution it was enough to make Nicholas
      II abdicate the throne and to arrest a dozen of his
      ministers. That was easily done in a single day. To effect a
      social revolution, however, tens of millions of citizens must be
      made to abdicate their property rights and all non-socialists
      must be arrested. This cannot be done in scores of years.”



That is untrue, worthy fellow-citizens. It is a glaring lie! You
      choose to call control over industry by the workers
      “social revolution”. In doing so you are committing three
      monstrous errors.


First, the revolution of February 27 was also a social
      revolution. Every political upheaval, if it is not a mere change
      of cliques, is a social revolution. The thing is—what
      class makes that social revolution. The revolution of
      February 27, 1917 took the power from the feudal landowners
      headed by Nicholas II and gave it to the bourgeoisie. It was a
      social revolution of the bourgeoisie.


By the use of clumsy unscientific terminology which confuses
      “social” with “socialist” revolution, Finansovaya
      Gazeta tries to conceal from the people the
      obvious fact that the workers and peasants cannot content
      themselves with seizure of power by the bourgeoisie.


By trying to ignore this clear and simple fact the capitalists
      are deceiving themselves and the people.


Secondly, “without precedent anywhere” is also applicable to the
      great imperialist war of 1914–17. Such a debacle, such bloody
      horrors, such a disaster, and such a break-down of our
    

entire civilisation are “without precedent anywhere”. It is
      not anybody’s impatience, not anybody’s propaganda, but
      objective conditions and this unprecedented break-down of
      civilisation that necessitate this control over production and
      distribution, over the banks, factories, etc.


Failing this, tens of millions of people can be said without
      exaggeration to face inevitable ruin and death.


In view of the freedom created by the “political upheaval” of
      February 27, in view of the existence of the Soviets, such
      control is impossible unless the workers and peasants
      unite, unless the minority of the population bows to the
      majority. Nothing can alter this, protest as you may.


Third, and most important of all—even for the purpose of a
      socialist revolution there is no need at all for “tens
      of millions of citizens to abdicate their property rights”. Not
      even socialism (and control over the banks and factories
      does not yet mean socialism) requires anything of the
      kind.


This is an infamous defamation on socialism. No socialist has
      ever proposed that the “tens of millions”, i.e., the small and
      middle peasants, should be deprived of their property (=“made to
      abdicate their property rights”).


Nothing of the kind!
    

Socialists everywhere have always denied such
      nonsense.


Socialists are out to make only the
      landowners and capitalists “abdicate”. To deal a decisive blow
      at those who are defying the people the way the colliery owners
      are doing when they disrupt and ruin production, it is
      sufficient to make a few hundred, at the most one or
      two thousand, millionaires, bank and industrial and commercial
      bosses, “abdicate” their property rights.


This would be quite enough to break the resistance of
      capital. Even this tiny group of wealthy people need
      not have all their property rights taken away from
      them; they could be allowed to keep many possessions in the way
      of consumption articles and ownership of a certain modest
      income.
    

The question at issue is merely that of breaking down the
      resistance of a few hundred millionaires. Only in this way can
      disaster be averted.

The report made in Petrograd recently by a delegation of Donets
      workers exposed the Donets coal mine owners, who are criminally
      disrupting and stopping production, and (for the sake
      of safeguarding their “sacred” right to enormous profits) are
      condemning the workers to unemployment, the country to
      starvation, and industry to a crisis through a coal shortage.


Today we have received a telegram reporting similar outrageous
      and criminal conduct on the part of the coal mine owners at the
      other end of Russia. Here is the text of the telegram sent to
      the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and to three
      cabinet ministers (with our corrections in parenthesis):



      “On April 29 the (Soviet) of Soldiers’ Deputies and the Union of
      Employees at Michelson’s Sudzhensk coal mines removed from
      office the nine-man administration owing to the criminally
      provocative manner in which they ran the business, which
      threatened to lead to a shutdown. The management has been placed
      (in) the hands of a Council of Engineers—.a technical board
      directly controlled by the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies. A committee from the executive bodies in Tomsk has
      investigated and approved our decision.


      “In a telegram dated May 11 Michelson refused to pay the
      workers. We demand full restoration. Restoration
impossible.[1]

The mines are facing anarchy, the
      workers—disaster. Take urgent steps to send half a million
      rubles, decide the fate of the mines, confiscate them. The mines
      are working for national defence, daily output is 135,000
      poods. A stoppage may affect railway traffic and (operation of
      the) factories. So far work is normal. Wages for March and April
      not paid in full. Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and
      Union of Employees.”



No more fitting expression than that used by the Soviet and the
      Employees’ Union in their telegram could be found,

    

namely, that
      the capitalists are running the business in a “criminally
      provocative manner”.


All the members of the Provisional Government, the so-called
      socialist ministers included, will be accomplices in this crime
      if they continue to “grapple” with the impending debacle by
      means of resolutions, commissions, conferences with employers,
      if they continue “to waste words where they should use their
      power” (against the capitalists).
    

 
Notes
 

[1]
The meaning is not clear. Does it mean that in case of a
stoppage it will be difficult and almost impossible to get the
mines restarted?

Yedinstvo
      (unity with the

alleges today that “the Leninists
      contend that Kurland
      is a German province”.


That is a lie. That is in the vein of Russkaya Volya
      and Rech, and it is a lie.
 

Pravda has challenged Rech and other papers to
      give a definition of annexation that would fit all annexations,
      German, British, and Russian.


The bourgeois newspapers (Yedinstvo included) are
      unable to answer this question and so they dismiss it by
      repeating the old lies. Shame!

The newspapers have again published a false report, alleging
      that for some unexplained reason I did not attend the Peasant
      Congress, evaded it, etc. As a matter of fact I was to have
      addressed the Congress on Wednesday and was prepared to do so
      when I was notified that on Wednesday the organisation question
      was to be discussed instead of the agrarian question, which was
      temporarily put off. The same thing occurred today, i.e., on
      Thursday. Once more I ask readers not to believe the papers,
      except Pravda.

It has not. Dual power still remains. The basic question of
      every revolution, that of state power, is still in an uncertain,
      unstable, and obviously transitory state.


Compare the papers of the cabinet, Rech, for instance,
      with Izvestia, Dyelo Naroda, and Rabochaya
      Gazeta. Scan the meagre—unfortunately all too
      meagre—official reports of what is going on at the meetings
      of the Provisional Government, of how the government “postpones”
      discussion of the most vital issues, because of its inability to
      take any definite course. Study the resolution of the Soviet’s
      Executive Committee passed on May 16, which deals with such a
      crucial and momentous question as that of how to cope with
      economic chaos and avert imminent debacle—and you will see
      that dual power is absolutely intact.


Everyone admits that the country is swiftly heading for
      disaster—yet all that is done about it is to brush the
      question under the carpet.


Is it not side-stepping the issue, when a resolution on such a
      grave question as impending economic catastrophe, at such a
      grave moment, merely creates a spate of commissions,
      departments, and sub-departments; when the same Executive
      Committee passes a resolution expressing nothing but pious
      wishes on such a scandalous affair as that of the Donets coal
      mine owners who were found guilty of deliberately disorganising
production?[1]

Price
      fixing, profit regulation, the
      establishment of a minimum wage, and the formation of
      state-controlled trusts—yes, but how, through whom?
      “Through the central and local institutions in the Donets Krivoi
      Rog Basin. These institutions must be democratic in character
      and made up of representatives of the workers,

    

employers, the
      government, and democratic revolutionary organisations”!


This would be comical if the matter involved were not a tragedy.


It is common knowledge that such “democratic” institutions have
      existed and still exist locally and in Petrograd (the very same
      Executive Committee of the Soviet) but they are powerless to do
      anything. Meetings between the Donets workers and the employers
      have been going on since the end of March—March! Over six
      weeks have passed and the result is that the Donets workers have
      been forced to the conclusion that the coal mine owners are
      deliberately disorganising production!


And again the people are fed with promises, commissions,
      meetings between representatives of the workers and employers
      (in equal numbers?), and the old red tape  starts all over again.


The root of the evil is in the dual power. The root of the
      Narodniks’ and Mensheviks’ error is that they do not understand
      the class struggle, and want to replace or cloak it, reconcile
      it by means of phrases, promises, resolutions, commissions “with
      the participation” of representatives ... of the same dual
      government!


The capitalists have made fantastic, outrageous fortunes out of
      the war. They have the majority of the government on their
      side. They want to rule supreme; in view of their class position
      they are bound to make a bid for supreme power and fight for it.


The working masses constitute the vast majority of the
      population, they control the Soviets, they are aware of their
      power as a majority, they see everywhere the promise of a
      “democratised” life, they know that democracy is the rule of the
      majority over the minority (and not the reverse—
      which is what the capitalists want), they have been striving to
      better their lives only since the revolution (and then not
      everywhere), and not since the beginning of the
      war—therefore they cannot but aspire towards supreme rule
      by the people, i.e., the majority of the population, towards
      affairs being managed according to the will of the worker
      majority as opposed to the capitalist minority, and not
      according to an “agreement” between the majority and the
      minority.

 

Dual power still remains. The government of the capitalists
      remains a government of the capitalists, despite the appended
      tag of Narodniks and Mensheviks in a minority capacity. The
      Soviets remain the organisation of the majority. The Narodnik
      and Menshevik leaders are floundering helplessly in an attempt
      to straddle two stools.


Meanwhile the crisis is growing. Things have reached a point
      where the capitalists—the coal mine owners—are
      brazenly committing outrageous crimes—they are
      disorganising and stopping production. Unemployment is
      spreading. There is talk of lockouts. Actually they have
      started in the form of disorganisation of production by
      the capitalists (for coal is the bread of industry!),
      in the form of growing unemployment.


Sole responsibility for this crisis, for the impending
      catastrophe, rests with the Narodnik and Menshevik leaders. For
      it is they who are at present the leaders of the Soviets, i.e.,
      of the majority. That the minority (the capitalists) should be
      unwilling to submit to the majority is inevitable. No person who
      has not forgotten the lessons which science and the experience
      of all countries teach us, no person who has not forgotten the
      class struggle, will look trustfully towards “an agreement” with
      the capitalists on such an essential, burning question.


The majority of the population, i.e., the Soviets, the workers
      and peasants, would be fully able to save the situation, prevent
      the capitalists from disorganising and stopping production,
      establish their own immediate and effective control
      over production if it were not for the “conciliatory” policy of
      the Narodnik and Menshevik leaders. They bear full
      responsibility for the crisis and the catastrophe.


There is no way out, however, other than by the worker
      and peasant majority deciding to act against the capitalist
      minority. Playing for time will not help, it will only make
      matters worse.


Viewed from a Marxist angle, the “conciliatory” attitude of the
      Narodnik and Menshevik leaders is a manifestation of
      petty-bourgeois indecision. The petty bourgeoisie is afraid to
      trust the workers, and is afraid to break with the
      capitalists. Such wavering is inevitable, as inevitable as our
      struggle, the struggle of the proletarian party, to overcome

    

indecision, and to make the people see the necessity for
      rehabilitating, organising, and increasing production in the
      teeth of capitalist opposition.


There is no other way out. Either we go back to supreme rule by
      the capitalists, or forward towards real democracy, towards
      majority decisions. This dual power cannot last long.

Izvestia of the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants’
      Deputies,[2] in its issue No. 10 for May 19, publishes a
      report by S.
      Maslov who discourses on the subject of “land seizures”.


      “In some places,” says S. Maslov, “the peasants are endeavouring
      to assert their right to the land by unauthorised seizure of
      lands belonging to the local landowners. The question arises: is
      such a procedure advisable?”


S. Maslov considers it inadvisable, and gives four reasons for
      thinking so. Let us examine his arguments.


Argument 1. Russia’s lands are distributed unevenly in the
      various regions and gubernias. In pointing out this
      incontestable fact, S. Maslov says:



      “It is not difficult to imagine how complicated the proper
      settlement of the land question would become if every gubernia
      or region laid claim only to its own lands and seized them for
      its own use. It is not difficult to foresee what would happen if
      the peasants of some villages seized the land of the local
      landowners and left the other peasants without any land.”



This argument is an obvious, a gross deviation from the
      truth. It would hold good against anybody who might take it into
      his head to advise the peasants to seize the land—and seize
      it in an unorganised way at that—as private
      property. Take it, share it—and that’s that.


That would indeed be the height of anarchism, the height of absurdity.

 

We do not know what party, if any, proposed such nonsense. If
      that is what S. Maslov had in mind, then he is fighting
       windmills. It is
      ludicrous.


Our Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party of the
      Bolsheviks, has proposed in a carefully worded resolution that
      property in the land be vested in the people as a
      whole. Consequently, we are opposed to any seizure of
      land as private property.


But this is not the question at issue, and S. Maslov has
      betrayed himself by mentioning what is really the essential and
      cardinal point, namely, the seizure of the landed
      estates. That is the crux of the matter. It is on this
      question that S. Maslov is beating about the bush.


The landed estates must be confiscated immediately,
      that is, private ownership of them must be abolished
      immediately and  without compensation.


And what about the possession of these lands? Who is to
      take immediate possession of them and cultivate them? The local
      peasants are to do this in an organised way, that is, in
      accordance with the decision of the majority. That is the advice
      of our Party. The local peasants are to have the
      immediate use of these lands, which are to become the
      property of the people as a whole. Ownership will be
      finally decided by the Constituent Assembly (or the
      All-Russia Council of Soviets, should the people choose to make
      it the Constituent Assembly).


What has the uneven distribution of lands in the various regions
      got to do with this? Obviously, nothing whatever. Pending the
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly this uneven distribution
      will remain under all plans, be it the landowners’
      plan, S. Maslov’s plan or our own plan.


S. Maslov is simply drawing the attention of the peasants away
      from the matter in hand. He has screened the real issue behind
      empty words that have no bearing upon the matter.


And the real issue is that of the landed estates. The land
      owners are for keeping them. We are for handing them over
      immediately to the peasants without compensation,
      free of charge. Maslov is for shelving the question by
      means of “conciliation chambers”.

 

That is bad. Stalling tactics are bad. The landowners must
      submit at once to the will of the peasant majority without
      attempts at conciliation between this peasant majority and the
      landowner minority. This conciliation is an unlawful, unjust,
      undemocratic privilege for the landowners.


Maslov’s second argument is this:



      “The peasants are for seizing the land in the hope that if they
      manage to raise a crop on it they will be able to keep it. But
      this can be done only by such peasant households as have the
      necessary number of work hands and horses. Horseless families or
      families that have given most of their labour-power to the army
      will not be able to get land by this seizure method. Obviously,
      those who will gain by this method are those who are the
      stronger, or even those who are more land-prosperous, and not
      those who arc most in need of land.”



This argument, too, is a downright falsehood. Again S. Maslov
      tries to draw the attention of the peasants away from the real
      issue—that of the landed estates. If the peasants were to
      take the landed estates not by “seizure” (i.e., free of charge,
      as we propose), but on lease, that is, paying
      rent for the land (as the landowners and S. Maslov
      propose)—would anything be altered? Are not horses and
      work hands needed to till the land rented from the landowners?
      Can families that have given their working members to the army
      lease land on a par with large families?


The difference between our Party, the Bolsheviks, and Maslov on
      this point is that he proposes the land should be taken from the
      landowners for payment after a “conciliation” agreement has been
      arrived at, whereas we propose taking it immediately and free of
      charge.


The question of rich people among the peasants has
      nothing to do with it. What is more, to take the land free of
      charge is more in the interests of the poor. To pay
      rent is easier for the rich.


What measures are possible and necessary to prevent the rich
      peasant from wronging the poor one?



1. Majority decision (there are more poor than rich). This is what we propose;


      2. A special organisation of poor peasants, where they can
         specially discuss their own special
         interests. This is what we propose;

 

      3. Common cultivation of the landed estates by common draft
         animals and common implements under the direction of the
         Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies. This is what we
         propose.


These last two measures—the most important—are just
      the ones the Party of the “Socialist-Revolutionaries” does
      not support. It’s a great pity.


The third argument is this:



      “At the beginning, during the early days of the revolution, when
      rumours were current among the soldiers that back there, at
      home, a division of the land was taking place, many of them were
      eager to go home for fear of being done out of their
      share. Cases of desertion became more frequent.”



This argument concerns the immediate division of the
      land as private property. No one has proposed any such
      thing. S. Maslov is wide of the mark again.


The fourth argument:



      “Finally, land seizures simply threaten to reduce the
      crops. There have been cases when the peasants, after seizing
      the landed estates, have done the sowing poorly , using
      insufficient seeds or leaving their own land uncultivated. Now
      that the country is so badly in need of food such a situation is
      absolutely intolerable.”



This is such a flimsy argument that people can only laugh at
      it. We are asked to believe that if the land taken from the
      landowners is paid for it will be cultivated better!


You ought to be ashamed of yourself to use such arguments, Citizen Maslov!


If the peasants sow the fields poorly, they should be
      helped—and this particularly applies to the poor
      peasants—by means of collective cultivation of the
      large estates. There is no other way of helping the
      poor peasants. And this, unfortunately, is just the remedy which
      S. Maslov does not propose.


In all justice it should be said that S. Maslov apparently
      realises the flimsiness of his arguments, for be hastens to add:



      “After what I have said I feel that some of you are ready to
      protest, saying, how can we be told to leave things as they were
      when we have suffered so much from this big landownership. I do
      not claim to propose anything.”


 

Precisely! From what Maslov said it could be inferred that he
      wished to leave things as they were (although he does
      not want that). There is something wrong with his
      arguments then.


It is for the peasants to decide. It Is for parties to
      propose. Our Party proposes what I have stated above. These
      proposals have been clearly elaborated in our
resolutions,[1]

      Preface to the Pamphlet Materials Relating

to the Revision of the Party Programme


The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party (“Bolsheviks”) has instructed the undersigned to publish
      immediately the material at present in the possession of the
      Central Committee relating to the revision of the Party
      Programme.

This material consists of the following:

a) The initial draft of amendments to the theoretical and
      political sections of the programme which the present writer
      submitted to the All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. on
      April 24–29, 1917, and which was examined so far only by the
      committee set up by the Conference for the detailed elaboration
      of this question.

b) Comments on the draft, or in connection with the draft, made
      by the committee or by its individual members.

c) My reply to these comments.

d) A complete draft of proposed changes in the economic minimum
      programme worked out at the Conference of April 24–29, 1917 by
      the sub-committee on the protection of labour.

e) A draft, supplied with brief explanatory notes, of changes to
      be made in the clauses of the Party Programme dealing with
      public education. This draft was drawn up by N. K. Krupskaya
      after the Conference.

I am appending brief notes to this material, for I consider that
      the chief purpose of the Party in publishing this material at
      the present time is to secure the active participation of the
      greatest possible number of comrades in the work of drawing up
      the Party Programme.
 

Taken together, the proposed changes above enumerated form the
      draft of the complete text of a new programme. I therefore give
      both the old and the new texts of the programme at the
      end of this pamphlet, arranged so as to present the reader with
      all the material in the form most convenient for comparison and
      for the insertion of amendments.

On behalf of the Central Committee, I ask all comrades, both
      members of the Party and sympathisers, to reprint this material
      in Party publications as widely as possible, to bring it to the
      attention of every member of the Party and to address
      all comments and proposals to the office of Pravda (32
      Moika, Petrograd, marked: for the Central Committee, Material
      Relating to Programme Revision).

    Proposed Amendments

      to the Doctrinal, Political and Other Sections

     of the Programme
   

At the end of the preamble (after the words “the standpoint of
      the proletariat”) insert:

World capitalism has at the present time, i.e., about the
      beginning of the twentieth century, reached the stage of
      imperialism. Imperialism, or the epoch of finance capital, is a
      high stage of development of the capitalist economic system, one
      in which monopolist associations of capitalists—syndicates,
      cartels, and trusts—have assumed decisive importance; in
      which enormously concentrated banking capital has fused with
      industrial capital; in which the export of capital to foreign
      countries has assumed vast dimensions; in which the whole world
      has been divided up territorially among the richer countries,
      and the economic carve-up of the world among international
      trusts has begun.

Imperialist wars, i.e., wars for world domination, for markets
      for banking capital and for the subjugation of small and weaker
      nations, are inevitable under such a state of affairs. The first
      great imperialist war, the war of 1914–17, is precisely such a
      war.

The extremely high level of development which world capitalism
      in general has attained, the replacement of free competition by
      monopoly capitalism, the fact that the banks and the capitalist
      associations have prepared the machinery for the social
      regulation of the process of production and distribution of
      products, the rise in the cost of living and increased
      oppression of the working class by the syndicates due to the
      growth of capitalist monopolies, the tremendous

    

obstacles
      standing in the way of the proletariat’s economic and political
      struggle, the horrors, misery, ruin, and brutalisation caused by
      the imperialist war—all these factors transform the present
      stage of capitalist development into an era of proletarian
      socialist revolution.

That era has dawned.

Only a proletarian socialist revolution can lead humanity out of
      the impasse which imperialism and imperialist wars have
      created. Whatever difficulties the revolution may have to
      encounter, whatever possible temporary setbacks or waves of
      counter-revolution it may have to contend with, the final
      victory of the proletariat is inevitable.

Objective conditions make it the urgent task of the day to
      prepare the proletariat in every way for the conquest of
      political power in order to carry out the economic and political
      measures which are the sum and substance of the socialist
      revolution.


The fulfilment of this task, which calls for the fullest trust,
      the closest fraternal ties, and direct unity of revolutionary
      action on the part of the working class in all the advanced
      countries, is impossible without an immediate break in principle
      with the bourgeois perversion of socialism, which has gained the
      upper hand among the leadership of the great majority of the
      official Social-Democratic parties. Such a perversion is, on the
      one hand, the social-chauvinist trend, socialism in word and
      chauvinism in deed, the defence of the predatory interests of
      “one’s own” national bourgeoisie under the guise of “defence of
      the fatherland”; and, on the other hand, the equally wide
      international trend of the so-called “Centre”, which stands for
      unity with the social—chauvinists and for the preservation
      or correction of the bankrupt Second International, and which
      vacillates between social-chauvinism and the internationalist
      revolutionary struggle of the proletariat for the achievement of
      a socialist system.


In the minimum programme, the whole beginning (from the words
      “On the path” down to § 1) should be crossed out, and
      replaced by the following:
 

In Russia at the present moment, when the Provisional
      Government, which is part and parcel of the capitalist class and
      enjoys the confidence—necessarily unstable—of the
      broad mass of the petty-bourgeois population, has undertaken to
      convene a Constituent Assembly, the immediate duty of the party
      of the proletariat is to fight for a political system which will
      best guarantee economic progress and the rights of the people in
      general, and make possible the least painful transition to
      socialism in particular.

The party of the proletariat cannot rest content with a
      bourgeois parliamentary democratic republic, which throughout
      the world preserves and strives to perpetuate the monarchist
      instruments for the oppression of the masses, namely, the
      police, the standing army, and the privileged bureaucracy.

The party fights for a more democratic workers’ and peasants’
      republic, in which the police and the standing army will be
      abolished and replaced by the universally armed people, by a
      people’s militia; all officials will be not only elective, but
      also subject to recall at any time upon the demand of a majority
      of the electors; all officials, without exception, will be paid
      at a rate not exceeding the average wage of a competent worker;
      parliamentary representative institutions will be gradually
      replaced by Soviets of people’s representatives (from various
      classes and professions, or from various localities),
      functioning as both legislative and executive bodies.

The constitution of the Russian democratic republic must ensure:

      § 1. The sovereignty of the people; supreme power in the
      state must be vested entirely in the people’s representatives,
      who shall be elected by the people and be subject to recall at
      any time, and who shall constitute a single popular assembly, a
      single chamber.

      § 2. Add:

Proportional representation at all elections; all delegates and
      elected officials, without exception, to be subject to recall at
      any time upon the decision of a majority of their electors.

      § 3. Add
 

The abolition of all State-appointed local and regional
authorities.[1]


The last sentence in § 8 to be worded as follows:

The native language to be used in all local public and state
      institutions; the obligatory official language to be
      abolished.

      § 9 to read:

The right of all member nations of the state to freely secede
      and form independent states. The republic of the Russian nation
      must attract other nations or nationalities not by force, but
      exclusively by voluntary agreement on the question of forming a
      common state. The unity and fraternal alliance of the workers of
      all countries are incompatible with the use of force, direct or
      indirect, against other nationalities.

      § 11 to read:

Judges and other officials, both civil and military, to be
      elected by the people with the right to recall any of them at
      any time by decision of a majority of their electors.


      § 12 to read:

The police and standing army to be replaced by the universally
      armed people; workers and other employees to receive regular
      wages from the capitalists for the time devoted to public
      service in the people’s militia.


After the fiscal clause of the programme (following the words
      “on incomes and inheritances”) insert:

The high level of development of capitalism already achieved in
      banking and in the trustified branches of industry, on the one
      hand, and the economic disruption caused by the imperialist war,
      everywhere evoking a demand for state and public control of the
      production and distribution of all staple products, on the
      other, induce the Party to demand the nationalisation of the
      banks, syndicates (trusts), etc.

 

The agrarian programme to be formulated thus:

The beginning (from the words “In order to do away with the
      relics” to the words “the Party demands”) to be retained; the
      continuation to be amended as follows:

      1) Fights with all its strength for the immediate and complete
         confiscation of all landed estates in Russia (and also crown
         lands, church lands, etc.).

      2) Stands for the immediate transfer of all land to the
         peasantry organised in Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies or in
         other organs of local self-government elected on a truly
         democratic basis and completely independent of the landowners
         and bureaucrats.

      3) Demands the nationalisation of all lands in the country;
         nationalisation implies that all property rights in land are
         vested in the state, while the right of disposal of the land
         is vested in the local democratic institutions.

      4) Encourages the initiative of those peasant committees which,
         in various localities of Russia, are turning over the
         landowners’ livestock and agricultural implements to the
         peasants organised in these committees for the purpose of
         their socially regulated utilisation in the cultivation of
         the land.

      5) Advises the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians to
         strive towards turning every landed estate into a
         sufficiently large model farm, to be conducted on a communal
         basis by the local Soviet of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies
         under the direction of agricultural experts and with the aid
         of the best technical appliances.

The Party under all circumstances and whatever the conditions,
      etc.—to the end of the paragraph (“exploitation”).

The conclusion of the agrarian programme, from the words “The
      Party under all circumstances, and whatever the conditions of
      democratic agrarian reform may be” to the words “poverty and
      exploitation”, to remain unchanged.


The whole concluding part of the programme, the last two
      paragraphs (from the words “In the endeavour to achieve” to the
      end), to be entirely deleted.

       Comments on the Remarks Made by the Committee

    of the April All-Russia Conference
   

With regard to the remarks on the preamble to the programme, I
      must say the following.

In my opinion, there is no need for a revision of the entire
      preamble. The plan for such a revision proposed by the committee
      seems to me theoretically incorrect.

As now worded, the preamble contains a description and analysis
      of the main and essential features of capitalism as a social and
      economic system. Fundamentally, these features have not
      been changed by imperialism, by the era of finance
      capital. Imperialism is a continuation of the development of
      capitalism, its highest stage—in a sense, a transition
      stage to socialism.

I cannot therefore see how the addition of an analysis of
      imperialism to the general analysis of the basic features of
      capitalism can be regarded as “mechanical”. Imperialism, in
      fact, does not and cannot transform capitalism from top
      to bottom. Imperialism complicates and sharpens the
      contradictions of capitalism, it “ties up” monopoly with free
      competition, but it cannot do away with exchange, the
      market, competition, crises, etc.

Imperialism is moribund capitalism, capitalism which is dying
      but not dead. The essential feature of imperialism, by and
      large, is not monopolies pure and simple, but monopolies in
      conjunction with exchange, markets, competition, crises.

It is therefore theoretically wrong to delete an analysis of
      exchange, commodity production, crises, etc., in general and to
      “replace” it by an analysis of imperialism as a whole.

    

    
There is no such whole. There is a transition from
      competition to monopoly, and therefore the programme would be
      much more correct, and much more true to reality, if it retained
      the general analysis of exchange, commodity production, crises,
      etc., and had a characterisation of the growing
      monopolies added to it. In fact it is this combination of
      antagonistic principles, viz., competition and monopoly, that is
      the essence of imperialism, it is this that is making for the
      final crash, i.e., the socialist revolution.

Furthermore, in the case of Russia it would be wrong to present
      imperialism as a coherent whole (imperialism in general is an
      incoherent whole), since in Russia there are no few fields and
      branches of labour that are still in a state of transition from
      natural or semi-natural economy to capitalism. Backward and poor
      though they are, they nevertheless exist, and given the
      conditions, may introduce an element of delay in the collapse of
      capitalism.

The programme proceeds—as it should proceed—from the
      simplest phenomena of capitalism to the more complex and
      “higher” ones, from exchange to commodity production, to the
      ousting of small industries by the large ones, to crises and so
      forth, ending up in imperialism, that highest stage of
      capitalism, which is only now being reached in the advanced
      countries. That is how matters stand in actual reality. To begin
      by placing “exchange” in general in juxtaposition with the
      export of capital is incorrect historically and
      theoretically.

These are the comments I have to make on the remarks of the
      committee.

  The Old and New Texts of the Programme
   

To make it easier and more convenient for the reader to compare
      the old and new texts of the programme, both texts are printed
      together in the following manner:

Those parts of the old programme which remain unchanged in the
      new one are given in ordinary type.


Those parts of the old programme which are to be completely
      deleted from the new one are given in italics.


Those parts of the new programme which were not in the
      old programme are given in bold type.


  PROGRAMME OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY
   

The development of exchange has established such close Lies
      between all the nations of the civilised world that the great
      movement of the proletariat towards emancipation was bound to
      become—and has long since become—international.


Russian Social-Democracy regards itself as a detachment of the
      world army of the proletariat, and is working towards the same
      ultimate goal as the Social-Democrats of all other
      countries. This ultimate goal is determined by the character of
      modern bourgeois society and by the trend of its
      development. The principal specific feature of this society is
      commodity production based on capitalist production relations,
      under which the most important and major part of the means of
      production and exchange of commodities belongs to a numerically
      small class of persons while the vast majority of the population
      is made up of proletarians and semi-proletarians,

    

who, owing to
      their economic position, are compelled permanently or
      periodically to sell their labour-power, i.e., to hire themselves
      out to the capitalists and to create by their labour the incomes
      of the upper classes of society.


The ascendancy of capitalist production relations extends its
      area more and more with the steady improvement of technology,
      which, by enhancing the economic importance of the large
      enterprises, tends to eliminate the small independent producers,
      converting some of them into proletarians and narrowing the role
      of others in the social and economic sphere, and in some places
      making them more or less completely, more or less obviously,
      more or less painfully dependent on capital.


Moreover, this technical progress enables the employers to make
      growing use of female and child labour in the process of
      production and exchange of commodities. And since, on the other
      hand, it causes a relative decrease in the employers’ demand
      for human labour-power, the demand for labour-power necessarily
      lags behind its supply, as a result of which the dependence of
      wage-labour on capital is increased and exploitation of labour
      rises to a higher level.


This state of affairs in the bourgeois countries and the
      steadily growing competition among them in the world market make
      it more and more difficult for them to sell the goods which are
      produced in ever increasing quantities. Over-production,
      manifesting itself in more or less acute industrial crises
      followed by more or less protracted periods of industrial
      stagnation, is an inevitable consequence of the development of
      the productive forces in bourgeois society. Crises and periods
      of industrial stagnation, in their turn, still further ruin the
      small producers, still further increase the dependence of
      wage-labour on capital, and lead still more rapidly to the
      relative and sometimes to the absolute deterioration of the
      condition of the working class.


Thus, improvement in technology, signifying increased labour
      productivity and greater social wealth, becomes in bourgeois
      society the cause of greater social inequality, of widening
      gulfs between the rich and poor, of greater insecurity,
      unemployment, and various hardships of the mass of the working
      people.

 

However, in proportion as all these contradictions, which are
      inherent in bourgeois society, grow and develop, so also does
      the discontent of the toiling and exploited masses with the
      existing order of things grow; the numerical strength and
      solidarity of the proletarians increase and their struggle
      against their exploiters is sharpened. At the same time, by
      concentrating the means of production and exchange and
      socialising the process of labour in capitalist enterprises, the
      improvement in technology more and more rapidly creates the
      material possibility of capitalist production relations being
      superseded by socialist relations, i.e., the possibility of
      bringing about the social revolution, which is the ultimate aim
      of all the activities of international Social-Democracy as the
      conscious exponent of the class movement.


By introducing social in place of private ownership of the means
      of production and exchange, by introducing planned organisation
      of social production to ensure the well-being and many-sided
      development of all the members of society, the proletarian
      social revolution will do away with the division of society into
      classes and thereby emancipate the whole of oppressed humanity,
      for it will put an end to all forms of exploitation of one
      section of society by another.


A necessary condition for this social revolution is the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e., the conquest by the
      proletariat of such political power as will enable it to
      suppress all resistance on-the part of the exploiters. Aiming at
      making the proletariat capable of fulfilling its great historic
      mission, international Social-Democracy organises the
      proletariat in an independent political party opposed to all the
      bourgeois parties, guides all the manifestations of its class
      struggle, reveals to it the irreconcilable antagonism between
      the interests of the exploiters and those of the exploited, and
      explains to the proletariat the historical significance of and
      the necessary conditions for the impending social revolution. At
      the same time it reveals to all the other toiling and exploited
      masses the hopelessness of their position in capitalist society
      and the need for a social revolution if they are to free
      themselves from the yoke of capital. The Social-Democratic
      Party, the party of the working class, calls upon all section of
      the toiling and exploited population to join its ranks insofar
      as they adopt the standpoint of the proletariat.

 

World capitalism has at the present time, i.e., about the
beginning of the twentieth century, reached the stage of
imperialism. Imperialism, or the epoch of finance capital, is
a high stage of development of the capitalist economic system,
one in which monopolist associations of
      capitalists—syndicates, cartels, and trusts—have assumed
      decisive
importance; in which enormously concentrated banking capital
has fused with industrial capital; in which the ex port of
capital to foreign countries has assumed vast dimensions; in
which the whole world has been divided up territorially among
the richer countries, and the economic carve-up of the world
among international trusts has begun.


Imperialist wars, i.e., wars for world domination, for markets
for banking capital and for the subjugation of small and
weaker nations, are inevitable under such a state of
affairs. The first great imperialist war, the war of 1914–17,
is precisely such a war.


The extremely high level of development which world capitalism
in general has attained, the replacement of free competition
by monopoly capitalism, the fact that the banks and the
capitalist associations have prepared the machinery for the
social regulation of the process of production and
distribution of products, the rise in the cost of living and
increased oppression of the working class by the syndicates
due to the growth of capitalist monopolies, the tremendous
obstacles standing in the way of the proletariat’s economic
and political struggle, the horrors, misery, ruin, and
brutalisation caused by the imperialist war—all these
factors transform the present stage of capitalist development
into an era of proletarian socialist revolution.


That era has dawned.


Only a proletarian socialist revolution can lead humanity out
of the impasse which imperialism and imperialist wars have
created. Whatever difficulties the revolution may have to
encounter, whatever possible temporary setbacks or waves of
counter-revolution it may have to contend with, the final
victory of the proletariat is inevitable.


Objective conditions make it the urgent task of the day to
prepare the proletariat in every way for the conquest
    

of
political power in order to carry out the economic and
political measures which are the sum and substance of the
socialist revolution.



The fulfilment of this task, which calls for the fullest
trust, the closest fraternal ties, and direct unity of
revolutionary action on the part of the working class in all
the advanced countries, is impossible without an immediate
break in principle with the bourgeois perversion of
socialism, which has gained the upper hand among the leader
ship of the great majority of the official Social-Democratic
parties. Such a perversion is, on the one hand, the
social-chauvinist trend, socialism in word and chauvinism in
deed, the defence of the predatory interests of “one’s own”
national bourgeoisie under the guise of “defence of the
fatherland”; and, on the other hand, the equally wide
international trend of the so-called “Centre”, which stands
for unity with the social-chauvinists and for the preservation
or correction of the bankrupt Second International, and which
vacillates between social-chauvinism and the internationalist
revolutionary struggle of the proletariat for the achievement
of a socialist system.


On the path to their ultimate common goal, which is
      conditioned by preponderance of the capitalist mode of
      production throughout the civilised world, the Social-Democrats
      of different countries are obliged to set themselves dissimilar
      immediate tasks, both because the capitalist system is not
      developed everywhere to the same degree, and because in
      different countries it develops in a different social and
      political setting.


In Russia, where capitalism has already become the prevailing
mode of production, there are still numerous survivals of the
old, pre-capitalist order, which was based on the enslavement
of the working masses to the landowners, the state, or the
head of the state.


While greatly hampering economic progress, these survivals
also prevent the full development of the class struggle of the
proletariat; they help to preserve and intensify the most barbarous
        forms of exploitation of the peasant millions by the
state and the propertied classes and keep the people in a
state of ignorance and subjection.

 

The most important of these relics of the past, and the most
powerful bulwark of all this barbarism, is the tsarist
autocracy. By its very nature it is hostile to every social
movement and is bound to be the bitterest opponent of every
aspiration towards freedom on the part of the
proletariat.


In view of this, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
makes it its primary and immediate task to overthrow the
tsarist autocracy and set up in its place a democratic
republic whose constitution would guarantee the
following:


In Russia at the present moment, when the Provisional
Government, which is part and parcel of the capitalist class
and enjoys the confidence—necessarily unstable—of
the broad mass of the petty-bourgeois population, has undertaken to convene a Constituent Assembly, the immediate duty
of the party of the proletariat is to fight for a political
system which will best guarantee economic progress and the
rights of the people in general, and make possible the least
painful transition to socialism in particular.


The party of the proletariat cannot rest content with a
bourgeois parliamentary democratic republic, which throughout
the world preserves and strives to perpetuate the monarchist
instruments for the oppression of the masses, namely, the
police, the standing army, and the privileged
bureaucracy.


The party fights for a more democratic workers’ and peasants’
republic, in which the police and the standing army will be
abolished and replaced by the universally armed people, by a
people’s militia; all officials will be not only elective, but
also subject to recall at any time upon the demand of a
majority of the electors; all officials, without exception,
will be paid at a rate not exceeding the average wage of a
competent worker; parliamentary representative institutions
will be gradually replaced by Soviets of people’s
representatives (from various classes and professions, or from
various localities), functioning as both legislative and
executive bodies.


The constitution of the Russian democratic republic must
      ensure:


1) The sovereignty of the people; supreme power in the state
           must be vested entirely in the people’s representatives,
           who shall be elected by the people and be subject
    

to recall
           at any time, and who shall constitute a single popular
           assembly, a single chamber.


1) The sovereignty of the people, i.e., the concentration of
      supreme state power entirely in the hands of a legislative
      assembly, consisting of the representatives of the people and
      constituting a single chamber.


      2) Universal, equal, and direct suffrage for all citizens, men
         and women, who have reached the age of twenty, in the
         elections to the legislative assembly and to the various
         bodies of local self-government; secret ballot; the right of
         every voter to be elected to any representative institution;
         biennial parliaments; salaries to be paid to the people’s



         representatives; proportional representation at all
         elections; all delegates and elected officials, without
         exception, to be subject to recall at any time upon the
         decision of a majority of their electors.


      3) Local self-government on a broad scale; regional self-
         government in localities where the composition of the
         population and living and social conditions are of a specific
         nature; the abolition of all state-appointed local
         and regional authorities. 


      4) Inviolability of person and domicile.


      5) Unrestricted freedom of conscience, speech, the press,
         assembly, strikes, and association.


      6) Freedom of movement and occupation.


      7) Abolition of the social estates; equal rights for all
         citizens irrespective of sex, creed, race, or
         nationality.


      8) The right of the population to receive instruction in their
         native tongue in schools to be established for the purpose at
         the expense of the state and local organs of self-government;
         the right of every citizen to use his native language at
         meetings; the native language to be used on a level with
         the official language in all local public and state
         institutions; the obligatory official language to be
         abolished.


      9) The right of self-determination for all member nations of the
state.

9) The right of all member nations of the state to freely
secede and form independent states. The republic of the
Russian nation must attract other nations or nationalities not
by force, but exclusively by voluntary agreement on the
question of forming a common state. The unity and
    

fraternal
alliance of the workers of all countries are incompatible with
the use of force, direct or indirect, against other
nationalities.


      10) The right of all persons to sue any official in the regular
          way before a jury.


11) Election of judges by the people.


11) Judges and other officials, both civil and military, to be
            elected by the people with the right to recall any of them
            at any time by decision of a majority of their
            electors. 


12) Replacement of the standing army by the universally
      armed people.


12) The police and standing army to be
replaced by the
universally armed people; workers and other employees to
receive regular wages from the capitalists for the time
devoted to public service in the people’s militia. 


      13) Separation of the church from the state, and schools from
          the church; schools to be absolutely
          secular. 


14) Free and compulsory general and vocational education for
      all children of both sexes up to the age of sixteen; poor
      children to be provided with food, clothing, and school Supplies
      at the expense of the state.


14) Free and compulsory general and polytechnical education
            (familiarising the student with the theoretical and
            practical aspects of the most important fields of
            production) for all children of both sexes up to the age
            of sixteen; training of children to be closely integrated
            with socially productive work.


15) All students to be provided with food, clothing, and
school supplies at the cost of the state.


16) Public education to be administered by democratically
elected organs of local self-government; the central
government not to be allowed to interfere with the arrangement
of the school curriculum, or with the selection of the
teaching staffs; teachers to be elected directly by the
population with the right of the latter to remove undesirable
teachers.
      


As a basic condition for the democratisation of our country’s
      national economy, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
      demands the abolition of all indirect taxes and the
      establishment of a progressive tax on incomes and
      inheritances.

 

The high level of development of capitalism already achieved
in banking and in the trustified branches of industry, on the
one hand, and the economic disruption caused by the
imperialist war, everywhere evoking a demand for state and
public control of the production and distribution of all
staple products, on the other, induce the Party to demand the
nationalisation of the banks, syndicates (trusts),
etc. 


To safeguard the working class from physical and moral
      deterioration, and develop its ability to carry on the struggle
      for emancipation, the Party demands:


1) An eight-hour working day for all wage-workers.


1) An eight-hour working day for all wage-workers, including a
           break of not less than one hour for meals where work is
           continuous. In dangerous and unhealthy industries the
           working day to be reduced to from four to six
           hours.


      2) A statutory weekly uninterrupted rest period of not less than
         forty-two hours for all wage-workers of both sexes in all
         branches of the national economy.


      3) Complete prohibition of overtime work.


4) Prohibition of night-work (from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.) in all

           the labour organisations.


4) Prohibition of night-work (from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.)in all
           branches of the national economy except in cases where it
           is absolutely necessary for technical reasons endorsed by
           the labour organisations—provided, however, that
           night-work does not exceed four hours.


5) Prohibition of the employment of children of school age
           (under sixteen) and restriction of the working day of
           adolescents (from sixteen to eighteen) to six hours.

           school age (under sixteen), restriction of the
           working day of adolescents (from sixteen to twenty) to four

         for four weeks before and six weeks after child-birth without
         loss of pay.

           women; women to be released from work eight weeks before
           and eight weeks after child-birth without loss of pay and
           with free medical and medicinal aid.


7) Establishment of nurseries for infants and young children at
         all factories and other enterprises where women are employed;
         nursing mothers to be allowed recesses of at least half-hour
         duration at intervals of not more than three hours.


7) Establishment of nurseries for infants and young children
           and rooms for nursing mothers at all factories and other
           enterprises where women are employed; nursing mothers to be
           allowed recesses of at least half-hour duration at
           intervals of not more than three hours; such mothers to
           receive nursing benefit and their working day to be reduced
           to six hours.

           partial disablement out of a special fund formed by a
           special tax on the capitalists.

           pay-days to be fixed in all labour contracts without
           exception and wages to be paid in cash and during working
           hours.


10) Prohibition of deductions by employers from wages on any
            pretext or for any purpose whatsoever (fines, spoilage,
            etc.).


11) Appointment of an adequate number of factory inspectors in
            all branches of the national economy; factory inspection
            to be extended to all enterprises employing hired labour,
            including government enterprises (domestic service also to
            be liable to inspection); women inspectors to be appointed
            in Industries where female labour is employed;
representatives
    

elected by the workers and paid by the
            state to supervise the enforcement of the factory laws,
            the fixing of rates and the passing or rejection of raw
            materials and finished products.


9) The establishment of a labour inspectorate elected by the
           workers’ organisations and covering all enterprises

           labour is employed. 


12) Local self-governing bodies, assisted by representatives
            elected by the workers, to inspect sanitary conditions at
            dwellings assigned to workers by employers, as well as the
            internal regulations in force in such dwellings and the
            renting conditions, in order to protect wage-workers
            against interference by employers in their life and
            activities as private citizens.


13) The establishment of properly organised sanitary control
            over all enterprises employing hired labour, the whole
            system of medical aid and sanitary inspection to be
            entirely independent of the employers; free medical aid to
            the workers at the expense of the employers, with full pay
            during sickness.


14) Employers violating the labour protection laws to be
            liable to criminal prosecution.


10) Sanitary laws to be enacted for improving hygienic
            conditions and protecting the life and health of workers
            in all enterprises where hired labour is employed;
            questions of hygiene to be handled by the sanitary
            inspectorate elected by the workers’
            organisations.


11) Housing laws to be enacted and a housing inspectorate
            elected by the workers’ organisations to be instituted for
            the purpose of sanitary inspection of dwelling
            houses. However, only by abolishing private property in
            land and building cheap and hygienic dwellings can the
            housing problem be solved.


12) Industrial courts to be established in all branches of the
            national economy.


15) Industrial courts to be established in
all branches of the national economy, composed of equal numbers of
representatives from the workers’ and employers’
organisations.


16) Employment bureau (labour exchanges) to be established by
the organs of local self-government in all industries for the
hire of local and non-local workers; representatives of
    

the
workers and employers to participate In their
administration.


13) Labour exchanges to be established for the proper
            organisation of work-finding facilities. These labour ex
            changes must be proletarian class organisations (organised
            on a non-parity basis), and must be closely associated
            with the trade unions and other working-class
            organisations and financed by the communal self-governing
            bodies.
      


In order to do away with the relics of serfdom, which are a
      heavy yoke on the necks of the peasants, and to enable the class
      struggle to develop freely in the countryside, the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party demands:


1) The abolition of all personal and property restrictions
           Imposed on the peasants by the existing system of social
           estates.


2) The abolition of all charges and duties involved in the
           social-estate status of the peasants, and the annulment of
           all debt obligations having the nature of a usurious
           contract.


3) The confiscation of church, monastery, and crown lands and
           their transfer (together with state lands) to the control
           of the higher organs of local self-government embracing
           urban and rural districts; resettlement lands and also
           forests and waters of national importance to be transferred
           to the democratic state.


4) The confiscation of privately-owned lands other than small
           holdings, and their transfer to the control of the higher,
           democratically elected organs of local self-government. The
           minimum size of a confiscatable land holding to be
           determined by the higher organs of local
           self-government.



While supporting revolutionary action on the part of the
peasantry, including confiscation of the landed estates, the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party will always oppose any
attempt to check the course of economic development. Though it
stands for the transfer of confiscated lands to the democratic
organs of local self-government in the event of a victorious
development of the revolution, the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party will, if circumstances prove unfavourable for
such a transfer, declare itself in favour of dividing among
the peasants those lands belonging to the landowners on which
small-scale farming has been conducted or which are made up of
complement farm lands.

 

1) Fights with all its strength for the immediate and complete
           confiscation of all landed estates in Russia (and also
           crown lands, church lands, etc.).


2) Stands for the immediate transfer of all land to the
           peasantry organised in Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies or in
           other organs of local self-government elected on a truly
           democratic basis and completely independent of the
           landowners and bureaucrats.


3) Demands the nationalisation of all lands in the country;
           nationalisation implies that all property rights in land
           are vested in the state, while the right of disposal of the
           land is vested in the local democratic
           institutions.


4) Encourages the initiative of those peasant committees
           which, in various localities of Russia, are turning over
           the landowners’ livestock and agricultural implements to
           the peasants organised in these committees for the purpose
           of their socially regulated utilisation in the cultivation
           of the land.


5) Advises the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians to
           strive towards turning every landed estate into a
           sufficiently large model farm, to be conducted on a
           communal basis by the local Soviet of Agricultural
           Labourers’ Deputies under the direction of agricultural
           experts and with the aid of the least technical
           appliances.


Furthermore, the Party under all circumstances, and
      whatever the conditions of democratic agrarian reform may be,
      will unswervingly work for the independent class organisation of
      the rural proletariat, will explain to the latter the
      irreconcilable antagonisms that exist between it and the peasant
      bourgeoisie, will warn it against the false attraction of the
      system of petty farming, which, while commodity production
      exists, can never do away with the poverty of the masses, and,
      finally, will urge the need for a complete socialist revolution
      as the only means of abolishing poverty and exploitation.


In the endeavour to achieve its immediate aims, the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party supports every oppositional and
      revolutionary movement directed against the existing social and
      political set-up in Russia, but at the same time emphatically
      rejects all reformist projects involving any
    

expansion or
      consolidation of the guardianship of the police and bureaucracy
      over the labouring masses.


For its part, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
is firmly convinced that the full, consistent, and firm
realisation of all these political and social reforms can be
achieved only by the overthrow of the autocracy and by the
convocation of a Constituent Assembly freely elected by the
entire people.

 Draft Resolution on the Agrarian Question
   

      1) All landed estates and privately-owned lands, as well as
         crown and church lands, etc., are to be turned over
         immediately to the people without any compensation.

      2) The peasantry must in an organised manner, through their
         Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, immediately take over all the
         land in their localities for the purpose of its economic
         exploitation, without however in any way prejudicing thereby
         the final establishment of land regulations by the
         Constituent Assembly or by the All-Russia Council of Soviets,
         should the people decide to vest the central power of the
         state in such a Council of Soviets.

      3) Private property in land must be abolished altogether, i.e.,
         all the land shall belong only to the nation as a whole, and
         its disposal shall be placed in the hands of the local
         democratic institutions.

      4) The peasants must reject the advice of the capitalists and
         landowners and their Provisional Government to come to “an
         agreement” with the local landowners on the immediate
         disposal of the land; the disposal of all the land must be
         governed by the organised decision of the majority of the
         local peasants, and not by an agreement between the majority,
         i.e., the peasants, and the minority, and an insignificant
         minority at that, i.e., the landowners.

      5) Not only the landowners are fighting and will continue to
         fight as hard as they can against the transfer of all landed
         estates to the peasants without compensation, but also the
         capitalists, who wield great power both because of their
         money and because of their influence on the as yet
         unenlightened

    

masses through the newspapers and the numerous
         officials, employees, etc., who are accustomed to the
         domination of capital. Hence, the transfer of all the landed
         estates to the peasantry without compensation cannot be
         carried through on a complete and secure basis unless the
         confidence of the peasant masses in the capitalists Is
         destroyed, unless a close alliance is established between the
         peasantry and the urban workers, and unless state power is
         taken over completely by the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’,
         Peasants’, and other Deputies. Only state power wielded by
         such Soviets and administering the state not through a
         police, or a bureaucracy, or a standing army isolated from
         the people, but through a nation-wide, universal and armed
         militia of the workers and peasants, can guarantee the
         realisation of the above-mentioned agrarian reforms, which
         are being demanded by the entire peasantry.

      6) Agricultural labourers and poor peasants, i.e., those who,
         because of the lack of sufficient land, cattle, and
         implements, earn a living partly by working for hire, must
         strive their hardest to organise themselves independently
         into separate Soviets, or into separate groups within the
         general peasants’ Soviets, in order to protect their
         interests against the rich peasants, who inevitably strive
         towards an alliance with the capitalists and landowners.

      7) As a result of the war, Russia, like all other belligerent
         and many neutral (non-belligerent) countries, is facing an
         economic debacle, disaster and famine owing to the shortage
         of workers, coal, iron, etc. The only way to save the country
         is by the workers’ and peasants’ deputies assuming control
         and management of the entire production and distribution of
         goods. It is therefore necessary to proceed immediately to
         arrange agreements between Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies and
         Soviets of Workers’ Deputies on the exchange of grain and
         other rural products for implements, footwear, clothing,
         etc., without the medium of the capitalists, who must be
         removed from the management of the factories. With the same
         purpose in view, the peasant committees must be encouraged to
         take over the livestock and implements of the landowners,
         such livestock and implements to be used in
         common. Similarly, the conversion of all large landed estates
         into model farms must be encouraged, the

    

land to be
         cultivated collectively with the aid of the best implements
         under the ’direction of agricultural experts and in
         accordance with the decision of the local Soviets of
         Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.

      Speech on the Agrarian Question

   May 22 (June 4), 1917
   

Comrades, the resolution that I am privileged to present to you
      in the name of the Social-Democratic group of the Peasants’
      Soviet has been printed and distributed to the delegates. If any
      delegates have not received it we shall have more copies printed
      tomorrow for distribution to all who wish to have them.

In a short report I can, of course, deal only with the main,
      basic questions, those that are of greatest interest to the
      peasantry and the working class. To those interested in the
      question in greater detail, I can recommend the resolution of our Party, the
      Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks), published
      as a Supplement to Soldatskaya Pravda No. 13,
      and repeatedly dealt with in our newspaper
Pravda.[1]

At
      the moment I shall have to confine myself to elucidating the
      more important points of my resolution and of our Party
      programme on the agrarian question that are most controversial
      or give rise to misunderstanding. One of the first of these
      debatable points is that touched upon yesterday or the day
      before in the Chief
      Land
Committee[3] at the session you have probably heard about
      or read about in the newspapers of yesterday or the day
      before. That session of the Chief Land Committee was attended by
      a representative of our Party, Comrade Smilga, a colleague of
      mine on

    

the Central Committee. He proposed to the session that
      the Chief Land Committee should express itself in favour of the
      immediate organised seizure by the peasants of the landed
      estates, but a number of violent objections were raised to
      Comrade Smilga’s proposal. (Voice: “Here, too.”) I am
      now told that a number of comrades here will also speak against
      that proposal. All the more reason for my clarifying that point
      in our programme, because I believe that most of the objections
      against our programme are based on a misunderstanding or
      misrepresentation of our views.

What do all our Party resolutions, all the articles in our
      newspaper Pravda say? We say that all the land, without
      exception, must become the property of the whole nation. We have
      come to this conclusion after having studied, in particular, the
      peasant movement of 1905 and the statements made by peasant
      deputies to the First and Second Dumas, where many peasant
      deputies from all over Russia were able to speak with
      relative—relative, of course—freedom.

All the land must be the property of the whole nation. From this
      it follows that in advocating the immediate transfer, without
      payment, of the landed estates to the local peasants we do not
      by any means advocate the seizure of those estates as private
      property, we do not by any means advocate the division of those
      estates. We believe the land should be taken by the local
      peasantry for one sowing in accordance with a decision adopted
      by the majority of local peasant deputies. We do not by any
      means advocate the transfer of this land as private property to
      those peasants who are now taking it for one sowing. All
      objections of this kind to our proposal that I am constantly
      hearing and reading in the columns of the capitalist newspapers
      are based on a sheer misinterpretation of our views. Since we
      have said—and I repeat: we have said that in all our
      resolutions—that the land must be the property of the whole
      nation and must be taken over by it without payment—it is
      obvious that arrangements for the final disposal of the land,
      the final establishment of land regulations must be made only by
      a central state power, that is, by a Constituent Assembly or an
      All-Russia Council of Soviets, should the masses of peas ants
      and workers establish such state power as a Council

    

of
      Soviets. On this score there are no differences of opinion. 

The
      differences begin after this, when we are told: “If
      that is so, then any immediate uncompensated transfer of the
      landed estates to the peasantry would be an unauthorised act.”
      That is the view that was expressed most exactly, most
      authoritatively and most weightily by Minister of Agriculture
      Shingaryov in his well-known telegram; we consider this view to
      be fallacious, unfair, most prejudicial to the peasantry,
      prejudicial to the farmers, and the least likely to ensure the
      country a supply of grain. Allow me to read that telegram to
      show you what we mostly object to.


      “An independent solution of the land question in the absence of
      a general state law is inadmissible. Arbitrary action will lead
      to a national calamity ... the lawful solution of the land
      question is the business of the Constituent Assembly. At the
      present time agricultural conciliation chambers have been set up
      by the tillers of the land and the landowners in each local area
      under the rural supply committees.” 


This is the chief passage from the government’s statement on
      this question. If you acquaint yourselves with the resolution of
      the Chief Land Committee on this question adopted yesterday or
      the day before, and the resolution adopted, also the other day,
      at a private meeting of Duma deputies, you will see that the two
      resolutions proceed from the same viewpoint. The peasants who
      want land handed over immediately to the peasants without
      payment and distributed by local peasant committees are accused
      of unauthorised acts on the assumption that only a voluntary
      agreement between peasants and landowners, between the tillers
      and the owners of the land, would be in accordance with the
      needs and interests of the state. That is what we deny, that is
      what we dispute.

Let us examine the objections raised to our proposal.

The usual objections are that the land in Russia is distributed
      very unevenly, both between individual small units such as
      villages and volosts and between the bigger units such as gubernias
      and regions. It is said that if the local population were to
      take over the land by a majority decision against the will of
      the landowners and without payment at that, the unevenness would
      remain and there would even be a danger of it becoming
      perpetuated. We say in reply that this argument

    

is based on a
      misunderstanding. The uneven distribution will remain in any
      case until the Constituent Assembly or some other central state
      power finally establishes a new system. Until such a system is
      established the uneven distribution will remain whether the
      question is settled in the peas ant’s or in the landowner’s way,
      whether in our way, with the immediate transfer of the land to
      the peasants, or in the way of the landowners, who are prepared
      to lease their land out at a high rent provided the tenant
      farmer and the landowner each retains his own rights. This
      objection is obviously incorrect and unjust. We say that a
      central state power must be established as quickly as possible,
      one that not only relies on the will and the decision of the
      peas ant majority, but also directly expresses the opinion of
      that majority. There are no differences on this score. When we
      hear objections to the Bolsheviks, attacks levelled against us
      in the capitalist newspapers accusing us of being anarchists, we
      repudiate such accusations most emphatically and regard them as
      an attempt to spread malicious lies and slander.

Anarchists are those who deny the need for a state power,
      whereas we say that a state power is absolutely necessary, not
      only for Russia today but for any state, even one that goes over
      directly to socialism. Without doubt the firmest possible
      authority is necessary. All we want is for that power to be
      wholly and exclusively in the hands of the majority of workers’,
      soldiers’, and peasants’ deputies. That is where we differ from
      other parties. By no means do we deny the need for a firm state
      power; we only say that all landed estates must pass into the
      hands of the peasants without payment, in accordance with a
      decision of the local peasant committee adopted by the majority,
      and on the condition that no damage is done to property. This is
      stated most explicitly in our resolution. We emphatically reject
      any allegation that our view implies an arbitrary act.

In our opinion, on the contrary, if the landowners keep back the
      land for their own use or charge money for it, that is an
      arbitrary act, but if the majority of peasants say that the
      landed estates must not remain in the hands of their owners, and
      that the peasantry has known nothing but oppression by those
      landowners for decades, for centuries, that is not

    

arbitrary,
      that is the restitution of justice, and we cannot put
      off that restitution. If the land is transferred to the peas
      ants immediately the unevenness among the regions cannot be
      eliminated, that is indisputable; but nobody can eliminate that
      unevenness until the Constituent Assembly meets. If you were to
      ask Shingaryov today—that same Shingaryov who raises
      objections to us and reviles the champions of our views in
      official papers for “arbitrary action”—if you were to ask
      him what he proposes to do about that unevenness, he would be
      unable to answer you. He does not and cannot propose
      anything.

He speaks about “voluntary agreement between peasants and
      landowners”. What does that mean? I will cite two basic figures
      on landownership in European Russia. These figures show that at
      one end of the Russian village there are the most wealthy
      landowners, among them the Romanovs, the richest and the worst
      of landowners, and at the other end are the extremely poor
      peasants. I am citing two figures to show you the significance
      of the sermon preached by Shingaryov and all landowners and
      capitalists. These are the two figures: if we take the richest
      landowners of European Russia, we shall see that the biggest of
      them, numbering less than 30,000, own about 70,000,000 dessiatines
      of land. That works out at over 2,000 dessiatines each. If you
      take the upper crust of rich Russian landowners, irrespective of
      what social estate they belong to (most of them are nobles, but
      there are other landowners as well), you find that there are
      30,000 of them and they own 70,000,000 dessiatines! And if you
      take the poor peasants according to the same 1905 Census, which
      is the latest available information gathered uniformly
      throughout Russia—information, which, like all statistics
      gathered in tsarist times by tsarist civil servants, is none too
      trustworthy, although it does give some approximation of the
      truth, some data can be compared—if you take the poor
      peasantry you get 10,000,000 households owning from 70,000,000
      to 75,000,000 dessiatines of land. This means that one person
      has over 2,000 dessiatines and the other seven and a half
      dessiatines per household! And they say the peasants are guilty
      of arbitrary acts if they do not enter into a voluntary
      agreement. What is meant by “voluntary agreement”? It means that
      the landowners may perhaps let

    

you have land for a good rent but
      will not give it up to any body without payment. Is that just?
      Of course it is not. Is that profitable to the peasant
      population? Of course it is not. The form in which landed
      property will ultimately be established is for the future
      central state authority to decide, but at the present time the
      landed estates must be immediately transferred to the peasantry
      without compensation, provided the seizure is
      organised. Minister Chernov, opposing my colleague Smilga in the
      Chief Land Committee, said that the two words “organised
      seizure” are a contradiction in terms; if it’s a seizure, then
      it is unorganised, and if it’s organised, then it is not a
      seizure. I do not think this criticism is correct. I think that
      if the peasantry make a majority decision in any village or
      volost, any uyezd or gubernia—in some gubernias, if not
      all, the peasant congresses have set up local authorities
      representing the interests and will of the majority, the will of
      the population, i.e., of the majority of the tillers of the
      soil—once these authorities are set up in the localities
      the decision they make will be the decision of authorities
      recognised by the peas ants. The local peasantry are certain to
      respect these authorities, for there is no doubt that these
      freely elected authorities will decide that the landed estates
      must immediately pass into the hands of the peasants. Let the
      peasant know that he is taking the estate of the landowner, and
      if he pays anything, let him pay it into a local peasant fund,
      and let him know that the money will go towards farm
      improvements, paving and road building, etc. Let him know that
      the land he is taking is not his land, nor is it
      the land owner’s, but the common property of the
      people, which the Constituent Assembly will, in the end, dispose
      of. For this reason the landowners must have no right to the
      land from the very beginning of the revolution, from the moment
      the first land committee was set up, and no payment should be
      required for it.

The basic difference between ourselves and our-opponents is in
      our respective understanding of what order is and what law
      is. Up to now law and order have been regarded as things that
      suited the landowners and bureaucrats, but we maintain that law
      and order are things that suit the majority of the
      peasantry. Until there is an All-Russia Council of Soviets,

    

until there is a Constituent Assembly, local
      authority—uyezd and gubernia committees—constitutes
      the supreme law and order! We call it lawlessness when one
      landowner, on the basis of ancient rights, demands a “voluntary”
      agreement with three hundred peasant families who have an
      average of seven and a half dessiatines of land each! We say:
      “Let a decision be taken by the majority; we want the peasants
      to obtain the landed estates now, without losing a single month,
      a single week or even a single day.” 

We are told: “If the peasants seize the land now, It is the
      richer peasants who will get it, those who have animals,
      implements, etc.; would this, therefore, not be dangerous from
      the point of view of the poor peasants?” Comrades, I must dwell
      on this argument, because our Party, in all our decisions,
      programmes and appeals to the people, declares:


      “We are the party of wage-workers and poor peasants; it is their
      interests we are out to protect; it is through them, and through
      them alone, through those classes, that mankind can escape the
      horrors into which the capitalists’ war has plunged it.” 

To objections like these, claiming that our decisions are
      contrary to the interests of the poor peasants, we pay careful
      attention and invite a most careful study of them because they
      touch the very heart of the matter, the very root of the
      problem. And the heart of the matter Is this: how can the
      interests of the wage-workers, both urban and rural, and the
      interests of the poor peasants be protected in the revolution,
      in the transformation of the political system, that is now
      taking place in Russia, how can and should their interests be
      protected against those of the landowners or rich peasants who
      are also capitalists? That, of course, is the crux of the
      matter, the nub of the whole problem. But we are told that if we
      advise the peasants to seize the land immediately, it is those
      who have implements and animals who will mostly do the seizing
      and the poor will be left out of the picture. And now I ask
      you—will a voluntary agreement with the landowners
      help?

You know very well that the landowners are not anxious to rent
      out land to those peasants who have not got a kopek in their
      pockets, but, on the contrary, resort to “voluntary” agreements
      where they are promised substantial payment.

    


Up to now the landowners do not seem to have been giving their
      land away for nothing—at least nobody in Russia ever
      noticed it.

To speak of voluntary agreements with the landowners means
      greatly increasing and consolidating the privileged,
      preferential position and the advantages enjoyed by the rich
      peasant, because the rich peasant can certainly pay the land
      owner and every landowner regards him as a person who is good
      for his money. The landowner knows that the rich peasant can pay
      and that he can be sued for the money, so that the rich peasant
      has more to gain by such “voluntary” deals with the landowners
      than the poor peasant. If there is any possibility of helping
      the poor peasant straight away, it is by a measure such as I
      propose—the land must go to the peasants immediately and
      without payment.

Landed estates always have been and will be a flagrant
      injustice. The free tenure of that land by the peasants, if the
      tenure is in accordance with the will of the majority, ’will not
      be an arbitrary act but a restitution of justice. That is our
      point of view, and that is why we consider the argument that the
      poor peasantry would lose by it to be a great injustice. The
      agreement is called “voluntary”—only Shingaryov could call
      it that—when one landowner has 2,000 dessiatines and 300
      peasants have an average of seven and a half per family. To call
      such an agreement voluntary is sheer mockery of the
      peasants. For the peasant it is not a voluntary agreement, but a
      compulsory one, and will be such until every volost, gubernia or
      uyezd peasant Soviet or the All-Russia Council of Soviets
      declares that the landed estates are a gross injustice and that
      they must be abolished without losing a single hour, a single
      minute.

The land must be the property of the entire people, and must be
      declared such by a central state power. Until that power is
      established, the local authorities, I again repeat, should take
      over the landed estates and should do so In an organised manner
      according to the will of the majority. It. Is not true, as the
      newspapers assert, that disorder reigns in Russia! It isn’t
      true—there is greater order in the country side than ever
      before, because majority decisions are being

    

made; there have
      been scarcely any acts of violence against tile landowners;
      unfair treatment of the landowners has occurred only in isolated
      cases; they are insignificant and in Russia as a whole are not
      more in number than those which formerly occurred.

Now I want to mention another argument that I have heard and had
      occasion to deal with in our newspaper Pravda in
      connection with the immediate transfer of the land to the
peasantry.[2]


The argument is
      this: It we advise the peasants to take over the landed estates
      immediately and without payment, this will cause discontent,
      annoyance and anxiety and perhaps even indignation among the
      soldiers at the front who may say, “If the peasants take the
      land now and we have to stay at the front, we shall be left
      without land.” Perhaps the soldiers would all leave the front
      and chaos and anarchy would result. But in answer to this we say
      that this objection has nothing to do with the real issue;
      whether the land is taken for payment, by agreement with the
      landowners, or by a decision of the majority of the peasantry,
      in either case the soldiers will remain at the front and will
      certainly remain there as long as the war lasts and will not be
      able to return to their villages. Why should the soldiers at the
      front not be anxious about the landowners imposing unfavourable
      terms in the form of a voluntary agreement, why should they be
      anxious about the peasants making a majority decision against
      the landowners? Why should the soldier at the front place his
      trust in the landowner, in a “voluntary” agreement with the
      landowner? I can understand the political parties of the
      landowners and capitalists talking like this, but I do not
      believe that the Russian soldier at the front sees it that
      way. If there is a “voluntary” agreement with the landowner,
      tile soldier will not call it good order, will not place his
      trust in it, or is more likely to see in it a continuation of
      the old disorder that existed under the landowners.


If

      the soldier is told that the land is being taken over by the
      people, that the local peasants are renting land and

    

paying
      rent, not to the landowner but to their own committee for the
      common good, for those very soldiers at the front, and not for
      the landowner, he is more likely to have faith in this. If this
      is a majority decision, the soldier at the front will know that
      there cannot be any “voluntary” agreements with landowners, that
      the landowners are also citizens with equal rights whom nobody
      wishes to wrong; the land belongs to the entire nation,
      consequently it belongs also to the landowner, not as a
      privilege of the nobility, but in the same way as it belongs to
      any other citizen. From the day the power of the tsar was
      overthrown—a tsar who was the biggest landowner and
      oppressor of the masses—there must be no privileges for the
      landowners. With the establishment of liberty, the power of the
      landowners must be considered overthrown once and for all. The
      soldier at the front does not stand to lose anything from this
      point of view; on the contrary, he will have much greater faith
      in the state authorities, he will not worry about his household
      or about his family being treated unjustly or being
      neglected.

There remains one other objection that has been raised to our
      proposal. This argument is that if the peasants were to seize
      the landed estates immediately, such immediate, poorly prepared
      seizure might lead to a deterioration in the tilling and sowing
      of the land. I must say that a government of the majority, a
      central state power, has not yet been established, the peasants
      have not yet acquired sufficient confidence in themselves and
      have not lost their trust in the landowners and capitalists; I
      believe that we are drawing closer to this day by day, that the
      peasantry are day by day losing their confidence in the old
      state power and realising that only the peasants’, soldiers’,
      workers’ and other elected deputies and nobody else can
      constitute the government in Russia; I believe that every
      passing day brings us closer to this, not because any political
      party has advised it—millions of people will never listen
      to the advice of parties if that advice does not fall in with
      their own experience. We are rapidly approaching the time when
      there will be no other state power in Russia except the power of
      the representatives of the peasants and workers. When I am told
      that the immediate seizure of the land is likely to lead to

    

its
      being poorly cultivated, that the sowing will be poor, I must
      say that our peasants cultivate the land very poorly because of
      their downtrodden condition, because of centuries of oppression
      by the landowners. There is, of course, a fearful crisis in
      Russia, a crisis that has hit her as it has other belligerent
      countries, and Russia can only weather it by better cultivation
      of the land and the greatest economy of manpower. But today, at
      the time of the first sowing of crops, can anything be changed
      by “voluntary” agreements with the landowners? Are we to
      understand that the land owners will better look after the
      cultivation of the soil, that the peasants will sow worse if
      they know they are sowing land which is the property of the
      whole people and not of the landowner? If they pay rent into
      their own peasant funds and not to the landowner? This is such
      nonsense that I am astonished to hear such arguments; it is
      absolutely unbelievable and is nothing but a ruse on the part of
      the landowners.

The landowners realise that they can no longer rule by means of
      the big stick; they realise that very well, and are adopting a
      form of rule that is new to Russia but which has existed for a
      long time in Western Europe, in the West-European
      countries. Two revolutions in Russia have shown that the rule of
      the stick is no longer possible, and in the West-European
      countries dozens of revolutions have demonstrated it. Those
      revolutions have taught the landowners and capitalists a lesson;
      they have taught them that they have to rule the people by
      deception, by flattery; that they have to adapt themselves, wear
      a red badge on their jackets, and, sharks though they are,
      declare: “We are revolutionary democrats, please wait a bit and
      we’ll do everything for you.” The argument that the peasants will
      make a worse job of the sowing now if they sow land which no
      longer belongs to the landowners but is national property, is
      simply making fun of the peasants, it is an attempt to maintain
      rule over them by means of deception.

I repeat—there must be no landed proprietorship at all;
      tenure is not proprietorship, tenure is a temporary measure and
      it changes from year to year. The peasant who rents a plot of
      land does not dare regard the land as his own. The land is not
      his nor the landowner’s, it belongs to the people.

    


I repeat that this cannot make the sowing of crops this year,
      this spring, any worse. That assumption is so monstrous and
      improbable that there is only one thing for me to
      say—beware of the landowners, do not trust them, do not be
      taken in by fair words and promises. It must be remembered that
      a decision made by a majority of peasants, who are careful
      enough in making decisions, is a lawful decision of state
      significance. In this respect the peasants are to be relied
      upon. I have, for example, a decision passed by Penza peasants
      which is worded throughout with extraordinary caution; the
      peasants are not planning any immediate changes for the whole of
      Russia, but they do not want to place them selves in intolerable
      bondage, and in this they are right. The greatest bondage was
      that of the peasant to the landowner, and such it remains,
      bondage to the landowners and oppressors. The abolition of that
      bondage, therefore, must not be put off for a single week, even
      a single hour; but every seizure must be an organised seizure,
      not to make property of the seized land, not to divide it up,
      but to use it in common, as the property of the ’whole
      people.

I could finish with this question of the seizure of land by
      answering that the objections against our proposal are based on
      deception when they come from the landowners and capitalists,
      and on misunderstanding, on a too credulous belief in what the
      landowners and capitalists say untruthfully against us when they
      come from those who are neither land owners nor capitalists but
      people who have the interests of the working people at heart. If
      you examine our arguments you will see that the just demand that
      the landed estates be abolished immediately and similarly that
      property in land belong to the people cannot be put into effect
      until a central government is established, but what we do
      advise, and urge most insistently, is that the peasants
      themselves, right on the spots in the localities, take over the
      land so as to avoid any breach of good order. We offer this
      advice in our resolutions, but perhaps it is superfluous, since
      the peasants are doing this without our advice.

I shall pass to the second question, the one to which the
      greatest attention should be drawn, the question of what we
      think should be done with the land in the best interests of the
      masses when it becomes the property of the whole



people,

    

when
      private property is abolished. That time is close at hand in
      Russia. In fact, the landowners’ power, if not destroyed, has
      been undermined. When all the peasants are in possession of the
      land, when there are no landowners, how are we to distribute the
      land? It seems to me that we must have some sort of common,
      basic view on this question, be cause, obviously, local
      arrangements will always be made by the peasantry. It cannot be
      otherwise in a democratic state; this is so obvious that there
      is no need even to talk about it. But in answer to the question
      of what must be done to secure the land for the working people,
      we say: “We want to protect the interests of the wage-workers
      and poor peasants.” Our Russian Social-Democratic Party of
      Bolsheviks regards this as its duty. We ask ourselves: If we say
      that the land will belong to the nation is that the same as
      saying the land will belong to the working people? Our answer
      is: No, it is not the same thing! By saying that the land will
      belong to the nation, we mean that landed property will be
      abolished; we mean that all the land will belong to the whole
      people; we mean that anyone who uses land will rent it from the
      nation. If such an arrangement is made no differences in land
      tenure will remain, all the land will be alike, and, as the
      peasants often say, “All the old bounds and barriers will fall
      away, the land will be unfenced—there will be free soil,
      and free labour.” 

Does that mean that the land will be handed over to all working
      people? No, it does not. Free labour on free soil means that all
      the old forms of land tenure will be abolished and there will be
      no other form of ownership than national ownership; everyone
      rents land from the state; there is a single state authority,
      that of all the workers and peasants; a peas ant can rent land
      from it as a leaseholder; between the peasant and the state
      there are no middlemen; the terms on which land is rented are
      equal for all; that is free labour on free soil.

Does that mean that the land will be handed over to all the
      working people? No, it does not. You cannot eat land, and to
      farm it you need implements, animals, equipment, and money;
      without money, without implements, you cannot farm. And so, when
      you set up a system of free labour on free soil, there will be
      no landed estates, no categories on

    

the
land.[4] There will be
      only land which is national property and free tenants renting
      land from the state. When you set up this system it will not
      mean the transfer of the land to all the working people, it will
      merely mean that every farmer will freely dispose of his land;
      anybody who wants land will be free to rent it from the
      state. That will be a big step forward compared with the Russia
      of the tsars and landowners, It will be a big step forward
      because Russia of the tsars and landowners was a country in
      which 70,000,000 dessiatines were given over to 30,000 Markovs,
      Romanovs and other such landowners; it will be a Russia in which
      there will be free labour on free soil. This has already been
      done in many places. Already now Russia is ahead of the Russia
      of the tsars and landowners, but this is not a transfer of land
      to the working people, it is the transfer of land to the farmer,
      because if the land belongs to the state, and those people take
      it who want to farm it, that is not enough; it is not enough to
      want to farm, the ability to farm is also needed, and even
      ability is not enough. Any farm labourer or day-labourer has
      that ability, but he does not have sufficient animals,
      implements, and capital, so that no matter how many decisions
      are taken, no matter how much we talk about it, we shall not
      establish free labour on free soil in that way. Even if we were
      to hang up notices about free soil in every volost
      administration, it would not improve matters as far as the
      working people are concerned, any more than the prisons in
      West-European republics would cease to be prisons because they
      had the words “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” inscribed on
      them. If the words “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” are
      written on a factory, as in America, the factory does not
      thereby cease to be a hell for the workers and a paradise for
      the capitalists.

And so we have to think of what to do further, how to ensure
      that there should not be merely free labour—that is a step
      forward, but it is still not a step towards protecting the
      interests of the working people; it is a step towards liberation
      from the landowner sharks, from exploitation by the landowners,
      liberation from the Markovs, from the police, etc., but it is
      not a step towards protecting the interests of the working
      people, because the poor, propertyless peasant cannot do
      anything with the land without



animals,

    

implements, and
      capital. That is why I am very sceptical about the two so-called
      norms or standards of land tenure, the labour standard and the
      subsistence standard. I know that arguments about these two
      norms and explanations of them are always to be met with in the
      Narodnik parties. I know that those parties hold the view that
      these two norms, these two standards, must be
      established—the labour standard is the largest amount of
      land a family can till; the subsistence standard is one just
      sufficient to feed the family, less would mean hunger. I have
      said that I am very sceptical about this question of standards
      or norms and I believe it is a bureaucrat’s plan that will not
      do any good; it can’t be put into practice even if it were
      decided upon here. That is the crux of the whole matter! That
      plan cannot relieve the position of the hired labourers and poor
      peasants to any appreciable extent, and even if you accept it,
      it will remain on paper so long as capitalism dominates. That
      plan does not help us find the true road for the transition from
      capitalism to socialism.

When people speak of these two norms, these two standards, they
      imagine that only two things exist—the land and the
      citizen, as if there had never been anything else in the
      world. If that were so, the plan would be a good one. But that
      is not so—there exists the power of capital, the power of
      money; without money there cannot be any farming on the freest
      land, no matter what “standards” of it you have, because as long
      as money remains wage-labour ’will remain. And this means that
      the rich peasants—and there are no less than a million
      families of them in Russia—are oppressing and exploiting
      hired labourers, and will continue to oppress them on the “free”
      soil. Those rich peasants constantly, not by way of exception
      but as a general rule, resort to the hiring of workers by the
      year, by the season and by the day, that is, they resort to the
      exploitation of the poor peasants, the proletarians. Alongside
      this you have millions and millions of peasants who have no
      horses and cannot exist without selling their labour-power,
      without doing seasonal work for somebody else, etc. As long as
      the power of money, the power of capital, remains, no matter
      what “standards” of land tenure you establish they will at best
      be useless in practice because they do not take into
      consideration the chief factor—that

    

property in Implements,
      animals, and money is distributed unevenly; they do not take
      into consideration the existence of the hired labour that is
      exploited. That is a basic fact in the present-day life of
      Russia, and there is no getting away from it; but if we
      establish any kind of “standards”, life will bypass them and
      they will remain on paper. To protect the interests of the
      propertyless, poor peasants in this great transformation of
      Russia in which you are now engaged and which you will
      undoubtedly carry through, when private property in land will be
      abolished and a step forward will have been made towards the
      better, socialist future; to protect the interests of the
      workers and poor peasants in this great work of transformation
      that you are only just beginning, which will go a long way
      forward and which, it may be said without exaggeration, will
      undoubtedly be brought to completion in Russia because there is
      no power that can stop it, we must not take the road of
      establishing norms or standards, but must find some other
      way.

I and my Party comrades, in whose name I have the honour to
      speak, know of only two ways of protecting the interests of
      agricultural labourers and poor peasants, and we recommend these
      two ways to the Peasants’ Soviet for its attention.

The first way is to organise the agricultural labourers and poor
      peasants. We should like, and we advise it, to have in each
      peasant committee, in each volost, uyezd and gubernia, a
      separate group of agricultural labourers and poor peasants who
      will have to ask themselves: “If the land becomes the property
      of the whole people tomorrow—and it certainly will, because
      the people want it to—then where do we come in? Where shall
      we, who have no animals or implements, got them from? How are we
      to farm the land? How must we protect our interests? How are we
      to make sure that the land, which will belong to the whole
      people, which will really be the property of the nation, should
      not fall only into the hands of proprietors?
      If it falls into the hands of those who own enough animals and
      implements, shall we gain anything by it? Is that what we made
      this great revolution for? Is that what we wanted?” 

The “people” will have the land, but that is not enough
      to protect the interests of agricultural labourers. It is not

    

a
      matter of us here, from above, or the peasant committee,
      establishing a “standard” of land to be held by
      individuals. Such measures will not help as long as capital is
      dominant, and they will not offer deliverance from the
      domination of capitalism. There is only one way to escape the
      yoke of capitalism and ensure that the people’s land goes to the
      working people, and that is by organising the
      agricultural labourers, who will be guided by their experience,
      their observations and their distrust of what the village sharks
      tell them, even though these sharks wear red rosettes in their
      buttonholes and call themselves “revolutionary democrats”. 

The poor peasants can only be taught by independent organisation
      in the localities, they can only learn from their own
      experience. That experience will not be easy, we cannot and do
      not promise them a land flowing with milk and honey. The
      landowners will be thrown out because the people wish it, but
      capitalism will remain. It is much more difficult to do
      away with capitalism, and the road to its overthrow is a
      different one. It is the road of independent, separate
      organisation of the agricultural labourers and the poor
      peasants. And that is what our Party proposes in the first
      instance.

Only this road promises a gradual, difficult, but real and
      certain transfer of the land to the working people.

The second stop which our Party recommends is that every big
      economy, for example, every big landed estate, of which there
      are 30,000 in Russia, should be organised as soon as possible
      into a model farm for the common cultivation of the
      land jointly by agricultural labourers and scientifically
      trained agronomists, using the animals, implements, etc., of the
      landowner for that purpose. ’Without this common
      cultivation under the direction of the Soviets of Agricultural
      Labourers the land will not go entirely to the working
      people. To be sure, joint cultivation is a difficult
      business and it would be madness of course for anybody to
      imagine that joint cultivation of the land can be decreed from
      above and imposed on people, because the centuries-old habit of
      farming on one s own cannot suddenly disappear, and because
      money will be needed for it and adaptation to the new mode of
      life. If this advice, this view, on the common cultivation

of
      the land with commonly owned animals and implements to be used
      to the best purpose jointly with agronomists—if this advice
      were the invention of individual political parties, the case
      would be a bad one, because changes are not made in the life of
      a people on the advice of a party, because tens of millions of
      people do not make a revolution on the advice of a party, and
      such a change would be much more of a revolution than the
      overthrow of the weak-minded Nicholas Romanov. I repeat, tens of
      millions of people will not make a revolution to order, but will
      do so when driven to it by dire need, when their position is an
      impossible one, when the joint pressure and determination of
      tens of millions of people break down the old barriers and are
      actually capable of creating a new way of life. When we advise
      such a measure, and advise caution in the handling of it, saying
      that it is becoming necessary, we are not drawing that
      conclusion from our programme, from our socialist doctrine
      alone, but because we, as socialists, have come to this
      conclusion by studying the life of the West-European nations. We
      know that there have been many revolutions over there and that
      they have established democratic republics; we know that in
      America in 1865 the slave-owners were defeated and hundreds of
      millions of dessiatines of land were distributed among the
      peasantry for nothing or next to nothing, and nevertheless
      capitalism dominates there more than anywhere else and oppresses
      the mass of the working people as badly as, if not worse than,
      in other countries. This is the socialist teaching, this is our
      study of other nations that firmly convinces us that without the
      common cultivation of the land by agricultural labourers using
      the best machinery and guided by scientifically trained
      agronomists there is no escape from the yoke of capitalism. But
      if we were to be guided only by the experience of the
      West-European countries it would be very bad for Russia, because
      the Russian people in the mass are only capable of taking a
      serious step along that new path when the direst need
      arises. And we say to you: the time has now come when that dire
      need for the entire Russian people is knocking at the door. The
      dire need I speak of is precisely this—we cannot continue
      farming in the old way. If we continue as before on our small
      isolated farms, albeit as free citizens on free soil, we are
      still faced with imminent

    

ruin, for the debacle is drawing
      nearer day by day, hour by hour. Everyone is talking about it;
      it is a grim fact, due not to the malice of individuals but to
      the world war of conquest, to capitalism.

The war has exterminated millions of people, has drenched the
      world in blood, brought it to the brink of disaster. This is no
      exaggeration, nobody can vouch for what will happen tomorrow;
      everyone is talking about it. Take the newspaper
      Izvestia of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies—everybody there is saying that the capitalists are
      resorting to slow-down tactics and lockouts. That means there is
      no work and the capitalists are laying off large numbers of
      workers. That is what this criminal war has brought all
      countries to, and not Russia alone.

That is why we say that farming on individual plots, even if it
      is “free labour on free soil”, is no way out of the dreadful
      crisis, it offers no deliverance from the general ruin. A
      universal labour service is necessary, the greatest
      economy of manpower is necessary, an exceptionally strong and
      firm authority is necessary, an authority capable of effecting
      that universal labour service; it cannot be done by officials,
      it can be done only by the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and
      Peasants’ Deputies, because they are the people, they are the
      masses, because they are not a government of officials, because
      they, knowing the life of the peasant from top to bottom, can
      organise labour conscription, can organise that protection of
      human labour that would not permit the squandering of the
      peasant’s labour, and the transition to common cultivation
      would, under these circumstances, be carried out gradually and
      with circumspection. It is a difficult business, but ii; is
      necessary to go over to common cultivation on big model farms;
      if that is not done it will be impossible for Russia to find a
      way out of the debacle, out of the truly desperate situation in
      which she finds herself, and it would be the greatest mistake to
      think that such a gigantic transformation in the life of the
      people can be made at a single stroke. That cannot be done, it
      requires the greatest labour effort, it requires concentration,
      determination and energy on the part of each peasant and worker
      at his own place, at his own particular job, which he knows and
      has been working at for years. It is not a thing that can

    

be
      done by any sort of decree, but it is a thing that must be done,
      because this war of conquest has brought all mankind to the
      brink of destruction; tens of millions of lives have been lost,
      and still more will be lost in this terrible war unless we
      strain our efforts, unless all organisations of the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies take joint and determined action
      towards the common cultivation of the soil without the
      capitalists and without the landowners. That path is the only
      one that will lead to the real transfer of the land to the
      working people.

The peasants in Russia, as a class of feudal society, were
      divided into three major categories:


      (1) privately-owned (landowners’) peasants,

      
      (2) state peasants, and

      
      (3) crown-land peasants (belonging to the tsar’s family).
    

Each of these categories, in turn, was split up into different
      levels and special groups, based on race, heritage, forms of
      holdings and tenure, legal and agrarian status, etc. The Peasant
      Reform of 1861, carried out by the tsarist government, kept this
      diversity of social-status intact right up to the October
      Revolution of 1917.

The lists of candidates for members of the district councils
      have been published (in a free supplement to
      Vedomosti
      Obshehestvennovo Gradonachalstva for
May 17).[2] Unfortunately,
      information is given only for ten districts. Nevertheless, we
      have a very clear and striking picture of party
      alignments, a picture that deserves close study on account
      of its electioneering value and the light it throws on the
      class ties of the different parties.


Partisanship, as we know, is both a condition for and index of
      political development. The more politically developed and
      enlightened the given population or given class is, the higher,
      as a general rule, is its party organisation. This rule is borne
      out by the experience of all civilised countries. From the point
      of view of the class struggle that is obviously how it should
      be. Non-partisanship or insufficient party crystallisation and
      party organisation implies at best class instability (at worst,
      this deficiency signifies deception of the masses by political
      charlatans a thing that is only too well known in parliamentary
      countries).


What, then, do the published lists of candidates in Petrograd
      reveal to us in the matter of party alignments?


Altogether 71 lists have been put forward in 10 districts. The
      first thing we notice is that they fall into five major
      groups.






      1. The R.S.D.L.P.—the Bolsheviks. Lists have been
      put forward in all 10 districts. Our Party has formed a bloc
      with two other groups—the Inter-District group and the
      internationalist Mensheviks. This bloc is strictly based on
      principles and is openly proclaimed in resolutions passed by
      our

    


    


    

Party’s Petrograd and All-Russia
      conferences.[1]

The
      fundamental issue in contemporary political life both in
      Russia and the rest of the world is that of the struggle of
      proletarian internationalism against the chauvinism (or
      “defencism”) of the big and petty bourgeoisie. Our Party has
      publicly declared its determination to work for closer
      relations and unity among all internationalists (see the

      resolution of the All-Russia
Conference on uniting the internationalists against the
petty-bourgeois defencist bloc).


The party of the proletariat has taken a clear, open and honest
      stand on the issues involved in the elections.


      2. A no less clear class physiognomy is shown by the party of
         “people’s freedom”, namely, the Cadets, actually the party of
         the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. They, too, have put
         forward 10 party lists in all 10 districts. As we know,
         all the parties of the landowners and capitalists
         are now supporting the Cadets, but for the time
         being they do so on the quiet.


      3. Third as regards clearly defined party alignment comes the
         new-fledged Radical-Democratic Party, which has put forward
         its lists in only 6 out of the 10 districts. This unknown
         party is obviously another capitalist party which hopes to
         “pull” the votes of the men in the street by non-committal
         promises—something in the nature of Cadets in disguise.


      4. Fourth comes a group that has put up 17 lists in 9
         districts—a motley assortment of Narodniks (Trudoviks,
         Socialist-Revolutionaries, and Popular Socialists) and
         Mensheviks with the addition of the notorious Yedinstvo
         group in varied
combinations.[3]


A regular petty-bourgeois hodge-podge and petty-bourgeois lack
      of principles! Not one of these groups and parties has
      dared to come out in advance with an open statement of
      principles in support of their decision to work for closer
      relations and unity. They have been swept along by events, and
      are trailing after the chauvinists. They have all fallen into
      the same mire and are floundering in it like the true
      philistines they are. They are trying to worm themselves into
      each district in every way they can. If it can’t be done by hook
      it will have to be done by crook—that is their motto.

 

If they are all of one mind on defencism or on supporting the
      coalition cabinet, then why don’t they join forces to fight the
      elections in a united, open, political bloc recognising a set of
      definite principles?


The whole trouble is that the petty bourgeoisie, that is to say,
      the Narodniks and Mensheviks, lack principles and the spirit of
      party. They are all defencists and ministerialists. Yet they do
      not trust one another. In one district the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries run independently, in another they
      make common cause with the Popular Socialists and the Trudoviks
      (with people who approve of compensation for the landowners!
      With parties whom the S.R.s Vikhlayev, Chernov and Co. in
      1906–07 openly accused of worshipping at the shrine of
      poprietary instincts!). More often than not they make
      common cause with the Mensheviks, sometimes with
      Yedinstvo, that very same Yedinstvo of which
      Dyelo Naroda writes in either a hostile or contemptuous
      tone.


Never mind! The man in the street will swallow anything! The
      petty bourgeois does not bother his head about partyism or
      principles. In the newspaper “we” are against
      Yedinstvo, but in order to get into the District
      Councils “we” are for it....


Exactly like the Mensheviks. They too, in their paper, are
      against Yedinstvo, and at their All-Russia
conference[4] they greeted the notorious Deutsch with shouts of
      disapproval—a fact of which Yedinstvo complained
      openly. Never mind, the man in the street has a short memory. We
      shall act in the man-in-the-street way! “In principle” we are
      against the Deutsches and the Jordanskys, we are ashamed of them
      in front of the workers, but when it comes to getting a
      political berth for ourselves we don’t mind running with these
      gentlemen on the same tickets!


Let all the class-conscious workers know, and let them spread
      the news about it among the working-class masses, that the bloc
      of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and all the Narodniks with the
      Mensheviks is a bloc of people who are trying to sneak in the
      Yedinstvo heroes, a bloc of people who are ashamed
      of their allies. 


In two districts, Kazansky and Spassky, there are 110 Mensheviks
      or S.R.s at all. Apparently they have concealed their
      identity in the lists of the District Soviets, i.e., in the

    

lists of non-party candidates (in each district the
      number of candidates is incomplete—38 and 28 respectively
      against 54 and 44 of the Cadet Party and 43 and 46 of our
      Party). In two districts, therefore, the petty-bourgeois parties
      found even their motley semi-partyism too much for them, and
      landed for good and all in the mire of non-partyism—“who
      cares for parties, the thing is to get elected!” That, always
      and everywhere, has been the motto of bourgeois
      parliamentarians.

5. In the fifth group non-partisanship reigns
    supreme. They have 28 lists in 10 districts, and most of these
    groups exist in one district only. This is philistinism at its
    local narrowest. And what a mixed crowd they are! We have here a
    “House Management”, a “Group of Employees in Educational
    Institutions”, an “Honesty, Accountancy, and Fairness Group”
    (believe it or not...) and a group of “Democratic Republicans and
    Socialist Functionaries Nominated by  Non-Party Toilers,
    Republican Democrats, Working in the House Committees”....


Comrade workers! Let us all get down to work, canvassing all the
      poorest homes, awakening and enlightening the domestic servants,
      the most backward workers, etc., etc. Let us campaign against
      the capitalists and the Cadets, disguised as “Radical
      Democrats”, who hide behind the Cadets’ backs. Let us campaign
      against the petty-bourgeois defencist mire of the Narodniks and
      Mensheviks, against their bloc, which stands for no parties and
      no principles, against their attempts to sneak into their joint
      lists the Trudoviks, the advocates of compensation, and the
      heroes of Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo with whom even such
      ministerial papers as Dyelo Naroda and Rabochaya
      Gazeta are ashamed to be seen in the same company!

In criticising other parties we should not forget to criticise
      ourselves. The published lists of candidates for members of the
      Petrograd District Councils have revealed two short comings in
      our Party organisation and Party work.


The first shortcoming is this. Our list for Liteiny District has
      only 33 candidates as against the 63 of the Cadets and the
      Menshevik bloc with Yedinstvo and the
      Narodniks. Apparently, our Party workers have not been able to
      find more than 33 candidates of the proletarian party in this
      wealthy district. But this is an obvious shortcoming in our
      work, an obvious indication that we have not gone down far
      enough into the midst of the working and exploited people. We
      must break with established custom. In the wealthy districts we
      must “go among the people” more energetically than ever, and
      waken more and more strata of the working and exploited people
      to political consciousness. We should get the non-party
      proletarian elements—especially the domestic
      servants for instance—to take an active part in the
      elections and not hesitate to put the most reliable of them into
      our proletarian list. Why should we fear a minority of non-party
      proletarian elements, when the majority are
      class-conscious internationalist
proletarians?...[1]

      [This document refers to the decisions of the Seventh
      (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks)
      held in Petrograd on April 24–29 (May 7-12), 1917.]



      1. The complete disruption of Russia’s economic life has now
         reached a point where catastrophe is unavoidable, a
         catastrophe of such appalling dimensions that a number of
         essential industries will be brought to a standstill, the
         farmer will be prevented from conducting farming on the
         necessary scale, and railway traffic will be interrupted with
         a consequent stoppage of grain deliveries to the industrial
         population and the cities, involving millions of people. What
         is more, the break-down has already started, and has affected
         various industries. Only by the greatest exertion of all the
         nation’s forces and the adoption of a number of immediate
         revolutionary measures, both in the local areas and at the
         centre of government, can this debacle be effectively coped
         with.


      2. Neither by bureaucratic methods, i.e., the setting up of
         institutions in which the capitalists and officials
         preponderate, nor by preserving the profits of the
         capitalists, their supreme rule in industry, their supremacy
         over finance capital, and their commercial secrets as regards
         their banking, commercial, and industrial transactions, can
         the disaster be averted. This has been amply proved by the
         partial effects of the crisis as revealed in a number of
         industries.


      3. The only way to avert disaster is to establish effectual
         workers’ control over the production and distribution of
         goods. For the purpose of such control it is necessary, first
         of all, that the workers should have a majority of not less
         than three-fourths of all the votes in all the decisive
         institutions and that the owners who have not withdrawn from
         their business and the engineering staffs should be enlisted

    

without fail; secondly, that shop committees, the central and
         local Soviets, as well as the trade unions, should have the
         right to participate in this control, that all commercial and
         bank books be open to their inspection, and that the
         management supply them with all the necessary information;
         third, that a similar right should be granted to
         representatives of all the major democratic and socialist
         parties.


      4. Workers’ control, which the capitalists in a number of
         conflict cases have already accepted, should, by means of
         various well-considered measures introduced gradually but
         without any delay, be developed into full regulation of the
         production and distribution of goods by the workers.


      5. Workers’ control should similarly be extended to all
         financial and banking operations with the aim of discovering
         the true financial state of affairs; such control to be
         participated in by councils and conventions of bank,
         syndicate and other employees, which are to be organised
         forthwith.


      6. To save the country from disaster the workers and peasants
         must first of all be inspired with absolute and positive
         assurance, conveyed by deeds and not by words, that the
         governing bodies both in the local areas and at the centre
         will not hesitate to hand over to the people the bulk of the
         profits, incomes, and property of the great banking,
         financial, commercial, and industrial magnates of capitalist
         economy. Unless this measure is carried out, it is futile to
         demand or expect real revolutionary measures or any real
         revolutionary effort on the part of the workers and peasants.


      7. In view of the break-down of the whole financial and monetary
         system and the impossibility of rehabilitating it while the
         war is on, the aim of the state organisation should be to
         organise on a broad, regional, and subsequently country-wide,
         scale the exchange of agricultural implements, clothes, boots
         and other goods for grain and other farm products. The
         services of the town and rural co-operative societies should
         be widely enlisted.


      8. Only when these measures have been carried out will it be
         possible and necessary to introduce general and compulsory
         labour service. This measure, in turn, calls for the
         establishment of a workers’ militia, in which the workers are
         to serve without pay after their regular eight-hour day; this
         to be followed, by the introduction of a nation-wide people’s

    

militia in which the workers and other employees shall be
         paid by the capitalists. Only such a workers’ militia and the
         people’s militia that will grow out of it could and should
         introduce universal compulsory labour service, not by
         bureaucratic means and in the interests of the capitalists,
         but to save the country from the impending debacle. Only such
         a militia could and should introduce real revolutionary
         discipline and get the whole people to make that supreme
         effort necessary for averting disaster. Only universal
         compulsory labour service is capable of ensuring the maximum
         economy in the expenditure of labour-power.


      9. Among the measures aimed at saving the country from disaster,
         one of the most important tasks is that of engaging a large
         labour force in the production of coal and raw materials, and
         for work in the transport services. No less important is it
         that the workers employed in producing ammunition should be
         gradually switched over to producing goods necessary for the
         country’s economic rehabilitation.


      10. The systematic and effective implementation of all these
          measures is possible only if all the power in the state
          passes to the proletarians and semi-proletarians.

Everyone is thinking and talking about how to end the war.


Practically all the workers and peasants are agreed that the war
      was started by the capitalists and that it is the capitalists of
      all countries who need it. And that is what the
      resolutions of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and
      Peasants’ Deputies say.


This is the undoubted truth.


Opinion differs when we come to the question of what
      way to end the war (everyone realises that it
      cannot be ended abruptly). Are we to go about it by way
      of a deal with the capitalists, and if so, what kind of deal? Or
      are we to go by way of a workers’ revolution, i.e., by
      overthrowing the capitalists? That is the basic, cardinal issue.


On this question our Party disagrees with the Petrograd Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and with the All-Russia
      Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, both of which incline towards
      deciding this question in favour of the capitalists and
      through the capitalists.


This has been strikingly confirmed by the resolution on the war
      adopted by the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies. In
      keeping with the notorious—and no less muddled—appeal
      to the nations of the world (dated March 14), this resolution
      demands:



      “peace without annexations and indemnities, with the right of
      every nation, in whatever state boundaries It may be living, to
      decide its own destiny.”


 

The question of annexations is formulated differently here
      compared with the way it was recently put in Izvestia
      of the Petrograd Soviet and in Dyelo Naroda (see
      Pravda No. 60 for
May 18 [1]

)



The two latter newspapers, controlled by the Narodnik Menshevik
      bloc, are in a hopeless muddle when they declare that peace
      “without annexations” means returning to the state of things
      that existed before the war (the Latin phrase used for this is
      status quo ante bellum). 


Such a solution of the problem—let us not blink the
      truth—means making a deal with the capitalists and between
      the capitalists. It means: Let us keep the old annexations (made
      before the war), but let us have no new ones.


For one thing, no socialist who does not wish to betray
      socialism can accept such a solution. It is not a socialist’s
      job to make peace between the capitalists on the basis of the
      old division of spoils, that is, annexations. That is
      obvious. Secondly, such a solution, in any event, is
      impracticable unless there is a revolution against
      capital, at least against Anglo-Japanese capital, since no
      man in his right senses can doubt that without a
      revolution Japan will never give up Kiaochow, nor Britain
      Baghdad and her African colonies.


The peasant resolution gives a different definition to
      annexations. It proclaims the right of every nation
      (meaning also those annexed before the war) to be free
      and “to decide its own destiny”.


This is the only correct solution of the problem as far as any
      really consistent democrat, not to mention a socialist, is
      concerned. No true socialist can put the question of annexations
      in any other way or deny any nation the right to self-
      determination and secession.


Let us not deceive ourselves, however. Such a demand implies a
      revolution against the capitalists. And the first to turn down
      such a demand (unless there is a revolution) will be the British
      capitalists, who have more annexed territories than any other
      nation in the world.


Neither of these demands, these wishes, either that of
      renouncing annexations in the sense of restoring status quo,

    

or
      renouncing all annexations, both old and new, are realisable
      without a revolution against capital, without the overthrow of
      the capitalists. We must not deceive ourselves or the people on
      this score.


Either we advocate and look forward to a deal with the
      capitalists—and that would amount to inspiring the people
      with faith in their worst enemies—or we place our faith
      solely in the workers’ revolution and concentrate all our
      efforts on overthrowing the capitalists.


We must make our choice between these two ways
      of ending the war.

If an iron chain is needed to hold a weight, say, of 100 poods, what would
    happen if we replaced one of its links by a wooden one?
The chain would break.
No matter how strong and intact all the other links are, if the wooden
    link breaks the whole chain will burst.
The same is true in politics.
The Mensheviks and Narodniks, the ministerialist gentlemen of these
    petty-bourgeois parties, have joined forces with Plekhanov’s
    “Yedinstvo” in the elections to the District Councils.
You have only yourselves to blame, gentlemen!
Your “iron” chain was poor and rusty enough as it is, and now it has
    several links made not even of wood, but of clay and paper.
You have only yourselves to blame!
Comrades, working men and working women, soldiers, toilers, do you
    realise that by voting for the Narodnik-Menshevik bloc you will be
    voting for Plekhanov’s “Yedinstvo”?
You will be voting for that disgraceful Yedinstvo of
    Plekhanov’s which even the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary newspapers
    turn away from.
You will be voting for that disgraceful Yedinstvo of
    Plekhanov’s which, to the capitalists’ delight, frankly advocates war
    to a victorious finish.
You will be voting for that disgraceful Yedinstvo of
    Plekhanov’s which daily whitewashes the Russian capitalists by throwing all
    the blame on the German capitalists and tramples on the fraternal alliance
    of the workers of all
    

countries in their struggle against the
    capitalists of all countries.
If you stand for the working people against the capitalists, if you wish
    to fight for bread, peace and liberty—then do not give a single
    vote to the bloc of the Narodniks and Mensheviks, who are trying to
    hide the rotten “Yedinstvo” in their lists!
Vote only for the Bolshevik and internationalist Social Democrats!

V. Bazarov, admittedly an authority on the condition of our
      industries, wrote in Novaya Zhizn for May 24:



      “The war and the resulting economic and financial break-down
      have created a state of affairs in which the private interest of
      private enterprise tends not towards strengthening and
      developing the productive forces of the country. but towards
      destroying them It is much more profitable at the present
      moment—in expectation of higher prices—to keep all
      the material elements of capital inactive than to put them into
      circulation; it is more profitable to produce, on terms ruinous
      to the country, absolutely useless military supplies than to
      serve conscientiously the pressing needs of the people; and it
      is most profitable of all to build new munition factories which
      will never be utilised, and which would not be in a position to
      start work until two or three years hence. Is it any wonder that
      our so-called ‘national economy’ has degenerated into an orgy of
      wanton pillage, into industrial anarchy, into a systematic
      spoliation of the national wealth?... Why should an ignorant,
      and, for that matter, even a fully class-conscious worker,
      forego an ‘excessive’ increase in wages amounting to three or
      four rubles, when lie sees hundreds of millions of rubles looted
      and squandered before his very eyes?”



No honest person can deny that V. Bazarov is speaking the exact
      truth.


An “orgy of pillage”—no other words can describe
      the behaviour of the capitalists during the war.


This orgy is leading to national disaster.


We cannot keep silent. We cannot put up with it.


Every worker who knows and understands what is going on at “his”
      factory, every office employee working in a bank, factory or
      commercial house, who cannot remain indifferent to his country’s
      ruin, every engineer, statistician, accountant—all should
      do everything in their power to collect accurate, even
      fragmentary, and, if possible, documented

    

data concerning this
      orgy of pillage, i.e., concerning prices and profits.


We must not keep silent. We must not put up with it. After all,
      we are not children to let ourselves be lulled by promises made
      by near-socialist ministers or by commissions, departments, or
      sub-departments of government officials.


If the Russian Government were not a captive of the capitalists,
      if it were made up of people who could and would act decisively,
      act to save their country from ruin, it would immediately,
      without a day’s, without an hour’s delay, issue a decree
      ordering the publication of all prices charged on war
      contracts, of all data pertaining to profits.


To chatter about the impending debacle arid about saving the
      country from ruin without doing this, means descending
      to the level of deceivers of the people, or of playthings in the
      hands of tricksters.


To expect a government of capitalists, of Lvov, Tereshchenko,
      Shingaryov and Co., and their impotent, toylike “appendage” in
      the persons of Chernov, Tsereteli, Peshekhonov and Skohelev, to
      issue such a decree, and thus expose the capitalists,, would be
      childish and naive, Only those suffering from “ministerialist
      softening of the brain” are likely to expect that.


All the more energetically therefore must we encourage private
      initiative. Comrades and citizens! All those who really wish to
      save the country from famine must immediately collect and
      publish all accessible data pertaining to prices and
      profits. 


Exposing the capitalists is the first step towards curbing the
      capitalists.


Exposing the orgy of pillage is the first step in our fight
      against the pillagers.

The basic and cardinal issue of today Is that of the impending
      catastrophe. We must collect the most accurate possible data on
      it. Here are some very informative quotations from the paper of
      our opponents, the united Narodniks and Mensheviks
      (Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet No. 70, May 19):



      “The calamity of mass unemployment is drawing nearer. Resistance
      to the workers’ demands on the part of the united employers is
      growing. The employers are resorting to slow-down tactics in
      production and to lockouts.”



And further:



      “The capitalists are doing nothing to help the country out of
      Its economic difficulties....


      “The real disorganisers and counter-revolutionaries are the
      capitalists, who are hanging on to their profits. But the
      revolution will not and should not be allowed to go under. If
      the capitalists do nothing to help it voluntarily, the
      revolution must lay hands on them.”



This could hardly be expressed more eloquently. The situation
      must be critical indeed. “The revolution must lay hands on the
      capitalists.” But what revolution? The revolution of
      which class? How should it lay hands on them?


Here are answers given by speakers who reported to the Executive
      Committee of the Soviet on May 16:



      “A number of speakers revealed a depressing picture of
      widespread economic disorganisation in the country ... the
      bourgeois press says nothing about the real causes of the
      trouble, i.e., the war and the selfish conduct of the
      bourgeoisie.”


 

From the report of the Menshevik ministerialist Cherevanin:



      ’The present economic debacle is too grave to be cured by one or
      another palliative, by a number of separate concrete
      measures. What we need is a general plan, regulation of our
      whole economic life by the state....


      “To carry out this plan a special Economic Council must be set
      up under the Ministry.”



The mountain has brought forth a mouse. Instead of “the
      revolution laying hands on the capitalists” we are offered a
      purely bureaucratic remedy.


From the report of Avilov:



      “The main cause of the present economic break-down is the short
      age of the most essential industrial products....


      “Owing to the rising cost of living the position of the workers
      of numerous grades verges on chronic starvation....


      “Although they are making enormous profits, the employers re
      fuse to meet the workers unless there is a simultaneous rise in
      the prices of their goods....


      “The only way out of the present situation is price fixing. But
      this can only be carried out if there is public control of
      distribution.


      “Given compulsory distribution of commodities at controlled
      prices, there must also be established control of production,
      which otherwise may sag or even be suspended...


      “At the same time the state must institute control over the
      sources from which industry receives its circulating and fixed
      assets—the banking houses.”



What Comrade Avilov seems to have forgotten is that the “state”
      is a machine which the working class and the capitalists are
      pulling different ways. Which class is now capable of wielding
      state power?


From Bazarov’s report:



      “Fixed prices are virtually evaded; the state monopolies exist
      only on paper; controlled supply of the factories with coal and
      metal has not only failed to organise production in the
      interests of the state, but has not even been able to cope with
      the market anarchy or eliminate the unrestrained speculation of
      the middlemen and dealers.


      “What is needed is compulsory state trustification of industry.


      “Only by drafting the managements of the various enterprises and
      the capitalists into compulsory state service can really
      effective measures be taken to combat the anarchy which the
      industrialists are deliberately creating in production.”


 

To say that the government of the capitalists (who are
      deliberately creating anarchy) must draft the capitalists into
      compulsory state service is tantamount to forgetting the class
      struggle.


From the report by G. V. Shuba:



      “Despite the ceaseless demands we have been making for the last
      two months, not an inch of progress has been made in the general
      question—the problem of organising the national economy and
      labour. The result is that we have been simply marking time. At
      present the situation is this: although we have succeeded, in
      the face of opposition, in getting a number of measures and laws
      passed—we already have a grain monopoly law—all this
      remains on paper....


      “We have reached an agreement in principle on the
      municipalisation of agricultural machines, but we can do nothing
      about it because there are practically no machines. to speak
      of. The factories built to produce agricultural machines are
      turning out absolutely unessential articles for the army. Apart
      from the fact that the whole economic life of the country must
      be subject to regulation, we must at last break up and remodel
      the whole executive machinery of government.’



This is more to the point, closer to the heart of the matter!
      “Break up and remodel the whole executive machinery of
      government”—now that gets us down to bedrock. Obviously, the
      question of government machinery is only a fraction of
      the larger question as to which class is wielding the state
      power.


From Kukovetsky’s report:



      “The country’s financial situation is appalling. We are heading
      rapidly for financial bankruptcy....


      “Purely financial measures will do no good....


      “Measures must be taken towards compulsory distribution of the
      government loan, and if this does not yield the desired results,
      we must introduce a compulsory loan.


      “The second measure is the compulsory regulation of industry and
      the establishment of fixed prices on goods.”



      “Compulsory” measures are a good thing, but the question
      is—which class will be the compellers and which the
      compelled?


From the report of Groman:



      “What is happening in all countries today may be described as a
      process of disintegration of the national economic organism. It
      is being countered everywhere by the organising principle. The
      state has every. Where begun to organise the economy and
      labour....

 

      “So far neither the government nor the country at large has a
      central organ which could regulate the country’s economic life,
      There is no economic brain, as it were It must be created.... An
      authoritative executive body must be organised. An Economic
      Council must be set up.”



A new bureaucratic institution—that is what Groman’s idea
      amounts to! Very sad.


They all admit that an unheard-of catastrophe is inevitable. But
      they do not understand the main thing—that only the
      revolutionary class can save the country.

The expression “sleight of hand” has been taken from the
      editorial in today’s Dyelo Naroda. This newspaper of
      the “Socialist-Revolutionaries”, to which Kerensky and Chernov
      are contributors, exposes the tricks of the French
      spokesmen of “tamed socialism”, saying:



      “These are old tricks, a very old sleight of hand. which in
      our country
have been repeatedly and unsuccessfully practised by
      Mr. Plekhanov without deceiving anybody....”



Are you sure they were practised only by Plekhanov, my dear
      sirs?


Are you not going to the elections in a bloc with this
      very Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo? Are you not helping it
      to get in, are you not saving it?


It was in your paper (No. 44 for May 9) that S. Mstislavsky
      wrote of Plekhanov:



      “When a recent leader of Russian Social-Democracy lends his band
      to such counter-revolutionary attacks [as those of Russkaya
      Volya and Novoye Vremya], then it is with,
      profound regret and sincere sorrow that we are compelled to
      recognise this fact, since we never really imagined that the
      degeneration of the International had gone so far.”



We would add: and the degeneration of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries who have joined forces with this
      very “Yedinstvo”.


And in an unsigned, i.e., editorial, note in Dyelo
      Naroda No. 48, for May 13, we read:



      “‘Yedimistvo’s’ political unity with the liberal
      bourgeoisie is common knowledge.”



Mark that carefully! The “Socialist-Revolutionaries” and the
      Mensheviks are in unity with that very Yedinstvo
    

whose
      political unity with the liberal bourgeoisie is common
      knowledge. Do not forget this, comrades, men and women
      workers, and soldiers!


The Menshevik Rabochaya Gazeta for April 20 (No. 35)
      wrote in an editorial:



      “We are against the British imperialists. Yendinistvo
      is against the British socialists. Herein lies the whole
      difference. Herein lies the reason why Yedinstvo has to
      argue à la Hottentot....  The Russian workers remember only too
      well how Plekhanov, during the tsarist regime [there is a
      misprint in the text: it should read “during the tsarist
      republican regime”], tried in all manner of ways to dissuade
      them from going on strike. Then, too, Plekhanov tried to scare
      us with things even more terrible; ho tried to assure us that
      such conflicts only played into the hands of the German General
      Staff.”



And in the issue of the same paper for May 16 (No. 57) the
      discreetly moderate ministerialist Cherovanin wrote:



      “Plekhanov and his Yedinstvo are doing everything they
      possibly can here to compromise the principle of defencism,
      which has been compromised enough on an international scale
      thanks to the efforts of the majority of the German, French and
      other socialists.”



This is how Yedinstvo is estimated by the Narodniks and
      the Mensheviks, this is how they try to dissociate
      themselves from it, this is how ashamed they are of
      it!


Nevertheless they have entered into a bloc with it at the
      elections, and Plekhanov accepts seats from people who publicly
      call him names, such as “juggler”, “tamed socialist”,
      “Hottentot”, “compromised”, “in unity with the liberal
      bourgeoisie”.


Which member of that bloc is the worst?


Workers and soldiers! Not one vote to the bloc of the Narodniks
      and Mensheviks, who are shielding and working for
      Yedinstvo, which is “in unity with the liberal
      bourgeoisie”!

Who does not know the newspaper Novoye
      Vremya? Who does not know that in the course of many a
      decade this paper has “earned” for itself the name of defender
      of the tsarist regime, defender of the capitalists, Jew-baiter
      and hounder of revolutionaries?


Who does not know that all that was honest in Russia always
      turned away from Novoye Vremya with indignation and
      contempt? That this paper, even now, after the revolution, has
      not changed its ways by one iota?


And now we have the first elections in a free Russia. On the
      first day of the elections Novoye Vremya comes out with
      the call: “Put forward the list of the people’s freedom party”.


The fact speaks for itself: all the landowners and capitalists,
      all the dark forces, all those who are trying to restore the
      tsar, are for the Cadets.


And the Mensheviks and Narodniks have given six
      ministers as hostages to the Cadets’ ten.


The Mensheviks and Narodniks have allowed themselves to be taken
      in by empty promises, not one of which has been kept. Not a
      single step has been taken by the government to stop the
      war, to abandon
annexations[1]

and to curb the capitalists, who are
      making outrageous profits and heading the country for
      destruction.


The war is dragging on, a debacle is imminent, the capitalists
      are making fortunes, the Mensheviks and Narodniks

    

are talking
      and threatening, threatening and talking.... But all this falls
      on deaf ears—Vaska the Cat (the capitalist) listens but
      goes on
eating.[2]
1)


Workers and soldiers, all toiling people! Not a single
      vote to the Cadets, not a single vote to the Mensheviks and
      Narodniks!


Vote for the Bolsheviks!

Today is the second and principal day of the elections, The most
      importunate in offering themselves to the electorate, besides
      the Cadets, are the united Mensheviks and Narodniks.


What answer did they have to our accusation concerning their
      shameful bloc with Yedinstvo? Are they prepared to
      defend this bloc on grounds of principle?


They are not.


In reply to our suggestion that the bloc with Yedinstvo
      was a disgrace, Rabochaya Gazeta quotes the example
      of—whom would you think?—of the agent provocateur
      Malinovsky and of his being smuggled into the Duma by the secret
      police!


The dishonesty of such a “method” of controversy is dealt with
      elsewhere [in this edition] in a

      separate
paragraph.[1]

Here we are concerned
      with “Rabochaya Gazeta’s” logic rather than its
      dishonesty. Look what you do, gentlemen! You parry our reference
      to “your” Yedinstvo by a counter-reference to “our”
      agent provocateur Malinovsky! What is the inference? The
      inference is that you consider Yedinstvo on a par with
      an agent provocateur!


That is how the wise heads of Rabochaya Gazeta “defend”
      the bloc with Yedinstvo. Very clever of them, to be
      sure. When told that they have in free Russia
      such a disgraceful colleague as Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo,
      they answer: And the Bolsheviks, in tsarist
      Russia, had the agent provocateur Malinovsky! Isn’t
      this a gem of a defence?

 

Dyelo Naroda, too, has put its toot into it in regard
      to Yedinstvo. On May 27, the first day of the
      elections, this paper of Kerensky, Chernov and Co. carried a
      front-page appeal to vote for the lists in which “Yedinstvo”
      is smuggled in. 


And on the second page of the same issue of Dyelo
      Naroda we read a lengthy denunciation of the
      “social-patriot” Plekhanov and his Yedinstvo,
      containing, among others, the following “vitriolic remark”:



      “We will gladly inform our readers what other liberal- and
      social-imperialist—‘Rech’, ‘Russkaya Volya’
      and
      ‘Yedinsstvo’—think about the Italian annexation [of
      Albania].”



A gem, is it not?


The “Socialist-Revolutionaries” call on the people to vote for
      lists in which the candidates of Yedinstvo are
      concealed, the very same “Yedinstvo” which the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves, and on election day at
      that, call ’social imperialist”, i.e., socialist in word and
      ’imperialist in deed”, the very same Yedinstvo which
      they identify with Rech and Russkaya Volya.


The wise Rabochaya Gazeta, in a bloc with the wise
      Dyelo Naroda, has certainly “defended”
      Yedinstvo today.


And Plekhanov accepts alms from people who “accidentally”
      compare him with Malinovsky, or, on election day, openly declare
      him to be a “social-imperialist”.


Such is the exhibition which this disgraceful bloc of the
      Mensheviks plus Narodniks plus Yedinstvo is making of
      itself.


Workers and soldiers! All toiling people! Not a single vote to
      the Narodniks and Mensheviks, who are trying to drag in the
      “social-imperialists”!


Vote for the Bolsheviks!

Counter-Revolution Takes the Offensive
“JACOBINS WITHOUT THE PEOPLE”

The counter-revolution has mustered strength enough to assume
      the offensive. With the aid of the Narodnik and Menshevik
      ministers the capitalists are organising an assault on liberty.


The decision to disband the “45th, 46th, 47th and 52nd
      regiments” of the 12th and 13th divisions, the decision to
      “prosecute” the “instigators” (what an odd word! Are
      “instigators” more important than “perpetrators” in war?), and
      side by side with this, the news of the arrest of
      Ensign Krusser for a speech made at a meeting in
      Skuliany, and finally, the Provisional Government’s extremely
      insulting tone in regard to
Kronstadt[1] (for
      example, that orders “must
      be obeyed without question”—is that the way to talk to
      citizens who, so far, have not been accused of anything, not of
      a single act of disobedience?)—all this, taken
      together, and highlighted by that gloating defender of the
      counter-revolutionary capitalists, Rech (“the
      government at last has spoken up in the language of
      authority”)—all this clearly points to the fact that the
      counter-revolution is taking the offensive.


This “offensive” creates a strange impression. At the front the
      instigators, those guilty of “inciting to insubordination”, are
      arraigned before the court, and four regiments are “disbanded”
      (four out of the two divisions’ eight regiments mentioned in the
      telegram, although, according to the same telegram reported in
      Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet No. 76, only
      one regiment out of the eight “came out in full force”
      and another one “almost in full force”). If you gentlemen of the
      government inform the people that you are disbanding certain
      regiments, if you find this useful, if you allow a

    

telegram
      about it to go through, then why don’t you tell us, clearly and
      plainly, in at least a few lines, what the reasons for
      insubordination were on the part of those you are prosecuting?


One of two things, gentlemen: either you work in silence—you
      have a military censorship—and do not bother about
      informing the public, or bothering it with your reports; or, if
      you do decide to keep the public informed, then tell it what
      it’s all about, give it the why and the wherefore of the case,
      let it know whether the people you are prosecuting are guilty of
      insubordination on a particular or general point.


Vagueness is a bad thing.


In the case of Krusser’s arrest, everything is quite clear. To
      hustle a man off to prison for a speech he has made at a
      meeting is hardly reasonable. Does it not signify that you
      have simply lost your heads? Why, you Cadets and Rights who
      share the cabinet with the Narodniks and Mensheviks have ten if
      not a hundred times more newspaper circulation than your
      opponents! And with such superiority in chief propaganda
      weapons, you hustle a man off to prison for “a speech at a
      meeting”! Have you gone berserk with fear, gentlemen?


We are not opposed to the use of revolutionary force in the
      interests of the nation’s majority.


When Plekhanov the other day mentioned the Jacobins of 1793 and
      their forthright statement that “such-and-such persons
      are enemies of the people”, we thought in this connection:
      No party should draw the line at imitating the Jacobins
      of 1793 on this point cited by Plekhanov.


The trouble is that there are Jacobins and Jacobins. A witty
      French saying, which Plekhanov was fond of quoting twenty years
      ago, when he was still a socialist, pokes fun at the “Jacobins
      without the people” (jacobins moins le peuple). 


The historical greatness of the true Jacobins, the Jacobins of
      1793, is that they were “Jacobins with the people”,
      with the revolutionary majority of the nation, with the
      revolutionary advanced classes of their time.


They are ridiculous and pitiful, the “Jacobins without the
      people”, they who merely pose as Jacobins, who are
      afraid
    

to declare clearly, openly and for all to hear
      that the exploiters, the oppressors of the people, the servants
      of the monarchy in all countries, the defenders of the
      landowners in all countries, are enemies of the people.


You have studied history, Messrs. Milyukovs and
      Plekhanovs—can you deny that the great Jacobins of
      1793 were not afraid to denounce precisely the members of the
      reactionary exploiting minority of their time as
      enemies of the people? Precisely the members of the reactionary
      classes of their time?


You, the present government, its backers, Its defenders, its
      servants—can you say openly, clearly, and officially which
      classes you consider “enemies of the people” all
      over the world?



But how can you! You are Jacobins without the people. You are
      merely posing as Jacobins. You look more like ordinary
      representatives of ordinary landowner and capitalist reaction.



Workers and soldiers! All toiling people! The counter revolution
      of the landowners and capitalists is assuming the offensive. Not
      a single vote for a single government party, for
      any parties participating in the government!


Vote for the Bolsheviks!


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The reference is to two decrees of the Provisional Government
      published May 24 and 27 (June 6 and 9), 1917. The first stated
      that “the Provisional Government considers the situation in
      Kronstadt to be threatening and absolutely intolerable”. The
      second made it known “to all the citizens of Kronstadt that the
      orders of the Provisional Government are to be obeyed without
      question”.


The sailors, soldiers and workers



      of the military workshops in Kronstadt—a fortress
      protecting Petrograd from the sea and the chief rear base of the
      Baltic fleet—played a very important part in preparing the
      victory of the October armed uprising in Petrograd. The
      Kronstadt Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies followed the
      lead of the Bolsheviks from the very first day of its
      existence. This was due to the revolutionary traditions of
      Kronstadt (the mutinies of 1905 and 1906, the uprising on the
      battle-ship Gangut in 1915) and to the existence
      of a strong Bolshevik organisation there which carried on
      revolutionary work all through the war.


Owing to the conflict between the Kronstadt Soviet and the
      Commissar of the Provisional Government, Pepelyaev, a
      resolution moved by the non-party section of the Soviet and
      supported by the Bolsheviks was passed on May 17(30), 1917
      abolishing the office of Government Commissar and vesting all
      power in the Kronstadt Soviet. This resolution stated that the
      sole authority in the town of Kronstadt was the Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which, on affairs of state
      concern, entered into direct contact with the Petrograd Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.



The bourgeois, S.R. and Menshevik press raised a hue and cry against
      the men of
      Kronstadt and the Bolsheviks, declaring that Russia was on the
      verge of collapse and anarchy, that Kronstadt was seceding, and
      so on.


A delegation from the Petrograd Soviet (Chkheidze, Gotz and
      others) followed by one from the Provisional Government
      (Ministers Skobelev and Tsereteli) went out to settle the
      Kronstadt incident. The latter succeeded in getting a decision
      passed through the Kronstadt Soviet arranging a compromise
      settlement, under which the Commissar was to be elected by the
      Soviet and endorsed by the Provisional Government. In addition,
      a general political resolution was adopted in which the
      Kronstadt Soviet declared that it recognised the authority of
      the Provisional Government, but that this “recognition does not,
      of course, exclude criticism and the desire that revolutionary
      democracy should create a new organisation of central authority
      by vesting all power in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies.” The resolution also expressed the hope that the
      Bolsheviks would succeed in achieving this



by means of ideological influence. It ended with a
      strong protest against attempts to ascribe to the Kronstadt
      Bolsheviks “the intention of separating Kronstadt from the rest
      of Russia.”


Lenin considered the revolutionary action in Kronstadt to have been
      premature. The negotiations by the Bolshevik group of the
      Kronstadt Soviet to settle the conflict and the further work of
      the Kronstadt Party organisation were directed by Lenin.

The filthy torrent of lies and slander which the capitalist
      papers have spewed out against the Kronstadt comrades has
      revealed once more how dishonest these papers are. They have
      seized on a quite ordinary and unimportant incident and
      magnified it to the dimensions of a “state” affair, of
      “secession” from Russia and so on and so
forth.[1]


Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet No. 74 reports that
      the Kronstadt incident has been settled. As was to have been
      expected, Ministers Tsereteli and Skobelev easily came to an
      understanding with the Kronstadt people on the basis of a
      compromise resolution. Needless to say, we express our hope and
      confidence that this compromise resolution, provided
      both sides faithfully live up to it, will, for a
      sufficiently lengthy period of time, eliminate conflicts in the
      work of the revolution both in Kronstadt and the rest
      of Russia.


The Kronstadt incident is a matter of principle to us in two
      respects.


First, it has revealed a fact long ago observed by us and
      officially recognised in our Party’s resolution (on the
      Soviets), namely, that in the local areas the
      revolution has gone farther than it has in Petrograd. Succumbing
      to the current craze for the revolutionary phrase, the Narodniks
      and Mensheviks as well as the Cadets did not wish to or could
      not grasp the significance of this fact.


Secondly, the Kronstadt incident raised an important,
      fundamental issue of programmatic significance, which no honest
      democrat, to say nothing of a socialist, can afford to treat
      with indifference. It is the question of whether

    

the central
      authority has the right to endorse officials elected by
      the local population or not.


The Mensheviks, to whose party Ministers Tsereteli and Skobelev
      belong, still claim to be Marxists. Tsereteli and Skobelev got a
      resolution passed in favour of such endorsement. In doing so,
      did they stop to think of their duty as Marxists?


Should the reader find this question naive and pass a remark to
      the effect that the Mensheviks now have really become a
      petty-bourgeois, even defencist (i.e., chauvinist) party, and
      therefore it would be ludicrous even to talk about Marxism, we
      shall not argue the point. All we shall say is that Marxism
      always gives close attention to questions of democratism, and
      the name of democrats can hardly be denied to citizens Tsereteli
      and Skobelev.


Did they stop to think of their duty as democrats, of their
      “title” as democrats, when they passed the resolution
      authorising the Provisional Government to “endorse” officials
      elected by the Kronstadt population?


Obviously, they did not.


In support of this conclusion, we shall quote the opinion of a
      writer who, we hope, even in the eyes of Tsereteli and Skobelev,
      is considered something of a scientific and Marxian
      authority. That writer is Frederick Engels.


In criticising the draft programme of the German Social-Democrats
      (now known as the Erfurt Programme) Engels wrote in
      1891 that the German proletariat was in need of a single and
      united republic.


      “But not,” Engels added, “such a republic as the present French
      Republic, which is really an empire founded in 1798 but without
      an emperor. From 1792 to 1798 every French department, every
      commune enjoyed complete self-government after the American
      pattern. That is what we [the German Social-Democrats] should
      have too. How self-government can be organised and how a
      bureaucracy can be dispensed with has been demonstrated to us by
      America and the First French Republic, as well as by Australia,
      Canada and other British colonies even today. Such provincial
      and communal self-government is much freer than, for instance,
      Swiss federalism, where each canton is really independent of the
      confederation [i.e., the central government] but at the same
      time is

    

the supreme authority as far as the minor subdivisions
      of the canton are concerned—the Bezirk and the Commune. The
      cantonal governments appoint the Bezirkestatthalter and
      Prefects. This right of appointing local officers is entirely
      unknown in English-speaking countries, and in future we must
      politely abolish this right [i.e., appointment from above], just
      as we should the Prussian Landräthe and
Regierungräthe.”[2]


Such was Engels’s opinion on questions of democracy as applied
      to the right of appointing officers from above. To express these
      views with greater precision and accuracy, he proposed that the
      German Social-Democrats should insert in their programme the
      following demand:


      “Complete self-government in the communes, districts, and
      regions through officers elected by universal suffrage;
      abolition of all state-appointed local and regional
      authorities.”


The italicised words leave nothing to be desired in the way of
      clarity and definiteness.


Worthy citizens, Ministers Tsereteli and Skobelev! You are
      probably flattered to have your names mentioned in history
      books. But will it be flattering to have every Marxist—and
      every honest democrat—say that Ministers Tsereteli and
      Skobelev helped the Russian capitalists to build such a republic
      in Russia as would turn out to be not a republic at all, but
      a monarchy without a monarch? 


P.S. This article was written before the Kronstadt
      incident entered its last stage, as reported in today’s
      papers. The Kronstadt people have not broken the
      compromise agreement. Not a single fact remotely
      suggesting a breach of this agreement has been
      cited. Rech’s reference to newspaper articles is mere
      subterfuge, since you can only break an agreement by deeds and
      not by newspaper articles. The fact then remains, that Ministers
      Tsereteli, Skobelev and Co. have allowed themselves to be scared
      for the hundredth and thousandth time by the screams of the
      frightened bourgeoisie and have resorted to gross
      threats against the people of Kronstadt. Crude, absurd
      threats, that merely serve the counter-revolution.

[SOURCE? not a footnote on page 536] 


      A conflict had arisen between the Kronstadt Soviet (most of whom
      were anachists) and the Commissar of the Provisional Government
      (Pepelyaev), a resolution moved by the non-party section of the

      democracy should create a new organisation of central authority
      by vesting all power in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies.” The resolution also expressed the hope that the
      Bolsheviks would succeed in achieving this. It ended with a
      strong protest against attempts to ascribe to the Kronstadt
      Bolsheviks the intention of separating Kronstadt from the rest
      of Russia.


Lenin considered the revolutionary action in Kronstadt to have
      been premature. The negotiations by the Bolshevik group of the
      Kronstadt Soviet to settle the conflict and the further work of
      the Kronstadt Party organisation were directed by Lenin.

Rabochaya Gazeta, the organ of the Menshevik
      ministerialists, takes a shot



at us by recalling
      the fact that the secret police arrested the Bolshevik
      conciliator Rykov in 1911 in order to give the Bolsheviks of our
      Party “freedom” of action “on the eve of the elections to the
      Fourth Duma” (Rabochaya Gazeta rubs this in).


But what does this fact prove? It proves that the secret police
      were clearing the way to the Duma for Malinovsky, who turned out
      to be an agent provocateur. Naturally, the secret police looked
      after their undercover agents.


Is our Party to be blamed for this? It is not, no more than any
      honest man would think of blaming Chernov and Co. for
      mistakenly vindicating Azef, or blaming Yonov and Co. (member of
      the Bund and colleague of Rabochaya Gazeta) for
      exonerating the agent provocateur Zhitomirsky (“Otsov”) in 1910
      in the name of the united Central Committee, or blaming those
      Mensheviks who, in 1904, tried for a time to defend the agent
      provocateur Dobroskokov, or blaming those Cadets who also had
      agent provocateurs in their midst, whose names have now been
      made public.


All parties without exception have made mistakes in
      failing to detect agent provocateurs. This is a
      fact. Rabochaya Gazeta, which has entered into a bloc
      with Minister Chernov, chooses to ignore his old
      mistakes and mentions only those of its present opponents. Such
      a method is clearly dishonest, clearly unscrupulous. The blow
      which Rabochaya Gazeta aimed at us has fallen upon
      itself, for it will never dare to admit to the world that it is
      honest to keep silent about Azef while shouting about a similar
      agent provocateur, Malinovsky, for selfish factional motives.

1.
Speech Concerning an Organ

       of the Press for the Petrograd Committee

The desire of the Petrograd Committee to have a press organ of
      its own is something new as far as the Central Committee is
      concerned. It is difficult to understand how such a question
      could have arisen at a time when arrangements are being made for
      a printing-press of our own and an agreement is about to be
      reached with the Inter-District group for getting Comrade Trotsky
      to edit a popular organ.


In the West, in the capitals or big industrial centres, there is
      no division of the press into local and central organs. Such a
      division is wasteful and harmful. It is not advisable to have a
      Petrograd Committee organ apart from the Central
      Organ. Petrograd, as a separate locality, does not
      exist. Petrograd is the geographical, political and
      revolutionary centre of all Russia. The life of Petrograd is
      being followed by the whole of Russia. Every step of Petrograd’s
      is a guide line for the whole of Russia. In view of this the
      life of the Petrograd Committee cannot be treated as a local
      affair.


Why not accept the Central Committee’s suggestion that a Press
      Committee be formed? In the history of the press in the West,
      where such committees have existed, there have of course been
      occasional misunderstandings between the editorial board and the
      committee, but these were due entirely to disagreements on
      policy. What grounds are there for any disagreements on policy
      between the Petrograd Committee and the Central Committee?
      Whether we want it or not the organ of the Petrograd Committee
      will always be the leading organ of the Party.

 

The experience gained in establishing an organ of its own would
      quickly convince the Petrograd Committee that it is impossible
      to confine the paper to local affairs. The Central Committee
      does not deny the need for giving more space to the Petrograd
      branch in the newspapers. The Central Committee does not deny
      the need for a popular organ that would bring our slogans home
      to the masses. But the establishment of a popular newspaper is a
      difficult job that calls for considerable experience. That is
      why the Central Committee is enlisting the services of Comrade
      Trotsky, who has succeeded in establishing his own popular
      organ—Russkaya
Gazeta.[1]


In the history of the West the question of a popular organ has
      never been so acute as it is with us. The level of the masses
      there rose more evenly as a result of the cultural and
      educational work done by the Liberals. In countries like Bohemia
      there are such popular organs. The purpose of a popular organ is
      to elevate the reader to an understanding of the leading party
      organ. If we do not establish a popular organ other parties will
      win the masses and use them to speculate with. The popular organ
      should not be of a local type, but owing to postal difficulties
      it is bound primarily to serve the needs of Petrograd. In order
      that local needs be adequately served the Petrograd Committee
      should secure proper representation on the editorial board of
      the paper.


    


2.
Draft Resolutions Introduced

      At The Meeting Of The Petrograd Committee

     First Resolution
   

The Central Committee is to issue two newspapers in
      Petrograd—the Central Organ and a popular paper with a
      single editorial board. The Petrograd Committee is to receive a
      consultative voice on the editorial board of the Central Organ,
      and a vote in the popular organ. The Central Committee is to
      devote a definite number of columns in both papers to items of
      local interest.


     Second Resolution
   

The Petrograd Committee resolves to co-operate in both papers
      published by the Central Committee on the conditions proposed by
      the latter, and to make every effort to serve the needs of local
      activities more fully and widely and to work out in greater
      detail the general line of the Party. Having reason to fear that
      the Central Committee or the editorial board appointed by it may
      place too much trust in the internationalist comrades who have
      disagreed with Bolshevism in the past, that the Central
      Committee may cramp the freedom and independence of action of
      the local comrades, that the Central Committee may not give them
      the influence they are entitled to as leaders of local
      activities, the Petrograd Committee is to elect a committee to
      formulate precise guarantees of the rights of the Petrograd
      Committee in the local department of both papers.

The answers of the French and the British governments clearly
      demonstrate the soundness of our repeated assertions that
      neither the Russian, nor the French, nor the British, nor the
      German capitalist government can throw over the policy of
      annexations, and that all such promises are designed to deceive
      the
peoples.[1]


We are fighting to seize Alsace-Lorraine, we are fighting for
      victory, the French replied. Be good enough to comply with the
      treaty and fight for Russian and German Poland, the British
      replied.


The bitter truth that capitalism cannot be reconciled to a
      non-annexationist policy has been exposed once more. The policy
      of the “conciliators”, of those who wish to reconcile the
      capitalists and the proletariat, the policy of the Narodnik and
      Menshevik ministerialists, is an obvious failure. All their
      hopes on a coalition government have been shattered, all their
      promises have been exposed as mere verbiage.


And most harmful of all, as far as the cause of the revolution
      and the interests of the toiling masses are concerned, is the
      attempt to cover up the whole thing with phrases. Two shadings
      stand out in this torrent of phrases, one as bad as the other.


Rabochaya Gazeta, the organ of the Menshevik
      ministerialists, brings grist to the Cadet mill. On the one
      hand, it says: “On this basis [on the basis of the answers of
      the two Allied powers] there can be no agreement between them
      and us....” When they say “us”, do they mean the Russian
      capitalists? The theory of the class struggle is thrown
      overboard; it is much more profitable to spout phrases about
      “democracy” In the abstract, while trampling underfoot the
      elementary

    

truth of Marxism, namely, that it is precisely
      within a “democracy” that the gulf between the
      capitalists and the proletarians is widest.


On the other hand, Rabochaya Gazeta wishes to make “an
      attempt at revision [of the agreements and the treaties]
      through a conference of representatives of the Allied
      governments to be specially convened”. The same old story:
      agreement with the capitalists, which, in fact, signifies
      deception of the workers by playing at negotiations
      with their class foes.


      “The pressure of the rank and file of the French and British
      democracies, even pressure by the French and British proletariat
      alone upon their respective governments...” writes Rabochaya
      Gazeta. In Russia the Mensheviks are supporting their
      own imperialist government, but in other countries they
      want pressure to be brought to bear.... What is this,
      if not sheer phrase-mongering and humbug from beginning to end?


      “We are working for it [for world peace] by convening an
      international socialist conference” ... to be attended by
      ministers from among those ex-socialists who have sided with
      their governments! This is “working” with a vengeance
      to deceive the people on a major scale by means of a series of
      minor deceptions.


We have Dyelo Naroda phrase-mongering “à la
      Jacobin”. That stern tone, those spectacular revolutionary
      exclamations: “we know enough” ... “faith in the victory of our
      Revolution” (with a capital letter, of course), “upon this or
      that step ... of the Russian revolutionary democracy depend the
      destinies ... of the entire Uprising [with a capital
      letter, of course] which the working people have so happily and
      so victoriously begun.”


Obviously, if you write the words Revolution and Uprising with
      capital letters it makes the thing look “awfully” frightening,
      just like the Jacobins. Plenty of effect at small expense. For
      the people who write this are virtually helping to crush the
      revolution and impede the uprising of the working people by
      supporting the Russian government of the imperialists,
      by supporting their methods of concealing from the
      people the secret treaties, their tactics of putting
      off the immediate abolition of the landed estates, by supporting
      their war

    

policy of “offensive”, their high-handed insulting
      behaviour towards the local representative bodies,
      their presumption to appoint or endorse the local
      officers elected by the local population, and so on ad
      infinitum.


Gentlemen, heroes of the phrase, knights of revolutionary
      bombast! Socialism demands that we distinguish between
      capitalist democracy and proletarian democracy, between
      bourgeois revolution and proletarian revolution, between a
      rising of the rich against the tsar and a rising of the working
      people against the rich. Socialism demands that we
      distinguish our bourgeois revolution, which has ended (the
      bourgeoisie now is counter-revolutionary),from the mounting
      revolution of the proletarians and poor peasants. The former
      revolution is for war, for preserving the
      landed estates, for “subordinating” the local organs of
      self-government to the central government, for secret
      treaties. The latter revolution has begun to throttle
      the war by revolutionary fraternisation, by abolishing the power
      of the landowners in the local areas, by increasing the number
      and the power of the Soviets, and by introducing everywhere the
      elective principle.


The Narodnik and Menshevik ministerialists are spouting phrases
      about “democracy” in the abstract, about “Revolution” in the
      abstract in order to cover up their agreement with the
      imperialist, now definitely counter-revolutionary, bourgeoisie
      of their own country—an agreement which, in effect, is
      turning into a struggle against the revolution of the
      proletarians and semi-proletarians.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the replies of the French and British governments
      to the declaration of the Provisional Government of March 27
      (April 9), 1917, published in the newspapers on May 28 (June 10). The
      French Note (like the British) welcomed the intention
      of the Provisional Government to secure the independence of
      Poland, and mentioned France’s desire to fight in order to
      “liberate” Alsace-Lorraine and obtain indemnities from
      Germany. The British Note tried to justify Britain’s
      participation in the war. Both Notes expressed the hope of
      Russia’s continued co-operation in fighting to win the war.

The meeting of representatives of the capitalists and workers of
      the southern mining industry ended on May 23.


The meeting came to nothing. The capitalists found all
      the demands of the workers unacceptable. The workers’ delegation
      attending the meeting read a statement disclaiming all
      responsibility for possible complications.


The case is as clear as clear can be. The crisis has not been
      averted in the least. The employers have not been curbed.


And now we read—it would be amusing, were it not so
      sad—that it has been decided to appoint a committee made up
      of representatives of the government and the two conflicting
      parties (!) and that the employers have asked for an
      immediate increase in prices!


To give the reader an idea to what lengths the capitalists go in
      defying the people, we quote a few passages from a
      ministerial newspaper (i.e., the mouthpiece of a party
      that has representatives in the cabinet):



      “The workers’ delegation [from the southern mining industry]
      informed the Economic Department of the Executive Committee of
      the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies about the actual
      state of affairs. On the basis of this information, we can
      declare that the employers’ figures quoted by N. N. Kutler are
      absolutely untrustworthy.


      “The colliery owners had been making enormous profits before the
      revolution, and yet, just before its outbreak, they were
      haggling with the old government for a rise in the requisition
      prices on coal. In addition to the three kopeks which the
      government was willing to grant, the colliery owners were asking
      five more kopeks. From the revolutionary Provisional Government,
      on the other hand, they succeeded, during the very first days of
      the revolution, in obtaining a rise of eight kopeks, this new
      rate being extended to the old deliveries to the rail ways, and
      to requisitions dating back to January. Afterwards they managed
      to get three kopeks more, making a total of eleven kopeks.

 

      “Before the revolution the requisition price was eighteen
      kopeks; now it is twenty-nine. Government contracts at that time
      brought twenty two kopeks per pood, while now the prices are
      thirty-three and thirty-four and even more.”



What is this if not the most outrageous mockery of the
      people on the part of the capitalists?


Taking advantage of the revolution, the capitalist government,
      styling itself a “revolutionary” government and using this
      “noble” name to hoodwink the ignorant people, is putting more
      and more money into the pockets of the capitalists, helping them
      to amass more and more millions!


The country is on the verge of ruin, and the ten capitalist
      members of the Provisional Government are accommodating the
      employers who are looting the land, robbing the people, and
      swelling the colossal profits of capital.



      “The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is under the beck and
      call of the congress of the South Russian mine owners. Faced by
      the catastrophe towards which industry in the South is heading,
      it does nothing to avert it; on the contrary, it systematically
      submits to the pressure of the southern industrialists.”



Thus wrote the very same ministerial paper, the organ of the
      Mensheviks, Rabochaya Gazeta, on May 14, 1917, a week
      after the coalition cabinet was formed.


Since then absolutely nothing has changed.


But the ministerial paper has been forced to admit even more
      damaging facts. Listen to this:



      “The owners are sabotaging. They are deliberately letting things
      slide. If a pump is needed, no one looks for it. If wire gauze
      is needed for the miners safety lamps, it is not supplied. The
      owners do not want to increase production. Nor do they want to
      spend any money on essential repairs, or on replacing worn-out
      equipment. The machines are getting old, and will soon be out of
      commission. Frequently the workers themselves, when told that
      this or that article cannot be obtained, go out to buy the
      necessary tools, and they generally find what they need. The
      employers do nothing to ship their products, such as coal,
      cast-iron, etc. Products to the value of tens and hundreds of
      millions of rubles lie idle, while the country is in dire need
      of them.”



Thus wrote the ministerial paper, mouthpiece of that same
      Menshevik party to which Tsereteli and Skobelev belong.


This is sheer mockery of the people on the part of the
      capitalists. It’s like a madhouse, with the capitalists acting

    

in collusion with the bourgeois section of the Provisional
      Government (among the members of which are Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries), with the capitalists using
      obstruction and wrecking tactics, and
      doing nothing to ship their products, without which the
      country is facing ruin. 


Without coal, the factories and railways are coming to a
      stand. Unemployment is spreading. There is a shortage of
      goods. The peasants cannot part with their grain without getting
      anything in return. Famine is imminent.


And all this because of the capitalists, who are in collusion
      with the government!


And all this is tolerated by the Narodniks, the Socialist-
      Revolutionaries, and the Mensheviks! They dismiss the matter
      with, phrases. They wrote about these crimes of the capitalists
      on May 14. It is now May 31. Over a fortnight has
      passed. But nothing has changed. Famine is steadily approaching.


To cover up the crimes of the capitalists and distract the
      attention of the people, all the capitalist
      newspapers—Rech, Dyen, Novoye Vremya,
      Russkaya Volya, Birzheviye
      Vedomosti and Yedinstvo—vie with each other
      in daily emptying their slop pails of lies and calumny over the
      Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks are to blame for the colliery owners
      acting in collusion with the government, for their stopping and
      wrecking production!


This would indeed resemble a madhouse, were it not for the
      theory and world-wide experience of the class struggle which
      have shown us that the capitalists and their government
      (supported by the Mensheviks) will stop at nothing when it comes
      to safeguarding their profits.


When is this going to stop? Must we wait until disaster sweeps
      the land, and people begin to die of starvation by the hundred
      and the thousand?

Dear comrades,
    

I enclose a resolution of the Petrograd Committee concerning the
      establishment of a paper of its own, and two resolutions

      Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party at a meeting of the
      P.C. held on Tuesday,
May 30.[1]

      you please discuss these three resolutions and give us your
      well-considered opinion on them in the fullest possible detail.


On the question as to whether a separate paper for the Petrograd
      organisation is needed or not, the P.C. [Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik
      Party] and the C.C. [Central
      Committee of the Bolshevik Party]  hold conflicting
      views. It is essential and desirable that the greatest possible
      number of Party members in Petrograd should take an active part
      in the discussion of this growing conflict and help, by their
      decision, to settle it.


The Executive of the P.C. has expressed itself unanimously in
      favour of a separate press organ for the Petrograd Committee,
      despite the C.C.’s decision to establish two newspapers
      in place of Pravda, the size of which is obviously
      inadequate. These two papers are: the old Pravda, as
      the Party’s Central Organ, and a small Narodnaya Pravda
      (the names of the two papers have not yet been definitely
      decided

    

upon), as a popular organ for the masses. The two
      papers, according to the decision of the C.C., are to have a
      single editorial board, and the P.C. is to have a representative
      on each paper (one with a consultative voice on the Central
      Organ, and a voting representative on the popular organ). A
      Press Committee is to be set up (consisting of workers from the
      districts who are in close touch with the masses) and a definite
      number of columns in both papers are to be set aside
      for the needs of the local labour movement.


That is the plan of the C.C.


The Executive of the P.C., on the other hand, wants a special
      paper of its own. The Executive has decided upon this
      unanimously.


At the meeting of the P.C. held on May 30, after the report by
      Comrade M. Tomsky and his speech winding up the debate, after my
      own speech and the discussion in which many comrades
      participated, there was an equal division of votes—fourteen
      in favour of the Executive and fourteen against it. My motion
      was rejected by sixteen votes to twelve.


My own view is that there is no fundamental need for a special
      organ of the P.C. In view of the capital’s leading role
      and country-wide influence [Petrograd was
      the capital of Russia at the time], only one
      organ of the Party is needed there, namely, the Central Organ,
      and a popular pa per to be put out in a specially
      popular form by the same editorial board.


A special organ of the P.C. is bound to create obstacles towards
      harmonious work and may even give rise to different lines (or
      shadings) of policy, which would be extremely harmful,
      especially at a time of revolution.


Why should we split up our forces?


We are all terribly overworked and have few people to do the
      work; the party writers are siding more and more with the
      defencists. Under the circumstances we cannot afford any
      dispersion of efforts.


We must concentrate our efforts, not disperse them.


Are there
      any grounds for mistrusting the C.C., for believing that it will
      not select the editorial board properly, or not give sufficient
      space in both papers to local activities, or that it will
      “bully” the P.C.’s editors, who will be in the minority, and so
      on?

 

In my second draft resolution I specially listed some of these
      arguments (which I heard mentioned at the P.C. meeting on May
      30) in order to put the issue frankly before all members of the
      Party so as to make them weigh each of the two
      arguments carefully and arrive at a well-considered decision.


If you, comrades, have weighty and serious reasons for not
      trusting the C.C., then say so openly. It is the duty of every
      member of our democratically organised Party to do so, and then
      it would be the duty of our Party’s C.C. to give special
      consideration to this distrust of yours, report it to the Party
      congress and enter into special negotiations with a view to
      overcoming this deplorable lack of confidence in the C.C. on the
      part of the local organisation.


If there is no such lack of confidence, then it is unfair and
      wrong to challenge the C.C.’s right, vested in it by the Party
      congress, to direct the activities of the Party in
      general and its activities in the capital in particular.


Is our C.C. asking too much in wanting to direct the Petrograd
      papers? It is not. In the German Social-Democratic Party, in its
      best days, when Wilhelm Liebknecht stood at the head of the
      party for scores of years, he was the editor of the party’s
      Central Organ. The C.O. was published in Berlin. The Berlin
      organisation never had a special Berlin paper of its
      own. There was a Press Committee of workers, and there was a
      local section in the party’s Central Organ. Why should
      we depart from this good example which our comrades in other
      countries have set us?


If you, comrades, desire special guarantees from the
      C.C., if you want changes made in one or another point of the
      C.C.’s plan for the establishment of two papers, I would ask you
      on behalf of the C.C to carefully consider the matter and
      present your views.


I believe that the decision of the P.C.’s Executive to establish
      a special newspaper in Petrograd is utterly wrong and
      undesirable, because it splits up our forces and introduces into
      our Party the elements of conflict. In my opinion—and on
      this point I merely voice the view of the C.C.—it is
      desirable that the Petrograd organisation should support the

    

decision of the C.C., give itself time to check results from the
      experience of the two papers working according to the
      C.C.’s plan, and then, if need be, pass a special decision on
      the results of that experiment.


With comradely Social-Democratic greetings,


      May 31, 1917


N. Lenin

Comrade Avilov’s resolution shows a complete disregard for the
      class stand. B. V. Avilov would seem to have made up his mind in
      this resolution to collect together and concentrate all the
      faults common to all the resolutions of the petty-bourgeois
      parties.


Avilov’s resolution starts with the postulate, by now
      indisputable to any socialist, that capitalism’s robber economy
      has reduced Russia to complete economic and industrial ruin, but
      then goes on to propose the hazy formula of control of industry
      by “the state authorities” with the co-operation of the broad
      democratic mass.


Everybody nowadays is having a good deal to say about
      control. Even people who used to scream “murder” at the very
      mention of the word “control” now admit that control is
      necessary.


By using the term “control” in the abstract, however, they want
      to reduce the idea of control to naught.


The coalition government, which “socialists” have now joined,
      has done nothing yet in the way of putting this control into
      effect, and therefore it is quite understandable that the shop
      committees are demanding real workers’ control, and not control
      on paper.


In dealing with the idea of control and the question of when and
      by whom this control is to be effected, one must not for a
      single moment forget the class character of the modern state,
      which is merely an organisation of class rule.

    

    
A similar class analysis should be applied to the concept
      “revolutionary democracy”, and this analysis should be based on
      the actual balance of social forces.


Avilov’s resolution starts with a promise to give every thing,
      but ends, in effect, with a proposition to leave every thing as
      it was. There is not a shadow of revolutionism in the whole
      resolution.


In revolutionary times of all times it is necessary accurately
      to analyse the question as to the very essence of the state, as
      to whose interests it shall protect, and as to how it should be
      constructed in order effectively to protect the interests of the
      working people. In Avilov’s resolution this has not been dealt
      with at all.


Why is it that our new coalition government, which “socialists”
      have now joined, has not carried out control in the course of
      three months, and, what is more, in the conflict between the
      colliery owners and the workers of Southern Russia, the
      government has openly sided with the capitalists?


For control over industry to be effectively carried out it must
      be a workers’ control with a workers’ majority in all
      the leading bodies, and the management must give an account of
      its actions to all the authoritative workers’ organisations.


Comrades, workers, see that you get real control, not fictitious
      control, and reject in the most resolute manner all resolutions
      and proposals for establishing such a fictitious control
      existing only on paper.

The International Relations Department of the Executive
      Committee of the Petrograd Soviet has sent a letter to Huysmans,
      well-known as Secretary of the bankrupt Second International,
      whose members went over to the side of “their” national
      governments.


This letter, published in issue No. 78 of Izvestia,
      tries to prove that the Russian Narodniks and Mensheviks, who
      joined the bourgeois and imperialist government, cannot be
      “compared” to the West-European betrayers of socialism, who
      joined “their” governments. The “Department’s” case is so feeble
      and pitiful, so ludicrously impotent that it needs to be shown
      up again and again in all its unsightly futility.
    

Argument 1. In other countries these people joined the
      government “under entirely different conditions”. This is not
      true. The difference between Britain, France, Denmark, Belgium,
      Italy, etc., on the one hand, and present-day Russia, on the
      other, is “entirely” negligible. Everyone who has
      not betrayed socialism knows that the question at issue
      is the class rule of the bourgeoisie. In this
      respect conditions in all the countries mentioned above are the
      same, and not “different”. National peculiarities do not in the
      least affect the basic issue of bourgeois class rule.
    

Argument 2. “Our” ministers have joined a “revolutionary”
      government. This is a disgraceful method of hoodwinking the
      people by means of the great word “revolution”, which the
      Mensheviks and Narodniks use to cover up their betrayal of
      it. Everyone knows that ten of the sixteen ministers in today’s
      “revolutionary” government belong to the parties of the
      landowners and capitalists, who stand for the imperialist

    

war
      and non-publication of the secret treaties, and that these
      parties are now pursuing a counter-revolutionary
      policy. This was clearly demonstrated by the elections to the
      District Councils of Petrograd on May 27–29, when all
      the Black-Hundred elements rallied to support the
      majority in our “revolutionary” government.
    

Argument 3. “Our” ministers joined “with a definite man date to
      achieve world peace by agreement among the nations and not to
      drag out the imperialist war for The sake of liberating the
      nations by force of arms”. For one thing, this mandate is not
      “definite” at all, since it implies neither a definite
      programme nor any definite action. These are
      mere words. It is like the secretary of a labour union becoming
      an executive member of a capitalist association at a salary of
      10,000 rubles “with a definite mandate” to work for the welfare
      of labour and not drag out the rule of capitalism. Second,
      all imperialists, including Wilhelm and Poincaré,
      are out for “an agreement among the nations”. This, too, is an
      empty phrase. Third, the war on Russia’s part, since May 6,
      1917, is obviously being “dragged out”, among other reasons,
      because our imperialist government has so far failed to announce
      or propose clear and precise terms of peace, terms of an
      agreement.
    

Argument 4. “Our” ministers aim is not cessation of the class
      struggle, but its continuation by means of the instruments of
      political power”. Splendid! All you need to do is to cloak
      vileness with a good aim or a good excuse for participation in
      vileness—and the trick is done! Participation in a
      bourgeois imperialist government, which is actually
      waging an imperialist war, may, it appears, be called
      “continuation of the class struggle by means of instruments of
      political power”. This is a perfect gem. We suggest that at
      every workers’ and public meeting three cheers should be raised
      for Chernov, Tsereteli, Peshekhionov and Skobelev, who are
      waging “a class struggle” against Tereshchenko, Lvov
      and Co.
    

You will be laughed to scorn, gentlemen of the “Department”, for
      defending ministerialism with such arguments. You are not
      original, though. The famous Vandervelde, friend of Plekhanov
      (whom you scold, although, since you have joined the cabinet,
      you have no moral right to do so),

    

said long ago that he, too,
      had joined the cabinet “to continue the class struggle”.
    

Argument 5. “Our” ministers joined the cabinet after the
      overthrow of tsarism and the expulsion of the enemies of the
      Russian proletariat [i.e., Milyukov and Guchkov] by the movement
      of the revolutionary mass on April 20–21”.
    

You can hardly blame the French for having overthrown their
      autocracy 122 years ago, instead of 100 days ago, or the English
      for having done it over 260 years ago, or the Italians for
      having done it decades ago. April 20 saw Milyukov ejected and
      replaced by Tereshchenko, i.e., absolutely nothing has changed
      as far as class or party relations are concerned. New promises
      do not imply a new policy.
    

You could dismiss the Metropolitan and put the Pope in his
      place, but that does not mean you would cease to be a clerical.
    

Argument 6. In Russia “there is full freedom for the proletariat
      and the army”. That is untrue—it is not full. It
      is fuller than in other countries, and all the more shameful
      therefore is it to soil this young unsullied freedom
      with the dirt of participation in a bourgeois imperialist
      government.
    

The Russian betrayers of socialism differ from their European
      namesakes no more than the rapist differs from the ravisher.
    

Argument 7. “Moreover the Russian proletariat has the means of
      exercising complete control over those it elects.”
    

That is untrue. Partyism in Russia is so young and
      disintegration among the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries is so evident (Martov’s
      semi-breakaway, Kamkov’s protests and his forming a bloc with
      us at the elections against his own party, the
      Menshevik-S.R. bloc with Yedinstvo, which they
      themselves call imperialist, etc.) that there can be no
      question of any serious, not to say “complete”, control of the
      ministers on the part of the proletariat.
    

Besides, proletariat is a class concept, which the
      Mensheviks and Narodniks have no right to use, because they rely
      mostly on the support of the petty bourgeoisie. Once
      you speak of classes, be precise!
    

Argument 8. “The fact that representatives of the Russian
      socialist [?] proletariat [?] have joined the government does

    

not imply any weakening of its bonds with the socialists of all
      countries who are fighting against imperialism. On the contrary,
      it signifies a strengthening of those bonds in the joint
      struggle for world peace.”
    

That is untrue. A mere phrase.
    

Everyone knows that their joining the government in Russia has
      strengthened the bonds that unite the
      adherents of imperialism, the social-chauvinists, the
      social-imperialists of all countries—Henderson and
      Co., Thomas and Co., Scheidemann and Co.
    

Yes, Scheidemann, too! For he realises that
      German social-imperialism will be safe to
      continue exercising its baneful influence on the world’s labour
      movement, since even the Russians, their great measure
      of freedom and their revolution notwithstanding, have entered
      into a shameful alliance with their imperialist
      bourgeoisie.

Novaya Zhizn today publishes a resolution introduced by
      Comrade Avilov at a meeting of shop committees. Unfortunately,
      this resolution must be regarded as an example of a
      petty-bourgeois attitude that is neither Marxist nor
      socialist. Because this resolution accentuates in sharp focus
      all the weaknesses peculiar to the Menshevik and Narodnik Soviet
      resolutions, it is typical and worthy of attention.


The resolution begins with an excellent general statement, with
      a splendid indictment of the capitalists: “The present economic
      debacle ... is a result of the war and the predatory
      anarchic rule of the capitalists and the government.”
      Correct! That capital is oppressive, that it is a predator, that
      it is the original source of anarchy—in this the petty
      bourgeois is ready to agree with the proletariat. But there the
      similarity ends. The proletarian regards capitalist economy as a
      robber economy, and therefore wages a class struggle against it,
      shapes his whole policy on unconditional distrust of the
      capitalist class, and in dealing with the question of the state
      his first concern is to distinguish which class the “state”
      serves, whose class interests it stands for. The petty
      bourgeois, at times, gets “furious” with capital, but as soon as
      the fit of anger is over he goes back to his old faith in the
      capitalists, to the hopes placed in the “state”.., of the
      capitalists!


The same thing has happened with Comrade Avilov.


After a splendid, strongly worded, formidable introduction
      accusing the capitalists and even the government of the
      capitalists of running a “robber” economy, Comrade Aviloy,
      throughout his resolution, in all its concrete substance

    

and all
      its practical proposals, forgets the class stand point,
      and, like the Mensheviks and Narodniks, lapses into bombast
      about the “state” in general, about “revolutionary democracy” in
      the abstract.


Workers! Predatory capital is creating anarchy and economic
      chaos, and the government of the capitalists, too, is ruling by
      anarchy. Salvation lies in control on the part of “the state
      with the co-operation of revolutionary democracy”. This is the
      substance of Avilov’s resolution.


What are you talking about, Comrade Avilov! How can a Marxist
      forget that the state is an organ of class rule? Is it not
      ridiculous to appeal to a capitalist state to take
      action against “predatory capitalists”?


How can a Marxist forget that in the history of all countries
      the capitalists, too, have often been “revolutionary democrats”,
      as in England in 1649, in France in 1789, in 1830, 1848, and
      1870, and in Russia in February 1917?


Can you have forgotten that the revolutionary democracy of the
      capitalists, of the petty bourgeoisie and of the proletariat
      must be distinguished one from the other? Does not the
      whole history of all the revolutions I have
      just mentioned show a distinction of classes within
      “revolutionary democracy”?


To continue in Russia to speak of “revolutionary democracy” in
      general after the experience of February, March, April and May
      1917 is to deceive the people knowingly or unknowingly,
      consciously or unconsciously. The “moment” of general fusion of
      classes against tsarism has come and gone. The very first
      agreement between the first “Provisional Committee” of the Duma
      and the Soviet marked the end of the class fusion and
      the beginning of the class struggle.


The April crisis (April 20), followed by that of May 6, then May
      27–29 (the elections), etc., etc., have brought about a definite
      cleavage of classes in the Russian revolution within
      the Russian “revolutionary democracy”. To ignore this is to sink
      to the helpless level of the petty bourgeois.


To appeal now to the “state” and to “revolutionary democracy” on
      the matter of predatory capitalism of all questions, is to drag
      the working class backward. In effect it means
      preaching complete stoppage of the revolution. For our “state”
      today, after April, after May, is a state of “predator”
      capitalists,

    

who, in the persons of Chernov, Tsereteli and Co.,
      have tamed a fairly considerable portion of
      “revolutionary (petty-bourgeois) democracy”.
    

This state is hindering the revolution everywhere, in
      all fields of home and foreign policy.
    

To hand over to this state the job of fighting the
      capitalist “predators” is like throwing the pike into the
      river.[1]

Algeria let them down.... Our ministerial
      “Socialist-Revolutionaries” had almost succeeded in stunning the
      public—and themselves—into believing all their talk about
      “peace without annexations”, but ... Algeria let them
      down. Dyelo Naroda, a newspaper to which two
      Socialist-Revolutionary ministers, Kerensky and Chernov,
      contribute, was incautious enough to invite the views of three
      Allied cabinet ministers (belonging to the same near-socialist
      camp) on Algeria. How terribly careless this was on the part of
      the newspaper of the Kerenskys and Chernovs will be seen from
      the following.
    

The three Allied ministers—Henderson, Thomas and
      Vandervelde of Britain, France and Belgium, stated that they did
      not want “annexation”, but only “liberation of territories”. The
      paper of the Kerenskys and Chernovs described this—quite
      rightly—as a “sleight of hand” on the part of the “tamed
      socialists”, and poured out on them the following angry and
      sarcastic tirade:
    


      “True, they [the three ministers] demand the liberation of
      territories’ only ’in conformity with the will of the
      population’. Very well! But in that case we ought to demand that
      they, and we, be consistent and recognise the ’liberation’ of
      Ireland and Finland on the one hand, and Algeria or Siam on the
      other. It would be very interesting to hear the opinion of, say,
      the socialist Albert Thomas on ’self-determination’ for
      Algeria.”
    


Indeed, “it would be very interesting to hear the opinion” also
      of Kerensky, Tsereteli, Chernov and Skobelev on “self-determination”
      for Armenia, Galicia, Ukraine, and Turkestan.
    

Don’t you see, you Narodnik and Menshevik members of the Russian
      Government, that by citing the example of

    

Ireland and Algeria
      you have exposed the whole lie and falsity of your own position
      and behaviour. You have shown that “annexation” cannot
      be interpreted merely as the seizure of territory in this
      war. In other words, you have refuted yourselves and
      Izvestia of the Petrograd Soviet which only the other
      day declared with proud ignorance that the term annexation could
      be applied only to territories seized in the present war. But
      who does not know that Ireland and Algeria were annexed decades
      and centuries before the outbreak of this war?
    

Careless, very careless of Dyelo Naroda! It has exposed
      its utter confusion of ideas, and that of the Mensheviks and
      Ivestia, on such a key issue as annexations.
    

Nor is that all. You question Henderson about Ireland, and
      Albert Thomas about Algeria; you contrast the views on
      annexation of the “French bourgeoisie now in power”
      with the views of the French people; you call Henderson
      and Albert Thomas “tamed socialists”—but what about your
      selves?
    

What are you, Kerensky, Tsereteli, Chernov, Skobelev, if not
      “tamed socialists”? Did you raise the question of the
      Russian Ireland and the Russian Algeria, i.e.,
      of Turkestan, Armenia, Ukraine, Finland, etc., before the
      government of the “Russian bourgeoisie now in power”?
      When did you raise this question? Why don’t you tell the Russian
      “people” about it? Why don’t you qualify as “sleight of hand”
      the Russian Narodniks’ and Mensheviks’ blether about
      “peace without annexations” in the Soviet, in the government and
      before the people, without raising, clearly and
      unambiguously, the question of all Russian annexations
      of the same type as Ireland and Algeria?
    

The Russian ministeriable Narodniks and Mensheviks are in a
      hopeless muddle; every passing day adds to their self-exposure.
    

Their “final” stock argument is that we are having a
      revolution. But that argument is false from beginning to
      end. For our revolution so far has only brought the
      bourgeoisie to power, as in France and Britain, with a
      “harmless minority” of “tamed socialists”, as in France and
      Britain. What our revolution will produce tomorrow—whether
      a return to the monarchy, the strengthening of the bourgeoisie,
      or the transfer

    

of power to more advanced classes—neither
      we nor anyone else knows. Consequently, the plea of “revolution”
      in general is a gross deception of the people and of oneself.
    

The annexation issue is a good touchstone for the Narodniks and
      Mensheviks, who are entangled in a web of lies. They are
      just as muddled as Plekhanov, Henderson, Schieidemann
      and Co.; they are distinguishable from each other only in
      words, for as far as deeds are concerned they are
      all alike—dead to socialism.

The Petrograd Telegraph Agency reports:
    


      “Kiev, May 30. A telegram from War Minister Kerensky
      read at the All-Ukraine Peasant Congress stated that for
      military reasons the convocation of the second Ukrainian army
      congress was considered untimely. The Congress held the
      Minister’s order to be an infringement of the Ukrainians’ right
      of, assembly and sent the following telegram to the Provisional
      Government and the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies;
    

      “‘We call sour attention to this first case of
      infringement of
      the right of assembly on the part of Minister Kerensky in
      respect of the Ukrainian army congress. We decline all
      responsibility for the possible consequences of this
      infringement of democratic principles of the new life in respect
      of the Ukrainians. We lodge an emphatic protest and await the
      Provisional Government’s immediate reply to the demands
      submitted by the delegation of the Ukrainian Central Rada.’”
  


This report will undoubtedly cause great concern among the
      socialist workers.
    

The War Minister deems the congress of Ukrainians “untimely” and
      uses his power to ban it! Not so long ago citizen Kerensky tried
      to bring Finland to heel, and now he has decided to bring the
      Ukrainians to heel. And all this is done in the name of
      “democracy”!
    

      A. I. Herzen once said that when you look at the antics of
      Russia’s ruling classes you feel ashamed of being a
      Russian.[1] This was said at a time when
      Russia was groaning under the yoke of serfdom, when the land was
      ruled by the knout and the rod.
    

Today Russia has overthrown the tsar. Today the Kerenskys and
      the Lvovs speak in the name of Russia. Russia of the Kerenskys
      and Lvovs treats her subject nations in such a way that one
      cannot help recalling these bitter words of Herzen’s.

 

We say nothing of the fact that by his “dominant-nation” policy
      Citizen Kerensky is merely augmenting and bolstering the very
      tendencies towards “separatism” which the Kerenskys and the
      Lvovs are trying to smother.


We ask: Is such treatment of the oppressed nationalities
      compatible with plain democracy, let alone socialism? We ask: Is
      there a limit to the “antics” of Citizen Kerensky and his
      followers?


We ask the Party of the “Socialist-Revolutionaries” whether it
      subscribes to this step taken by its honourable member, Citizen
      Kererensky, in banning the Ukrainian congress.
    
 *     *  * 

We are informed that the Executive Committee of the Soviet
      yesterday decided to invite Citizen Kerensky specially to
      discuss with him the question of self-determination of nations
      and the question of national policy in general.


Yet people had been saying that the Contact Commission was
      dead. Nothing of the sort, gentlemen! Dual power still
      exists. The only way out of the present situation is to have all
      power pass to the Soviets.

Everybody is screaming for “strong government”. The only
      salvation is in a dictatorship, in “iron discipline”, in
      silencing and reducing to obedience all the refractory members
      of the Right and Left. We know whom they wish to
      silence. The Rights are making no noise, they are
      working. Some of them in the government, others at the
      factories, all of them with threats of lockouts, orders for the
      disbanding of regiments, and the threat of penal servitude. The
      Konovalovs and the Tereshchenkos, with the help of the Kerenskys
      and the Skobelevs, are working in an organised manner
      for their own good. And they don’t have to be silenced.


All we have is the right of speech.


And of this right they want to deprive us.


Pravda is barred from the front. The Kiev “agents” have
      decided not to distribute Pravda. The Zemstvo Union is
      not selling Pravda in its newspaper stands. And now we
      are promised a “systematic fight against the preaching of
      Leninism” (Izvestia). On the other hand, every
      spontaneous protest, every excess, wherever it comes from, is
      blamed on us.
      


This, too, is a method for combating Bolshevism.


A well-tried method.


Unable as they are to get clear guidelines, aware instinctively
      how false and unsatisfactory is the position of the official
      leaders of democracy, the masses are compelled to grope a
      way out for themselves.


The result is that every dissatisfied, class-conscious
      revolutionary, every angered fighter who yearns for his village
      home and sees no end to the war, and sometimes simply men

    

who
      are out to save their own skins, rally to the banner of
      Bolshevism.


Where Bolshevism has a chance to air its views openly, there we
      find no disorganisation.


Where there are no Bolsheviks or where they are not allowed to
      speak, there we find excesses, demoralisation, and
      pseudo-Bolsheviks.


And that is just what our enemies need.


They need a pretext for saying: “The Bolsheviks are
      demoralising the army” and then shutting the Bolsheviks’
      mouths.


To dispose once for all of “enemy” slander and the ridiculous
      distortions of Bolshevism, we quote the concluding part of a
      leaflet distributed in the army by one of our delegates on the
      eve of the All-Russia Congress.


Here it is:



      “Comrades, you must have your say.


      “Do not let us have any agreements with the bourgeoisie?


      “All power to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies!


      “This does not mean that we must immediately overthrow the
      present government or disobey it. So long as the majority of the
      peoples support it and believe that five socialists can cope
      with all the rest, we cannot afford to fritter away our forces
      in desultory uprisings.


      “Never!


      “Husband your strength! Get together at meetings! Pass
      resolutions! Demand that all power be handed over to the Soviet
      of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies! Convince those who disagree
      with us! Send your resolution to me at the Congress in Petrograd
      in the name of your regiment, so that I can quote your voice
      there!


      “But beware of those who, posing as Bolsheviks, will try to
      provoke you to riots and disturbances as a screen for their own
      cowardice! Know that though they are with you now, they will
      sell you out to the old regime at the first hint of danger.


      “The real Bolsheviks call you to conscious revolutionary
      struggle, and not to riots.


      “Comrades! The All-Russia Congress will elect representatives,
      to whom, pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly,
      the Provisional Government will be accountable.


      “Comrades! At that Congress I shall demand:


      “First,that all power be handed over to the Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
      


      “Second, that a proposal for peace without annexations or
      indemnities be made Immediately in the name of our people
      to the peoples and governments of all the belligerent
      nations, both our Allies and our enemies. If any government
      tries to turn it down it will be overthrown by its
      own people.

 

      “Third, that the money which people have made out of the war
      should be converted to state needs by wag of confiscation of
      the capitalists’ war profits.
      


      “Comrades! Only by the transfer of power to the democracy in
      Russia, Germany, and France, only by the overthrow of the
      bourgeois governments in all countries, can the war be ended.
      


      “Our revolution lies started this, and it is our task now to
      give a further impetus to the world revolution by having a fully
      authorised popular Russian government make an order of peace to
      all the governments of Europe and by strengthening our alliance
      with the revolutionary democrats of Western Europe.
      


      “Woe betide the bourgeois government that will persist in
      continuing the war after this.
      


      “Together with Its people we shall make revolutionary war
      upon that government.
      


      “It is to say all this to our government In Petrograd in your
      name that I have been elected to the Congress in Petrograd.


      “Member of the Army Committee of the 11th Army, Delegate of the
      Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
      (Bolsheviks) to the Congress of the South-Western Front, Ensign
      Krylenko.”



No one who has taken the trouble to read our Party’s resolutions
      can fail to see that the gist of them has been
      correctly expressed by Comrade Krylenko.


The Bolsheviks are calling the proletariat, the poor peasants
      and all the toiling and exploited people to a conscious
      revolutionary struggle, and not to riots and disturbances.


Only a genuine government of the people, a government belonging
      to the majority of the nation, is capable of following
      the right path leading mankind to the overthrow of the
      capitalist yoke, to deliverance from the horrors and misery of
      the imperialist war, and to a just and lasting peace.

      “King Constantine [of Greece] signed the act of abdication under
      pressure from Allied diplomacy.” writes the newspaper of
      Mr. Milyukov, ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional
      “revolutionary” Government.
    

The Allied diplomats have completed the subjugation of Greece by
      first sparking off the Venizelos movement (Venizelos is a former
      minister of Constantine’s who entered the service of the British
      capitalists), causing a split in the army, seizing part of Greek
      territory, and finally using “pressure” to force the abdication
      of the “lawful” monarch, i.e.. to force a revolution from
      above. What kind of “pressure” that was and is everybody
      knows. It was pressure by starvation. Greece was
      blockaded by the warships of the Anglo-French and Russian
      imperialists and left without bread. The “pressure” on
      Greece was of the same order as that recently applied in Russia
      by the ignorant peasants of some out-of-the-way village, who,
      if we are to believe the newspapers. condemned a citizen to
      death by starvation for having allegedly insulted the Christian
      religion.
    

The ignorant peasants in some godforsaken hole in Russia starved
      a “criminal” to death. The “civilised” imperialists of Britain,
      France, Russia, etc., starved a whole country, a whole
      nation, to force it, by “pressure”, to change its policy.
    

There we have the reality of the imperialist war. There
      we have the real state of international relations at the present
      time. The S.R. gentlemen laugh at this. It is really funny, very
      funny....
    

Dyelo Naroda, the ministerial paper of Kerensky,
      Chernov and Co., publishes a laughing editorial entitled:
      “‘Self-determination’ for Greece”. The S.R.s’ sarcasm

 of Greek “self determination” would have been
      admirable had it been sincere.
    
 

Sincerity in politics does not mean that Kerensky, Chernov and
      Co. have to prove their personal sincerity—we readily take
      that for granted. That is not the point. Sincerity in politics,
      that is, in that sphere of human relations which involves, not
      individuals, but the millions, is a correspondence
      between word and deed that lends itself to verification.
    

The editorial in Dyelo Naroda is insincere because it
      is precisely the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, precisely the
      Kerenskys and the Chernovs, as its leaders, who support
      the Ministry of subjugation ... I beg your pardon, the Ministry
      of Greek “self-determination”, together with citizens Tsereteli
      and Skobelev.
    

      “It is clear to everyone,” writes Dyelo Naroda, “that
      there is no essential difference between imperialist Germany’s
      robber attack on Belgium, Austria’s attack on Serbia, and the
      present advance into the interior of Greece’ on the part of the
      Allied governments.”
    

Yes, this is clear, and this is not at all a question of
      “ethics”, as the S.R.s believe, but a matter of pure politics. A
      robber attack—that. is what you are participating
      in, citizens S.R.s, citizens Mensheviks, as members of the
      government. The robber attack is an established fact, and
      “pressure from Allied diplomacy”—from all the Allies,
      including Russia—was apparently applied also
      after Chernov, Tsereteli and Co. joined the cabinet.
    

And what about the platforms of “peace without annexations”?
      What about the “demands” of “revolutionary democracy” from the
      new government? What about the declarations? Surely it is clear
      by this time that all these platforms, declarations, promises,
      statements, pledges, vows, etc., etc., are a sheer
      mockery of the people.
    

The laugh is on you, gentlemen of the S.R. and Menshevik fold!
      You are laughing at your own policy of trust in the capitalists
      and the government of the capitalists! You arc laughing at your
      own role of eloquent and bombastic servants of capitalism and
      imperialism, servants in the rank of ministers!
