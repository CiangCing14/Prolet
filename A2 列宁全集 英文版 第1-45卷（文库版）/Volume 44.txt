Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs instruction was written on an order to the Red Guard
Staff issued by the Military Revolutionary Committee of the
Petrograd Soviet. The order gave instructions for petrol, four
artillery batteries, three motorcars, field telephones and cyclists
or motorcyclists to be dispatched to the Pulkovo headquarters
at positions near Tsarskoye Selo.

The order called for the dispatch of petrol, a motorcar, two
artillery batteries, sappers for trench-digging, motorcycle or
bicycle messengers and maps of the locality, to the Staff of the
Izmailovo Regiment on the main road to Moscow. The Military
Revolutionary Committee proposed also that âa joint staff for
the operation as a wholeâ should be set up and food supplies
organised for the Red Guard.

I earnestly request the Petrograd Committee immediately
 to pass a decision against conciliation and to put it before
the
C.C.[1] 

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a resolution of the Petrograd Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) on the question of setting up a âhomogeneous
socialist governmentâ of representatives from various parties and
organisations âfrom the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialistsâ.
The demand for such a government came from the Mensheviks
and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who counted on playing the
leading role in it. Their proposal had the support of some of the
members of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)âL. B. Kamenev,
G.Â Y. Zinoviev, A.Â I. Rykov and their few adherents. The C.C.
of the Bolshevik Party at a sitting held on November 2(15), 1917,
strongly condemned the Right-opportunist, conciliatory attitude
of the capitulators (see present edition, Vol.Â 26, pp. 277â79).
Apparently, this note of Leninâs was written daring the sitting
of the Central Committee.

The note was read out at a sitting of the Petrograd Committee
of the Party. In a resolution on the current situation, the
Petrograd Committee stated that the government in the proletarian
republic had to be a government of the Soviets of Workersâ,
Soldiersâ and Peasantsâ Deputies, that the task of Soviet power was
to put into effect the revolutionary programme advanced by the
Bolsheviks, and that any departure from it was impermissible.
This resolution was sent to the Party Central Committee.

On November 3 (16), the Central Committee presented an
ultimatum to the opposition minority demanding complete

 Â  

subordination to the decisions of the Central Committee (see present
edition, Vol.Â 26, pp. 280â82). The conciliators, however, refused
to submit to Party discipline, and resigned from the Central
Committee and the Council of Peopleâs Commissars. The Central
Committee branded them as saboteurs (see present edition, Vol.Â 26,
pp. 301â02). New people, loyal to the cause of the Party, were
brought into the government.

Comrade Sverdlov

The bearer has a mandate from the local Soviet.

He wants to work in Petrograd.

Makes an excellent impression.

He wants âmilitantâ work among the masses (as agitator,
etc.).

I strongly advise you to give him an opportunity at once
to prove his worth in work among the masses in
Petrograd.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter to Y.Â M. Sverdlov apparently concerns F.Â F. Obraztsov,
who had been received by Lenin as the representative from the
peasants of four volosts of Tver Gubernia.

At the top of the letter, Lenin wrote the words: âFirst floor,
roomÂ 39.â This was the room in Smolny where Y.Â M. Sverdlov
worked after his election on NovemberÂ 8 (21), 1917, as Chairman
of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.

I am ready to reply to your questions if you give me an
absolutely formal and precise guarantee, first, that you
will inform the entire labour press, i.e., also the press
organs of an internationalist trend (Heywood, the S.L.P.
in America, Tom Mann and the British Socialist Party in
Britain, Loriot and his friends in France, etc.), and
secondly, that my reply will be reproduced without any
alterations, that is to say, you have the right not to publish
my reply, but if you do publish it you have no right to
change anything in my text.

Who is the responsible representative of your â
International Associationâ here, in London, New York and Paris?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter because the representative of the
International Association for Information of the Labour Press of America,
France, and Great Britain, the Rumanian journalist Nicolae Cocea,
at that time in Petrograd, had requested him on behalf of the
Association to reply to the following six questions: =

â1) Will the
Government of Peopleâs Commissars continue with the same vigour
its former home policy and its international efforts on behalf
of peace? =

2) What great reforms are being planned by the present
government for establishing a socialist system in Russia? =

3) After
the Constituent Assembly is convened will the Government of
Peopleâs Commissars be responsible to it as in constitutional
states, or not? =

4) Do you think that the peace Russia proposes
will put an end to militarism throughout the world? =

5) When and
how do you intend to begin demobilising the Russians? =

6) Do you
think that with the present state of Europe the complete
realisation of socialism is possible?â

In a letter in reply to Lenin, Nicolae Cocea assured him that
his conditions in regard to the publication of his replies would
be fully observed. Lenin wrote on Coceaâs letter: âReply given
10/XI. 1917.â Leninâs replies to the questions put to him have
not been found.

The document published here was discovered in Rumania.
In 1960 the Central Committee of the Rumanian Workersâ Party
presented it to the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.

You have proposed to me the organisation of a group of
staff officers and generals who have a higher military
education and who wish to work out the military and technical
problems of an armistice that would permit Russia, without
violation of her interests, to secure the suspension of
hostilities.

In view of the extreme urgency of this matter, I would
earnestly request you to get your group together at once,
tomorrow morning, and to send me tomorrow evening at
least a brief outline of the main problems, points and
provisions of an armistice agreement (demarcation of the
front line, stipulation that no troops be moved to other
fronts, control measures, etc., etc.), and also to indicate
the person or persons who would be fully competent to
take part directly in the negotiations.

Please send me a reply by messenger.

 To the P.C.

Can one of the comrades write and tell me whether a
resolution on courts of law was adopted yesterday in the
Petrograd Soviet and what has been done
practically?[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On November 22 (December 5), 1917, the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars adopted a decree on courts of law, which was
published the following day in the newspaper Pravda. On NovemberÂ 24
(DecemberÂ 7), in connection with this decree, the question of
courts of law was discussed at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet
of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies. The Soviet passed a
resolution approving the decree and indicated practical measures for
its implementation. The district Soviets were instructed to
immediately begin the election of local judges.

  The Hanecki affair

On the question of Hanecki, the narrow C.C. has passed
a decision not to appoint him as representative in
Stockholm.

That is to say, it rescinded the previous decision of the C.C.

I propose that this decision be countermanded on the
following grounds.

What are the arguments against Hanecki?

He is known since 1903; a member of the Polish C.C.
who worked for many years as a C.C. member; we saw his
work in Cracow, his trips to Russia, etc., we saw him at all
congresses, etc., etc.

The arguments are merely a campaign of bourgeois
slanders, Zaslavskyâs outcries.

It would be quite unworthy of a workersâ party to show
such credulity to intellectualist scandal. Let someone prove
anything bad about Hanecki first, before we remove
him.

âBut Hanecki traded with Parvus,â they âallâ say.
 

Hanecki earned his living as an employee in a commercial
firm of which Parvus was a shareholder. That is what
Hanecki told me. It has not been refuted.

Is it forbidden to work in capitalist commercial
undertakings? Where? By what decision of the Party?

Are there no people among us who work in commercial
firms of Russian, British and other capitalists?

Or is it permissible to be a technician, a manager or an
employee of Russian capitalists, but not of German, even
when living in a neutral country?? And is that to be the
decision of an âinternationalistâ party??

Let it decide frankly, let it pass a general resolution,
let it give grounds for the step taken against
Hanecki.

When Bukharin wanted to go and work in Parvusâs
business as a writer, we dissuaded him, for after all it is not
a commercial firm. But while we dissuaded him, we did
not denounce the
Mensheviks[1] in Parvusâs employ. We did
not denounce Zurabov and a host of others, we did not
accuse them.

Who accused them, and where?

Why is it that up to now we have not questioned the
Mensheviks and others who lived in Copenhagen and knew
of Haneckiâs commercial occupation and who did not
condemn him? We could and should have done that.

Not a single fact against Hanecki has been established,
no ban has been passed on being employed in capitalist
commercial firms of all countries, no check has been made
on the rumours and slanders of notorious slanderers like
Zaslavskyâyet the man is to be âremovedâ?? There is
nothing here but âfearâ of the slanders of irresponsible
slanderers.

It is unworthy of a working-class party to be so
credulous of scandal. If the comrades who succumb to scandal
are âperturbedâ, âworriedâ, why shouldnât they exert
themselves a little? Isnât it better to take some pains to find
the truth than to repeat scandal? In Petrograd itself it is
possible (if a perturbed comrade wants to go to some
trouble and not decide things offhand) to find witnesses from
Copenhagen, and in Moscow too. Why donât, the anonymous
accusers of Hanecki in the ranks of our Party do that??
 

Such treatment of an absent comrade, who has worked
for more than ten years, is the height of injustice.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Mensheviksâan opportunist trend among Russian Socialâ
Democrats, one of the varieties of international opportunism. It was

 Â  

formed at the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (in 1903) out
of the opponents of the Leninist Iskra. At this Congress the
election of the Partyâs central bodies resulted in Leninâs
supporters winning a majority (the Russian word for majority is 
bolshinstvo) and they were therefore called Bolsheviks, while the
opportunists were left in the minority (in Russian menshinstvo) and were
given the name Mensheviks.

The Mensheviks came out against the Partyâs revolutionary
programme. They were opposed to the hegemony of the proletariat
in the revolution, and the alliance of the working class and the
peasantry, and were in favour of an agreement with the liberal
bourgeoisie.

After the defeat of the 1905â07 revolution the Mensheviks
wanted to liquidate the illegal proletarian revolutionary party.
In January 1912, the Sixth All-Russia Party Conference expelled
the Menshevik liquidators from the R.S.D.L.P.

In 1917 representatives of the Mensheviks entered the bourgeois
Provisional Government, and after the victory of the Great October
Socialist Revolution the Mensheviks together with the other
counter-revolutionary parties waged a struggle against Soviet
power.

Leninâs name was put on the list of candidates to the Constituent
Assembly from the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) by
five electoral areas: Petrogradâthe capital, Petrograd Gubernia,
Ufa, the Baltic Fleet and the Northern Front. In addition, Lenin
was nominated as the candidate to the Constituent Assembly
from Moscow. The elections to the Constituent Assembly were
held on NovemberÂ 12 (25), 1917. On NovemberÂ 27 (DecemberÂ 10)
the All-Russia Committee for Elections to the Constituent
Assembly requested members of the Constituent Assembly who had been
returned by several areas to present a written statement
indicating the area for which they accepted election. Having been
elected by several areas, Lenin, too, presented such a statement. (See

8.XII.1917

    To the P.C.

Please send not less than 100 persons, absolutely reliable
Party members, to room No.Â 75, second floorâthe
Committee to Combat Looting. (For performance of commissar
duties.)[1]

The matter is extremely important. The Party is
responsible. Approach the districts and factories.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In November and December 1917, counter-revolutionary elements
in Petrograd organised the looting of liquor stores and shops.

A state of siege was declared in Petrograd. A committee to
combat looting was set up under the Petrograd Soviet. G.Â I.
Blagonravov was appointed Military Commissar Extraordinary of
Petrograd to combat drunkenness and looting.

On December 5â6 (18â19), a counter-revolutionary
organisation led by Constitutional-Democrats and Black-Hundred
elements, which aimed at overthrowing Soviet rule and restoring
the monarchy, was discovered. It allocated large sums of money
for looting and provocations as one of the means of struggle,
organised gangs and issued special leaflets.

Comrade Obolensky,

I recommend to you the bearer, Comrade Solovyov (
telephone 265â24), an expert on the oil industry and the
author of a plan for nationalisation. He should be used!

V.Â Ulyanov

I gave his memorandum (on the oil industry) to
Shlyapnikov. There is a copy for you too (Shlyapnikov has
it).[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his memorandum addressed to Lenin, A.Â S. Solovyov drew
attention to the Ukhta oilfields and asked that an order be
issued to have them inspected and exploited. He enclosed with the
memo a detailed description of the qualities of the Ukhta oil
based on analyses of it.

Today, the Ukhta district (Komi A.S.S.R.) has a
well-developed oil industry, with enterprises for oil extraction and
processing.

21/XIIâ1917

Dear Citizen Charles Dumas,

My wife and I recall with great pleasure the time we
met you in Paris, rue Bonier. We are very grateful to you
for the exchange of ideas and for the very accurate
information on the socialist movement in France.

I very much regret that personal relations between us
became impossible after such profound political differences
divided us. Throughout the war I fought against the
ânational defenceâ trend, I always stood for a split, being
convinced that that tendency was ruining socialism
completely.

It goes without saying that I am writing this letter not
as a member of the government but as a private individual.

Please accept our greetings, dear citizen, and best wishes
from my wife and myself.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On his arrival in Petrograd in December 1917, the French
socialist Charles Dumas asked Lenin to receive him, mentioning
that they were already acquainted. Lenin and Krupskaya
met Charles Dumas in Paris, where they lived from December
1908 to June 10 (23), 1912.

During the First World War (1914â18), Dumas held
social-chauvinist views, for which Lenin sharply criticised him in his
work The Collapse of the Second International (see present
edition, Vol.Â 21, pp. 209â10).

The Council of Peopleâs Commissars is confident that
Comrade Antonov will continue as before to act in close
contact with the central Ukrainian Soviet authorities who
were greeted by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars, and
with the Commissar Extraordinary appointed by the
C.P.C.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On DecemberÂ 12 (25), 1917, the First All-Ukraine Congress of
Soviets held in Kharkov proclaimed the Ukraine a Soviet
Republic and elected the All-Ukraine Central Executive Committee
of Soviets. In a telegram to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
on DecemberÂ 13 (26), the Ukrainian Central Executive Committee
proclaimed the unity of interests of the peoples of the Ukraine
and Soviet Russia. On DecemberÂ 16 (29), the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars sent a telegram in reply, greeting the formation of
âtruly popular Soviet rule in the Ukraineâ and promising âthe
new government of the fraternal republic full support in every
way in the struggle for peace and also in the transfer of all land,
factories and banks to the working people of the Ukraineâ.

On December 19, 1917 (January 1, 1918), the C.P.C.
appointed G.Â K. Orjonikidze Acting Commissar Extraordinary of the
Ukraine for co-ordinating the activities of Soviet organisations
functioning in the Ukraine.

Karakhan
 Russian Peace Delegation
 Brest-Litovsk
 Copy to Supreme Commander-in-Chief Krylenko

I received your telegram concerning the report from the
members of the Revolutionary Committee of the 8th Army
âKuzmin and
Reizon.[2] I am passing this telegram on
to the Commander-in-Chief with my advice: not to give
way to the provocation of the Kiev Rada, not to trust it,
and to act in an armed, organised and most resolute way
against the Rumanian counter-revolutionary command,
against the Kaledinites and their accomplices in the Kiev
Rada.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Transmitted by direct line.âEd.
 



[2]
Kuzmin and Reizon reported provocatory acts by the Ukrainian
Central Rada and the counter-revolutionary command of the
Rumanian Front aimed at demoralising and disarming the 8thÂ 
Army.

The Ukrainian Central Radaâa counter-revolutionary
bourgeois-nationalist organisation. After the victory of the October
Revolution it proclaimed itself the supreme organ of the â
Ukrainian Peopleâs Republicâ and began an open struggle against
Soviet power.

At the First All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets held in Kharkov
in December 1917, the Ukraine was proclaimed a Soviet

 Â  

Republic. The Congress declared the power of the Central Rada
overthrown. The Council of Peopleâs Commissars of the R.S.F.S.R.
recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Government as the sole
legitimate government of the Ukraine. In January 1918, Soviet troops
in the Ukraine launched an offensive and on JanuaryÂ 26 (
FebruaryÂ 8) seized Kiev and deposed the bourgeois Rada.

The Central Rada, routed and driven from the territory of
the Soviet Ukraine, and having no support among the working
masses, allied itself with the German imperialists in order to
overthrow Soviet power and restore the bourgeois regime in the
Ukraine. During the peace negotiations between the Soviet
Republic and Germany, the Rada sent its delegation to Brestâ
Litovsk and behind the back of the Soviet delegation concluded a
separate peace with Germany, by which it undertook to supply
Germany with Ukrainian grain, coal and raw materials in return
for military assistance in the struggle against Soviet power. In
March 1918 the Rada returned to Kiev with the Austrian and
German invaders and became their puppet. At the end of April
the interventionists dismissed the Rada, realising that it was
incapable of suppressing the revolutionary movement in the
Ukraine and ensuring delivery of the required food supplies.

Petrograd. After the counter-revolutionary majority of the Constituent
Assembly had refused to recognise the Soviet Government and
its decrees, and had rejected the Declaration of Rights of the
Working and Exploited People proposed by the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee, the Bolshevik group led by Lenin walked
out. Late the same night the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also
walked out. There remained in the hall only the
Constitutional-Democrats, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.

By the decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
of JanuaryÂ 6 (19) the bourgeois Constituent Assembly was

I have just received a report that last night sailors entered
the Mariinskaya hospital and killed Shingaryov and
Kokoshkin. I order you immediately: first, to begin a
rigorous investigation; secondly, to arrest the sailors guilty
of this
murder.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]

A.Â I. Shingaryov and F.Â F. Kokoshkin, former ministers in the
bourgeois Provisional Government, were arrested after the October
Revolution and confined in the Peter and Paul Fortress, whence,
owing to the state of their health, they were transferred to
the Mariinskaya hospital. On the night of JanuaryÂ 6 (19), 1918,
they were killed by sailors, among whom were anarchists and
criminal elements, who broke into the hospital.

On Leninâs instructions, an investigating commission Was
immediately appointed. Those guilty of the murder were
arrested and tried.

  Instruction

Notify the sailors of the Guards Depot (taking signed
statements from them that they have been so informed)
that they are answerable for the lives of the arrested
officers and that they, the sailors, will be deprived of food
rations, arrested and prosecuted.

Take urgent measures:
(1) for sending a well-armed guard
to the building;
(2) for recording as many as possible of
the names of the Guards Depot
sailors.[1]

Lenin
Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to some sailors of the Second Guards Naval Depot,
who illegally arrested three officers. Under the influence of
counter-revolutionary agitation, these sailors defied the laws of the
Soviet Government, went on drinking bouts, and carried out
illegal searches and arrests. They were disarmed and arrested.

 Â  

The other, better, part of the men went to the Southern Front,
where together with the Red Army units they fought heroically
against the interventionists and whiteguards.

The bearers, Comrades Suvorov and Antropov, are
delegates of the Regional Committee of the Urals Soviets.

  Â  

It is necessary to authorise them to adopt the most
revolutionary measures to ensure the movement to Petrograd
of railway trucks with grain from Siberia.

Notes
 
 



[1]
This document and the note to the secretary which follows it
were written by Lenin in connection with a memorandum
received from the Food and Economic Committee of the Territorial
Soviet of Western Siberia and the Urals, which reported that the
Omsk railway was sabotaging the dispatch of food consignments
to the west, as a result of which over a thousand loaded trucks
remained stationary. The committee requested the appointment
of an emergency commission of investigation. This memorandum
was delivered by delegates from Urals factories, who had arrived
with a train-load of grain.

To be given to Schlichter and Nevsky with the request
that they assist with the utmost energy these people, who
make an excellent impression, for only such contingents
(40â60 persons from the locality) are able to save us from
famine.

 Kharkov
 Commander-in-Chief Muralov
 Presidium of the Soviet of Deputies
 Moscow

We have received news of a traffic jam between Orel
and Kursk preventing the passage of trains with coal and
grain. Any hold-up threatens famine and stoppage of
industry. We suspect sabotage by railwaymen in this
locality for there have been several cases of sabotage there.
We urgently ask you to take the most ruthless
revolutionary measures. We ask you to send out a detachment

  Â  

of absolutely reliable persons. Use all means to ensure the
movement of trucks with grain to Petrograd, otherwise
there is a threat of famine. Place several sailors or Red
Guards on each of the locomotives. Remember that it
depends on you to save Petrograd from famine.

Dear Radek,

Trotsky or Kamenev will inform you of my point of
view. I fundamentally and radically disagree with you.
You are falling into the trap which the imperialists of
both groups are setting the Republic of
Soviets.[1]

With best regards,
 Yours,

15. I. 1918

Comrade Podvoisky and Comrade Krylenko

I received the enclosed letter today from the Dutch
comrade Luteraan, a member of the Left âTribunistâ
Party.[2] I made his acquaintance in 1915 in Berne.

Luteraan asks to be given money for his journey and to
be enrolled in Russiaâs Red Guard.

On grounds of principle I would request you to do what
he asks. Perhaps he could be enrolled temporarily among
the Letts or Estonians who speak German, until he has
learnt
Russian.[3]

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin made the following note on the document; âB.Â Luteraan. 
 Oostenburgermiddenstraat 59III, Amsterdam. Holland.ââEd.
 



[2]
The Tribunistsâmembers of the Social-Democratic Party of
Holland whose press organ was the newspaper De Tribune. They
constituted the Left wing of the labour movement in Holland and
during the imperialist world war (1914â18) their stand was, in
the main, internationalist. In 1918 the Tribunists founded the
Communist Party of Holland.





[3]
The same day, in accordance with Leninâs directive, orders were
issued for money to be given to Luteraan to travel to Russia and
join the ranks of the Red Guard.

Urgent. Governmental

Prime Minister Manner
 and Karl Viik
 Helsingfors

Radio transmissions in Swedish and telegrams on behalf
of the unions of Swedish workers in Finland should be
sent to Sweden as frequently and in as great detail as
possible in order to refute the extremely mendacious reports
of the Swedish bourgeois press about the events in

  Â  

Finland.[1] Please let me know whether you are taking all
measures.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the reports in the Swedish bourgeois press
concerning the revolution that had started in Finland.

On January 27 (new style), 1918, the bourgeois government
of Svinhufvud was overthrown and power passed into the hands
of the workers. On JanuaryÂ 29, a Finnish revolutionary
government was set upâthe Council of Peopleâs Representativesâ
which included E.Â Gylling, 0.Â Kuusinen, Y.Â Sirola, A.Â Taimi
and others. But the proletarian revolution was victorious only
in southern Finland. The Svinhufvud government, entrenched
in the north, appealed to the government of imperial Germany
for assistance. Owing to the intervention of the German armed
forces, the workersâ revolution in Finland was crushed on MayÂ 2,
1918, after a bitter civil war which lasted for three months. A
period of white terror set in in Finland and thousands of
revolutionary workers and peasants were executed or tortured to death
in the prisons.

The Russian Socialist Government regrets inability to
participate in the Allied Socialist Conference as being
contrary to the principles of Internationalism. We object
to division of the working class according to Imperialist
grouping. If British Labour agrees to Russian peace aims,
which are already accepted by the Socialist parties of the
Central Powers, such division is still more unwarranted.

This document is the reply to a telegram from Arthur Henderson,
who, on behalf of the British Labour Party, proposed to Lenin

that delegates should be sent from the Bolshevik Party to a

common agreement on the problems of the war.

Use all methods available to you to cancel todayâs
telegram on peace and general demobilisation of the armies
on all fronts. By order of
Lenin.[2]
 

Notes
 

[1]
Transmitted by direct line by Leninâs secretary.âEd.
 



[2]
On JanuaryÂ 28 (February 10), 1918, at the Brest-Litovsk peace
conferenceâcontrary to Leninâs directive that a peace treaty
should be signed if the Germans presented an ultimatum
demanding itâTrotsky declared that the Soviet Government refused
to sign a peace treaty on the terms put forward by Germany,
but that it considered the war at an end and was demobilising
the army. The same day, without informing the Central Committee
of the R.C.P.(B.) and the Council of Peopleâs Commissars,
Trotsky sent to the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief
what was tantamount to a provocative telegram instructing him
to issue an order on the night of the same day ending the state
of war with Germany and her allies and demobilising the
Russian army. The telegram did not mention that the peace
negotiations in Brest had been broken off, the inference from its
text being that the conference had culminated in the conclusion
of peace. In the early morning on JanuaryÂ 29 (FebruaryÂ 11),
Supreme Commander-in-Chief N.Â V. Krylenko, on the basis of
Trotskyâs telegram, issued an order which announced that peace had
been concluded and called for the cessation of military operations
on all fronts and demobilisation of the army. It was in
consequence of Krylenkoâs order that Lenin sent this telegram and
the one following it.

Comrade Kolegayev,

Please help the bearers (the First Russian Society of
Communist Agricultural Workers) with advice and
directives as to how and where to obtain land. Their initiative
is excellent; support it in every
way.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The First Russian Society of Communist Agricultural Workers
was organised early in 1918 on the initiative of workers at the
Obukhov Factory in Petrograd. Lenin greatly assisted in its
organisation. In March 1918, members of the society with their
families went to Kazakhstan, where they settled and were given land
to cultivate. Civil war prevented the development of the
Petrograd workersâ initiative. The communards failed to reap even
their first harvest. Kulaks and White Cossacks attacked the
commune and broke it up.

Petrol shortage threatens to bring the mines to a
standstill; it will be impossible to pump out the water. We
urgently ask you, if there is the slightest military possibility,
to send all petrol to the mines, at the disposal of the
Kharkov Regional Economic Council, 27 Sumskaya.

Give this telegram to Chicherin and request him urgently
to send an inquiry and protest to the Swedish
Ambassador.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The instruction was written by Lenin beneath the text of a
telegram received from the Command of the Baltic Fleet. The
telegram stated: âA Swedish steamer, a cruiser and a
destroyer flying the Swedish naval flag, arrived off the Ãland
Island, landed 15 Swedish marines, and by threatening to use
their arms forced our communications personnel to retreat.â

Lenin simultaneously sent a telegram to the Finnish Peopleâs
Government (see the document that follows).

I request you immediately to obtain information from
Centrobalt regarding the arrival of Swedish cruisers at
Ãland and the landing of troops by the Swedes. Be so kind
as to let me know by telegraph as quickly as possible what
information the Finnish Workersâ Government has about

  Â  

this and what its attitude is to this whole matter and to
the intervention of Swedish armed

Notes
 
 



[1]
The revolutionary Peopleâs Government of Finland sent a protest
to the Swedish Government in connection with the landing of
their troops on the Aland Islands. Sweden shortly withdrew her
troops from the islands. In mid-March 1918, German troops were
landed there and were used by the German Government to fight
against the Finnish revolution.

Can the report really be true that Swedish warships came
to Ãland Island, landed a detachment and forced our men
to retreat? What military measures of defence and
counter-action has Centrobalt taken? What warships has it sent to
Ãland, and when precisely?

Reply immediately. We are extremely concerned. We
refuse to believe that Centrobalt and our revolutionary
fleet have been inactive. I await a reply.

Have received your telegram of

the Soviet troops on their success. I particularly thank you
for the news of the dispatch of 60Â waggons of coal through
Tsaritsyn and earnestly request you to inform us by
telegraph of the numbers of trains with coal and grain and the
precise days and hours of dispatch. It is extremely
important. Send more grain. The letter of Alexeyevâs spy has

it.[2]

This refers to General Alexeyevâs letter to the French Mission
in Kiev, which was intercepted in Novokhopersk. It was published
on February 19, 1918, in Izvestia No.Â 28. In the letter, General
Alexeyev asked the French Mission for assistance in the struggle
against the Soviet state, since his troops were sustaining heavy
defeats and were forced to withdraw from the Don territory. In
describing the situation in the Don and Kuban regions, Alexeyev
had to admit that he had been mistaken in counting on the
Cossacks. âThe ideas of Bolshevism,â he wrote, âhave found
supporters among the broad mass of Cossacks.â

I have received the telegram concerning the appointment

his directives as Peopleâs Secretary of the sovereign
Ukrainian Republic. If disagreement with him arises, settle
it through Skrypnik, Zatonsky, Bosh, in the last resort
wire me, but never gainsay Luganovsky. The rich stores of
the Rumanian Government must be very strictly guarded
so that they can be turned over intact to the Rumanian
people after the overthrow of the Rumanian
counterrevolution.

(2) who precisely (names and addresses) has all these
goods?

2nd, where (by whom, when?) was the order made for

their safeguarding?

Who is responsible for their safekeeping?

Leninâs inquiry was written in connection with the

the Supreme Economic Council. In reply, Rykov informed Lenin
that: =

1) lists had been drawn up of goods in private, military,
railway and other warehouses; =

2) responsibility for guarding
the stores lay with the organisations to which they belonged;
goods were released from the warehouses on delivery orders
issued by the appropriate central bodies (Central Committee of
Textile Industry, Central Soap Board, etc.); =

3) rationing and
distribution by ration cards was being carried out by the town
Food Committee through co-operative shops and private firms; =

4) there was very little of confiscated products.

I have no new verified information apart from the report
that the Germans, generally speaking, are steadily
advancing because they do not encounter resistance. I consider
the situation extremely grave and the slightest delay on
our part is impermissible. As regards the report about
Austria-Hungary not taking part in the war, I personally,
unlike Trotsky, do not consider it verified; they say the
radio has been intercepted and there were telegrams about
this from Stockholm, but 1 have not seen such documents,

Please include my vote in favour of getting potatoes
and arms from the bandits of Anglo-French
imperialism.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Party Central Committee, at its meeting on February 22,
1918, discussed the question of procuring from Britain and France
arms and food necessary for the defence of the Soviet Republic
against the advancing German troops. This was opposed by
the âLeft Communistsâ, who regarded any agreement with the
imperialists as impermissible in principle.

Lenin could not attend the meeting and therefore sent his
opinion to the Central Committee.

The Party Central Committee adopted a resolution
recognising the need to use every means to arm and equip the Red Army,
including that of obtaining armaments and equipment from
governments of capitalist countries, while at the same time
pursuing a fully independent foreign policy. On the same day a
sitting of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars also passed a decision
in favour of obtaining arms and food supplies from Britain and
France (see also present edition, Vol.Â 27, pp. 36â39).

Chicherin, Joffe, Karakhan, Sokolnikov
 Novoselye Railway Station
 Peace Delegation

We do not quite understand your telegram. If you are
wavering, it is
impermissible.[1] Send envoys and try to
reach the Germans quickly.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On FebruaryÂ 25, the Soviet delegation, which had left for
Brest-Litovsk to sign the peace treaty, was delayed at Novoselye
railway station, where a bridge had been blown up. Unable to get
in touch directly with the German Government, the delegation
wired the Council of Peopleâs Commissars requesting that the
German Government be informed of the arrival of the delegation.
Leninâs remark about possible waverings on the part of the
delegation was apparently due to the fact that two of its members,
G.Â Y. Sokolnikov and A.Â A. Joffe, had been refusing to join it,
and had only set out after a decision of the Central Committee
of the R.C.P.(B.).

Peace has not yet been signed, but a delegation has
gone to Brest-Litovsk to sign the peace terms accepted
by the C.E.C. and the C.P.C. Your resolution received. The
German whiteguards and composite units of their regular
army have joined with our whiteguards and are advancing
on Petrograd with brazen audacity. A movement of large
German forces in the wake of the advance detachments
has been reported. Most of our troops are in
flight.[1]

The
socialist fatherland is in danger. Dvinsk, Reval, Venden,
Volmar, Minsk, Pskov have been taken. Our morale is
good. Masses of workers have sprung to the defence of the
Soviet Republic. The C.C. of the Bolsheviks is in favour
of signing peace. The C.C. of the Left Socialistâ
Revolutionaries[2] is in favour of a holy war.

As for gold, we recommend that the workers at the mines
be paid at cost prices. There has been no special decree
by the C.P.C. on gold.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
The two preceding sentences are in Leninâs hand.âEd.
 



[2]
The Left Socialist-Revolutionariesâthe Left wing of the
petty-bourgeois Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which was organised as
an independent party in November 1917.

In an effort to maintain their influence among the peasants,
the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries entered into an agreement with
the Bolsheviks. They pledged themselves to carry out the general
policy of the Soviet Government and were given posts in the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars and on the boards of several Peopleâs
Commissariats.

But differences with the Bolsheviks on basic issues of the
theory and practice of socialist construction soon made themselves
felt. In January and February 1918, the Central Committee of
the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party began a campaign against
the conclusion of the Brest Peace Treaty with Germany. When
the treaty had been signed and ratified by the Fourth Congress
of Soviets in March 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
withdrew from the Council of Peopleâs Commissars. In July 1918 the
Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries organised
the provocative assassination of Mirbach, the German Ambassador
in Moscow, and launched an armed revolt against Soviet power.
Having lost all support among the masses, the Left Socialistâ
Revolutionary Party finally took the path of armed struggle
against Soviet rule.

4/III (19/11). 1918

Comrade Dzerzhinsky,

The bearer, Sidorenko, was my personal secretary for
some days. I was quite satisfied with him. He was
dismissed on account of an incident when, being drunk, he
shouted, as I have been informed, that he was âLeninâs
secretaryâ.

Sidorenko tells me that he deeply regrets it. And
personally I am inclined to believe him; the lad is young
and, in my opinion, very good. One must be lenient to
youth.

On the basis of all these facts, judge for yourself, and
see what place you can find for him.

Yours,
 Lenin

Maria Fyodorovna,

Unfortunately, my colleagues (in the Council) consider
it impossible for me to permit a meeting (bypassing the
investigating commission), all the more so since medical
aid (in case of illness) is available.

I cannot go against the will and decision of my Council
colleagues.

Just now it is absolutely impossible for me to have a
talk with you, as I cannot tear myself away. I will
write you about the case of the âprovocateur and

  Â  

blackmailerâ (obviously he was a
blackmailer: Kartashov has
long been in prison, I have made inquiries).

I beg you to excuse me.

All the best,
 Lenin

Comrade Sergo,

I beg you to pay serious attention to the Crimea and
the Donets Basin with a view to creating a united fighting
front against invasion from the West. Impress upon the
Crimean comrades that the course of events makes defence
imperative for them and that they must defend themselves
irrespective of ratification of the peace treaty. Make them
realise that the position of the north is substantially
different from that of the south, and in view of the war, the
actual war of the Germans against the Ukraine, help on the
part of the Crimea, which (the Crimea) the Germans can
gobble up in passing, is not only an act of neighbourly
duty, but a requirement for self-defence and selfâ
preservation. It is possible that Slutsky, failing to grasp the
complexity of the present situation, has taken some other,
simplified line of his ownâin which case he must be put
in his place in my name. Immediate evacuation of grain
and metals to the east, organisation of demolition groups,
the creation of a united front of defence from the Crimea
to Great Russia, drawing in the peasants, a decisive and
unqualified transformation Ukrainian-wise of our units in
the Ukraineâthese are the present tasks. Antonov should
be forbidden to call himself Antonov-Ovseyenkoâhe must
call himself simply Ovseyenko. The same applies to
Muravyov (if he remains in his post) and others.
As regards the Donets Republic, tell Comrades

  Â  

Vasilchenko, Zhakov and others that however much they may
contrive to keep their region apart from the Ukraine,
itâjudging from the geography of Vinnichenkoâwill all the
same he included in the Ukraine and the Germans will
proceed to conquer it. In view of this, it is quite absurd
for the Donets Republic to refuse a united defence front
with the rest of the Ukraine. Mezhlauk was in Petrograd
and he agreed to recognise the Donets Basin as an
autonomous part of the Ukraine; Artyom has also agreed to this;
therefore the obstinacy of some comrades from the Donets
Basin takes on the appearance of an entirely inexplicable
and harmful whim which is absolutely impermissible in
our Party midst.

Bring this home to the comrades of the Crimea and
Donbas, Comrade Sergo, and get a united defence front set up.

Lenin
14 (1).III.1918

As regards money, arrange to issue what is essential for
defence, but be extremely cautious; give it only into the
most reliable hands and under the strictest control, as
there are lots of people these days who are eager to grab
or to throw money
away.[1]

Governmental

 Report receipt

28. III. 1918

Sovnarkom of the Petrograd Labour Commune
 Smolny, Petrograd
 Copies to Shlyapnikov, Chairman of the Evacuation
  Commission, and to Gorbunov, Secretary of the C.P.C.

I have received Gorbunovâs memorandum. I strongly
protest against the delay in the evacuation of
industry.[2]
Larin and Milyutin have no right to alter the decision.
If anyone is dissatisfied with my order, let him complain
to the C.P.C. or C.E.C., but until my order is cancelled
its fulfilment is obligatory. I am particularly indignant at
the milliardsâ worth of stores on Gutuyev Island being left
untouched. That is disgraceful. The evacuation of these stores
must be begun at all costs and carried out in the speediest
manner.[3] The Sovnarkom to send in twice weekly precise
reports on what has actually been done for the evacuation
and how many truck-loads have been evacuated.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Sovnarkom (Council of Peopleâs Commissars) of the Petrograd
Labour Commune was set up by a decision of the Petrograd Soviet
of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies on March 11, 1918, owing to
the Soviet Government being transferred from Petrograd to
Moscow.

At the end of April 1918, the Congress of Soviets of the
Northern Region established, for military and economic purposes,
a Union of Communes of the Northern Region, which included
also Petrograd Gubernia. On February 24, 1919, by a decision
of the Third Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region, the Union
of Communes of the Northern Region and the Sovnarkom which
headed it, were abolished.





[2]
This refers to the evacuation of industrial enterprises from
Petrograd. The question was raised in connection with the advance
of the German troops on Petrograd.





[3]
The city Customs House was on Gutuyev Island in Petrograd.
During AprilâJune 1918, 1,180 truck-loads of various goods were
evacuated from the Gutuyev Customs House.

There are evidently persons sitting here who have been

They need not be sent away.

But I reprimand you and the other secretaries; you have

Kuibyshev, Chairman of the Soviet of Deputies, on the line in Samara


Comrade Lenin, Dutovâs forces have again become active in
Orenburg; a report has been received that Cossack detachments are
advancing within twenty versts of Orenburg. Iletsk is encircled by Cossacks.
The Cossacks arc mobilising all the villages; they are committing
terrible atrocities, three members of the Executive Committee, and
Zakharov, Chairman of the Cossack Section of the Soviet,, have been
killed. The bourgeoisie of Orenburg is actively participating.
Orenburg requests the Council of Peopleâs Commissars to help uproot this
Dutov adventure, otherwise there will again be a blockage, which
will cause the death through famine of 12,000,000 inhabitants of
Turkestan. One detachment sent from Orenburg to Iletsk was surrounded
and wiped out to a man; government commissar Tsvilling is believed
to have been killed. Samara will strain all efforts to help Orenburg,
but the local forces are insufficient to liquidate Dutovâs bands
completely; help from the centre is essential. I have finished and await
a reply.

I shall take all steps immediately to notify the military
authorities and give you assistance.

I fully approve the resolution of
Centrosibir.[1] I advise
you to prepare stores of foodstuffs and other products even
if by requisitioning, in order to build up a serious defence.
Our talks with the ambassadors should begin
today.[2] It is
clear now that no trust can be put in assurances and the
only serious guarantee lies in solid military preparations
on our part.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a resolution passed by the Central Executive
Committee of Siberian Soviets in connection with the landing of
Japanese troops in Vladivostok on the morning of April 5, 1918. It
protested against the illegitimate actions of the Japanese
Government; a state of war was declared in Siberia and all local
Soviets were instructed to immediately step up the organisation
of the Red Army.

Centrosibirâthe Central Executive Committee of Siberian
Soviets; was elected by the First Congress of Siberian Soviets,
held in Irkutsk from OctoberÂ 16 (29) to OctoberÂ 24 (NovemberÂ 6),
1917. After the temporary downfall of Soviet power in Siberia
(in the summer of 1918) Centrosibir ceased its activity.





[2]
This refers to the Soviet Governmentâs talks with representatives
of the U.S.A., Britain and France in connection with the landing
of Japanese troops in Vladivostok; the talks took place on the
evening of AprilÂ 5, 1918.

The Soviet Governmentâs communique on the landing of
Japanese troops in Vladivostok, written on April 5 and published in
Pravda and Izvestia on April 6, 1918, pointed out that resistance
to the Japanese invasion and a relentless struggle against their
agents and accomplices within the country was a matter of life
and death for the Soviet Republic, for the working people of the
whole of Russia. On AprilÂ 7, 1918, Lenin sent a telegram with
directives to the Vladivostok Soviet, warning that the
interventionists were sure to advance and demanding that the
Communists of the Far East without delay should start preparing
to fight the foreign intervention (see present edition, Vol.Â 27,
p.Â 226).

in the Commissariat for Agriculture and his possible
participation in it.

Comrade Bogolepov
 (Deputy Commissar for Finance)
 Comrade Tsyurupa
 (or Comrade Bryukhanov)

The bearers of this note, representatives of the Pskov
Gubernia Soviet, have so far been unable to obtain the
food and financial assistance they are so badly in need of.
The situation in Pskov Gubernia (especially owing to the
German invasion; about one-ninth of the gubernia has been
occupied) is desperate. I ask you most earnestly to consider
what extraordinary measures you can adopt to help them,
and to telephone me to talk it over.

I request the members of the Board of the Commissariat
for Justice (preferably all of them) to visit me (we can agree
on the day and time) for a talk about the following:

1) what precisely has been done for publishing a
Collection of Laws and Decrees.
 

2)âfor codification,Â 

3)âfor ensuring speedier and more ruthless court action
against the bourgeoisie, embezzlers of state properly, etc.,Â 

4)âfor juridical propaganda among the population, among
the workers and poor peasants


(a) in printed form;


(b) by lectures (or classes, and so on),Â 

5)âfor drawing the poor into the work of court
proceedings (jurors) and investigation,Â 

6)âfor using Shreiderâs personnel and others.

Comrade Dyrenkovâs account of the measures taken by
him in Rybinsk to tighten work discipline and of the
support for them on the part of the workers has shown me that
the Rybinsk comrades are correctly tackling the most
important and most urgent tasks of the day, and I ask the
representatives of Soviet power and workersâ organisations
in the city of Rybinsk to accept my wishes for still more
energetic efforts and the achievement of the greatest
successes in this field.

Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this message on the instructions which engineer
N.Â I. Dyrenkov, business manager of the Rybinsk Economic
Council, received from the Supreme Economic Council.

Dyrenkov came to Moscow to report to the Supreme
Economic Council on the work of the Rybinsk Economic Council. This
report on the economic situation in Rybinsk was made at a sitting
of the Board of the Supreme Economic Council on AprilÂ 15,
1913; on a proposal by Lenin, it was decided to grant an immediate
loan to Rybinsk. Lenin had a talk with Dyrenkov on the
economic situation of the Soviet Republic, the state of industry in
Rybinsk and the measure taken by the Rybinsk Economic Council.

Comrades Bogolepov and Gukovsky

I send you the draft of a law on shares. I want you
urgently and without fail toÂ 

1) discuss it,Â 

2) make your corrections,Â 

3) immediately invite to the discussion specialists known
to you (ask them for their opinionâpreferably in writing);
from the professors you can order a commentary,Â 

4) all this needs to be completed by tomorrow, for
tomorrow, 17.Â IV, we have to endorse the decree in the
C.P.C.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the draft Decree on the Registration of Shares,

 Â  

Bonds and Other Interest-bearing Securities. The first two drafts
were prepared by the Supreme Economic Council. After
examining them, Lenin crossed out the first draft, edited the second,
and sent it to Bogolepov and Gukovsky at the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Finance. The draft, after being revised in the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Finance, was re-edited by Lenin, given a
heading and, on April 17, 1918, submitted for consideration to the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars. The following decision on the
draft was adopted: âTo be referred to the Peopleâs Commissariats
for Foreign Affairs and Justice for their consideration with the
assistance of experts, and the conclusion to be presented to the
next sitting of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on AprilÂ 18.â
On April 18, the decree was endorsed by the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars, and on April 20 it was published in Izvestia No.Â 78.

Chairman of the Soviet
 Simbirsk

Inform me by telegram of the circumstances and
conditions of election of heads of Chuvash teachersâ seminaries
for men and women. I am interested in the fate of
Inspector Ivan Yakovlevich Yakovlev, who has worked for fifty
years for the advance of the Chuvash people and suffered
persecution from tsarism. I think Yakovlev should not be
torn away from his lifeâs
work.[2]

Notes
 

[1]
At the top of the document Lenin wrote: âPlease send the bill 
 for this telegram to me personally.ââEd.
 



[2]

I.Â Y. Yakovlev established the first Chuvash school in the city of
Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk), the birthplace of Lenin. He compiled
the first Chuvash alphabet and primer, and did a great deal
towards educating the Chuvash people.

In reply to his inquiry Lenin received a telegram on May 4,
1918, saying that Yakovlev continued as chairman of the courses
and seminary for women.

21. IV. 1918

The Narrow Council

In the affair concerning the reorganisation of the Red
Cross, which has become known to me through V.Â M.
Bonch-Bruyevich, I strongly advise:

1) that written explanations be demandedÂ 

(a) from all members of the committee


(Â§Â 3, sectionÂ I),

(b) from all departments, which should have sent
representativesâ
 

âexplanations as to when the committee met, where its
minutes are, etc.

It is necessary not only to admonish, but to prosecute
a number of persons (they must be found) for non-fulfilment
of the decree.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs letter was due to the following circumstance. On
JanuaryÂ 4 (17), 1918, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars adopted a
decree on the reorganisation of the Red Cross on the basis of the
abolished Chief Board of the Red Cross that had existed under
the tsarist government, making over its property and funds to
the state. The work of reorganising the Red Cross was entrusted
(Â§Â 3 of SectionÂ 1 of the decree) to a committee of representatives
of Soviet, military and public organisations. The committee was
instructed to submit to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
through the Council of Medical Collegiums a plan for reorganising
the Red Cross institutions. However, the committee failed to
fulfil the tasks entrusted to it, and this was brought to the notice
of Lenin by V.Â M. Bonch-Bruyevich, a member of the Red Cross
committee.

Vinogradov, Gubernia Executive Committee

Peopleâs Commissar Tsyurupa has shown me your
telegram to him of 21.Â IV. No.Â 1192, in which you refer to an
order of the central Soviet authorities as being absurd.

I officially reprimand you for this and state that if you
do not withdraw such an impermissible expression, I shall
raise the question of your being brought before the court,
for if we are conscientious in teaching discipline to
workers and peasants, we are obliged to begin with ourselves.

Push hard in the Supreme Economic Council for a
discussion on replacing the old paper currency by new;
Gukovsky jibs at it, but I think it should be pushed
forward.[1]

Your opinion?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to preparations for a monetary reform in order to
establish a stable Soviet currency and overcome the inflation caused
by the war and the economic policy of the tsarist government
and the bourgeois Provisional Government. Lenin raised the
question of the need for a monetary reform in December 1917 in
his âDraft Decree on the Nationalisation of the Banks and on
Measures Necessary for Its Implementationâ (see present edition,
Vol.Â 26, p.Â 403). Preparations for the monetary reform wore made
under the direct guidance of Lenin. He urged more speed in
preparing and issuing new, Soviet currency notes, and went into
all details of the proposed designs. (See this volume, documents
125 and 126, and also Lenin Miscellany XXI, p.Â 180.)

Owing to the foreign military intervention and the Civil War,
and the transition to the policy of War Communism, the

 Â  

monetary reform was not carried out in that period. The first Soviet
monetary reform on the basis of Leninâs principles was effected
in 1922â24.

Dear Mr.Â Robins,

I thank you very much for your letter. I am sure the

coming in all countries and will crush all obstacles and the
imperialist-capitalist system in the new and the old world,

With kindly regards and thanks,

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter is a reply to Raymond Robins, a member of the
American Red Cross Mission. It was written in English. At the head
of the letter, Lenin wrote: âReply 30.IV. 1918.â

On the eve of his departure from Soviet Russia for the United
States, R.Â Robins wrote to Lenin expressing sincere thanks for the
assistance given him in his work for the American Red Cross
Mission.

A few days later, on May 11, 1918, Lenin wrote a letter
addressed âTo All Soviets of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies and
Other Soviet Organisationsâ, requesting them âto give every
assistance to Colonel Robins and the other members of the
American Red Cross Mission for their unhindered and speedy journey
from Moscow to Vladivostokâ.

Comrade Tsyurupa

Sapronov from the Moscow Gubernia Soviet describes the
catastrophic food situation in Moscow Gubernia and insists
on the need to increase, the delivery orders for grain. At
least a minimum quota should be fixed. The amount given
to the peasants must be increased, otherwise they will eat
up all the seed and wonât sow.

What can be done? What has been done?

Lenin

Why is it that, contrary to the decision of the C.P.C.
and in spite of unemployment (and in spite of May Day),Â 

work has not been begun in MoscowÂ 
 

1) on a proper removal of tsarist monuments?

2) on the removal of tsarist eagles?

3) on preparing hundreds of inscriptions (revolutionary
and socialist) on all public buildings?

4) on setting up busts (if only temporary ones) of
various great revolutionaries?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter to P.Â P. Malinovsky, Acting Peopleâs
Commissar for the Properties of the Republic, in connection with
the implementation of the decree of the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars âOn the Monuments of the Republicâ, adopted on April
12, 1918, =

and published on April 14 in Pravda and Izvestia. The
decree set the task of removing monuments to the tsars and their
servants that were of no historical or artistic value, and of
erecting revolutionary monuments. A special commission, consisting
of the Peopleâs Commissar for Education, the Peopleâs Commissar
for the Properties of the Republic and the head of the Fine Arts
Department of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education, was
instructed to determine which monuments in Moscow and
Petrograd were to be removed, and advised to enlist the services of
artists in designing new, revolutionary monuments. The Council
of Peopleâs Commissars proposed that by May 1 the commission
should have removed the ugliest monuments and submitted the
first models of new monuments, and should also hasten
arrangements for replacing old inscriptions, emblems and street names
by new ones reflecting the ideas and sentiments of revolutionary
Russia.

Lenin attached great importance to the implementation of
this decree, the progress of which was discussed at the sittings
of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on July 8, 17 and 30, 1918.
Lenin repeatedly criticised the heads of the Peopleâs
Commissariats for Education and for the Properties of the Republic, and
the heads of the Moscow Soviet, for the unsatisfactory
implementation of the decree (see this volume, Document 109, and present
edition, Vol.Â 35, documents 171 and 176, pp. 360, 368).

Andronnikov
 Regional Board
 Ekaterinburg

Rumours about the denationalisation of the Bogoslovsk
district are stupid
nonsense.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram is in reply to one from Ekaterinburg dated April
30, 1918, from the Regional Board of Nationalised Enterprises,
reporting that rumours were current about the denationalisation
of the Bogoslovsk mining district. Lenin attached great
importance to the speedy exposure of these false rumours which could

 Â  

mislead the working masses. On the telegram from Ekaterinburg,
Lenin wrote the following note: âReceived 2/V.1918 at 7 p.m.
I demand investigation into the reason for two daysâ delay.
Lenin.â

1) The proposal of Comrades Spiridonova and Karelin
is that the Bolsheviks should surrender to the Left S.R.s
absolute control of the Commissariat for Agriculture, with
the Bolsheviks retaining only political representation.
 

2) The grounds for this proposal are that, in the opinion
of Comrades Spiridonova and Karelin, the Commissariat
for Agriculture is going to pieces, work is becoming
impossible for the Left S.R.s, they will all be compelled to
leave, becauseâit is allegedâthey are being âoustedâ, etc.

3) The meeting (of Lenin with the Bolsheviks from the
Agriculture Board) refers the question raised by the S.R.s
to the C.C. of the Party for decision. For its part, the
meeting considers the arguments of the S.R.s groundless and
their proposal
unacceptable.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The text of pointÂ 3 is in the handwriting of V.Â N.
Meshcheryakov. The document is signed by V.Â N. Meshcheryakov, S.Â P. Sereda,
and N.Â M. Petrovsky.âEd.
 



[2]
This memorandum was adopted at a meeting of Lenin and
Bolshevik members of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Agriculture in connection with the demand of Maria Spiridonova
and V.Â A. Karelin, leaders of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,
that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries be given complete control
of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Agriculture. This demand
was put forward because of the appointment of more Bolsheviks
(S.Â P. Sereda, V.Â N. Meshcheryakov, N.Â M. Petrovsky and others)
to the Commissariat for Agriculture following the resignation
of A.Â L. Kolegayev, as a result of which the position of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries in the Commissariat was considerably
weakened.

Lenin wrote also the following draft decision of the meeting:
âThe preliminary meeting (on the questions raised by Comrades
Spiridonova and Karelin) between members of the Board of
Agriculture, Comrades Sereda and Meshcheryakov, and Lenin has
reached the conclusion that the questions raised should be
examined 33 serious political questions and therefore should certainly
be referred to the C.C., R.C.P.

âThe meeting considers it essential to refer them to the C.C.
urgently and speedilyâ (Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p.Â 42).

The situation in the Peopleâs Commissariat for Agriculture
was discussed at a sitting of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on MayÂ 3, 1918.
The Central Committee noted that the claims of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries were groundless and approved the decision
of the meeting.

In the Ukraine there has been a coup
dâÃ©tat.[1]

Bourgeois-landowner rule completely restored.

Rostov-on-Don taken by the
Germans.[2]

British threaten with a British and Japanese offensive.

Germans demand the seizure of Ino by the Finns and the
Murmansk railway to fight the
British.[3]

We are holding emergency meeting of C.C. of the Party
on all
this.[4]

Your policy is to exert all efforts to hasten the
conclusion of an armistice and peace, at the price, of course, of
new annexations.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the dismissal of the Central Rada by the German
occupationists and the establishment in the Ukraine of an open
dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and landowners. On AprilÂ 29,
1918, at a congress of kulaks and landowners in Kiev convened
by the interventionists, General P.Â P. Skoropadsky, a big
Ukrainian landowner and former aide-de-camp to the Tsar, was
proclaimed Hetman of the Ukraine.





[2]
On MayÂ 6, 1918, German and whiteguard army units broke into
Rostov-on-Don and occupied the city. On MayÂ 7, it was liberated
by Soviet troops, but on MayÂ 8 it was re-occupied by German
and whiteguard troops.





[3]
Inoâa fort on the border with Finland which, with Kronstadt,
guarded the approaches to Petrograd. Under a treaty between the
R.S.F.S.R. and the Finnish Socialist Workersâ Republic, Fort
Ino was seceded to the R.S.F.S.R. for the defence of the joint
interests of the Socialist Republics. After the defeat of the
revolution in Finland, the Finnish bourgeois government with the
support of the German imperialists demanded that Fort Ino be
handed over to Finland. Before it was abandoned, the main works

 Â  

of the fort were blown up by order of the Commandant of the
Kronstadt fortress. In May 1918, Finnish troops occupied
Fort Ino.





[4]
An emergency meeting of the Party Central Committee on May 6,
1918, discussed the international situation of the Soviet Republic
in connection with the aggravation of relations with Germany,
who demanded that Fort Ino be handed over to bourgeois Finland,
and also in connection with the British occupation of Murmansk
and the preparations by the interventionist troops to advance
into the interior of the country. The Central Committee adopted
the decision on the international situation proposed by Lenin
(see present edition, Vol.Â 27, pp. 355 and 379â80).

This note is a reply to A.Â D. Tsyurupa, who had informed Lenin
that the food organisation of the Nikolayevskaya Railway had
refused to allow A.Â I. Svidersky, member of the Board of the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, to carry out an inspection agreed
upon between the Food Commissariat, the Commissariat for

I state that I have not received a reply to my telegram

I state that such an attitude
to the matter, when no reply is given as to what use has
been made of hundreds of millions, and why an extra sum
above the quota is needed and how much, is impermissible.

Comrade Tsyurupa,
 Peopleâs Commissar for Food

The bearerâAndrei Vasilievich Ivanovâis a Putilov
factory worker (who is well known to Shlyapnikov and has
old Party certificates dating from tsarist times).

I told him about yesterdayâs decree and the decision
that the Commissariat for Labour was to urgently mobilise
workers. I gave him my opinion as follows:

Unless the best workers of Petrograd build by selection
a reliable workersâ army of 20,000 people for a disciplined
and ruthless military crusade against the rural bourgeoisie
and against bribe-takers, famine and the ruin of the
revolution are inevitable.

Please confirm this to the bearer and give him a brief
statement that you will grant such detachments the fullest
plenary powers on precisely such conditions.

Please give him such a statement to be read in Petrograd,
and return this letter to the bearer.

Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter after a talk with the Chairman of the
Purchasing Commission of the Putilov (now Kirov) Works, a plater
in the boiler-shop, A.Â V. Ivanov, who gave a detailed
description of the grave state of famine in Petrograd and told of the
situation at the works and the mood of the workers.

Lenin informed Ivanov of the decree passed at the meeting
of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on May 9, 1918, giving
the Peopleâs Commissar for Food emergency powers in the
struggle against the rural bourgeoisie, who were concealing grain and
profiteering. Lenin gave Ivanov a copy of the decree so that he
could make it known to the Putilov workers.

The meeting between A.Â V. Ivanov and Lenin is described
in the book Vospominaniya o Vladimire Ilyiche Lenine (
Reminiscences of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin), PartÂ 2, 1957, pp. 283â84.

Comrade Bronsky,

And so, it is precisely agreed between us thatÂ 

(1) at tomorrowâs meeting with the Germans you will be
the first to speak (none of the Russians before
you),[1]

(2) you will first read the theses (afterwards make a
speech, or a report, or a commentary),

(3) you will show me the theses tomorrow before the
meeting (i.e., in the morning before 2Â oâclock; I shall be leaving
after that).
 

This is extremely important. It is a directive of the C.C.
and the C.P.C. It is obligatory!

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a meeting of the Russo-German Commission held
in Moscow on May 15, 1918, to discuss the conditions for resuming
economic relations between Russia and Germany. The report at
the meeting was made by M.Â G. Bronsky, Deputy Peopleâs
Commissar for Trade and Industry. The main propositions in his
report had been vetted by Lenin.

To Colonel Robins

Dear Mr.Â Robins,

I enclose the preliminary plan of our economic relations
with America. This preliminary plan was elaborated in the
Council of Export Trade in our highest Council of National
Economy.[1]

I hope this preliminary can he useful for you in your
conversation with the American Foreign Office and
American Export Specialists.

With best thanks,
 Yours truly,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a plan for the development of trade and economic relations
with the U.S.A. drafted on Leninâs initiative, the Soviet
Government expressed its readiness to pay for goods purchased in the
U.S.A. with agricultural produce and products of the mining
industry, and also to offer concessions to the U.S.A. on the same
terms as to other countries.

The plan, under the heading âRusso-American Trade
Relationsâ, was first published in June 1918 in No.Â 1 of Vestnik 
 Â  

Narodnogo Komissartata torgovli i promysklennosti (Herald of the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Trade and Industry). In the U.S.A., the
plan was published together with Leninâs letter to Raymond
Robins in the book Russian-American Relations. March 1917â
March 1920, New York, 1920.

MayÂ 16, 1918

Chairman of the Supreme Military Council

The Supreme Military Council is directed to send envoysâ
through the appropriate military authorities at the front

  Â  

âfor the purpose of signing a truce and establishing a
demarcation line on the South-Eastern (Don) Front. In
order that appropriate instructions may be given to the
military authorities, we inform you that our envoys are in
Kharkov at the present moment, headed by Sytin, military
commander of the Bryansk General Staff units, who has
been given instructions to secure a general truce on the
Voronezh and South-Eastern fronts. A truce, especially on
the South-Eastern (Don) Front, must be secured as quickly
as possible, in the last resort agreeing even to accepting
as a basis the present disposition of military forces.

Sytin has been instructed to try to secure through the
medium of the German Command direct contact with our
Command on the South-Eastern Front for co-ordinated
action.

With the same aim in view, the Supreme Military Council,
by all the means available to it, should maintain constant
contact both with Sytin and with our Command on the
South-Eastern Front.

Chicherin:

In my opinion, the Brest treaty cannot forbid us to
combat, pirate-insurgents (armed merchant vessels),
||


and it is
necessary to find a form for our naval forces to give an
armed rebuff to the rebels.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note to G.Â V. Chicherin was written following the receipt
of a report that troops of the Transcaucasian bourgeois
government, supported by a flotilla of armed merchant vessels, were
advancing on Sukhum, creating a threat to the entire Black Sea
coast. In the draft of a telegram submitted to Lenin, which was
addressed to Sablin, Chief of the Naval Forces of the Black Sea
Fleet, the latter was instructed to arm a number of Soviet merchant
ships and send them for the defence of Sukhum.

On May 20, 1918, the Soviet Government sent a Note to the
German Government protesting against the German military
authorities conniving at the actions of the armed merchant ships
of âthe so-called Transcaucasian government, which is
recognised by absolutely nobody in Transcaucasiaâ.

   TO A.Â D. TSYURUPA

1) Has your draft (on the organisation of supply
commissariats) been communicated to all departments?

2) Take the floor today on a point of order about
submitting it for discussion tomorrow.

3) Is there not too much bureaucratic formality in your
draft? Should not a point be inserted in the decree
providing for the participation of 20â50 workers
(with very strict
recommendations) in each of the supply commissariats in
the grain-producing
gubernias?[1]
A.Â D. TSYURUPAâS REPLY


1) The draft has been discussed with regional officials, and
approved by Rykov and the Supreme Economic Council in the section
concerning the establishment of a Commissariat for Supply (
central).


2) I will rise to a point of order.


3) The draft provides for the setting up of supply commissariats
under the Soviets; the supply commissariats must not be unwieldy.
A point about the participation of 20â50 workers in each
commissariat of the grain-producing gubernias may be inserted, but it should
be for their participation in the technical apparatus as cadres to be
sent out to the volosts.


The introduction of such a number of workers in the composition
of the commissariats will evoke protests in the local areas.
TO A.Â D. TSYURUPA

Not in the composition of the commissariats, of course,
but as cadres ofÂ 

1) agitators

2) controllers

3) executors.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a draft decree for reorganising the Food
Commissariat, and the local food bodies. At a meeting of the C.P.C. on
May 20, 1918, A.Â D. Tsyurupa, on Leninâs instructions, moved
that the draft decree be submitted for discussion. The draft was
discussed at meetings of the C.P.C. on MayÂ 22 and 23, and was
adopted with amendments. It was decided to refer the decree
to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, where it was
endorsed on May 27. It was published in Izvestia No,Â 109 on May
31, 1918.

ClauseÂ 3 of the decree envisaged the establishment under the
local food commissariats of special detachments of workers
recommended by Party and trade union organisations, formed mainly
in the consuming districts. These detachments were to be at the
disposal of the local food bodies and comply with their directives,
and were to be employed in propaganda, organising and
instructorsâ work. âThe most important task of the workersâ
detachments,â states the decree, âshould be to organise the working
peasantry against the kulaksâ (Dekrety Sovetskoi vlasti [Decrees
of the Soviet Government], Vol.Â II, 1959, p. 310).

A Food Commissariat circularâor better still, perhaps,
a decree of the C.P.C.âshould be drawn up, making it
amply clear:

âthat the
delegatkoms[1]

should be allowed to work
jointly with the gubernia food committees and under
their control;

âthat the separate existence and separate operation of
the delegatkoms is impermissible;

âthat such a thing invariably leads to the infiltration
of profiteers;

âthat especially desirable is the assistance of the
delegatkoms and their participation in agitation against
the kulaks and profiteers under the guidance of
agitatorsâ detachments of the gubernia food committees,
etc.

All this should be set out and published in greatest detail
and in an extremely popular manner.

24/V.1918

Comrades Joffe and Menzhinsky

Dear Comrades,

I have received your pessimistic and angry letters (that
of 20.Â V, I received today, 24.Â V). Some of your accusations
levelled against Chicherin fall on me. For example, I
insisted that the theses on concessions should be sent through
  Â  

the Germans, in order to show them how seriously we
desire business-like economic relations. (The theses were drawn
up by common consent with the participation of Radek
and other âLeft stupidsâ.) The terms of our concessions
are such that nothing but benefit for us will result if the
Germans accept these terms.

I fully approve your policy, set out in especial detail
in Comrade Joffeâs letters.

Your dissatisfaction with Chicherin is, in my opinion,
exaggerated. But in any case I agree to help you and I ask
you to direct your efforts to practical ways of improving
matters. For this, I would suggest that you precisely
formulate concrete proposals (send me copies of telegrams and
letters, parts that are
strictly practical and brief, for I
simply have no time to read everything). In that case I
promise to try to secure their fulfilment and to check whether
they have been fulfilled.

You must think over how to shift the centre of things
to Berlin to a greater extent (I agree to help in this), and
propose for this purpose very tactful (N.B.) and concretely
practical measures. I shall accept all feasible measures and
endeavour to have them carried out.

If anything can be done to secure peace with Finland,
the Ukraine and Turkey (this is the crux of the matter), we
must always work for this (of course, it cannot be secured
without certain further annexations and tribute payments).
I would give much to hasten such a peace.

You, too, should keep your nerve. Putting diplomacy to
rights (and creating a new diplomacy) is no easy task.
Festina lente.

With best greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S.

28/V. I missed the messenger.

Chicherin has given me the text of a Note which Joffe
sent to the German Government on his own account, agreeing
to surrender the ships of the Black Sea Fleet (i.e., to their
removal from Novorossiisk to
Sevastopol)[1] on condition

  Â  

merely of peace with, the Ukraine. However, our
government in a clearly worded Note (communicated by radio
to Joffe as well) considered it possible to agree to the
removal of the ships to Sevastopol on different conditions,
viz.:
1) peace on all three fronts, i.e., with the Ukraine and
Finland and Turkey;
2) no annexation of Sevastopol.

How could Joffe make such a mistake? How could he
make such a âbad bargainâ? How in general he could send a
Note on such an important question on his own account, I
fail to understand....

N.B. Send us Arbeiterpolitik, the Stuttgart
Sozialdemokrat[2] and similar publications, all, complete, 5â10 copies
of each.




Have you begun some legal publication in German? What
precisely? What is the plan of publication and when will it
appear?

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the spring of 1918 the German interventionists occupied the
Ukraine, invaded the Crimea and approached Sevastopol, where
the Black Sea Fleet was concentrated. On April 29â30, to save
the fleet from the invaders, the Soviet Government transferred it
to Novorossiisk. Ten days after the fleetâs arrival there, the
German Command sent an ultimatum demanding its return to
Sevastopol, threatening otherwise to continue the offensive along the
Black Sea coast. On MayÂ 11, the Soviet Government sent a â
Protest to the German Government against the Occupation of the
Crimeaâ, stating the circumstances of the fleetâs transfer and the
possible conditions for its return to Sevastopol (see present
edition, Vol.Â 27, pp. 358â59).


All attempts to reach an agreement with, the German
Government on this question were abortive. Having no possibility of
saving the fleet and to avoid surrendering it to the German
imperialists, Lenin issued an order to the Supreme Military
Council for its immediate destruction (see the next document). A secret
instruction of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars ordered the
destruction of all the ships of the Black Sea Fleet and merchant
steamships in Novorossiisk. On June 18â19, 1918, the order of the
government was carried out: most of the ships were sunk off the
Novorossiisk coast.





[2]
Arbeiterpolitikâa weekly periodical of scientific socialism, the
organ of the Bremen group of Left Social-Democrats, which in
1919 joined the Communist Party of Germany. It was published
in Bremen from 1916 to 1919.

Der Sozialdemokratâa daily newspaper, the organ of the
Independent Social-Democratic Party of WÃ¼rttemberg. It was
published in Stuttgart from 1915. In 1921, it became the organ
of the United Communist Party of WÃ¼rttemberg and was
published under the title Kommunist.

Moscow, MayÂ 24, 1918

Dear Comrade Shahumyan,

I take the opportunity to send you once again a few words
(I sent you a letter by hand recently; did you receive
it?[1]).

The Baku situation is a difficult one internationally.
I would advise you therefore to attempt a bloc with
Jordania. If that is impossible, you must manoeuvre and 
postpone a decision until you are stronger militarily. A sober
estimate and diplomacy for a postponementâremember
that.

Get the radio going and send me letters through
Astrakhan.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Soviet of Deputies
 Kineshma

To all workers of the Kineshma district. Comrade workers,
the rich in the villages of the producing gubernias are
hoarding huge stocks of grain and not giving them up for the
starving workers. The rich prefer to sell grain at exorbitant
speculative prices, which only the city bourgeoisie can
pay, but not the poor, starving population. While
speculating in grain, the rich seek to speculate also in the goods
they receive in exchange for grain. The city bourgeoisie
is agitating for the abolition of the grain monopoly and
fixed prices, and for freedom to trade in grain. The
bourgeoisie is passing from agitation to provocation; it is

  Â  

skilfully and surreptitiously inciting the starving workers to
demonstrations, disturbances and disorders, while
endeavouring to seize power in its own hands. The Council of
Peopleâs Commissars is exerting every effort in the
struggle to uphold the grain monopoly, in the absence of which
only the bourgeoisie will prosper while the poor will be
left without any grain at all. Comrade workers, do not
give way to the provocation of the dark forces, do not play
into the hands of the bourgeoisie and the counterâ
revolutionaries who want to make catâs-paws of you and destroy
all the gains of the revolution. Do not disorganise the hard
work of obtaining grain for you by thoughtless actions on
your part and independent exchange of goods. The Council
of Peopleâs Commissars is now exchanging goods for grain
on a vast scale; it has begun requisitioning grain stocks
from the village bourgeoisie by means of armed
detachments. If you want to help, to co-operate with your workersâ
and peasantsâ government, act in an organised way: select
from among you those who are most familiar with the food
business for work in the Soviet food supply bodies, recruit
fighting detachments of honest, incorruptible, steadfast
revolutionaries, true champions of the interests of the
workers and peasants. Immediately detain provocators and
agents of the counter-revolution and deliver them to
Moscow. Bear firmly in mind: either we extricate ourselves
from all our unprecedented difficulties in an organised way,
and with honour, or everything is inevitably doomed, to
complete ruin. There is no other alternative. In the
expectation of speedy results from these measures, the Council
of Peopleâs Commissars asks you, comrade workers, to
display revolutionary self-discipline and political alertness in
order to save the gains of the revolution and ensure the
triumph, of the proletarian dictatorship.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs
Commissars[1]

Shlyapnikov

The Central Committee has passed a decision to direct
the maximum number of Party workers to the food front.

For obviously we shall perish and ruin the whole
revolution if we do not conquer famine in the next few months.

It is essential that you he temporarily employed on food
supply (while retaining the rank of Peopleâs Commissar
for Labour). I am confident that you will carry out the
directive of the C.C.

I think that you ought to go to the Kuban to help pump
grain out from there.

You must decide today and make immediate arrangements
with Tsyurupa.

V.Â I.,


How has the question about using the army in the struggle for
requisitioning grain been decided? If it has been decided
affirmatively, how will the thing be arranged officiallyâ

 X

by way of an
agreement with the Commissariat for Military Affairs or by the issue of a
decree?[1]



It is very important to know this, for today Kudinsky has been
arrested (apparently by Comrade Dzerzhinskyâs Commission); our
work threatens to come to a complete stop.

A.Â Tsyurupa

X


Precisely along these lines. Telephone Trotsky today
(from my box), so that he gets everything moving tomorrow.
 

I have just written to Shlyapnikov about his going to
the Kuban. He should make arrangements with you today.
I advise you right now, today, to appoint him from the
C.P.C.


Stalin has agreed to go to the Northern Caucasus. Send him. He
knows the local conditions. Shlyapnikov will find it better with him
too.

A.Â Ts.

I fully agree. See them both off today.

The bearers are representatives of the Yelets Soviet.
Will you please publish an interview with them in the
newspaper. It is a model uyezd as regards good order,
registration of cultivated estates and their economy, and
as regards suppression of the bourgeoisie.

With comradely greetings,

Comrade Zinoviev,

The bearer, Comrade Bach, has a mandate from
Centrotransport of Siberia. He asks to hasten the issue and
dispatch to Siberia of 137Â automobiles which the Motor

  Â  

Section (of Petrograd) (the Petrograd Commune) requested
the Motor Centre to remove from Petrograd as useless. We
have passed a decision to have all lorries handed over to
the food
department.[1]

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a decision of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
on May 8, 1918, to take stock of all available automobiles and
lorries and transfer all surplus lorries to the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Food.

Vedernikov
 Vyksa
 Kulebaki, Kazan-Moscow Railway

I very much hope that the worker comrades of Vyksa,
in carrying out their excellent plan of a mass movement
with, machine-guns to obtain grain, will act as genuine
revolutionaries, that is, they will staff the detachment
with selected reliable people who will not behave like
robbers, and who will work to the schedules and in full
agreement with Tsyurupa for the common cause of saving from
famine all the starving people, and not merely for
themselves.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin sent this telegram to the Vyksa workers in reply to one
received from them which stated that they were âabsolutely
starvingâ, and were going out by steamboats with their
detachments and machine-guns in order to obtain grain by force.

Through the American comrade Albert R. Williams I
send my greetings to the American socialist
internationalists. I firmly believe that in the long run the social

revolution will be victorious in all civilised countries.
When it begins in America it will far surpass the Russian
revolution.

2/VI. 1918

Comrade Joffe,

Sokolnikov and Bukharin are to make a trip to you, and
Larin, too, I
believe.[1] I take this opportunity to give
you a little warning. I am sitting at a meeting with the
âtravellersâ (without Larin). I hear talk about âJoffe
transferring the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to Berlinâ.

The friction between you and Chicherin is sometimes
usedâunconsciously rather than consciouslyâas a means
towards intensifying this friction.

I am confident that you will be on your guard and will
not allow this friction to grow. I have read attentively
your letters and I am absolutely convinced that this
friction is unimportant (there is chaos everywhere,
carelessness everywhereâin all commissariatsâand this evil is
slow to cure). Given patience and persistence the friction
will be smoothed over. Chicherin is a splendid worker.
Your line is quite faithful to the Brest treaty, you are 
already successful, I thinkâand hence it follows that we shall
easily smooth away the friction.

If the German traders will accept economic advantages,
realising that nothing is to be got from us by war, for we
shall burn everythingâthen your policy will continue to be
successful. We can give the Germans raw materials. In
important cases, send me copies of your exact demands.
Arrange for a direct line as quickly as possible.

Bukharin acts in good faith, but he is up to the neck
in âLeft stupidnessâ. Sokolnikov has gone astray again.

  Â  

Larin is a floundering intellectual, a first-class bungler.
Therefore be extremely on your guard with all these most
charming, most admirable delegates. Sokolnikov is a very
valuable worker, but sometimes (as just now) something
âcomes over himâ and he âbreaks chinaâ because of
paradoxes. If you do not take precautions, he will break china
there with you. And Bukharinâtriply so. Prenez garde!

I hope that Krasin and Hanecki, being business-like
people, will help you and the whole matter will be smoothed out.


Thank you for the âsupplementâ to your letter. I await
some more.

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S.

N.B.: Among the Russian Bolsheviks taken prisoner
by Germany (Zivilgefangene) was Popov of Brussels, taken
in Belgium: Could you find him and take him into our
service?



P.P.S. Try to send this enclosure to Switzerland by
messengerâbut not by
post.[2]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Sokolnikov, Bukharin and Larin went to Berlin as members of
the Soviet delegation to negotiate an economic agreement with
Germany.

Evidently this refers to Leninâs letter of June 2, 1918, to J.Â A.
Berzin or G.Â L. Shklovsky (see Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 50,

Tsyurupa:

In view of the furious agitation of enemies and â
waverersâ and its influence on the workers in Petrograd,
Moscow, etc.,Â 

I think you ought to publish (and distribute as a
leaflet at the factories) something in the nature of a letter
to the workers, saying:Â 

they are trying to scare youâ

the waverers are sowing panicâ

they are talking of âindependent procurementsââ

they criticise the âcentreâ, throwing the blame on
othersâ

and so forth.

But you, workers, should not believe the whiners,
sowers of panic and fault-finders,Â 

but set to work: let every factory send to our aid
trustworthy people with a guarantee, with a surety, we shall
show them where the obstacle lies, what the difficulty is,
and they will help us.

Would you be able to place such people?
A.Â D. TSYURUPAâS REPLY


Yes, we can arrange if. Your proposal will be implemented. A
small group of workers has already had a number of reports on the
food question read to them (something like lectures) and this group
will shortly be going to the area of Tambov and Voronezh gubernias
with our representative. We have asked
  X

all
Soviets,[1]

Bolshevik
committees and trade unions to give us reliable people.

Tsyurupa:

X


Are the factory committees, at least those of the big
plants, included here? This is important.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Underlined by Lenin.âEd.
 



[2]
Leninâs notes to A.Â D. Tsyurupa were written in connection with
the need to explain to the mass of the working people the

 Â  

decision on independent procurements adopted by the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars on JuneÂ 1, 1918. The decision pointed out
that independent grain procurements, for which the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars was being asked by representatives of some
organisations and trade unions, could disrupt the whole business
of food supply, clear the way for the kulaks and landowners, and
ruin the revolution. The decision set the task of organising food
detachments, selecting for them the best and most devoted people
from among the workers and office personnel âin order to form
a general working-class fighting force for establishing order, for
assisting with supervision, for collecting all grain surpluses, for
complete victory over speculatorsâ (Dekrety Sovetskoi vlasti,
Vol.Â II, pp. 379â81).

On this subject see also present edition, Vol.Â 27, pp. 416â17.

Comrade Tsyurupa,

I am sending to you representatives of the Vyshny
Volochok Soviet.

The famine there is appalling. It is urgently necessary
to help by every means and to give at least something
immediately.

I have already talked with these comrades about forming
detachments and on the tasks of the food work, but you, too,
should have a talk with them.

Zinoviev

I do not remember giving permission for contacts with
Omsk.
 

I shall make inquiries of Podbelsky.

I advise you to make no transactions, direct or indirect,
with the Omsk
counter-revolutionaries.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
After the capture of Omsk by Czech and Russian whiteguards
on JuneÂ 7, 1918, a Siberian whiteguard puppet government was
set up there with the assistance of the interventionists. It
consisted in the main of Socialist-Revolutionaries, with Mensheviks
and Constitutional-Democrats participating. Behind a screen of
democratic phrases it pursued a counter-revolutionary policy,
paving the way for the transition to an open military dictatorship
of the bourgeoisie and landowners.

G.Â Y. Zinovievâs inquiry concerned the purchase of grain
in Omsk for Petrograd.

In view of the events in Samara and Omsk, the interruption of
railway traffic between Perm and Vyatka and the complete
uncertainty as to the transport situation on the Permâ
Ekaterinburg-Tyumen line, which have completely cut off Siberia, without waiting
for your consent I am sending by water route the technical workers
from Vyatka and Ufa gubernias about whom I informed you in
telegramÂ 363. Please receive them and put them to work immediately by
distributing them among the places of grain procurement and, if
necessary, among the places along the routes for dispatching and
forwarding grain. Among those being sent are top-level people
absolutely suitable for technical work in the centre and in the
Extraordinary Regional Food Committee, and efficient organisers for grain
collecting in the localities. To use these people, For whose honesty
I am ready to vouch, is essential and inevitable, since no greater and
better technical forces are to be found. Offer them to fix the rate of
their remuneration themselves and, although I am sure of their being
sufficiently modest, I recommend you not to stint payment for their
work. Telegraph me.

Tsyurupa
Peopleâs Commissar for Food

I urgently advise you to receive the people sent by
Tsyurupa and put them to work, since he vouches for them.

  Â  

It is extremely important to make use of experienced,
honest practical workers.

I urgently advise you to take advantage of the present
moment to step up dispatch of the greatest possible number

There are arms in Vologda.

I hope you received my request to send more detachments

You are directed to submit information without delay
as to what exactly has been done to implement the decree
of 13. IV. 1918, particularly in regard to
1) the removal
of old monuments,
2) their replacement by new monuments,
at least temporary ones, and
3) the replacement of old
inscriptions on public buildings by new ones (Â§Â 5 of the
decree).[2]

The two monthsâ procrastination in carrying out the
decreeâimportant both as propaganda and as providing
work to the unemployedâis unpardonable.

Chairman,
C.P.C.[1]

Tsyurupa

I very much fear that we underestimate the âPenzaâ
danger both as regards food and in a general political
respect, and that in fact we shall not be able to send
âagitatorsâ.

Should we not adopt urgent measures to take a good food
detachment (of Petrograd workers or the like) and get it
moving at once, impressing upon them the task: for the
first few weeks you will act as agitators.
  Â

Tsyurupa

I think it necessary that you most urgently get in
touchÂ 

1)  with PetrogradÂ 

2) with SverdlovÂ 

concerning the dispatch to Penza and Penza Gubernia of
some 50Â people (agitators) from among Petrograd and
Moscow workers.

Gorbunov

Tell Minkin that Syzran has been taken by the
Czechs.[1]
But we must not give way to panic. Our forces are
preparing to hit back. The Penza people, too, should prepare
firmly and energetically. Our success is assured if we do
not remain inactive.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the capture of Syzran by units of the
Czechoslovak Army Corps.

This Corps was formed in Russia before the October
Revolution from among Czechs and Slovaks who were taken prisoner
as soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the agreement of
March 26, 1918, the Soviet Government gave the Corps the
opportunity of leaving Russia via Vladivostok on condition that it
surrender its weapons and remove its Russian commanders.
But on the orders and with the support of the imperialists of
the U.S.A., Britain and France, the counter-revolutionary
commanders of the Corps engineered an armed revolt by the Corps
against the Soviet government at the end of May. Acting
in close contact with the whiteguards and kulaks, the White
Czechoslovak Corps occupied a considerable part of the Urals,
the Volga area and Siberia.

In the districts occupied by the Czechoslovak mutineers,
whiteguard governments were formed with the participation of
the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.

Many soldiers in the Corps, seeing how they had been betrayed
by their counter-revolutionary command, refused to fight against

__PRINTERS_P_481_COMMENT__
16â2075

 Â  

Soviet Russia and deserted from the Corps. About 12,000 Czechs
and Slovaks fought in the ranks of the Red Army.

The Volga area was liberated by the Red Army in the
autumn of 1918. The White Czechoslovak Corps was completely
routed simultaneously with the wiping out of Kolchakâs forces.

18/VI.

Comrade Joffe,

I am extremely astonished and angry at the absence
of news from Switzerland. I am told that couriers travel
there weekly. Yet not a word!

What are Berzin and Shklovsky doing?

Please forward this letter to them and take measures to
receive a reply.

It is urgently necessary to have sent here from
SwitzerlandÂ 

Juniusâs pamphlet,Â  
 

Karl Liebknechtâs pamphlet,Â 

a set of cuttings from Berner Tagwacht and other
publications (all documents on the movement of the Lefts in
Germany and
Austria).[1]

This must be republished immediately in book form
(separate issues) in Switzerland.

Commission someone in Germany (in Berlin) to do the
same job, using the materials of the Partei-Archiv or of
any library having complete sets of newspapers for the
war years (RÃ¼hleâs article on the split in VorwÃ¤rts,
12. I. 1915 or
1916,[2] etc.).

Referenten-Material from Niederbarnim (quoted in
Legionâs pamphlet: Warum mÃ¼ssen die GewerkschaftsfÃ¼hrer,
u.s.w.)[3] and everything of this kind to be collected
immediately.

Itâs really scandalous that nothing is being done in this
field.

For this work two Germans (Borchardt would be suitable)
and two Swiss can (and should) be hired, and it should be
published immediately in German, French and English.

Lenin

Regarding the ships in Novorossiisk the matter has not
yet been fully cleared up. But we have taken all measures
and I hope the order will be carried
out.[4]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the following writings: the pamphlet by
Rosa LuxemburgâJunius, Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie; the
pamphlet circulated in Germany in manuscript form: 
Klassenkampf gegen den Krieg! Material zum âFallâ Liebknecht (Class
Struggle Against the War. Material to Liebknechtâs âCaseâ);
cuttings from the newspaper Berner Tagwacht, organ of the
Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland.





[2]
The article by the German Left Social-Democrat 0.Â RÃ¼hle, âZur
Parteispaltungâ (On the Split in the Party), was published on
January 12, 1916, in No.Â 11 of VorwÃ¤rts, the central organ of the
German Social-Democratic Party.





[3]
Referenten-Material aus Niederbarnimâa (Niederbarnimâsuburb of
Berlin) was quoted in Legienâs pamphlet entitled Warum
mÃ¼ssen die GewerkschaftsfunktionÃ¤re sich mehr am inneren Parteileben
beteiltgen? (Why Must Trade Union Functionaries Take More
Part in the Partyâs Internal Affairs?).





[4]
This refers to the German Governmentâs demand for the ships
of the Black Sea Fleet to be transferred from Novorossiisk to
Sevastopol. See this volume, Document 88 and Note 60.

So far there has been no decree on nationalisation of

  Â  

the oil industry towards the close of the navigational
season. For the time being we are organising a state monopoly
of trade in oil products. Take all measures for the speediest

2) The compiler of the agenda, the secretary (Gorbunov

matter of expenditure or allocations;Â 

2) whether inquiries have been made of the departments

1) Who and when are you sending to the local areas
(Schlichter, Bryukhanov, who else? and where to?)?

2) Weâve had a talk with Pravdin (he arrived today
from Tula, Yelets, Orel).

There is grain,
 exemplary order,
 power in the hands of the poor peasants.

3) Who are you sending to Tambov and with what
detachments? Should not Bryukhanov be sent there? The most
energetic person is needed there.

(Today I had a talk with people from Tambov; the
harvest is unprecedented; there is also old grain; the kulaks
can be brought to heel, but there is a lack of organisers
and detachments.)

4) Are we going to put up with the absence of a (food)
dictatorship in Moscow? Itâs a scandal! A disgrace!
 


Schlichter is going to Yefremov Uyezd, Tula Gubernia. I sent a
comrade to Zinoviev in Petrograd (or workers for his detachment.
Urgent loading of goods is in progress at present. In about
5 daysâ
time he will set
out.[1]


A.Â Ts.

Tsyurupa

Five days for an exchange of telegrams with Zinoviev
(who long ago was asking where to send detachments) and
for loading the goods (1Â day??).

This is monstrous red tape. Appoint ten officialsâ
scoundrels from the Food Commissariatâand demand that
everything be done in 1Â day or in 2Â days, otherwise
dismissal and prosecution.

28/VI. 1918

Comrade Smirnov
 or Petrovsky, Peopleâs Commissar for Internal Affairs,
 and Comrade Gukovsky, Peopleâs Commissar for Finance

I strongly recommend the bearer, Comrade Semyon
Ivanovich Lebedev, Chairman of the Temnikov Soviet,
Tambov Gubernia.

He asks for a loan of 1Â 1/2Â million. From his account
it is evident that affairs in the uyezd are exemplary. A
most instructive example of a model uyezd where the kulaks
have in actual fact been ousted from all the Soviets. In
my opinion, such an uyezd should be given priority
assistance.

Secret

Peopleâs Commissar Stalin
 Tsaritsyn

Today, JuneÂ 30, information was received from Joffe in
Berlin that KÃ¼hlmann had a preliminary conversation with
Joffe. From this conversation it is evident that the
Germans agree to compel the Turks to cease hostilities beyond
the Brest frontier, having established a precise
demarcation line for us. They promise not to allow the Turks into
Baku, but they want to receive oil. Joffe has replied that
we shall adhere strictly to Brest, but quite agree with the
principle of give and take. Pay the greatest attention to
this information and try to pass it oil as soon as possible
to Shahumyan, for now there are very serious chances of
holding on to Baku. Some oil, of course, we shall give.

1. VII. 1918

Dear Comrade Joffe,

I am, to tell the truth, extremely angry with you. We are
short-handed, everyone is devilishly overworked, yet you
go and do a thing like this: you write a lot on business
matters in a personal letter to me (the last one, in
pencil) and insert a number of personal thrusts, attacks,
pinpricks and so on against Chicherin (ânot a realâ
m-r[1]

and so on). To Chicherin, on the other hand, you write:
âprospects in the letter to Leninâ.

Damn it, itâs the frozen limit!

Chicherin, naturally, asks me for the letter, and I canât
show it, because I donât want to be an instrument of
squabble. The result is that the work suffers and relations suffer.

Chicherin is a splendid worker, most conscientious,
shrewd, knowledgeable. Such people should be highly
appreciated. That his failing is lack of âcommandershipâ
does not matter. There are plenty of people in this world
who have the opposite failing!

Chicherin is a man you can work with, he is easy to work
with, but the work can be spoiled even with him.

You find fault with him, but the Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs has a right to complain of you, too, because
you do not reckon with him, and without the knowledge
and permission of the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign
Affairs, ambassadors are not, of course, entitled to take
decisive steps.

I hope you will take all measures to eliminate these
Mi&BwhatthestÃ¤nde.[2]


That you have got Krasin âon the moveâ is very good.
Keep on at Shklovsky with all your might; he is a
lazybones; demand reports and more reports, use threats.

All the best,
 Lenin

Secret

Personal from Lenin to Krasin
 Russian Embassy, Berlin

I fully appreciate Joffeâs work and certainly approve
it, but I emphatically demand that Joffe should behave as
an ambassador whose superior is the Peopleâs Commissar
for Foreign Affairs, and should observe the decencies, not
abusing and not slighting other people, and consulting
the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs on all important
matters. Only then can I and will I support Ambassador
Joffe. I rely on your tact to impress this upon Ambassador
Joffe, and await a reply.

Lenin replies:

Kolegayev told me personally as well as Zinoviev and
many others, that he, Kolegayev, is opposed to the present
policy of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. I do not
doubt that the crazily hysterical and provocative adventure
culminating in the murder of Mirbach and revolt of the
Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
against the Soviet power will lose them not only the
majority of their workers and peasants, but also many
intellectuals. The revolt was suppressed completely in a single
day. Hundreds of people have been arrested.

Put on record Muravyovâs declaration of his withdrawal
from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and continue
to keep him under vigilant control. I am confident that if
these conditions are observed we shall fully succeed in
utilising his excellent fighting qualities. The struggle
against the Czechoslovaks and Cossacks must be waged
with treble energy.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

K.Â A. Mekhonoshin, a member of the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Eastern Front, asked by direct line for
information concerning the situation resulting from the revolt of the
Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow on JulyÂ 6, 1918. He
asked to be informed what stand the Left Socialist-Revolutionary
A.Â L. Kolegayev had taken. Mekhonoshin also reported that
M.Â A. Muravyov, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary in command of
the troops of the Eastern Front, had proclaimed his loyalty to
Soviet power and stated that he renounced his membership
of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party because that party
opposed Soviet power.

However, Muravyov made this statement in order to conceal
his own treacherous activity. On receiving a telegram from the
Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party
alleging that the Left S.R.s had succeeded in seizing power in
Moscow, he went over to the insurgents. According to their plan,
Muravyov was to make the troops on the Eastern Front take up arms
against Soviet power and, after joining forces with the White
Czechs, to march on Moscow. On JulyÂ 10, on arriving at Simbirsk,

 Â  

Muravyov announced that he did not recognise the Brest peace
and declared war on Germany.

The Soviet Government took urgent measures to liquidate
Muravyovâs adventure. A government statement of JulyÂ 11
declared him a traitor and enemy of Soviet power. On the evening
of JulyÂ 11, Muravyov was invited to a sitting of the Simbirsk
Executive Committee. When Muravyovâs traitorous telegrams on
the cessation of military operations against the interventionists
and whiteguards were read out at the sitting, the Communists
demanded his arrest. Muravyov offered resistance and was killed,
and his accomplices were arrested.

{{


1) full text,


2) inscriptions in all languages, etc.

Regarding the design of the new money.

I have already ordered this from Zax. It is a mere trifle,
really.

Do it or have it done tomorrow morning.

You are sabotaging, really! Now, what is so important

Gubernia Military Commissar
 Voronezh

I read your note to Trotsky. He and I fully agree that
the telegram from Saratov is trustworthy and should be
promulgated, for it comes from people who sincerely
condemn the adventure of the Central Committee of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This evidently refers to the fact that at a meeting convened by
the Saratov Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party
in connection with the Left Socialist-Revolutionariesâ revolt in
Moscow, a decision was adopted condemning the actions of the C.C.
of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries tending to undermine Soviet
power. The Saratov combat squad of Left Socialistâ
Revolutionaries at their meeting denounced the treachery of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow and declared that they stood by
the platform of defence of Soviet power.

On receipt of a report from Saratov on the decisions adopted
by the meeting of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, Lenin sent
it to Pravda with the following introductory words: âCommissar
Ivanov, travelling to the Caucasus, reports from Saratov.â It was
published in Pravda with this introduction.

I have received a complaint from Stanislaw Palinski,
an old Polish revolutionary who is recommended by
Steklov. Palinski has been arrested at the Berezniki soda works,
Verkhstiya post-station, Perm Gubernia, on a charge of
counter-revolutionary activity and sympathy for the
Czechoslovaks.

Palinski writes that the Legal Commission of the Usolye
Uyezd Soviet found nothing criminal in his actions.

I urgently request you to carry out a strict check and
impartial examination of the matter, and allow Palinski
passage to Poland.

Podvoisky

I did not reply to the second telegram because such
an appointment does not depend on me, and in general
it is hardly possible, as it upsets the whole order of
things.[1]

The Czechoslovak (and kulak) danger is so grave that
I think you ought to make (and Trotsky will probably
agree) a tour of the Western and Southern (German) fronts,
etc., to speed up the transference of troops from there to
the Czechoslovak front.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Podvoisky had proposed taking upon himself the leadership in
suppressing the Czechoslovak revolt and counter-revolutionary
actions in the Volga area and the Urals.

Comrade
Sereda,[1]


The bearers are members of the Land Department of the
Moscow Gubernia Soviet, Please receive themâthe matter

  Â  

is an important one. I think the âstate farmsâ and the
communes should be merged. Practical measures for
assistance and control should be discussed. Try to help with
tractors.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Discuss whether a decree of the C.P.C. is needed for
Moscow Gubernia. Please make haste.

Natsarenus, Military Commissar Extraordinary
 Petrozavodsk

I am passing your telegram on to the Commissariat for
Food. The food situation now is as bad as it can be. We shall
hardly be able to help. Everything that is best and most
reliable has to be organised for sending detachments to
the Czechoslovak front. Without victory over the
Czechoslovaks there will be no grain.

Comrade Larin,

It is necessary to write a short pamphlet (30â40
small-sized pages) on the composition and activities of the
Supreme Economic Council.
 

This is of extreme importance both for Europe and for
the peasants.

Describe clearly and simply, giving facts:

(Î±) the participation of workersâ organisations,Â 

(Î²) the communist (Marxist), not syndicalist, nature of
the structure (i.e., of the new socialist system, order),Â 

(Î³) subjection (i.e., smashing the resistance) of the
capitalists,Â 

(Î´) the successes achieved in practice (we have taken
stock of all textiles: figures), 5-10 of the best examples,
etc.

(Îµ) What still remains to be done?

(Î¶) The new role of the trade unions:


(Î±Î±) their growth,Â 
 (Î²Î²) their membership at the present time,Â 
 (Î³Î³) their role: they run production.

(Î·) The number of nationalised enterprises,
etc.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Later, in reply to an inquiry from Lydia Fotieva about this letter
of Leninâs, Larin informed her: âThe letter from Vladimir Ilyich
which you sent (concerning the drafting of a pamphlet about the
Supreme Economic Council) was never received by me. Perhaps

 Â  

it relates to the time when (in 1918) I was sent to Berlin to
conduct negotiations with the Germans, and was to be handed to me
on my return. At any rate, soon after returning I received a letter
from Vladimir Ilyich on a similar subject, only broader in
contentâto write about the Soviet Republic in general, not merely
about the Supreme Economic Council (the letter has not been
found.âEd.), so as to acquaint people abroad and our own
population with what had been achieved in one year. To this end,
Vladimir Ilyich later wrote an order to all government departments
to give me all the information I needed (see Lenin Miscellany XXI,
p.Â 139.âEd.). But the material sent in by the departments was
far from satisfactory and we had to abandon the thought of
compiling such a factual report of the government for the first
year of our rule, the idea of which had apparently dismissed from
Vladimir Ilyichâs mind the proposal for a pamphlet about the
Supreme Economic Council alone.âÂ 

Connected with Leninâs instructions mentioned by Larin in
his letter to Fotieva is the decision drafted by Lenin and adopted
by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on August 29, 1918,
calling for written reports to be submitted by the Peopleâs
Commissariats on their work since October 25 (November 7), 1917, and
Leninâs letter to the Peopleâs Commissars on this question (see
present edition, Vol.Â 36, p.Â 493; Vol.Â 35, DocumentÂ 168).

1.Â VIII.Â 1918

Comrades Kobozev, Danishevsky, Mekhonoshin
 and Raskolnikov

Comrades,

I take this opportunity to send you a few words by
messenger.

Are the army commanders and Vatsetis working
vigorously enough? Is the commissarsâ control over them good
enough?

What are the opinions about Blokhin? Is it true that
he is splendid? If so, is he being given enough scope?

Of course, I am judging from a distance and can easily
be mistaken. But I am afraid lest the âstaffsâ should
smother the live work below, the work of the masses? Is there
sufficient contact in the military field with the masses
of poor peasants?

Is everything
being done to rouse them and draw them
into the work?

Now the entire
fate of the revolution rests on one card:
swift victory over the Czechoslovaks on the KazanâUralsâ
Samara front.

Everything depends on this.

Is the command sufficiently energetic? Is the offensive
sufficiently vigorous?

Please reply, if only in a few words, both by telegraph
and by messenger.

Regards,
 Lenin

3/VIII.

Comrade Joffe

Everything you write in your recent letters is the height
of absurdity.

To pursue the âformerâ policy of not breaking with the
Entente after the Onega events is
ludicrous.[1] You canât
restore chastity to a dame with a baby.

It is also absurd to apply the term intervention or aid
to the fact that we are continuing to manoeuvre, allowing
the Germans to take what the Entente has already taken,
thereby making more difficult and delaying the
Anglo-American-Japanese throttling of Russia.

Without knowing the facts and without reflecting on
them, you have fallen into error with the memorandum
and the rest. If you wish to insist on it, hand in your
resignation to the C.C. Until you do so, until the C.C. has accepted
your resignation, until a substitute has been sent to you,
and until his arrival, you, of course, as a Party member
(as you yourself write) will do your duty.

Gruss,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JulyÂ 31, 1918, the Entente interventionists landed troops in
Onega and seized the town.

3. VIII. 1918

Comrade Berzin,

The bearers are Italian prisoners of war, who have
presented to us a recommendation from the Chairman of the
Ufa Soviet. I have seen them twice and have received a
very pleasant impression from my talk with them. It is

  Â  

necessary to exercise the maximum caution and help them
in every way to organise work and publications among
Italians, in the Italian language.

Thanks for the letters.

You are evidently working hard. Greetings!

For Godâs sake, do not grudge money for publications
(in German, French, Italian and English) and be quick, be
quick.

It is a critical moment here: the struggle against the
British and Czechoslovaks, and the kulaks. The fate of the
revolution is being decided.

Yours,
 Lenin

Comrades Tsyurupa and Panyushkin

From Panyushkinâs report it is evident that he is
working splendidly, but is incredibly squandering his energies,
taking on a hundred things at once.

This is impermissible.

Panyushkin must be given a strictly defined, precise
assignment, laid down in writing:

(1) to seize and requisition all grain surpluses from the
kulaks and the rich of the whole Tula Gubernia;

(2) to dispatch all this grain immediately to Moscow;

(3) no other fob whatsoever to be undertaken until this
assignment has been completely fulfilled.

For carrying out the work use as many motor-lorries as
possible.

Tsyurupa

Every effort must be made now so that in actual fact
both decrees (on harvesting detachments and on collective
trains)Â 

are merged in practice and provide us with our
detachments.[1]

What is being done in this direction?

1) Instruction: in the collective trains a certain
proportion in each (1 in 5, for example) should be from the trade
unions,Â 

2) Â§Â 7 of the decree on collective trains should be
developed and strengthened,Â 

3) their correlation (in effectâhelp) with the
requisitioning detachments....

4) Assign them all to a maximum of 2Â uyezds (from among
the best) and sweep these clean.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the following decrees of the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars drafted on the basis of Leninâs âTheses on the Food
Questionâ written on August 2, 1918 (see present edition, Vol.Â 
28, pp. 45â47): âOn Drawing Workersâ Organisations into Grain
Procurementâ (in Leninâs letter it is called a decree on collective
trains) and âOn Harvesting and Harvesting-Requisitioning
Detachmentsâ. The decrees were adopted at the sittings of the Council
of Peopleâs Commissars on AugustÂ 3 and 4, 1918, and published
in Izvestia on AugustÂ 6.

ClauseÂ 7 of the decree âOn Drawing Workersâ Organisations
into Grain Procurementâ, mentioned lower down in the document,
states: âDetachments setting out to procure grain are obliged to
assist the local population in bringing in the harvest.â

Bryukhanov and other members of the Board
 of the Food Commissariat

I gather from your note that the Food Commissariat
understands and applies the decrees incorrectly.

âNo special desire is noticeable among the workersÂ ...â
(to join harvesting detachments).

Where are the proofs? Where is the appeal of the Food
Commissariat? What is the date of it?

In which factories was it distributed? When and in how
many copies?

I am afraid the Food Commissariat did none of these
things (judging by Comrade Bryukhanovâs silence), but
occupied itself with the devil knows what bureaucratic

  Â  

red tape. For without the help of the workers the Food
Commissariat is nil.

Nothing bad is to be seen from the quotation (from
Nevskyâs telegram of 8.Â VIII), for it does not touch on the
question of % of trade union members, or of the leading
organisation, or of participation and harvesting (Â§Â 7 of the
decree on collective trains), i.e., the business questions
are not dealt with.

Whatâs bad about Nevskyâs telegram besides the good?
Nevsky calls on the workers: go out and help (he says
nothing about conditions, but we indicated these conditions
and indicated good ones). But the Food Commissariat cavils
at a word (when thereâs nothing to cavil at)Â ... and itself
does nothing!

Either we rouse the mass of the workers to join in a
serious movement for grain (and for crushing the kulaks)â
this the Food Commissariat does not doÂ 

âor else, no Food Commissariat at all is needed.

Executive Committee went to Vologda to report to M.Â S. Kedrov on
the situation on the Northern Dvina. In Vologda, they learned of
L.Â D. Trotskyâs order, which demanded that the functionaries
who had left Archangel should be regarded as deserters and tried
by the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal. The group of Communists,
outraged by this order, since they were not directly to blame for
the fall of Archangel, sent a request to Lenin and Sverdlov to be
allowed to come to Moscow and report the truth about the events.
In reply, Lenin seat the telegram published here.

Tsyurupa:

(1) It is a great scandal, an outrageous scandal, that
there is grain in Saratov and we cannot get it away!! What
about having one or two food officials sent to each railway
junction? What more can be done?

(2) Draft of a decreeâ25â30 hostages from among the rich
in each grain-producing volost, answering with their lives
for the collection and delivery of all surpluses.

(3)  Instruct Popov urgently
to make up delivery orders
by volosts. That is, how much surplus grain there should
be in each volost. How much should each give?
2

Tsyurupa

1) You have not replied about âhostagesâ.

2) When will Popov finish his work? (He must be given
a short time limit.)
3

I propose that âhostagesâ should not be taken but 
designated by name for each volost.

The purpose of designating them: it is the rich peasants
who, in the same way as they answer for contribution,
will answer with their lives for the prompt collection and
delivery of grain surpluses.

An instruction to this effect (to designate âhostagesâ)
to be givenÂ 
 (Î±) to the Poor Peasantsâ Committees,
 (Î²) to all food detachments.

Force? Just now in the front-line area, there will be a
force.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Replying to the preceding note from Lenin, Tsyurupa wrote:
âHostages can be taken when there is a real force. But is there?
It is doubtful.â

M.Â D. Bonch-Bruyevich, personal

I consider it essential to reinforce the Eastern Front
to the utmost. I direct the Supreme Military Council to
draw up a plan for the withdrawal of the greatest possible
number of units from the Western Front. This plan should
be carried out in the shortest possible time. All
battle-worthy units should go. The railways will receive orders
to let through without delay all units already going to the
front, and will make every preparation for handling new ones.

I direct the Supreme Military Council to supervise the
accuracy and speed with which the railways fulfil the
orders. The Chairman of the Supreme Military Council to
report to me about delays.

I place responsibility for the speediest fulfilment of the
plan on the Supreme Military Council.

In case of need you will be given permission to use the

disarming and expelling demoralised units and hooligan
elements. For this highly important work, take members
of the local Executive Committee and Regional Committee
to assist you, for this is a matter of paramount state
importance. Inform local Executive Committees and Party
Committees of this telegram.

This telegram is the reply to a message by direct line from D.Â T.
Petruchuk, representative of the Moscow Regional Commissariat
for Military Affairs, who had been sent to Orsha to expedite the
dispatch of Red Army units to the Eastern Front. Petruchuk
reported demoralisation in a number of army units and poor work
on the part of local Soviet bodies, and he asked to be allowed
to use the direct line.

Can it be arranged for detachments to go out for grain
(to procure and transport by express goods train) according
to alternative instructions, namely:Â 

either for one time (to one volost, etc., for threshing
in a uyezd, etc.)âthen the bonus will be less,Â 
 

or undertaking to work for a lengthy period (not one
time, but for 3 or 4 months, etc., or once more when called
upon by the Commissariat for Food, etc.)âand then the
bonus will be higher.

(In both cases make it a condition that they are obliged
not only to procure but also to thresh, and to carry the grain
into barns, and to erect barns or half-sheds, etc.)

Comrade Sklyansky

I am enclosing herewith Comrade Vorovskyâs letter, with
documents attached to it (registered in the Managing
Department of the C.P.C. 16. VIII. 1918 as No.Â 2509), and
I ask you to pay the most serious attention to the abuse and
crime revealed
here.[1]

It is necessary to appoint a very limited number of the
most reliable and experienced comrades (if possible, not
more than two or three), including one from the
Extraordinary Commission, to carry out through such a secret
commission of inquiry the strictest investigation, at first in
absolute secrecy, in order
(1) to discover the usual manner
in which business is conducted in the institution concerned,
(2) to trace the connections of the counter-revolutionary
criminals and
(3) to arrest all of them, allowing none to
escape.

Report to me regularly on fulfilment.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee
of the C.P.S.U. does not have the letter from Vorovsky, or its
enclosures, or any other material that would make it possible
to establish the precise nature of the abuses referred to. Since
Leninâs letter was addressed to Sklyansky, member of the Board
of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Military Affairs, it may be
presumed that the reference is to abuses in one of the military
departments.

A 500âpood tank-car of petrol is being dispatched to
you today, but why do you evade the very important

  Â  

questions: how much grain has been collected, how much
delivered? Further, it is absolutely essential to sweep clean of all
grain surpluses first one volost, and to give that volost a
big bonus. We shall not grudge money to help the poor
and middle peasants, if they are helping the hungry.

Minkin

It is stupid to ask whether a Peopleâs Commissar for
Finance, and one of a single region at that, can
countermand my order. If that order is not carried out, I shall have
the guilty persons prosecuted. Leave the company of Letts
in Penza for the time being until the suppression in
Chembar. Tell all members of the Executive Committee and all
Communists that it is their duty ruthlessly to suppress
the kulaks and to confiscate all the grain of the insurgents.
Your inactivity and weakness is exasperating. I demand
detailed reports on the fulfilment of all my orders and
especially on the measures of suppression and
confiscation.[1]

[2]
Lenin sent this telegram in reply to A.Â Y. Minkin, Chairman
of the Penza Gubernia Executive Committee, who asked whether
it was necessary to comply with the order of A.Â I. Potyaev,
Peopleâs Commissar for Finance of the Northern Region, to the
Chief of the Stationery Office in Penza that the unloading of the
Stationery Officeâs train should be held up, contrary to Leninâs
order dated August 16, 1918.

The Left Socialist-Revolutionariesâ revolt in Chembar, an
uyezd town in Penza Gubernia, mentioned in the telegram,
broke out on the night of August 18. On AugustÂ 20, the revolt
was put down by a detachment of Lettish riflemen and Red Army
men, who had arrived from Penza.

 Copy to the Gubernia Committee of the Communists

I am extremely indignant that there has been absolutely
nothing definite from you as to what serious measures have
at last been carried out by you for ruthless suppression
of the kulaks of five volosts and confiscation of their grain.
Your inactivity is criminal. All efforts should be
concentrated on a single volost which should be swept clean of
all grain surpluses. Telegraph fulfilment.

 Copy to Vatsetis

Regarding your military proposals about forming
detachments of instructors, let the military themselves decide this,
I am no judge. I only know of the special need of having
our own instructors for the workersâ army in view of the
complete unreliability of the officers. As regards a monetary
award, I agree and will support and put through your
decision.[1] It should not be made public.

Comrade Chicherin,

The bearer, Comrade Latukka, is a Finnish
Social-Democrat, who was a great help to us when we were in hiding
in
Finland.[1] He should now be given every possible
assistance. He would like to go to Switzerland.

Please have a talk with him and help him in realising
his wish and find a place for him at the Embassy. He is a
journalist.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin lived at the house of Latukka in Vyborg from September
17 (30) to October 7 (20), 1917, after the July events, when he
went into hiding to avoid persecution by the bourgeois
Provisional Government.

Gorbunov

It is superfluous and silly of you, after going through
the papers, to write âfor attention of V.Â I.â (!??) ((that
is obvious anyway)) or âI would propose such and suchâ.
 

You should give the gist of the matter in three lines.
Otherwise there is no sense in your going through them.

20. VIII. 1918

Gubernia Food Committee
 Tambov

In Usman Uyezd, landownersâ grain has been harvested
from 7,000 dessiatines of sown area in Safonovo, Baryatino
and Novo-Nikolskoye volosts, and has been delivered to
the elevator. Telegraph immediately how many poods of
grain there are in this elevator, whether the guard is
reliable, why you are slow in dispatching grain to Moscow,
who is to blame for the scandalous delay, whether there are
Poor Peasantsâ
Committees[1] in Usman Uyezd and are they
reliable.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Poor Peasantsâ Committees were instituted by a decree of
the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on JuneÂ 11, 1918.
They played a tremendous part in the struggle against the kulaks
and in consolidating Soviet power in the countryside. They

 Â  

carried out strict accounting and distribution of grain and
agricultural implements. Already by the autumn of 1918 the Poor
Peasantsâ Committees, which played a historic role in the
socialist revolution, had successfully solved the tasks entrusted to them.
In this connection, and also in connection with the need âto
complete Soviet construction by the creation of a uniform
organisation of Soviets throughout the territory of the Soviet Republicâ,
the Extraordinary Sixth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, held
in November 1918, proposed the re-election of all volost and
village Soviets, putting direct responsibility for the conduct of the
elections on the Poor Peasantsâ Committees. In accordance with the
election instructions published by the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee on DecemberÂ 4, 1918, the Poor Peasantsâ
Committees were to wind up their activities after the election campaign
and hand over all their funds and functions to the newly-elected
Soviets.

 Saratov

The amount of surpluses mentioned by you is clearly
underestimated. Collect more accurate information.
Exemplary villages and volosts, i.e., those with the best

  Â  

organisation of the poor, should be singled out in order, first, to
determine without concealment the amount of grain
surpluses and, second, to award a big bonus to the volosts
which have cleaned out and delivered all grain surpluses
without exception. Pass this on to all food officials and
telegraph reply. Push on grain shipments.

Comrade Medvedev,

Comrade Bosh told me about your meeting at the front,
about the state of affairs at the front and about your
doubts. She said that you were sure Syzran could and should
be captured, but did not want to write here about it.

If this is so, you are in the wrong. Thatâs what a
commissar is forâto complain. Be sure to write (and telegraph)
to me about everything and more frequently.

There has not once been a line from you.

Thatâs too bad. It is not Party behaviour and is a failure
to fulfil your duty to the state! Itâs too bad, really.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

I do not understand how Minkin could refuse to carry out

I hope this is only a misunderstanding. I insist that at a
critical time of war all should work together harmoniously

secretary F.Â V. Veselovskaya, reported on a meeting of the

AugustÂ 19 (see this volume, DocumentÂ 158). At the meeting, in reply
to a decision of members of the Gubernia Committee to send a

uprising of the kulaks and to confiscate their grain, A.Â Y. Minkin,
Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee, declared that
he refused to carry out the decision.

Kolesov
 Tashkent

We know little about the Caucasus and Baku.
Information is unverified. Soviet power exists in the Northern
Caucasus. Its troops are cut off from Tsaritsyn, which is
besieged from the south by the Cossacks. The British have
landed in Baku and the situation there is unstable. The
Germans have agreed to guarantee there will be no offensive
against Baku if we drive out the British from there. How

  Â  

matters will turn out there is not known. As regards the
military aid, we do not know where it is. We think it is held
up near
Tsaritsyn.[1]


As regards ambassadors and consuls, we advise a waiting
attitude, keeping them under threefold surveillance and
arresting suspicious individuals who are in contact with
them.

We are considering and preparing some assistance for
you, but cannot promise anything for certain, for
everything depends on whether we shall be successful in driving
the British out of Baku or whether they succeed in capturing
a part of the Caspian coast.

of Kotlas and the preparation of explosives for the complete
demolition, if need be, of the Kotlas-Vyatka railway.
Second, and most important of all, for the most energetic
food operations in connection with the successful progress
being made in suppressing kulak revolts south of Vyatka,
with a view to ruthless elimination of the kulaks,
confiscation of all their grain and its transportation via Vologda
and Nizhni-Novgorod, as well as for consolidating the
organisation of the poor peasants.

Take fullest advantage of the fine weather. Demand a

forget we need grain quickly and all grain surpluses should
be swept up from at least one exemplary volost.

(if he is away, forward to Urbach)

I insist that you definitely come to an agreement with
Paikes, who is working splendidly and is rightly
demanding independence for the two uyezds. I very much fear
that you in Saratov are playing at collegiate methods at
a time when the work demands energy and prompt action
by responsible executives on the spot in the countryside
and not in the towns.

Telegraph me after your talk with Paikes.

Sereda, Peopleâs Commissar for Agriculture
 Yelets

If threshing on a mass scale is being held up, as you
telegraph, by the sowing and harvesting of oats, then it
should help matters to send out a large number of
threshing detachments. It would be extremely important to speed
up the business of supply by enlisting Moscow workers,
Organise this immediately without fail. We must show the
workers of Moscow clearly from their own mass experience
that only their participation makes for rapid progress
in food supply. Do this at once.

Comrade Altfater

How do matters stand as regards sending submarines to
the Volga and the Caspian Sea?

Is it true that we can send only old submarines?

How many of them are there?

When was the order given for them to be sent? What
in general has been done?

Lenin

Written on August 28, 1918



Comrade Altfater

You cannot confine yourself to such vaguenessââwe are
searchingâ (for your own property?? The names of the
âsearchersâ, the date they started searching, etc., should
be given to me by tomorrow).

âClearing up whether dispatch is possibleââthis too is
vague in the extreme.

Who gave the âclear upâ orders, and when? Please let
me know this tomorrow (30/8) precisely, officially.

The business of sending submarines brooks not a
minuteâs delay.

Kharlov, Peopleâs Commissar for Agriculture
 Petrovsk, Saratov Gubernia

If all forces in your uyezd have been mobilised, then
obviously you must ask for threshing detachments of workers
from here, for the harvesting of grain must be speeded up
many times over. Telegraph daily how many waggons are
being sent off, under what markings and where from.
Announce a big bonus for the volost that is the first to sweep
up all grain surpluses. Draw up lists by volosts of the
richest peasants, who are answerable with their lives for the
proper progress of the work to supply grain to the starving
capital cities.

Tsyurupa

I do not advise putting it that way just now (itâs
something in between an ultimatumâresignation of allâand
vacillation of all in the face of the resoluteness of one).
Better concentrate all efforts on Yelets-f Petrovsk+the best
of the other uyezds.

Send out some two thousand workers as threshers, say.

And a few days later, after receiving at least news that
so many hundred trucks are en route, raise the question
more firmly.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs letter was due to the following circumstances. On
August 24, 1918, in view of the grave food situation in the city,
the Moscow Soviet passed a decision allowing the working people
to bring into Moscow freely up to one-and-a-half poods of
foodstuffs for their own personal consumption. On AugustÂ 26, the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars considered a draft decree on
preferential conveyance of grain, the question of the decision of
the Moscow Soviet being left open.

While the question was under discussion, the decision of the
Moscow Soviet allowing one-and-a-half poods as baggage could
not but hinder the organisation of the campaign against the
black-marketeering bag-men and the regulation of the work of the
intercepting detachments. On AugustÂ 29, L.Â I. Ruzer, member of the
Board of the Food Commissariat, who was in charge of this work,
asked the Board to relieve him of the work of combating
bag-trading. Ruzer wrote in his statement that he could think of âno
more wordings for a single order in response to inquiries from

 Â  

the local areasâ. Tsyurupa, who was also opposed to the â
one-and-a-half poods systemâ, added a postscript: âNone of the Board
members nor the Board as a whole can think of wordings that Ruzer,
too, failed to find. Conclusion: the order of the Moscow Soviet
should he rescinded on approximately the following lines: the
C.P.C. is to adopt a decision at once and publish it; the decision
is to indicate the date on which the order of the Moscow Soviet
ceases to be effectiveâapproximately SeptemberÂ 15. A.Â Tsyurupa.â
(V.Â I. Lenin, Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 50, p. 447.)

At the top of Leninâs note, Tsyurupa wrote: âA reply to
Ruzerâs statement with my postscriptâ, and then the date: â29/VIII.â

By a decision of the C.P.C. dated SeptemberÂ 5, 1918, the
decision of the Moscow Soviet and a similar decision of the
Petrograd Soviet ceased to be effective on October 1, 1918.

Comrade Sereda,

Iâm very sorry you did not drop in. You should not
have listened to the âoverzealousâ
doctors.[2]

Why arenât things working out in Yelets Uyezd? This
worries me very much, and still more your âside-steppingâ
on this question. Clearly, things do not work out. From 19Â 
volosts with Poor Peasantsâ Committees, not one clear,
precise report!

Not one
Ï,[1]

how many trucks, in what period of time ?!!

In not one single volost (though there should be in 19)
have 3-5 intelligent workers from Petrograd (with 15â50
assistants from Moscow) been brought in. Nowhere are
there any indications that work is proceeding apace!

What is wrong? Please do reply. Appoint correspondents
for me in each volost, give them this letter of mine, and
let them all reply to me.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

[2]
Lenin wrote this letter when he was ill after being seriously
wounded on AugustÂ 30, 1918, by the Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist,
Fanny Kaplan.

In spite of the doctorsâ orders, only a few days after being
wounded, Lenin began to occupy himself with affairs of state.
On SeptemberÂ 16 the doctors allowed him to resume work. From
SeptemberÂ 23 to mid-October Lenin was recuperating at Gorki
near Moscow.

The letter mentions the harvesting of grain in Yelets Uyezd,
Orel Gubernia. On this subject see also this volume, Document
182.

The original bears the date â7.IX.1918â. But in the files of
the Council of Peopleâs Commissars there is a copy of this letter
on which in an unknown hand is written the date â6/IXâ and
the time of dispatch â21.10 hoursâ (Ts. G.A.O.R., USSR).
Moreover, on the night of SeptemberÂ 6, Tsyurupa informed
Zinoviev in Petrograd: âtoday Vladimir llyich... wrote a letterâ (
Petrogradskaya Pravda No.Â 194, SeptemberÂ 7, 1918). This gives
grounds for assuming that the letter was written on SeptemberÂ 6,
1918.

I am surprised and worried at the slowing down of
operations against Kazan, especially if it is true, as I have

  Â  

been informed, that you have every opportunity of
destroying the enemy by artillery. In my opinion, one must
not spare the city and put things off any longer, for
ruthless annihilation is essential once Kazan is said to be in
an iron
ring.[1]

Leninâs telegram was transmitted to Kazan at 6.54Â a.m. on
SeptemberÂ 10, 1918, and by 2Â p.m. units of the Red Army had

By circular

Your telegrams
received.[1]

It is impossible to confine oneself to general and vague
expressions, which too often conceal the complete failure
of the work. Accurate weekly figures are essential: first,
exactly what part of the grain surpluses has been
collected and delivered by which volosts; second, exactly how
many poods of grain have been delivered, and to which
elevators and granaries.

Without such data, all the rest is mere verbosity. Reply
more exactly.

18. IX. 1918

The bearer, Comrade Mikhail Nikolayevich
Sanayev,[1]

Chairman of the Sergach Uyezd Party Committee (and
member of the E.C.), has very interesting things to tell about
the class struggle in the countryside and the Poor Peasantsâ
Committees.

It is extremely important that such factual material
from the local areas should appear in the newspaper (there
is far too much of âgeneralitiesâ). Will you please take
down what the comrade says and publish it.

With comradely greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Evidently a slip of the pen: the person concerned was Mikhail
Ivanovich Sanayev.âEd.

Kamenev

Dear L.Â B.,

Get well quickly.

About âthe fine theory of manoeuvringâ.

All theories are good if they correspond to objective
reality.

But our reality has changed, for if Germany is defeated,
it becomes impossible to manoeuvre, for there are no
longer the two belligerents, between whom we were
manoeuvring!!

Attention.[1]

Britain would gobble us up, were it not forÂ 
... the Red Army.
 

I donât think we should start talks about revision of
Brest, as that now would be running ahead.... We must
wait and see.

Get well!
 Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

1/X. 1918

Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich,

Only this morning I heard the awful news. I cannot
travel to Moscow, but I should like, if only in a letter, to grip
your hand hard, very hard, to express my love and the
love of all of us for Vera Mikhailovna, and to give you at
least a little support, insofar as anyone can do so, in your
terrible grief. Take good care of your daughterâs health.
Once more, a strong, firm handshake.

Yours,
 V.Â Lenin

Comrade Joffe
 Berlin

We do not agree to sign the Turkish protocol until the
hand-over of Baku to our authorities is accepted, for

  Â  

without this clause there is every ground for suspecting secret
agreements with the Entente for handing Baku over to
them. We shall publish just
that.[1]

Sverdlov, Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was sent in connection with the proposal of Rifaat
Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador in Germany, for the signing of a
protocol regulating the military situation in the Caucasus. The
draft protocol Rifaat Pasha put forward provided for the
withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the Caucasus to the borders laid
down by the Brest, Treaty, but it lacked a clause directly
transferring to the Soviet authorities the territories evacuated by the
Turks.

The fears expressed in this telegram were justified. On OctoberÂ 
30, 1918, the Turkish Government signed the Mudross armistice
with the Entente countries, which contained a special clause about
Turkey agreeing to the occupation of Baku by the Entente powers.
In November 1918, in accordance with this agreement, the Turks
withdrew their troops from Baku and the city was occupied by
the British.

Lyd.Â Al. (and Krasin)

I am signing the telegram about oil, ships, etc., with
pleasure.


But I donât agree to sign that about
Mukhin.[1]

(1) Krasin writes that Mukhin concealed money from
Stalin. This he had no right to do, even if âon the
instructions of his (!!??) chiefsâ, for Stalin too is a chief, and a
higher one, too, though not âhisâ.

(2) It is wrong formally and impermissible generally to
decide this without asking Stalin (and Stalin is in
Moscow!!).

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Krasin asked Lenin to sign a telegram to the Tsaritsyn
Extraordinary Commission for them to set free N.Â Mukhin, an employee
of the Chief Oil Committee, who had been arrested, and allow
him to travel freely to Moscow. Krasin proposed sending a copy of
the telegram to Stalin in Tsaritsyn.

Will you please send to Berlin tomorrow, Friday, 12Â 
copies of my article against Kautsky from
Pravda[1] for

  Â  

Joffe, Berzin and Vorovsky, and the following brief letter
from me to them:

Dear Comrades,

I am very well aware of the shortcomings of my too
brief article against Kautsky. Nevertheless, it is necessary
for us, as quickly as possible, to take a stand, to express
our opinion. Will you please have it translated and published
as a leaflet.

Comrades Chicherin and Karakhan

Regarding the Note to Wilson, I think it should be sent.

Write it in detail, politely, but caustically, saying:
in any case we consider it our duty to propose peaceâeven
to governments of capitalists and multimillionairesâin
order to try to stop the bloodshed and to open the eyes of the
peoples.

The fall of Kazan, Simbirsk, Syzran and Samara has
obviously exploded such-and-such rumours....

Do the capitalists want some of the forests in the north,
part of Siberia, interest on 17Â thousand
millions?[2] If so,
then surely they wonât make a secret of it. We propose
to you: state outright, how
much[1]

?

Regarding the Brest
peaceâGermany will agree to withdraw her troops. Whatâs
the matter then? Do you want to replace the German troops
with your own troops?

And so on.

I suggest that you immediately draft such a Note, and
we shall discuss it
together.[3]
 

[[ 
 }} N.B.

Pravda wanted to publish my article against Kautsky
morning. Did you receive from Sverdlov my note
asking for 12Â copies to be sent to Joffe for Berzin and
Vorovsky, for them to publish as a leaflet? and to have these
dispatched Friday evening?


]] 

What news is there from
Litvinov?[4]

What has been done about publishing Japanese leaflets?

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. We can talk things over on the telephone.

[2]
Lenin is alluding to the debts of the tsarist and bourgeois
Provisional governments to the imperialists of Britain, France, the
U.S.A. and other countries. By a decree of the All-Russia
Central Executive Committee dated JanuaryÂ 21 (FebruaryÂ 3), 1918,
all foreign loans of the tsarist and Provisional governments were
annulled.

The Note to Woodrow Wilson, President of the U.S.A., was
dispatched on October 24, 1918 (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki

[4]

M.Â M. Litvinov, Plenipotentiary of the R.S.F.S.R. in Great
Britain, was arrested by the British Government as a hostage for Bruce
Lockhart, British Vice-Consul in Moscow, who was arrested on
SeptemberÂ 3, 1918, for counter-revolutionary activities against
the Soviet Republic. In October 1918 Litvinov was exchanged for
Lockhart and returned to Soviet Russia.

15/X. 1918

Comrade Berzin

Dear Comrade,

I have received from you odd copies, as always, of
foreign newspapers (canât you have someone make cuttings of
(a) everything about Russia;
(b) everything about the
socialist parties of all countries).

I see from them, incidentally, that Graber and Grimm
have stupidly and basely attacked Guilbeaux. How could
you see something bad in his taking the money? I donât
understand.

You canât censure a valuable comrade without formally
going into the matter!? Who of the Party members (
appointed by you) went into it? No one! Yet from Guilbeauxâs
information and from the decision of the Geneva
Commission it is as clear as clear can be that the case is in favour
of Guilbeaux.
 

N.B. Send me: Longuet, La politique internationale
du marxisme. Karl Marx et la France. Vandervelde,
LâEtat et le
socialisme[1]

and all similar pamphlets in
French, German, English and Italian, all, all, all!
Also: La Russie socialiste (socialistes-rÃ©volutionnaires de
gauche), see La Feuille =

(GenÃ¨ve),[4]
3.Â X.Â 1918.[2]

Pierre
Loti, Quelques aspects du vertige mondial, Paris (
Flammarion). Leon Frapie, Les contes de la guerre (ibid.).

I have just received from Sverdlov a set of your
publications (it would do no harm if you sent this set to me as
well).

Too little! Too little!! Too little!!!

Engage a group of translators and publish 10Â times as
much. Peluso can (and should)
write three small pamphlets
a week (on all subjects, compilations from our newspapersâ
you provide the themes
and a list of the articles suitable
for compilation). His article in Droit du
Peuple[3]

â(
Counter-Revolutionariesâ) is good.
Pay him well and publish
10Â times as much. (Translators must be engaged, in order
to publish in 4languages: French, German, English and
Italian.
You have nothing in the last two. Scandalous!
Scandalous!!)

You have plenty of money. (Send without fail an 
account of the sums you have spent.) We shall give more and
still more, in plenty. Write how much.

A 100Â times more must he published, in 4Â languages,
pamphlets of 4â8--16â32 pages. Engage people for this.

N.B.


Collect a set of Spartakusbund (I have seen No.Â 11, IX.
1918)[5] and republish the entire set in 4Â languages. Also
Junius and Liebknecht. Commission a history of the
struggle against social-chauvinism in Britain, France, Germany,

  Â  

Italy. Form groups for this purpose (Gorter, Balabanova+?
+??, etc.).

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. What is your optimism about revolutions in the
countries de lâEntente based on? Facts? Considerations? If
necessary, send in code, but write more precisely.

N.B.


If you are ill, undergo treatment seriously and do not
leave the sanatorium. Keep in touch by telephone, and send
your deputy for visits.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Apparently this refers to E.Â Vanderveldeâs pamphlet Le
Socialisme centre lâEtat, Paris, 1918.âEd.

[2]
I think the Left S.R.s have here lied terribly. It is necessary
at once to commission someone (Leiteisen even) to make a
compilation from Pravda and Izvestia
against the lies of the Left S.R.s (and
also from Znamya Trudovoi Kommuny and from Volya
Truda[6]).
âLenin

[3]
Droit du Peupleâa weekly, organ of the Social-Democratic
Party of Switzerland, and of the party branches in the canton
of Vaud and the city of Lausanne.âEd.
 



[4]
On October 3, 1918, the newspaper La Feuille reported the
publication of the book La Russie socialiste, which had been compiled
by Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.

La Feuilleâa daily newspaper published in Geneva from 1917
to 1920. While not formally the organ of any particular party,
its views were those of the Second International.





[6]
Znamya Trudovoi Kommuny (Banner of the Labour Commune)
âa newspaper, published originally, from July 26 to August 18,

 Â  

1918, under the title Znamya Borby (Banner of Struggle) as the
organ of a group of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. Later, from
August 21, it was the organ of the Party of Narodnik Communists,
a break-away from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The
newspaper ceased publication in November 1918, when an
extraordinary congress of the Party of Narodnik Communists passed
a resolution dissolving the party and merging it with the
R.C.P.(B.).

Volya Truda (The Will of Labour)âa newspaper, the organ
of the Party of Revolutionary Communism, which broke away
from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party in September 1918.
It appeared from SeptemberÂ 14 to DecemberÂ 4, 1918. From
December 29, 1918, the daily newspaper was replaced by a periodical with
the same title; it was published until October 1920, when the
Party of Revolutionary Communism merged with the R.C.P.(B.).





[5]
This refers to the illegally published âLettersâ of the Spartacus
group; twelve such letters were issued between September 1916
and October 1918.

Comrade Joffe,

Send me, please, the issue of Sozialistische

dictatorship.[1]

Such things should be sent immediately.

Dittoânewspaper cuttings (instead of the unreadable
summaries)âeverything relating to the split with the
social-chauvinists and Kautskyites (with a translation into
German from the Dutch and Scandinavian languages).

We ought to act as a bureau for ideological work of an
international character, but we are doing nothing!!

A hundred times more must be published. We have the
money. Engage translators. But we are doing nothing! It
is scandalous....

Please send this letter also to Vorovsky, and forward
the enclosure, please, to the proper
quarter.[2]

Dear Comrade Joffe,

I received your letter of 13.Â X after sending off a
letter to you.

I am not against continuing the âdiplomatisingâ. But
its importance has diminished. The whole point is
whether the Entente manages to land in force in the Black Sea.
I have long been talking to everyone everywhere about this
danger, and have said it clearly in the letter to the Central
Executive
Committee.[1] The radical difference from II.
1918 is that at that time we had a chance to win time by
giving away territory. Now there is no such chance.

Mit besten GrÃ¼ssen,
 Ihr Lenin

Entente countries extending intervention against the Soviet

Comrade Gorbunov,

I earnestly request you to speed up as much as possible
the Science and Technology Departmentâs findings in
regard to the Radio Laboratory. It is extremely urgent. Drop
me a line when its findings are
ready.[1]

Greetings,
 Lenin

This refers to the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory, which was
founded in 1918 by M.Â A. Bonch-Bruyevich and V.Â M.

established after the October Revolution. Lenin took a personal interest
in the work of the Radio Laboratory and gave it repeated support.

Comrade Berzin

Dear ComradeÂ B.,

Whatâs this story about Herzogâs
expulsion?[1]


I think we should speak in his favour. Donât forget, the
people who have expelled him are scoundrels, opportunists.

Write about this.

I hope you have wound up the Guilbeaux âaffairâ in the
sense of having fully recognised him as rehabilitated.
Give him my regards. Where is he?

When will the French edition of The State and
Revolution
appear?[2] Have I time to write a preface against
Vandervelde?

Send me: Vandervelde, Le Socialisme contre lâEtat; La
Belgique envahie et le Socialisme international; Trois
aspects de la revolution russe. All three are published by
Berger-Levrault, Paris, 5â7, rue des Beaux-Arts.

Please collect all pamphlets of this kind (English, French,
Italian, German).

Send information about France more often. What goes
on there? How are things there?

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

1/XI.

Dear Berzin,

I have received a lot of books from you. Many thanks.

I hear that all are at loggerheads over there. We shall
take Shklovsky and Zalkind.

In case of anything, write; I shall sign your orders (to
your subordinates), so that they will not dare quarrel and
will strictly carry out your orders.

Stay in bed and follow the treatment strictly; you ought
to be living not in Berne, but in the mountains in the
sunshine, in some place where there is a telephone and a
railway, and you should send a secretary to Berne and people
should travel to you.

In the German translation of The State and Revolution
an unfortunate error has crept in: the postscript is not
dated. Yet the whole point is to show that the postscript
was written after the October Revolution. Namely: 30.
XI. 1917. Could not a correction slip be pasted in?




Some capable comrades are on their way to you. Do not
grudge money, particularly through them, for propaganda
in France.

All the very best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

N.B. 

Prepare everything for the eventuality that the Entente
will force Switzerland to deport you. Bereit
sein!![1]

P.S. If the French translation of The State and
Revolution is ready, put it out at once, but in the publisherâs
preface criticise both Kautsky and Vandervelde (Le
Socialisme contre lâEtat), because Vandervelde slurred over,
concealed, distorted everything of importance about the state.

I am sending about half a pamphlet against Kautsky.
Will you please have it translated as quickly as possible
and let me know by telegram: Antikautsky is being

  Â  

translated into German, French or Italian. Otherwise Iâll have
it done here.

I hope you sent Staat und Revolution to Berlin? The
more the better!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On NovemberÂ 12, 1918, the Swiss Government, yielding to
pressure from the Entente countries, expelled from Switzerland the
staff of the Embassy of the R.S.F.S.R. headed by Berzin.

I greet the valiant Red Army troops who captured Izhevsk.
Congratulations on the anniversary of the revolution. Long
live the socialist Red
Army![1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin attached great importance to the suppression of the
whiteguard-S.R. revolt in Izhevsk and the liberation of the town. At
the beginning of November 1918, in a talk with S.Â I. Gusev,
member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 2nd Army, he
expressed the hope that Izhevsk would be liberated by the first
anniversary of the October Revolution, and asked that this
message should be transmitted to the Red Army men. On NovemberÂ 
7, troops of the division commanded by V.Â M. Azin stormed and
captured the town and the small arms factory.

Leninâs telegram is in reply to the report on the liberation of
Izhevsk received from the Eastern Front. It was read out to the Red
Army men who took part in the liberation of the town.

Comrade Weissbrot,

You happen to be in
Vienna....[1]

I hope you will do
everything you can to find the Lefts. Perhaps Strasser (Josef
Strasser) will help find them, although he himself,
probably, is
not...[2]

to help them.

Write more often, with every courier.

If possible (if you have good connections, etc.) try to
rescue my library from Poronin
(Galizien)[3]

:

I left it there
at the dacha with my things in 1914, I had to pay a
balance of 50 kronen; now I would give 100,000,000 to have
the library rescued. But
thatÂ ...[4]

is a personal
matter.[5]

The important thing is to find the Lefts in Vienna and
to help them in every way. Iâm afraid you wonât succeed
in this owing to the lack of connections, but try to do
everything possible.

Write.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

The books preserved from Leninâs library in Poronin as well as
archive materials (the Cracow-Poronin archives) were handed
over to the Soviet Union after Leninâs death. The first batch of
materials was received in 1924, and some of the books belonging
to Lenin in 1933. Twelve of Leninâs books, kept in the Bydgoszcz
library, were handed over to the Soviet Army in 1945 as a token
of gratitude for the liberation of the town from the German
occupationists. A large batch of materials from the Cracow-Poronin
archives, discovered by archivists of the Polish Peopleâs
Republic, was received in 1951. A particularly large number of
valuable documents were handed over-to the Central Committee of the
C.P.S.U. by the Polish United Workersâ Party in 1954.
Altogether, in 1951 and 1954, over a thousand new documents were
handed over to the U.S.S.R. from Poland.

I think there has been enough celebrating. It is
ludicrous!
 

We shall âcelebrateâ 14.Â XII by a nice, correct,
skilful, rapid merger of the Co-operative Bank with the State
Bank.

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note is Leninâs reply to an inquiry asking his opinion about
the proposal of the Manager of the Northern Regional Branch of
the National (State) Bank to celebrate December 14âthe
anniversary of the promulgation of the decree nationalising private banks.

Technical Committee
 Northern Economic Council
 Petrograd

I severely reprimand you for procrastination and
non-fulfilment of the directive of the Science and Technology
Department of the Supreme Economic Council for the
delivery of materials to the Central Science and Technology
Laboratory of the Military Department. I demand that the
materials be issued immediately and that every assistance
be given in accelerating the experiments. Report
fulfilment.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was in response to a complaint Lenin received from
N.Â P. Gorbunov, head of the Science and Technology
Department of the Supreme Economic Council, that the Technical
Committee of the Economic Council of the Northern Area was
holding up fulfilment of orders from the Central Science and
Technology Laboratory of the Military Department. At the top of the
document received from Gorbunov, Lenin wrote an instruction to the
secretary: =

âPhone Gorbunov and tell him to send today the exact
documents concerning the half-monthâs delay and copies of papers
from Amosov (head of the Technical Committee of the Economic
Council of the Northern Area.âEd.). Without the documents
the complaint has no weight. Lenin.â On the left-hand side there
is an additional note: âReprimand sent. Lenin.â =

Today I severely reprimanded the Technical Committee
of the Northern Economic Council for procrastination.
Explain to the Economic Council of the Northern Area that

  Â  

its duty is to expedite experiments and ensure speedy
fulfilment of the assignments of the Science and Technology
Department of the Supreme Economic Council. If the
document from the Technical Committee dated NovemberÂ 
13, No.Â 646, is not merely a case of procrastination and
stupidity, but malicious sabotage, then I demand an
investigation and the arrest of those guilty.

I am entirely in sympathy with your plan to release
prisoners of war, but only a few at a time and exclusively those
who have really been won over by our propaganda. Telegraph
me at once, if necessary in code, how many prisoners you
have, of what nationality, and how many of them have been
propagandised.

A very detailed and caustic reply must be drawn up.
Do we recognise the German Government? Is it recognised
by all the Councils of Deputies in Germany? If it is, then
we, too, recognise it.

âNot to influenceâ? By word of mouth, by the press?

  Â  

From the viewpoint of democracy or dictatorship? Please
clarify, but we declare that if they demand in the form
of an ultimatum that we do not carry on agitation, we shall
not break with them on that account.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this directive to Chicherin in connection with a
radio-telegram from the German Government, which was set up on
November 10, 1918, and consisted mainly of Right-wing
Social-Democrats and Centrists. In its radio-telegram of November 21,
1918, the German Government requested the Soviet Government
to issue a statement about its recognition and the obligation âto
refrain from exerting any influence on the German population
for the purpose of forming a different governmentâ.

Leninâs instructions were reflected in the Note to the German
Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated November 25, 1918, which was
signed by G.Â V. Chicherin (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR,
Vol.Â I, 1957, pp. 576â77).

I am for using this palace as a museum. Get Sverdlovâs
written
consent.[1]

Lenin


26/XI.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this instruction on a memo from the Department
of Museums and Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity
of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education, sent to the Managing
Department of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on November
26, 1918, asking that a number of premises of the Grand Palace
in the Kremlin be allocated for the requirements of the state
museums.

On December 12, 1918, the C.P.C. decreed âthat, measures
be taken to use premises of the Grand Palace for a museum, in
particular for presenting a historic picture of the life of the tsarsâ.

Comrade Volin, Chairman of the Orel Gubernia Executive
Committee and Gubernia Party Committee, on the line:

I
have just received a telegram from Surazh as follows: âOn
NovemberÂ 29, a congress of German Councils in the Ukraine is taking
place at Gomel. It is essential to send representatives. We have sent the
head of the Information Department, and others. We are conducting
talks with a big German Council in the Ukraine and are enlisting in
the Red Army volunteers from the German army. Send directives
for talks to our representatives in the Ukraine. Our representatives
have been guaranteed safety, they are under German protection. The
temper of the German army is thoroughly Bolshevik.â
I decided today
to send to Gomel a Communist, Chairman of the Soviet, and a
German, the Communist Meyer, from the International Detachment.
Should the Chairman of the Orel Soviet only make a speech of
greetings or can he take upon himself a political mission? I am asking you
for a directive. If you know of this congress and have sent your
representatives, then perhaps our delegation is not necessary.
 

Lenin: I know nothing about this congress. I advise you
to get in touch immediately with the Ukrainian Communists
and with their Central Committee via Kursk. The reports
about the majority of the German Councils being on the
side of the Bolsheviks must be carefully verified. If this is
not the case, then it is necessary at the congress to deliver
a detailed, well-substantiated, principled speech about
Bolshevism and its tasks. If, however, the German soldiers
are already Bolsheviks or Spartacists, then we must propose
to them an immediate alliance with us for the speediest
restoration of Soviet power in the Ukraine and for the
arrest not only of whiteguards, but also of the supporters of
the Rada. In any case people must be sent to the congress
who are capable of accurately reporting back all the
discussions and resolutions.

If it is already too late to send new representatives to
the congress, then try to wire my note through to the
people you have already sent. I await a reply.

Volin:
Vladimir Ilyich, I informed you that I decided to send
the Chairman of the Soviet to Gomel. He is leaving tonight. That
was why I asked for your directive. Simultaneously with this I shall
try to get in touch with Kursk.

Lenin: I am very glad that you are sending the chairman
to the congress. I hope you are satisfied with my
suggestions. Arrange for me to get information about each day
of the
congress.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs doubts about the correctness of the reports that most of
the Councils of German soldiers in the Ukraine had adopted a
Bolshevik stand were fully justified. The All-Ukraine Congress of
Councils of German Soldiers, held in Kiev on December 13, 1918,
was influenced by German opportunists and did not adopt any
political resolution. The Congress decided to come to an agreement
with Petlyuraâs bands and to surrender Kiev to them without a
fight in exchange for the free passage of westward-bound German
troop trains.

Comrade Zinoviev,

Comrade Karl Moor, a Swiss, has sent me a long letter
asking for Palchinsky to be set free on the grounds that he
is a prominent technician and organiser, author of many
books, etc. I have heard and read about Palchinsky as
having been a speculator, etc., during Kerenskyâs time.

But I do not know whether there is now any evidence
against Palchinsky? Of what kind? Is it serious? Why
has the amnesty law not been applied to
him?[2]

If he is a scientist, a writer, could he notâif there are
serious charges against himâbe given special treatment
(for example, house arrest, a laboratory, etc.).

Please reply to me immediately in writing.

Dear V.Â D.,

I am sending you a pamphlet on the implementation of
laws. Think of a title that would be most clear, striking
and resounding.
 

And publish it as quickly as
possible.[1]

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a pamphlet containing the decree on revolutionary
legality adopted by the Extraordinary Sixth All-Russia Congress
of Soviets on November 8, 1918. In this decree the Congress called
on âall citizens of the Republic, all bodies, all officials of the
Soviet authorities, to strictly observe the laws of the R.S.F.S.R.,
and the decisions, regulations and instructions issued by the
central authoritiesâ. All departures from the laws, caused by the
conditions of the struggle against counter-revolution, were to be
kept within strictly defined limits. The decree outlined measures
for waging a determined fight against bureaucracy and red tape
in Soviet offices.

12. XII. 1918

Dear Comrade Shlyapnikov,

I am taking this opportunity to send you greetings and
materials for the
investigation.[2] Think it over thoroughly
in advance and discuss it with 2 or 3 of
the most reliable
members of the Cheka, and catch the scoundrels named
here without fail. Spare no effort to catch and shoot the

  Â  

Astrakhan profiteers and bribe-takers. This riffraff must be
dealt with in such a way that everyone will remember
it for years to come.

The materials, I have been told, come from an honest
tradesman who has remained here.

Regarding your requests and commissions, I have
phoned, asked and repeated
them.[1]

I hope that partâand
the most substantial partâwill be met. The whole, of
course, is beyond our resources.

Telegraph what items among those outstanding are most
urgently required.

Do your utmost to carry out repairs and increase the
carrying capacity of the Astrakhan railway line.

What success has been achieved at sea? With our fleet?
With the base near
Kizlyar?[3]

Write!

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

munitions to Astrakhan.âEd.

Trotsky at his present whereabouts

Perm is in a dangerous
plight.[3] I consider it essential
to send reinforcements. Petrograd can provide regiments

  Â  

of Soviet poor peasants, there are two of them there, or
others, at the direction of the Revolutionary Military
Council. We propose that you give the appropriate
directives as quickly as possible. We propose that you point
out to the Revolutionary Military
Council[1]

the
tremendous importance of Kizel District of Perm which supplies
coal to the factories and the entire railway. The loss of
Kizel will halt traffic.

 or present whereabouts

News from around Perm is extremely alarming. Danger
threatens it. I am afraid we forgot about the Urals. Bring
pressure to bear on Vatsetis without fail and check
whether he is sufficiently energetically providing
reinforcements for Perm and the Urals. Lashevich told Zinoviev
that only blooded units should be sent.

[3]
Towards the end of November 1918, Kolchakâs troops, possessing
considerable superiority in strength, launched an offensive against
the 3rd Army of the Eastern Front with the aim of uniting with
the interventionist troops in the north. After heavy defensive
battles, the 3rd Army was forced to abandon a considerable

 Â  

territory. The causes for the defeat were: poor supply of clothing, food
and ammunition to the army units, lack of the necessary reserves,
contamination of some army units by counter-revolutionary
elements owing to the violation of the class principle in the
formation of units, shortcomings in the army leadership on the part of
the commander, M.Â M. Lashevich, and the Revolutionary Military
Council of the army.

On this subject see also this volume, DocumentÂ 242.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The instruction to G.Â I. Petrovsky, Peopleâs Commissar for
Internal Affairs, was written by Lenin on a telegram he received
on December 16, 1918, from peasants of Budilovo village (Yaroslavl
Gubernia) complaining against the Chairman of the local Poor
Peasantsâ Committee who had confiscated grain from them although
they had no surpluses. They asked protection of Lenin, as
âhead of the peasant governmentâ.

Sverdlov,
 for your information

Yesterday, 15/XII, Bukharin told me that, as testified
by Yem. Yaroslavsky, Spiridonova is conducting party
propaganda.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs note to Sverdlov was written on a telegram from N.Â N.
Kuzmin, Military Commissar of the 6thÂ Army, who had reported
that Left Socialist-Revolutionary agitation was being conducted
among the troops of the Northern Front, as a result of which
discipline in some units was deteriorating.

As regards Spiridonova, a leader of the Left Socialistâ
Revolutionary Party, Leninâs note probably refers to her speeches at
outdoor and indoor meetings, against Soviet power, against the
Bolsheviks. On FebruaryÂ 24, 1919, the Moscow Revolutionary
Tribunal examined the case of Maria Spiridonova, who was accused
of counter-revolutionary agitation and slander against Soviet
power. The charges against Spiridonova were proved at the trial,
but in view of the âmorbidly hysterical state of the accusedâ,
the tribunal decided âto isolate Maria Spiridonova from political
and social activity for one year by confining her in a sanatorium
and affording her an opportunity for healthy physical and mental
labourâ (Pravda No.Â 43, February 25, 1919).

21. XII. 1918

To the Vecheka

Comrade Dzerzhinsky,

I enclose a complaint.

Please find out without fail who is responsible for this
red tape (no reply from 3.XII to 20. XIII! Yet the decree
is dated 21. XI!!!) and
prosecute.[1] Such a disgraceful thing

  Â  

must not be allowed to go unpunished. Apparently there
are saboteurs in the office.

Further, you must appoint a person to take charge of
the speedy, immediate transfer of the warehouses.

Report what you have done.

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the transfer to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food
of warehouses of industrial and handicraft products, which
were at the disposal of the All-Russia Extraordinary
Commission (Vecheka). The transfer was to have been made
in pursuance of the decree on the organisation of supplies
for the population adopted by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
on NovemberÂ 21, 1918. On DecemberÂ 3, 1918, the Food
Commissariat asked the Vecheka to turn over the warehouses to the Chief
Board for Distribution of Products, but up to December 20 this
request remained without reply. On DecemberÂ 20, the Food
Commissariat applied to the Council of Defence concerning this
matter.

Bulatov, Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee
 Tver

I authorise you to investigate the enclosed complaint
and report the result to me as soon as possible.

Report essentials by telegraph (âre the case of the
schoolteacher Ivanovaâ).

Particularly important: check the statement that in the
Poor Peasantsâ Committee there are former and present
elements of the Black Hundreds: Teterin, Skvortsov,
Kozlov, Baskakov.

Start the check discreetly to prevent premature
publicity and be able to catch them red-handed and expose them
completely.

Should the accusation prove to be true, these Black
Hundreders must be kicked out publicly and a leaflet about
the affair promulgated throughout the volost and uyezd,
for the population must be taught that well-founded
complaints are of great significance and lead to important
results.

Telegraph me: âLetter received, directive will be carried
outâ, and then about the progress of the investigation.

Send the results by letter, the exact findings of the
investigation and the measures taken.
 

I think that as Chairman of the Gubernia Executive
Committee you need no special mandate from me for such
a simple case. If need be, I will send it.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.

N.B. Enclosed herewith is V.Â S. Ivanovaâs
complaint.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

D.Â A. Bulatov wired Lenin on December 26, 1918: âLetter
received. Directive will be carried out.â In a telegram on December
28, 1918, Bulatov reported that Teterin, a member of the
Pervitino Poor Peasantsâ Committee, had been relieved of his post as
being a former gendarme, but the other members of the

 Â  

committee had been left in their posts since the accusations against them
were unproven. On DecemberÂ 31 Bulatov sent Lenin a detailed
letter on this matter.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his telegram to Lenin and to the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic dated December 20, 1918, Trotsky,
commenting on the apprehensions of Commander-in-Chief Vatsetis
regarding fraternisation, wrote of its significance, particularly on
the Northern Front, where there were American, British and French
troops. At the same time, in order to put a stop to enemy
agitation among Red Army men and to prevent the weakening of the
fighting efficiency of the Red Army units, the telegram proposed
that fraternisation should be carried out in an organised manner
under the surveillance and control of responsible functionaries,
primarily political commissars.

hand over his library to the local workersâ reading-room,
and this seems to me
fair.[1]

30. XII. 1918

Please receive the bearer, Comrade Prokofiev. His
request for the requisitioning of Surkovâs library for a district
of 40,000 people is, in my opinion, correct. Surkov,
perhaps, should retain certain rights to use it? Please send
me a copy of your decision on this question, and help the
Rodniki comrades to expand their library. Can they not be
sent one of the libraries requisitioned from the landowners?
Please inform me about this as
well.[2]

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of requisitioning Surkovâs library was discussed on
December 27, 1918, at an enlarged sitting of the Executive
Committee, the Extraordinary Commission and the Committee of the
R.C.P.(B.) of the town of Rodniki. Its decision noted that âthe books
in Citizen Surkovâs library, which are of social value, are shut away
and unread at a time when there is an immense lack of books for
the enlightenment of broad masses of workers and peasantsâ, and
that since a library was being formed in Rodniki âthe
requisitioned books will be of tremendous benefit as public propertyâ. In
order to give Lenin fuller information on this question, the

 Â  

meeting decided to send A.Â N. Prokofiev, secretary of the local
Cheka, to see him.

Lenin received Prokofiev and after a talk with him wrote his
letter to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education.





[2]
In reply to Leninâs letter, V.Â Y. Bryusov, head of the Library
Section of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education, informed
him on January 2, 1919, that A.Â N. Prokofiev had been received
and heard out in the Library Section. Bryusov wrote that,
according to existing rules, the requisitioning of libraries could be
permitted only with the knowledge and consent of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Education, in order that, when requisitioning
takes place, the interests of the state as a whole should be taken
into accountâprimarily the requirements of the large state
libraries: the libraries of the Rumyantsev Museum (now the State
Library of the U.S.S.R., named after Lenin), the Historical
Museum, the Socialist Academy, the universities, and others. In
view of this Prokofiev was asked to submit an inventory of the
requisitioned library.

On receipt of Bryusovâs memo, Lenin wrote a letter to
Prokofiev (see this volume, Document 235).

1) When will the pamphlet IssueÂ VI. Materials on Land
Reform be published?

2) The remaining issues should be speeded
up.[1]
    (This publication is extremely important.)

3) I think at least half a page should be added clearly
setting forth the policy of the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Agriculture (otherwise, there is the danger that the
pamphlet, âin going among the peopleâ, will muddle them up).

More and more such leaflets (with translations into

to the south, to the Ukraine, to meet the

I have given orders for trucks to be dispatched to
Petrograd from Moscow and from Nizhni-Novgorod by
passenger trains. See to it. If you were caught napping during
the hold-up a month ago and failed to lodge a
complaint in time, then you can blame yourself also for not
having taken steps to verify the speed of trucks after our

Comrade Prokofiev,

I am sending you Bryusovâs
letter.[1] Please return it
to me with information as to how you settled the question
of Surkovâs library.

I hope, nevertheless, you will do everything possible to
give Surkov some satisfaction: for example, the right to
use it, and so forth.

It appears you should have approached the Library
Section of the Extra-Mural Department. I will ask them to
take care of
you.[2]

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (N.Â Lenin)

Surkovâs library came under the control of the Rodniki
Department of Education on JanuaryÂ 10, 1919, some of the books being
returned to the original owner. Lists of the books requisitioned or
returned to Surkov were sent to Lenin and to the Library Section
of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education on FebruaryÂ 3.

 or present whereabouts

Am very uneasy about whether you are not giving too
much attention to the Ukraine to the detriment of the
general strategic task, on which Vatsetis insists and which
consists in a speedy, determined and general offensive
against Krasnov. I am very much afraid that we are being
late with this and that the recent successes of the
Krasnovites near Tsaritsyn will again lead to the postponement
of our offensive and to our missing the right moment. The
initiative for serious operations is escaping from us, both
at Astrakhan and on the Caspian Sea, as well as at
Tsaritsyn and in the east. Vatsetis is for a speedy general
offensive against Krasnov, but Vatsetis, apparently, is not
able to cope with red tape and the separatism of the
Ukrainians and other regionalists. Should you not concentrate
wholly on hastening and carrying through a general
offensive against Krasnov?

[1]
Written by Lenin following a conversation with F.Â F. Obraztsov
a peasant from Vasyutino village, Lopatinsk Volost, Vesyegonsk
Uyezd, Tver Gubernia, who had been sent to Lenin by village
Communists to solicit help in building a village Peopleâs House
to replace one that was destroyed by fire at the end of 1917.

On JanuaryÂ 18, 1919, after Obraztsovâs return home, the
local newspaper, Izvestia of the Vesyegonsk Soviet of Workersâ,
Peasantsâ and Red Army Deputies, published an article about
his reception by Lenin under the heading âA Visit to Comrade

 Â  

Leninâ. In it Obraztsov related that his talk with Lenin had dealt
chiefly with the policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet
Government towards the poor and middle peasantry. In concluding the
article, Obraztsov wrote: âComrade peasants of Vesyegonsk Uyezd!
Believe me who saw with my own eyes that there, at the top, our
common cause is being administered not by officials or
bureaucrats, but by our own, ordinary comrades, who rightly call
themselves the Workersâ and Peasantsâ Government. Let us hearken
to their voice. They are working for us and our children. Let us
help them with all we can in their difficult work. Then we shall
all the sooner see a golden age for us. Comrades! I hope that it is
together with you all that I say loudly: âLong live the leader of the
proletariat and protector of the poor, our friend and brother
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin!!!ââ

Gusev
 Revolutionary Military Council, Eastern Front
 Arzamas

Inform the Revolutionary Committee in Ufa for their
guidance that negotiations must be begun immediately
with the Socialist-Revolutionaries who are proposing
negotiations, after taking all precautions against attempts at
provocations and for safeguarding the front, while at the
same time guaranteeing absolute personal immunity to the
envoys from the Socialist-Revolutionaries. At the talks it
is to be stated clearly straight away that there can be no
question of any change in the Soviet Constitution, because
Soviet power, being the power of the exploited classes
for suppressing the exploiters, has definitely proved its
necessity for securing victory over the bourgeoisie, and
the Soviet movement is now spreading to all countries of
the world.
 

Continually report directly to us on the whole course
of the negotiations, and on the participants of both
sides.[2]

Lenin, 
Sverdlov[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The last sentence of the telegram and the signatures are in
Sverdlovâs handwriting.âEd.
 



[2]
This telegram was sent in reply to an inquiry from the Ufa
Revolutionary Committee to whom the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries
had made a proposal to begin negotiations for joint action against
Kolchak.

The talks with the Ufa Right Socialist-Revolutionaries were
held during January-February 1919 in Ufa and Moscow.

At the end of February, the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee adopted a resolution on the attitude towards the Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries. In view of the positive results of the
talks and the fact that on February 8, 1919, the party conference
of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries declared itself opposed to
an armed struggle against Soviet power and to foreign intervention
in Russiaâs affairs, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
passed a decision to give to the groups of Right Socialistâ
Revolutionaries which adopted this stand the right âto participate in

Shlyapnikov, Gubernia Executive Committee
 Gubernia Committee of the Party of Communists


Astrakhan[1]


A conflict with the Party Committee is inadmissible.
Take all steps to ensure proper teamwork. All Party
members, irrespective of the post they occupy, must belong to
the local organisation. The Party Committee should not
interfere in the work of institutions directly subordinated to
the centre. It has the right only to put its views before the
Central Committee. All local work is directed by the Party
centre. Intervention is possible from within or if there is a
special instruction of the C.C. on some concrete question.
Similar relations should be established with the Gubernia
Executive Committee. Only in the event of non-fulfilment of
decrees or of work against the decisions of the central
authority is direct intervention possible. Great tact is essential,
then conflicts will be impossible. General talk about the
need for a radical purge in military institutions is of no

  Â  

value. We shall lake note of concrete references to
particular facts or persons.

On December 25, 1918, Kolchakâs troops occupied Perm. Having
examined the letter from the Urals Regional Party Committee on
the causes of the reverses of the 3rd Army, the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
set up a Committee of Inquiry consisting of J.Â V. Stalin and
F.Â E. Dzerzhinsky, which visited the 3rd Army early in January
1919.

Leninâs directive was written in connection with a letter from
Stalin and Dzerzhinsky in which they reported on the opening
of the investigation and pointed out that in order to prevent the
rapid advance of the enemy, it was essential to send urgently three
reliable regiments to reinforce the 3rdÂ Army.

 Petrograd

From my talks with Ravich and Kalinin, and from
Shadurskayaâs telegram I gather that nine-tenths of the top
machinery of government in Petrograd are engaged in doing
nothing. I advise you to think over and urgently carry out
a reorganisation, by transferring tens, if not hundreds, of
the best people to actual control of transport, with you
yourself heading the actual control of the food trains. Otherwise
there is no salvation.

complained that the Gavrilov Posad Extraordinary Commission had
confiscated 16 poods of oats from them, and asked for orders to
be given for their return.

Lenin wrote this instruction to the secretary on a telegram to the

of a district in Tula Gubernia, who reported on the progress of
snow clearing on the railway, and gave factual data on the
number of workers and carts engaged in this work.

Tsyurupa:

In any case we must prepare for, announce and hold
Starving Childrenâs Week.

Perhaps it should be combined with grain requisitioning
and a special mobilisation of the Poor Peasantsâ Committees.

Perhaps something more could be done for the children?

It should be.

I enclose this about meat: please return it to me as
quickly as possible with the Food Commissariatâs brief
comment.[2]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs directives to Tsyurupa were written on the memorandum
of the Education Commissariatâs Inter-Departmental Commission
for the Purchase of Food for the Children of Moscow and
Petrograd. The memorandum outlined measures for the better food
provision of the children, specifically, the organisation and
holding of a Starving Childrenâs Week for obtaining produce in
rural localities in exchange for commodities, and for delivery of
this produce to the towns.

Return this to me, please, after writing your opinion.

I think it is an absolute scandal that Vatsetis assigned
the three regiments to Narva. Cancel it!!

Leninâs instruction to Trotsky was written on the text of a report
from Stalin and Dzerzhinsky giving the reasons for the fall of
Perm. The report stated that the three regiments intended as
reinforcements for the 3rd Army had been reassigned to
Narva.

It would be good if you were to give for the press (if only

Lenin probably refers to a letter dated January 19, 1919, from

23. I. 1919

Comrade Lander,

I draw your attention to the decision adopted today in
the C.P.C.: you are directed to check before Saturday (by
the Saturday sitting of the C.P.C.) fulfilment by
Prodfaztop[1]

(or other bodies of the Food Commissariat) of the
decree of the C.P.C. dated JanuaryÂ 18, 1919;

âto ascertain the reasons for procrastination;

âto discover the people who are to
blame.[2]

Appoint an intelligent Communist inspector, be sure to
add to him a worker, and make haste, so that they begin
work Friday morning (if no worker is available, start
without him and let him join in later).

I consider the matter important; they should supply
information the same day. It is necessary to check the business
correspondence of Prodfaztop, the office routine in regard to
telegrams (whether they are in order, whether they are easy
to find, whether the time of reply is checked, and so on).

Please do this as quickly and as strictly as possible.

Lenin

Secret

Trotsky, Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council
 Kozlov, or present whereabouts

Wilson is proposing a truce and is calling all the
governments of Russia to a conference. I am afraid he wants to
secure for himself Siberia and part of the south, having
no hope otherwise of keeping anything. In the light of the
capture of Orenburg, Lugansk and Chertkov this
circumstance compels us, in my opinion, to exert every effort to
capture Rostov, Chelyabinsk and Omsk within a month.
This last is in accordance with our talk. Make a special
check of Vatsetisâs strategy after the capture of Orenburg
and give your opinion. I think you will have to go to
Wilson.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a proposed conference on the Princes Islands (Sea
of Marmora) with the participation of representatives of all the
governments existing on the territory of Russia to draw up
measures for ending the Civil War. The address to the parties to the
conference was drafted by Woodrow Wilson, President of the
United States. The imperialists started this talk about a conference
in order to halt the advance of the Red Army and, in the event
of the Soviet Government refusing to participate in the
conference, to put the blame on it for the continuation of hostilities.
The Soviet Government unmasked the imperialists who were
posing as âpeace-makersâ; on February 4, 1919, it issued a radio
statement to the governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, the
United States and Japan agreeing to participate in the conference,
which it intended to use as an international platform to expose
the interventionists. But no reply was forthcoming from the
Entente imperialists. Denikin, Kolchak and other counterâ
revolutionary governments still hoped to crush the Soviet Republic
by force of arms, and therefore refused to take part in the
conference, which was never held.

Gubernia Executive Committee
 Samara

Send immediately to Moscow all the material against
the Right Socialist-Revolutionary Alexander Mikhailovich
Smirnov, report the reasons for his arrest, verify his
statement about wishing to work with Soviet power against
Kolchak, meanwhile give Smirnov most favourable
treatment while under arrest.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs telegram followed receipt by him of a report from
Schwartz, representative of the Council of Defence in Samara,
about the arrest of A.Â M. Smirnov, a Right Socialist-Revolutionary
and former mayor of the town under the White Czechs, who gave
himself up to the Soviet authorities and declared his intention of
working with âSoviet powerâ for the purpose of fighting against
Kolchak. Schwartz reported that Smirnov put forward no
conditions for his work in the future and was backed by a group of
individuals from his camp who had decided to serve Soviet
power.

On the telegram from Samara, Lenin wrote the words: âFor
handy reference. Wired 27/1.â

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs note to Krasin, Peopleâs Commissar for Trade and
Industry, was written in connection with a report by W.Â 
Jastrzembski, a former leader of the Polish Socialist Party, who was
then in Russia, on the results of his journey to Warsaw
undertaken to explore the possibility of establishing trade and cultural
relations between the Soviet Republic and Poland. Owing to the
resistance of the Right-wing leaders of the Polish Socialist Party,
his mission was unsuccessful. Despite this Lenin was in favour
of continuing negotiations.

on the part of local Soviet and Party functionaries, the poor
organisation of agitation and propaganda in the countryside and
the weakness of the Party organisations in the gubernia.

Uyezd Executive Committee
 Yelatma

Mikhail Mitrofanovich Fedoseyev of Azeyevo complains
that you have nationalised his printing-press, refusing on
FebruaryÂ 6, reference No.Â 455, both repayment for the
printing-press and compensation for removing from work
his two girl apprentices and the woman binder. Report
immediately whether these facts are true, whether it is
true that the printing-press is standing idle at Sasovo in a
shed. Please discuss whether Fedoseyev can be put to
typographical work or allowed to set up an association of
workers and conduct controlled management of his former
printing-press in full subordination to the
Soviet.[2]

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs telegram followed a letter from M.Â M. Fedoseyev from
the village of Azeyevo, Yelatma Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia.
Fedoseyev stated that in October 1918 his printing-press in the town
of Yelatma was nationalised and now stood âin a shed, rusting
away and idleâ, at a time when the uyezd town of Yelatma was
without a printing-press and orders were being sent to towns in
other uyezds. Fedoseyev wrote that he was ânot a bourgeoisâ, that
for 27 years he had worked as a clerk, secretary, teacher, and
book-keeper; that after buying on credit an old, broken-down
printing-press, he had put it in order and had himself worked in
the print-shop as proofreader and compositor.

On Fedoseyevâs letter Lenin wrote the words: âWired 18.11â,
âfile away for handy referenceâ.





[2]
In reply to Leninâs telegram, P.Â Gorbunov, Chairman of the
Yelatma Uyezd Executive Committee, reported the same day that
the E.C. intended to merge Fedoseyevâs printing-press with
another nationalised local printing-press (of Meshcheryakov), where
both Fedoseyev and Meshcheryakov, as specialists, would be
allowed to work.

Reply to coded message received, but not a word in

step up transport. Reply.

As for the Bashkirs, you are right to demand either
disarming or immediate operations against
Kolchak.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A telegram from Headquarters of the Eastern Front on
February 19, 1919, reported on talks with representatives of the Bashkir
bourgeois-nationalist government for the cessation of this
governmentâs anti-Soviet activity and for the Bashkir troops fighting

 Â  

alongside Red Army units against Kolchak. The opinion was
expressed in the telegram that if the Bashkir troops would
immediately go over to an offensive against Kolchak they should not be
disarmed, but if they were to refuse to do so, then it was essential
to disarm them.

Joint operations by Bashkir units and the Red Army against
whiteguard troops began at the end of February 1919, and a
Bashkir Revolutionary Committee was set up. On MarchÂ 20, 1919, the
Government of the R.S.F.S.R. signed an agreement with the
Bashkir Government setting up a Bashkir Autonomous Soviet
Republic.

Comrade Ramensky
 Representative of Tver Gubernia

Tell the teachers of Tver Gubernia that the kulaks have
their grain and that the task of Soviet power is to turn
this grain over to the working people.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)

22/II. 1919
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin on the title page of a copy of his pamphlet
The Struggle for Grain (Moscow, 1918), which through the medium
of A.Â P. Ramensky (a colleague of I.Â N. UlyanovâLeninâs father)
he presented to a delegation of teachers from Tver Gubernia. The
delegation had come to Moscow to ask for help in the form of food
for Tver teachers.

Leninâs pamphlet contained the text of his report on
combating the famine delivered at a joint session of the All-Russia
Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet, and the trade
unions on June 4, 1918, and his reply to the debate on the report
(see present edition, Vol.Â 27, pp. 419â43).

This is to certify that comrades representing the Danilov
Textile Mill visited me on the question of issuing to them
a ration in textiles. Since this question has been decided
by the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee,
which, under the Constitution, stands above the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars, neither I, as Chairman of the C.P.C.,

  Â  

nor the Council of Peopleâs Commissars have the right to
alter this decision.

Vladimirov

The Council of Defence has decided that if the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic fails, within two
days, to present a reasoned decision in favour of the
Povorino-Tsaritsyn line, we shall give priority to the
Liski-Likhaya line. The Commissariat for Railways plainly states
that there cannot be enough materials for restoring the
bridges of both lines. I fully agree with this decision of
the Council of Defence, but if you can perform a miracle
by contriving to repair the Povorino-Tsaritsyn line in
addition to the Liski-Likhaya line, you will indeed be a
miracle worker.

Lenin
2

I personally agree to leave you if you undertake to
restore both lines, as you write. I shall try today to get in
touch with Tsyurupa and Sverdlov, and if we arrive at
a different decision I shall telegraph you immediately.
Probably Nevsky did not know what materials you can get
from the south. I shall pass on to him both your memos.

Lenin

Tsekhanovsky, Chairman of the Executive Committee
 Rudnya
 Copy to Gubernia Executive Committee, Mogilev

I can receive you, if not personally, then through my
secretary. In my opinion the plan of the Communists of
Mikulino Volost is not bad, but it is desirable to have at
least a brief written opinion from Orsha and Mogilev as to
the reasons for their negative attitude.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs telegram is the reply to one dated February 26, 1919,
from S.Â Y. Tsekhanovsky, Chairman of the Rudnya Executive
Committee, Mikulino Volost, Orsha Uyezd, Mogilev Gubernia.
Tsekhanovsky wrote that the Mikulino Communists had organised
a central volost workersâ co-operative for the purpose of âuniting
workers and peasants on the basis of a communist system of trade,
abolishing private trading and pillage, and reconstructing
existing kulak-dominated consumer co-operativesâ; the Rules of this
workersâ co-operative had been examined in the Supreme
Economic Council. Reporting that leaders of the uyezd and gubernia
organisations in Orsha and Mogilev were opposed to the activities
of the Mikulino Communists, Tsekhanovsky asked permission to
report to Lenin personally âon the state of affairs as the leader
of communism and defender of the proletariatâ.

I agree, but if the Military Food Bureau proves guilty
of delaying, even by one hour, the work of mobilising
workers both for responsible posts and for the
food army, then
all the members of the Military Food Bureau should be
kicked out.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs note to Maria Kostelovskaya was probably written at
the C.P.C. meeting of FebruaryÂ 27, 1919, which discussed the
draft decree on workersâ food detachments. The note was a reply
to Kostelovskayaâs proposal to postpone the discussion of this
question.

I think all of you were wasting time âtheorisingâ. Rush
Schlichter, hurry him out to the spot. Things will be clearer
on the
spot.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin on a note from A.Â I. Svidersky, member of the
Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, apparently at a
meeting of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars. Svidersky wrote
that the Food Commissariat had been discussing whether to
consider the frontier with the Ukraine open for free transport of all
food products or only of those that wore unrationed.

The organisation of food supply in the liberated districts of
the Ukraine at the beginning of 1919 was a very important

 Â  

matter. Lenin devoted great attention to this question; in particular,
he proposed to hasten Schlichterâs departure to the Ukraine,
where he was to head the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food. On
February 25, 1919, Lenin wrote on a telegram from Pyatakov,
who reported on food stocks in the Ukraine: âInform Schlichter,
adding that I am extremely dissatisfied at the delay of his
journeyâ (A.Â Schlichter, Uchitel i drug trudyashchikhsya [Teacher
and Friend of the Working People], Moscow, 1957, p.Â 55). On
February 19 and March 11,1919, the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) adopted
special decisions on food policy in the Ukraine (see Collected
Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 37, pp. 522, 630â31).

Decrees cannot be bypassed: the mere proposal invites

An exception, though, can be put through the Central

[1]
Lydia Fotieva, secretary of the C.P.C., asked Lenin to take on
for work in the C.P.C. Secretariat a woman recommended by the
Staff Bureau of the C.P.C.âs Managing Department. V.Â D.
Bonch-Bruyevich, head of the C.P.C.âs Managing Department, objected
to the appointment on the grounds that it contravened the decree
forbidding relatives to work together in the same Soviet
institutions (the candidate had a sister working in the C.P.C.). Fotieva
wrote to Lenin that the woman recommended âis a very valuable
worker and it would be in our interests to take her on.... Could
not the decree be bypassed?â

On the basis of Â§Â 3 a Note to be sent to the Polish
Government with assurances that we fully agree to, and
indeed desire, a decision by the vote of the working people;
we desire agreement on this basis, and agree to concessions

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this on a letter from the Central Executive Committee
of the Polish Socialist Party to the C.C., R.C.P.(B.). PointÂ 3 of
this letter expressed the desire that the question of frontiers with
Poland should be decided on the basis of self-determination of
the population living in the disputed territories, primarily in
Lithuania and Byelorussia. Leninâs proposal was adopted by the
C.C., R.C.P.(B.) and was reflected in Chicherinâs letter to A.Â Y.
Wi&ewhattheckowski, delegate extraordinary of the Polish Government
(see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.Â II, 1958, pp. 105â

Comrade Kamenev,

The bearers are comrades from Sarapul Uyezd, Vyatka
Gubernia.

They have brought us and Petrograd 40,000 poods of
grain each. This is such a remarkable feat that it ,fully
deserves quite special congratulations. The comrades, by
the way, ask to be put in touch with the trade unions.
Please arrange as soon as possible for them to make a report
in the Soviet. A paragraph about it should also be given
to the press. Please phone me when you get this note, and
then send the bearers to Schmidt and Tomsky.

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JanuaryÂ 29, 1919, the Second Congress of Soviets of Sarapul
Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia, adopted a decision to collect grain in
all villages of the uyezd as a gift to Moscow and Petrograd, The
Congress decided that the gift of 40,000 poods of grain for Moscow
âbe dispatched and presented personally to our dear and beloved
leader, Comrade Leninâ. Leninâs note was written following his
reception of the delegation of Sarapul peasants who had
accompanied the train-load of grain. It was written, apparently, not on
March 12 as indicated in the document, but on MarchÂ 11, 1919.
This is borne out by the following circumstances. Already on
March 12 Pravda No.Â 55 reported that Kamenev, speaking at a
plenary meeting of the Moscow Soviet on March 11, said: âI
received a letter from Comrade Lenin who had been visited by
representatives of Sarapul Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia, who had brought
40,000 poods of grain as a gift to Moscow. These delegates are
present at this meeting.â The mistake about the date is also
evident from the fact that on March 12 Lenin was in Petrograd,
where he addressed a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in the
Taurida Palace (see present edition, Vol.Â 29, pp. 19â37). Lenin
himself, speaking on March 13, 1919, at a meeting in the
Peopleâs House in Petrograd, said: âOnly a few days ago a
delegation of peasants representing five volosts in Sarapul Uyezd
came to see meâ (ibid., p.Â 47).

Comrade Petrovsky,

Please send this or a similar telegram, or give orders
for an inspection through the Gubernia Executive
Committee.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin gave this instruction to Petrovsky after receiving a
complaint from peasants of Korbangsk Volost, Kadnikovo Uyezd,
Vologda Gubernia, about the incorrect attitude of the Volost
Executive Committee towards the middle peasants. Lenin wrote the
instruction on the following draft of a telegram in Krupskayaâs
handwriting: âTo the Korbangsk Volost Soviet, Kadnikovo Uyezd,
Vologda Gubernia. Draw up immediately in all villages lists of
electors to the Soviet, excluding only known kulaks and drawing
the middle peasants into the elections. After compiling the lists,
fix new elections to the Soviet. A check will be carried out. Those
guilty of incorrectly compiling the lists will have to answer for
itâ (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 50, p.Â 476).

Shortly after this, on learning of the rude behaviour of A.Â G.
Pravdin, a member of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Internal Affairs, towards U.Â P. Mostakova, who had delivered
the complaint of the Vologda peasants, Lenin wrote to Petrovsky:
â...Pravdin must be hauled over the coals. Donât let him have his
own way, and put him under supervision, he has a tendency
towards stupid âorder issuingâ. This must be put an end toâ (ibid).

Kayurov
 5thÂ Army

Your unaccountably optimistic telegram received; I very
much fear that such optimism, which has already done
much harm in the east, will do more harm now. Report
whether you gave your opinion to Trotsky and what
measures you have taken to improve political work, put heart
into the reinforcements and inspire them with political
consciousness.

Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was a reply to a telegram from V.Â N. Kayurov, head of the
Political Department of the 5th Army, who reported the capture
of Ufa by whiteguard troops and the grave plight of the 5thÂ 

 Â  

Army. At the same time, Kayurov expressed confidence that if â
class-conscious, trained reinforcementsâ were sent, âthe enemy will be
routedâ.

Bela Kun
 Budapest

I am sending you a copy of our radio-telegram of today
to Pichon on the question of the exchange with
France.[1]

Our Red Cross Commission headed by Manuilsky left for
France to organise repatriation of our men, but has been
held up. We promised to repatriate the French servicemen
still with us if repatriation of our men from France is
organised and proceeds at full speed. The French Government
prevented Manuilskyâs Commission from organising this
work. Of the 35,000 Russian soldiers in France, Africa and
Salonica, France wants to repatriate 900 men now and
makes empty promises of repatriating our soldiers later on
as opportunity offers, but in exchange for this, France
demands that we should immediately let all the Frenchmen
go home.

France wants to send Manuilskyâs mission back together
with the 900 Russian soldiers, although nothing has been
done to organise further repatriation. France wants to get
everything and give almost nothing and get rid of
Manuilsky.

Yet we are aware that our soldiers who remain in France
and refuse to join the army are subjected to the most
monstrous persecution and that Manuilsky has been forbidden
to establish any sort of contact with them.

We refuse, on such conditions, to let the Frenchmen go
home. This is the substance of my radio-telegram, a copy
of which is being sent to you. The French will shout blue
murder, and tell the Americans every sort of disgusting lie.
Please hand a copy of our Note to the American
representative for his government.

Lenin

To impose the extraordinary tax on peasants with below
average income is illegal. Measures have been taken to
lighten the taxation of middle peasants. In a few days there
will be a
decree.[2] Regarding the remaining questions,
I shall make immediate inquiries of the Peopleâs Commissars
and a reply will be sent to you.

Leninâs reply to the peasants of Skopin Uyezd. Ryazan Gubernia,
was written in connection with the mandate of the uyezd
consultative congress, in which the peasants raised the questions of
reducing the extraordinary revolutionary tax on peasants of average
and below-average moans, abolishing the mobilisation of draught
horses and milch cows, increasing the grain quota to be left for
the peasant farms, and others.





[2]
The decree âOn Privileges for Middle Peasants in Levying the
Extraordinary Revolutionary Taxâ was adopted at a session of
the All-Russia C.E.C. on AprilÂ 9, 1919. It was published in
Izvestia on AprilÂ 10.

Sereda and Tsyurupa

Peasant Filipp Ilyich Bodrov (living in Forest School,
Sokolniki, Moscow)âformerly a Petrograd worker, over 20
years in the Partyâwho has a farm in Venev Uyezd, Tula
Gubernia (about 20 members of the family living together,
undivided, a âmiddle peasantâ), assures me that grain can
be carted to Moscow over a distance of up to 200Â versts
(his village is 180Â versts from Moscow). We have grain,
he says, we also have surpluses.

We have missed the winter period, he says, but after
the sowing (which ends at about St.Â Nicholasâs
Day[1]

)

there
will be about a monthâs free time (before dung carting,
about a week before St.Â Peterâs
Day[2]

).

This, he says,
should be utilised.

Information should be collected urgently, at once, and
if there is even a slight chance, this measure should be
carried out, for there will be no consignments from the cast.

Lenin asks you to greet the Bavarian Soviet Republic.
He requests to be informed urgently and in as great detail
as possible. In particular about everything concerned with
land socialisation in Bavaria.

AprilÂ 8, 2.15Â a.m.

Please give us details about the revolution that has taken
place in Bavaria. Apart from the brief radio-telegram
of the Bavarian Soviet Government we have no information.
Please let us know how events are developing there and
whether the new order holds full sway. Please give us the
information I asked for yesterday about your programme on
the national question. What is the position in Bavaria as
regards the agrarian programme of the Soviet
Government?[1]


Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
This refers to the Bavarian Soviet Government.âEd.
 



[2]
Leninâs radio-telegrams to Bela Kun were sent in connection with
the news of the proclamation of a Soviet Republic in Munich on
AprilÂ 7, 1919. At that time it was not yet known in Moscow that
the Soviet Republic in Munich had been proclaimed by leaders

 Â  

of the German Social-Democrats and of the Centrist Independent
Social-Democratic Party of Germany, who by this manoeuvre
wanted to deceive the workers and to discredit the idea of Soviet
power. Conditions in Bavaria not yet being ripe for the
proclamation of a Soviet Republic, the Bavarian Communists refused to
take part in this provocative act of adventurism.

On AprilÂ 13, 1919, when the Bavarian counter-revolutionaries
made an attempt to seize power, a furious struggle took place on
the streets of Munich, ending in the victory of the workers. A
Soviet government was set up in Bavariaâthe Executive Committee
headed by the leader of the Bavarian Communists, Eugene
Levin; the government also included Independents. The
Government of the Bavarian Soviet Republic set about disarming the
bourgeoisie, organising a Red Army, nationalising the banks,
establishing workersâ control at enterprises, and organising food
supply.

On AprilÂ 27, 1919, Lenin wrote his âMessage of Greetings
to the Bavarian Soviet Republicâ, in which he gave the
revolutionary government of Bavaria advice in the form of a concrete
programme of action for the proletarian party that had come to
power (see present edition, Vol.Â 29, pp. 325â26).

The home and foreign situation of the Bavarian Soviet
Republic was a difficult one. At the very first difficulties encountered
by the Soviet Republic the representatives of the âIndependent
Social-Democratsâ began to pursue a treacherous policy. Towards
the end of April, the Independents succeeded in removing the
Communists from leading positions. Taking advantage of this
situation, the counter-revolutionaries went over to the offensive.
On MayÂ 1, whiteguard units entered Munich and after three daysâ
hard fighting captured the city.

Compulsory measures of any kind to make the peasants

impermissible. Non-observance of this will be punished with
all the severity of revolutionary

Notes

[2]
This telegram was sent in connection with a report from
Knyaginin Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, addressed to Lenin at
the Council of Peopleâs Commissars, stating that the local
authorities were forcibly making the peasants join artels and communes.

The telegram was drafted in the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Agriculture.

On AprilÂ 10, 1919, the following circular letter, signed by
Lenin and Sereda, was published in Izvestia:

âTo all Gubernia Land Departments.

âCopies to Executive Committees.

âInformation has reached the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Agriculture that for the purpose of organising state farms, communes
and other collective associations, the land departments and state
farm boards, contrary to the intent of ArticleÂ 9 of the Regulations
on Socialist Organisation of Agriculture, are taking away from
the peasants the lands of former landownersâ estates which had
been made over to them. The impermissibility of such practices
is hereby confirmed. Lands being worked by peasants at the time
of the publication of the Regulations on Socialist Organisation
of Agriculture, and which were put at their disposal on the basis

 Â  

of decisions or instructions of uyezd or gubernia land departments,
may not on any account be forcibly alienated for the purpose of
organising state farms, communes or other collective associations.
The alienation of lands from the peasants for the sake of the
above-mentioned organisations is permissible only by voluntary consent
by way of land tenure regulation. Measures of coercion to make
the peasants practise joint cultivation and join communes and
other types of collective farming are impermissible. The
transition to collective forms is to be carried out only in strict
conformity with the Regulations, without any compulsion on the part of
the authorities. Non-fulfilment of the present instruction will be
punished in accordance with the laws of the revolutionary period.
Inform the population of the present instruction as widely as
possible.

In a telegram by direct line, Minin, a member of the Board of the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Internal Affairs, informed Lenin of
the termination of the strike at the Tula arms factories and railway
workshops. The telegram mentioned the need for timely and
regular supply of food for the workers of the Tula factories through the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, and the speedy delivery by the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Finance of money for paying wages.

workers, exhausted Red Army men and weakened workers
from the north, urgent measures must be taken to protect
the southern health resorts won back by the Red Army.
 

Please give immediate orders to chiefs of army units
operating in the south of Russia and on the Taurida
Peninsula to take the strictest steps to prevent destruction
or looting of medical appliances, buildings, inventory,
plantations, materials and supplies at the health resorts of
southern Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, Odessa, Golaya

In code
 Rakovsky
 Kiev

In regard to the S.R.s, I advise giving no more than
three and keeping these three pretty thoroughly under
surveillance of the Bolsheviks, and if they do not agreeâ
so much the worse for them, we only stand to
gain.[1]
Regarding military tasks, I remind you again of two of
the most important: a break-through at Bukovina and the
capture of Rostov. All efforts must be devoted to these two
tasksâconfirm this to Podvoisky and Antonov. As to
Dybenkoâs plans, I warn you against any adventureâI fear
it will end in failure and he will be cut
off.[2] Would it
not be wiser to have his forces replace Makhno and strike
at Taganrog and Rostov? I advise thinking it over thrice;
decide yourself, of course.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the inclusion of Socialist-Revolutionaries in the
Ukrainian Government.





[2]
This refers to an offensive by the troops of the Crimean Front, under
the command of P.Â Y. Dybenko, into the interior of the Crimean
Peninsula. The offensive was a mistake, since the attacking units
could have been cut off in the Perekop Isthmus from the main
forces and, moreover, at that time it was essential to concentrate
maximum forces for an attack in the chief strategic directionâ
that of the Donets Basin and Rostov.

representatives of the peasants of Pochep Uyezd, Chernigov
Gubernia, who had come to Moscow with a complaint about the
abuses practised by the local authorities and had been received
by Lenin. They wrote that on their return homo they had been

20.Â IV. 1919

Gubernia Executive Committee
 Tambov

I enclose a telegram from
Tambov.[1] Please arrange
another general meeting of these 252 (it is not clear whether
they are all the members of the co-operative or only some
of them, and if so, out of what total number) and explain
the following to them:

âThe Council of Peopleâs Commissars has passed a decree
for the organisation of consumersâ communes in the
interests of correct distribution of products. It is unjust that
the distribution of products essential for the whole
population should be handled only by part of the population,
as was the case under capitalism. In all countries the
cooperatives under capitalism embrace mainly the upper
sections of workers and peasants. It is essential that now not
only the upper sections, but all working people, every one
of them, should take part in the distribution of products.

âThere is hardly a single one of the great founders of
the world co-operative movement who has not pointed to
the conversion of this movement into socialism. Now
indeed this time has come, and all the best elements in the
co-operatives are in sympathy with the development of the
co-operative movement as envisaged in the decree on the
conversion of the co-operatives into consumersâ communes
embracing all the working people without exception.

âThe members of the consumersâ communes retain the right
of fully independent control, as also the right to conduct
affairs independently. This is why I am asking the
meeting to revise its decision, to recognise the binding
nature of the decree of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
and not to make the workersâ and peasantsâ government have
recourse to undesirable measures of compulsion.

âV.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 âChairman, C.P.C.â
 

Read out at the meeting the part in quotation marks,
and publish it in the local newspaper. Amplify (tactfully,
without using hard words) what I have said. Wire
fulfilment.

This refers to a telegram from the Tambov Consumersâ Society
to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars concerning
implementation of the decree of the C.P.C., dated March 16, 1919, on
consumersâ communes. The decree provided for the amalgamation
of all consumersâ co-operatives in town and country into
consumersâ communes with the aim of creating a single distributive
apparatus. The telegram from Tambov reported that 252 members
of the Tambov Consumersâ Society found at their meeting that
trade was being conducted properly and âdo not want to hand
over the Consumersâ Society to consumersâ communesâ.

Commander-in-Chief Vatsetis and
 Aralov, member of the R.M.C.R.
 Serpukhov

The advance into part of Galicia and Bukovina is
essential for contact with Soviet Hungary. This task must be
achieved more quickly and surely, but beyond this task
no occupation of Galicia and Bukovina is needed, for the
Ukrainian army must on no account be distracted from its
two main objectives: the first, the most important and
most urgent, is to help the Donets Basin. This assistance
must be given quickly and on a large scale. The second
objective is to establish a secure link by rail with Soviet
Hungary. Inform us of your directives to Antonov and
measures for checking their fulfilment.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Defence

This is a reply to a telegram received on April 21, 1919, from
Commander-in-Chief I.Â I. Vatsetis and member of the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Republic S.Â I. Aralov, inquiring whether
an advance into Galicia and Bukovina was permissible politically
and what objective it pursued.

Lenin wrote on the telegram from Vatsetis and Aralov: âTo
Comrade Sklyanskyâs secretary: please code and send off the
attached (this probably refers to Leninâs telegram.âEd.), then pass
it on to Comrade Sklyansky for filing.â (Iz istorii grazhdanskoi
voiny v SSSR, Vol.Â 2, 1961, p.Â 382.)

Comrade Sklyansky,

This, by the way, is pertinent to what was decided
yesterday.

It is necessary urgently, at once:

1) to draw up the text of a directive from the C.C. to
all ânationalsâ on army unity
(integration)[1]

;



2) to give it also to the press for a series of articles;

3) re universal military training (100% to be taken and
not
75%[3]), prepare immediately, today, a draft decree;

4) calculate: 24,000 command personnel. At the ratio of
1 to 10 that means an army of 240,000.

Verify and take as the norm at once for the Central Board
of Supply of both Russia and the Ukraine.
 

Notes
 

[1]

 âDraft C.C. Directives on Army Unityâ. See present edition,
Vol.Â 29, pp.Â 404â05.âEd.
 



[2]
Leninâs directives to Sklyansky were written on a report from
Commander-in-Chief Vatsetis dated AprilÂ 23, 1919, concerning
the military situation of the R.S.F.S.R. Vatsetis argued the
necessity to unite the armed forces of the Soviet Republics and place
them under a single command; he also proposed that the system
of Universal Military Training should be temporarily done away

 Â  

with and its 24,000 instructors mobilised to strengthen the
command of the reserve units on the Eastern Front.





[3]
The report of Vatsetis has a postscript by Aralov, who objected
to the total liquidation of the U.M.T. and proposed simply
reducing it by 50 to 75 per cent.

Sokolnikov

It is necessary at all costs to put down the revolt
quickly, once and for all. Beloborodov has been sent from the
Central Committee. I fear you are making a mistake in
not applying severe measures, but if you are absolutely
convinced that there are not enough forces for dealing with
it summarily, then wire immediately and in detail. What
about promising an amnesty and at that price completely
disarming them? Reply at once. We are sending trainees
of two more commandersâ courses.

Mekhonoshin
 Astrakhan

From the report of 23/4 it is evident that the Ardahan
and Kars passed from Baku to Guriev with impunity. So
the Astrakhan people boastfully promise great victories in
the future, but at the same time they let the enemy through

  Â  

to Guriev. This is outrageous and even makes one suspect
either treachery or malicious sabotage. We demand from
you strictest control, personal checking, careful supervision
and utmost vigilance.

Comrade Zinoviev,

Read this yourself and show it to Comrade Badayev.
He must be strictly reproved: one more instance of
non-fulfilment of directives from the centreâand we shall
prosecute him. This is no joke.

Get him to sign that he has read this.

26/IV.

P.S. Return the enclosed material and this letter.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs instruction to Zinoviev was written on a letter from V.Â N.
Yakovleva, a member of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Food, replying to an inquiry of Leninâs concerning a request
by the Petrograd Co-operative of Ukrainian Citizens for their
rationed food products to be turned over to them. The letter stated
that, at the request of the Ukrainian Soviet Government, the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, byway of exception, had
permitted this co-operative to import from the Ukraine a small amount
of rationed food products, but that A.Â Y. Badayev, Food
Commissar of the Petrograd Labour Commune, had prevented it.
Yakovleva wrote that this was not the first case of failure on the part of
Badayev to comply with the instructions of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Food.

On the basis of a decision of the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars dated 25/III. 1919 this Protection Certificate
is issued to Citizen Vladimir Ivanovich Taneyev, 78Â years

  Â  

of age, who for many years carried on scientific work and,

friend of the peopleâs
emancipationâ.[2]

Citizen Vladimir Ivanovich Taneyev is given the right
to visit the library of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars,
and all other state libraries are directed to give him every
assistance in his scientific work and researches. All Soviet
authorities are instructed to afford Citizen Vladimir
Ivanovich Taneyev assistance in the matter of his own security
and that of his family, home and property. In the event
of his travelling through the Russian Socialist Soviet
Republic all railway and steamship authorities are instructed
to afford Citizen Vladimir Ivanovich Taneyev and his
family every possible assistance in obtaining train tickets
and berths.

On May 25, 1919, after examining the question of material
assistance for V.Â I. Taneyev, a Russian revolutionary democrat, public

I have had a detailed report from Vatsetis and the Chief
of Staff. The conclusion is a sad one. Strenuous efforts are
needed. The present enthusiasm must not be allowed to
subside, but must be sustained for at least 2 months and
still further intensified. Otherwise we shall not finish the
war, and finished it must be at all costs, as signs of
weariness among the masses (100,000 deserters) are becoming
more frequent.

I have discussed the following measures with Trotsky:

1) Some 3,000 Petrograd workers, unfit for war and
unarmed, to be sent to the Don. Purposeâto set things
going, to weaken the Cossacks, demoralise them from within,
settle among them, set up groups in the villages, etc.

2) All means and resources to be used more and more to
get ready a flotilla for the Volga. Especially repairs.

3) Ditto as regards artillery (without taking away from
the Karelian line). It is necessary again and again to check
with the army men whether it is possible to help the east
with artillery.

4) Rifles to be collected, especially broken ones (in Tula
800 a day can be repaired; work is lacking).

5) Mobilisation of Petrograd workers to be continued
both for the Ukraine and for the Don.
 

I received a telegram today from Zinoviev on the
stoppage of several works, big ones, in Petrograd, owing to
oil shortage. I could not get Krasin on the phone. When
I do I shall tell him. But I donât think any oil is or will
be available. I advise moving every one of these workers
to the Ukraine, to the Don, to the east, for 3 months.
It is stupid to starve, to perish in Petrograd, when it is
possible to win grain and coal.

6) Mobilisation of Party functionaries to be continued,
too, especially for places close to the front line.

It is necessary again and again âto rob Petrogradâ,
that is, to take people from it, otherwise neither Petrograd
nor Russia can be saved.

Various branches of administration and of cultural and
educational work in Petrograd can and should be weakened
tenfold for 3Â months.

We shall then save both Russia and Petrograd.

We have no other workers to equal the Petrograders.

Greetings,
 Lenin

It will not be too late to make rotten concessions in
June. Tsyurupa asserts that the Central Food Purchasing
Commission procured several millions (non-rationed), but
âfree procurementâ killed it and yielded much less.

Let us check these figuresâen masse.

1) How much (in actual fact) did the Central Food
Purchasing Commission procure (and transport) in 2 or 3
months?

2) How much did the âfreeâ carriers transport in 
February+March?

difficult.

Written at a time when Communists were being mobilised for
the struggle against Kolchak, this note is a reply to
Kostelovskaya, a Party member. She asked how she was to understand her
appointment to the Eastern Front as the head of the Political
Department of the 2nd Army.

This instruction to Rudzutak, Chairman of the Chief Board of

several vessels with grain, crude oil and paraffin from
Chistopol (Eastern Front), which had been occupied by whiteguard
troops, owing to the boats coming under fire from, whiteguard
cavalry.

Sklyansky: this is very important;
it is necessary to leave
them part of the 33rdÂ Division and immediately get Vatsetis
to send an absolutely precise telegram to this effect to
Astrakhan.

Lenin

2/V.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written on a telegram from K.Â A. Mekhonoshin,
Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 11thÂ Army,
who asked that part of the 33rd Division, which was to be

 Â  

transferred to the Eastern Front, should be left in the Astrakhan area.
Mekhonoshin reported that the transfer of the whole 33rd
Division and the impossibility of a rapid formation of the 34th
Division, owing to the delay in sending promised reinforcements, would
compel them to stop the offensive against Kizlyar and give up
the idea of capturing Guriev and Rakusha, where there was oil,
and would put the fleet, which was threatened with loss of its
base, in a hopeless position. âThe absence of precise orders from
Field Headquarters,â wrote Mekhonoshin, âputs the army in an
absolutely impossible position and gives grounds for accusing us
of inactivity.â Lenin made a number of underlinings and markings
on Mekhonoshinâs telegram (Lenin Miscellany XXXIV, pp. 127â
28).

Comrade Badayev,

Donât be capricious, you are not a school miss. You
were asked not whether you consider âall your actionsâ
âabsolutely (!!) correctâ (that is ludicrous!!), but whether
you have carried out all orders from the centre. But you
are silent about this! Go on workingâwe do not accept your
resignation. In future carry out all orders from the centre
and do not talk unseemly nonsense about âintriguesâ.

Greetings,
 Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this note on a statement by A.Â Y. Badayev to the
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet
of Workersâ and Red Army Deputies. Badayev tried to justify
the various instances of non-fulfilment by him of the orders of
the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food (see NoteÂ 211), claiming that
the accusations against him were âintrigues of a definite group
in the Centreâ and asking to be relieved within five days of his
post as Food Commissar of the Petrograd Labour Commune.

Dear Comrades,

I am sending you my comments. In the absence of
essential differences of opinion, decide for yourselves. My
advice is: use it for propaganda, for clearly it can serve no
other useful purpose. Be extremely polite to Nansen, 
extremely insolent to Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau.
This is very useful, the only way to speak to them, the
right tone.

Lenin

6/V.

I think both replies are quite correct, in proposing a
meeting and thanking Nansen. But it seems to me that the
propaganda side should be more fully developed, taking
advantage of the fact that the Entente, while easily
concealing from everyone all other documents of
ours,[1]

will be
unable, by way of exception, to conceal precisely this reply.

I would therefore advise using for propaganda and
elaborating in greater detail the separation of
(Î±) the 
humanitarian and
(Î²) the political aspect.

(Î±) You mention the humanitarian (it seems, only the
humanitarian?) nature of the proposal? For this all thanks
and compliments to Nansen personally. If itâs
humanitarian aims,
then do not bring politics into it, dear sir, but
just start shipping (stress this). Just start shipping! We
are even ready to pay through the nose for it and
willingly admit you for control and give you every guarantee.
Dilate on this, rub it in, make it clear. Appoint a place
and time for the talks!

But if a truce, then this is politics] You are an educated
man, Mr.Â Nansen, you know perfectly well that every war
and every truce is politics.
This means you have linked the
âhumanitarianâ with the âpoliticalâ. You have lumped
them together! Explain to him, as you would to a 16â
year-old lass, why a truce is politics.
 

(Î²) Is it a good thingâto mix the âhumanitarianâ with
âpoliticsâ? No, it is a bad thing, because it is hypocrisy,
for which you are not to blame, and it is not you we are
blaming. For one must talk frankly about politics without
taking cover behind âhumanitarianismâ.

And once you have started talking politics, then, by
your leave, we are obliged to answer you to the point.

(Î²1)
If the truce is for peace, then you are perfectly aware
that we are for it. We agreed (even!) to the Princes Islands.

 [


We confirmed this to Bullitt who, unfortunately, proved,
like the whole of American policy, to be a captive of
Clemenceau and Lloyd George, for what Bullitt promised us,
assuring us that America would make Clemenceau and
Lloyd George come to heel, remained unfulfilled (it would
be useful to âtauntâ Wilson about
it!).[4]][2]


It was not we who torpedoed the Princes Islands, but the
monarchists and anti-Jew pogromists, the restorers of the
landownersâ estates. Explain, develop, prove these three
points, that Denikin and Kolchak
1) are monarchists;
2)
pogromist thugs;
3) are restoring the estates of the landowners
and introducing redemption payments for the peasants.

We agreed to a truce for negotiations about peace, of
course, with those who are really to blame for the war,
i.e., with Great Britain, France, America, and not with
pawns. Explain in detail that it is they who are waging
war, with their ships, their guns, their cartridges, their
officers. Reveal in detail
the outrageously false ârenunciation
of interventionâ in the face of their support (and egging
on) of the Estonians, Finns, Poles.

(Î²2)
Further, if the truce is not for peace, but for a
political gameâwe donât want it. Peace is not a joking matter.
No one will succeed in fooling us. Develop this point, too.

Wind up with a rÃ©sumÃ©: if it is politics, then we
proposed a truce for peace, we agreed, we did not torpedo the
Princes Islands, we are always ready for talks with those
who are really to blame for the war.
 

If it is not politics, but humanitarianism, we say
thank-you, we accept, we invite you to come, to control, and
will go anywhere you like (time, place) and will pay even
three times the price in timber, ore, ships.

Indeed, we must not miss the opportunity of replying
to Nansen in a way that would make good
propaganda.[5]
 

Notes
 

[1]
The reference is to the numerous official peace proposals
addressed to the Entente powers (see present edition, Vol.Â 30,
pp.Â 191â92).âEd.

[2]
If all are against, throw it out (probably this refers to the text
which Lenin put in square brackets.âEd.). But in my opinion, it is
extremely useful in practice to set Wilson at variance with them by
declaring that Wilson is a pawn in the hands of Clemenceau and Lloyd
George, in submitting to these two, to this âmajorityâ!!âLenin
 



[3]
On MayÂ 4, 1919, a letter addressed to Lenin was received by radio
from Fridtjof Nansen, Norwegian scientist and arctic explorer.
The letter was dated AprilÂ 17, 1919. In it Nansen gave the text
of his appeal to the heads of government of the four Entente
Powers (U.S.A., France, Great Britain and Italy) proposing the
setting up of a committee to organise aid for Russia with food
and medical supplies, and their reply. In their reply the heads
of the Entente Powers (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George,
Georges Clemenceau and Vittorio Orlando) made this aid
conditional on the cessation of military operations on the territory
of Russia, but without indicating whether this condition would
be binding on the powers who were pursuing a policy of armed
intervention against the Soviet Republic. Nansen had obviously
failed to see through the manoeuvres of the Entente leaders and
expressed his agreement with the conditions they had put
forward. On the same day, MayÂ 4, Lenin informed Chicherin that
this question had been referred to the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) and asked him to draft a reply
to Nansen, emphasising the need to expose the imperialists.

Leninâs letter published here contains his remarks on the draft
reply to Nansen.





[4]
William Bullitt, the American diplomat, came to Soviet Russia in
March 1919 to ascertain the conditions on which the Soviet
Government would agree to conclude peace with the Entente countries
as well as with the whiteguard governments on Russian territory.
Proposals emanating from the U.S. President, Woodrow Wilson,
and the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, were transmitted
through Bullitt. The Soviet Government, striving for the speediest

 Â  

conclusion of peace, agreed to negotiations on the proposed terms,
introducing into them, however, some essential amendments (for
the text of the peace proposal drafted by the U.S. government
representative, Bullitt, and the Government of the R.S.F.S.R.,
see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.Â II, 1958, pp. 91â95).
Shortly after Bullittâs departure from Soviet Russia, Kolchak
succeeded in achieving some successes on the Eastern Front, and
the imperialist governments, anticipating the collapse of the Soviet
state, refused peace negotiations. Wilson forbade publication of
the draft agreement brought by Bullitt, and Lloyd George, in
a speech in Parliament, declared that he had nothing to do with
the negotiations with the Soviet Government.





[5]
Leninâs remarks on the draft replies to Nansen were fully taken
into account in the radio-telegram of May 7, 1919 (see Dokumenty
vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.Â II, 1958, pp. 154â60). The plan put
forward by Nansen came to nothing.

 Copy to Artyom

I have received from Lutovinov yet another confirmation
that you are playing at being independent and at local
republics, by refusing to send immediately to the Donets
Basin all military forces and all the mobilised workers of
Kharkov, and by giving as an excuse idiotic prohibitions
from Podvoisky. I declare that you will be brought before
a Party court and expelled from the Party if you do not
give up this game and do not at once send all military
forces of Kharkov and all mobilised workers to the relief
of the Donets Basin. Reply in code without delay regarding
fulfilment, how many you are sending, and when. You
will be held responsible for delay.

Are you aware of the grave position of
Orenburg?[2]
Today, through railwaymen who had spoken by direct line,
I was told of the desperate request of the Orenburgers to
be sent 2 regiments of infantry and 2 of cavalry, or at least
1,000 infantrymen and a few squadrons to begin with.
Let me know at once what has been done and what your
plans are. You will not, of course, regard my telegram
as violating army orders.

Sokolnikov
 Boguchar

We have received from Beloborodov the following
telegrams, the first: âThe front at Donets has been broken
throughâ, etc., and the second: âIt is necessary to expel
from the Red Army ranksâ, etc. In addition there is a
report on demoralisation in our units and complete lack
of energy on the part of the local command. Evidently
the liquidation of the revolt is being more and more delayed,
yet the threat of the insurgents joining forces with Denikinâs
troops is growing. Are you keeping a sufficiently attentive
eye on the operations? Should not units be added from the
reserves of the Southern Front? How many of the 214Â 
Communists Smilga sent to the south in April and May have
been used for this purpose? What new effective measures
have been taken to put an end to the revolt and when can
one expect it to be put down? Are the peasants south of

  Â  

the revolt being
mobilised?[1]

The case of the General Staff
memberÂ ...[2]

must be investigated. We await a reply.

15.Â V. 1919

Trotsky

I am very glad about the energetic measures for
suppressing the revolt and particularly about the assignment
of the 33rdÂ Division for this purpose. In my opinion, the
utmost should be done to make use of the feeling against
Grigoriev for maximum and speediest pressure on the
Donets Basin. Unless we capture Rostov soon we shall not
be able to bear the remaining burdens.

Lenin

15.Â V. 1919

Gubernia Executive Committee
 Kostroma
 for Lunacharsky

I have asked the Commissariat for Food to report about
relief
measures.[1] I fear that the revolt in the Ukraine

  Â  

will hinder the administration of relief, as the situation is
deteriorating.[2] Push ahead vigorously with mass
migration to the
Don.[3] Get in touch with Sereda.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lunacharsky, who had been sent to Kostroma as an authorised
agent of the All-Russia C.E.C. to combat desertions, reported on
the serious food situation in Kostroma and Kostroma
Gubernia.





[2]
This refers to the counter-revolutionary revolt of Ataman
Grigoriev, which broke out at the beginning of May 1919 in the rear
of the Soviet troops in the Ekaterinoslav and Kherson gubernias.
The revolt directly threatened the flank and rear of the Soviet
troops in the Donets Basin and the rear communications of units
of the 2nd Ukrainian Army in the Crimea, and also hindered
railway transport throughout the Ukraine. In the period from May
11 to 24, by simultaneous blows from the east, north and south,
the troops of the Ukrainian armies routed the insurgents.





[3]
On AprilÂ 24, 1919, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars adopted
the decree âOn Organising Migration to the Producing Gubernias
and the Don Regionâ. The migration of peasants and workers
of the northern gubernias of the R.S.F.S.R. to the southern areas
of the country was carried out in order to ease their plight in the
matter of food supply and restore agriculture in localities which
had suffered from whiteguard revolts.

On this subject see also the telegram of May 21, 1919, signed
by Lenin and S.Â P. Sereda, sent to the gubernia land departments
in Smolensk, Tver, Moscow and Ryazan (Lenin Miscellany XXXIV,
pp. 144â45).

20.Â V. 1919

Comrade Sokolnikov

I take this opportunity to discuss the revolt at greater
length. Your telegram of the 17th (No.Â 189) distresses me
very much: You speak only of âdemoralisationâ of â
expeditionary troopsâ and not a word about the division (the
34th, I believe), which was landed to suppress the revolt!
Not a word!
 

After the offensive against Petrograd, suppression of the
revolt, the most ruthless and immediate suppression coÃ»te
que coÃ»te, is an absolute necessity. Please do not be diverted
from this and send information in code twice weeklyâI
shall insist on the dispatch to you of what is required,
just as I insisted today on an additional telegram about
(what has already been ordered three times) the dispatch to
you of Communists from Voronezh and Tambov gubernias.

Have done with the revolt quickly at all costs!

Yours,
 Lenin

We shall push on also with all our might with migration
to the Don from non-agricultural places to get the farmsteads
occupied, the rear fortified correspondingly, and so on.

We shall send trainees as well: I made arrangements
with Sklyansky yesterday.

20/V.

Trotsky

In connection with the coded telegram from the three
commanders of the Eastern Front, I propose that Kamenev
be appointed commander of the front, that Kostyaev be
replaced, and Lashevich appointed instead of
Aralov.[1]
Reply about the plenum. Iâm afraid Stalin and Zinoviev
will not be able to attend on the 25th, and to tear you
away too is harmful. Therefore I propose that the plenum
be postponed and that we come to an agreement by
telegram.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telegram to the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.), S.Â I.
Gusev, M.Â M. Lashevich and K.Â K. Yurenev, members of the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Eastern Front, objected to

 Â  

S.Â S. Kamenev being replaced by A.Â A. Samoilo as commander
of the Eastern Front. The telegram stated that F.Â V. Kostyaev,
Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Military Council of the
Republic, was making unwarranted replacements of army commanders,
and that S.Â I. Aralov, a member of the R.Â M.Â C. of the Republic,
endorsed these orders of Kostyaevâs by his signature. On MayÂ 25,
1919, S.Â S. Kamenev was reappointed commander of the Eastern
Front.

Lenin, the Chairman of the Artel Association, A.Â A. Bulatov, and

arrested.

Lenin wrote the following note on the telegram he had
received: âFile for handy reference. Reply sent 20/V.â

Trotsky

I have just learned of the break-through of our front at
Riga. Riga is evidently
lost.[2] Most likely treachery of
the Lettish bourgeois officers. Possibly also preparations
for a general, determined offensive along the whole Western
Front. All this obliges us to increase tenfold the attack
on the Donets Basin and at all costs to put down the revolt
on the Don immediately. Sklyansky and I will send another
thousand trainees there over and above the thousand sent
yesterday.[1]

I advise you to devote yourself wholly to
liquidating the revolt.

Executive Committee
 Odessa
 Copy to Rakovsky, Council of Peopleâs Commissars, Kiev

Allowing foreigners to leave on their own is criminal.
To let Russians out under the guise of foreigners is a
counter-revolutionary act, tantamount to treason. Foreigners
in general should not be allowed out without compensation
which can only be ordered by the central government.
Citizens of the Entente countries should not be allowed to
go, other than by way of exchange carried out by the
central government. Not a single Frenchman should be allowed
to go out until the return of the soldiers from France, among
whom there are many Ukrainians. Those guilty of violating
this should be held strictly responsible. Bear in mind that
the Finnish Government, obviously at the instigation of
the Entente, is hindering the release to Russia of Russian
soldiers; therefore do not allow a single bourgeois, a single
person, to leave Odessa and the Ukraine. Exceptionsâ
Chinese workers, Persians, by orders from the
centre.[1]

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The sentence in the telegram from the words âBear in mindâ to
the words âand the Ukraineâ was written by Lenin. The first
part of the telegram is a typewritten text, apparently written
by Chicherin since there is a note by him to the document
saying: âTo Comrade Lenin. Draft of a telegram; please reply
whether you agree to it.â He also wrote the last sentence: â
ExceptionsâChinese workers, Persians, by orders from the centre.â

Rakovsky

Congratulations on the capture of Alexandria and
Znamenka.[1] I emphatically request that the released forces
be sent to the Donets Basin.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Alexandria and Znamenka were centres of the counterâ
revolutionary revolt of Ataman Grigoriev. On the night of MayÂ 21, 1919,
Soviet troops fought their way into Alexandria, where Grigoriev
had his headquarters.

Directive of the C.C.

Concentrate all forces on the Donets Basin, take all you
can from the Western Front, reducing to a minimum all
active operations on your Western Front. Send Pyatakov
and Bubnov to Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav, for the most
complete, energetic mobilisation of workers for the
Southern Front on their personal
responsibility.[3]

 29.Â V. 1919

Rakovsky for Joffe
 Council of Peopleâs Commissars of the Ukraine
 Kiev

Read this telegram to Rakovsky, Mezhlauk, Voroshilov,
Pyatakov, Bubnov, Kviring and other prominent
functionaries.

I consider it criminal on your part to have persuaded
Trotsky to leave Podvoisky.

Not a single promise is being fulfilled: the Donets Basin
has no reinforcements; the mobilisation of workers is
proceeding at a disgracefully sluggish pace. You are
personally responsible for the inevitable catastrophe. All
prominent functionaries must be taken off their jobs and
installed in Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav for the total
mobilisation of workers; further, one prominent functionary to
be sent to each army unit for its advance to the Donets
Basin; and everything set in motion for clearing out
uniforms from the stores. The ruin of the entire revolution
is absolutely inevitable unless there is a swift victory in
the Donets Basin, for which it is essential to abandon
routine in the Ukraine, to work in a revolutionary spirit,
to rally all and sundry, to keep an eye personally on each
army unit, each step in the work, to set aside everything
except the Donets Basin, to have three soldiers to one
rifle. From you not one factual report.

Lenin

Trotsky

I am extremely astonished at your silence at such a
time when, according to information, albeit not fully
confirmed, the break-through in the Millerovo direction has
reached the dimensions of an almost irreparable
catastrophe.Â [1] What measures have been taken to prevent the enemy
joining forces with the insurgents?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Towards the end of May the front of the Soviet troops at
Millerovo was broken through, which resulted in the withdrawal of

 Â  

units of the Southern Front and allowed Denikinâs forces to unite
with Cossack insurgents in villages of the Upper Don.

Comrade Mezhlauk and Comrade Voroshilov
 Kharkov

A reply cannot be given before contacting Trotsky, whom
Sklyansky is informing by telegraph.

I confirm that reinforcements must be given to the
troops of the Southern Front without waiting for uniforms
or arms, as our Southern Front will see to that. I have
many times pointed out the catastrophic urgency of this
matter, but from you I have no exact information on the
actual number of reinforcements supplied by you to the
Southern Front.

It is necessary at all costs to put a stop immediately
to the habit of holding meetings, to put all work of
whatever kind on a war footing, and appoint particular
individuals responsible for the performance of precisely defined
jobs. There must be military discipline everywhere. The
Commander and Revolutionary Military Council of the 2nd
Army should make enquiries about everything of their
immediate chief, that is to say, Gittis, and put a stop to
all fanciful schemes for forming special groups and
similar attempts covertly to restore the Ukrainian Front. There
are sufficient uniforms and arms both in the Ukraine and
at the disposal of Gittis. If the chaos, the meetings and the
disputes about priority are eliminated, then everything can
be obtained. Report exactly the facts of the fulfilment of
specific orders, that is, about the arrival of army units
at their destination, the collection of arms, and so on.

Mezhlauk, Voroshilov
 Kharkov
 Copy to Melnichansky, Artyom, Kaminsky

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee met on
JuneÂ 1. In full agreement with Trotsky,, it firmly rejects
the plan of the Ukrainians to unite the 2nd, 8th and 13th
armies, and to create a special Donets
unity.[1]

We demand that Voroshilov and Mezhlauk fulfil their
direct taskâthat of building a strong Ukrainian army.
Tomorrow or the day after, Trotsky will summon you to
Izyum and give orders in more detail. Report more exactly,
more frequently and in a strictly factual way what you have
done and, in particular, how much army property
Voroshilov captured from Grigoriev and in other places.

On behalf of the Political Bureau of the C.C.,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the plan of the Ukraineâs army men to set up a
Revolutionary Military Council of the Donets Basin Front
subordinated to the Southern Front and consisting of the 2nd Ukrainian,
the 8th and the 13th armies. The plan was communicated to
Lenin from Kharkov on May 31 by a telegram from the
authorised agent of the Council of Defence.

On May 27, 1919, the C.P.C. heard a report by A.Â I. Svidersky,
a member of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food,
on the state of grain procurements and on plans for the food
procurement campaign before the next harvest. The Council decided
to publish Sviderskyâs report in the form of an article and to
transmit abroad by radio a short communication about it with
statistical data.

Leninâs instruction to the secretary was written on the text
of the prepared radio-information, which stressed that, in spite
of extremely adverse conditions (lack of commodities,
devaluation of the currency, seizure by whiteguards of the main
grain-growing regions), procurements of grain in 1919 were proceeding
more successfully than in the previous year: the Soviet food
supply organisations collected 102 million poods of grain during the
nine months (from August 1918 to April 1919) compared with
only 28 million poods during the ten months (from November
1917 to August 1918).

Sviderskyâs article âImmediate Food Prospectsâ was
published in Izvestia for June 3 and 4, 1919.

Zinoviev for Stalin
 Smolny
 Petrograd

Okulov points to the isolation of the 7thÂ Army from
the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front,
which causes confusion, relieves front workers of
responsibility, and deprives them of energy in their work.
Petrograd Military District, subordinated to the Western Front,
is giving all its reserves to the 7thÂ Army, not giving them
to the front for the remaining armies. Pozern stays in
Petrograd all the time, has poor connections with the
Council of the front, and sets up parallel supply bodies
instead of utilising the front-line bodies already existing.
Okulov proposes either the complete subordination of the
7thÂ Army to the command of the front, or giving it a special
status of direct subordination to the General Headquarters.

Knowing Petrogradâs constant tendency towards
independent activity, I think you should help the
Revolutionary Military Council of the front to unite all the armies.
The other Western armies besides the 7th should be taken
care of, too. Report what you have done.

The conflict with Okulov must not be allowed to grow.
Think it over well, for it is impossible simply to recall
him.

Today I learned of the desertion to the enemy of yet
another Petrograd regiment and of the refusal of two
regiments to attack. Supervision should be strengthened and
more workers added.

Regarding foreigners, I advise not to hurry with
deportation. Would not a concentration camp be better, so that
they can afterwards be
exchanged?[1]


Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
The text of the telegram from the words âThe conflict with
Okulovâ is in Leninâs handwriting.âEd.
 



[2]
This telegram concerns the situation on the Western Front and the
conflict between A.Â I. Okulov, a member of the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Western Front, on the one hand, and J.Â V.
Stalin, G.Â Y. Zinoviev and the leadership of the 7th Army, on
the other. In the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U., there are notes on this
question which were exchanged between Lenin and Sklyansky at a
meeting. Lenin wrote to Sklyansky: âStalin demands the recall
of Okulov, whom he accuses of intrigues and disorganisation.â
In answer to a note of Sklyanskyâs giving a favourable testimonial
of Okulov, Lenin gave the following directive to Sklyansky: âThen
draft the text of a telegram (a precise statement of what the 7th
Army is accused by Okulov) and I will send a code message to
Stalin and Zinoviev to keep the conflict within bounds and
channel it in the right direction.â The draft of the telegram published
here was drawn up in accordance with this directive and
afterwards supplemented and signed by Lenin.


On the subject of the recall of Okulov, see also this volume,

Sklyansky has positively promised 16 give ten thousand
rifles in the first half of June. Pay the most serious
attention to the Orenburg Cossacks and the Bashkirs, for during
the previous offensive we behaved stupidly, missed an
opportunity, and did not make use of these forces. Mobilise
them urgently, send an intelligent, cool, knowledgeable,
experienced man there, pay the greatest attention to this
and to unflagging, total mobilisation of the entire
front-line area and the collection of rifles from the population.

Revolutionary Military Council
 Southern Front

The Revolutionary Committee of Kotelnikovo District,
Don Region, by Order No.Â 27, abolishes the term âstanitsaâ
and establishes that of âvolostâ, and accordingly divides
Kotelnikovo District into volosts.

In various districts of the region the local authorities
forbid the wearing of trouser stripes and abolish the word
âCossackâ.

In the 9thÂ Army Comrade Rogachov is indiscriminately
requisitioning horse harness and carts from the working
Cossacks.
 

In many parts of the region local fairs for selling peasant
wares are prohibited. Austrian prisoners of war are being
appointed commissars in the stanitsas.

We call attention to the need to be particularly careful
in breaking up such trivial features of everyday life, which
are of no significance whatsoever in the general policy,
so as not to irritate the population. Pursue a firm course
on basic questions and be tolerant of the archaic survivals
to which the population is accustomed.

 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars

Comrade Chicherin,

1) What have you done to help this Indian?
 âin publishing his article?
 âin other respects?

2) We must push on with summaries, leaflets, maps
of the partition of the world

{{

by Great
Britain and
France

}}


â â â â Turkey
 â â â â colonies
 Persia, etc.
 etc.

3) What about the radio message concerning the â
ultimatumâ of the British workers? (Vecherniye Izvestia,
3.Â VI.)[2]

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs note to Chicherin was written in connection with a
letter from M.Â Barakatullah, an Indian professor, who wrote about
the struggle against British imperialism in India, and asked that
his article on Bolshevism he published âin order to win the
hearts of the Moslems to the support of Bolshevismâ.





[2]
The ultimatum mentioned in this note was presented to the
British Government by a delegation of the British Trades Union
Congress. The workers demanded that the government should not
interfere in the internal affairs of Soviet Russia and Soviet
Hungary and threatened a general strike if their demands were not
met.

Comrade Lads

Dear Comrade,

I have received your letter and enclosures. Kamenev
saysâand declares that several most prominent Cheka men
confirm itâthat the Chekas in the Ukraine have brought a
host of evils, having been set up too early and having
allowed a mass of hangers-on to get in.

A most stringent check should be made on personnelâin
this, I hope, Dzerzhinsky will assist you from here. It is
necessary at all costs to discipline the Cheka men and
throw out the alien elements.

When there is an opportunity to send a letter by hand,
inform me in greater detail about the screening of the
Cheka personnel in the Ukraine, and the results of the
work.

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

on this front are absolutely essential, the C.C. Politbureau

him at the disposal of Comrade Trotsky.

I think it necessary to release Natsarenus for the Ukraine,
which is badly in need of workers, while you have a
surplus. Further, I request you to visit the Western Front,
which has been terribly weakened as regards commissars.
It is absolutely essential to support the front as a whole.
Would you not find it useful in this connection to have a
meeting with Smilga?
 

I have received the material with your letter, and have
begun to examine it.

I am referring the question of Natsarenus to the Central
Committee. It must be borne in mind that there has been
a huge deterioration in the south, threatening catastrophe.
They are disastrously understaffed there, while you have
enough and to
spare.[1] I have informed Chicherin. I have
no objection, of course, to your orders to shoot
back.[2]

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JuneÂ 6, 1919, the Political Bureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
passed a decision to transfer S.Â P. Natsarenus to the Ukraine. In this
connection the following telegram was sent to Stalin: âPolitbureau
of C.C. has decided, in view of the extreme necessity of
immediately effecting unity of command in the Ukraine, to appoint
Natsarenus a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 14th
Army, formerly the 2nd Ukrainian Army. Lenin, Krestinsky,
Kamenev.â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 50, p.Â 490.)





[2]
This refers to repulsing Finnish whiteguards who were making
attacks on the Soviet frontier.

It was not at all a question of illegal organisations and
by no means of leaving
it.[1]

I am surprised that such a
strange idea could have entered your head. The question
was that of total mobilisation of all Tsaritsyn workers and
of using all methods of revolutionary, most energetic war
with especially stern purging of the rear. Telegraph precisely
what urgent measures you are adopting.

Trotsky

Representatives of the Bashkirs have visited me; they
ask for their troops to be sent to the east and not to the
south. In the east, in their home territory, they say, they
can help capture Chelyabinsk quickly, as the Kirghizes, too,
will go with them; but in the south they are powerless and
fear they will achieve nothing. I very much ask you to
weigh these arguments, which in my opinion are serious.

Make Sokolnikov hurry with suppression of the revolt.
We are giving Natsarenus to the south. Podbelsky is
working well in Tambov Gubernia, where he has roused the Army
Procurements Department and is procuring 20,000 pairs of
top-boots.

The situation in the south is so grave that it is
unlikely that we shall be able to give you reinforcements. You
will have to make a drive on mobilisation, sometimes total,

  Â  

in the front-line area, on local army procurements and
the collection of rifles from the population. Shoot those
guilty of concealing rifles. I consider the greatest danger
is a possible movement by Kolchak against Vyatka for
a break-through to Petrograd. Pay the most serious
attention to this, send information more often about the front
at Glazov. Sklyansky and I are sending reinforcements
there, although Muralov is oddly silent and does not
himself ask for reinforcements.

8/VI, 2.30Â a.m.

Comrade Sklyansky,

I have just received a telegram from Stalin and
Zinoviev. I hope you have already issued orders (it is essential!
extremity! 1/2 or 1/3, i.e., 2Â regiments from the Archangel
Front, 1 from the Eastern) and have already replied to
Zinoviev. If not, telephone him.

The capture of Izhevsk allows more to be taken from the
east (from the southern group of the east, of course).

Send me a reply.

More hostages from among the bourgeoisie and officersâ
families must be takenâin view of the more frequent
betrayals. Arrange it with Dzerzhinsky.

Send a telegram to Melnichansky (over my signature)
that it would be disgraceful to hesitate and not to shoot
for non-appearance.

One to Beloborodov, too, that it is necessary not to â
repelâ, but to annihilate the enemy, and to reply exactly
where and how many have been taken, what stanitsas, what
has been cleared and
how.[1]

Yours,
 Lenin

Beloborodov on JuneÂ 10, 1919, see the book: V.Â I. Lenin,

Give particular attention to the revolt in the Irgiz
area.[1]

Take prompt action, mobilise the entire
neighbourhood, discuss whether the insurgents can be crushed
by means of aeroplanes. Immediate and complete
suppression is essential. Why doesnât Gusev go out? There must be
no delay.

I again draw your attention that the regiments going

and command personnel. Attend to this yourselves. You
must take upon yourselves full responsibility for seeing
that these regiments do not betray.

While the Southern group of troops of the Eastern Front were

On JuneÂ 3, I sent the following telegram to Schlichter:
âEarnestly request you not to hold up consignments for the
Byelorussian-Lithuanian army and generally for the Food
Commissariat, Minsk, and to dispatch them to destination
in Minsk. Accelerate this in every way. Further, it is
necessary to increase relief for Petrograd. Please wire me
fulfilment of both assignments twice weekly. Lenin,
Chairman, C.P.C.â

Please
1) investigate the reasons for non-receipt of this
telegram and prosecute the guilty parties;
2) discuss most
urgently emergency measures to aid Petrograd with food
and to collect what was promised; appoint a comrade

in each volost responsible for fulfilment of this. I await
a reply.

Stalin, copy to Zinoviev
 Smolny
 Petrograd

Code message received. Both your requests Have been
fulfilled. Two armoured trains and 500 Communists are
leaving today. Trotsky is here. Telegraph, first, whether
you have received this reply; second, how you appraise the
situation, whether you have recovered what was lost,
and what measures have been taken; third, whether you
consider possible your arrival tomorrow or the day after
or quite impossible; fourth, your opinion about the
publication of the document you sent, not in full but parts of it.
I urge publication. We ourselves will select what can be
published. I await a
reply.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
On receiving Leninâs telegram, Stalin wrote on it a reply for
dispatch to Moscow: âWhat was lost has not yet been recovered. Heavy
crossfire is going on. Everything that could be sent has been sent
for operations by land. Obviously it is impossible and
inadvisable to leave for Moscow during those days. Postpone the plenum.
We have no objection to publication of part of the document....â

Stalin
 Smolny
 Petrograd

According to information from the sailors who captured
Krasnaya Gorka, an English naval force of twenty-three
vessels from Libau is expected to reach Kronstadt today,

  Â  

the 16th. I trust you have taken all measures. Send me a
map of the
front.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The counter-revolutionary mutiny at Fort Krasnaya Gorka, which
broke out during the night of JuneÂ 12, 1919, was put down
during the night of JuneÂ 15. Fort Seraya Loshad, which had joined
the rebels, also fell during the day of JuneÂ 16. Only a few hours
before the mutiny was suppressed, the Soviet command received
information that a British naval force of 23 ships had set out
from Libau to aid the Krasnaya Gorka mutineers. In view of the

 Â  

fact, however, that the Soviet fleet dominated the sea approaches
to Petrograd, the British command did not venture to begin
large-scale operations and was compelled to limit the activities of its
squadron to isolated actions.

Comrade Gusev
 Orgbureau of the C.C.
 Comrade Sklyansky

Will you please examine as quickly as possible the
proposals of Comrade I.Â I. Ulyanov so that the question
can be settled without delay.

Ivan Ivanovich Ulyanov, former Chairman of the Urals
Revolutionary Committee, a member of the All-Russia
Central Executive Committee (since X.Â 1917), urges the
necessity of raising a division from among the Cossack
proletarian masses in the area of Saratov and Pokrovsk
for operation behind the enemy lines, in the steppes beyond
the Urals.

Ulyanov himself, Khaustov (Chairman of the Bureau of
the Yaitsk Revolutionary Committee, in Pokrovsk), two
brothers of I.Â I. Ulyanov and a few others, whom he
undertakes to select, would like to take up the formation of
a special detachment.

Required for this are:


1) special powers;


2) arms and supplies;


3) money.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of Defence

16/VI. 1919

Comrade Trotsky is mistaken: here there are neither
whims, nor mischief, nor caprice, nor confusion, nor
desperation, nor any âelementâ of these pleasant qualities
(which Trotsky castigates with such terrible
irony).[1]
What there is, is what Trotsky overlooked, namely, that
the majority of the C.C. is convinced that General
Headquarters is a âdenâ, that all is not well at Headquarters,
and in seeking a serious improvement, in seeking ways
for a radical change it has taken a definite step.
That is all.

Lenin

Moscow, 17/VI. 1919
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the decision of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), dated JuneÂ 
15, 1919, on General Headquarters. In a statement to the C.C.
Trotsky opposed this decision, which he described as containing
âwhims, mischiefâ, etc.

To the Orgbureau of the C.C.: a general strike in Tver,
then in Klin, all this is creating an extremely menacing
situation. The following measures must he urgently
discussed:

to help the textile workers
emergency measures are needed:

when will you discuss?

a

food

1) See that the textile
workers (pay attention) are
provided with food at
operating factories.

2) Mobilisation of textile
workers ... (10,000) to be
reviewed.

Tver (and Klin) especially
 railwaymen and Red Army
 men
 to be supplied with food
 and taken care of.

3) Distribution of newspapers
and posters, lectures, step
up the work of the Peopleâs

  Â  

The Tver Military
Commissar is too inexperienced
in military matters; he is
very good, but requires 
assistance.

Commissariat for
Education.

4) Tickets (daily) on railways
for members of the C.C. of
trade union executives.

The ignorance of the textile workers is appalling.

No one takes care of them, they have no newspapers, no

 N.Â B. |||


posters. Something more must be done to improve the food
situation, something like purchases, etc.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter in connection with the strike of workers
at a number of enterprises of Tver Gubernia. The strike, which
broke out in the middle of June 1919 and lasted several days,
was caused by dissatisfaction among the workers over the
reduction of the bread ration and food supplies. Counter-revolutionary
elements tried to take advantage of the economic difficulties of
the Soviet Republic in order to inflame anti-Soviet sentiments.

The question of the food strikes was discussed at joint
meetings of the Politbureau and Orgbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
on JuneÂ 18 and 24, 1919. Special measures were taken to improve
the position of the workers of the textile district.

Have learned from Smilga about the revolt in Kustanai
and the advance of insurgents on
Chelyabinsk.[2] If these
are Hungarians and their friends, the crucial moment has
come. All efforts must be made to join forces. What are
you undertaking? Are you sending an aeroplane? If there
is no aviation mixture, probably some could be obtained by
putting on extra pressure. Wire me in greater
detail.[1]

Notes
 

[1]
At the top of the document Lenin added the words: âIn the
special âSovietâ code, which is known to Sklyansky, Medyantsev,
Smilga and Lashevich, but not known to army men in general.ââEd.
 



[2]
This refers to a revolt in the rear of Kolchakâs army.

The Kustanai partisans who broke through to the Soviet forces
were formed into a Communist Regiment which fought the
enemies of the revolution to the very end of the Civil War.

The right to vote must be given only to uyezd delegates
in strict accordance with the Constitution. I shall get in
touch at once with the Presidium of the Central Executive
Committee. You should both remain until complete quiet is
restored and the whole work is running smoothly.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telegram on JuneÂ 20, 1919, V.Â I. Nevsky and L.Â S. Sosnovsky
reported from Tver that the strike was at an end and all
enterprises were resuming work. They wrote that, over and above the
delegates constitutionally elected by the uyezd congresses for the
forthcoming Gubernia Congress of Soviets, the Gubernia
Executive Committee had invited an extra delegate from each volost
for the purpose of strengthening ties with the countryside. The
Gubernia Congress of Soviets decided to ask the C.E.C. to grant
the volost delegates the right to vote. Nevsky and Sosnovsky
objected to this, stressing that 80 per cent of the volost delegates
were non-Party, predominantly kulak elements, and they asked
Lenin to reply urgently.

The telegraph form on which Leninâs telegram was written
bears a note by him: âFiles.â

I have just learned from railwaymen that there has been
no railway connection with Tsaritsyn since the 18th. The
last station, they say, is Log. Is this true? If it is, why did
you conceal it and not report? What measures have been
taken to restore the situation? Have you given the 10th
Army sufficient reinforcements, cartridges and shells? If
insufficient, are you now giving these and by what route?
The 10th Army complains of a shortage. I draw your
attention again and again to the extremely great importance of
Tsaritsyn. Has a directive been given not to surrender
Tsaritsyn? Are you keeping to it decidedly, or is there a
different opinion? Reply precisely and urgently.

To Svidersky (or Tsyurupa): You must seize at it with
both hands. Send the food army there + food supply
workers.

Start an agitation among the starving workers: to the
Belaya for 5Â million poods. Reply what you are
doing.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JuneÂ 23, 1919, Lenin received a telegram from the River
Transport Administration Committee, reporting the existence of large
stocks of grain on the Belaya River and the need to expedite its
dispatch.

In reply to Leninâs inquiry, Svidersky reported that, in order
to expedite grain procurements on the Belaya River and in Ufa
Gubernia in general, M.Â I. Frumkin, a member of the Board of
the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, had gone there from Samara,
and that measures would be taken to send food army men to the
Belaya.

you can send here about a dozen Siberians who have come

Frunze

The development of enemy successes in the area of
Nikolayevsk is causing great concern. Report exactly whether
you have given sufficient attention to this area. What
forces are you concentrating and why are you not speeding
up concentration? Urgently report on all the measures you
are
taking.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his reply to Lenin on the same day, Frunze wired: âI have
devoted and am devoting the most serious attention to the
enemy operations on the Urals Front, particularly in the area
of Nikolayevsk, in view of the obvious danger of the Kolchak
and Denikin fronts linking up on the Volga. Unfortunately, in
this sector I have had at my disposal only weak units, completely
untrained and often poorly armed forces. All the rest were sent
against Kolchak at the time of his offensive against Samara and
until now have been engaged in the Ufa direction....â =

(Iz istorii
grazhdanskoi voiny v SSSR, Vol.Â 2, 1961, p.Â 234.) Frunze assured
Lenin that Uralsk and the entire northern part of the region
would be cleared of whiteguards within 10 to 14Â days. On July
11, 1919, the Red Army liberated Uralsk.

 Copy to Berkalov, Naval Firing Range, Petrograd

Impress upon your finance department the
impermissibility of levying an extraordinary tax on the special bonus
of 50,000 rubles received by Berkalov from the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars for an outstanding invention.

A decree exempting such rewards from taxation has been
adopted by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars and is now
in

On June 16, 1919, the C.P.C. received a telegram from military
engineer Y.Â A. Berkalov stating that the finance department of
the Porokhovo District Soviet of Petrograd had imposed an
extraordinary tax of 40,000 rubles on the 50,000 rubles granted to
Berkalov by a decision of the C.P.C. of NovemberÂ 26, 1918, as
a reward for his artillery invention (consisting in the discovery
of methods for long-range artillery fire and for increasing the
muzzle velocity of the shells).

The decision of the C.P.C. âOn Inventionsâ, dated JuneÂ 30,
1919, which laid down that rewards for inventions were exempt
from taxation, was published on JulyÂ 4 in Izvestia No.Â 144.

5/VII.1919

Dear Alexei Maximych,

You seem to stay too long in Petrograd, really. It is
not good to stay in one place. Itâs tiring and boring.
Would you care to take a trip? We can arrange
it.[1]

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin advised Gorky to âtake a tripâ on the propaganda steamer
Red Star, which was making a cruise on the Volga and Kama.
Krupskaya took part in this trip along with a group of
top-level functionaries of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), the C.E.C., and
various Peopleâs Commissariats. On JulyÂ 10, Lenin wired
Krupskaya: âI saw Gorky today and tried to persuade him to travel
on your steamer, about which I had sent a telegram to Nizhni,
but he flatly refused.â =

5/VII. 1919

Comrade Sklyansky,

Petrograders say the city has a lot ofÂ 

(1) shells,Â 
 

(2) guns on old ships (could do with thorn for the
Volga!),Â 

(3) field guns, up to 300.

Very strict measures must be taken urgently and a report
made to the Council of Defence on maximum speeding up
of shipments chiefly by water (itâs a crime that there have
been no shipments till now. We would have saved
Tsaritsyn).

Greetings,
 Lenin

âverification of the enclosed application;

âdraw up an exact, factual description of how many
houses, apartments and rooms are occupied (by what
number of persons) by office workers and higher technical

Notes
 
 



[1]
On July 3, 1919, the Bureau of the Womenâs Organisation in
Sormovo requested N.Â K. Krupskaya, who had come to Sormovo,
to help obtain a building from the Sormovo Works Management
for a childrenâs home. Housing belonging to the works could
be made over to other institutions only by an order of the Council
of Defence; hence the application of the Sormovo Womenâs
Organisation was forwarded to Lenin. Leninâs directive was
considered at a meeting of the Presidium of the Sormovo Soviet on
JulyÂ 18. The matter was referred for a final decision to the
Presidium of the Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia Executive Committee,

 Â  

which decided to meet the request of the Sormovo Womenâs
Organisation.

70,000, and between JulyÂ 1 and 7 to 22,000. If not received,

At the beginning of July the Command of the Southern Front asked
Lenin to permit a call-up of 18-year-old working men in
districts close to the front. Before putting the matter before the
Council of Defence, Lenin asked the All-Russia Chief
Headquarters for information about reinforcements sent to the Southern
Front. In reply to Leninâs telegram of July 8, the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Southern Front repeated its request. On
JulyÂ 11, 1919, the Council of Defence decided âto permit the
R.M.C. of the Southern Front to carry out mobilisation of
18-year-olds in the above-mentioned areasâ =

(Collected Works,
Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 378). In addition, the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Republic was instructed to adopt
measures for the immediate dispatch of the trained units to the
fronts, primarily the Southern Front.

Find out what has been done to organise the extraction
of oil from the shales of Syzran Uyezd and of Kazan
oil.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The text of Leninâs directive was quoted by N.Â P. Gorbunov,
head of the Science and Technology Department of the Supreme
Economic Council of the R.S.F.S.R., in the general plan drawn
up by him on July 14, 1919, outlining measures for the extraction
of oil, coal, sapropel, shales and fuel gases.

In the spring of 1919 a large expedition from the Chief Shale
Committee was sent to the Volga to organise the exploitation of
fuel shales and bituminous deposits in Undory, Kapshira (near
Syzran) and Syukeyevo.

In the second half of July and in August 1919, a number of
executives on the staff of the Chief Shale Committee, headed by
I.Â M. Gubkin, went to the Volga to check on the work of the
expedition and give it assistance. Included in the group were F.Â F.
Syromolotov, Chairman of the Chief Mining Board of the Supreme
Economic Council, and V.Â P. Nogin, who enlisted the coâ
operation of local Party and administrative organisations. The results of
the expeditionâs work were reported to Lenin (see I.Â M. Gubkinâs
contribution in the book Vospominaniya o Vladimire Ilyiche
Lenine [Recollections about Vladimir Ilyich Lenin], PartÂ 2, Moscow,
1957, pp. 300â19).

To Hanecki: draft a
reply.[1]

To Hanecki: this text will not do. It must be worded
thus: you have been promised so many millions within
such-and-such a period. We dispatched such-and-such an amount
to you on such-and-such a date and will send so much more
on such-and-such a date.

Draw up a text on these lines at once.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

J.Â Hanecki, a member of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Finance, was to draft a reply to Rakovskyâs telegram received
by Lenin on July 16,1919, requesting the dispatch of money that
had been promised in connection with the acute financial crisis
in the Ukraine. Hanecki drew up the following reply: âToday
300 is being sent, of which 50 are assigned for Kaluga. In future,
consignments will be made regularly.â =

On Haneckiâs reply Lenin

__PRINTERS_P_515_COMMENT__

Milyutin and Popov

Calculate approximately how many thousand million a
month we would need, ifÂ 

(1) grain prices are increased fivefold;
      (threefold)

(2) the prices on manufactured goods for the peasants
are not fixed, and increased as much as possible to the
price limit given by the peasant;

(3) breadstuffs and manufactured goods are sold to
workers and office employees at the old prices;

(4) calculations to cover also the Ukraine, the Urals,
Trans-Volga area, part of Western Siberia, and the Don;

(5) breadstuff prices are fixed according to districts;

(6) how many thousand million will be required if there
is a 10% increase in wages and salaries.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of establishing fixed prices for grain and
manufactured goods was discussed at a meeting of the C.P.C. on JulyÂ 22,
1919, and at further meetings of the Council on July 24 and 31.
The decision adopted on JulyÂ 31 laid down that the selling price
for workers and office employees would remain as before, and the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Food and the Board of the Supreme
Economic Council were directed not later than SeptemberÂ 1, 1919,
to sign and publish fixed prices for foodstuffs and manufactured
goods.

The Politbureau of the C.C. discussed your telegram
No.Â 277/c. It fully agrees with you about the danger of any
kind of waverings in the firm carrying out of the plan once
it has been
adopted.[3] The Politbureau fully recognises the
operational authority of the Commander-in-Chief and asks
you to make this clear to all top-level executives. The
Politbureau appoints Smilga, Serebryakov and Lashevich as
members of the Revolutionary Military Council of the
Southern Front in addition to the former
ones.[2]

This refers to the plan of struggle against Denikin drawn up by
the Commander-in-Chief, S.Â S. Kamenev. According to this plan,
the main attack was to be delivered by the left wing of the
Southern Front via the Don Region with a secondary attack in the
Kharkov direction. The plan was expounded in a directive of the
Supreme Command dated July 23, 1919 (see Iz istorii grazhdanskoi
voiny v SSSR, Vol.Â 2, 1961, pp. 499â500). On JulyÂ 27, 1919, L.Â D.
Trotsky sent a telegram to E.Â M. Sklyansky, Deputy Chairman
of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic, in which
he reported that âCommander of the Southern Front Yegoriev
considers Kamenevâs operational plan for the south to be wrong,
and in carrying it out does not expect successâ =

(Collected Works,
Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 381). This opinion, Trotsky wrote, was
shared by Sokolnikov, member of the Revolutionary Military
Council of the front, and Peremytov, Chief of Operations
Division,

Trotsky, Chairman, Revolutionary Military Council

While in the Ukraine, you, of course, ascertained the
position there. Please report the state of the troops, their
capacity to offer resistance to Denikin, whether, at last,
really serious measures have been taken there, whether
they are capable of defending themselves, whether they are
giving systematic instruction to the workers and peasants
about a secret organisation in Denikin-occupied localities,
particularly an organisation in his troops, as also
mobilisation of Ukrainians, and whether the Ukrainian Communists
realise the full gravity of the situation.

Dear Comrade Bela Kun,

Please do not worry too much and do not give way to
despair. Your accusations or suspicions against Chicherin
and Rakovsky have absolutely no foundation whatever. We
are all working in full accord. We are aware of Hungaryâs
grave and dangerous situation and are doing all we can.
But speedy assistance is sometimes physically impossible.
Try to hold out as long as you can. Every week is of value.
Build up supplies in Budapest, fortify the city. I hope you
are adopting the measures I recommended to the
Bavarians.[1]

Warmest greetings and a firm handshake. Hold on
with all your might, victory will be ours.

Yours,
 Lenin

Comrade Chicherin,

I have received your note and the radio message. I donât
think it is worth while taking this seriously and hastening
to reply. Let us rather wait and have the laugh on them.
Today we shall give it to the press as a joke, with a
directive to the editors to ridicule it thoroughly (hinting: are
they not going by the news from Budapest?) and call the
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries all the names
they deserve. We shall talk it over again when I arrive.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin, who was resting at Gorki on August 3 and 4, 1919,
apparently wrote this note in connection with the fact that at the end
of July and beginning of August 1919 strong rumours were current
in the West-European press, and were also spread by the Russian
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, about an imminent
replacement of the Soviet Government in Russia by a coalition
government (with the participation of Mensheviks and Socialistâ
Revolutionaries). =

Pravda on August 6 and Izvestia on August 8
published articles ridiculing these rumours, which reflected the
imperialistsâ hopes for the overthrow of Soviet rule in Russia with
the aid of social traitors, as had occurred in Hungary.

Council of Peopleâs Commissars

In view of the shortage
of available agitational and propagandist
literature, which is moreover of little use for Siberia, the Siberian
Affairs Commission has formed a special Literary Section which
should in the shortest space of time prepare for the press a number
of pamphlets, leaflets and posters of an agitational nature....

Comrade Vorovsky,

Please give all possible help.

It has been fully ascertained that only Petrograd can
provide workers for the cartridge factories. The Sestroretsk
Works and the Pipe Works must be made at all costs to
provide the necessary hands at once. Red tape is
impermissible, criminal, for without cartridges we are lost. Put
on all your pressure and see to fulfilment.

8/VIII.
To the Orgbureau of the C.C.

I have just again received from a reliable source
information that board members are starving (for example,
Markov in the Commissariat for Railways, and others).
I insist most emphatically that the Central Committee
1) direct the Central Executive Committee to issue to all
Commissariat board members (and those of similar status)
a grant of 5,000 rubles each;

2) put all of them permanently on specialistâs maximum
pay.

Itâs too bad, really, to have both them and their
families starving!!

Some 100â200 people must be helped out.

Dear Comrade Vladimirov,

Your being relieved of membership of the Revolutionary
Military Council does not at all signify even the slightest
dissatisfaction with you. Nothing of the kind. The Central
Committee was compelled to do it in order m general to
make a start at reorganising the R.M.C. of the Southern
Front. I am sure that nothing will be altered in your work
in closest contact with the R.M.C. Drop me a line, please,
saying you have received this letter and how things have
adjusted themselves along the new lines. Have there been
any impediments to your work, and if so, of what kind?

Greetings,
 Lenin

Smilga
 and present whereabouts of the Volsk Revolutionary
Committee

I sent you a letter and then received yours of the
16th.[1]

Trotsky is here and will stay for a week or so, I think.
I hope work with him will go smoothly. Would it not be
better for you to come here and reach an agreement? Keep
your temper, donât overdo things. If you do not come,
send news more frequently.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to Smilgaâs letter to the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
reporting on the grave situation at the Southern Front. âThe chief
and basic cause of our reverses,â he wrote, âlies in the inability
of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front to
command and control the troops.... The Revolutionary Military
Council, as now constituted, is ineffectual. Failure to understand
one another is so great that the idea of achieving any harmony
in the work is ruled out.â =

August 23, 1919

I have received from you samples of fruit from state
farms with report No.Â 4936 (dated 22/8, 1919), and would
kindly ask you not to do this in future, not to send fruit,
etc., but to supply me with information as to how fruit,
etc., from state farms is distributed: whether it is given
to hospitals, sanatoria, children, where precisely it goes
and how much of it. How many state farms have you, what is
the composition of their managements, how many send in
reports, how many have sent and for what period, etc.?

Notify the Food Research Institute tomorrow by special
memo that in three monthsâ time they must present exact
  Â  

and complete data on practical achievements in producing
sugar from sawdust.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note was apparently written during a meeting of the Council
of Peopleâs Commissars on August 26, 1919, at which the work
of the Food Research Institute was discussed. The C.P.C. decided
âthat a report by the Peopleâs Commissariat for Health and the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Food on the practical tasks of the Food
Research Institute be made within three months. Within the
same period, a report by the Food Research Institute to be made
on the techniques of producing sugar from sawdustâ. =

Fotieva
wrote on Leninâs note: âFulfilled 28.VIII.â

Apparently at the same sitting, Krasin wrote a note to Lenin
saying that 18Â lbs. of sugar could be obtained from one pood of
sawdust. Lenin wrote back in reply: âUnbelievableâ18 lbs. from
one pood!! 45 per cent??? Sugar content? %?â =

(Lenin Miscellany
XXIV, p.Â 29.) Lenin frequently reverted to this subject (see
present edition, Vol.Â 35, DocumentÂ 230).

 Â  

August 10, 1919, Mamontovâs cavalry broke through the front
in the vicinity of Novokhopersk and raided a number of towns
and villages This created a threat to the Soviet forces, made
offensive operations difficult, and upset the system of command and
supply in various places. Lenin considered it an urgent task to
organise the rout of Mamontovâs corps (see Collected Works, Fifth
Ed., Vol.Â 39, pp.Â 171â72). Mamontovâs corps was routed in
October-November 1919.

30.Â VIII.

Comrade Sklyansky,

Markov told me today that 7 troop-trains of the 21stÂ 
Division will now arrive daily, that the whole of it will
have come in about 4Â daysâ time (news about it was
delayed by the storm which disrupted the telegraph for two
days), and then one week more will be required for each
division. He is doing everything to speed up things.

Ought we not use the whole 21st, or part of it (the
larger), to utterly annihilate all âLashevichâs godsonsâ? Think
this over properly. The capture of âSokolnikovâs godsonâ
and complete destruction of âLashevichâs godsonsâ are
of great, immense importance.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

The note refers to the 21st Division redirected from the Eastern
Front to reinforce the troops of the Southern Front.

âLashevichâs godsonsââMamontovâs cavalry corps.

âSokolnikovâs godsonââF.Â K. Mironov, who had raised a
Don corps in the Saransk area and on August 23, 1919, organised
a revolt against the Soviets. The revolt was quelled by S.Â M.
Budyonnyâs cavalry corps.

 Copy to all railwaymen

In view of the forthcoming union of Soviet Russia and
Soviet Turkestan, it is essential immediately to strain all
efforts for repair of locomotives and rolling-stock. The
Council of Defence directs that all forces at depots and
repair-shops should be mobilised for this purpose. The
victory of the revolution and of the Red Army should be
utilised to improve the economic life of Turkestan and
Russia. Greetings to Red
Turkestan.[1]

On SeptemberÂ 1, 1919, a general meeting of trade unions was held
in Tashkent. After hearing Leninâs telegram, the meeting passed
a resolution which stated: â...Red Tashkent, in the name of Red
Turkestan, vows to fulfil all the assignments given us by the
centre, and the red banner, proudly unfurled over Turkestan, will not
falter in the hands of Red Tashkent.â =

Comrade Sklyansky and Comrade Smilga,

I know perfectly a certain comrade, who is a man of
absolutely exceptional loyalty,
bravery and energy (
especially as regards explosions and daring
raids).[1]


I direct:

(1) that he be given an opportunity to learn command
practice (all speed-up measures to be taken, particularly
for the reading of lectures and the like),Â 

what can be done?
 

(2) that he be charged with organising a special
demolition, etc., squad to operate behind the enemyâs lines.

Stalin
 Headquarters, Western Front

The Politbureau asks you to explain the motives for
your decision in regard to Marchlewski. We are surprised
that you countermand a decision of the Central Committee
all on your own without letting us
know.[1]

On behalf of the Politbureau,
 Lenin

September 1, 1919
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his reply to Lenin on September 2, 1919, Stalin wired that
on the day of Marchlewskiâs arrival to conduct negotiations with
the Lithuanians, the latter suddenly launched an attack.
Obviously, the telegram pointed out, the Lithuanians had used talk about
negotiations as a cover in order to lull the vigilance of the Soviet
Government. Stalin stated that he had not received any decisions
of the Central Committee about conducting negotiations. âToday,â
he wrote further, âour counter-offensive has begun. We have
issued an order to Front Headquarters to heighten vigilance and
not allow any envoys to pass the front line without its
knowledge and consent.â

N.B. |||

... The Revolutionary Military Council failed to pay due attention
to the reconnaissance report, and the Southern Front Commander
declared it to be a trifle, saying that even if the Cossacks did break
through, they would be caught in a trap.


...As a result of all this, about 290 trucks of Clothing and
Equipment Depot property were
left behind in Kozlov and plundered by
the Cossacks and population.


In view of this I consider it necessary to insist on a thoroughly
detailed investigation of the process of evacuation of the institutions
of the Southern Front Headquarters, and particularly the Clothing
and Equipment Depot, to be carried out by a commission consisting
of representatives of the
Revolutionary Tribunal of the Republic,
the Council of Defence,
and the Peopleâs Commissariat for State
Control.
 

Comrade Trotsky
 Comrade Dzerzhinsky
 and the Central Committee

I think the investigation should be instituted through
the
Vecheka.[1]

A.Â K. Paikes, Deputy Peopleâs Commissar for State Control,

of the Southern Front, concerning the evacuation of Southern
Front Headquarters from the town of Kozlov.

15/IX.

Dear Alexei Maximych,

I received Tonkov, and even before that and before
receiving your letter we had decided in the Central Committee
to appoint Kamenev and Bukharin to check on the arrests
of bourgeois intellectuals of the near-Cadet type and to
release whoever
possible.[1] For it is clear to us that there
have been mistakes here, too.

It is also clear that in general the measure of arrest

  Â  

applied to Cadet (and near-Cadet) people has been necessary
and correct.

Reading your frank opinion on this matter, I recall a
remark of yours, which sank into my mind during our talks
(in London, on Capri, and afterwards):

âWe artists are irresponsible people.â

Exactly! You utter incredibly angry words about what?
About a few dozen (or perhaps even a few hundred) Cadet
and near-Cadet gentry spending a few days in jail in order
to prevent plots like that of the surrender of Krasnaya Gorka,
plots which threaten the lives of tens of thousands of
workers and peasants.

A calamity, indeed! What injustice! A few days, or even
weeks, in jail for intellectuals in order to prevent the
massacre of tens of thousands of workers and peasants!

âArtists are irresponsible people.â

It is wrong to confuse the âintellectual forcesâ of the
people with the âforcesâ of bourgeois intellectuals. As a
sample of the latter I take Korolenko: I recently read the
pamphlet War, the Fatherland and Mankind, which he
wrote in August 1917. Mind you, Korolenko is the best
of the ânear-Cadetsâ, almost a Menshevik. But what a
disgusting, base, vile defence of imperialist war, concealed
behind honeyed phrases! A wretched philistine in thrall to
bourgeois prejudices! For such gentlemen 10,000,000 killed
in an imperialist war is a deed worthy of support (by deeds,
accompanied by honeyed phrases âagainstâ war), but the
death of hundreds of thousands in a just civil war against
the landowners and capitalists evokes ahs and ohs, sighs,
and hysterics.

No. There is no harm in such âtalentsâ being made to
spend some weeks or so in prison, if this has to be done to
prevent plots (like Krasnaya Gorka) and the death of tens of
thousands. But we exposed these plots of the Cadets and
ânear-Cadetsâ. And we know that the near-Cadet professors
quite often help the plotters. Thatâs a fact.

The intellectual forces of the workers and peasants are
growing and gaining strength in the struggle to overthrow
the bourgeoisie and its henchmen, the intellectual lackeys
of capital, who imagine they are the brains of the nation.
Actually, they are not the brains, but shâ.
 

To the âintellectual forcesâ who want to bring science
to the people (and not to act as servants of capital), we
pay a salary above the average. That is a fact. We take
care of them. That is a fact. Tens of thousands of officers
are serving in our Red Army and are winning victory,
despite the hundreds of traitors. That is a fact.

As for your moods, I can âunderstandâ them all right
(since you raise the question whether I shall be able to
understand you). Often, both on Capri and afterwards, I
told you: You allow yourself to be surrounded by the worst
elements of the bourgeois intelligentsia and succumb to
their whining. You hear and listen to the howl of
hundreds of intellectuals over the âterribleâ arrest for a few
weeks, but the voice of the masses, the millions, the
workers and peasants, whom Denikin, Kolchak, Lianozov,
Rodzyanko, the Krasnaya Gorka (and other Cadet) plotters
are threateningâthis voice you do not hear and do not
listen to. I quite understand, I quite fully understand,
that in this way one can write oneself not only into saying
that âthe Reds are just as much enemies of the people as
the Whitesâ (the fighters for the overthrow of the
capitalists and landowners are just as much enemies of the people
as the landowners and capitalists), but also into a belief
in the merciful god or our Father the Tsar. I fully
understand.

X

No really, you will go under unless you tear yourself
out of this environment of bourgeois intellectuals! With
all my heart I wish that you do this quickly.

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

X


For you are not writing anything! And for an artist to
waste himself on the whining of rotting intellectuals and
not to writeâis this not ruin, is it not shameful?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On SeptemberÂ 11, 1919, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
discussed the arrests of bourgeois intellectuals and directed
F.Â E. Dzerzhinsky, N.Â I. Bukharin and L.Â B. Kamenev to have
their cases reconsidered.

Trotsky, Serebryakov, Lashevich

The Politbureau of the C.C. considers it absolutely
inadmissible that Selivachov is still without special
supervision despite the C.C. decision. We insist on
communication being established, if only by aeroplane, and on
Serebryakov being sent to him immediately to act as
commissar to
Selivachov.[1] The behaviour of divisional
commanders in the area of the second break-through is
extremely suspicious. Take heroic precautionary measures.

The Politbureau directs Comrade Stalin to talk with the
Commander-in-Chief and reprove him for the inadequacy
of his measures to establish communication with Selivachov
and prevent suspicious negligence, if not treachery, in the
area of the second break-through;Â 

âfurther, to reprove the Commander-in-Chief for the
extreme passivity of Olderogge and point to the necessity
of taking measures either by replacing him by a more
energetic commander (discuss the question of Frunze), or by
sending highly reliable and energetic commissars, or by both.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At a joint meeting of the Politbureau and Orgbureau of the C.C.,
R.C.P.(B.) on SeptemberÂ 18, 1919, it was decided to cancel the
decision about sending Serebryakov to Selivachov.

In a letter to Lenin dated September 26, 1919, Chicherin asked
that the question of a new peace proposal to the Entente should
be discussed in the C.C., R.C.P.(B.). Chicherin wrote that an
official proposal from the government could be addressed to the
Entente, or Gorky could be asked to write a letter pointing out
the Soviet Governmentâs invariable readiness to sign peace. Lenin
wrote on Chicherinâs letter: â...Not in the name of the
government.... Confine ourselves to Gorkyâs letter....â =

Comrade Sklyansky,

The question of reinforcing the division taken from the
Eastern Front must be urgently worked up.

Cannot we add to it 20â30% of new recruits? Mobilised
workers? Perhaps 5% of Communists, 15% of workers, 10% of
peasants? Then it would be augmented by 30%. Perhaps this
is technically admissible (without weakening the whole
division as regards toughness)?

This must be urgently considered and decided.

Further, the dispatch of rifles to the Eastern Front must
now be stepped up.

Should not the Eastern Front be given the following
assignment: to consider and carry out a regrouping of the
troops so as to reinforce all the divisions by 15â30 per cent

  Â  

and thereby bring the whole army up to its previous
strength?

Lenin

Comrades,

Comrade Yunosov told me about your case. I heard him
out attentively and reached the conclusion that the case
was decided correctly and in your favour, since the person
who uttered those thoughtless and profoundly unjust words
had been reprimanded.

That is enough. You are vindicated, he stands accused.
I earnestly request and advise you now to put aside all
recollection of it and forget the whole matter.

I am sure that all the workers will now make for the
front. Denikin is pressing hard, the danger is serious.

With comradely greetings,
 Lenin

Dear Vladimir Ilyich,

Not knowing whether,
among the mass of
radio messages, you have
read about Kautskyâs
book, I am sending you
this excerpt separately.
It seems to me, from
what I am able to read
of our literature, that
we have not thrown
sufficient light on the role
of state capitalism under
proletarian political
power, a role which has
escaped Kautsky. What
we have is not yet
communism, but state
capitalism, with
inequality of remuneration
including piecework
payment, with forms of
compulsion, sometimes
reproducing the old
regime, with centralised
management even of
production and a restricted
factory
 ???
 ||| 

selfâ
administration. We have a Red
Army of state capitalism
with an apparatus of
very strong compulsion,
and not an army of
communism....

Unfortunately, there
is almost no real
centralisation.

This is
altogether wrong. 

This is not a sign
of capitalism.

This is due to the
forms of struggle
of the enemy and
the level of
culture and not due
to capitalism.


# 
I donât think so. We have the struggle of the first
stage of the transition to communism with peasant and
capitalist attempts to defend (or to revive) commodity
production.

Lenin

Dear Friends,

I send you best greetings. Our position is very difficult
owing to the offensive of 14Â states. We are making the
greatest efforts. The communist movement in all countries is
growing remarkably. The Soviet system has everywhere
become a practical slogan for the working masses. This
is a step forward of tremendous world-historic significance.

  Â  

The victory of the international proletarian revolution,
despite everything, is inevitable.

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

The Central Committee has instructed a commission
consisting of Lenin, Trotsky, Krestinsky, and Kamenev



âto prepare a report on the search for all kinds of
property suitable for military purposes and military
supplies, and providing for severe measures of
punishment for concealmentâ.



This commission decided to set up a subcommission of
the above-named comrades (from the Supreme Economic
CouncilâSyromolotov or Milyutin, or someone from its
Transport and Materials Department, etc., by agreement
between us and the Presidium of the Supreme Economic
Council) and instruct it to draft a decree by Saturday (to
be submitted to the Council of
Defence).[1]

A.Â I. Svidersky, A.Â I. Rykov and E.Â M. Sklyansky, with
instructions, âif agreement is reachedâ, =

to present the decision for Leninâs
signature by Monday, OctoberÂ 20. The Council of Defence discussed
also the question of the search for property suitable for military
purposes. On OctoberÂ 31, 1919, the Council of Defence endorsed
a decision for the review of warrants and assignments for
military property and a decision on the search for property suitable
for military purposes.

The tardiness shown by you and other executives in the
matter of entraining the cavalry is outrageous.

I warn you that the functionaries responsible for
military work in Tula are obliged to display the greatest energy
and efficiency, which I do not see in practice. Send me at
once an explanation of the reasons for the delay. I shall

  Â  

call the culprits to strict account. I demand that the dispatch
be expedited to the utmost of your power.

17/X.

Comrade Trotsky,

Last night in the Council of Defence we adopted a
decision of the Council and sent it to you in code (it would
be better for you to use your own code, as Karakhanâs,
used by Zinoviev, causes a delay of several hours).

As you see, your plan has been adopted.

But the withdrawal of the Petrograd workers to the south,
of course, is not rejected (it is said that you expanded on
this to Krasin and Rykov); to talk about this prematurely
would mean diverting attention from the struggle to the
last.[2]

The attempt to envelop and cut off Petrograd, of course,
will call for corresponding changes, which you will carry
out on the spot.

Instruct some reliable person in each department of the
Gubernia Executive Committee to collect Soviet papers and
documents in preparation for evacuation.

I enclose the appeal which the Defence Council
instructed me to draw
up.[1]

 

I was in a hurry and it is none too good.

Better put my signature beneath your appeal.

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
This refers to the appeal: âTo the Workers and Red Army Men
of Petrogradâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 30, pp.Â 68â69).âEd.
 



[2]
Lenin is referring to the decision of the Council of Defence dated
OctoberÂ 16, 1919. It contained a directive to defend Petrograd
to the last drop of blood, without yielding an inch of ground
and fighting in the streets. In his proposed plan of struggle against
Yudenichâs forces, Trotsky also spoke of the need to prepare
for street fighting in the city. But, in issuing its main directive
for holding Petrograd at all costs until the arrival of
reinforcements, the Council of Defence allowed for street fighting only if
the enemy succeeded in penetrating into the city, whereas Trotskyâs
argument was different. He asserted that âfor purely military
considerationsâ it would be advantageous to allow the enemy to
break into Petrograd which should therefore be converted into âa
big trap for the whiteguard troopsâ.

1) Give 30,000 uniforms.

2) The entire 5thÂ Army to be taken to the south at once, and
not after the Ishim (for the river Tobol is much larger and
broader than the river Ishim, and the length of the front
when transferred to the river Ishim is insignificantly
shortened).

3) Turn the offensive in the direction of the Ishim into
a demonstration and withdraw (having prepared for this
in the shortest space of time) to the river Tobol.

Instruct the Commander-in-Chief to discuss my
proposals 1â3.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin on Smirnovâs telegram which reported that
âthe morale in Siberia is a firm, Soviet one. By organising local
forces, =

we shall cope with Kolchak; =

all that is needed are uniforms
and cartridges. =

Yesterday we went over to the offensive along the
whole front, and expect to reach the Ishim in three weeksâ. =

Further, mention was made of the desire of the Communists of the
5th Army that the army be transferred to the Southern Front.
Smirnov proposed that after the Ishim three divisions of this army
should be transferred to the south. âIf you provide uniforms for
30,000,â he wrote, âwe shall immediately =

mobilise this number of
soldiers in Chelyabinsk and the place to which we are going. =

Send
only uniforms; we have and will have all the manpowerâ =

(
underlinings by Lenin) (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 388).

The document bears a note by Lenin asking that the telegram
be returned to him.

Frunze
 Revolutionary Military Council of the Turkestan Front

Give all your attention, not to Turkestan but to the
complete liquidation of the Urals Cossacks, even if you
have to use diplomatic
means.[1] Make every effort to
speed up help for the Southern Front. Could not the
Orenburg Cossacks be taken to the front near Petrograd or some
other front? Report more frequently in code on actual
fulfilment.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The situation on the Southern Front becoming extremely acute,
the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) and the Soviet Government demanded that
the military command should first of all eliminate the
whiteguard forces which might co-operate closely with Denikinâs army.
The Urals White Cossack army of General Tolstov, being adjacent
to the right flank of Denikinâs front, was in a position to make
contact with Denikinâs forces. It operated in the North Caspian
area and diverted to itself troops of the Turkestan Front as well as
part of the forces of the 11th Army of the South-Eastern Front.

TrotskyÂ 

I think that agreement with Estonia against Yudenich is
impossible, for she is powerless to do anything even if she
wanted to. Moreover, Yudenichâs base is probably not in
Estonia, but outside it, on the sea coast covered by the
British fleet. We have sent you many troops, everything
depends on the speed of the offensive against Yudenich and
on encircling him. Strain all efforts to hasten matters.
The huge revolt in Denikinâs rear in the
Caucasus[1] and
our successes in Siberia raise hopes of complete victory,
if we immensely hasten the liquidation of Yudenich.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the spring of 1919 Denikin seized Daghestan, Chechen, Ossetia
and other national areas of the Northern Caucasus. The mountain
peoples responded with a holy war against the whiteguards.
Bourgeois-nationalist elements tried to take the leadership of
this insurrectionary movement into their hands. However, they

 Â  

did not succeed in winning over the main mass of the mountain
people. Under the leadership of the Caucasian Regional
Committee of the R.C.P.(B.), explanatory work was carried out
among the insurgents on a large scale and Communist
organisations were formed among the partisan forces. The insurrectionary
movement rapidly assumed a Bolshevik character.

Kharlamov was organised in the Kolpino-Tosno area. This group
was to deliver an attack against the enemy in the Krasnoye
Selo-Gatchina direction. At the same time the command of the Western
Front planned a general counter-offensive by the 7th and 15th

of Gatchina-Volosovo-Yamburg, and the 15th Army in the
Pskov-Luga area.

There are reports that fraternising has begun between
the Polish soldiers and
ours.[3] Check on this as accurately
as possible and report what measures you are
taking[1]

in

  Â  

order that impostors and enemy ruses shall be rendered
completely harmless, and so that thoroughly useful people
or commissars take part in the fraternising. Report
everything you know about the temper of the Polish
soldiers.[2]

The Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.C., C.P.S.U. contain an extract from a reconnaissance report
of NovemberÂ 17, 1919, which states that in the vicinity of Disna
fraternisation took place with Polish soldiers and the lower
ranks of the Polish officers. The document bears a note by Lenin:
âThis is very important! Send copies to Comrade Trotsky for all
members of the Politbureau.â

22/X. 1919

Comrade Trotsky,

I was somewhat taken aback by Zinovievâs demand
yesterday for more regiments. Is it true about the
Estonians?

Nevertheless, I passed it on to Sklyansky, and an order
has been given to have them sent from Tula (again from
Tula!).

It is not safe, however, to take any more from the
reserves of the Southern Front. Would it not be better to
search elsewhere?

It is devilishly important for us to finish with Yudenich
(precisely to finishâto deal a final blow). If the offensive
has begun, is it not possible to mobilise another 20,000
Petrograd workers and exert really mass pressure on
Yudenich?

If there are 5â10 thousand good attacking troops (and
you do have them), then surely a city like Petrograd can
give about 30thousand to follow up,
as an aid to them.
Rykov says that a great deal of property has been âfoundâ
in Petrograd; there is bread, and meat is on the way.

It is necessary to finish with Yudenich soon; then we
shall turn everything against Denikin.

In my opinion it is dangerous to take units from the

  Â  

Southern Front now: they have started an offensive there,
and it must be extended.

Greetings,

Lenin

P.S. I have just learned from Sklyansky that 2 regiments 
 intended for
Petrograd have reached Kotlas. We shall 
 expedite their
movement.[1]


New information: this is not true.

Comrade Trotsky,

In my opinion, Chicherin is
right.[1] Has it been
verified that the Estonians are fighting? Is there not deception
here? Or is it not only White Estonians (officers) who have
joined Yudenich, people who constitute a minority, and
an insignificant one, among the Estonians?

We must think it over ten times, measure the cloth ten
times, for there is a mass of information pointing to a
desire for peace on the part of the Estonian peasantry.

Greetings,
 Lenin

22/X.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter to Lenin dated October 22, 1919, Chicherin objected
to Trotskyâs proposal for starting a war against Estonia. He wrote
that Yudenich would have to be pursued on Estonian territory
only if he retreated there. Chicherin pointed out the need to do
everything to avoid invading Estonia.

 Petrograd

The Commander-in-Chief wires rejection of the request
for dispatch of a brigade over and above the railway

  Â  

regiment and 2 regiments of the 6th Army, of which one is
already en route. I think this is correct, because there
is nowhere to take them from, and extremely fierce fighting
is still in progress in the south near Orel. For the time
being, reinforcements of 1,500 will be sent to you.
Measures have been taken to send Letts in addition, if they
can be found. It is proposed to give you 600 men from the
Soviet
School.[2]

Comrade Smilga and other members of the R.M.C. of the
 Front and Armies

I strongly recommend the bearer, Comrade Stepan
Nazarov, a Bolshevik, whom I have known personally for a
long time.

He and other Ivanovo-Voznesensk comrades have formed
an intelligently organised group (of from 300 to 500 men)
for all-round service to and revitalisation of the whole
army.

I warmly recommend the comrades and earnestly request
that all measures be taken to ensure they will not be lost,
but allocated correctly and carefully. I particularly ask
to be informed of the receipt of this letter and of where
and how the comrades are assigned.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was written in connection with the departure for the
front of Ivanovo-Voznesensk Communists who had been called

 Â  

up. A meeting of the city Party organisation took place in
Ivanovo-Voznesensk on OctoberÂ 3. It called on every member of the
Party to devote himself to the cause of routing Denikinâs army
and instructed the Party organisations to begin mobilising
Communists for the front. The first party of mobilised men were
seen off to the front on OctoberÂ 22. On OctoberÂ 24, the
mobilised Ivanovo-Voznesensk Communists arrived in Moscow. Lenin
made a speech to them in the House of Trade Unions (see 
Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 39, p.Â 238). Fifty of the
Ivanovo-Voznesensk Communists were sent to the Headquarters and the
Political Department of the South-Eastern Front and the
remainder to the 9thÂ Army.

Comrade Rothstein,

It is unforgivable your keeping us so poorly informed.
To have money and not to engage a secretary to collect all
socialist literature, pamphlets, and cuttings. To have
money and not to arrange for photographing copies in reduced
size. All this is inexcusable. All this can and should be
arranged. Otherwise communication and information are
thoroughly bad. Correct this, and write, if only rarely.

Best greetings,
 Lenin

 Comrade Kugushev,

I have a favour to ask of you. Lydia Alexandrovna
Fotieva, whom I have known well since before 1905 and with
whom I have been working for a long time in the C.P.C.,
is travelling to Ufa.

L.Â A. Fotieva is quite ill and it is our business to repair
this âstate propertyâ (C.P.C. secretary). Will you please
take all steps to help L.Â A. Fotieva get fixed up, have
medical treatment, and be fed to bursting point.

Comrade A.Â D. Tsyurupa has told me that you know
L.Â A. Fotieva and will not refuse to help her.

I thank you in advance; please drop me a line by
messenger (military, for example) that you have received this
letter.

With comradely greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)

Deputy Peopleâs Commissar for Health

Comrade Solovyov,

1) Look through my remarks and return them, please,
with your comments.

2) Are there any statistics as to the total number of
doctors in Moscow?

3) Have any data on the physician-population ratio been
published (where and when)?

4) âditto: methods of control over doctors (that they
are not superfluous, that they are registered)?

5) Ratio (and number) of doctors in Petrograd?

6) âin other towns?

7) Ought we not publish statistics of the number of
doctors and ratio for verification?
Briefly, in the newspapers,
so that everyone can check?

Greetings,
 Lenin

 Petrograd

The entire military and political situation requires the
speedy concentration of very great forces near Petrograd,
in order to crush Yudenich once and for all. I advise that
this be implemented through the Commander-in-Chief or
through the Politbureau.

Frunze, copy to Sundukov, Zul

The struggle against the Urals Cossacks is dragging out.
I do not see any measures taken to finish with this front
quickly, despite the fact that I demanded that you
concentrate all your attention on
this.[1]

I inform you that
the enemy is gaining strength, using the respite you have
given him, and trying to end matters by a truce only.
Report at once what measures you have taken to rout the
enemy.

Trotsky

I thought Chicherin had informed you that he was
notifying the Estonians of our offensive against them if they
let Yudenich in. I think we ought to enter Estland if they
let Yudenich in, and, if this threat is real, we must speed
things up by vehement
action.[1] Chicherin is against making
this public, for then the Entente would adopt their own
measures.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On Novembers, 1919, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
accepted the idea of the Red Army crossing the Estonian frontier
to complete the rout of Yudenichâs whiteguard forces. On
NovemberÂ 14, however, this decision was rescinded at a meeting
of the Politbureau which noted that under pressure from the
working population the Estonian Government was agreeing to
resume peace negotiations and, apparently, would not support
Yudenich.

On DecemberÂ 5, 1919, a peace conference of the R.S.F.S.R.
and Estonia opened in the town of Yuriev (Tartu), at which an
agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the R.S.F.S.R.
and Estonia was signed (DecemberÂ 31, 1919). On FebruaryÂ 2,
1920, a peace treaty between Soviet Russia and Estonia was
concluded.

Re the report submitted for 1919:

1) It is desirable to publish the results in 
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn (and send me 1Â copy).

2) There are plenty of detailed tables, but no summary
tables:

âcomparison of production in 1918, 1919 and earlier
(number of days? % of machines in operation? etc.)

âconcise map? or distance from railway stations?

âconditions for setting in motion all machines?

âcomparable data on production in relation to
consumption (food and manufactures)?

The first has come to help the Soviet government. He
is our guest. Assistance is essential.

The second is a founder of Finnish Social-Democracy.
An old man. The Finns helped us very considerably before

1) Keeley, an American engineer, who has come to help
the Soviet government


  (in particular, sugar, chocolate, confectionery).
     Hotel National, No.Â 321.

2) Ursin (founder of Finnish Social-Democracy).
     Hotel Metropole, No.Â 471
        (in particular, butter).

Greetings,
 Yours,

[2]
Lenin is referring to Weissbrotâs telegram of November 20, 1919,
reporting on the extremely grave situation created in Orenburg
by the spread of a typhus epidemic. The absence of firewood and
lack of medical personnel made it difficult to combat the epidemic.
For the fight against typhus, Weissbrot pointed out, it was
necessary to increase the number of hospital beds in Orenburg to five
thousand and to transfer an additional two hospitals.

27. XI. 1919

Comrade Semashko,

(1) Please return the enclosed to me with your comments.
 

(2) Have the facts verified (get responsible persons to
state these facts quickly and accurately above their
signatures).

(3) Weissbrotâs plan. Your amendments or counter-plan?

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with a report from B.Â S. Weissbrot dated
November 5, 1919, concerning the supply of doctors for the Red
Army. Weissbrot pointed out that there was a surplus of doctors
in the medical institutions of Moscow and urged the need to call
up doctors and send them to the front. Lenin marked off the
passage in the report which said that some institutions, for instance,
the clinics of the Second Moscow State University, had more
doctors exempted than they had altogether before the imperialist
war, and wrote âN.B.â in the margin and a footnote saying:
âCheck this fact =

carefully and at once.â On another page, where
Weissbrot pointed to the existence in Moscow of unnecessary
medical establishments, Lenin noted: âhow many of them are
there?â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 394.)

Supreme Economic Council

Comrade Milyutin,

Please discuss the drafting of uniform, brief, but
essential questions (or forms) for printing periodic reports in
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn on the results of work for the
development of productive forces (the number of employed
workers; production, extraction; productivity per worker,
etc.) in all or in the main branches of the economy.

Let me have your opinion.

Lenin

The reports must be divided into 2 parts:

(a) a part which can only be described (plan, conditions,
specific features, etc.);

(b) a part which can and should be expressed in figures.

Both to be published.

In the second part, essentials to be selected (for
summaries and comparisons).

(Cf. an example of vaguenessâthe Chief Shale Committee,
report on OctoberÂ 1, 1919.) It is being printed. Where.
How often.

(The secret part should be printed in %Â %; for example:
OctoberÂ 1, 1919â100, number of workers; NovemberÂ 1,
1919â120, etc.)

I think somebody should be elected also from Kiev

Gubernia.[1]

When there is an All-Ukraine Central Executive
Committee (so far there is none), then they will leave.
Why should they not be with us so long as there is no
Ukrainian C.E.C.?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin proposed that a representative from Kiev Gubernia be
included in the C.E.C. His proposal was adopted. K.Â Tolkachov
was elected as the representative from Kiev Gubernia to the

Y.Â D.,

A code message must be sent that nobody anywhere should
ever use the nickname Kamo, which should
immediately be replaced by another, a new one. The town where
Kamo is must be mentioned only in code.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note was written on a letter from S.Â M. Kirov and I.Â P.
Babkin dated DecemberÂ 9, 1919, concerning the situation in the
Caucasus. The letter stated that there was no exact information
whether Kamo had arrived in Baku.

In the autumn of 1919, Kamo, at the head of a combat group,
was sent secretly from Moscow with arms, munitions and
literature to carry out underground work in the Caucasus. Overcoming

 Â  

all difficulties, the group arrived safely in Baku and joined in
the struggle against the Denikinites.

Orgbureau of the C.C.

In my opinion, Frunze asks too much. We must first
capture the whole of the Ukraine, Turkestan can wait and
make the best of it for a
time.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a conversation by direct line with members of the Turkestan
Commission, Frunze said: âThe refusal to send top-level
political workers is due to the big demands of the Southern Front and
the Ukraine.... By our efforts we have succeeded in getting... a
few people for both the political and the technical jobs.â =

Your demands for personnel are excessive. It is
absurd, or worse than absurd, when you imagine that
Turkestan is more important than the centre and the
Ukraine. You will not get any more. You must manage with
what you have, and not set yourselves unlimited plans,
but be modest.

The rapid advance of the army demands the immediate
organisation of Soviet institutions locally. The local comrades are
unfamiliar with the development and policy of Soviet power and are not
capable now of organising them. Contact with the centre being
impossible, the absence of suitable leaders in the regions threatens a
repetition of stages already passed and an irrational use of
Siberiaâs
natural wealth. It is essential to send responsible
people immediately
to the Siberian Revolutionary Committee for political leadership
in the fields of Soviet construction and economy.

Paikes
  Â  

     Orgbureau
        (to Stasova)

In my opinion, no more should be given to Siberia: we
have none. Siberia will not perish. Everything to the
Ukraine.

15. XII.

Comrade Zinoviev,

I am sending you the decision of the Politbureau.

Two things:

1) Cannot 2Â heavy sledges (Regress sleigh-cars) and 2
light ones be ordered urgently for the Southern Front?

Urgent. Reply.

2) Give special attention to the fuel shales near Yamburg.


It is of prime importance to exert the utmost efforts.

3) Materials (barbed wire and so on) must not be
squandered or pilfered.

They will be needed. Attend to it.

Greetings,
 Lenin

I am writing the article. If I donât finish it today, donât
wait.[1]

This note was apparently written in connection with the
discussion at a meeting of the Council of Defence on December 17,
1919, of a report by L.Â B. Krasin: âOn Drawing Up Forms of
Accounting Enabling the Work of the Railways To Be Kept Under
Review.â =

The final decision on this question was put off until the
next meeting; the Council of Defence instructed Y.Â V. Lomonosov,
member of the Board of the Commissariat for Railways, to submit
a report on the forms of accounting giving statistical data (âsuch
formsâ, the decision stipulated, âmust be briefer than those
presented by Comrade Krasinâ). On DecemberÂ 24, the Council of
Defence endorsed the programme of measures set forth by
Lomonosov, and instructed the Peopleâs Commissariat for Railways
âto present it tomorrow to Comrade Lenin for signature in the
form of a series of decreesâ (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51,
p.Â 396).

The document bears a note in an unknown hand: âExecuted
19.XII.â

Orgbureau

I propose either reprimanding the signatories to this
paper (their names, 32 persons, can be learned from their
previous
paper)[1]
 

orÂ 

reproving them for their gossip about the policy of the
C.C., R.C.P., which is a violation of discipline and an
obstacle to organised and harmonious work;

âfor, without indicating anything concrete, these
people are wasting valuable time and diverting attention
from speediest departure to the Ukraine for work there.

The C.C. calls on them to cease their gossip and
project-mongering and get down to work immediately,
strictly carrying out the policy and instructions of the C.C.,
R.C.P.

Lenin

P.S. The signatories must be kept under supervision and
distributed separately among business-like personnel.
Otherwise there will be squabbling, and not work.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the autumn of 1919 a group of âfederalistsâ, headed by G.Â 
Lapchinsky, P.Â Popov and Y.Â Lander, was formed in the Communist
Party of the Ukraine. The group took a bourgeois nationalist
stand and started factional splitting activities. On DecemberÂ 13,
1919, the federalists called a meeting of 32 of their supporters,
at which they declared against the policy of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
towards the Ukraine. Popov and Lander signed a statement on
behalf of 32 Ukrainian Party functionaries criticising the
composition of the Bureau of the C.C.,Â C.P.(B.) of the Ukraine and
its methods of work, and protesting against Party and
administrative functionaries for the Ukraine being mobilised from Russian
gubernias.

On December 18, 1919, the Orgbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
examined the declaration of the Ukrainian Party functionaries
and decided âto reprimand them because, instead of doing
positive work in accordance with the directive of the All-Ukraine
Revolutionary Committee and the Bureau of the C.C.,Â C.P.(B.) of
the Ukraine, they are wasting time and energy in gossip and

 Â  

irresponsible political chicanery, which is a violation of Party
discipline....â

Comrade Eliava,

I recommend to you the bearer, Comrade P.Â N.
Lepeshinsky,[1] whom I know from abroad, from the Geneva of
1902, where we fought together against the Mensheviks.
Comrade Lepeshinsky will undoubtedly assist in just the
kind of work that should impress upon the indigenous
population the idea and conviction that Soviet people
cannot be imperialists, cannot even have imperialist ways of
behaviour.

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrades,

At your conference on December 19 you decided to
dispatch 800 truck-loads of potatoes within ten days for
Moscow workers and outlined a number of measures for carrying
this out. A splendid idea, but the crux of the matter is
how successfully and how quickly you will cope with the task
you have set yourselves. The working class of Moscow is
in the throes of starvation. Saving it means saving the
revolution. The working class of Moscow has been bearing
the brunt of the struggle against counter-revolution. The
Red Army has defeated Kolchak and Yudenich, it is now
Denikinâs turn. To enable the Red Army, with the least
expenditure of time and strength, to cope with this task,
which will ensure the possibility of ending the war and
beginning peaceful socialist construction, the Moscow
worker has had to make yet another sacrifice. He has had to
provide for operational needs the transport facilities which
were intended for the carriage of food to Moscow. In these
conditions, it is natural that localities surrounding the
centre of world revolution should come to his aid. All
Party and Soviet personnel should be imbued with the idea
that the provisioning of Moscow, the salvation of its
working class, is their sacred revolutionary duty. On your
energy and determination depend the gains of the
revolution. All for food procurement, all for work to load and
dispatch the trucks. The dispatch and delivery of food
trains to Moscow is the care of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Railways. Insistently demand fulfilment of this

  Â  

obligation from the local bodies of the Commissariat for
Railways. To work, comrades! For speedy, drastic,
revolutionary aid to the Moscow workers!

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On DecemberÂ 21, 1919, a letter signed by Lenin was sent also
to the Party Committee and Executive Committee of Tula
Gubernia. It stressed the need for sending not less than 400
truckloads of potatoes to the Moscow working people within the next
ten days. âOn your achievements, energy and determination,â
the letter stated, âdepend the salvation of the working class, the
consolidation of the gains of the revolution, and its farther
successes and final triumph.â =

[1]
This note was apparently written in connection with a sitting
of the Narrow Council of Peopleâs Commissars on December 18,
1919, which discussed a request from the Moscow Gubernia
Executive Committee for the cancellation of a circular of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Internal Affairs on the use of church buildings
for school purposes. The Narrow C.P.C. resolved to reject the
request of the Moscow Gubernia Executive Committee, and to
direct the Peopleâs Commissariats for Education, Justice and
Internal Affairs to draft a relevant instruction and submit it
to the Narrow C.P.C. by DecemberÂ 29, 1919.

23/XII.

Comrade Zinoviev,

Your letter of 20/XII received.

About Petrograd, arrange everything with Trotsky. It is
evidently necessary to preserve and restore all defence
installations (I hear they are already stealing barbed wire,
etc.), and to devise a system of weekly mobilisations (
either âalertsâ or musters), in order to keep Petrograd in a
state of preparedness. This must be carefully thought out.

Food supply is at a complete standstill because of
transport. Repairs to locomotives and trucks!!

About shale, it is splendid that you have already
started. But I was surprised at your writing about the
transport of shale. Shale does not stand transport (unless it is
for gas: shale is said to yield more gas than coal does), and
electricity should be laid on locally and a distillation plant
set up on the spot to obtain oil from shale. That is what I
have been told here. And I thought that Petrograd with all
its resources could cope both with the task of electrification
and of distillation.

Greetings,
 Lenin

N.B. Cannot blockhouses be erected for the defence of
Petrograd? I am sending you and Trotsky a report on this
subject.

Why are there not more sleigh-cars? There are said to be
over 100Â tracks?

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a telegram sent from Ruzayevka by J.Â Kh. Peters,
Chairman of the Special Committee for Introducing Martial Law
on the Railways. It was received late in the evening on December
25, 1919, and contained a proposal for recalling skilled workers
of railway repair-shops and depots from the army, since locomotive
repairs had decreased almost everywhere, and in some places
dropped to a catastrophic minimum.

At a meeting of the Council of Defence on December 31, after
discussion of a draft decision put forward by L.Â B. Krasin âon
withdrawing from the army skilled railway repair-shop men and
workersâ, =

it was decided to regard the question as settled, in
view of Krasinâs statement that in practice it had already been
solved.

Comrade Chicherin,

Your proposals have been adopted almost entirely by the
Politbureau.[1] Regarding the exact text, phone the
Secretary of the C.C., Comrade Krestinsky.
Please, never use the expression âChairman of the C.C.â,
       for there is no such post.

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes

This refers to the meeting of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
on DecemberÂ 27, 1919, which discussed the following: an inquiry
by Chicherin whether he could send the Georgian Government a
proposal for joint military operations against Denikin without
recognising that government; a report by Chicherin that the
Estonians agreed to give the military guarantees asked for on

 Â  

condition of their being granted the right t,o construct
fortifications on the left bank of the Narova; a statement by Chicherin
concerning the Petrograd branch of ROSTA, which had published
a communication of a military nature that could be interpreted
by the Entente and Finland as an intention on the part of Soviet
Russia to launch an attack against Finland, and other
questions.

On the previous day, December 29, 1919, Lenin received
Maria Movshovich in his office in the Kremlin. She had come
to Moscow from the front because her husband had fallen ill with
typhus and her daughter was left without anyone to look after
her. Lenin talked to her about her work in the Red Army and the
situation at the front. On the following day he visited her and
promised his help in arranging her personal affairs.

a member of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food,
and received by C.P.C. secretary M.Â I. Glyasser on JanuaryÂ 1,
1920, at 4.25Â p.m. It concerned information which had arrived
on December 30 and 31 about the progress of the loading and
dispatch of food trains to Moscow. Yakovleva reported also the
absence of information from Kazan and Simbirsk, since the direct
line was out of action on both December 30 and 31, and that in
Samara the number of empties provided for food was considerably
less than what was required.

4/1. 1920

Comrade Chicherin,

Please forward to Litvinov (and if possible, transmit
in abridged form by telegraph in code):

I have received from him a small batch of pamphlets and
newspapers and am extremely disappointed. The selection
has been utterly casual and careless. Obviously, no one has
shown the slightest care in such an important matter as
supplying Russia with Western socialist literature.
 

There are no pamphlets and books by the socialist
leaders (although their titles and the names of the authors
can be found in the Austrian, German, French, Italian and
English newspapers).

The newspapers have been so poorly selected that 9/10
of them is rubbish, while, for example, out of a heap of
issues of
Freiheit,[1] the really important issues (even the
most important, perhaps the only important ones) have been
left out, namely, the reports of the Leipzig
Congress[2]
and the text of the resolutions.

Absolute carelessness, negligence or lack of
understanding and unwillingness to understand what is needed.

We must have them (Litvinov and all members of the
R.C.P. abroad and all âbureauxâ and agencies) see to it
that people conversant with the literature are engaged in each
country (to begin with, Denmark, Holland, etc., will
suffice), their duty being to collect 4â5 copies of
 ||| N.B.

every socialist
and anarchist and communist pamphlet and book, every
resolution, all reports and minutes of congresses, etc., etc.,
in all languages. All to be delivered to Copenhagen,
Stockholm, Vienna, etc. (to Berlin as well).
 N.B. |||


Messengers are
availableâinfrequently, but they are available. The literature
must be collected in good time by employed persons (
Russians are slovenly and will never do this meticulously).

It is stupid to grudge money for this.

Ask Litvinov to tell this to
   Abramovich
   Kopp
   Rutgers
   Bronsky
   Lyubarsky
   Reich
   StrÃ¶m
   Z. HÃ¶glund
   Kilbom
   Rothstein, etc.

Have 3â5 and more collectors, otherwise we shall never
get what is absolutely necessary.

Lenin
 

P.S. Please send a copy of this (or this letter itself after
it has been dealt with) to Klinger.

Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, held in Leipzig
between November 30 and DecemberÂ 6, 1919. Under pressure
from Left-wing members of the party, the Congress adopted a
programme of action which supported the idea of the dictatorship
of the proletariat and the system of Soviets. At the Congress, the
proletarian wing of the party proposed âimmediate and

 Â  

unconditional affiliation to the Third Internationalâ. (See present
edition, Vol.Â 31, p.Â 74.)

Comrade Svidersky,

Receive the comrades without fail or ask another member
of the Board to do so, and be sure to inform me of your
decision.

Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
The note to Svidersky was written on a letter to Lenin from the
workers of the Balashinsk factory, who wrote: âWe workers
receive food, exclusively bread, at intervals of 5 to 14Â days, and no
other products. If potatoes are issued from the centre they stand
for about a month on the railway line.... Comrade Lenin, we ask
you to help us improve our position so that we can do better work
for the good and prosperity of our revolutionary Russia.â

Members of the Politbureau

I voted against this decision of the C.P.C., but I
consider it inconvenient to rescind it at once.

I propose, without calling together the Politbureau, to
collect the votes of its members. My proposal: to get an
immediate decision of the C.P.C. that the State Control
is obliged to let the Food Commissariat know about every
such case. In a month or so we shall see.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 5, 1920, Tsyurupa sent a letter to the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
in which he pointed out that the decision adopted by the Council
of Peopleâs Commissars on January 3, 1920, permitting agencies
of the Supreme Economic Council to purchase forage at free prices
in cases where the State Control found it impossible for agencies
of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food to supply forage to S.E.C.
enterprises, violated the principles of the Food Commissariatâs
food policy and did away with the forage procurement monopoly.
He requested that the matter be discussed in the C.C., R.C.P.(B.).

12. I. 1920

R.M.C. of the 3rdÂ Army

I fully approve your proposals. I welcome the initiative.
Am submitting the question to the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars. Start on the job, on condition of the strictest
co-ordination with the civil authorities, and devote all
energies to the collection of all food surpluses and the
restoration of transport.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in reply to a telegram to Lenin from the Revolutionary
Military Council of the 3rd Army on January 10, 1920, which
proposed that the army be switched over to the work of restoring
the national economy. On JanuaryÂ 13, 1920, in its decision on
Leninâs report concerning the organisation of the 1st Labour
Army, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars welcomed the proposal
of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 3rd Army. A
commission consisting of Lenin, Krasin, Rykov, Tomsky, Trotsky and
Tsyurupa was set up to draft proposals for the most expedient
ways of utilising the 3rd Army. By its decree of January 15,
1920, the Council of Defence converted the 3rd Army into the
1st Labour Army and set up a Revolutionary Council of the 1st
Labour Army from among members of the Revolutionary Military
Council, representatives of the Peopleâs Commissariats for Food,
Agriculture, Railways, and Labour, and representatives of the
Supreme Economic Council. On JanuaryÂ 17 and 18, the question
of using military units on the economic front was discussed in
the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.). The Politbureau approved
the decision of the Council of Defence to convert the 3rd Army
into the 1st Labour Army and passed a decision calling for plans to
be drawn up for the creation of Kuban-Grozny, Ukrainian, Kazan,
and Petrograd Labour Armies. On JanuaryÂ 21, 1920, the Council
of Peopleâs Commissars of the R.S.F.S.R. by agreement with the
All-Ukraine Revolutionary Committee passed a decision to form
a Ukrainian Labour Army in the area of the South-Western Front.
On FebruaryÂ 10, the Council of Defence decreed that the 7th
Army was to be renamed the Petrograd Revolutionary Army of
Labour. At the end of January and beginning of February, the
Reserve Army of the Republic and units of the 2nd Army were
drawn into the work of economic construction, the troops of the

 Â  

8thÂ Army in March, and certain other military formations
somewhat later. With the outbreak of the war against
bourgeois-landowner Poland and Wrangel, the labour armies had to be
switched back to battle readiness.

 Revolutionary Military CouncilÂ 5

1) R.M.C. 3 proposes converting the 3rdÂ Army into a
labour army for economic revival of the Urals, Chelyabinsk
and Tobolsk gubernias. I am in full sympathy with this
and shall put it before the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
tomorrow. Please give your opinion.

2) I am deeply concerned about the delay in delivering
here 200Â locomotives with food trains. The most urgent
revolutionary measures must be taken to hasten this. See
to prompt unconditional execution.

The question raised by R.M.C.Â 3 is of the greatest
importance. I am putting it before the C.P.C. on 13.Â I.Â 1920,
and I ask the departments concerned to have their opinions
ready by that date.

I think that on 13.I in the C.P.C. we shouldÂ 

first, approve this in principle,Â 

second, give it the widest publicity for encouragement,Â 

third, endorse the basic principles of its organisation, or,
if this cannot be done at once, elect a workmanlike
commission to draft these principles as a matter of urgency.

 Lenin, Chairman of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars

The position in the Don as regards food organisation is
impossible. The Don food agencies have boon set up on paper, but the
appointed food officials are working in the Tambov and Saratov gubernias,
and not where they should be. The district food agencies, set up in
amateur fashion and not connected with the Don Executive
Committee, are receiving no directives and instructions, and for that reason
are not capable of working, and cannot counteract the army food
agents
who frequently commit outrageous
excesses.

Syrtsov
 Deputy Chairman, Don Executive Committee

Tsyurupa and Sereda:

N.B. || 

Your comments?

Seed is badly needed for
sowing!![1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JanuaryÂ 15, 1920, Tsyurupa communicated Leninâs
instruction to M.Â K. Vladimirov, Chairman of the Special Food
Commission of the Southern Front, and asked him to report on the
state of food work in the Don Region.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a report from P.Â N. Solonko concerning deposits of
coal, pyrites and white sand for chinaware in the vicinity of
Bryansk. âThe area on which coal has been discovered,â Solonko
stated, âis approximately 40Â versts square. With the present
means and productivity of labour, the yield of coal could amount
to about 3,500,000 poods annually, and if production is well
organised... the yield could be more than 10Â million poods.â =

Lenin
wrote on the envelope containing Solonkoâs report: =

âFrom P.Â N.
Solonko on coal in the Maltsev area.â

On January 15, 1920, Lenin received from the Chief Coal
Committee a memo giving information about the coal deposits
near Bryansk. âI am sending you the present information,â wrote
A.Â Lomov. âOne of our best coal geologists has promised to go
to the siteâ (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 403).

been arranged. I order strict adherence to the instructions

been obstructing your work, who instituted the commission
which dismissed Chairman Mikhailov and other coâ

Trotskyâs telegram to Frunze, Commander of the Turkestan Front,
gave directives for the deployment of the 4th Army, which had
been converted into a labour army for the construction of the
Alesandrov-Gai-Emba railway line and the reconstruction of the
Krasny Kut-Alesandrov-Gai line to a broad gauge.

On January 19, Frunze signed an order for the construction
of the Emba railway line by the 4thÂ Army.

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telephone message on JanuaryÂ 18, 1920, Peopleâs Commissar
for Health N.Â A. Semashko reported that the troop train with
B.Â S. Weissbrotâs Sanitary Commission, which was sent to the
Southern Front and the Ukraine to combat typhus, was proceeding
very slowly. âI request,â wrote Semashko, =

â1) an immediate
order for the train to be speeded up, =

2) special supervision over
it, =

3) investigation of the causes of delay and a trial of those to
blame by a revolutionary tribunal.â =

If that is how the question is put, then dictate to your
secretary a protest against the Narrow Council and a draft
decree for the Full Council (that the Narrow Council
should not interfere in local affairs without special reasons
and is always obliged to make inquiries from local Soviets
except in cases of extreme
urgency).[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a note to Lenin, Kamenev protested against the decision of
the Narrow Council of Peopleâs Commissars to close down the
Nikitsky Theatre. Kamenev believed this question came within
the competence of the local, and not the central, authorities, in
this case the Moscow Department of Education. On JanuaryÂ 20,
1920, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars discussed the closure
of the Nikitsky Theatre. It endorsed the decision of the Narrow
Council and instructed it âto call in representatives of the
Moscow Soviet in matters concerning Moscowâ. (Collected Works,
Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 405.)

Yumagulov
 Ufa
 Copies to Eltsin, Ufa
 and to Artyom Sergeyev, Bashkir Revolutionary
Committee, Bashkir Regional Committee, Sterlitamak

In stating in the telegram that âThe All-Russia Central
Executive Committee considers it improbable and quite out
of the question that Artyom, Samoilov and Preobrazhensky
could carry on agitation against the Bashkir Republicâ,
the All-Russia C.E.C. thereby again confirmed the necessity
of their most loyal observance of the Bashkir Constitution.

  Â  

The telegram of the Central Committee sent later to
Comrade Artyom had the same aim. Under these circumstances
I am quite sure that Artyom, Preobrazhensky and
Samoilov will give no real cause for complications. The members
of the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee should act in the
same way. Only from your telegram did I learn that
Comrades Shamigulov, Izmailov and others were deported from
Bashkiria by the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee; the
Central Committee thought they were travelling to Moscow
on their own initiative to make a report, considered it
unnecessary for the five comrades to waste time on the
journey and sent them back to Sterlitamak.

Your attempt to deport old Party comrades from
Bashkiria, the absurd reference to their Bukharinist orientation,
the persistent, though incorrect, application of the epithet
âUkrainiansâ to Preobrazhensky, Artyom and Samoilovâ
give me grounds for doubting your objectivity in this
matter. Therefore I order you immediately to fulfil the
telegram from the All-Russia C.E.C. of 20.I, which is
still unfulfilled as regards cancellation of the conspiracy
report.

On behalf of the Politbureau of the C.C.,
 
Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The words âOn behalf of the Politbureau of the C.C., Leninâ
are in Leninâs handwriting.âEd.
 



[2]
Leninâs telegram was written in connection with the attempt
by Bashkir bourgeois nationalists to carry out a coup dâÃ©tat in
Bashkiria in January 1920. The bourgeois nationalist A.-Z.Â A.
Validov and a group of his followers who, under pressure from the
working people, came over to the side of Soviets in February 1919,
had not changed their views or abandoned their aim to secure
bourgeois autonomy for Bashkiria.

In the summer of 1919 the Validov group set up a â
Provisional Central Bureau of the Communists of Bashkiriaâ headed by
Yumagulov, who was at the same time Chairman of the
Revolutionary Committee organised by the Validov group. Validovâs
âBureauâ tried to assume leadership of the Party organisations
of Bashkiria although it had not been endorsed by the Central
Committee of the R.C.P.(B.). In January 1920, on the proposal
of Validovâs supporter, K.Â M. Rakai, the Bashkir Revolutionary
Committee set up a Foreign Relations Department. When the
Party Regional Committee on January 13, 1920, condemned this
step and resolved to recall Rakai from the posts he held, the
Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Yumagulov, tried to carry
out a coup dâÃ©tat. On the night of JanuaryÂ 15, 1920, by his order
the members of the Party Regional Committee and other
Communists were arrested, and a manifesto was issued accusing them
of conspiring against the Bashkir Republic.

The telegram of the C.E.C. of JanuaryÂ 20, 1920, mentioned
by Lenin, stated: âIn view of the friction between the Bashkir
Revolutionary Committee and the Ufa Gubernia Revolutionary
Committee, and your accusation against Comrade Eltsin of
deviating from the policy of the central government, the C.E.C. by
agreement with the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) sent to Sterlitamak
Comrades Artyom (Sergeyev), Preobrazhensky and Samoilov, who have
no local Ufa interests and are incapable of pursuing a localist,
chauvinist policy. The C.E.C. considers it improbable and quite
out of the question that they could carry on agitation against
the Bashkir Republic. The C.E.C. therefore orders you
immediately, upon Comrade Artyomâs directives, to free all the arrested
members of the Regional Committee and other Communists, to
cancel your report of a conspiracy, and make known to the
population and army units that the arrests were due to a
misunderstanding.â =

(Obrazovaniye Bashkirskoi ASSR. Sbornik dokumentov
i materialov, Ufa, 1959, p.Â 444.)


Shortly afterwards, Validov, Yumagulov and Rakai were
recalled from Bashkiria and expelled from the Party.

R.M.C.Â 5

I approve your proposal in regard to a buffer
state.[2]
Only it is essential to lay down firmly that our

  Â  

representative, or preferably two representatives, at the Political
Centre should be informed of all decisions and have the
right to attend all conferences of the Political Centre.

Secondâserious measures of control should be taken over
the disarming of the
Czechoslovaks.[3]

Thirdâit will be very difficult for us for transport
reasons to move the Czechoslovaks out.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of
Defence[1]


January 21, 1920
 

Notes
 

[1]
The telegram was signed also by L.Â D. Trotsky, Chairman
of the Revolutionary Military Council.âEd.
 



[2]
This refers to the stand taken by the Siberian Revolutionary
Committee and the Revolutionary Military Council of the 5th
Army in the talks which took place on January 19, 1920, with
a delegation from the âPolitical Centreâ, which was formed from
representatives of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks,
Zemstvo members and co-operators at an all-Siberia conference of
Zemstvos and towns held in Irkutsk on NovemberÂ 12, 1919. When,
on January 5, 1920, Irkutsk passed into the hands of the insurgent
workers, soldiers and peasants, the âPolitical Centreâ announced
that it had assumed power in the city. The real organs of power
in Irkutsk, however, were the headquarters of the armed workersâ
and peasantsâ detachments and the Military Revolutionary
Committee, which acted under the leadership of the Irkutsk Committee
of the R.C.P.(B.). The question of doing away with the âPolitical
Centreâ was not raised at once, since it was trusted to some
extent by a section of the population and had the support of
considerable forces of the interventionists in Irkutsk Gubernia and the
Trans-Baikal area. The âPolitical Centreâ aimed at the creation
of a âdemocraticâ bourgeois state in Eastern Siberia. At the talks
with the Siberian Revolutionary Committee, its delegation
proposed that the further advance eastward of the 5th Army should
be halted and that a buffer state should be set up in Eastern
Siberia, but the Siberian Revolutionary Committee insisted on
its own conditions, namely, that the Red Army advance to Baikal
and a buffer state be organised in the Trans-Baikal area.

Meanwhile the balance of forces in Irkutsk underwent a radical
change, one which was not to the advantage of the âPolitical
Centreâ. On JanuaryÂ 21, 1920, all power in Irkutsk passed into
the hands of the Revolutionary Committee.





[3]
This refers to the troops of the Czechoslovak Corps, which in
1918â19 were used by the Entente imperialists and the Russian
whiteguards as a strike force against the Soviets, and now were
retreating under the blows of the Red Army. On JanuaryÂ 19,
1920, the Czechoslovak Corps command announced that it was
ceasing military operations and was ready to enter into
negotiations for a truce with the Soviet army command. Soviet envoys
went to Taishet railway station to present the terms for a truce
but the White Czechoslovak command refused to negotiate. The
truce was not signed until FebruaryÂ 7. See also NoteÂ 72.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a memo from G.Â V. Chicherin, Peopleâs Commissar
for Foreign Affairs, reporting cases of violation of the decision
of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) that all information on matters of foreign
policy should first be submitted to censorship. Specific mention
was made of an interview given by V.Â P. Zatonsky (see Vecherniye
Izvestia No.Â 450, January 26, 1920). Lenin sent the document to
the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) marked: âTo be
returned.â On the same day, P.Â M. Kerzhentsev, the head of ROSTA,
replied to Lenin that measures had been taken for all
correspondence concerning foreign affairs to be sent to the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs for perusal. On the letter Lenin wrote:
âTo be kept in the dossier on ROSTA.â On FebruaryÂ 21, 1920,
in connection with a letter from the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs about the irresponsible statement of a Moscow
journalist speaking on the radio on questions of Soviet foreign
policy, Lenin again wrote to Kerzhentsev: âWhy was this not
sent for censorship? Who is responsible?â (Lenin Miscellany
XXXIV, p.Â 267.)

Comrade V.Â D. Bonch-Bruyevich,

The State Publishers may be offended that I did
not send Krzhizhanovskyâs pamphlet through
them?[2]
Perhaps I broke the rules? I was in a great hurry.

If it is inconvenient for you to settle the matter
otherwise, would you send this note of mine to Comrade Vorovsky
(I ask him to have a paper issued by the State Publishers
ordering the speediest, by Sunday 1.II, publication of
Krzhizhanovskyâs pamphlet at the 17th Print-shop,
formerly Kushnerevâs, and I apologise for having sent the
pamphlet direct to the press because I was in a great hurry).

Perhaps this has already been done? If not, it must be
done. Give me your reply.

Yours,
 Lenin

10. II. 1920

R.M.C. of the Labour Army
 Ekaterinburg

I am putting your inquiries before the Council of Defence.
Trotsky has left to join you. Personally I fear that you are
indulging in project-mongering, and that Bumazhnyâs and
Maximovâs opposition is a play at departmental game.
I advise you not to engage in recriminations but to throw
all forces into the main thing, viz.:
1) the restoration of
railway transport,
2) the collection and delivery of food,
3) the delivery of firewood, timber and barges to
landing-stages. Let me know whether you can carry out this work
harmoniously, energetically and
rapidly.[1]

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In 1920, Y.Â 0. Bumazhny was Secretary of the Urals Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Party; K.Â G. Maximov was
Chairman of the Supreme Economic Councilâs Industrial Bureau in
the Urals and authorised agent of the Council of Labour and
Defence for the restoration of Urals industry. The friction between
the Revolutionary Military Council of the Labour Army and
departmental representatives was mainly over the question of
the terms of reference of the Revolutionary Military Council.
Leninâs telegram was apparently a reply to an inquiry about ways
of settling the questions in dispute between the Revolutionary
Military Council and the departments.

I am still hopeful that after your talks with Tukhachevsky
and the removal of Sokolnikov, things will adjust
themselves without your transference. Therefore, for the time
being, we are not notifying Smilga. Be sure to inform me in good
time and in detail by code or by telephone from Kharkov.
I consider it most important that the troops disengaged
after the capture of Odessa should not be kept on the
Dniester, but moved to the Western Front as a safeguard against
the Poles. Let me know your opinion.

14. II. 1920

Comrades Sereda
    and Tsyurupa
 Copies to the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions
     Commissariat for State Control
     Commissariat for Trade
     Supreme Economic Council

I draw special attention to the very sensible article
âLose No Timeâ by Y.Â Preobrazhensky in Pravda of 11.II.
 

It is essential to adopt his
proposal[1] and immediatelyÂ 

1) draft a decree

a) on the obligatory organisation of urban farming
 (in all towns);

b) on measures of stimulation and development;

c) assignments (as detailed as possible) to be given
in this field for the year 1920, etc.;

2) step up purchases of seed in Denmark and abroad
in general;

3) step up agitation and workersâ control over the
measures in Â§Â 1.

Please send me a brief summary of what is already being
done (if possible one that would be suitable also for the
pressâwe shall publish it in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, if it
is not possible to do so in Pravda or Izvestia).

In this connection, it is necessary to begin an intensified
and more systematic struggle against suburban bag-trading
by drawing urban workers into the business of keeping
an account (detailed) of crops, stocks, surpluses, collection
of food products in suburban districts, and helping their
procurement by the Food Commissariat agencies. I request
the Food Commissariat to let me know what measures
are being taken.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The article proposed that in order to improve food supplies for
the workers, use should be made of suburban land plots for
developing collective market-gardening and livestock breeding, and
for organising auxiliary farms.

All in code

Smilga and Orjonikidze

Am deeply concerned about the state of our troops on
the Caucasian Front, the complete demoralisation among
Budyonnyâs forces, the weakening of all our troops, the
weakness of the general command, the discord between the armies,
the strengthening of the
enemy.[1] It is essential to exert

  Â  

all efforts and put through a number of emergency
measures with revolutionary energy. Telegraph fully in code
what exactly you are undertaking.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the beginning of February 1920 preparations were made for
a new offensive of the Red Army on the Caucasian Front. At the
same time there was a lack of co-ordination between the armies
of the front. The Mounted Army had been weakened in previous
engagements; exhaustion of the troops and shortage of supplies
were acutely felt. Owing to a relaxation of political and
educational work, instances of infringement of military discipline began
to occur in the units.

The Composite Cavalry Corps, which co-operated with the
1stÂ Mounted Army, was seriously affected. Counter-revolutionary
elements were active at Corps Headquarters. On the night of
FebruaryÂ 2, Corps Commissar, V.Â N. Mikeladze, was murdered
by counter-revolutionaries. All these circumstances in
conjunction with the extremely complex military situation caused Lenin
great anxiety, since they jeopardised the Red Armyâs offensive
in the Northern Caucasus, the aim of which was the final defeat
of the enemy.

Trotsky
 Copy to Smirnov, R.M.C. 5
 also in code

I fully support your reply to Smirnov. We must
vehemently denounce the opponents of a buffer
state[1] (it
seems that Frumkin is such an opponent), threaten to bring
them before a Party court, and demand that everyone in
Siberia carry out the slogan: ânot a step farther east,
all-out efforts to hasten the movement of troops and
locomotives to the west, to Russiaâ. We would be idiots to allow
ourselves to be drawn into a stupid movement into the
heart of Siberia, permitting Denikin meanwhile to revive
and the Poles to strike. It would be a crime.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the formation of the Far Eastern Republic
as a buffer state. The F.E.R. was established in April 1920
on the territory of the Trans-Baikal, Amur, Primorye, and
Kamchatka regions and Northern Sakhalin. The formation of
the F.E.R.âa state which, though bourgeois-democratic in form,
carried out a Soviet policyâwas in the interests of Soviet Russia,
which sought to obtain a long respite on the Eastern Front and
to avoid war with Japan.

After the territories of the Far East (with the exception of
Northern Sakhalin) had been cleared of interventionists and
whiteguards, the Peopleâs Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic
on NovemberÂ 14, 1922, passed a decision to unite with the
R.S.F.S.R. On NovemberÂ 15, 1922, the All-Russia C.E.C.
announced the incorporation of the Far Eastern Republic into the
R.S.F.S.R.

Krestinsky and L.Â B. Kamenev

To the members of the Politbureau:

I am against summoning Stalin. He is cavilling. The
Commander-in-Chief is quite right: first of all we must
defeat Denikin, then pass to a state of peace.
 

I suggest replying to Stalin: âThe Politbureau cannot
summon you at present, as it considers that the most
important and urgent task is to achieve final victory over
Denikin, for which you must step up reinforcements to the
Caucasian Front with the utmost energy.â

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Stalin wired Lenin on February 18, 1920, that he disagreed with
the order of the Commander-in-Chief to detach units of the
Ukrainian Labour Army for reinforcing the front and asked to be
summoned to Moscow to clear the matter up. On FebruaryÂ 19, a
telegram in reply signed by Lenin was sent to Stalin worded
according to the text quoted in the present note.

Sapronov is wrong, because before focussing on the
middle peasant it is necessary first, before that, to organise
the poor peasants. This must definitely be done, and best
done not in the form of Poor Peasantsâ Committees, but
in the form of Soviets composed exclusively of poor and
middle peasants, with special measures on our part for
safeguarding the interests of the poor peasants and for
collection of grain. I asked you about transport since
the chief task now is to step up the transport of troops

  Â  

and complete the defeat of Denikin. We must mobilise the
workers for this and at all costs bring up large forces
quickly and win back Rostov. I ask Stalin to reply to me
whether he is taking all measures.

Urgent

Comrade Lenin, Chairman of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 Moscow

Simakov, Chairman of the Bolkhov Uyezd Party Committee, was
married in church to the daughter of a capitalist hostage. At a

  Â  

general meeting of the Communists of the Bolkhov organisation I
proposed that for undermining Party principles Chairman Simakov should
be expelled from the Party. The proposal was adopted and Simakov
was expelled from the Party. Some members of the Party Committee
adhered to their own opinion and called in Comrade Pakun,
representative of the Orel Gubernia Committee. The decision of the meeting
was annulled. For putting forward my proposal I was arrested a few
days later and am now in prison. I ask for your assistance.

Zalygin
 Head of the Uyezd Department
 of Education

The arrested man to be released at once. An explanation
giving reasons for the arrest to be sent by telegraph and
all the case papers to be mailed to the Central Committee.

The Ukhtomsky (Lyubertsy) Works of Moscow Gubernia,
Moscow Uyezd, an agricultural machinery plant, has coal
and materials and the workers (1,300 employees) have not
dispersed. It would be particularly important to support
such a factory.

Please discuss urgently whether the workers of this
factory can be given food assistance as a special measure.
Please telephone your reply to
me.[1]

On the back of Leninâs letter is a memo by A.Â I. Svidersky giving

factory. Over this Lenin wrote: âWe shall verify this tomorrow

Comrades Lobova

    and if they are not in Perm, then to other
    members of the Perm Gubernia Committee of the R.C.P.
  The bearers, Comrades
      Fyodor Samsonovich Sannikov,
      Grigory Ivanovich Mikhalev,
      Platon Pavlovich Moskalyov,
came to me from Kalinin,Â 
 

They are non-Party people, but create an impression of
remarkable conscientiousness.

They are requesting re-registration and checking of the
members of the Uyezd Party Committee (they are from
Perm Gubernia, Usolye Uyezd, Polovodovo Volost) on the
plea that there are many of the worst elements in the local
Party.

Will you please fulfil their request.

Let me know the results of the check-up.

Give me the names of those members of the Uyezd Party
Committee (in Usolye and in the volosts of Usolye Uyezd)
who are personally known to you and are absolutely
reliable.

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Regarding this letter, Yaroslavsky wrote subsequently: âIt was
addressed to three comrades who were then members of the Perm
Gubernia Committee. At that time the situation in Usolye was
rather grave. Shortly before this, a new frontâthe Kai-Cherdyn
Frontâhad been formed there. Remnants of Kolchakâs forces and
northern interventionists had organised bands in Cherdyn, where
they had used the connections of the recently abolished Kolchak
regime and exploited the dissatisfaction caused by the stupid
bungling of some of the local Party officials who had antagonised
the Zyryan people as well. As far as I remember, the Perm
Gubernia Committee, on receiving Leninâs letter, sent a man to
Usolye to ascertain the state of affairs on the spot, after which a
commission was set up which reviewed the composition of the
leading bodies and changed it at a specially convened Party
conference.â =

27. II. 1920

Comrade Vinogradov, Chairman of the Executive
Committee of the Vesyegonsk Teachersâ Union, has presented the
attached
petition.[1]

The crux of the matter is that the Vesyegonsk Uyezd
Food Committee be instructed to issue to the teachers (about
500 in the uyezd) an increased ration of bread and potatoes
plus footwear or leather.

Both from local stocksâthe uyezd has surpluses.

Please make the necessary inquiries today (the comrade
has to leave tomorrow) and give me a reply by telephone
(in the evening we shall decide the matter in the Council
of Defence).

This refers to the âMandate to Comrade Vinogradov, delegate

which dealt with the grave
material plight of the school staffs. On FebruaryÂ 27, 1920,
Vinogradov was received by Lenin. During their talk, which
lasted 45 minutes, Lenin wrote the present letter. A favourable
decision was reached in regard to improving the material position
of the Vesyegonsk teachers.

Comrade Alferov,

Lomonosov, before his departure, had told me that
everything had been done for the oil pipeline.

Clearly we have here sabotage or slovenliness, for your
information is utterly confusing.

Send me without fail not later than 11Â a.m. next Tuesday

ordered and (b) what has been done.

2) The name, patronymic and surname of each

In the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxismâ
Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U. there is a note of Leninâs to Alferov:
âYou promised information about the oil pipeline but did not
give it!â, and a reply from Alferov on the construction of the
Emba oil pipeline marked â27.II.Alferovâ.

The construction of the Emba pipeline was discussed at a
meeting of the Council of Defence on MarchÂ 5, 1920. The Council
decided to instruct the Board of the Supreme Economic
Council to examine the plan for the construction of the Emba
pipeline and submit it to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars in final
form, and to ascertain whether an inquiry had been made abroad
for ordering the pipes required.

[1]
The Free Economic Society was founded in 1765, with the object,
as laid down in its statutes, âof disseminating within the country
information useful for agriculture and industryâ. The society
carried out surveys by questionnaires and expeditions for
studying various branches of the economy and regions of the country.

 Â  

It possessed a large library of some 200,000 volumes. After the
October Revolution the library became part of the
Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library in Leningrad.

Stalin, member of the Revolutionary Military Council of
 the South-Western Front

The Central Committee confirms its decision on the need
to assign responsible political workers from the armies of
the South-Western Front for transport work. The C.C.
considers the transfer of responsible workers from the
armies to the railways to be the most important guarantee
for the salvation of transport. Even the Caucasian Front

  Â  

has provided the whole apparatus of the 2nd Army and 100
political workers for work on the railways of the
South-East. Telegraph the number and duties of those assigned.

George Lansbury, editor of the British newspaper The Daily

21 he was received by Lenin who had a detailed conversation
with him, in particular on the attitude of the Bolsheviks to
religion. On returning to England, Lansbury sent Lenin a letter in
which he wrote: âMany thanks to you and all your colleagues

Comrade Kuzmin, member of R.M.C.Â 6

ReÂ No.Â 95.

Exercise the utmost caution and distrust in this
matter.[1] Mind you are not fooled by officers who want to
infiltrate among us in order to demoralise the army. Make
thorough inquiries about everyone wishing to return and if
you are convinced that his return will be useful, inform
Moscow to obtain permission. Discuss this question with
Lomovâs
commission,[2] which has gone to Archangel.
Report the views expressed in the discussion.

Re No.Â 82.

Chicherinâs statement about leaving the country
stipulated the surrender of the White government, but it
has fled. For the time being, do not permit anyone
to go abroad. Employ the arrested officers on work. Use
those who have remained at liberty for the same purpose.
Sklyanskyâs telegram No.Â 49/III about sending some of them
to the centre holds good. Discuss the question with
Lomovâs commission.

[1]

N.Â N. Kuzmin, a member of the Revolutionary Military Council
of the 6th Army, asked Lenin about the attitude to be adopted
towards whiteguard officers who had laid down their arms and
declared their readiness to work in Soviet Russia.





[2]

5/III.

Comrade Chutskayev,

Especially urgent measures must be adopted to speed up
the sorting of
valuables.[1] If we are too late, they will
give nothing for them in Europe and America.

In Moscow, a thousand Party members, etc., can (and
should) be mobilised for this work under special control.
 

At your end, evidently, the whole business is dragging
woefully.

Write what extraordinary measures you are taking to
speed things up.

Lenin
 

Notes

This refers to valuable antiques, luxury articles and works of
art that had been nationalised. In February 1919, Maxim Gorky
set up a committee of experts in Petrograd to select and value
these articles. Up to OctoberÂ 1, 1920, this committee, consisting
of 80 persons, had selected, as Gorky wrote, â120,000 various
articlesâ (V.Â I. Lenin i A.Â M. Gorky. Pisma, vospominaniya,
dokumenty [V.Â I. Lenin and A.Â M. Gorky. Letters, Recollections,
Documents], 1961, p.Â 164). This work, however, progressed
extremely slowly. On Gorkyâs letter, Lenin wrote: âonly 8stores
out of 33 have been gone throughâ (ibid.).

Trotsky

If grain and timber procurement has risen, special efforts
must be devoted to barges and preparations for floating,
especially barges for oil, then to building houses for the
Chelyabinsk and other coal workers. Cannot the Siberian
prisoners of war and officers be moved to the Urals and
set to work on coal and timber?

To expedite replies from the centre, obtain direct lines
through the military department.

Krestinsky has replied to you. I repeat in brief. The
Ishim remains in Tyumen Gubernia. You can keep
Brunovsky. About meat, an order to organise salting centres has
been given.

Regarding regional centres, it is necessary to tread
warily and think it over carefully, so as to avoid regionalism.

If troop formation in Siberia has been overdone you
should check yourself what real measures are being taken
to combat this, summoning to the direct line anyone you
require.

Smirnov must be taken off diplomatic, frontier and
military affairs and returned to peace-time work.

Lenin

Written in reply to Trotskyâs telegram from Ekaterinburg dated
March 5, 1920, in which he reported a considerable increase in
food procurements in districts of the Urals and Siberia, complained
that the central departments did not even reply to inquiries from
the Siberian and Urals organisations, and asserted that only the
establishment of regional centres with wide powers could put the
work on a proper footing. On the text of the telegram Lenin wrote
his remarks about the decision on Ishim Uyezd and the request
that Brunovsky be kept for food work, and also about meat
procurement in Siberia: =

â1) Remains in Tyumen Gubernia.


â2) No objection to Brunovsky (for the Food Commissariat).

â3) The Food Commissariat has issued an order to organise
salting centres.â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 413.)

The Poles are advancing further, we have evacuated
Rechitsa. Gomel is said to be threatened, therefore, despite
Stalinâs optimism, I consider essential and urgently
necessary all the extraordinary measures you have proposed.
In regard to the Commissariat for Railways, the
Politbureau has decided to propose making you Peopleâs
Commissar for Railways, since Krasin will be going abroad
hi a week, and Lomonosov, after typhus, will have
recovered only in six weeksâ
time.[1] Reply immediately.

On MarchÂ 8, 1920, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
discussed the question of the Peopleâs Commissar for Railways in
view of the fact that Krasin was going abroad. It was decided:
âThat Comrade Lenin be asked to communicate with Comrade
Trotskyâ (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 413). On March
20, the Politbureau adopted a decision to put through the
Presidium of the C.E.C. and the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
Trotskyâs appointment as Acting Peopleâs Commissar for Railways.

organise for today a meeting of representatives of the

Food Commissariat
 Commissariat for Agriculture
 Commissariat for Railways
 Chief Board of Water Transport
 Central Committee of Textile Industry
 Commissariat for Labour.

Comrade Kiselyov, member of the Presidium of the
C.E.C., has agreed to convene the commission.

The commissionâs terms of reference: to discuss the
proposals of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Party Committee
dated 6/111 and to work out emergency relief measures.
Report on fulfilment to be given to the C.P.C. by Saturday.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)

Notes
 
 



[1]
On March 10, 1920, Lenin received V.Â S. Smirnov (Malkov)
and M.Â Z. Manuilsky, representatives of Ivanovo-Voznesensk
Gubernia, and A.Â S. Kiselyov, a member of the C.E.C. (in the past
a leading member of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Party organisation).
In accordance with a decision of the Gubernia Party Committee
of March 6, they asked Lenin to increase the supply of food to
Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, to remove the intercepting
detachments in Yuriev-Polsky Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia, to include
it in Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia and to provide
Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia at first open water with ships and barges
for transporting foodstuffs, seed, etc. On the same day the
Council of Defence discussed a report by A.Â B. Khalatov, a member
of the Board of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, concerning
the supply of food for Ivanovo-Voznesensk workers, and the
question of joining Yuriev-Polsky Uyezd to Ivanovo-Voznesensk
Gubernia. The Council of Defence resolved: âThat the Chief Board
of Water Transport be instructed to take urgent measures to supply
the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Food Committee with tonnage
to the amount of 400,000 poods for urgent delivery of seed potatoes
from the Simbirsk, Kazan and Yaroslavl gubernias.â =

Rakovsky, Ukrainian Council of Peopleâs Commissars,
 for Blakitny, Presidium of the All-Ukraine Conference
 of Borotbists
 Kharkov

I thank you for the greetings from the bottom of my heart.
Warmest wishes for the success of the conference,
particularly for the success of the work that has been begun for
merging with the Party of Bolsheviks.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Ukrainian petty-bourgeois nationalist Borotba Party arose in
May 1918 after the split in the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary
Party. It got its name from the central organ of the partyâthe
newspaper Borotba (Struggle). The Borotbists twice applied to
the Executive Committee of the Communist International to be
allowed to affiliate to the Communist International. On FebruaryÂ 
26, 1920, the Communist International by a special decision
called on the Borotbists to dissolve their party and merge with
the C.P.(B.) of the Ukraine.

Owing to the growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the
mass of the peasants and the successes of Soviet power in the
Ukraine, the Borotbists at their conference in the middle of March
1920 were compelled to pass a decision to dissolve their party.
A decision to admit the Borotbists to membership of the
Ukrainian C.P.(B.) was adopted at the Fourth All-Ukraine Conference
of the C.P.(B.)U., which took place from MarchÂ 17 to 23, 1920.

Why should you not submit a separate decree for calling

At its meeting on March 16, 1920, the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars discussed the draft of a decree presented by L.Â B. Krasin
enabling orders to be placed abroad for locomotives and spare

in gold were earmarked for this purpose. Leninâs note was

You are making a mistake in âgoing outâ for âsomething
bigâ and overlooking the small. Go after the little bird.
There are small firms outside the trusts. These firms can
make (sometimes sell) spare parts and the like.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this note on Krasinâs letter concerning the purchase
of locomotives from American trusts. Krasin wrote that there
were only three trusts in the U.S.A. from which locomotives
could be obtained. It was intended to start an immediate
correspondence with them by radio from Scandinavia or London.
Krasin, however, expressed the fear that as a result of this publicity
a âhostâ of middlemen would spring up between him and these
trusts as the main suppliers, and that this would not only send
the price up but also delay delivery.

There is something we failed to do as regards locomotive
repairs.

What about a commission of Central Committee men to
hustle things and check up?

Or reports once a week?

Or something else?

Who is keeping an eye on this? Who is pushing things?
No one.

Who has selected the best repair-shops? What results
are there from the 200-pood bonus per locomotive?

What about putting Rozengolts personally in charge of
this, perhaps plus someone else?

Weâve passed a decree and gone to
sleep....[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin urged the need for intensified and uninterrupted work on
locomotive repairs in view of the catastrophic state of railway
transport, and this problem was repeatedly discussed by the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars and the Council of Defence. Thus,
on FebruaryÂ 5, 1920, the C.P.C. heard a report by Krasin on
special privileges for workers engaged in locomotive repairs and
the production of spare parts for transport. On FebruaryÂ 27, the
Council of Defence discussed non-fulfilment by the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Food of the decree granting bonuses to workers who
repaired trains in their spare time. On MarchÂ 16, following a

 Â  

report by G.Â N. Melnichansky (Chairman of the Moscow Gubernia
Council of Trade Unions), the C.P.C. adopted a decision to
organise locomotive repair in the best workshops, where work would
be carried on in three shifts round the clock. At the same meeting
the Council discussed a number of other measures for improving
the state of the railway transport.

Gorky
 Petrograd

In reply to your letter of 5/III, I quote the text of the
telegram which the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food sent
to Badayev: âPending final settlement by a special
commission of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars of the
question of improving the position of scientists, you are
instructed to continue supplies according to the plan previously
adopted by you, i.e., without making a reduction in
keeping with recent orders of the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Food.â
Pokrovskyâs commission is appealing against the
Petrograd list as being unfair. Sapozhnikov was released
on 9/III. Manukhin has to present to Semashko, Peopleâs
Commissar for Health, a description of the method of the
proposed research, on the results of the examination of
which the decision depends.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter dated March 5,1920, Maxim Gorky asked Lenin to keep
the 1,800 rations for Petrograd scientists intact, to release
from prison as soon as possible the well-known chemist
A.Â V. Sapozhnikov, and to enable the physician I.Â I. Manukhin
to carry out research on a vaccine against typhus (see V.Â I. Lenin
i A.Â M. Gorky. Pisma, vospominaniya, dokumenty, Moscow, 1961,
pp. 146â47).

Comrade Goldberg
 Revolutionary Military Council of the Reserve Army

The Council of Workersâ and Peasantsâ Defence sends
comradely thanks on behalf of Soviet power to all the
workers, Red Army men, technical and administrative
personnel, who worked to restore the bridge over the Kama at
Sarapul, finishing it one month ahead of the scheduled time,
thereby giving fresh proof of what the proletariat can
achieve by organisation, energy and labour discipline, given
a class-conscious attitude, so essential at the present time,

  Â  

towards the common tasks confronting the Russian Soviet
Republic in its efforts to cope with the economic
dislocation.

Comrade Radek,

Your opinion? Return this with a line or two. Do you
know exactly the position of K.Â Liebknechtâs family? Is
assistance needed and to what extent?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note to Radek was written in connection with a report that
Karl Liebknechtâs wife was in an extremely agitated state, one
reason for which was that relatives of hers, engineers living in
Rostov, had been transferred to Berlin, about which she had
written to Lunacharsky.

Comrade Stalin
 Copy to Comrade Rakovsky

In view of the fact that 13Â delegates from each trend
were elected at the congress, that 105Â delegates took no
part in the elections to the Central Committee and 8Â 
abstained, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P. has
resolved, as a way out of the abnormal situation, to set up
a temporary bureau of two representatives each from the
old C.C. and the new. Comrade Shumsky, a former
Borotbist, to be appointed the fifth member of the
bureau.[1]

On behalf of the Politbureau,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the elections to the C.C., C.P.(B.) of the Ukraine
at the Fourth Conference of the C.P.(B.)U. held in Kharkov from
MarchÂ 17 to 23, 1920.

The work of the conference was marked by a bitter struggle
of the Leninists against an oppositional group of Democratic
Centralists headed by T.Â Sapronov, V.Â Boguslavsky, Y.Â 
Drobnis, M.Â Farbman (Rafail) and others. During the elections to
the Central Committee of the C.P.(B.)U. the Democratic
Centralists succeeded by factional devices (voting by lists, etc.) in
getting a majority of their supporters into the Central Committee
and in sending their delegates to the Ninth Congress of the
R.C.P.(B.).

105Â conference delegates who upheld the Leninist line refused
to take part in the elections to the C.C. of the C.P.(B.)U. and
denounced them as non-valid. Since the Central Committee elected
by the conference did not reflect the will of the majority of the
Ukrainian Communists, the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) decided it should
be dissolved and replaced by a provisional C.C. of the C.P.(B.)U.
consisting of V.Â P. Zatonsky, F.Â Y. Ron, S.Â V. Kosior, D.Â Z.
Manuilsky, G.Â I. Petrovsky, F.Â A. Sergeyev (Artyom), V.Â Y.
Chubar, and others. In order to explain the measures taken to suppress
the factional activity of the Democratic Centralists in the Ukraine,
the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on AprilÂ 16, 1920, published an open letter
addressed to all Party organisations in the Ukraine. This letter
was approved by all the Party organisations of the Republic.
To strengthen the Ukrainian Party organisations, the C.C.,
R.C.P.(B.) put a large group of experienced Party workers at
the disposal of the C.C., C.P.(B.)U. In May 1920 alone, 674Â 
Communists were sent to the Ukraine. By a decision of the C.C.,
R.C.P.(B.) of AprilÂ 5, 1920, a re-registration of members of the
Communist Party of the Ukraine was carried out.

In confirmation of the telephone message which Lenin
sent to Rakovsky last night, we inform you that, in view
of the anomalous situation created by the fact that 105
delegates refused (while 8 abstained) to take part in the
elections to the C.C. and protested against these
elections as being unlawful, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.
has resolved to set up a temporary body pending the
settlement of this conflict. This temporary Central Committee
should include Shumsky, a former Borotbist, now a Party
member, who took no part in the factional struggle at the
Ukrainian conference, along with 2Â members of the new
C.C. and 2Â members of the old.

On behalf of the Politbureau,

To the Members of the Politbureau:

I propose sending a code telegram to Eliava and
Rudzutak:

âWe insist on the strictest fulfilment of the C.C.
decisions on foreign policy. Remove Heller and Broido from
office immediately and completely. Hand over all affairs
to Golub, Mashitsky and Gopner alone. Fulfil
immediately all the other directives of the C.C. and report precise
fulfilment. We warn you that further procrastination or
evasion on your part from subordination to the Central
Committee of the Party will entail penalties.â

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin following the systematic violations by the
Turkestan Commission of the decision of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
prescribing that relations with Bukhara, Khiva, Persia and
Afghanistan were to be controlled by the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs. By its decision of SeptemberÂ 29, 1919, the
Orgbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) had charged the Turkestan
Commission with the conduct of foreign relations in accordance with
the instructions and under the control of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. The Turkestan Commission, however,
did not carry out the instructions of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs. The latter demanded that G.Â I. Broido
should be removed from leadership of the Department of Foreign
Relations and that a department be set up consisting of A.Â N.
Golub, A.Â A. Mashitsky, D.Â Y. Gopner and a representative of the
Turkestan Central Executive Committee endorsed by the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, but the Turkestan Commission
refused to comply and appointed Heller head of the Department
of Foreign Relations.

By a decision of the Politbureau of the Central Committee
of the R.C.P.(B.) on MarchÂ 17, 1920, foreign policy functions
were taken out of the hands of the Turkestan Commission, and
the Department of Foreign Relations was made directly
subordinate to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. But
the Turkestan Commission objected to this. Golub, Mashitsky
and Gopner were removed from office and forbidden to
communicate with the Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. The
inquiries of the Commissariat went unanswered.

The last sentence in the manuscript was deleted and left out
in the telegram.

Notes

Written on a letter from V.Â V. Kosior, Chairman of the All-Ukraine
Council of Trade Unions, who reported on the difficulties of
work in the Donets Basin and big industrial centres of the south
(Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav, Taganrog, etc.) due to lack of
personnel. To strengthen the work he proposed that some of the leading
workers of Petrograd and Moscow should be transferred to the
Donets Basin for restoring mines, pits, and metallurgical and
processing factories.

Comrade Rykov

The seizure of 15Â million poods of petrol in
Grozny[1]
compels us to adopt a number of urgent and important
measures, such as:Â 
 

1. Especially strict safeguarding of petrol.
    Military measures. Special responsibility of army men.

2. Calculation: how much we need (maximum).
    The remainderâabroad for locomotives.

3. Collection of lorries (from everywhere, particularly
from the army) and their repair for transporting grain
to the railway stations.

4. Mobilisation of lorries and drivers for this purpose.

5. Transport of petrol to central depots.

Perhaps you will call a conference (of people from the
Commissariat for Food and the military department) on this
question and submit a proposal from the conference to the
Council of Defence?

Please do this urgently.

Comrade Krestinsky,

It is necessary to keep to the law.

By law the final decision is the decision of the 
Orgbureau, which has already rejected the protest of the
Ukrainian Central Committee.

This decision of the Orgbureau Yakovlev (and the
Ukrainian C.C.) is obliged to fulfil at
once.[1]

I agree to an opinion poll without recognising the right
of the poll to hold up the decision, for only the plenum
has that right, and I demand the right of agitation.

Lenin

Chicherin is ill. He is not looked after. He refuses
treatment and is killing himself.

A friendly letter (so as not to hurt his feelings) should
be sent to him in the name of the Central Committee with
the latterâs decision that the C.C. demands that state
property should not be squandered, that the best doctor should
be called in (through Karakhan, say) and should be obeyed,
and that, if the doctor advises, he must go on leave and
spend the necessary time in a sanatorium.

Comrade Tsyurupa,

It was stated in the Politbureau that army transports
from Siberia should be replaced by food transports (in view
of the victories in the south).

The decision was not put in writing because Trotsky,
who was in full agreement, had already issued orders.

The member of the Supreme Council for Transport from
the Commissariat for Food should keep his eyes open.

Yours,
 Lenin

In Kazan (working at the University, lecturer or
professor, etc.) there is
 Adoratsky.

I have known him for more than 10Â years. A most
reliable man. A well-educated Marxist.

I have asked him to write an outline of the history of
the revolution.

PleaseÂ 

1) make full use of him for lectures, etc.

2) assist him with rations (increased), both him and his
family, and with firewood, etc.

3) wire me his address (and what has been done for him).

Comrade Dzerzhinsky,

Give instructions, please, for a very strict check-up.
Cannot impartial people, not Petrograders, be appointed
for the check-up?

I have heard also from another source (besides the
present letters+Kalmykova) that in this case the local Cheka
behaved scandalously.

The matter must be sifted to the bottom, and quickly.

Be so kind, when the case is finished, to return to me
the enclosed documents and have your secretary send me
a telephone message about the
result.[1]

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Petrograd. In 1918, the former owners of a publishing house and
print-shop, in order to prevent them from being nationalised,
organised a bogus co-operative which obtained orders from
various institutions by fraudulent means. The matter was
investigated by the Extraordinary Commission in accordance with
Leninâs directive. The bogus co-operative was abolished. The
print-shop was turned over to the Petrograd Economic Council,
and the publishing house to the Petrograd Branch of State
Publishers.

Comrade V.Â I. Lenin, Chairman of the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars

You forwarded me a telegram from Kazan complaining about the
lack of currency notes. I have received similar telegrams from Vyatka
and Vologda gubernias. In all these places, because of the lack of
money, teachers have not received salaries for three months.

Thus,
it turns out that in the absolutely starving gubernias
teachers go hungry for lack of foodstuffs, while in the producing
gubernias such as those of Kazan, Vologda and Vyatka, in which teachers
in fact could feed themselves, they
are starving through lack of money.

I earnestly request you, Vladimir Ilyich,
to issue some sort of
directive or to put this before the Council of Peopleâs Commissars, so
that currency notes issued for the needs of the gubernias will be
divided
proportionately, i.e.: where there is a 10â20% shortage, this
shortage should be spread among all the departments. Otherwise,

what happens in practice is that absolutely all, except those engaged
in education, receive their salaries....

To the Narrow Council: please put this through. Even
more: it is necessary to give preference to teachers.

Lenin

In confirmation of Comrade Vladimirskyâs telegram, the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars instructs all local
institutions of the Cis-Urals to be extremely moderate and
cautious as regards the new administrative division of the

  Â  

gubernias. The Council of Labour ArmyÂ 1 should also be

At its sitting on 20/IV. 20, the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars decided: to reprimand the Council of Labour ArmyÂ 
1 for its insufficiently serious attitude towards the question
of the new division of the gubernias, and to demand in
future more thorough preparation of the matter so that
there can be no contradictory reports from the localities.

Council of the 1st Labour Army asked that boundary changes
should be stopped and that it be allowed to draft maps of the
Urals and Cis-Urals gubernias and uyezds. On Leninâs motion
this question was discussed by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
on April 20, 1920. In accordance with its decision, the present
telegram was sent to the Council of the 1st Labour Army.

The same meeting discussed a âProtest of the 1stÂ Labour
Army Concerning the New Division of the Tyumen and
Chelyabinsk Guberniasâ. =

The C.P.C. adopted the decision quoted in the
second telegram.

This note was written on a letter from Professor S.Â P. Kostychev
to Maxim Gorky about the work of the Plant Physiology
Laboratory of Petrograd University, which was of great scientific
and practical interest. The letter gave a list of the most essential
articles and materials, the lack of which was greatly impeding
the work of the laboratory. On AprilÂ 22, 1920, Gorky gave this
letter to Lenin and asked him to arrange for Professor Kostychev
to be supplied with the necessary materials.

At the bottom of Leninâs note the Peopleâs Commissar for
Health added the words: âI fully agree with Comrade Leninâs
proposal and for my part ask that Comrade Gorky be given every
assistance N Semashkoâ

by the Poles is partly due to our laxity in this respect. We are past
masters at proving by statistics in our newspapers the inevitability
of our own demise for all kinds of reasons.

To Rykov: I think this is true. Your
opinion?[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his reply to Lenin, Rykov wrote that on the following day
he would order the newspaper Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn to stop
printing news about the loading and transportation of fuel,
leaving only news of procurements.

Comrade Chicherin

Comrade Chicherin,

I would ask you and Fineberg (or if you are too busy,
then a comrade at your choice who has an excellent
knowledge of the British socialist movement) to look through
my pamphlet, or the chapter on
Britain,[1]

and advise me
whether I have made any mistakes or errors of tact. If it
is no trouble I would particularly ask that the actual
corrections be written down separately in pencil.

Yours,
 Lenin

If Comrade Semashko is absent, then for Comrade

Comrade Semashko,

Please receive the bearer, Comrade Dmitry Nikitich
Yeroshenkov, a doctorâs assistant. He has been recommended
to me by a very reliable comrade. Comrade Yeroshenkov has
a few weeks to spare (until the special assignment we are
giving him) and during that time would like, on the one
hand, to study up on medicine and, on the other, to carry
out medical work. Will you please help him.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. The comrade has invented a very practical
disinfecting chamber. It should be tested and used.

 Copy to Rakovsky

Regarding Vinnichenko we agree in principle. Reach
agreement with Rakovsky on
details.[2] Report briefly on
the military situation and prospects.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Transmitted by direct line.âEd.
 



[2]
In the manuscript of the telegram, the word âdetailsâ has been
crossed out and the words âthe form of Vinnichenkoâs coâ
operation in government activitiesâ have been written in an unknown
hand.


In the spring of 1920, V.Â K. Vinnichenko, who was then
living as an emigrant in Vienna, declared that he was breaking
his connections with the Ukrainian Mensheviks and accepting the
platform of the Ukrainian Communist Party. Vinnichenko
requested the Government of the R.S.F.S.R. to allow him to come
to the Ukraine and to give him an opportunity of actively
participating in the struggle against the White Poles and Wrangel, as
well as in building the Soviet Ukraine.

In view of the fact that Vinnichenko and other nationalist
leaders had the backing of a considerable number of Ukrainian
Ã©migrÃ©s, and in order to win away from them elements belonging
to the working people who had been misled, it was decided to
draw Vinnichenko into Soviet work. The question was discussed
several times in the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) and the C.C., C.P.(B.)U.

On September 6, 1920, by a decision of the Politbureau of
the C.C., C.P.(B.)U. Vinnichenko was admitted to membership
of the Ukrainian Communist Party and appointed Deputy
Chairman of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars and Peopleâs
Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Ukrainian S.S.R. On the same
day the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) passed the following
decision regarding Vinnichenko: âThe Politbureau takes note of
Comrade Vinnichenkoâs variable moods and therefore, while not
objecting to his immediate admission into the Party, the
Political Bureau proposes that he should not be given any post, and
should first be tested in practical work.â =

(Collected Works, Fifth
Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 424.)

In October 1920 Vinnichenko again emigrated abroad.

Comrade Trotsky,

I think Chicherin is right: we should reply at once
agreeing
1) to the suspension of hostilities
(a) in the Crimea and
(b) in the Caucasus (every word must be carefully
considered) and
2) to negotiations on the conditions for
clearing the Crimea on the principle (not more) of a general
amnesty for the Whites and
3) to participation of a British
officer in the negotiations with Wrangel. The text of
Chicherinâs reply to be discussed in the Politbureau today,
so that a reply can be sent tonight.

Lenin

We shall collect votes by telephone.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note to Trotsky was written on Chicherinâs letter to Lenin
dated MayÂ 4, 1920, informing him about Lord Curzonâs radio
message. The message suggested a general amnesty and a
conciliatory attitude to the defeated whiteguards and spoke of a
cessation of military operations in the Crimea and the Caucasus.
In Chicherinâs opinion, the proposal for direct talks with Wrangel
with the participation of a British officer would be found
distasteful by every real whiteguard and was a step towards practical
recognition of Soviet Russia by Great Britain. Chicherin
proposed âagreeing to an amnesty for Wrangel and to halting further
penetration into the Caucasus, where we have already captured
everything of importance, and we can reply by giving our consent
without a momentâs delayâ.

I propose a directive that all articles about Poland and
the Polish war be vetted by editors-in-chief on their 
personal responsibility. We must not overdo it, i.e., not
descend to chauvinism, always draw a line between the Polish
landowners and capitalists and the Polish workers and
peasants.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on Y.Â A. Preobrazhenskyâs letter to Lenin suggesting
that âa stop be put to the disgusting âpatriotismââ, and
mentioning a speech of Radekâs âabout a ânationalâ warâ and a chauvinist
article by Bergman in Agitrosta. Preobrazhensky asked to
be allowed to give appropriate directives to the editors of
newspapers, especially provincial ones. To Preobrazhenskyâs request,
Lenin answered: =

âI am wholly in favourâ, and he proposed the
directive reproduced here.

Add to the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets (in
communicating todayâs decision on market
gardens)[2] that we are also
expecting them to adopt measures for taking stock of and
confiscating surpluses from the suburban market
gardeners.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The document bears a note by Fotieva: âIn the minutes or
only in the telephone message?â in which V.Â I. Lenin underlined three
times the words âonly in the telephone messageâ.âEd.
 



[2]
Lenin is referring to the decision of the C.P.C. of MayÂ 27, 1920,
on food resources, directing the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets
âto give special attention to the need to increase the amount of
market-garden products obtained from the environs of the
capitals this year and to submit to the C.P.C. within a fortnight their
proposals for possible measuresâ. =

Notes
 
 



[1]
The telegram from the R.M.C. of the Caucasian Front (received
by the R.M.C. of the Republic on MayÂ 27, 1920) raised the
question of releasing captive Cossacksâprivates and NCOâs of the
Kuban White armyâfrom P.O.W. camps and sending them
home; the officers, it was proposed, were to be put at the disposal
of Front Headquarters.

Comrade Chicherin,

Be sure to take advantage of Comrade Stalinâs presence
in Moscow (for 2 or 3Â days) to have a talk personally with
him and to collect (at once and after his journey, that is,
to have more sent from the front) all material concerning
British help for Wrangel.

Carefully collect it all and publish it within a week or
two with a calm (without any abuse) Note of protest,
showing that Britain deviated from the
truth.[1]

Greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. I have sent Bukharin (for you, too) my letter to the
British workers. Ring up Bukharin.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JuneÂ 11, 1920, G.Â V. Chicherin, Peopleâs Commissar for
Foreign Affairs, sent a Soviet Government Note to the British
Government addressed to the Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon,
containing facts about the aid given by the British Government
to the whiteguard General Wrangel. The Note stated that
Wrangel himself, in an army order issued on MayÂ 6, âopenly and
explicitly mentions the diplomatic intervention of Great Britain on
his behalf as a means of keeping his hold on the Crimea and
mounting a new attack against Soviet Russiaâ. =

This Note was published
on June 13, 1920, in Izvestia No.Â 127. On this subject, see also
Leninâs letter to Chicherin of JuneÂ 11, 1920 (see this volume,
DocumentÂ 609).

Chairman, Gubernia Executive Committee
 Nizhni

According to information received, by a decision of the
Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia Executive Committee there was
no loading of grain freights on Sunday, MayÂ 30. Bearing
in mind that supplies for the Western Front, Petrograd and
Moscow are almost exclusively water-borne, a stoppage in
loading, even if only for one day, is impermissible and
criminal. Take measures to prevent any repetition of such
facts in future, and urgently report execution to me.

Comrade Stalin
 Kremenchug
To be handed only personally to Stalin for personal
   decoding

The situation on the Western Front has turned out to
be worse than Tukhachevsky and the Commander-in-Chief
thought, hence the divisions you asked for must be sent
there, but no more can be taken from the Caucasian Front,
because there are insurrections there and the position is
extremely alarming. Trotsky is arranging to send you
reinforcements from the Crimean divisions, which may enable

  Â  

you to take two or three of them for the Kiev direction.
Try to bring up the units and at all costs follow up the
offensive with greater vigour. You, of course, will
remember that, by a decision of the Politbureau, the offensive
against the Crimea has been halted pending a further
decision of the
Politbureau.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the decision of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
of MayÂ 4, 1920, suspending military operations in the Crimea and
the Caucasus. See also this volume, DocumentÂ 583.

Council of Peopleâs Commissars (the Narrow Council of Peopleâs
Commissars)â =

endorsed by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on
JuneÂ 1, 1920. Leninâs addendum relates to the first four points
of the âStatuteâ, which state that âthe purpose of the Narrow
Council of Peopleâs Commissars is to work up questions which
have to be dealt with by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars and

Written on a telegram to Lenin dated JuneÂ 1, 1920, from Z.Â N.
Dosser, Chairman of the Chief Oil Committee, and A.Â P. Serebrovsky,
Chairman of the Azerbaijan Oil Committee. The telegram reported
the grave food situation among the workers of the Baku oil industry
owing to the fact that A.Â Y. Belenky, Special Food Commissar,
failed to fulfil obligations in regard to the dispatch of food from
the Northern Caucasus to Baku, while at the same time refusing
to allow the oil workers to make their own food procurements in
the Northern Caucasus.

will be sacrificing a host of our soldiers. We must think
this over and weigh it up ten times. I suggest replying to

Krestinsky. Urgent.

(Enclose the Siberian telegram on the census and Popovâs
comment.)

I suggest collecting the votes of the Politbureau members
today, by telephone, for a decision such as the following:



the census in Siberia to be definitely carried out
simultaneously with Russia; moreover, in place of the
dubious local people suspected of supporting the
Kolchak regime, workers to be called in from the
famine-stricken gubernias of Russia.




If they do not agree, the Politbureau is to be called
tomorrow, 5.VI, in the morning. Less than 1,000 workers
are needed. They can easily be transported and will be of
great use.

Comrade Trotsky,

The Commander-in-Chief must be informed and asked
for his opinion. When you have received it, give me your
conclusion at the meeting of the Council of Defence, or let
us talk it over (if it does not end too late) by telephone,

Lenin

There is some capriciousness here, I dare say. But the
matter needs to be discussed urgently. And what
extraordinary measures should be taken?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on Stalinâs telegram from Kremenchug dated June 4,
1920, and apparently received by Lenin during a sitting of the
Council of Labour and Defence. The telegram reported General
Wrangelâs intention to attack with one group of troops in the
Alyoshki-Kherson area, and to land another group in the Odessa
area so as to envelop it from two sides.

On receiving Trotskyâs note saying that Stalin had violated
the established rules by addressing himself directly to Lenin
(since such information should have been sent to the
Commander-in-Chief by A.Â I. Yegorov, commander of the forces on the
Southwestern Front), Lenin sent the second note to Trotsky.

He is a member of the Supreme Board, lives oil the Soviet ration,
works unlimited hours. Alferov.

He must be given a higher ration, one way or another.

Such a situation canât be tolerated. An exception must
be made.

4/VI. 1920

Comrade Botin,

You told Comrade Belenky that the experiments could
be made on Friday (i.e.,
today).[1] A special militaryâ
political circumstance has arisen, which may mean our losing
many extra thousands of Red Army men within the next few
days. It is therefore my absolute duty to request insistently
that you hasten the experiment and carry it out today
without fail, if there is the slightest possibility (all the manual
work, such as regulating the engine, you should assign
to others, not occupying yourself with trifles).

Will you please answer me at once by the messenger,
as fully and exactly as possible. I would not be hurrying
you if an immediate political-strategic decision of great
importance were not called for.

Answer in detailÂ 

(1) Can you speed things up to the maximum extent?

(2) When will you carry out the first experiment and
when (approximately) will you complete it?

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the experiments of S.Â I. Botin, who was
working on the problem of induced detonation by electromagnetic
waves. In October 1921 a commission of experts recommended
that the experiments should be discontinued owing to their
insufficient preparation.

5/VI. 1920

Dear Vladimir Alexandrovich,

I have just heard from Maria Ilyinichna of the death
of your son. We were both stunned by the news! Heart
disease, I take it. On behalf of myself, of Nadezhda
Konstantinovna, and of Maria Ilyinichna, permit me to press your
hand hard and that of your wife, whose acquaintance,

  Â  

unfortunately, I have not had a chance to make. You need
all your strength to help you both bear this blow, worn
out as you are by overwork. And bear it you must, for we
have so few functionaries. Again, a very firm handshake!

Wholly yours,
 Lenin

This is blatant lying and trickery designed for fools.

They have given arms, they are giving coal and a fleetâ
and they make this statement through âWiseâ (=Bullitt?).

I advise:
1) Send a coded message to Krasin: âthat
scoundrel Lloyd George is fooling you in the most vile and
shameless manner, donât believe a word, and fool him
threefoldâ.

2) To Curzon: a derisive telegram (of course, when you
had already given arms, he, not you, started an offensive,
and when you had given coal, he, not you, set the ships
in motion, and so on in that strain).

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a telegram to Chicherin from Krasin, Chairman of
the Russian Trade Delegation in London, who reported that on
June 10, 1920, he had had a visit from Wise, who stated officially,
on behalf of Lloyd George, that the offensive begun by Wrangel
was undertaken against the wishes of the British Government.

The Soviet Governmentâs Note in reply to the British
Government, which was worded according to Leninâs directive and sent
by radio on JuneÂ 11, stated: âTrue, at the present time it is
Wrangel with his whiteguards, and not a British general, who is
attacking Russia anew, but the weapons and ammunition which he
uses were supplied to him by the British Government and other
Allied Governments; his strategic movements have taken place
under the protection of British and other Allied vessels, he has
received the coal he needed from Great Britain, and the Allied
fleet partly helped him in his landing operations and partly
directly participated in them. The Russian Government, therefore,
cannot share the point of view of the British Government that
the latter bears no responsibility for this new attack on Soviet
Russia.â =

16. VI. 1920

Dear Comrades,

I enclose herewith the decision of the Council of Labour
and Defence of
11.VI,[1] and again specially ask you to
give this question the most serious attention.

The Moscow population can and should be mobilised to
a man to haul out of the forests by hand a sufficient
quantity of firewood (say, one cubic metro per adult man in
3 monthsâthe experts can figure it out more exactly; I
mention a figure as an example) to stations on the railways
and narrow-gauge lines.

Unless heroic measures are taken, I shall personally get
a decision put through the Council of Defence and the C.C.
not only for the arrest of all the persons responsible but
for their execution. Inactivity and negligence cannot be
tolerated.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On JuneÂ 11, 1920, after hearing the report of a commission on
measures for ensuring the maximum deliveries of fuel, especially
for Moscow, the Council of Labour and Defence resolved: âTo make
the Moscow Fuel Board and the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Railways responsible for transporting within three weeks all the
firewood lying at railway stations within a 30âverst radius of
Moscow, to the amount of about 8,000 cubic sazhens.â =

18. VI. 1920

Comrade Heller,

I am sending you all the materials (in my possession).

Make up an accurate list of them at once.

I shall obtain Avanti! and send it.

Make a list of the most important documents and a
translation of those that are extremely important, showing the
deviation of the reformists (especially Turati and Co.) from
the discipline and decisions.

(As applying to Serrati, Comunismo No.Â 10, 15â29.II.1920,
p.Â 693:
 


âSimile opera di epurazioneâdi âpurificazioneâ ha scritto
Francesco Misiano nello stesso âSovietââpuÃ² essere veramente opportuna ed
utile, sopratutto se si tratti di chi risolutamente si opponga alla
propaganda per la realizzazione dei princip&iwhatthe fissati a
Bologna[3] come
met a del nostrÃ³
movimento.â[1]

)




X || 

This is the thing
 to find out, by name and exactly.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Serrati, Comunismo No.Â 10, 15â29.II.1920, p.Â 693:
âSuch work
of cleansingâof âpurificationââwrote Francesco Misiano in that same
âSovietââcan
be truly timely and useful, especially if the matter
concerns those who resolutely oppose propaganda for realising the
principles, established in Bologna as the aim of our movementâ (
underlined by Lenin).âEd.
 



[2]
This note was written in connection with the preparations for
the Second Congress of the Communist International. Heller,
who was appointed a representative of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) in
the Italian delegation, was directed by the Politbureau of
the C.C. âto collect passages in the Italian press against
Turati and other reformists, and in general to select all the
necessary materialâ =

for exposing reformism in the ranks of the
Italian Socialist Party (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51,
p.Â 431).

Avanti!âa daily newspaper, the central organ of the Italian
Socialist Party, founded in Rome in December 1896. During the
First World War, the newspaper adopted an inconsistent
internationalist position, without breaking its ties with the reformists.
In 1926 the paper was closed down by Mussoliniâs fascist
government, but continued to be published abroad; in 1943 its
publication was resumed in Italy.

Comunismoâa fortnightly journal of the Italian Socialist
Party; it was published in Milan from 1919 to 1922, edited by
D.Â M. Serrati.

Il Sovietâa newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party,
published in Naples from 1918 to 1922. From 1920 it was the organ

 Â  

of the Communist-abstentionist
faction of the Italian Socialist Party.





[3]
This refers to the Bologna Congress of the Italian Socialist Party,
held in October 1919. The Congress decided for affiliation of the
Italian Socialist Party to the Communist International.

the agent, undertakes in exchange for raw materials to supply
from abroad miscellaneous commodities, materials, machinery,
instruments, medicaments, etc., excepting munitions;
perfumery and luxury goods, with delivery at one of the Black Sea
ports, as indicated by the agent. Second, for the supply of goods
the agent pays the Corporation in

 ... Besides the sums indicated in pointÂ 2, the agent pays
the Corporation in raw materials also a commission amounting
to ten per cent of the value of the goods supplied.
 too much! 

Fourth, the
raw materials:
tobacco, wool, oilcakes, etc., delivered by the
agent in exchange for the goods supplied, are valued at the
prices ruling on the world market at the time of delivery.... 

Urgent

other way.

Comrade Merezhin

I think an additional point should be formulated (on the
basis of the information of Rafes and others) roughly as
follows:

The experience of proletarian dictatorship in the Ukraine,
especially in those parts of it where there is a mixed
population, and also in Byelorussia (and+? +? Hungary?),
has shown that national strife not only in the form of
pogroms, of which not even the most democratic bourgeois
republic is free, but also in the form of petty but allâ
pervading squabbling is practically disappearing. The reasons
for this:
1) the interest, attention, and-all the intellectual
powers of the workers and working peasants are wholly
engrossed in the great struggle with the bourgeoisie, a
struggle that unites the working people of all nations;
2) the dictatorship of the proletariat suppresses the âfreedomâ
of action of the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie and
bourgeois intelligentsia, which freedom signifies the use of their
forces, influence and knowledge by the bourgeoisie to
inflame the class struggle.

CannotÂ 2 or more concrete facts be added?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter to Merezhin, a member of the Central Bureau of
Jewish Sections under the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), was written by Lenin
in connection with the preparation of draft theses on the national
and colonial questions for the Second Congress of the Communist
International.

The âinformation of Rafesâ refers apparently to a letter
of M.Â G. Rafes, âDefence of the rights of national minorities in
regions with a mixed population (an assessment of the experience
of Ukrainian-Jewish and Polish-Jewish relations)â, =

sent by him
to Lenin on June 21, 1920.

Here Comrade Karakhan is to blame.

He does not know how things should be done in the Soviet
Republic:

1) take an excerpt from the minutes of the Politbureau,Â 

2) on the basis of this, take a decision of the Narrow
Council (over my signature) or of the appropriate
Peopleâs Commissar,Â 
 

3) for non-fulfilment, complain to me formally after
24 hours,Â 

4) repeat this many times over.

Who does not know this, is naÃ¯ve.

Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. Despite repeated decisions of the Partyâs
Central Committee, Chicherin wrote, nothing had been done,

provision of motorcars for foreign delegations and other needs of

Comrade Zinoviev, Chairman of the Petrograd Executive
 Committee

The famous physiologist, Pavlov, asks to be allowed to
go abroad in view of his straitened circumstances. To have
Pavlov leave the country is hardly advisable, since he has
previously made statements to the effect that, being a
truthful man, he could not, in the event of the subject being
brought up in conversations, avoid expressing himself
against Soviet power and communism in Russia.

On the other hand, this scientist is such a great cultural
asset that his forcible detention in Russia in conditions
of material insecurity is unthinkable.

In view of this it would be desirable, by way of
exception, to allow him a special ration and in general to
ensure more or less comfortable circumstances for him
exclusively.

I have heard that in the Petrograd rest homes life is
very well ordered for those living there. Something of the
kind could be done for Professor Pavlov at his apartment.

Comrade Lunacharsky will make the appropriate proposal
to Comrade Badayev. I ask you to support him in this
respect.[1]

Lenin

25/VI.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin thought highly of the great Russian physiologist,
Academician I.Â P. Pavlov, the founder of the materialist theory of
higher nervous activity in animals and man. Lenin took a
solicitous interest in his well-being and gave him every possible
assistance and support.

In view of Pavlovâs outstanding scientific services, which
were of tremendous importance for the working people of the
world, the Soviet Government, on the initiative of Lenin, in the

 Â  

hard years of economic dislocation and the immense difficulties
resulting from the Civil War and foreign armed intervention,
passed a special decree creating facilities that would enable
Academician Pavlov and his assistants to effectively carry on their
scientific work (see present edition, Vol.Â 32, p.Â 69).

In his well-known letter to Soviet youth written shortly
before his death, Pavlov touched on the immense opportunities
which the Soviet socialist system offered for the development
of culture and science. âOur country,â he wrote, âis affording
great scope to scientists andâit must be ownedâscience in our
country is being fostered with a generous hand. A most lavish
hand!

âWhat is there to say about the status of our young scientist?
Here surely everything is quite clear. Much is given to him, but
much is expected from him. For the youth, as for us, it is a point
of honour to justify the great trust that our country puts in
science.â =

on the development of suburban farms and on the stocktaking

29. VI. 1920

Comrade Nikolayev,

We must definitively make use of this protocol and of
your inclusion (at last our capricious
one,[1] too, begins
to understand that there has to be an expert!), in order
radically to reorganise the whole business.

1) Study the protocol carefully and question the
mechanic at the electric station;

2) on the basis of this decide for yourself whether it is
worth while to continue the experiments;
 

3) if you think it is, we shall draw up a written, precise
constitution giving all rights to the expert (i.e., to you)â
with a guarantee from me to the inventor that we shall
keep it secret.

And then work is to be started in real earnest, i.e., by
enlisting experts for a number of auxiliary special
assignments, with the participation of one expert (you) in all
secrets.

Greetings,
 Lenin

has announced a competition for thermos vessels of large and
small dimensions. Three prizes will be awarded: for apparatus
of half a =

vedroâ10,000

(Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 434).

In a memorandum presented to Lenin on JulyÂ 16, 1920, the
Board of the Moscow Consumersâ Society reported that the
competition for thermos vessels ended on October 1, 1918.
Simultaneously with the work of the Competition Commission, the Food
Department began to use thermos vessels made entirely of wood
(plywood and shavings). These vessels were very lightâabout
32Â lbs. for vessels of three vedrosâand enabled food to be kept
hot for 18â20 hours.

Vladimir Ilyich,


I am sending you absolutely accurate information, verified on the
spot by our people, about goods intended for shipment abroad lying
at the wharves. All the goods are packed and in two weeksâ time
will go to the month of the river Ob.


We have done our part. I fear that the cost of these goods will
be 2â3 times in excess of what we shall be getting from Sweden.


Put pressure on the Commissariat for Foreign Trade to make use
of this surplus of goods.

Smirnov

Krasin

1) Return it to me with your comment.

2) Put on full pressure.

3) Give me a copy of the
measures.[1]

In reply to Leninâs note, Krasin reported on the measures taken

     To be handed to the duty commissar

Zinoviev
 Petrograd

Comrade Zinoviev,

I am sending the
theses[1]

tomorrow, Monday. Arrange
for them to be received without any delay. Kobetsky and
Vorovsky must be commissioned to prepare a business-like
criticism of the Norwegian Party and the Swedish Left Party
in time for the
Congress.[2] It is necessary to have
accurate and complete material. With regard to translations
at the Congress itself, the matter must be organised in
advance: all delegates should be seated according to
languages, so that there can be simultaneous immediate
translations for the Germans, French and English. This will
save time. Russian is obviously necessary, for it is clear
that people will insist on session in theatres.

Greetings,
 Lenin

[2]
This refers to the Second Congress of the Communist International,
which was held from July 19 to AugustÂ 7, 1920.

All the preparatory work for convening the Congress was
directed by Lenin. He wrote the theses on the national and
colonial questions, on the agrarian question, on the fundamental
tasks of the Second Congress of the Communist International, on
the terms of admission into the Communist International, and
the plan of theses on the international and economic situation
(see present edition, Vol.Â 31, pp.Â 144â64, 184â201, 206â11, 212;
Vol.Â 35, pp.Â 450â51).

At the Congress, Lenin delivered a report on the international
situation and the fundamental tasks of the Communist
International, made a speech on the role of the Communist Party,
delivered the report of the Commission on the National and Colonial
Questions, and spoke on the terms of admission into the
Communist International, on parliamentarism, and on affiliation to the
British Labour Party (see present edition, Vol.Â 31, pp.Â 215â63).
Leninâs theses were endorsed as decisions of the Congress.

My booklet on imperialism ought to be published in
German (and in other languages), for it is always a basic
issue.[1]


Your opinion?

If yes, to whom should it be entrusted?
  Â  

2

I should like to write a new preface.
What is the time limit?

Put 1â2 privatdocents on the job of finding sources in
the best libraries.

They will find
them.[2]
 

Notes
 

[1]
This refers to Leninâs book Imperialism, the Highest Stage of
Capitalism (see present edition, Vol.Â 22, pp.Â 185â304).âEd.
 



[2]
To Leninâs question in the first note as to whom to entrust the
translation of this book, Zinoviev replied that the book had

 Â  

already been translated into German and French in Petrograd and
was being edited.

Lenin wrote the new preface to the book on July 6, 1920, and
it was first published in October 1921, under the title â
Imperialism and Capitalismâ, in the journal The Communist
International No.Â 18 =

(see present edition, Vol.Â 22, pp.Â 189â94). In Leninâs
lifetime, separate editions of his book Imperialism, the Highest
Stage of Capitalism were published in German in 1921, and in
French and English (incompletely) in 1923.

Leninâs third note was a reply to a passage in Zinovievâs note
saying, âThere is some difficulty with the quotations (from
German and English publications)â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.,
Vol.Â 51, p.Â 437).

Comrade Zinoviev,

I am sending the preface to
Imperialism.[1]


Please have also the Basle Manifesto of 1912 reprinted
as an appendix. (It should not be difficult to find the
German text for you surely have Grinbergâs âarchivesâ, etc.)

I have received your theses on the Soviets and the
conditions for their establishment, but have only managed
to skim lightly through them, I do not object.

Greetings,
 Lenin

7/VII.

What about my speeches and reports at the
Congress?[2]
Is it necessary to prepare them in German or French? I
think the opening speech (and others) should be in Russian
(for, almost certainly, they will be in theatres with
Russian audience). They will be translated. And since there
are the theses I propose, while referring to them, to speak
extremely briefly. Your opinion? (The agrarian report by

  Â  

Marchlewski; for me the national report and the opening
speech, only?)

Comrade Nikolayev,

I have received your letter of 7/VII.

I am very glad you have now started properly.

I advise you
(1) to demand more officially and more
insistently that all secrets should at once be revealed to you.

(2) Set up the installation, if possible, on special wooden
supports, so that it can be removed instantaneously from
the truck (perhaps better to use a flat-car instead of a truck)
and placed on a lorry, on to the ground, and so on (for the
inventor made a successful experiment, so he says, not
in a truck).

(3) If you find that âthe game is worth the candleâ, then
donât be sparing with money and people for hastening the
work.

Greetings,
 Lenin

Comrade Gruzenberg,

Comrade Murphy has told me that the translation of
the theses contains solecisms.

You must yourself undertake (or immediately organise
a group to help) good editing of the translation of all the
theses.

Consult the English comrades about this.

Regarding Wijnkoop: I have sent Radek his statement

  Â  

(written by Wijnkoop in English). Whether the English is
good, I do not know. Take from Radek everything sent by me
(if necessary, forward this letter to him), and check, please,
if the English is good. (The content of the statement: the
Dutch Party is not responsible for âLeftismâ, the latter is
the work of certain Dutchmen.)

(Print only this statement and my statement that I am
introducing corrections in the
text.[1])

Regarding the quality of the English translations, you
must take good care and set up a group of responsible
Englishmen (with their responsibility in written form),
otherwise we shall be blamed (and so will you).

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

8/VII.

[1]
In speaking of Wijnkoopâs statement, Lenin is referring to the
letter from him of June 30, 1920, about the book âLeft-Wingâ
Communismâan Infantile Disorder, with which the Dutch delegation
became acquainted at the Second Congress of the Communist
International before translations of the Russian text had been
published. Wijnkoopâs letter and Leninâs reply to it were first
published in the English translation of the book, issued in
Moscow in 1920, and in the Russian text of the book in 1930 in the
second edition of Leninâs Collected Works (see present edition,
Vol.Â 31, pp.Â 117â18).

of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education, which reported that
the fulfilment of Leninâs directiveâfor making a motion picture of
âThe Trial of the Kolchak Ministersââwas being held up owing
to the absence of film.

Lenin sent similar letters to Centrosoyuz, the Moscow
Extraordinary Commission, the Peopleâs Commissariat for Military
Affairs and the Vecheka. On JulyÂ 9 a reply was received from the
Vecheka addressed to the secretary of the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars, Lydia Fotieva, reading: âDear Comrade Fotieva,
please tell Vladimir Ilyich that there is no cinema film, in the
Vecheka, other than shot films of a counter-revolutionary nature
which cannot be used. Apparently, someone who did not know
the facts has misled Ilyichâ =

Kamenev and Chicherin

Comrade Kamenevâs plan is utterly
incorrect.[1] Our
business with Britain is purely commercial. Chicherin is
not right. We should send to Britain only a âtradesmanâ;
if they ask 2Â 1/4 kopeks, beat them down to 1Â 3/4 kopeks.

Exposures here are harmful. This is notÂ 1918. We have
the Comintern for that. All Kamenevâs argumentsâ
arguments against his going.

Lenin

10/VII.

P.S. For the time being we shall appoint Krasin, Vorovsky
and another 2â3
assistants.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to Kamenevâs letter of JulyÂ 9, 1920, concerning the
nature of the Anglo-Russian talks, in which he wrote that
political negotiations should be conducted âon the broadest agitational
linesâ recounting âwidely and publicly the whole history of the
intervention, including Kolchak, Denikin, Poland, Wrangel,

 Â  

Lithuania, Estonia, etc., etc., and touching on and raising all
the questions of Eastern policy from Turkey to Chinaâ. =

In his
postscript to this letter Chicherin supported Kamenev, who in
turn again put forward the proposalââwithout breaking off the
negotiations, and in a mild tone, to present to Lloyd George the
history of British plundering on a world scaleâ. =

When Lenin read
the letter, he wrote on it: =

âI disagree in principle. 10/VII. Lenin.â
(Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 438.)

Leninâs letter was a reply to these proposals.





[2]

N.Â N. Krestinsky, Secretary of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), informed
Lenin on JulyÂ 11, 1920, that Chicherin was insisting that
Kamenev and not Krasin should head the Soviet delegation that
was being sent to Great Britain. Lenin wrote on Krestinskyâs
letter: âI agree to Kamenev as chairman, Krasinâdeputy
chairman.â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 438).

 Copy to Tsyurupa, Peopleâs Commissariat for Food 


Omsk, JulyÂ 9.
Half of the Altai and Tomsk gubernias are in the
grip of a kulak movement which we are suppressing by force of arms.
The cause of the insurrection is lack of commodities. From the
insurgent kulaks
we are confiscating grain, the whole of which has not
been threshed.
Work hands should be sent out urgently to thresh and
load; unless you send workers we shall not be able to take the grain.
A minimum of 7,000 is required at once for the Altai alone.
If you are
late, the opportunity will be lost. Ascertain the possibility and
inform us; if you cannot send them, we shall immediately cancel the
order for confiscation, because the kulaks will burn grain that is
unthreshed and unguarded. 

 Smirnov
 Chairman of the Siberian
 Revolutionary Committee 

I insist on all possible help. Directive from the C.C.â
make every haste. We are sending people.

Tsyurupa, Schmidt (Commissariat for Labour) and Chief
Labour Committee:

Send at once, extremely urgent, exert every effort.

Comrade Sklyansky,

The international situation, particularly Curzonâs
proposal (annexation of the Crimea in exchange for a truce
with Poland, the Grodno-Byelostok
line),[1] demands a
furious acceleration of the offensive against Poland.

Is it being done? Everything? Energetically?

Lenin
 

Notes

This refers to a Note from Lord Curzon, British Foreign Secretary,
sent to the Soviet Government on JulyÂ 11, 1920, from Spa (
Belgium), where a conference of the Entente countries was being
held together with representatives of Germany. To the decisions
adopted at the Spa conference, Lord Curzon added a proposal
that the Soviet Government should conclude an armistice with
General Wrangel.

15/VII. 1920

Dear Comrade,

Many thanks for the letters, which always contain
extremely valuable information. I enclose a letter from my
wife and ask you to give my regards to your wife and
family, whom I met at your home in London.

About your journey to Russia, I am in two minds. You
are so very important for the work in London. Let them
deport you: we shall see if they dare to do so. They would
have to catch you on something, otherwise there will be a row.
I am not against your coming âto take a lookâ at Russia,
but I am afraid that to quit Britain is harmful for the work.

As to the delegation, we shall discuss this in all aspects
in a day or so. The same with the reply to
Curzon,[2] who,
in my opinion, wants to grossly deceive us. He wonât
succeed.

About sending you literature, I have taken special
measures. You should know that a Russian has to be sworn
at 20 times and verified 30 times to have the simplest thing
done properly. Keep an eye on it and write more often (even
sometimes to me)âthen I shall push things on so that you
get the missing publications more regularly.
 

I think that your guiding participation (it is possible
by the pen and secretly) in the Anglo-Saxon movement
is especially valuable. Here it is highly important to
straighten out the line. You will receive my pamphlet
against the
âLeftistsâ[1]

and resolutions (drafts) for the
Second Congress of the Third International, and I should
very much like to know your opinion.

All the very best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

I refused to sign because it is too sweeping and vague.

I propose that it be redrafted more exactly (what, in
concrete terms, does âto take into the networkâ mean?) and
submitted a second time together with the

Notes
 
 



[1]
This note was written on the draft of a decree for centralising
libraries in the Republic, adopted by the Narrow Council of
Peopleâs Commissars on JuneÂ 22, 1920. To eliminate duplication
of work and ensure effective use and proper distribution of all
existing book-collections, the draft stipulated that âthe libraries
of all public organisations and institutions are to be merged in
the general library network of the Educational Departmentsâ. =

All libraries newly opened by public organisations were to be
included âin the general network of public librariesâ.

The draft decree also bears a note from Krupskaya to the
Peopleâs Commissariat for Education: âIf you will send me my
article on the centralisation of libraries and return this draft,
I will try to make a new draft and write an instruction. But
perhaps it has already been done? In that case, send it as well.â

Kamenev

1. The utmost attention must be paid to collecting
English writings showing that trade agreements with the

  Â  

Soviet Republics arc more advantageous to the British
bourgeoisie than unprofitable and even ruinous attempts to
crush them. It is necessary to collect such writings for us,
and besides this, to discuss with knowledgeable people
whether in addition it would not be expedient to employ
some kind of literary bureau or agency for the publication
of such pamphlets, for giving lectures, and for their
distribution, etc. You, of course, know whom one should
consult in the first place about this.

2. It is necessary to organise through special people
the regular collection, purchase, without stinting money,
and dispatch to us in 5 copies, of books, articles, pamphlets,
newspaper cuttings, particularly in English, but also in
other languages, on questions of modern economics. As
an example, Keynesâs Economic Consequences of the Peace.
This is the sort of publication that should be collected
systematically.

3. Do the same, but only through special people, for
the collection and dispatch to us in 20Â copies of periodical
publications of all kinds, and especially pamphlets and
minutes of the following four trends: 1âcommunist, 2â
Centrist (for example, the Independent Labour Party in
Britain), 3âanarchist or near to it, 4âsyndicalist,
etc.

4. All this should be properly organised by a legal
agreement, through someone who must be a British subject
and not a Communist.

5. Please send me personally:
1âgood recent reference
books and summary statistical publications, geographical,
political and economic, particularly in English and French,
which are more easily obtainable in London, and
2âtwo
good thermos flasks.

The peace proposal by the Poles gives us an opportunity
for more systematic use of the troops which it was intended
to transfer from the Caucasian Front to the Western Front.
I propose, therefore, that the Council of Defence draft a
decision as follows:

1. The troops of the Caucasian Front to march through
the entire Ukraine, the route being so calculated that each
volost (of the approximately 1,900 volosts of the Ukraine)
is passed through twice, first by a cavalry unit and then,
after an interval, an infantry unit, to fulfil (and then check
fulfilment of) the following tasks:

(a) the collection of food (according to the quotas to
be requisitioned);

(b) the formation locally, i.e., in every village, of a
double (compared to the quota) stock of food (collected
in barns, in houses of priests, landowners, the rich,
etc.), this stock to be guarded by the local peasants
on their responsibility.

This double stock is to serve as an exchange fund;
from this stock held by the peasants, grain will be
taken after the local peasants have been supplied

  Â  

with goods, Russian and foreign, by agreement with
the local peasants;

(c) the compilation (and checking) of a list of â
responsibleâ peasants (5â20%, etc., of the householders of
each village, depending on its size, to be selected from
the local rich peasants starting from the top, i.e.,
according to wealth).

The âresponsibleâ peasants are to be personally
answerable for the fulfilment of food and other
assignments of the authorities.

After the departure of the troops, the special task
of the local authorities will be to ensure the proper
and safe keeping of this list (for non-fulfilment of this
taskâdeath sentence);

(d) the disarming of the rich peasants.

Complete collection of arms. Responsibility for
undiscovered arms rests on the commander of the
army unit; for non-declaration of arms it rests on
the person with whom they are found (death sentence),
and on the whole group of
âresponsibleâ peasants (a
fine, not in money, but in grain and articles;
confiscation of property, arrest; work in the mines);

(e) assistance in sowing the fields, in repairs to
agricultural implements, and other necessary work (
guarding stores or checking the guard over them, work
on the railways, etc.) (guarding stores of salt, etc.).

2. For the purposes indicated above, a commissar or
instructor to be added to each army unit (to its Communist
cell) (muster 1,000 people if necessary from the Petrograd,
Moscow, Ivanovo-Voznesensk workers) to control fulfilment
of the tasks mentioned.

3. In âstubbornâ volosts or villages, the army units
either to organise a âthird visitâ (by troops) or to remain
longer billeted (up to 2Â weeks) for punishment and
correction.

4. Part of these decisions to be put through the Defence
Council, part through the Council of the Labour Army
and the Council of Peopleâs Commissars of the Ukraine.

5. A highly popular leaflet to be published for the
peasants to explain matters in general, and the idea of the stocks
of food for exchange for foreign goods, in particular.
 

A commission to be set up at once for publishing such
a leaflet, and a series of them, as well as a number of
instructions.

For drafting these proposals, a commission to be set
up at once consisting of Comrades Bryukhanov and
Sklyansky. Comrade Stalin to be asked to be the chairman of the
commission.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of Defence

Stalin:

I do not quite understand why you are dissatisfied with
the separation of the fronts. Let me know your reasons.
It seemed to me to be necessary since the Wrangel danger
is increasing. As to a deputy, let me know your opinion

  Â  

about a candidate. Please inform me also what promises
the Commander-in-Chief is late with. Our diplomacy is
subordinated to the C.C. and will never disrupt our
successes, if the Wrangel danger does not cause
vacillations within the Central Committee. From the Kuban
area and the Don Region we are getting alarming, even
desperate, telegrams about the menacing growth of the
insurgent movement. They are insisting on more speed in
defeating Wrangel.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was written in reply to the following telegram
from Stalin, sent on AugustÂ 2, 1920, from Lozovaya: âFierce

 Â  

fighting is continuing with growing intensity; today we shall
probably lose Alexandrovsk. I received your note concerning
the separation of the fronts. The Politbureau ought not to
concern itself with trifles. I can go on working at the front for two
weeks at the most, I need a rest, find someone to replace me. I do
not believe the promises of the Commander-in-Chief for a single
minute, by his promises he only lets us down. As regards the
sentiments of the Central Committee in favour of peace with
Poland, one cannot help remarking that our diplomacy sometimes
very successfully torpedoes the results of our military successesâ =

We should say (in regard to the frontier) that we shall
give more (the line will be farther to the
east),[1]

but not say:
âmuchâ more, much farther to the east.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to Polandâs Eastern frontier, which was arbitrarily
fixed by the Supreme Council of the Entente at the end of the
1914â18 imperialist war, on DecemberÂ 8, 1919. This frontier was
to run along the line: GrodnoâYalovkaâNemirovâBrest-Litovsk
âDoroguskâUstilugâKrylov, and was to cut across Galicia
between Przemysl and Rava-Russkaya up to the Carpathian
Mountains. This line was mentioned also in Lord Curzonâs Note of
JulyÂ 11, 1920, and became known as the âCurzon Lineâ.

The Soviet Government, in proposing peace to Poland, was
ready to accept as the Polish-Soviet frontier a line east of the
âCurzon Lineâ.

The present note is Leninâs directive to the chairman of the
Soviet delegation sent to London for negotiations with the British
Government.

Stalin

I apologise for the delay in replying, due to the end of
the work of the Comintern. The plenary meeting of the
Central Committee did not adopt any
decisions[1]

that alter
the established policy. Britain is threatening war, she does
not want to wait later than Monday, AugustÂ 9. I donât
much believe the threats. Kamenev in London is also
standing firm so far, and I am convinced that your successes
against Wrangel will help to put an end to the vacillations
within the Central Committee. In general, however, much
still depends on Warsaw and its
fate.[2]

Danishevsky

From Chicherin you will learn of our great diplomatic
success in Britain in regard to Poland. I hope you will
be fully able to take this into account and cleverly include
in the terms both Warsaw, as we agreed, and the firmest
guarantee of all the rest.

11. VIII. 1920

Comrade Krestinsky

Comrade Shapovalov (Alexander Isidorovich) is one of
the old Party comrades. A Petrograd worker.

I knew him very well in the Party while still abroad,
where he always worked like a cart-horse.
 

Now he is ill. He is badly in need of extra nourishment.

Cannot it be arranged for him to use the Kremlin
dining-room? I earnestly request this and a ration (increased)
for him, and help of every kind.

Comrade Kursky,

Who is it publishes so
badly?[1]

Chaos. Even the heading is not clear.

A collection of triviaâand of proclamations.

Who edited itâsome stupid person or a saboteur?

The most important legislation in force now, 1920, ought
to be published in a similar volume.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a collection of the decrees in force in 1919. In a
letter in reply, Kursky reported that this collection was published
under the editorship of Kozlovsky and was a reprint of Sobraniye
 Â  

uzakonenii za 1919 god (Collected Legislation of 1919), and that
another collection of the most important decrees of the R.S.F.S.R.
during the three years, 1917â20, was being prepared for the press.
On the envelope of Kurskyâs letter, Lenin wrote: âFor the
archives (VIII. 1920). =

Re publication of laws


]â (Collected
Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 444).

Comrade Krestinsky,

Is it not possible somehow to make a check through a
strict commission? Voznesensky was working effectively.

Is there not some irregularity about his removal?
personal? squabbling?

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with a letter from A.Â N. Voznesensky,
formerly head of the Eastern Department of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, who considered that he had been
wrongfully dismissed. The matter was discussed on AugustÂ 19,
1920, at the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), which directed
Chicherin to use Voznesensky in one of the subcommissions of
the Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Affairs as a specialist
on the eastern question having a knowledge of Eastern languages
and English.

14. VIII. 1920

Comrade Chicherin,

I hope you will fully inform Kamenev of all the facts
showing that France and Daszynski are torpedoing the
meeting in
Minsk?[1]

This is essential. Very, very much so.

Danishevsky must be told that he should begin with a
solemn declaration ofÂ 

(a) independence and sovereignlyÂ 

(b) a frontier giving more than
Curzonâs[2]

(c) no indemnities. Isnât that so?

In reply to Kamenevâs request I am sending you for
coding:
  Â  

      To Kamenev in code

In my opinion, the whole point is that France and
Daszynski are torpedoing the actual meeting in Minsk. They
will probably also prevent the armistice. I am hoping that
Britain will be unable to fight, and without her everything
falls to the ground. There is practically no news from
Poland. The little there is confirms our decision at the C.C.
plenum, namely, extreme vigilance, and we are bound to
win this campaign. That we have roused the workersâ
this is already no small gain. Lenin.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. Britain is trying to prove that we are torpedoing
the meeting. All the documents must be sent urgently to
Kamenev.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the conference for ending the war and
establishing peaceful friendly relations between the R.S.F.S.R. and
the Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland, on the other.
Despite all the attempts of the imperialists to prevent it, the peace
conference began its work on AugustÂ 17, 1920, in Minsk, where it
continued until SeptemberÂ 3. On SeptemberÂ 21, the conference
resumed its work in Riga. The peace negotiations ended with the
signing in Riga on OctoberÂ 12, 1920, of âA Treaty on an Armistice
and Preliminary Conditions of Peaceâ between Soviet Russia and
the Soviet Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland, on the other
(see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.Â III, Moscow, 1959,
pp.Â 245â58).

The Commander-in-Chief dare not fret. If the military
department or the Commander-in-Chief does not reject the
idea of capturing Warsaw, we must capture it (what extra
measures for this? tell me).

To talk of expediting the armistice when the enemy is
attacking, is idiocy.

Once the Poles have gone over to an offensive along the
entire line, one should not whimper (like Danishevsky) for
that is ridiculous.

A counter-move should be devised: military measures (
enveloping, dragging out all negotiations, etc.).

Smilga

The offensive of the Poles makes it very important for
us to increase our pressure, if only for a few days. Do
everything possible. If you consider it useful, issue an order to

  Â  

the troops telling them that by a tenfold effort now, they
will ensure for Russia favourable terms of peace for many
years.

19/VIII.

Smilga
 Minsk

Comrade Trotsky will inform you in detail of the decision
of the
Politbureau,[1] from which you will learn that we
fully share your view. It is essential to strain all efforts so
that the Byelorussian workers and peasants, even if in bast
shoes and unclothed, but immediately, with revolutionary
speed, would give you three and four times as many
reinforcements.

Further, agitation from aeroplanes for the Polish workers
and peasants, to the effect that their capitalists are
preventing peace and are condemning them to needless
bloodshed, should be increased tenfold.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a decision of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
dated AugustÂ 19, 1920, following the reports by Stalin and Trotsky
on the military situation on the Polish and Wrangel fronts. In the
decision it was recorded: =

âa) To recognise the Wrangel front as
the main front.... =

b) To convene the Orgbureau tomorrow to decide
the question of a further mobilisation of Communists, =

c) To
adopt extra measures to speed up general mobilisation of
Byelorussians, =

d) To transfer the 6th Division of the 1st Mounted Army
to the Wrangel front.... =

e) To send 55 per cent of the mobilised
Communists to the Wrangel front, and the remainder to the
Western Front.â =

(Sklyansky knows the address and code)

Let us know in greater detail what you are doing to raise
the Galician peasants. Armaments have been sent to you. Are
they sufficient? Crush the Polish landowners and the kulaks
ruthlessly so that the farm hands, and the mass of the
peasants, feel there has been a sharp turn in their favour. Are
you using aeroplanes for
agitation?[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The summer of 1920 saw the beginning of the liberation of the
Western Ukraine by the Red Army. The rule of the bourgeoisie
and landowners was abolished in 16Â uyezds of Eastern Galicia
and Soviet power was established there. A provisional regional
Soviet authority in Eastern Galiciaâthe Galician
Revolutionary Committee headed by V.Â P. Zatonskyâwas set up in
Ternopol. In the uyezds, local revolutionary committees were
formed, which strove to enforce the decrees of the peopleâs
government. Lenin warmly welcomed the establishment of Soviet power

 Â  

in Eastern Galicia and helped the Galician Communists in their
Party and Soviet activities.

Comrade Pokrovsky

1) What is the legal status of
Proletcult?[1]

2) What is the nature of its leading centre and 3) by
whom was it appointed?

4) How is it financed by the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Education?

5) Anything else of importance about the position, role
and results of the work of Proletcult.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Proletcultâa cultural and educational organisation which arose
in September 1917 as an independent workersâ organisation. Its
leadership was in the hands of A.Â A. Bogdanov and his
supporters. After the October Revolution, Proletcult continued to uphold
its âindependenceâ, thus setting itself in opposition to the Soviet
state. In consequence, Proletcult was infiltrated by bourgeois
intellectuals who began to exert a decisive influence on it. Its
members actually denied the importance of the cultural heritage,
wanted to shut themselves off from the tasks of cultural and
educational work among the masses, and tried to create a special
âproletarian cultureâ by âlaboratory methodsâ, in isolation from
life. In a draft resolution âOn Proletarian Cultureâ (see present
edition, Vol.Â 31, pp.Â 316-17) and in a number of other works,
Lenin trenchantly criticised the erroneous principles of
Proletcult. In the early 1920s its organisations began to decline and in
1932 it ceased to exist.

Orjonikidze

We have passed a decision through the Politbureau
today for you to go without fail to Rostov for closest
participation in liquidating the landings in the Kuban and Black
Sea
area.[1] Strain every effort and push this on, report to
me more frequently. Get someone to take your place in
Baku. Another request: donât forget you promised me to
arrange for treatment for Inessa Armand and her sick son,
who left on AugustÂ 18; they are, probably, already in
Rostov.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the landing in the Kuban area in the middle of
August 1920 of a whiteguard force, organised by Wrangel with
the consent and support of the Entente. The aim of the raid was
to cut off from the Soviet Republic one of the most fertile grain
areas of the country. As a result of stubborn, fierce battles, the
Red Army routed the whiteguard units and in the beginning of
September the remnants of the landing force were thrown back
into the Crimea.

Kamenev in code

It is hardly likely that we shall capture Warsaw
soon.[1]

The enemy there has built up strength and is attacking.
Obviously, Lloyd George is deliberately dividing up the
roles with Churchill, using pacifist phrases to conceal the
real policy of the French and Churchill and duping the
Henderson-and-Co. fools. Do your utmost to bring this home
to the British workers; write articles and theses for them
yourself, teach Marxism concretely, teach them to make use
of the leftward swings of the Hendersons, teach them
agitation among the massesâthat is your main task. Lloyd
George has been duping us with pacifism and has helped
Churchill to land assistance for the Poles in Danzig. That
is the essence of the matter. Maintain contact with the
Rumanian Ambassador.


Lenin[2]


Comrade Chicherin,

Send it if you have no objection. If you have, weâll talk
it over on the telephone.

Lenin

I propose replying:

The present moment is definitely unsuitable, while we
are retreating from Warsaw. Send the most detailed and

  Â  

exact information about Lithuania over the signature of
all the members of the Lithuanian-Byelorussian Central
Committee and Smilgaâs opinion. But continue the
preparatory work more cautiously and systematically.

There is agreement from three members of the Political
Bureau.[1]


Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
This sentence, the signature and the words âon behalf of the
Politbureau, Krestinskyâ were written by Lenin after receiving the
agreement of the members of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.),
âEd.
 



[2]
Written below the text of the copy of a telegram sent to Lenin
from Vilno on August 19, 1920, by V.Â S. Mickiewicz-Kapsukas,
a member of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian-Byelorussian
Communist Party. He reported that revolutionary feeling in
Lithuania was rising and âby the day of our departure from Vilno,
it may end in a mass armed uprising against the Lithuanian
whiteguardsâ, =

and asked: âDo you find it possible for us to prepare for
a decisive battle?â

On the same copy Lenin wrote to Trotsky: âComrade Trotsky,
if you agree, send it off or return it to me for coding. Lenin.â
On the document there is also a note by Lenin: âStalin agreesâ,
and Trotskyâs mark indicating his agreement.

Comrade Zinoviev

For the Committee of the 1st State Cartographical
 Institute (formerly A.Â Ilyinâs)
 5, Pryazhka

Thank you very much for sending another copy of the
atlas Railways of Russia, and please do not forget that if
a new atlas is to be published giving the new
administrative divisions, it is essential very carefully to collect
information from the Peopleâs Commissariats about the
boundaries both of the new gubernias and also of the Tatar,
Bashkir and other republics, regions and communes (
German, Chuvash), and others.

It is unlikely that this can be done without a commission
under the Council of Peopleâs Commissars.

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)

Tell Chicherin,

1) In my opinion, Kamenev is right: we must send our
reply through him (and in the negative).

2) Negotiations with Vanderlip to be begun through
Krasin, exact terms to be ascertained without summoning
Vanderlip
here.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telegram to Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs
Chicherin on July 30, 1920, M.Â M. Litvinov, plenipotentiary abroad
of the R.S.F.S.R. Council of Peopleâs Commissars, reported the
arrival in Copenhagen of the American industrialist Vanderlip,
who wanted to obtain a concession to exploit oil, coal, and the
fisheries of Primorye Region and Kamchatka.

In the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U., there is a note written by
Lenin on Chicherinâs letter dated AugustÂ 21, 1920, in which
Lenin agrees to Vanderlip visiting Moscow.


Vanderlip arrived in Moscow on SeptemberÂ 17, 1920, to
negotiate an agreement for the concessions. On the same day
Chicherin wrote to Lenin suggesting that negotiations with Vanderlip
be started at once and setting out his views on the subject. Lenin
wrote on this letter: âComrade Chicherin, I am wholly in favour
of negotiations. Hasten them. Think over what more should be
done for directives to Krasnoshchokov.â =

(Collected Works, Fifth
Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 448.)

An inter-departmental commission of representatives of the
Supreme Economic Council, the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs and the Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Trade,
was set up to conduct the negotiations. In agreeing to offer a
concession to Vanderlipâs syndicate, the Soviet Government
aimed not only at establishing mutually profitable co-operation
with American business circles, but also at normalising relations
between Soviet Russia and the U.S.A. In a letter to the
Vanderlip syndicate on NovemberÂ 1, 1920, Chicherin pointed out: â
Independently of the signing of a concession agreement, the
Government of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic
assumes that the agreement will come into force only on the
resumption of normal deÂ facto relations between the Government of
Russia and the Government of the U.S.A., and on condition that
such relations will be established before JulyÂ 1, 1921.â =

However, this condition was not fulfilled, hence the concession
agreement with Vanderlip was not finalised and did not come into
effect.

Krestinsky
 for the Orgbureau

I agree with Krestinsky that Preobrazhensky âdidnât make
a success of itâ.

It should be more detailed, more agitational, with more
feelingâand clearer and more business-like.

Let Zinoviev write it (he will be here tomorrow, 25/8),
and the Orgbureau will correct
it.[1]

This refers to the circular letter of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) drafted
by Y.Â A. Preobrazhensky on the basis of his report dealing with
signs of demoralisation in the Party. Commenting on this draft,
Krestinsky wrote: âI consider that the reservation contained at
the end of pointÂ V, which speaks of eliminating inequality in
living conditions, âin so far as they are not due to the
requirements of the workâ, should be elaborated as a separate point or,
perhaps, even as a separate section of the circular.

âThe point is that the living conditions of gubernia Party
and Soviet officials are very hard, especially now that we are
carrying out transfers on a mass scale and tearing most comrades
away from the places where they had all kinds of family
connections and links with the countryside.

âThe comrades are suffering hunger, and since, in addition,
they are overworked, they very soon become exhausted and put
out of action for a long time or permanently. It is essential
to get the mass of Party members to recognise the need of
establishing somewhat better, less famished conditions of life for the
small number of active revolutionary cadres.

âIf the above idea is sufficiently emphasised and elaborated
in the circular, the last two lines of the draft, which very
cautiously and not very intelligibly condemn demagogy on the grounds
of inequality, will become superfluous.

âIn the discussion in the commission, Comrade

 Â  

Preobrazhensky did not deny the need to include in the circular the idea of
a certain inevitable temporary inequality, but he somehow
failed to make his point.â =

(Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51,
p.Â 449.)

The Orgbureauâs text of the letter from the C.C., R.C.P.(B.),
âTo All Party Organisations, to All Party Membersâ, signed by
Krestinsky, was sent to Lenin for approval. On this letter
Lenin wrote that he agreed with the text and proposed the
insertion in the letter of âa quotation from the Party programme to
the effect that for the present there cannot be equalityâ. This
refers to clauseÂ 8 of the economic section of the programme. See
KPSS v rezolyutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, conferentsii t
plenumov TsK (C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and Decisions of
Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of Its Central
Committee), PartÂ I, 1954, p.Â 423.

The circular letter of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) was published on
SeptemberÂ 4, 1920, in Izvestia of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) No.Â 21.

Comrade Sergo,

I am sending you reports delivered to me. Return them,
please, with your remarks about the facts: what is true,
what is
untrue.[1]

I daresay you get into a bad temper, on occasion, donât
you?
 

You ought to get some assistants, perhaps, and direct
the work more systematically.

I hope you will not take offence at my remarks and will
reply frankly what you think you can straighten out and
correct, and how.

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

[1]
On August 27, 1920, Orjonikidze received Leninâs letter, to which
were appended extracts from a letter by A.Â S. Serafimovich, who
in the summer of 1920 was in the Caucasus. Being misinformed
about the political work of Party and administrative functionaries
in the Caucasus, Serafimovich in his letter adduced a number of
alleged facts casting a slur on the revolutionary activity of
Orjonikidze, a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the
Caucasian Front. In returning these extracts to Lenin, Orjonikidze
refuted all the accusations against him as being false and
groundless.

On receiving this reply, Lenin wrote: âI think Sergo (=
Orjonikidze) is incapable of lying.â (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.,
Vol.Â 51, p.Â 450.)

I agree, with the obligatory addition to this conclusion
(âreprimandâ): do not dare to introduce departmental
polemics, do not dare to browbeat the Supreme Economic
Council, the Commissariat for Food and other Peopleâs
Commissariats.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in reply to a letter to Lenin dated August 27, 1920, from
N.Â N. Krestinsky, Secretary of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), concerning
an article by A.Â Kolegayev, âThe Scalp Huntersâ, published
in the newspaper Gudok No.Â 77. The author of the article
attacked the Food Commissariat for requisitioning the grain
brought to Moscow by one of the departments of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Railways. Krestinsky proposed that the author
of the article and the editors of Gudok should be censured for
such impermissible publications. On SeptemberÂ 1, 1920, the
Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) reprimanded Kolegayev and the
editors of Gudok and warned the editors âon no account to allow
publication of articles of a departmental-polemical nature
aimed against the Supreme Economic Council, the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Food or other Commissariatsâ =

Comrade Dzerzhinsky,

I enclose a coded message from Comrade
Beloborodov.[1]

In my opinion the danger is immense.

I propose:Â 

the adoption of a directive from the Political Bureau

asking the Orgbureau, by arrangement with the
Commissariat for Military Affairs and the Vecheka, to draw
up emergency measures to combat the danger of a
revolt and to mobilise sufficient army, Cheka and Party
forces.

Please hand all this at once to Comrade Krestinsky (he
will be away for only a few hours today) and for your part
adopt all measures at once.

If we are faced with a revolt on the Kuban, our whole
policy (which was spoken about in the C.C.) will crash. It
is necessary, at all costs, to prevent a revolt, and not to
grudge people or efforts for this. Should we not send Mantsev
there?

Yours,
 Lenin

Written on a copy of a telegram from V.Â M. Sverdlov, Deputy
Peopleâs Commissar for Railways, sent on AugustÂ 27, 1920, from
Saratov, requesting that textiles, footwear and household
articles be issued for 345Â families of railwaymen, who had been
the victims of a fire. Owing to the absence of clothing, wrote
Sverdlov, they could not go to work, and this threatened an
interruption in railway traffic.

Dear Vladimir Ilyich,


Only my desperate situation compels me to trouble you with a most
humble request. I am 74 years old, for 51 of them I have served my
dear Moscow to the best of my strength and ability.... Knowing how
crowded are the conditions in which the population is living, I met
the authorities halfway and voluntarily gave up several rooms in my
little house. All that remains are rooms that I need for myself or cold
communicating rooms unsuitable for living in. Now they threaten to
take these rooms away as well. I implore you to help me.... A few
words, written by your order, will be sufficient guarantee for me.


 With sincere respect,
 Honoured Artist of the State Maly Theatre,
 N.Â Nikulina 

Check and phone that she is to be left in peace.

the peasants handed their petition to Lenin on SeptemberÂ 5, 1920,
during a halt in the village of Bogdanovo when he was out
hunting. The peasants complained that the local village Soviet had
requisitioned from the poor peasants all their grain and seed
corn, grossly distorting the policy of the Party and the
government.

Lenin followed up this petition the very next day; an
investigation was made and the guilty persons were severely punished.

Comrade Trotsky,

This was received today in reply to my night inquiry
about âpseudonymâ (he has been summoned, to us here, and
inquiries have been made of
Gusev[4]...Â .[1]

Gusev does not
object.

But his report about a big defeat of the 13th Army is
extremely alarming and extremely important.

In my opinion, it is necessary to treat this with the
utmost seriousness in view of the whole situation and
1)
inquire at once of the Commander-in-Chief,
2) raise this
evening in the
C.C.Â ...[2]


...[3]
whether to appoint Frunze commander of the front
against Wrangel and to put Frunze in at
once.[5] I have
asked Frunze to have a talk with you as soon as possible.
Frunze says he has studied the Wrangel front, has prepared
himself for that front and knows (from his experience of the
Urals Region) the methods of struggle against the Cossacks.

This refers to a code message which Lenin received on September
8, 1920, from S.Â I. Gusev, a member of the Revolutionary
Military Council of the South-Western Front, reporting proposals by
âpseudonymâ, a deserter, the former Lieutenant Yakovlev, who
had made his way through the 13thÂ Army to Headquarters of
the South-Western Front. The gist of Yakovlevâs proposals was
this: âA secret organisation of officers has been formed in
Wrangelâs army aimed at blowing up Wrangel from within and handing
over his whole army to the Soviet government. In the organisation
there are some thirty General Staff officers. The organisation intends
to overthrow Wrangel and proclaim his army the Red Crimean
Army under the command of Brusilov. The Russian Government
is asked to give real guarantees of a full amnesty for the whole
array without exception, and issue a corresponding proclamation
by the Commander-in-Chief. As proof of the seriousness of the
proposal, Yakovlev is prepared to give away the leaders of
Wrangelâs organisation operating in Soviet Russia with the aim...
of preparing an armed uprising. Temporarily, until the arrival of
Brusilov, the command of the Red Crimean Army will be
entrusted to General Staff officer Sokolovsky, leader of the

 Â  

conspiracy against Wrangelâ =

M.Â V. Frunze was appointed commander of the forces of the
Southern Front by decision of a plenary meeting of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
held on September 20â21, 1920.

 9. IX. 1920

Trotsky

I consider of the utmost importance Yakovlevâs proposal
concerning the Crimean army which was passed on to you
from Gusev. I advise that the proposal be adopted and a
special check instituted, and, independently of this, an
appeal-manifesto be prepared at once over the signatures of
yourself, Kalinin, myself, the Commander-in-Chief,
Brusilov and a number of other former generals, with precise
proposals and guarantees, and also mentioning the fate of
Eastern Galicia and the increasing insolence of the Poles.
I request your earliest opinion, or better still your draft
of the
manifesto.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Regarding Yakovlevâs proposals, see NoteÂ 450.

The âAppeal to Officers of the Army of Baron Wrangelâ
signed by Kalinin, Chairman of the All-Russia C.E.C.; Lenin,
Chairman of the Council of Peopleâs Commissars; Trotsky,
Peopleâs Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs; S.Â S. Kamenev,
Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Republic;
and Brusilov, Chairman of the Special Council of the
Commander-in-Chief, was published on September 12, 1920, =

in Pravda No.Â 202.
The Appeal called on the officers of Wrangelâs army to renounce
the shameful role of serving the Polish landowners and French
usurers, and to lay down their arms aimed against their own
people. Those who sincerely and voluntarily came over to the
side of Soviet power were guaranteed a full amnesty.

Rykov
 Supreme Economic Council
 Lezhava
 Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Trade

The various big timber export deals concluded by our
London Trade Delegation are of great political and
economic importance. They virtually break the blockade. The
most serious attention, therefore, should be given to the
precise and careful execution of these contracts, in
accordance with the terms agreed on. Please give immediately
all the relevant instructions along these lines and establish
effective control over their implementation.
 

At the same time there is obvious need for increasing
our export stock to the utmost, primarily by stepping up
the procurement of timber for export. In order to make the
latter a priority job, please draft and submit to the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars as soon as possible a decree
on the measures that should be adopted, indicating among
them the organisation of control over the bodies in charge
of the procurement of raw materials for
export.[1]

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Peopleâs Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On September 28, 1920, Lenin signed a decree of the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars drawn up by Lezhava (Peopleâs Commissar
for Foreign Trade) and D.Â I. Kursky (Peopleâs Commissar for
Justice) on procurement of raw materials for export.

Comrade Kalinin,

Comrade Ilyin asks that he and his family should be
left in his old rooms in the former Metropole Hotel until
the spring,Â 

because the doctors certify that his wife and children
are very ill and require the best possible position and
conditions during an operation to be undergone in the
winter.

Knowing Comrade Ilyin since before the revolution, from
abroad, I earnestly request you to help him arrange this.

Comrade Lezhava,

You should urgently see Zimmerman and raise the
following in the Politbureau:

Platten through his courier (Zimmerman, a Communist
from Switzerland, who is now here and leaves tomorrow,
21/IX) asksÂ 

for his mandate as trade representative of the R.S.F.S.R.
in Switzerland to be continued and confirmed, as thisÂ 

1) will help him, Flatten, to be released from prison (he has
already begun to serve his 6âmonth sentence) ahead of time;

2) will strengthen his position in the communist
movement.

Platten must be helped with money: he is in dire straits.

2) The limit of territorial concessions on our part can be the
frontier along the river Shara,
the Oginsky Canal, the rivers Yaselda and
Styr and further along the state frontier between Russia and Eastern
Galicia. Shifting our frontier still more to the east would create
extremely difficult strategic conditions for us, depriving us of such
important railway junctions as Baranovichi, Luninets, Sarny and
Rovno. Moreover, the state of our armies and the strategic position
in general do not call for such a big sacrifice....

This is the frontierâmaximum. Adopted in the C.C. It
must be repeated
exactly.[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs note to Chicherin was written on a report from

of the two countries at the peace conference in Riga.

Today in code to Joffe on behalf of the C.C. plenum.

For us, the crux of the matter is: first, that we have an
armistice in a short time; second, and this is the main thing,
that we have a real guarantee of real peace within 10Â days.
Your task is to ensure this and check on the reality of
the guarantee of actual fulfilment. If you do ensure this,
give the maximum concessions up to the line along the
river Shara, the Oginsky Canal, the rivers Yaselda
and Styr and further along the state frontier between
Russia and Eastern Galicia. If, however, in spite of all
our efforts and concessions this can in no way be ensured,
then your only task is to expose the delay of the Poles and
definitely prove to us the inevitability of a winter campaign.

Comrade Chicherin,

It is necessary:

1) To put before the C.C. another draft of a precise
decision: the C.C. prohibits acting in such-and-such a way,
and demands so-and-so.

2) To lodge a protest against each violation concretely.

3) To put through the C.C. the appointment of a 
responsible person (not a very âhighâ one).

Otherwise the result is nothing but grousing.

Very urgent

Gillerson
 Prague

Publish at once in the press and inform the Congress
of the Czechoslovak Social-Democratic
Party[1] that Franz
Bene&swhattheâs mention of a talk alleged to have taken place with
me on the possibility or impossibility of a proletarian
dictatorship in Czechoslovakia is a lie from beginning to end
and that not only did I never talk with him but I have
never even seen him. It goes without saying that my opinion
of Bela Kun and of the Hungarian Revolution, as quoted
by Bene&swhatthe, is just as foul a lie.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The reference is to the Thirteenth Congress of the Czechoslovak
Social-Democratic Workersâ Party, held in Prague from
SeptemberÂ 25 to 28, 1920. The Congress was preceded by a struggle between
the revolutionary wing in the partyâthe Marxist Left wingâ
and the Right-wing reformist leadership. The Congress was
attended by 321 persons, all supporters of the Left wing. At that
time the party had more than 4,800 functioning organisations
and almost 500,000 members. The Left wing at the Congress took
over the leadership of the party and formed an independent party
entitled the Czechoslovak Social-Democratic Workersâ Party
(Left). It included most of the members of the former
Social-Democratic Party. The Congress condemned the splitting policy
of the Right wing, expressed agreement with the conditions for
affiliation to the Communist International, and instructed the
new Executive Committee to conduct negotiations for joining
the Communist International. The reformist leaders took the
course of splitting the party and in November 1920 held their
own Congress.

Comrade I.Â N. Smirnov,

I am sending you for consideration the following
points.[1]
Drop me a line about them.

Yours,
 Lenin

1. Attention to be paid to the rural poor of Siberia, who
are to be supplied with food from the local requisition
quotas.

2. Tar production to be organised in Siberia, enlisting
the local Soviets and the populationÂ 

(local tar production).
 

3. The peasants obtain a pood of wheat and mill it into
the finest flour, getting 18â20 pounds. It would be better
to mill into simple flour, the peasants will agree to this.

4. Special attention to be paid to the village
blacksmithsâ shops for repairs to agricultural machinery. Charcoal
to be supplied to them.

Is it true that there have been instances in Siberia of
butter being used to grease carts (instead of tar)?

Lenin

26. IX. 20
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On September 17, 1920, Lenin had a talk with S.Â I. Poroskun,
a member of the Moscow Bureau of the Siberian Revolutionary
Committee, who had returned from Siberia, and made notes of
the measures proposed by Poroskun for helping the Siberian
peasantry (see Lenin Miscellany XXXV, p.Â 151). The results of this
conversation and the measures proposed by Poroskun are reflected
in this letter of Leninâs to the Siberian Revolutionary Committee.

Comrade G.Â M. Krzhizhanovsky

Gleb Maximilianovich,

Please return this to me, after reading pp.Â 20â21, with
a couple of words.

Yours,
 Lenin


... Undoubtedly, in the early stages we, as is done nowadays in
ail Europe and America, have to pay
particular attention to the
rational utilisation of the
already existing electro-technical equipment.

|||| N.B. 
At the present time,
the accelerated setting
in full motion of our
main
existing power stations,
the combined work of a group of stations,
and the rational use of the electrical networks, may have an
importance which it is difficult to overestimate.  


Recently, throughout the provinces, we observe a widespread
tendency towards the construction of new small stations, particularly
in those cases where it is possible to use some kind of water power.
However vital this trend may be, we should not forget that from the
point of view of expediency in the matter of electrification only
big district power stations are
 N.B. 

a decisive factor....  
 


... At present three-quarters of the work is finished,
and in
the middle of July we shall start on a final summary for
presenting a report on the matter to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars.
Only when this work is completely finished, will I be able to give
you a more concrete account of what we mean when we speak of the
electrification of agriculture, industry and transport in Russia,
having in view a definite sequence of works embracing, approximately,
the period of the next ten years.

 G.Â Krzhizhanovsky  

This is where the question arises: up to now, in all five
numbers of the Bulletin, we have had only long-term
âschemesâ and âplansâ, but nothing immediate.

What exactly (precisely) is lacking for âaccelerating the
setting in motion of the existing power stationsâ?

This is the crux. Yet there is not a word about this.

What is lacking? Workers? Skilled workers? Machinery?
Metal? Fuel? Anything else?

A âplanâ to obtain everything that is lacking must be
drawn up and published at once.

Lenin

26/IX.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The note to Krzhizhanovsky was written on p.Â 21 of the Bulletin
of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia, No.Â 5,
1920.

Krzhizhanovsky returned the Bulletin to Lenin the same day
with a note that the last numbers of the Bulletin were to be
issued in the very near future âin each of which a plan will be given
for small-scale (immediate) and large-scale electrification of
the main areasâ. =

Simultaneously with drawing up the
electrification programme, work had also been started on its
implementation. In particular, Krzhizhanovsky reported that in the
Central Industrial Region fairly good progress was being made
in the repair and socialisation of power stations (especially near
Moscow). It was necessary now, he wrote, âto link the operation
of these stations with the electrification of local agriculture on
a wide scale. In this regard, too, I can inform you of something
of Immediate practical interestâ.

Markings by Lenin occur also on p.Â 45 of the Bulletin, where
he side-lined, underscored and marked âN.B.â the sentence âthe
consumption of fuel by the railways will be 2Â 1/2â3 times as much
with steam traction as it would be with electric tractionâ. =

27. IX. 1920

Comrade Bryukhanov,

I am sending you two documents. Will you please read
them and return both to me:

1) About Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia.

We shall raise it in the Council of Defence on
29.Â IX.[1]

It is necessary to pay the most serious attention and to
try to meet their requests in the greatest possible degree.

2) About Tambov Gubernia.
 

Pay attention. Is the requisition quota of 11Â million poods
correct? Should it not be cut down?

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On OctoberÂ 1, 1920, the Council of Labour and Defence discussed
Leninâs report concerning the supply of coal and food to factories
of Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, belonging to the key group
of textile enterprises, and decided: =

âa) to endorse the agreement
of September 28 of this year between the Ivanovo-Voznesensk
Gubernia Food Committee and the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food; =

b) to take note of the statement of the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Food that 40 railway wagons of food have been sent from
Nizhni-Novgorodâ =

Comrade Krestinsky,

I think we should get a decision passed through the

to regularise it, that special agents of the Food
Commissariat are included as members of the Revolutionary
Military Councils of the fronts with the right to vote on questions
concerning the Food Commissariat.

Bogdanov has fooled you by disguising (verkleidet) an
old dispute and trying to shift it onto a different plane.
And you are taken in by it!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in reply to a note from Bukharin concerning V.Â I.
Nevskyâs article âDialectical Materialism and the Philosophy of
Dead Reactionâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 14, p.Â 21). In his note,
Bukharin pointed out that whereas previously Bogdanov had
recognised philosophy, he now abolished it and replaced it by â
tektologyâ or âuniversally organised scienceâ (as Bogdanov called
his book published in 1913). âThis formulation of the problem
is on a different plane from that of empirio-monism,â wrote
Bukharin. âIt can be disputed but it is necessary at least to
understand it. Nevsky, however, does not have this minimum
requirement.â

Secret
 1/X. 1920

Comrade Trotsky,

I enclose herewith information from Comrade
Sklyansky.[1]

It appears that the offensive against the Crimea has
been put off until 27/X!!!

Is there a decision of the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic on this???

The Commander-in-Chief boasted to me that by OctoberÂ 
10 (or 8) he would have everything ready for the offensive.
Does this mean he lied?

When was it decided to send Budyonny there? Why, even
without him forces three times as large were promised.

Finally, if the old plan is to be changed at all, is it not
enough to give 1Â division?

It turns out that all the calculations of the
Commander-in-Chief are not worth a damn and are changed weekly like
those of an ignoramus! Extremely dangerous vacillations!

Lenin

Comrade Trotsky,

I think that both Kamenev and Zinoviev should be sent
immediately to the Southern Front (and particularly to
the 1st Mounted Army), The aimâto inspect political work,
step it up and revitalise it, to accelerate the whole tempo.
Otherwise we shall not overcome the present mood.

4/X.

Comrade Bryukhanov,

1) The description relates to the period of the landing.
After it was liquidated the feeling and the state of affairs
changed completely as, incidentally, Lander told me
yesterday.

2) Lander also tells me that precisely now, after the
successful suppression of a number of revolts (connected
with the landing), grain collection (chiefly in the Kuban
area, where there is plenty of grain) has gone forward and
will go forward.

3) In Landerâs opinion, we can take there more than the
estimated requisition quota.

Draw Frumkinâs attention to this in a confidential letter
(not a telegram) to him. We must make the most of this
opportunity, not lose time (it will be worse later), and
apply our efforts to the Kuban.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes

Written by Lenin in connection with a report from the Terek
Regional Food Committee forwarded to him by Bryukhanov, Deputy
Peopleâs Commissar for Food. The report dealt with the difficult
conditions of work in the region as a result of Wrangelâs landing
in the Kuban area, with the unsatisfactory progress of food
procurements, and with the feeling among the population.

Comrade Rykov,

I think we should try bargaining, but concede in the
end (through the C.P.C.). Bargaining point: redemption
before expiry,
after 30Â years, at a heightened valuation of their
expenditure and labour.

Lenin

6/X.

You will concede a 50âyear period for the concession.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with Chicherinâs letter to Lenin of
October 5,1920, reporting Rykovâs talks with W.Â B. Vanderlip
concerning concessions in the Far East. Rykov was insisting on
shortening the term of the concessions and the right to buy them back
before their expiry, but Vanderlip would not agree to this.

6. X. 1920

Comrade Krestinsky,

Please raise the question in the Orgbureau. I think more
should be issued for the sick by way of special diet and a
decision adopted to improve it,Â 

by setting up a medical commission.

For scorbutics and other patients, I think, we should
at once allow purchases to be made on the free market,
subject to certain rules (perhaps also a commission and
with the co-operation of the state farms).



Regarding the protest of the Petrograd Central Committee,
I propose that votes be collected. I vote for:

1) mobilising Zinoviev;

2) cancelling general mobilisation of men.

Lenin

Orgbureau of the Central Committee

In the resolution of the Orgbureau of 7.X (No.Â 59,
pointÂ 3),Â 

sub-pointÂ b reprimands Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich for
impermissibly approaching me on this and âsimilar petty
questionsâ.

I request that this sub-point be cancelledÂ 
 

for when visiting the Kremlin hospital I personally
heard the doctors mention the shortage of food for the
patients and I myself asked the doctors to give me, through
Bonch-Bruyevich, their written proposalÂ 

on better feeding of the patients, etc.

Consequently, there was not even an âapproachâ to me
here on the part of Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich.

In code

Trotsky only

In view of the whole situation on the Polish front and
in connection with it, particularly following my night
conversation with Joffe, who energetically assures us of his
own, and our military expertâs, conviction that the Poles,
in point of fact, will not be able to prevent the armistice
(by threatening a break, Joffe compelled the Poles to
abandon the demand for a definite amount of gold. Joffe says:
the Poles are afraid of a break even more than we are),
the Politbureau of the Central Committee instructs the
military authorities to incur a certain amount of risk and
take some units from the South-Western Front for the
speediest and surest liquidation of Wrangel.

On behalf of the Politbureau,
 Lenin

Why now dwell on the differences between us (
perhaps possible ones), if it suffices to state (and prove) on
behalf of the Central Committee as a whole:

(1) proletarian culture=communismÂ 

(2) is carried out by the R.C.P.Â 

(3) the proletar.-class=R.C.P.=Soviet power.

We are all agreed on this, arenât we?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
By a decision of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on
OctoberÂ 11, 1920, N.Â I. Bukharin was directed to speak at a meeting

 Â  

of the Communist, group at the First All-Russia Congress of
Proletcult, which was held in Moscow from OctoberÂ 5 to 12, 1920.
The document published hero was Leninâs reply to a note from
Bukharin, who announced his refusal to speak at the Congress
on the grounds that disagreements between him and Lenin were
possible on certain questions of proletarian culture, for example,
on pointÂ 4 of Leninâs draft resolution âOn Proletarian Cultureâ
(see present edition, Vol.Â 31, pp.Â 316â17). The Communist group
at the First Congress of Proletcult was proposed to adopt an
organisational resolution subordinating the central and local Proletcult
organisations to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education.
This resolution was drawn up on the lines of Leninâs express
directives and was unanimously adopted by the Proletcult
Congress.

I propose that the Politbureau endorse all three of
Chicherinâs proposals.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In an effort to pit Turkey against Soviet Russia and to wreck
negotiations for establishing friendly relations, the Entente leaders
instigated Dashnak Armenia to attack Turkey. Dreaming of
creating a âGreat Armeniaâ which would include almost half of Asia
Minor, the Dashnak government began military operations against
Turkey on SeptemberÂ 24, 1920. In this war the Dashnak army
suffered defeat after defeat, while the advancing Turkish troops
laid waste to the land, chased out the civilian population and
organised massacres of Armenians. The war brought Armenia
to the brink of complete ruin and total extermination of the
population. At the beginning of October 1920, the C.C., C.P.(B.) of
Armenia issued a call to the workers and peasants to overthrow
the hated Dashnak yoke and establish Soviet power.

In connection with Orjonikidzeâs report of the probable
resignation of the Dashnak government of Armenia and of the
possibility of power passing to the Communists, Chicherin
proposed: =

1) to agree with the opinion of the C.C., C.P.(B.) of
Armenia and the Caucasian Bureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) on the
necessity of decisive action for establishing Soviet power in
Armenia, =

2) to afford Armenia political help in halting the further
advance of the Turks, and =

3) to support the new, Soviet government.

On OctoberÂ 14, 1920, the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
adopted Chicherinâs proposals.

Soviet power in Armenia was established on NovemberÂ 29,
1920, as the result of an armed uprising of the working people.
For Leninâs message of greetings to the Chairman of the
Revolutionary Military Committee of Armenia, see present edition, Vol.Â 
31, p.Â 437.

Gleb Maximilianovich,

I am sending Nikolayevâs reply.

Tomorrow Botin should arrive and I will send him to
you.

In view of Nikolayevâs doubts and suspicions, things
with Botin should be put on a precise and formal basis:
i.e., either you say, âit is not worth tryingâ. Then we shall
put an end to it all. Or you say, âit is worth while trying
againâ. Then Botin is delegated to you and you give him
an exact assignment, place him in exact working conditions,
under exact control. (Cannot he be made to write in detail,
in great detail, about the Tiflis experiment?)

Yours,
 Lenin

Members of the C.C.:

I emphatically disagree with this project. Changing
names is a harmful game.

In fulfilment of the decision of the Ninth Congress (I
enclose the text of the decision), it is necessary, in my
opinion, to set up a permanent inter-departmental commission
of the Council of Labour and Defence, under my
chairmanship (if the comrades do not object). That is quite
sufficient.

Lenin

15/X.

Please return to me with indications as to who has
read it.

Lenin

15/X.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin on the minutes of an inter-departmental
conference held on OctoberÂ 14, 1920. This conference considered it
necessary to transform the Supreme Economic Council into a
Peopleâs Commissariat for Industry and to setup an extraâ
departmental body under the Council of Labour and Defence for
co-ordinating economic plans for production, transport, supplies,
fuel, foreign trade, labour and currency distribution.

Enclosed with Leninâs note was the text of the decision of
the Ninth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) âOn Organisational Links
Between the Economic Commissariatsâ. This decision states: âThe
Congress instructs the Central Committee in the immediate future
to work out a system of organisational links between the Supreme
Economic Council and other Commissariats (the Peopleâs
Commissariats for Food, Railways, Agriculture) that are directly linked
with the economy in their daily work, with the aim of ensuring
complete unity in carrying out the economic plan endorsed by
the Party Congress.â =

On the document are the following notes
and signatures of those members of the Central Committee who
read Leninâs note: =

âRead. N.Â Krestinskyâ, =

âRead and agree
with Lenin. L.Â Serebryakovâ, =

âAgree with Comrade Leninâs
proposal. F.Â Dzerzhinskyâ, =

âRead, agree with Vladimir Ilyich.
A.Â Andreyevâ. =

In the hand of the secretary is written: =

âComrade
Tomsky has read it. Has telephoned that he fully agrees with
Comrade Lenin.â =

Comrade Sklyansky,

Give the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic
an instruction or, rather, a definite order to achieve rapid
and complete liquidation. Let me know what measures have
been taken.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Defence

15/X.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The note to Sklyansky was written on a telegram from A.Â G.
Schlichter, Chairman of the Tambov Gubernia Executive Committee
and Chairman of the Gubernia Military Council, who requested
that reinforcements be sent to the units of the Red Army
operating against bandit groups in Tambov Gubernia.

On OctoberÂ 19, Lenin wrote a note to V.Â S. Kornev, Commander
of the Forces of Internal Security, on the need for the speediest

 Â  

liquidation of the counter-revolutionary outbreak in Tambov
Gubernia, and he asked to be informed what measures were being
taken (see present volume, DocumentÂ 727). On OctoberÂ 23 a report
was received from Kornev on the measures taken to put down
the revolt in Tambov Gubernia.

Comrade Sereda,

Please give me your
comments.[1]

It is essential, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to
prepare a plan for a tractor campaign.

1) Purchase abroadÂ 

2) Production in RussiaÂ 

3) Techniciansâ
     workers, etc.

Be sure to let me know in a day or so, when you will
present a preliminary memorandum. (Should not a
conference he convened at once?)

Urgent

Comrade Dzerzhinsky

Bandits have seized the Boldyrev (Rasskazovo) factories
(Tambov Gubernia).

It is an absolute scandal.

I propose that the Chekists (and the Gubernia Executive
Committee people) of Tambov Gubernia who were caught
off their guardÂ 

1) be court-martialled,Â 

2) that Kornev be severely reprimanded,Â 

3) that extremely energetic people be sent there at once,Â 

4) that a severe trimming and instructions be given by
telegraph.

Comrades Lezhava and M.Â N. Pokrovsky

I insist that this matter be speeded up to the utmost and
a draft decision be submitted to the C.P.C. on Tuesday
(26.X):

1) to decide on the sale of these articles abroad as quickly
as possible;

2) to require from the Peopleâs Commissariat for
Education an official reply before Tuesday, 26/X, as to whether
they have any objection (it is said they have already
picked out articles for our museums: I agree to let them
have only the strictly necessary minimum);

3) to send abroad at once a special commission of experts+
traders, promising them a good bonus for a speedy and
profitable sale;
 

4) as I find the work excessively slow (8 out of
33[1]

),

I
consider it absolutely necessary to increase the personnel of
the commission of experts (Gorky suggests up to 200 persons)
and to give them rations on condition that the work is
completed
quickly.[2]

Lenin

21/X.
 

Notes
 

[1]
See NoteÂ 358.âEd.
 



[2]
On October 26, 1920, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
discussed a draft decision on the sale abroad of antiques and endorsed
the following decision: =

â1) To direct the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Foreign Trade to arrange for the collection of antiques selected
by the Petrograd Commission of Experts and to fix a bonus for
their most rapid and profitable sale abroad. =

2) The question of the
quantity and standard of rations for the Commission of Experts
to be referred to the Workersâ Food Supply Commission for
decision. If agreement with Comrade Lezhava is not reached, the
matter to be submitted to the Council of Peopleâs Commissars. =

3) To instruct the Peopleâs Commissariat for Foreign Trade to
examine urgently the question of setting up a similar commission
in Moscow and, if this is found advisable, to organise it.â =

(
Collected Works, Fifth Ed., Vol.Â 51, p.Â 462.)

The Commission of Experts recommended sending the well-known
antique expert, M.Â M. Savostin, and the artist I.Â N. Rakitsky, a
member of the Commission, to European markets for antiquesâin
Paris, London, Florence and Romeâfor establishing connections
with the leading antique dealers in the West, ascertaining
precise prices of antiques, and arranging auctions.

Comrade Bryukhanov

The Stavropol peasants (who have brought grain for the
children) complain that they are not getting from the
co-operativesÂ 

wheel-grease (the stores have it),Â 

matchesÂ 

and other goods.

The herrings were allowed to go bad, but they were not
given out.

There is terrible discontent. The Gubernia Food
Commissar says: nothing will be given until the whole requisition
quota is fulfilled.

They insist on the need for goods to be issued
immediately.

They say that the quota of 27 million poods is excessive,
seed corn is being taken, and there is bound to be
under-sowing.

Stavropol Guberniaâaverage harvest (27).

Kubanâbetter than Stavropol (37 million poods).

Please examine it urgently, especially the first point,
and give me your opinion not later than tomorrow.

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Address: Kazan (railway station), goods station, truck
No.Â 506955 on the Krivoi track, Petrov from the
Gubernia Party Committee.

Please go into this matter as quickly as possible. It is
evident from the enclosed that the instruction of the Food
Commissariat (of the centre) puts these products at the
disposal of the Commission for Improving Scientistsâ
Living Conditions. Hence, without the consent of the centre,
Petrograd has no right to requisition them or take them
into account!

Lenin

21/X.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this note to the Narrow Council of Peopleâs
Commissars on a letter from Maxim Gorky. In view of the fact that the
Petrograd Commune was proposing to requisition the products which
had been supplied by permission of the Peopleâs Commissariat
for Food to the Petrograd Commission for Improving Scientistsâ
Living Conditions, Maxim Gorky, Chairman of the Commission,
asked the Council of Peopleâs Commissars to pass a decision
stating: âProducts supplied by gubernia food committees, with the
permission of the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food, to the
Petrograd Commission for Improving Scientistsâ Living Conditions
are not to be requisitioned by the Petrograd Commune nor to
be counted by the latter as part of the ration quota endorsed
by the Council of Peopleâs Commissars, for Petrograd scientists.â

Written in connection with a secret agreement between the
bourgeois Latvian Government and agents of Wrangel for a joint
attack against Soviet Russia. On SeptemberÂ 26, 1920, when Count
von Palen, a well-known agent of Wrangelâs, was crossing the
German frontier, letters were taken from him addressed to
Savinkov, Wrangelâs agent in Warsaw. These letters reported that a
secret meeting had taken place in Riga between a representative
of Savinkov and representatives of the Latvian Government and
Supreme Command of the Latvian army, at which agreement was
reached on joint action with Wrangel aimed at overthrowing the
Soviet Government and re-establishing a single indivisible
Russia, in return for which Wrangel promised independence for
Poland and Latvia. The confiscated letters also reported that
soldiers for Wrangelâs army were being recruited in Latvia, that a
recruiting office receiving financial support from Savinkov was
operating almost openly in Riga and transporting soldiers on
Latvian steamships.

Gubernia) in regard to a case of flagrant Party and Soviet
abuses.

I consider their approach to me quite in order and called
for by the circumstances of the case and ask to be informed
what general procedure you have established for members
of uyezd Party organisations to approach Moscow in
general and the C.C., R.C.P. in particular.

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 27, 1920, Lenin received a delegation from a Party
Conference of Alexandrov Uyezd (Vladimir Gubernia),
consisting of Comrades Ratnikov, Rybakov, Romanov and Glazunov,
who informed him of abuses at the Troitsk Equipment Works
and of the difficulty Party members had bringing the matter to
the attention of the centre and obtaining its speedy investigation.
The letter to the Vladimir Gubernia Party Committee was the
result of Leninâs conversation with this delegation.

Comrades Dzerzhinsky, Muranov, Preobrazhensky, and
 others

I earnestly request you to receive personally Comrades
Ratnikov, Rybakov, Romanov and Glazunov from the uyezd
Party conference (Alexandrov Uyezd, Vladimir Gubernia)
about a case of flagrant, exceedingly glaring abuses (
Soviet and Party) at the Troitsk Equipment Works, and
particularly about the difficulties experienced by Party members
in taking the case to the centre and getting it speedily
examined if even through Party channels. Apparentlyâthis

  Â  

is my impressionâthere is something wrong in the Gubernia
Party Committee as well. I enclose a copy of the decision
of the Orgbureau.

With communist greetings,
 V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)

28. X. 1920

1) Comrade Rykov (or, if he has not yet recovered,
Comrade Milyutin)Â 

2) and Comrade I.Â I. Radchenko, Chief Peat Committee

Copies to:


3) R.Â E. Klasson (to be found through
 Radchenko)

4) Krzhizhanovsky, Chairman of the State
Commission for the Electrification of Russia

5) Sklyansky (Â§Â 4) and Trotsky

6) Lezhava and Lomonosov

7) the Cinema Department

8) Sosnovsky

9) Shatunovsky (Chief Transport Commission).

On 27.Â X. 1920, a film before a large Party audience
showed the working of a new hydraulic pump (of
engineer R.Â E. Klasson) which mechanises the extraction
of peat, as compared with the old method.

In this connection, an exchange of opinions took place
between engineer Klasson, Comrades Radchenko and
Morozovârepresentatives of the Chief Peat Committee, Comrade
Shatunovsky (from the Chief Transport Commission), and
myself.

This exchange of opinions revealed that the heads of
the Chief Peat Committee fully agree with the inventor
on the great importance of this invention. In all the work
for restoring the national economy of the R.S.F.S.R. and
for the countryâs electrification, mechanisation of peat

  Â  

extraction makes it possible to go ahead immeasurably more
rapidly and firmly and on a broader front. It is therefore
essential immediately to take a number of measures on
a national scale to develop this work.

Please discuss this question immediately and give me
without delay your comments (corrections, additions,
counter-plans, and so on) on the following proposals arising from
yesterdayâs preliminary exchange of opinions.

1. To regard work on applying the hydraulic method of
peat extraction as of prime state importance and therefore
especially urgent. To pass a decision to this effect through
the Council of Peopleâs Commissars on Saturday, 30/X.

2. To instruct all chief committees (and other bodies),
on whose support the successful work of the Commission (or
committee?) for Hydraulic Peat Extraction (under the Chief
Peat Committee) mainly depends, to delegate their
representatives (preferably Communists or, in any case, people
known to be conscientious and particularly energetic) to take
a permanent part in this commission. To make them
responsible, in particular,
for the speediest fulfilment, without any
procrastination, of the orders and requests of this
commission. To give the Council of Peopleâs Commissars the
names and addresses of these representatives.

3. The same in regard to some of the most important
factories involved. List of these factories to be drawn up.

4. To instruct the Naval Department to have its own
representative on the commission, one fully acquainted with
the stocks of materials and technical facilities of this
department.

5. To issue Red Army rations to the group of people on
whose work the rapid and complete success of the matter
directly depends, increasing at the same time their
remuneration so as to enable them to devote themselves wholly
and completely to their work. To instruct the
Commission for Hydraulic Peat Extraction to send immediately
to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Food and the All-Russia
Central Council of Trade Unions a list (exact) of these
people, indicating standards of remuneration, bonuses, etc.

6. To discuss immediately with the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Foreign Trade what orders should be placed at
once with Swedish and German factories (perhaps engaging

  Â  

there one or several prominent chemists) so that by the
summer of 1921 we can receive what is necessary for the
speediest and widest application of the hydraulic method. In
particular, to make use of Comrade Lomonosov who is due
to leave for Sweden and Germany within the next few days.

7. To instruct the Cinema Department (of the Peopleâs
Commissariat for Education?) to arrange for the film of
the hydraulic method to be shown on a wide scale (
particularly in Petrograd, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Moscow and
peat-extraction localities) with the simultaneous reading,
without fail, of a brief and popular leaflet (ask Comrade
Sosnovsky to edit it) explaining the gigantic importance of
mechanising peat extraction and of electrification.

8. I fix the first report of the Commission for the
Hydraulic Method of Peat Extraction to the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars for 30.Â X.
1920.[1]

V.Â Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. Comrade Rykov, should not the question be raised
of using more of the materials and technical facilities of the
Naval Department for the needs of the production of the
means of production? Why should we want new
battleships and the like? Arenât they out of place just now? 
Shatunovsky (take notice of him, he is a devoted and valuable
man; a worker, studied mathematics abroad) says (according
to Sosnovsky) that in the Naval Department Trotsky
discovered something like a million poods of first-grade steel (for
battleships) and took it for the Chief Transport Commission.
Check this, think it over, perhaps we shall put it before
the Council of Defence or the Council of Peopleâs
Commissars.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On OctoberÂ 30, 1920, following a report by Lenin and Milyutin,
the Council of Peopleâs Commissars adopted a decision âOn the
Hydraulic Method of Peat Extractionâ. Hydraulic peat work,
wherever carried out, was acknowledged to be especially urgent
and of extremely great state importance. The Board of the
Supreme Economic Council was instructed to organise under the
Chief Peat Committee a Department for Hydraulic Peat
Extraction (Gidrotorf), with R.Â E. Klasson as responsible director.
Concrete measures were endorsed for developing work on hydraulic
peat extraction.

Frunze, Commander of the Southern Front
 Copy to Trotsky

In reply to your No.Â 001/IIIII. I am indignant at your
optimistic tone, when you yourself report that there is only
one chance in a hundred that the main task, set long ago, will
be successful. If things are so outrageously bad, I ask you
to discuss measures of the utmost urgency for bringing up
heavy artillery, for constructing lines for its transport, for
getting sappers, and so on.

The document is the reply to a telegram from Frunze sent to Lenin
on OctoberÂ 26, 1920, from Apostolovo station, in which Frunze
reported: âI have just given the final order for a general offensive.

 Â  

The decisive days will be OctoberÂ 30 and 31 and NovemberÂ 1. I have
no doubt about the rout of the enemyâs main forces. They will
not succeed in withdrawing beyond the isthmuses by the time
we strike. I consider that the chance of an immediate capture of
the isthmuses is not more than one in a hundred.â (M.Â V. Frunze

At its sitting on OctoberÂ 4, the Council of Peopleâs Commissars
decided to ask the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western
Front to vacate the university premises in Smolensk, and direct the
Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic to enforce this
decision by telegraph. In pursuance of the decision of the Council of
Peopleâs Commissars, Comrade Sklyansky transmitted this
instruction to the Revolutionary Military Council for fulfilment.
Nevertheless, up to now the university premises have not been vacated by
the Western Front Headquarters. In view of the extreme need of the
university (of a special faculty) for premises, I am submitting a
complaint to you on account of the non-fulfilment of the decision of the
Council of Peopleâs Commissars and ask for categorical orders to be
Issued to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front.

Carry out without delay. Report on fulfilment and I
will take up the question of non-compliance and
