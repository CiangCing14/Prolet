LCW: 11: Preface by Progress Publishers







Lenin
      Collected Works: Volume 11: Preface by Progress Publishers




Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 11
Preface by Progress Publishers


    Volume 11 contains works written by V. I. Lenin in the period from
    June 1906 to January 1907. The majority of them are devoted to
    questions connected with the activities of the Social-Democratic
    Group in the First State Duma, the dissolution of the Duma and the
    beginning of the election campaign for the Second Duma.
  

    The articles “Lessons of the Moscow Uprising”,
    “Hands Off!"  and “Guerrilla Warfare” are devoted
    to problems of the organisation and tactics of an armed uprising.
  

    In the articles “The Declaration of Our Group in the
    Duma”, “Who Is for Alliances with the Cadets?",
    “Yes-Men of the Cadets”, “The Political Crisis and
    the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics”, “The Dissolution
    of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat”, Lenin exposes
    the Menshevik tactics of support for a Cadet Duma and of the slogan
    of a Duma Cabinet composed of Cadets, gives a political appraisal of
    the dissolution of the First Duma and formulates the tasks of the
    Party in this period.
  

    The writings “The Social-Democrats and Electoral
    Agreements”, “A Dissenting Opinion”, recorded a
    the November All-Russian Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., “Draf
    Election Address”, “Blocs with the Cadets”,
    “The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections”,
    "'When You Hear the Judgement of a Fool'.... (From the Notes of
    a Social-Democratic Publicist)", are devoted to questions concerning
    the election campaign for the Second Duma.
  

    The articles “An Attempt at a Classification of the Political
    Parties of Russia”, “Socialist-Revolutionary
    Mensheviks” and “Philistinism in Revolutionary
    Circles” are devoted to a class analysis of the Russian
    political parties.
  


    This edition of Lenin's Collected Works includes for the
    first time the leaflet “Whom to Elect to the State
    Duma”, the note on the “Union of the Bund with the
    Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party” and the article
    “The Working-Class Party's Tasks and the Peasantry”,
    which expounds the Bolsheviks' main slogan in the election campaign,
    for complete independence of the class policy of the proletariat and
    the impermissibility of blocs with the Cadets.

The political situation is becoming clear with amazing
speed.


Some months ago it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the State
Duma would meet or what it would be like. A few weeks ago it was still unclear,
to the broad mass of the people at least, in what field and in what form the
next stage of the struggle for freedom would develop. The simple-minded
peasants believed in the Duma; they could not admit of the idea that the
eloquent requests and statements of all the representatives of the people would
have no result. The bourgeois liberals, who were trying to induce the government
to make concessions out of “good will”, believed in the
Duma. It would be no exaggeration to say that in a few days their faith was
shattered before our eyes, the faith of the mass of the people, all of whose
interests nurtured and strengthened this belief. They believed because they
wanted to believe, they believed be cause the immediate political future was
still dark, they believed because the political twilight left room for every
kind of ambiguity, wavering and depression.


Now everything has again become clear. The foresight of people who were thought
to be eccentric pessimists in the period of the elections to the Duma and during
the first days of the Duma has been vindicated. The Duma has been sitting only
five or six weeks and already people who have been whole-heartedly endeavouring
to devise, and develop activities in the Duma and around the Duma are frankly
and honestly admitting the great fact: “How tired the people are of
waiting.”

 

    For decades they did not become tired of waiting, but now they have become tired
    after a few weeks; they were not tired of waiting while they were asleep
    or vegetating, while the external circumstances of their lives
    contained nothing directly changing their existence beyond recognition,
    their mood, their consciousness, their will. They have become tired of
    waiting after a few weeks, now that the thirst for action has awakened in
    them with incredible rapidity, and the most eloquent and sympathetic words,
    even from such a lofty platform as the Duma, have begun to seem dreary,
    boring and uninteresting. The workers have become tired of waiting—the
    wave of strikes has begun to mount higher and higher. The peasants have
    become tired of waiting; no persecutions and tortures, exceeding the
    horrors of the medieval Inquisition, can stop their struggle for the land, for
    freedom. The sailors in Kronstadt and Sevastopol have become tired of
    waiting, as well as the infantrymen in Kursk, Poltava, Tula and Moscow, the
    guardsmen in Krasnoye Selo, and even the Cossacks. All now see where and how
    a new great struggle is flaring up, all realise its inevitability, all sense
    the absolute need for the actions of the proletariat and peasantry to be
    staunch, stead fast and well-prepared, and that these actions should be
    simultaneous and co-ordinated. They feel that it is necessary to wait for
    this.... We are on the eve of great historical events, we are on the eve of
    the second great stage of the Russian revolution. The Social-Democrats, who
    consciously express the class struggle of the proletariat, will stand at
    their posts to a man, and will perform their duty to the end.

It is quite evident that we are now passing through one of the most important
periods of the revolution. Signs of a revival of the broad, mass movement
against the old order have been visible for a long time. Now this revival is
reaching its climax. The Duma elections and the first week of the sessions and
activities of the opposition Duma acted as a “farthing dip” which
ignited the conflagration throughout the country. The quantity of inflammatory
material was still so vast, and the atmosphere was still so
“heated”, that no precautionary measures could be of any avail.


And now it is becoming absolutely obvious to everyone that the conflagration has
really spread throughout the country. The rising has spread to quite new strata,
both of the proletariat—including even those who only six months ago
provided recruits for the Black Hundreds—and, particularly, of the
peasantry. The army, which is connected with the most backward sections of the
peasantry, and whose ranks are carefully combed so as to get rid of, destroy and
suppress all that is fresh and virile—even the army has proved to be
almost entirely engulfed in the flames. News of “revolts” and
outbreaks among the armed forces is flying in from all sides, like sparks from a
great fire.


Newspaper reporters who have some connection with the bureaucracy report that
the Minister of War has uttered a warning against dissolving the Duma, for in
that case he could not rely upon the army.


Under these circumstances, it is no wonder the government is wavering. It is
true nevertheless that, although wavering, the government is preparing very
definitely to

    

crush the revolution by bloodshed. Provocation is increasing. A war to the
      death has been declared on the free press. The Left newspapers “are
      being confiscated in defiance of all laws”. Kronstadt is inundated
      with special troops. The pogrom in Belostok marked the opening of
      counter-revolutionary operations, and armed operations at that. The
      government is wavering; warning voices are heard from its ranks, voices
      recommending a deal with the Cadets. But this wavering, this “pause
      for reflection”, is not causing the government for a moment to
      forget the old, customary, and well-tried policy of naked violence.


Lassalle said that reactionaries are business-like people. Our reactionaries are
proving that this is true. They are reflecting, weighing things up, wavering,
in doubt as to whether to start a general offensive on the new line (i.e., by
dissolving the Duma) at once, or not. But they are preparing for an
offensive, and are not pausing in this “business” for a single
moment. From the point of view of robbers around whose necks the noose is being
drawn ever tighter, they are reasoning correctly. Shall we yield to the Cadets,
who promise a “strong government”, or take reprisals by fire and
sword? Their decision today is: we need be in no hurry to adopt the first
alternative, that can be done at any time in the future; but in any
case we must prepare to adopt the second alternative. No doubt many of them
also reason in the following way: let us first try the second alternative and
choose the most opportune moment for it. We can yield to the Cadets at the last
moment, when we are absolutely convinced that it is impossible to restore
everything by whole sale bloodshed!


As robbers, they are reasoning quite correctly. Obviously, they will not
surrender without a desperate and ruthless fight. Meanwhile, of course, they are
preparing a line of retreat—in case things turn out badly—in the
shape of a deal with the Cadets, an alliance with them on the platform of the
“strong government” about which Mr. Struve so opportunely reminds
them. The reactionaries are preparing for a stern and decisive battle, and they
regard a deal with the Cadets as a minor result of an unsuccessful battle.


The proletariat must weigh up the tasks of the revolution soberly and
squarely. As regards handling big problems, it

    

is no less “business-like” than the reactionaries. It must
concentrate all its attention, all its cares and all its efforts on the decisive
battle inevitable tomorrow or the day after— and regard a deal between the
government and the Cadets as a by-product of one of the possible stages of the
revolution. The proletariat has nothing to fear from such a deal; both the
Trepovs and the moderate liberals will come to grief over it. But the
proletariat must not under any circumstances, directly or indirectly, support
such a deal, support the demand for a responsible Cabinet representing the
majority in the Duma. We need not now prevent this deal; but we shall
not support it. We shall pursue our own road. We shall continue to be
the party of the advanced class, which will not issue to the masses
a single ambiguous slogan, which will not, directly or indirectly, have
any truck whatever with any of the sordid dealings of the bourgeoisie, and which
will be able to protect the interests of the revolution under all
circumstances, whatever the outcome of the struggle.


A compromise between the government and the Duma is by no means impossible as
one of the specific episodes of the revolution. The Social-Democrats
must neither advocate, support nor “shatter” such a compromise at
the present time. They must concentrate all their attention, and the attention
of the masses, on the main and essential thing and not on secondary and side
issues. They will take the utmost advantage of every compromise between the
bourgeoisie and the old regime, of all the wavering above. But they will
consistently warn the working class and the peasantry against the
“friendship” of the Cadets. To the wavering above they must oppose
invincible determination below and, not yielding to provocation, must firmly and
persistently gather their forces for the decisive moment.

The Social-Democratic Group in the State Duma is on the eve of taking
action. Undoubtedly, this Group can now render the cause of the working-class
movement and of the revolution a great service by its bold and consistent
utterance, by proclaiming with unmistakable clarity the demands and slogans of
consistent democracy and of the proletarian class
struggle for socialism. Now that the question of Social-Democratic action in the
Duma has been decided by the Unity Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party, there can be no two opinions among Social-Democrats about
this. And we think that our Caucasian comrades were quite right to sign the
notorious “solemn pledge” of the members of the State
Duma[2]

and to state in the press in this connection that “we are signing
this in order to be able to fulfil the mission with which the people have
entrust ed us, and we emphasise that the only political obligations we recognise
are obligations to the people”.


The more important the actions of our representatives in the Slate Duma become
for the Party, the more carefully must we weigh the principles of
Social-Democratic tactics at the present time. It must be admitted that the
course of political events, which has become exceptionally rapid in the past few
weeks, throws considerable light on questions which only yesterday were still
unclear; it helps us clearly and precisely to define our position, and removes
many of the disagreements between the Right and Left wings of our Party.


In this connection we are particularly pleased to emphasise the arguments of
former Menshevik comrades in to day’s issue of Kuryer.[3]

True, the
leading article, “Duma

    

’Laws’", starts with a somewhat ambiguous protest against describing the
drafting of laws for the Duma as useless chatter; but it turns out that the
comrades had good reason for putting the word “laws” in inverted
commas. They support— and they are a thousand times right in doing
so—the drafting of laws that will not be laws in the ordinary sense, but
“declarations” that “proclaim the right of the people to
freedom”, “proclaim the abolition of the old barriers”.


Perhaps it would be more correct to call such “laws”, not laws, but
appeals to the people. But it would be unreasonable to stress disagreements on
terminology when agreement prevails on the main issue. And on this, agreement
is actually complete. “It is absolutely absurd and harmful,”
writes Kuryer, “to submit to the Duma Bills carefully drawn up in
minutest detail, with scores and hundreds of paragraphs, remarks and so
forth” (all italics ours). Quite so. Such activities, customarily called
“constructive” are certainly harmful. They are harmful
“because instead of presenting striking contrasts that everyone can see,
such Bills hopelessly confuse the mind of the public with a welter of
clauses and paragraphs”.


This is quite true. The mind of the public is indeed hopelessly
confused with the welter of “constructive” legislative
project-mongering. This project-mongering obscures, blunts and corrupts the mind
of the public, for “in any case, these laws will never be put into
operation. Before that can be done, power must be wrested from the
hands of those who now hold it. And this power can be wrested from those hands
only by a popular movement that will put in the place of the Duma
itself a far more powerful and democratic institution, which will not
be obliged to reckon with the ’laws’ drawn up by the Duma."

This statement
shifting public attention to the absolute necessity of wresting power and of
establishing a “far more powerful” institution that will not reckon
with the laws drawn up by the Cadet Duma, very correctly appraises the
fundamental tasks of the revolutionary proletariat and the requirements of the
present situation.


In this same article, the comrades of Kuryer brilliantly
trounce the Cadets for failing to understand these tasks. The Cadets draft their
Bills “like real legislators, forgetting

    

that they have not even a farthing’s worth of real legislative
    power”. “They draft their ’Bills’ as if the courts tomorrow will
    have to try citizens according to the new Cadet laws.”


Kuryer tells the Cadets that their position is disgraceful. There is
only one conclusion to be drawn from this thrice correct admonition, and that
conclusion suggests itself. Revolutionary Social-Democrats cannot and must not
sup port the demand for the appointment of a responsible Cabinet representing
the majority in the Duma! For such a Cabinet will be a Cadet Cabinet, and on
the very morrow of its appointment it will have to draw up penalties
for abuses of freedom. At the present time, when the Star Chamber[4]

is still the power in the land, such a Cabinet can only serve as a liberal screen
for the old regime. At the present time, such a Cabinet would only serve as a
new cloak to conceal these same pogrom-mongers for a time! We should, of course,
very soon expose this disguise. We shall take the utmost advantage of the new
situation when it arises, when not only the old regime, but the Cadets, too, are
entangled in this new cloak and are overwhelmed by the tide. But we, the party
of the proletariat, must not, directly or indirectly, avowedly or tacitly,
assume the slightest responsibility for this attempt to disguise the old
regime. We must not issue to the masses the slogan of supporting the demand for
the formation of a responsible Cabinet representing the majority in the
Duma. Whatever our intentions, owing to the objective conditions of the present
political situation such a slogan will inevitably mean that the party of the
proletariat will have to bear part of the responsibility for this disguise, for
this deal between the bourgeoisie and the old regime. Such a slogan will
indirectly imply approval of the Cadet “Bills” that are so
excellently criticised in Kuryer; for indeed it cannot be denied that
there is a connection between the Cadets’ plan to punish abuses of freedom and
their plan to obtain, in the shape of a Cabinet, a modicum of power for applying
these penalties; to obtain a modicum of power from the old regime,
for the strengthening of the old regime, by means of a deal
with the old regime, in the shape of a screen shielding it from the onslaught of
the people against it.

 

The workers’ party needs no such slogan. It will be able to carry on all its
propaganda and agitation activities among the masses and build up wide
organisations far better, far more integrally, systematically and boldly without
such a slogan, by countering the effrontery of the pogrom-mongers and the
“Bills” of the Cadets by means of our Social-Democratic
“decrees”, “proclamations” and appeals to the people
through the medium of the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma (and, under
certain conditions, of the Trudoviks acting in conjunction with it), and lastly,
by issuing those “calls to the people to form a popular militia, which
alone will be capable of protecting their lives and honour”—the calls that
we recommended in Vperyod,[5]

No. 9,[1]

which are recommended by Volkszeitung,[6]

the organ of the Bund, and of which Kuryer quite rightly approves.


Let us have unity, comrades! The unity of the political actions of the
proletariat is growing with irresistible force, under the pressure of the whole
revolutionary atmosphere. Let us not hinder this unity by introducing
unnecessary and controversial slogans into our tactics. Let us take advantage of
the present opportunity to secure complete agreement among all Social-Democrats
at this moment, which will perhaps prove to be a supreme moment in the great
Russian revolution!

The “solemn pledge” included in Article 13 of the Statute
on the Duma had to be signed by all members of the State Duma. It contained an
undertaking on the part of the deputies to fulfil the obligations imposed on
them while “remaining faithful” to the tsar. The Caucasian
Social-Democratic deputies to the First State Duma, after signing the
“solemn pledge”, published in the press the statement quoted by
V. I. Lenin. (See Kuryer, No. 20, June
8 (21), 1906.)

The “Star Chamber” was the name given to the special high

In the period 1905-07 in Russia the name “Star Chamber” was applied

The speech delivered by Comrade Ramishvili, the Social-Democratic Deputy in the
State Duma, contains some very true observations that correctly define
Social-Democratic tactics. The speaker not only denounced the government of
pogrom-mongers with the vigour of a genuine representative of the proletariat,
he not only branded the representatives of the government as “enemies of
the people”—and the new attempt of the Cadet Chairman of the Duma to
restrict freedom of speech evoked the legitimate protest of the extreme
Left—but in addition, in concluding his speech, he raised the general
question of the relation between the Duma and the people.


This is what the Social-Democratic Deputy said on this question:



“I conclude by stating that we are backed by the people. Outside something
is going on that is entirely different from what we are doing here in this
Chamber. The atmosphere outside is entirely different. Here it is much milder;
here a more peaceful mood prevails. In a month from now, perhaps,
we ourselves will be deciding our affairs....

The facts of life speak
much more loudly about what is going on around us than we do here. I
say that we are standing between the government and the people. The Duma is a
dangerous spot. To go to the Left or to the Bight means
conciliation with someone, or a rupture with someone....

You must not
forget that the people themselves will obtain what the Duma cannot
obtain owing to its wavering and lack of determination. I say that the
people are in a different mood from that which prevails here....”



We have italicised the particularly important passages in this speech. The
speaker quite rightly said that the facts of life speak much more
loudly than the Duma does; that the atmosphere outside is not as
“peaceful”, and that “the
    

people are in a different mood”. That is undoubtedly true. And the
deduction that follows from this truth is that those who say that the people
must support the Duma are wrong. The people are already ahead of the Duma, are
speaking louder, are less peacefully inclined, are fighting more
vigorously. Hence, the only correct definition of the task of the
Social-Democrats is: to explain to the widest possible mass of the people that
the Duma only timidly and inadequately expresses the demands of the
people. Only such a formulation of Social-Democratic tactics relieves
the party of the proletariat of responsibility for the instability of the
Cadets. Only such a formulation, which fully allows for the degree of
development of the political consciousness, determination and preparedness of
the peasant masses, adequately conforms to the great tasks of the present
moment, a moment concerning which the elected representatives of the
Social-Democratic proletariat bluntly say: “In a month from now, perhaps, we
ourselves will be deciding our affairs.” To be able to decide them,
however, we must at once completely dissociate ourselves from all either
dishonest or unwise attempts to seek a “peaceful” solution.


Comrade Ramishvili was quite right when he declared from the rostrum of the
Duma: “The Duma is a dangerous spot.” Why? Because it displays
“wavering and lack of determination”. And at a time when, in a
month from now, perhaps, the people themselves will have to decide their
affairs, wavering and lack of determination is positively criminal. Whoever
displays these qualities at such a time will inevitably find himself in
an extremely false position, no matter how sincere his intentions may have
been. It does not depend on our will that at such a moment all the economic and
political conditions surrounding us inevitably give rise to a decisive struggle
between the people and the old regime. Whoever wavers in face of this impending
struggle will, indeed, have to choose between the alternative of
“conciliation with someone or a rupture with someone”. This
is exactly the position that the Cadets are in. The liberal bourgeoisie is
reaping what it has been sowing for years by its double-faced and vacillating
policy, and by its desertions from revolution to
counter-revolution. Conciliation with the old regime means a rupture with the
fighting people.

    

A rupture with the old regime is what would be essential for conciliation with
      the fighting people.


The majority in the Duma has been doing everything to make its position clear in
this inexorable choice. Every step this Cadet, and sometimes even worse than
Cadet, majority takes in its policy is in preparation for a rupture with the
fighting people, preparation for conciliation with the old regime. These steps
are small ones, we shall be told. But they are real steps in real politics, we
shall reply. These steps conform to all the fundamental class interests of the
liberal bourgeoisie. And the

Cadets’ 

demand for a Duma Cabinet
appointed by the old regime bears precisely this “peaceful”
character.


We shall never tire of repeating that it would be stupid and harmful for the
workers’ party to support this demand. Stupid, because the only thing that is
really weakening the old regime is the struggle of the people, who are going
further than the timid Duma. Harmful, because it will sow deception and confusion
in the minds of the people. Yesterday we pointed out that the comrades of
Kuryer were right in stating that the Bills drafted by the Cadets were
stupid and

       harmful.[1]

Today it is to be regretted that these same comrades are
advocating support for a Duma Cabinet, that is to say, a Cabinet that will carry
through these stupid and harmful Bills!


Perhaps we shall examine these vacillations of Kuryer in greater detail
another time. For the time being, it will be sufficient to point to them; the
very fact that there is wavering at an important moment like the present shows
that the position of the waverers is extremely precarious.

It is common knowledge that already in its programme the
Social-Democratic Party expressed the unshakable conviction that really to
satisfy the urgent needs of the mass of the people all power must be in the
hands of the people. If the mass of the people do not have the
entire state power in their hands, if any organ of power not elected by
the people, not liable to dismissal, and not entirely dependent on the people,
is allowed to remain, it will be impossible really to satisfy the
urgent and universally admitted needs of the people.


The Social-Democratic Party has always exerted every effort to spread this
indisputable truth among the proletariat and among the whole people. The real,
that is, the mass struggle for freedom has always passed, and always will pass,
through the most varied and often unexpected stages. It cannot be otherwise
owing to the enormous difficulties of the struggle, the complexity of its tasks
and the changes taking place in the ranks of the fighters. In guiding the
proletarian struggle at every stage in its development and under all
circumstances, the Social-Democratic Party, as the conscious champion of the
aspirations of the working class, must constantly bear in mind the general and
fundamental interests of this struggle as a whole. Social-Democracy teaches us
not to forget the general interests of the working class for the sake of
particular interests; not to allow the specific features of the individual
stages of the struggle to cause us to forget the fundamental aims of the
struggle as a whole.

 

This is how the revolutionary Social-Democrats have always conceived their tasks
      in the present Russian revolution; and this conception alone is in
      accordance with the position and tasks of the proletariat as the advanced
      class. On the other hand, in conformity with the specific class interests
      of the bourgeoisie, the liberal bourgeoisie has always formulated its
      tasks in the struggle for political freedom quite differently. The
      bourgeoisie needs political freedom, but it is afraid to allow the people
      to have full power, because the proletariat, developed and united in the
      course of the struggle, would use this power of the people against the
      bourgeoisie. Hence, while striving for political freedom, the bourgeoisie
      nevertheless wants to retain a number of survivals from the old regime
      (the standing army, a non-elected bureaucracy, and so forth).


The proletariat’s struggle for political freedom is revolutionary,
because its object is to secure complete democracy. The bourgeoisie’s struggle
for freedom is opportunist, be cause its object is to obtain sops, to
divide power between the autocracy and the propertied classes.


This fundamental difference between the revolutionary struggle of the
proletariat and the opportunist struggle of the bourgeoisie can be traced
through the whole history of our revolution. The proletariat is fighting, the
bourgeoisie is stealing its way into power. The proletariat is shattering the
autocracy by its struggle; the bourgeoisie clutches at the sops thrown to it by
the enfeebled autocracy. Before the whole people the proletariat holds on high
the standard of struggle; the bourgeoisie raises the flag of minor concessions,
deals and haggling.


The proletariat takes advantage of every breach, every weakening of the regime,
every concession and sop in order to wage a more extensive, more determined,
more intense and more mass struggle; the bourgeoisie uses them to cause the
struggle gradually to calm down, weaken and die out, to curtail its aims and
moderate its forms.


Let us review some of the stages of our struggle for freedom. The bourgeoisie
“fights” to compel the government to show confidence in
the Zemstvo[1]

(“Rights and an Authoritative Zemstvo”) and in the
people (at the beginning of the present decade). The proletariat unfurls the
banner of

    

the struggle to overthrow the autocracy. The government proclaims an
era of “confidence”[2]

(Svyatopolk-Mirsky). The bourgeoisie pours
out a flood of speeches at banquets; the proletariat forces new breaches in the
citadel of tyranny, dying in the streets on the 9th of January,[3]

and starting a
huge strike movement.


The summer of 1905. The bourgeoisie sends a deputation to plead for
liberties. In the autumn the Bulygin Duma[4]

is granted. The bourgeoisie is moved
to tears of gratitude. A general cry goes up: to the Duma! The opportunist
Social-Democrats waver. The proletariat continues to fight. A strike wave such
as the world has never seen before spreads over the whole country and sweeps
away the Duma. The proletariat seizes freedom and defends it with its blood
against the encroachments of the autocracy.


In the first battle the proletariat is defeated. The bourgeoisie spurns the
vanquished and slavishly clutches at the Duma. The proletariat gathers its
forces for a fresh onslaught. It continues proudly to hold on high the banner of
the struggle for complete democracy. But the onslaught could not be accomplished
before the convocation of the Duma. The bourgeoisie once again grovels, throws
overboard the slogan of a constituent assembly, froths at the mouth against
“actions” and advocates conciliation, coming to terms, and the
appointment by the supreme authority of a Cadet Cabinet.


The proletariat takes advantage of the new situation just as it did of the
period of “confidence” in 1904, and of October 17,
1905.[5]

It performs its revolutionary duty and does all in its power to sweep
away the Witte Duma[6]

as it swept away the Bulygin Duma. But it is
unsuccessful, owing to the treachery of the bourgeoisie, and the inadequate
organisation and mobilisation of the working class and peasantry. The
proletariat continues the fight, utilising all the “Duma”
conflicts and the conflicts around the Duma as points of departure for a wider
and more determined mass movement.


A new struggle is developing. No one denies this. The proletarians, the
peasants, the urban poor, the soldiers, etc., are rising in much greater masses
than before. No one denies that this will be a struggle outside the Duma. Owing
to the objective conditions of the present situation, it will

    

be a struggle directly aimed at the destruction of the old regime. To what
      extent it will be destroyed, no one can foretell. But the proletariat, as
      the advanced class, is striving with greater determination than ever for
      complete victory in this struggle, for the complete abolition of the old
      regime.


And the proletariat remains consistent, rejecting the opportunist slogans of the
bourgeoisie which have misled a certain section of the Social-Democrats. It is
not true to say that the appointment of a Cadet Cabinet means “wresting
power” from the hands of the camarilla. That is a bourgeois lie. As a
matter of fact the appointment of such a Cabinet at the present time will be a
new liberal screen for the camarilla. It is not true to say that the appointment
of a Cadet Cabinet will transform the fictitious constitution into a real
one. That is a bourgeois lie. As a matter of fact such a Cabinet will merely
enable the autocracy to cover itself with a new cloak of
pseudo-constitutionalism. It is not true to say that the demand for a Cadet
Cabinet is being taken up by the whole people. That is a bourgeois lie. As a
matter of fact it is only being demanded by the Cadet Duma. The fact that
non-Cadets are echoing it is due only to a misunderstanding, for they think it
means much more than it actually does. The demands of the whole people
are in fact much more drastic than the demands of the Cadet Duma. Lastly, it is
also not true to say that “supporting” the demand for a Cadet
Cabinet (or, what amounts to the same thing, supporting a Cadet Cabinet) with
the aid of resolutions, instructions to deputies, and so forth, means actually
fighting the old regime. That is a bourgeois lie. For the proletariat, such
“support” would simply mean abandoning the struggle, handing over
the cause of freedom to the wavering liberals.


The proletariat is fighting, and will continue to fight, to destroy the old
regime. Towards this end it will direct all its propaganda and agitation, and
all its efforts to organise and mobilise the masses. If it fails to destroy the
old regime completely, it will take advantage even of its partial
destruction. But it will never advocate partial destruction, depict this in rosy
colours, or call upon the people to sup port it. Real support in a genuine
struggle is given to those

    

who strive for the maximum (achieving something less in the event of failure)
and not to those who opportunistically curtail the aims of the struggle
before the fight.


Those who are not dazzled by flashy phrases will easily see that the people will
actually fight, not for a Cadet Cabinet, but to abolish the old
regime. It is in the interests of the bureaucracy to diminish the real
scope of this struggle. It is in the interests of the proletariat to
expand and intensify it.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]

Zemstvos—the so-called local self-government bodies,
dominated by the nobility, set up in the central gubernias of tsarist Russia in
1864. Their competence was confined to purely local economic and welfare
matters (hospital and road building, statistics, insurance, etc.), and they
functioned under the control of the provincial governors and the Minister of
the Interior, who could invalidate any decisions the government found
undesirable.





[2]

The era of “confidence” of the
government towards society was proclaimed in the autumn of 1904 by
Svyatopolk-Mirsky, Minister of the Interior. In connection with the growing
revolutionary movement the tsarist government, counting on deceiving the people
and winning over the liberal bourgeoisie, made some minor concessions—a
slight relaxation of the censorship, a partial amnesty and permission for
congresses of Zemstvo officials. The liberals welcomed this “new”
policy, as they regarded it, of the government. At their banquets they spoke of
the constitution and of the necessity of their approach to power. The Mensheviks
placed great hopes in this “banquet campaign”; they put forward a
plan for influencing the liberal bourgeoisie so that the liberals should put
political demands to the tsarist government in the name of the people. The
Bolsheviks vigorously opposed the Menshevik plan. They pointed out that to place
one’s hopes in the liberal bourgeoisie meant trailing in the rear of the
bourgeois movement and they called on the workers to head the struggle of all
the militant revolutionary forces against the autocracy. The Bolsheviks exposed
the hypocrisy of the government’s policy and its talk of a period of
“confidence”. Lenin wrote in autumn 1904: “...While it has been
flirting with the Zemstvos and has granted them some paltry concessions, the
government has not, in actual fact, con ceded anything whatever to the people;
it may still well revert to (or rather continue) its reactionary course as has
happened in Russia tens and hundreds of times after a momentary flash of
liberalism from one autocrat or another” (present edition,

Vol. 7, 

p. 506). On December 12 (25), 1904, Nicholas II signed a ukase
which emphasised the “inviolability of the fundamental laws of the
Empire” and demanded severe punishment “for all arbitrary
acts”. Although the ukase contained vague promises of some extension of
the rights of rural and urban institutions it entirely avoided the question of a
constitution for Russia. This ukase, which Lenin called a “slap in the face for
the liberals” showed that the government had decided to put an end to the
era of “confidence”.





[3]

January 9, 1905—the day on which St. Petersburg workers with
their wives and children marched towards the Winter Palace

   

to present a petition to the tsar describing their intolerable lot and complete
lack of rights. By order of the tsar this peaceful demonstration of unarmed
workers was fired on by the troops. This cold-blooded massacre started a wave of
mass political strikes and demonstrations all over Russia, under the slogan of
“Down with the autocracy!” The events of January 9 marked the beginning of
the revolution of 1905-07.





[4]

The Bulygin Duma—an advisory “representative
institution” which the tsarist government intended to convene in 1905. The
Bill for the establishment of a State Duma with advisory powers and the
Regulations on elections to the Duma were drafted by a commission presided over
by D. L. Bulygin, Minister of the Interior, and made public together with the
tsar’s Manifesto of August 6 (19), 1905. The Bolsheviks proclaimed an active
boycott of the Bulygin Duma and the government did not succeed in convening
it. It was swept away under the impact of the revolution.





[5]

This refers to the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905
issued at a time when the all-Russian political general strike was at its
height. The tsar’s Manifesto, which promised “civil liberties” an a
a “legislative” Duma, was a political manoeuvre of the autocracy
aimed at gaining time, splitting the revolutionary forces, breaking the strike
and crushing the revolution. Its promises were a deception of the masses and
were never carried out.





[6]

The Witte Duma—the First State Duma, convened on
April 27 (May 10), 1906, on a franchise drawn up by the Prime Minister
S. Y. Witte. On July 8 (21), 1906, this Duma was dissolved by the
tsarist government.

No Social-Democrat can have any doubt now that in the present situation the
pronouncements of our Party members in the Duma could be of great value to the
cause of the proletariat and of the whole people.


We welcomed the election victories of our Caucasian

      comrades.[1]

We regard it as
our duty to note their successes in the Duma and to criticise—in a
business-like way—their mistakes.


As one of their successes we consider Comrade Ramishvili’s speech on the
“danger” and “peacefulness” of the Duma. Another success
was his resolution on the Belostok pogrom[3];

yet another his
excellent criticism of the Cadets’ Public Meetings Bill and the correct
formulation of the question of Cadet project-mongering in general. We hope to
discuss these successes with our readers in greater detail another time.


As one of the mistakes we consider the silence of our Social-Democrats in the
Duma when Aladyin “swallowed” Nabokov’s mutilation of the resolution
on the food question.[4]

The Social-Democrats ought to have protested
and moved their own resolution. Another mistake was Comrade Gomarteli’s speech
in reply to the hypocrite Fedorovsky in which he, a Social-Democrat, admitted
that it was undesirable for the army to be involved in politics. This is a big
mistake, but it can still be remedied. Lastly, we also consider as a mistake
the declaration recently adopted by the Group in the Duma. This cannot be
remedied. We must now

    

examine this mistake, not in a carping spirit—our comrades’ task in the
Duma is a difficult one, and mistakes are inevitable at first—but in the
interests of the political education of the whole Party and of the whole
proletariat.


The members of our Social-Democratic Group in the Duma had received another
draft declaration from the camp of the former Bolsheviks. The following is this
draft, slightly... abbreviated (in our country, newspapers do not enjoy the same
freedom of speech as deputies in the Duma):


“Through the medium of our Group, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party, the party of the class-conscious proletariat of all the nations
inhabiting our state, addresses the whole people from the platform of the State
Duma.


“Our Party is one of the contingents of the international army of the
Social-Democratic proletariat. All over the world, the organised proletariat
that is conscious of its class interests has risen for the struggle. It is
fighting to throw off the yoke of capital. It is striving to secure the complete
emancipation of all toilers from the yoke of tyranny, poverty, oppression and
unemployment. Its object is to attain the socialist system of society, which
will abolish all division of the people into exploiters and exploited. The
Social-Democrats call upon all the toilers and the exploited to join their
ranks, not only the wage-workers, but also small proprietors, if they are
conscious of their common interests with the proletariat, if they are seeking
salvation, not by consolidating individual small production, but by fighting
jointly with the working class for the complete over throw of bourgeois
rule. And by its united and steadfast struggle the international socialist
proletariat will achieve its goal.


“In Russia, however, the struggle now going on is not for socialism, but
for political freedom. The great Russian revolution is in full swing. The yoke
of autocracy is preventing the development of the country. The tyranny of
irresponsible officials and the barbarous exploitation of the mass of the
peasantry by the landlords has roused the anger of the whole people. The
proletariat has been in the vanguard of the people’s fight. By its heroic
strike in October it compelled the enemy to recognise freedom. By its heroic
insurrection in December it prevented all further procrastination in convening

    

the assembly of the representatives of the people. In spite of the autocracy’s
      gerrymandering electoral law, its massacre, torture and imprisonment of
      the finest fighters for freedom, the State Duma, after all, turned out to
      be hostile to the autocracy.


“The people are now on the eve of another great struggle. The autocracy
jeers at the assembly of the people’s representatives and scoffs at its
demands. The anger of the workers, peasants and soldiers is steadily rising. The
outcome of the great Russian revolution will be determined by the conduct of the
various classes in society.


“In the democratic revolution that Russia is now passing through, the
Liberal bourgeoisie, represented in the State Duma by the very influential
Constitutional-Democratic Party, is inevitably endeavouring to restrict as far
as possible the rights of the propertyless classes, and of the proletariat in
particular, in order to hinder them in their struggle for complete, and not
only political, emancipation. This aim of the liberal bourgeoisie, just as
inevitably, results in its inconsistency and irresoluteness in the struggle for
freedom, its wavering between the desire to lean on the people and its fear of
the people’s revolutionary initiative. In the interests of freedom, and of
socialism, we shall most relentlessly combat these waverings. We shall most
strongly resist every attempt, no matter by whom, to obscure the irreconcilable
antagonism between the interests of the people and the old order, and between
the interests of the proletariat and those of the bourgeoisie. And we shall
exert all our efforts to combat attempts to retard the popular movement by
means of fraudulent paper concessions and the lie of conciliation between the
reactionary robbers and the revolutionary, i. e., the only true and consistent,
democrats. In particular, the touchstone of this consistency for us will be the
desire and readiness to organise a free, really popular, mass movement,
unhindered by police barriers, for an ex tensive struggle outside the Duma to
effect political and economic emancipation.


“We regard the peasantry as the chief of the potential allies of the
proletariat in the work of consummating the struggle for freedom. We
whole-heartedly support to the very end the peasants’ struggle against
semi-feudal landlordism

    

 and against the Asiatic political system in Russia. While rejecting the
utopian idea that equal land tenure is possible under capitalism, and not
permitting any attempt to obscure the difference in the interests of the
proletarians and small proprietors, we shall advocate the confiscation of all
crown, church, monastery and all landed estates. We shall strenuously
oppose the redemption payments—the noose that the liberal
bourgeoisie wants to put round the necks of the poor peasants. We shall warn the
peasants against surrendering the land to the police-bourgeois authorities,
local or central, until the victory of the revolution is achieved, and until a
really democratic state has been fully attained. When a democratic state has
been fully established, we shall advocate the transfer of all the land to the
local self-governing bodies. We shall very strongly warn the peasants against
allowing the land question to be settled by undemocratic local committees, such
as the bureaucratic and landlord committees proposed by the
Constitutional-Democratic Party.


“Throughout the course of the revolution we shall steadfastly support the
struggle of the workers for an eight-hour day, higher wages, abolition of fines,
in short, for all the demands of our Party’s minimum programme. We regard the
alliance between the proletariat and the broad masses of the urban and rural
poor as a guarantee of the further victory of the revolution. The State Duma is
useless for achieving and consolidating this victory. Only a national
constituent assembly—convened by revolutionary means and elected by a
universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot of all citizens,
irrespective of sex, creed or nationality, and endowed with complete state
power—only such an assembly can bring about complete freedom. It alone can
establish in Russia ... substitute the armed nation for the standing army,
abolish the bureaucracy that is neither elected by or responsible to the people,
and introduce complete and unrestricted political freedom.


“That is the aim that we shall steadily pursue in the present
revolution. That is the aim that the State Duma too must serve. It must help the
people to organise and fully and thoroughly to understand the necessity for over
throwing the ... regime. It must explain to the people how

    

      powerless is the present ’assembly of the people’s representatives’ and what a
      miserable role it is playing as a new screen for the old autocracy. The
      Duma must not engage in political project-mongering, or in drafting
      stillborn ’Bills’, but must appeal to the people, ruthlessly tell it the
      whole truth, ruthlessly expose before it all the crimes that are committed
      by the gang ... government of Russia, and call upon it to wage a
      consistent, steadfast, persistent and co-ordinated struggle. And if the
      State Duma as a whole is unable or hesitates to undertake this duty, we
      will perform it in alliance with the genuinely revolutionary groups or
      individual members of the Duma.


“The victory of the people is not far distant. The cause of freedom is in
reliable hands. The proletariat is at its post, mustering its forces, proudly
spurning the efforts of wretched provocateurs to provoke it to fight
single-handed, and uniting and rallying around itself the millions and tens of
millions of the oppressed and exploited living in eternal toil and eternal
poverty.


“And however weak and small our Group in the State Duma may be, we know
that behind it and with it are fighting millions of proletarians, the vanguard
of all the toiling and exploited masses. In this fight the proletariat will be
victorious. It will raze to the ground the monstrous edifice built by the
autocracy that is torturing Russia.”


Were our comrades in the Duma right in rejecting this draft?


From the formal point of view, they were. According to the Rules, they must be
guided by the Central Committee, not by “outsiders


They were also right from the factional point of view, for this draft emanated
from the “other” camp (if we reckon according to the former
factions).


But what about the Party point of view? Were they right in rejecting the
suggestion that it was desirable to formulate more clearly the socialist aims
and the international character of the Party; that it was desirable to point to
the movement outside the Duma; that it was necessary to make clear to the
people the differences between the parties in the Duma; that it was necessary to
draw a sharp distinction between proletarian and petty-bourgeois doctrines; that
it

    

was important for the workers’ party to protect .the peasants from the
Cadets; and that our immediate demands should be more clearly and fully
formulated?


Were our comrades, or our Central Committee, right in saying in their
declaration: “make the Duma an organ of the popular movement”
instead of using the formula endorsed by the Congress: make the Duma an
instrument of the revolution?


Were they right in taking on all the points enumerated above an obvious step
to the Right of the resolutions and decisions of the Unity Congress of our
Party?


Let all the organisations, and all the members, of our Party carefully consider
these questions.

This article was written in connection with the
declaration of the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma made by S. Djaparidze on
June 16(29), 1906,during the debate on the Public Meetings Bill. In drawing up
the declaration the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma rejected the Bolshevik
draft written by Lenin (this draft with some abbreviations is quoted by Lenin in
this article) and adopted the draft declaration approved by the Menshevik
Central
Committee.





[3]

This refers to the speech of I. I. Ramishvili putting forward the
resolution of the Social-Democratic Group in the debate at the 24th session of
the Duma on June 9 (22) on the anti-Jewish pogroms and police excesses in
Vologda, Kalyazin, Tsaritsyn and other places in Russia. Dealing particularly
with the pogrom in Belostok, Ramishvili said in his speech that this butchery
was engineered by the Ministry of the Interior and the government
generally. The resolution put forward by the Social-Democratic Duma Group demanded
that the entire personnel of the higher administration should be put on trial
for the crimes committed,



Later, on June29 (July 12), 1906, at the 35th Duma session, the
      Social-Democratic Group put forward a resolution specially devoted to the
      Belostok pogrom (the draft resolution was moved
      by S. Djaparidze).





[4]

At the Duma session on June 12 (25), the Minister of the
Interior Stolypin made a statement in reply to the interrogation of the Duma
concerning the measures adopted by the government for combating famine. Speaking
in the debate, the Trudovik Aladyin insisted that the government “should
not be given a kopek”. The Cadet Nabokov, however, in his own name and in
the name of Aladyin, succeeded in securing the adoption of a Cadet formula for
passing to the next business. The Social-Democratic deputies did not protest and
did not move their resolution. Lenin deals in detail with this question in the
articles: “Famine Relief and the Tactics of the Duma”, “The
Cadet Duma Grants Money to the Pogrom-Mongers’ Government” (see pp. 43-47
and pp. 60-63
of this volume).

Today, two newspapers that do not belong to the sensational boulevard press,
namely, Nasha Zhizn and Mysl,[2]

publish the important news
that the Goremykin Cabinet has at last decided to resign. The new Cabinet is
expected to be made up as follows: Yermolov—Prime Minister;
Urusov—Minister of the Interior; Herzenstein—Finance;
Timiryazev—Commerce; Stakhovich—Agriculture;
Kuzmin-Karavayev—Justice; Nabokov—Foreign Affairs. It is
believed that Heyden
will “take” Education and that the Ministry of Railways will be
taken by the present Minister, or by Shukhtan, the Chief of the Nikolayevskaya
Railway.


Thus, we have the old bureaucrats in alliance with the Octobrists and
Right Cadets, mainly ex-officials, that is to say, former bureaucrats
(Urusov was formerly Deputy Minister of the Interior, Kuzmin-Karavayev
a general, and Nabokov a gentleman-in-waiting).


Both the above-mentioned newspapers also report that lively negotiations have
been taking place recently between the “Centre Party” in the Council
of State[3]

(i.e., the gang of bureaucrats who are a cross between the Black
Hundreds and the “law and order” people[4])

and the Cadets.


Let us assume that all this is true. We must assume that it is true
until the opposite is proved; for the source of in formation is fairly reliable,
and the fact follows logically from all preceding events.


Well, whose views are proved to be right by this Cabinet, or these negotiations
between the Cadets and the pogrom-mongers? Our readers will recall that at the
meeting in the Panina Palace on May 9,[5]

the Social-Narodnik, Mr. Myakotin,
answering a Social-Democrat, protested that it was not fair to accuse the Cadets
of desiring to make a deal with the pogrom-mongers. They will also
recall that our

    

Right-wing Social-Democrats, headed by Plekhanov, loudly declared that all talk
about treachery and making deals was groundless and premature.


Negotiations mark the beginning of a deal, said the Social-Democrat in reply to
Mr. Myakotin. A deal marks the completion of

    negotiations.[1]

Well, the fact That
negotiations have been going on is now confirmed. The deal is well on the way.


But what has become of the promised complete amnesty, guarantee of liberties,
and the abolition of the Council of State? Were these questions
discussed during the negotiations between the Cadets and the pogrom-mongers?
The news papers are silent on this point. And we all know that the knights of
“people’s freedom” have never categorically stipulated
that these measures should be guaranteed before a Cadet Cabinet is
formed. It is the minor things, which are done behind the backs of the people,
which provide portfolios and soft jobs, that have been put in the
forefront. What is vital for the people has been shifted into the
background. The Cadets will “fight” for an amnesty and for freedom
when they are in the Cabinet—this is the answer that will be used to
silence the simpletons who have been spreading among the people the slogan of
supporting a “responsible” Cabinet. But this Cabinet will be
responsible as before to the laws, which remain the old, pogrom laws, and also
to the Star Chamber, or camarilla, that appointed it. And by a
“fight” for an amnesty and for freedom, the Cadets have meant in the
past, and will continue to mean: negotiations between the Rodichevs and
Nabokovs, the Nabokovs and Urusovs, the Urusovs and Goremykins and the
Goremykins and Trepovs.


But it’s an ill-wind that blows nobody any good. The Cabinet of pogrom-mongers,
Octobrists and Cadets will soon make things move; that is to say, it will drive
the Cadets towards political bankruptcy, it will help the people to cast off one
more harmful illusion, and accelerate the progress of political events towards a
revolutionary denouement.

to the Left wing
of the Cadet Party issued in St. Petersburg, with interruptions, from November
6 (19), 1904 to July 11(24), 1906.


Mysl (Thought)—a legal daily newspaper of the
S.-R.’s issued in St. Petersburg in June-July 1906.

The Council of State—one of the supreme state
bodies in pre-revolutionary Russia. It was set up in 1810 according to the plan
of M. M. Speransky as a legislative and advisory body, the members of which
were appointed and confirmed in office by the tsar. By the Law of February 20
(March 5), 1906 the Council of State was reorganised and given the right to
confirm or reject Bills after they had been debated in the State Duma. But the
right of altering basic legislation and promulgating a number of particularly
important laws rested with the tsar.


From 1906 half the members of the Council of State consisted of elected
representatives of the nobility, clergy and big bourgeoisie, the other half
consisting of dignitaries appointed by the tsar. Consequently, the Council of
State was an extremely reactionary institution, which rejected even the
moderate legislation adopted by the State Duma.





[4]

“Law and order” people—representatives of
the Party of “Law and Order”, a counter-revolutionary party of the
big industrialists, trading bourgeoisie, landlords and top section of the
bureaucracy. The Party was founded in the autumn of 1905 and took final shape
after the publication of the Manifesto of October 17. Using the watchword of
“law and order” as a disguise, the Party in fact came out strongly
in defence of the tsarist regime. It welcomed the dissolution of the First
State Duma; during the elections to the Second Duma it made a bloc with the
Black Hundreds of the “Union of True-Russian People”, proposing that
the Octobrists too should

   

enter this bloc. In 1907 the Party broke up; part of its members went over to
the Octobrists and part joined the overt Black Hundreds.





[5]

A mass meeting organised in St. Petersburg by the
socio-political club was held in Countess Panina’s Palace on May 9 (22), 1906,
in connection with the work of the Duma and its reply to the tsar’s address from
the throne.


The meeting was attended by about 3,000 persons, half of whom were
workers. Lenin, under the name of Karpov, spoke in opposition to the
“Popular Socialist” Myakotin and the Menshevik F. Dan, who defended
a bloc with the Cadets. The resolution moved by Lenin (see present edition,
Vol. 10, p.409) was adopted by the meeting almost unanimously. A report of
Lenin’s speech was printed in the Bolshevik newspaper Volna and in the
Menshevik Nevskaya Gazeta (see present edition, Vol. 10,
pp. 407-408).

More than half of the Goremykin government’s long communication on
“measures for improving the conditions of life of the peasantry” is
devoted to polemics against the views of the peasants and the talk
(“rumours”, as the Goremykins contemptuously call it) that is going
on among the people. These polemics are extremely useful. The Goremykin
government is debating with the “Russian peasantry”. It declares
that the views the peasants hold are “mistaken”, and tries to prove
to them that their demands and plans are “primarily opposed to the
interests of the peasants themselves


Now it is exceedingly praiseworthy, gentlemen of the Goremykin government, that
you should try the art of gentle persuasion! You should have tried this long
ago. It really would have been far better had you dealt with the peasants by
argument rather than by means of the birch, the knout, bullets and rifle
butts. Almost all newspapers would publish a government communication. The
village priests, the Zemstvo officials, the rural district elders and the police
officials would read it to the peasants. The peasants would ponder over it. They
would be taught sense by the government, how to understand their real
interests. And after thinking it over, and having been taught something by the
government, they would decide by a majority vote who was right. How nice it
would be if this were so! But how atrocious it is when, with one hand, the
Goremykins and their myrmidons flog, torture and murder the peasants, and with
the other, they run down their throats “communications” to teach
them to understand their own interests! Peasant newspapers are being suppressed;
peasant delegates and members of the Peasant Union[1]

are languishing in jail,
or in

    

Siberia; the villages are inundated with troops, as if they were enemy
territory—and the Goremykin government hands the flogged and tortured
peasants a communication to the effect that they are being flogged and tortured
for their own good!


This is a useful communication! It will have a splendid effect on the
peasants. The government has undertaken a little of the work of the Trudovik, or
Peasant, Group in the Duma. This Group ought to appeal to the people, to tell
them about the demands the peasant deputies in the Duma are making for land for
the peasants, and what the government says in answer to these demands. The
Trudovik Group has not yet done this. The government has come to its aid. Our
government is so clever! It has itself published a communication to the whole
people and has told them what the peasants demand.


Even in the most out-of-the-way villages, even in villages where they have never
heard about the Peasant Union and about the peasant deputies in the Duma (if
there are such villages—probably there are; ours is such a wild country),
even there, the local priest, or village elder, will read the government’s
communication. The peasants will gather round, listen quietly, and then
disperse. And afterwards they will gather again, with no officials present, and
begin to talk. They will discuss the government’s assurance that it and the
bureaucrats are not protecting the interests of the landlords. They will chuckle
and say:

“Oh no, they wouldn’t dream of such a thing!” They will discuss
the statement that voluntary sale of the land by the landlords, particularly if
it is done through the medium of the government officials, will be far more
advantageous to the peasants than compulsory alienation (perhaps even without
redemption payment). They will chuckle and say: “What fools we have been
not to have realised up to now that it is far better for us to obey the
landlords and the bureaucrats than to decide all matters for ourselves.”


But perhaps the peasants will not only chuckle? Perhaps they will reflect over
something else, and not only with laughter, but with rage? Perhaps they will
decide for themselves not only where truth lies, but how to attain it?...


Our government is so clever!

 

Incidentally, Mr. Muromtsev, the Cadet Chairman of the State Duma, tells us not
      to use the word: government. It is wrong, if you please. The Duma, too, is
      part of the government. We must say: the Cabinet. Then we shall conclude
      just like “gentlemen” do: the Duma is the legislature, and the
      Cabinet the executive; the Duma is part of the government.


Kind Mr. Muromtsev! Kind Cadets! They have so painstakingly studied the German
books on state law that they know them by heart. They know the business better
than Goremykin, who in his communication does not say a word about the
Duma, but refers all the time to the government. Who is right,
Goremykin or Muromtsev? What should we say:

Cabinet or Government?


Goremykin is right. His refinement ... humph! humph!

his subtle mind ... caused him inadvertently to speak the truth. The Muromtsevs,
being professors and pundits, utter conventional lies.


The peasants will learn something from Goremykin, not from Muromtsev. They will
want to settle accounts with the government, not with the Cabinet. And they will
be right.

[1]

The All-Russian Peasant Union—a
revolutionary-democratic organisation which arose in 1905. It demanded political
liberty and the immediate convocation of a constituent assembly; it supported
the tactics of boycotting the First State Duma. The agrarian programme of the
Union included demands for the abolition of private ownership of the land and
for the transfer of monastery, church, crown and state lands to the peasants
without redemption payments. The Union was half-hearted and wavering in its
policy. While demanding the abolition of landlord ownership o land, it agreed to
partial compensation of the landlords. From the very beginning of its activities
the Peasant Union was subjected to police persecution. The Union ceased to
exist by 1907.

Today’s newspapers report that a joint meeting of the Budget and Food committees
of the State Duma was held on Wednesday, June 21. The meeting discussed the
proposal of the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance to appropriate
50 million rubles for famine relief. “The Committee resolved to recommend
that the State Duma assign 15 million rubles for immediate needs, the sum to be
taken from current expenditure, and to request the Cabinet to submit its views
on the question of reducing the estimated current expenditure by that
amount. The Cabinet’s proposal that an internal loan of 50 million rubles be
issued was rejected” (Rech,[1]

June 22).


The question of appropriating funds for famine relief is an extremely important
one. Every intelligent citizen should watch the progress of this question
through all its stages with unremitting attention.


First of all we will remind the reader that the question that originally arose
in the State Duma was the following:

Would it be right to grant money to the government of pogrom-mongers, or should
the Duma itself take the whole business of famine relief into its own hands? At
first, Deputy Aladyin spoke in favour of the correct, i.e., the latter,
solution. He proposed that committees of the Duma be elected, that members of
the Duma be sent to the affected areas, that recourse should be made to
“free institutions”, and the money and the whole business of famine
relief concentrated in their hands. Not a kopek for the Gurkos and
Durnovos!— said Aladyin, amidst applause from the Left benches of the

    

Duma and cries of: Hear, hear! As we know, Aladyin did not keep to this correct
      position. He soared very high, but eventually settled on the perch in the
      Cadet hencoop. The Social-Democratic deputies made a mistake in not
      expressing their views by strong speeches on this question. The Duma
      adopted the Cadet formula of a motion to proceed to the next business.


Thus, the fundamental question of principle was settled on Cadet, landlord,
liberal lines. The Duma refused to be come the instrument of the revolution in
this matter. The Duma feared the people, dreaded an appeal to the people. In
principle, the Duma agreed to leave the business of famine relief in the hands
of the Gurkos and the pogrom-mongering Ministers. Thus, the Cadet Duma has shown
that it only wants to exercise pressure on the pogrom-mongers with the help of
the people, and not to fight on the side of the people against the
pogrom-mongers; that it only wants to curb the pogrom-mongers a little, but not
to remove them altogether.


The question has entered a second stage. How will the Cadets exercise pressure
on the pogrom-mongers now? Haggling has begun between the Committee of the Duma
and the Ministers. At the meeting of the Committee on June 21 the Minister of
the Interior and the Minister of Finance were present. The Duma that would have
no dealings with the people and with “free institutions”, that
refused to negotiate with the latter, began to negotiate with these
Ministers. “Not a kopek for the Right Honourable Ministers”—that was
merely a rhetorical flourish. Negotiations with the Right Honourable Ministers
have become a fact. The Ministers asked for permission to float a loan. The
Committee of the Duma refused. They demanded that the money be taken from this
year’s Budget, i. e., that certain harmful expenditure be reduced so
as to provide the necessary sum for famine relief. By this tactical device, this
flanking movement, the Duma is seizing a particle of right to control the State
Budget. The Budget was adopted without the consent of the representatives of the
people; but now a revision of the Budget with a view to reducing harmful
expenditure and obtaining funds for useful expenditure is being secured in a
roundabout way.

 

Such is the second stage of the question. The Cadets, that is, the party of the
liberal landlords and the liberal bourgeoisie, want to control the organs of the
old regime; they want to influence them, to clean them and paint them
up; to substitute the Nabokovs for the Stolypins. But they
don’t want to replace all these organs and institutions of the old,
police, feudal regime by tree institutions of the people, by officials
freely elected by the whole people. How is the money for famine relief to be
obtained? Who is to be entrusted with the expenditure of these millions? Three
main answers to these questions are offered by the three main political forces
of the present period. The government of police pogrom-mongers answers: Obtain
the money by floating a new loan, so as not to encroach on our police- pogrom
Budget. We, the police and pogrom-mongers, will spend the money. The working
class, and all the politically conscious peasants, answer: Let the people
themselves collect the money and spend it themselves through the medium of
“free institutions” really elected by the whole people and really
without any connection with the dirty police. These free institutions must be
used for developing a broad mass movement to transfer all power in the state,
and the whole “Treasury”, to the people. The liberal landlords and
the liberal bourgeoisie (“Cadets”) answer: We don’t want any “free
institutions”, we are afraid of them. The people would go “too
far”. Much better to remain with the old pogrom- mongers, and just clean
and scrub them a bit. Take the money from their Budget by cutting down harmful
expenditure. Entrust the expenditure of the money to this government of
pogrom-mongers, but try to bring them under our, that is, the liberal landlords’
control.


The answers are clear. So are the positions of the government, the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat. The only question is, whom will the peasants follow?


The liberal bourgeoisie, the Cadets, are wavering between the government and
the people. The position of the waverers is ambiguous. It is easy to say: Take
the money from the current Budget by cutting down harmful expenditure! But the
money is needed at once, and this operation requires the consent of the
Council of State and the head of the state. Hence, the Cadets must be counting
on obtaining

    

the voluntary consent of the higher officials and the camarilla. What are the
      Cadets’ calculations based on? On the possibility of a deal over the
      composition of the next Cabinet.


We must look reality straight in the face. It is useless playing the
hypocrite. It is useless playing hide-and-seek. The necessity of assigning money
for famine relief is being used as a counter in the haggling that is going
between the Cadets and the pogrom-mongers’ government, between the Cadets and
the camarilla. The Cadets, in effect, say to the pogrom-mongers: If you
gentlemen give way to us and appoint Muromtsev as Prime Minister instead of
Yermolov, we will give way to you and grant you 15 and perhaps all 50 millions
for famine relief, without any “dangerous” (for you pogrom-mongers
as well as us landlords) recourse to “free institutions” of the
people.


That is the true significance of the present events in the Duma. That
is the true significance of Mr. Yeshchin’s article in today’s issue of the Cadet
newspaper Rech, which the leading article in that paper commends, with
slight reservations, and in which the author argues that the Duma should grant
the pogrom-mongers’ government money, but “fence this grant round with all
the conditions that the Duma can reasonably demand”.


The political situation is clear. Our Social-Democratic deputies in the Duma are
now faced with a very serious task. Firstly, they must launch a major attack
against the Cadets when the Budget and Food Committee’s report comes up for
discussion. They must demand recourse to “free institutions” of the
people. They must open the eyes of the peasants to the reason why the Cadets,
among whom there are so many landlords, are afraid of the people who need
all the land—without any redemption payment—and
complete freedom. They must insist on a vote being taken on their resolution on
this question, so that the party of the proletariat may be ensured of the
sympathy of all the toiling masses, and so that the wavering and cowardice of
the liberal landlords may be clearly and publicly exposed.


Secondly, when the Cadets defeat the proposal to have recourse to free
institutions, the Social-Democrats must launch a second attack from our next
fortified line. They must demand an explanation why the Committee (the joint

    

Budget and Food Committee) has not published all the details of their
negotiations with the Right Honourable gentlemen, the Ministers of the Interior
and of Finance. They must be well prepared for a far more thorough and resolute
criticism of the whole Budget than that made by the Cadets in the
Committee. Voices will then be heard from the rostrum of the Duma relentlessly
exposing the double game the Cadets are playing, exposing all the
“secrets” of the Russian Budget of the police pogrom-mongers—a
Budget which squanders tens and hundreds of millions on assistance for landlords
and capitalists, on military adventures, on “relief” for spies and
gendarmes, on rewarding all the high-placed heroes of the Manchurian
tragedy,[2]

and on maintaining a horde of thieving officials who tyrannise over the
people. Voices will be heard from the rostrum of the Duma proving that
harmful expenditure amounts to much more than 15 or 50 millions.


The Cadets only want to exercise a little pressure on the government. The
pogrom-mongers will be the first to be called to account by the
Social-Democrats; but the Cadets, too, will have to answer for their attempt to
gloss over the profound antagonism between the camarilla and the people.

Yesterday we published newspaper reports about the contemplated formation of a
Cabinet consisting of Yermolov, Urusov, Nabokov, Heyden and

       others.[1]

Commenting
on this list today, Rech says: “Evidently, the compilers of this
list included members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party only tentatively;
actually, the Constitutional-Democratic Party will take no part in a Cabinet of
this character.”


That is all very well, gentlemen of the Cadet

Party I But 

how does Rech
know that the Constitutional-Democratic Party will take no part in such a
Cabinet?


The reader will ask: What do you mean by “how does Rech know”? Is
not Rech the chief organ of the Cadets? Quite right. But in putting
that question we wanted to suggest that it is unbecoming, in the
highest degree unbecoming, for a party like the Constitutional-Democratic
Party, which has held congresses legally, predominates in the State Duma, and is
a wealthy, “enlightened” and liberal-minded party, to play
hide-and-seek. Is it not high time it was said that Rech is the
official and chief organ of that party? Is it not high time that the resolutions
of the Central Committee of the Cadet Party were published? One of two things,
gentlemen: Either your party has not officially discussed the question
of the kind of Cabinet it will “take part in In that case you should say
so plainly. In that case, Rech should speak on its own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, that is: “We are
sure that the Constitutional-Democratic Party will not take part”,
etc.

 

Or your party has officially discussed this question. In that case you
should publish the minutes of that discussion, otherwise your silence proves
that you are conducting secret negotiations behind the backs of the people.


“Today a more homogeneous list is being discussed,” says Rech
further, quoting only the names of Yermolov, Timiryazev, Heyden and Stakhovich,
that is to say, bureaucrats and Octobrists, but no Cadets. Thus,
negotiations have taken place. The Cadets were asked—perhaps
through the medium of the “Centre Party” in the Council of
State—will you take part in such a Cabinet? The Cadets answered: No, we
will not.


Is that what happened, gentlemen? Have there been negotiations, or not? Did you
state your terms, or not? Did your terms refer exclusively to the
appointment of definite persons to the Cabinet, or did they also stipulate a
complete amnesty, guaranteed liberties, abolition of the Council of State, and
universal suffrage?


Until the Constitutional-Democratic Party officially gives full and absolutely
precise answers to these questions we shall not tire of repeating to the people:
Citizens, beware! Members of the party of “people’s freedom” are
conducting “unofficial” negotiations behind the backs of the people
with a view to selling the people’s freedom at a bargain price.

In Golos Truda,[2]

Comrade N. Rakhmetov discusses “the political tasks of Russian
Social-Democrats”. Four columns of this article are taken up by
arguments to prove that



“it is not to the advantage of the proletariat, as one of the classes that
are active in Russia today, to leave the Duma to its own resources. That would
mean that the proletariat would strike itself off from the list of vital
political forces, and the only result would he that the proletariat would fail
to utilise the Russian bourgeois revolution to the extent it could do.”



“It is enough to formulate the question in this way,” says N. Rakhmetov,
“to see that there can only be one answer to it.” Quite true, Comrade
Rakhmetov. The unfortunate thing, however, is that this is not a
“formulation of the question”, but a threadbare platitude.


The “question” has never been formulated in this way. It is
quite evident, however, that Comrade Rakhmetov knows how it has
been—and is now—formulated, for from the above quoted tirade he very
surprisingly draws the following conclusion:



“It is the proletariat’s duty—to itself as well as to the whole
country—not only to refrain from being passively neutral in the struggle
between the Duma and the autocracy, but boldly and resolutely to take the
side of the Duma against the government in this struggle.”



Now this is where the “question” does arise. And Comrade Rakhmetov
realises it, for he foresees that

 


“the newspaper

   Svetoch[1]

will probably be very
sceptical about such tactics. That newspaper writes:

’The only flaw in this
flawless dialectical plan of a “revolution through the Duma” is that
it leaves out of account the mundane, prosaic fact that the present Duma
consists, in the main, of bourgeois elements who dread revolution and,
consequently, are hostile to it.’ Arguments like these may serve as a splendid
illustration of how a Social-Democrat should never argue under any
circumstances. A Social-Democrat ought to know that the political tactics of the
proletariat are not dictated by the moods of other social groups, but
by the objective historical process that compels these groups to
act in a certain way. A Social-Democrat ought to know and take into
account what the classes with which he has to deal are compelled to
do. If he formulates the question in this way he will be convinced of the
following: by expressing readiness to render the Duma revolutionary support
against tsarism, the proletariat will thereby compel the Duma to become
more revolutionary in its actions. Politically, one must be very immature indeed
not to understand this simple ’truth’.”



What a queer argument! According to Comrade Rakhmetov, even though our
bourgeoisie is counter-revolutionary, it can be compelled to become
revolutionary.


For this purpose, it appears, “the Duma must be

surround ed 

with a flaming
circle of revolutionary pressure”. The Duma will then be confronted with
the “question”: “either be consumed in the flames or merge
with them”; “the question of life or death”.


We are very much afraid that Comrade Rakhmetov will get a severe gruelling from
Comrade Plekhanov for his metaphysical “formulation of the
question”, for his inability to formulate a most important political
question dialectically. How often the former Mensheviks, and Comrade Plekhanov,
have protested against this “either—or” method of formulating
political questions! Why necessarily “either be consumed in the flames or
merge with them”? Does Comrade Rakhmetov really think that the Herzenstein and
Nabokov faction has no other alternative? Why, for example, should they not, in
alliance with the more “decent” bureaucrats, attempt to break
through this “flaming circle of revolutionary pressure”?


We, for example, think that if the victoriously rising tide of revolution
compels the leading elements of the Cadet

    

Party to do anything at all, it will be to try this third way out, i.e., simply
      to make a deal with the bureaucrats.


It is quite probable that the “party of people’s freedom” in its
present shape may be “consumed” in this attempt; but when will
comrades like Rakhmetov understand, at last, that all the noise and fuss the
Cadets have been making about people’s freedom has been simply a stepping stone
to ministerial portfolios and not to the “struggle against tsar
ism”, which comrades like Rakhmetov are so unsuccess fully trying to foist
upon them. And speaking generally, the masters of the Duma—for the time
being—are the Cadet Centre; and you want to surround this Duma
“with a flaming circle of revolutionary pressure”. That is all very
well; it is certainly important and necessary. But should not all those who are
“pressing” constantly be warned that they will inevitably ... press
the present masters of the Duma into the arms of the bureaucrats? Shouldn’t
they, Comrade Rakhmetov?

It sometimes happens that experienced and cautious statesmen, who appreciate
their responsibility for every important political step they take, send out in
advance young and somewhat incautious tyros to reconnoitre, as it
were. “No use to waste a clever lad,”[3]

they say to them
selves, anticipating that the young men will blurt out some minor secret or
other, which will serve as a feeler.


Comrade N. Rakhmetov, writing in Golos Truda, gives one the impression
of just such a tyro fulfilling this intended mission. But that is exactly why,
from a certain angle, Comrade Rakhmetov’s very trivial article—we poked
fun at it

      yesterday[1]

–undoubtedly

acquires political importance. If an
influential organ of our Right-wing Social-Democrats like Golos Truda
publishes, without a single editorial comment, an article calling upon the
Social-Democrats to ally themselves with the Cadets it shows that our Party is
suffering from some serious malady. No matter how much cautious, experienced and
shrewd men may try to conceal its symptoms, the malady shows itself in spite of
them. To keep silent about it would be a great crime.


The fundamental mistake of the opportunist Social-Democrats lies in their
failure to understand what the decisive victory of the bourgeois revolution
means. Our Russian opportunists who, like all opportunists, belittle the theory
of revolutionary Marxism and the role of the proletariat as the vanguard,
constantly labour under the illusion that the liberal bourgeoisie must
inevitably be the “boss” in the bourgeois revolution. They totally
fail to understand the

    

      historical role of, say, the Convention in the great French Revolution as the
      dictatorship of the lower strata of society, those of the proletariat and
      the petty-bourgeoisie. They totally fail to understand the idea of the
      dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry as the only possible social
      bulwark of a fully victorious Russian bourgeois revolution.


In essence, opportunism means sacrificing the long-term and permanent interests
of the proletariat for flashy and temporary interests. In the period of the
bourgeois revolution, the opportunist Social-Democrat forgets the importance of
the revolutionary wing of the bourgeois democrats and pays slavish homage to the
successes of the non-revolutionary wing of these bourgeois democrats. He loses
sight of the essential difference between the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie
(Constitutional-Democratic Party, Party of Democratic Reforms,[4]

etc.) and the revolutionary, particularly, the peasant, bourgeois
democrats. We have drawn the attention of our Right-wing comrades to this
difference hundreds if not thousands of times. The Bolshevik draft resolution
for the

       Congress[2]

very clearly stated that the liberal bourgeoisie is trying to
make a deal with the old regime, is wavering between revolution and reaction, is
afraid of the people, and afraid of the free and all-sided development of their
activities; and that all this is not due to chance, but to its fundamental
interests. We said that we must utilise the democratic phrases uttered by this
bourgeoisie, and utilise the timid steps it takes; but we must not for a moment
forget its “compromising” and treacherous strivings. The peasant
democrats, on the other hand, owing to the objective conditions in which the
mass of the peasants find themselves, are compelled to act in a revolutionary
manner, in spite of the fact that they are not fully politically conscious. The
fundamental interests of these bourgeois democrats are not at present
impelling them to seek a deal, but are compelling them to fight determinedly
against the old regime. To avoid sacrificing the fundamental interests of the
proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a sharp distinction must be
drawn between the liberal, or

    


    

“Cadet”, bourgeois democrats, and the peasant, or revolutionary,
      bourgeois democrats.


It is this that the opportunist Social-Democrats do not wish to understand,
although events have brilliantly con firmed the correctness of this distinction
and continue to do so. In the Duma, too, the peasant democrats become a distinct
group by being compelled to draw closer to the revolution, and to strive to free
themselves from the yoke of the Cadets. The Cadets and Octobrists versus the
Trudoviks and Social-Democrats—such is the alignment that has already
taken place both on the question of instituting elected local land
committees, and on the question of the Cadets’ attempt to “curb”
freedom of assembly.


The comrades of the Right wing of Social-Democracy are blind to these
facts. Dazzled by the immediate situation, they are inclined to identify the
party that at present predominates in the Duma, i.e., the
Constitutional-Democratic Party, with the bourgeois democrats in
general. N. Rakhmetov is particularly naïve in repeating this old mistake of
the Mensheviks. While the “old hands” artfully get round the
unpleasant deductions that must be drawn from wrong premises, the tyros chatter
and blurt out the truth. If the Constitutional-Democrats represent the genuine
bourgeois democrats in general (and not merely the worst strata of the
bourgeoisie, and small upper strata at that) then, naturally, the necessary
fighting alliance between the proletariat and the bourgeois democrats must be an
alliance with the Cadets. The proletariat can, and must, be in the forefront of
the fight for the victory of the bourgeois revolution, while strictly preserving
its class independence. But without the bourgeois democrats it cannot
carry through this revolution to the end. With whom, then, should it
“march separately, but strike together”? With the liberal democrats, or
with the peasant democrats?


With the liberals, with the Cadets, twitters Rakhmetov. Why hesitate? The Cadets
are on top; they are more conspicuous; they are flashy and glib! With the
Cadets, of course, with the Cadets! “It is much easier for the Cadets to
twist and turn,” says Rakhmetov, “when they are surrounded by a solid
wall of hostility than it would be if they were approached with an offer of a
political coalition,

    

· Much more can be achieved by the pressure of public opinion on the
      Cadets (by sending to the Duma resolutions, instructions, petitions and
      demands, organising protest meetings, negotiations between the
      Workers’ Group and the Cadets) than by senseless, and therefore
    useless, rowdyism, to put it strongly” (our italics).


Here then is a completely formulated deduction, for which Rakhmetov fully
deserves a testimonial bearing the inscription: “From the grateful
Bolsheviks”. Political alliances with the Cadets, negotiations between
Social-Democrats and Cadets—what a clear and precise slogan! All we
have to do now is to spread this Menshevik slogan as widely as possible
throughout the workers’ party and put to the workers the question: Who is
for alliances with the Cadets? Whoever knows anything of the proletariat
will have no doubt about what the answer will be.


The same issue of Golos Truda contains what is substantially a correct
warning by the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. against Social-Democrats
merging with the Trudoviks. But Golos Truda has rendered the Central
Committee of our Party a disservice by converting this warning into a cloak for
advocacy of an alliance between the Social-Democrats and the Cadets! Nothing
could be more calculated to discredit the Social-Democrats than this action of
combining a—substantially correct, we repeat—warning
against Social-Democrats merging with the revolutionary
bourgeoisie, with the advocacy of an alliance between the
Social-Democrats and the opportunist bourgeoisie!


And what moment have our Mensheviks chosen to advocate such an alliance? The
moment when the alliance between the revolutionary and opportunist bourgeoisie,
between the Trudoviks and the Cadets, is breaking down. A very
appropriate moment, indeed, for our good Rakhmetov to choose for launching his
crusade! The very moment that the Trudoviks— with the help of the
Social-Democrats be it said—are beginning to break away from the Cadets,
to throw off their yoke, to vote against them and to rally against the
“alliance” between the Cadets and the Octobrists. And people like
Rakhmetov have the presumption to talk pompously about revolutionising the Duma,
when, as a matter of fact, they are helping the Cadets to degrade the Duma.

 

Remember this, gentlemen: alliances and negotiations with the Cadets are the
worst way of exercising pressure on them. In practice, it will mean blunting the
independent struggle of the Social-Democrats, and not Social-Democratic pressure
on the Cadets. It is those who relentlessly expose every false step of the
Cadets that are helping to revolutionise the Duma and are “exercising
pressure” on the Cadets. Refusal to support these false steps exerts far
more pressure on the Cadet Duma than any negotiations with the Cadets with a
view to supporting them. The Workers’ Group refused to vote for the reply to the
address from the throne: the Cadets had emasculated it. The Workers’ Group has
refused to support the Cadets; thereby it has discredited them in the eyes of
the people and has shifted morally the focus of public attention from the Cadets
to the “Left” core of the Duma. By ruthlessly denouncing the
half-heartedness of the Cadet Duma we are revolutionising the Duma
and—what is more important—the people who believe in the Duma. We
thereby, in effect, issue a call to throw off the Cadet yoke, to act more
boldly, determinedly and consistently. We thereby also cause a cleavage among
the Cadets and make their ranks waver under the joint assault of the
Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks.


We are carrying out the policy of the proletariat as the vanguard fighter in the
revolution and not as an appendage of the most timid and pitiful upper ranks of
the liberal bourgeoisie.

The inevitable has happened. From now on, the Budget of the autocratic
government of pogrom-mongers will contain a small item that has been
approved by the “people’s”— if you
please—representatives. It’s the first step that’s difficult, as the
French say; or as we say in Russia: the first glass must be forced down, the
second trickles down, and all the others glide down in a merry stream. The
Cadets have swallowed the first glass in company with the henchmen of the
autocracy.


Let us carefully trace the course of this historical event. The Minister of the
Interior and the Minister of Finance asked the Duma to grant 50 million rubles
for famine relief. “Legally”, the Ministers could not
obtain this money, could not take control of the relief campaign, without the
consent of the Duma. The Ministers did not ask the Duma who is to be in charge
of this campaign: “Legally”, it must in any case be in the
hands of the pogrom—mongers’ government. Nor did the Ministers indicate in
their proposal how the money is to be obtained. They merely said: “To
allow the Minister of Finance to procure.” It was only in the Committee that the
Ministers proposed that a loan be floated to provide the money. Yesterday,
however, the Minister of Finance bluntly stated in the Duma: “It is within
the competence of the State Duma to authorise procurements, but the manner of
procurement [we are quoting from Rech and take no responsibility
for the

style][1]

“is determined by the supreme

    

power.” Thus, all that the Ministers had to obtain from the Duma was an
assignment in general, but they were less concerned about the sources.


Two main solutions of the problem, which we indicated the other

 day,[2]

were at once put forward in the Duma. The Cadets proposed that a sum of 15 million
rubles be assigned with the proviso that an account of its expenditure be
submitted to the Duma, and that the amount be taken out of the “anticipated
savings” in the 1906 Budget. That, and nothing more. But the Minister of
Finance very coolly said in reply to the Cadets: “If the State Duma
decides to grant 15 mil lion rubles,the Ministry of Finance will release that
sum ...

but will release it not from anticipated savings but from other secured
items of expenditure.” After making the expenditure, the Minister “will
come to the State Duma and say: You compelled us to make an expenditure for which
we found no surpluses.”


Thus, the matter is as clear as daylight. The Minister simply spat in the face
of the Cadet Duma: We shall use your permission to take 15 million rubles, he
said in effect, but as for your decision about “savings”, it is just
empty words. The Minister did not hesitate to say that there would be no
savings. He did not hesitate to say that he was quite willing to obtain money by
assignment of the Duma, but he snapped his fingers at its advice about
“savings”.


What role did the Cadet Duma actually play in this business? The role
of a witness called by the police to approve its expenditure of money
filched from the people. “Legally”, the signature of witnesses is
required for the appropriation of money. The police demanded the signature. The
Cadet Duma gave it. That is all the police wanted. The fact that the witnesses
kicked a bit, did not worry them in the least.


But it was the Cadet Duma that played the part of police witnesses. The
Social-Democratic deputies took up an entirely different and correct
position. They spoke on the lines that we suggested the other day. “I
declare, gentlemen,” said Comrade Ramishvili in his excellent speech,
“that if we grant the government a farthing, even that farthing will never
reach the people.” In their resolution, which we published

    

     yesterday, the Social-Democrats quite rightly said that no money should
    be given to the autocratic government, that the State Duma ought to set up
    its own relief committee, send its members to the affected areas
    and invite the co-operation of “free public organisations”. The
    Social-Democrats turned their resolution into a revolutionary appeal to the
    people which branded the government as “the real culprit responsible
    for the famine”, squandering the people’s money on waging war against
    the people. The Social-Democrats demanded the cessation of
    expenditure on the gendarmerie, the political police, the rural mounted
    police, and so forth; they demanded a reduction in the salaries and
    pensions of high-placed drones and an audit of the cash balance and
    accounts of the Treasury. They also quite rightly demanded that the
    revenues from crown, church and monastery lands be used for famine
    relief. The Social-Democrats openly indicted the old regime as a whole, and
    all its organs, and also criticised the whole Budget.


How did the Duma vote? The Cadets won, of course. According to the unanimous
statements of a number of newspapers, the Trudoviks voted with the
Social-Democrats (unfortunately, a roll-call vote was not taken). The
political alignment is becoming more and more distinct. The Octobrists and
Cadets are in favour of coming to terms with the old regime. The
Social-Democrats and Trudoviks are strongly opposed to this. The vigorous and
united action of the Social-Democrats not only won over the peasants, but even
caused a slight split among the Cadets. Not only the Left Galetsky, but even the
Right Kuzmin-Karavayev was ashamed of playing the role of police witness. It was
the Cadets, and the Cadets alone, who put the shameful signature of the
“people’s representatives” to the assignment of money to the
pogrom-mongers.


This signature of the Cadet Duma is of enormous importance in principle. Naive
people and short-sighted politicians often say: The accusation that the Cadets
are traitors and want to make a deal with the bureaucrats is ground less and
premature. But this assignment of money to the pogrom-mongers’ government is
just such a deal—and strictly speaking, not the first. Look at the
miserable shifts the Cadets resort to in their attempts to justify themselves.

    

This is a compromise, yells Nasha Zhizn, but it is justified by the
temporary circumstances. Of course, gentlemen, all compromises between the
bourgeoisie and the police autocracy have always been attributed to temporary
circumstances.


But the peasants need immediate relief! Have not the peasant deputies betrayed
the peasants? What do you think, gentlemen of the Cadet Party? The peasant
deputies voted against the grant because they know better than you do where the
money would go after passing through police hands. Why could not the State Duma
take this matter in its own hands?


That is utopian, impracticable; we must reckon with the available organisation
until it is changed by law—is the unanimous cry of the Heydens,
Kokovtsovs, Milyukovs, and even the Bernsteinians of Nasha Zhizn. Yes,
gentle men, the bourgeoisie always regards the abolition of all the organs of
the old regime as utopian because it wants to use these organs against the
proletariat and against the revolutionary peasantry. In a police-ridden class
state there will always be an endless amount of “urgent”
expenditure. Once they have been engaged officials must be maintained; con
tracts that have been concluded must be paid for, and so on and so forth. There
will always be an “available organisation” (namely, the
police-bureaucratic organisation) which it is “impossible” to
change at one stroke, without the consent of the Council of State, and so on
and so forth.


Such excuses will always be found. These are the excuses that the liberal
bourgeoisie hands out to credulous people in every country. These excuses are
the natural screen with which the bourgeoisie tries to cover up its betrayal of
the cause of the people’s freedom.


The proletariat will always fight this hypocritical game. It will call upon the
people to fight against all the organs and institutions of the old regime; to
fight through the medium of the free organisations of the working class and the
revolutionary peasantry.

Yesterday we published the main resolutions adopted by the Fifth Congress of the
Polish Social-Democratic Party.[1]

The Polish
comrades—25,000-3O,000 strong, now affiliated to our
Party—expressed their emphatic opposition to the Central Committee’s
tactics in relation to the State Duma. Condemning these tactics as a whole, they
did not deem it necessary to dwell on the individual mistakes that inevitably
follow from these wrong tactics, such as the notorious support for a Cadet
Cabinet. But it goes without saying— and those who were present at the
Polish Congress know this perfectly well—that the Polish Social-Democrats
are absolutely opposed to this “support”. The Conference,
representing all the St. Petersburg Social-Democrats also emphatically rejected
support for a Cadet Cabinet[2];

and the Regional Conference
representing the Social-Democrats of the Central Moscow District, too,
pronounced against it.[3]


The St. Petersburg Conference represented about 4,000 Party members, and the
Moscow Regional Conference about 14,000. Thus, about 20,000 members of
the. Party, that is, the major half of the membership (at the last congress
31,000-33,000 members were represented) have condemned the Central
Committee’s tactics on the question of supporting a Duma Cabinet. The
majority of the Party membership is opposed to this policy. Our Party Cabinet,
that is to say, the Central Committee of our Party, no longer expresses the
Party’s opinion. Its elementary political duty now is to expedite the convening
of an immediate extraordinary congress. If it fails to do that it will become a
clique, clinging to power in the Party on pretexts for delay and excuses of a
formal nature, in spite of the expressed opinion of the Party

    

on the substance of the issue. At all events, the Party will now be
able to secure the convocation of a congress.


The Mensheviks continue to advocate the tactics of supporting a Duma,
i.e., a Cadet Cabinet, tactics that have been
condemned by the majority
of the Party membership (although, as the discussion in St. Petersburg has
shown, a number of Mensheviks have now taken up an independent position and have
turned away from opportunism). Let us, once again, examine the current arguments
of the Right-wing Social-Democrats.


We are told that to secure the appointment of a Duma Cabinet means
“wresting power from the hands of the camarilla”, means
“making the executive power responsible to the representative assembly of
the people”; that it is “the transition from a pseudo-constitutional
system to a real constitution” (Golos Truda, No. 5).


That is a downright lie. The Duma, i.e., Cadet, Cabinet will be
appointed (if the Cadets’ demand is conceded) by the camarilla. But can
the appointment of liberal Cabinet Ministers by the camarilla be called
“wresting power”. Appointing Ministers at its own discretion, the
camarilla can dismiss them at any time. The camarilla does not surrender power,
but pretends to share power; the camarilla tests the liberal
flunkeys to see whether they suit it or not. The shrewd members of the
camarilla, like Pobedonostsev and Trepov, for example (judging by certain
newspaper reports), frankly argue in this way: the best thing for us would be to
appoint liberal Ministers. By so doing we should not only pacify the Cadets
(i.e., the majority in the Duma) but also the pro-Cadet Social-Democrats. And
it is much easier to get rid of undesirable Ministers than to get rid of the
Duma, let us say. We shall gain time, shuffle the cards, create utter chaos,
mutual distrust and bickering over ministerial port folios in the Right wing,
i.e., the major half, of the Duma, stir up trouble, and lead the Cadets by the
nose as we did on the question of famine relief. On that question we compelled
them “voluntarily” to play the role of police witnesses. Similarly,
in their ministerial office we shall compel them to play the role of police
flunkeys.


Whoever is at all familiar with the history of the Russian Cadets, and of the
“Cadets” in other countries,

knoWs 

that

    

the camarilla has always succeeded in leading the liberal- monarchist
      bourgeoisie by the nose. The only way to prevent this is to develop the
    independent political consciousness of the proletarians and
    revolutionary peasants. And it is just the Right Social-Democrats who are
    now obscuring and muddling this consciousness. To keep the political
    consciousness of the revolutionary classes absolutely clear, and to
    preserve their complete fighting independence, we Social-Democrats must
    leave it entirely to the Cadets to grovel at the feet of the camarilla for
    the sake of ministerial jobs. To involve the proletariat in this business
    would be to betray the interests of the proletariat and the interests of the
    revolution.


If the camarilla were to appoint Cadets as Ministers it would make “the
executive power responsible to the representative assembly of the people”
(Golos Truda).


That is a downright lie. When Cadet professors say it— well, God will
forgive them. But it is unpardonable for a Social-Democrat to repeat it. The
executive power, most worthy yes-men, is not responsible to “the
representative assembly of the people”, but to the legislative
power. Please remember this. Now let us explain the matter further. In
whose hands is the legislative power in Russia today?

1) The supreme authority;

2) the Council of State;

3) the State Duma.


Do you understand your mistake now? The Cadet Ministers will be responsible to
the Duma, to the Council of State and to the camarilla. To try to make out that
they will be responsible only to the Duma means lying to the people.


To proceed. What will be the position of Ministers who are responsible to the
most diverse institutions? A false one. The Ministers will be obliged to
observe and uphold all the existing laws until they are repealed by all
the three legislative bodies enumerated above. It is not surprising, therefore,
that eloquent Cadets like Rodichev, are gesticulating in the Duma and
declaiming that they are—the shield of the dynasty. The Cadets know what’s
what. The Right Social-Democrats, however, try to sing in harmony with them, but
they don’t understand what they are doing.


Why has the Cabinet become the focal point of the Cadets’ campaign? Why are they
not shouting equally zealously, frequently and loudly: Down with the Council of
State!

    

Down with the laws that are preventing the representative assembly of
the people from becoming the legislative power!? Why are they conducting a
thousand times smaller campaign for a general amnesty, for complete freedom
and for universal suffrage than they are conducting for ministerial jobs? Have
you thought about this? No, you have not. The Cadets are knocking at the back
door in the first place because they don’t want complete freedom
(recall their Public Meetings Bill); they don’t want the complete
abolition of the Council of State (remember the Upper Chamber in their
programme), to which they will also be responsible, and to the same
extent as to the Duma, and so forth. The Cadets do not want to
demand that the government should first grant a general amnesty,
first abolish the Council of State, first introduce complete
freedom, first grant universal, etc. suffrage, and only then
appoint them as Cabinet Ministers. Why don’t the Cadets want to do this? Because
they know what’s what; but the yes-men of the Cadets do not.


The Cadets say: When we become Ministers then we will fight
for all these liberties! It can’t be done at once, you know. And their yes-men
believe them, and do their best


The Cadets know that the Cabinet Minister will be responsible to the old,
police, Russian laws; responsible to the Duma, to the camarilla and to the
Council of State. And so the Minister will say in the suavest tones: I would
only be too glad; I am with you heart and soul; but, you see, “the
others” don’t agree; and the Council of State is still a bit stubborn, you
know. Have patience, gentlemen. I am a Cadet, and nobody can touch the
conscience of the camarilla, or of the Council of State, better than the Cadets,
I assure you.


Remember this, my dear yes-men; to combat the treacherous tactics of the Cadets
what is required is not to echo the Cadets, but to preserve complete
independence, that is to say, to warn the proletariat and the peasants
not to trust the Cadets, not to repeat the Cadet slogans. Your tactics are
hindering the independent struggle of the working class and
revolutionary peasantry. You are selling our revolutionary birthright for a
mess of Cadet reformist pottage.


There is no need for us to explain in such detail the third lie, viz.,
that the appointment of Cadet Ministers by the

    

camarilla marks a “decisive change”, the transition to a
      “real constitution”. Our readers themselves will understand
      that the fact that Trepov appoints Rodichev as a Cabinet Minister does not
      even change the written constitution. To speak of a change of the
    real constitution as the result of such an appointment is to allow
    your tongue to run away with you.


In our next issue we shall examine another current argument, namely:
“After all, a Cadet Cabinet will be better. We have nothing else to choose
from. We must support what is better.” We shall see whether this is a sound,
Social-Democratic argument.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]

The Fifth Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of
Poland and Lithuania was held June 5-12 (18-25), 1906 in Zakopane
(Galicia), attended by 52 delegates with the right to speak and vote and 8
consultative delegates. Among the delegates was V. V. Vorovsky representing the
editorial board of the newspaper Vperyod. The report of the Executive
Committee of the Party was delivered by F. E. Dzerzhinsky (at the Congress he
used the name Frankovsky). The main resolutions of the Congress were printed in
Ekho, No. 4 of June 25 (July 8), 1906.





[2]

The Conference of the St. Petersburg Organisation of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party was held in Terioki (Finland) on June 11-12
(24-25), 1906. It was convened by the St. Peters burg Committee for formulating
the tactics of the St. Petersburg proletariat towards the State Duma. The
elections at the Conference were preceded by a discussion of two tactical
platforms: the Menshevik resolution of the Central Committee supporting the
slogan of a Duma Cabinet and the Bolshevik resolution of the St. Petersburg
Committee (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 481-482).


The Conference was attended by about 80 delegates, who represented some 4,000
members of the Party. Lenin delivered a re port on behalf of the St. Petersburg
Committee. He was opposed by Dan, who defended the standpoint of the Central
Committee. A resolution approving the line of the St. Petersburg Committee was
adopted by a majority of votes.


The resolution adopted on Lenin’s report on Party unity pointed out that the
Central Committee expressed only the opinion of a minority of the Party and put
forward the demand that a new Party congress should be convened to decide the
situation created in the Party. The Conference decided to establish a permanent
liaison between the St. Petersburg Party organisation and the Social-Democratic
Group in the Duma.





[3]

The Moscow Regional Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.
(Conference of the Northern Committees) took place in the first half of June
1906. It was attended by representatives of the committees of Moscow, Moscow
District, Vologda, Yaroslavl, Kineshma, Kostroma, Vladimir District,
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Borisoglebsk, Nizhni Novgorod, Oral, Kozlov, and the
Social-Democratic group of the

   

town of Shuya. The Conference represented 14,000 organised workers.


The Conference condemned the tactics of the Menshevik Central Committee, which
had expressed support for the demand for a Duma Cabinet, and adopted the
following resolution: “The Northern Union declares that it is not in
agreement with the platform of the Central Committee, since it does not
consider this platform to be in accord with the directives of the Party
Congress, and it proposes that support be given to the extreme
Left in the Duma” (Ekho, No. 3, June 24, 1906). The Conference
proposed that the extreme Left in the Duma should appeal to the people through a
manifesto, in which it would “explain all the weakness of the Duma, and
its total inability to achieve anything, and call upon the people to prepare for
independent action” (ibid.).

“We must choose”—this is the argument the opportunists have always
used to justify themselves, and they are using it now. Big things cannot be
achieved at one stroke. We must fight for small but achievable things. How do we
know whether they are achievable? They are achievable if the majority of the
political parties, or of the most “influential” politicians, agree
with them. The larger the number of politicians who agree with some tiny
improvement, the easier it is to achieve it. We must not be utopians and strive
after big things. We must be practical politicians; we must join in the demand
for small things, and these small things will facilitate the fight for
the big ones. We regard the small things as the surest stage in the
struggle for big things.


That is how all the opportunists, all the reformists, argue; unlike the
revolutionaries. That is how the Right-wing Social-Democrats argue about a Duma
Cabinet. The demand for a constituent assembly is a big demand. It can not be
achieved immediately. By no means everyone is consciously in favour of this

       demand.[1]

But the whole State Duma, that is to say, the vast majority of
politicians—that is to say “the whole people”—is in
favour of a Duma Cabinet. We must choose—between the existing
evil and a very small rectification of it, because the largest number
of those who are in general dissatisfied with the existing evil are in favour
of this “very small” rectification. And by achieving the small
thing, we shall facilitate our struggle for the big one.


We repeat: this is the fundamental, the typical argument of all opportunists
all over the world. To what conclusion

    

    does this argument inevitably lead? To the conclusion that we need no
    revolutionary programme, no revolutionary party, and no revolutionary
    tactics. What we need are reforms, nothing more. We do not need a
    revolutionary Social-Democratic Party. What we need is a party of
    democratic and socialist reforms. Indeed, is it not clear that there will
    always be people who admit that the existing state of affairs is
    unsatisfactory? Of course, always. Is it not also clear that the
    largest number of discontented people will always be in
    favour of the smallest rectification of this unsatisfactory
    situation? Of course, always. Consequently, it is our duty, the duty of
    advanced and “class-conscious” people, always to
    support the smallest demands for the rectification of an
    evil. This is the surest and most practical policy to pursue; and all talk
    about “fundamental” demands, and so forth, is merely the talk of
    “utopians”, merely “revolutionary
    phrase-mongering”. We must choose—and we must always
    choose between the existing evil and the most moderate of the schemes in
    vogue for its rectification.


That is exactly how the German opportunist Social-Democrats argued. They said,
in effect! There is a social-liberal trend which demands the repeal of the
anti-socialist laws, a reduction of the working day, insurance against illness,
and so on. A fairly large section of the bourgeoisie supports these demands. Do
not repel it by tactless conduct, offer it a friendly hand, support it, and then
you will be practical politicians, you will achieve small, but real benefits for
the working class, and the only thing that will suffer from your tactics will be
the empty words about “revolution”. You cannot make a revolution
now, in any case. One must choose between reaction and reform, between
the Bismarck policy and the “social empire” policy.


The French ministerial socialists argued exactly like the
Bernsteinians.[2]

They said in effect: We must choose between reaction and the bourgeois
radicals, who promise a number of practical reforms. We must support these
radicals, support their Cabinets; phrases about social revolution are merely
the chatter of “Blanquists”, “anarchists”,
“utopians”, and so forth.


What is the main flaw in all these opportunist arguments? It is that in
fact they substitute the bourgeois theory

    

of “united”, “social” progress for the socialist theory
of the class struggle as the only real driving force of history.
According to the theory of socialism, i.e., of Marxism (non Marxist socialism is
not worth serious discussion nowadays), the real driving force of history is the
revolutionary class struggle; reforms are a subsidiary product of this struggle,
subsidiary because they express unsuccessful attempts to weaken, to blunt this
struggle, etc. According to the theory of bourgeois philosophers, the driving
force of progress is the unity of all elements in society who realise the
“imperfections” of certain of its institutions. The first theory is
materialist; the second is idealist. The first is revolutionary; the second is
reformist. The first serves as the basis for the tactics of the proletariat in
modern capitalist countries. The second serves as the basis of the tactics of
the bourgeoisie.


A logical deduction from the second theory is the tactics of ordinary bourgeois
progressives: always and everywhere support “what is better”; choose
between reaction and the extreme Right of the forces that are opposed to
reaction. A logical deduction from the first theory is that the advanced class
must pursue independent revolutionary tactics. We shall never reduce our tasks
to that of supporting the slogans of the reformist bourgeoisie that are most in
vogue. We pursue an independent policy and put forward only such
reforms as are undoubtedly favourable to the interests of the
revolutionary struggle, that undoubtedly enhance the independence,
class-consciousness and fighting efficiency of the proletariat. Only by such
tactics can reforms from above, which are always half-hearted, always
hypocritical, and always conceal some bourgeois or police snare, be made
innocuous.


More than that. Only by such tactics can real progress be achieved in the matter
of important reforms. This may sound paradoxical, but its truth is confirmed by
the whole history of the international Social-Democratic movement. Reformist
tactics are the least likely to secure real reforms. The most effective
way to secure real reforms is to pursue the tactics of the revolutionary class
struggle. Actually, reforms are won as a result of the revolutionary
class struggle, as a result of its independence, mass force and steadfastness.

    

    Reforms are always false, ambiguous and permeated with the spirit
    of Zubatovism;[3]

they are real only in pro portion to the
    intensity of the class struggle. By merging our slogans with those of the
    reformist bourgeoisie we weak en the cause of revolution and,
      consequently, the cause of reform as well, because we thereby
    diminish the independence, fortitude and strength of the revolutionary
    classes.


Some readers may ask: Why repeat these elementary principles of international
revolutionary Social-Democracy? Our answer is: Because Golos Truda and
many Menshevik comrades tend to forget them.


A Duma, or Cadet, Cabinet is just such a false, ambiguous and Zubatov
reform. To forget the real significance of such a reform, as an attempt on the
part of the Cadets to strike a bargain with the autocracy, means substituting
the liberal-bourgeois philosophy of progress for Marxism. By supporting
such a reform, by including it among our slogans, we
dim the revolutionary consciousness of the proletariat and
weaken its independence and fighting capacity. By up holding our old
revolutionary slogans in their entirety, we strengthen the
actual struggle, and thereby increase the probability of reforms and the
possibility of turning them to the advantage of the revolution, and not
of reaction. All that is false and hypocritical in these reforms we leave to the
Cadets; all that is of positive value in them we utilise
ourselves. Only by such tactics shall we be able to take advantage of the
attempts of the Trepovs and Nabokovs to trip each other up so as to throw both
these worthy acrobats into the pit. Only if we pursue such tactics will history
say about us what Bismarck said about the German Social-Democrats:

“If there were no Social-Democrats there would have been no social
reform.” Had there not been a revolutionary proletariat there would
have been no October 17. Had there been no December,[4]

attempts to prevent the
convocation of the Duma would not have been defeated. We shall have another
December, which will determine the future progress of the revolution....


Postscript. This article had already been written when we read the
leading article in Golos Truda, No. 6. Our comrades are mending their
ways. They now propose that be fore accepting their portfolios, the
Duma Cabinet should

    

demand and secure the abolition of martial law in all parts of the country, the
abolition of secret police, a general amnesty, and the restoration of all
liberties. Very good, comrades. Ask the Central Committee to insert these terms
in its resolution on the Duma Cabinet. In fact, do it yourselves, and then it
will read: before supporting a Duma, or Cadet, Cabinet, we must demand
and secure that the Duma, or Cadets, take the path of
revolution. Before supporting the Cadets we must demand and secure that
the Cadets cease to be Cadets.


 
Notes
 

[1]

Only the minority in the Duma supports this demand.—Lenin
 



[2]

Bernsteinians— representatives of an
anti-Marxist, opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy. The trend
arose at the close of the nineteenth century in Germany and was named after
Eduard Bernstein, the most open exponent of revisionism.





[3]

Zubatovism— the policy of “police
socialism” named after Zubatov, colonel of gendarmerie and chief of the
Moscow Secret Police. In 1901-03 on his initiative legal workers’ organisations

wer 

set up intended to divert the workers from the political struggle against
the autocracy. Zubatov’s activity had the support of B. K. Plehve, Minister of
the Interior. The Zubatovists attempted to direct the working-class movement
towards the achievement of purely economic aims and make the workers believe
that the government was ready to satisfy their demands. The first Zubatov
organisation was set up in Moscow in May 1901 under the title “Society for
Mutual Aid of Workers in the Engineering Industry”. Others were
established in Minsk, Odessa, Wilno, Kiev and other towns.


The reactionary character of Zubatovism was unmasked by the revolutionary
Social-Democrats, who made use of legal workers’ organisations to draw wide
sections of the working class into the struggle against the autocracy. Owing to
the rise of the revolutionary movement in 1903 the tsarist government was
compelled to put an end to the Zubatov organisations.

Yesterday we showed that Trepov had no reason to fall out with the Cadets solely
because he is on principle opposed to compulsory alienation of land for the
benefit of the peasants, once the Cadets agree to the peasants being made to pay
a round sum for the alienated land “at a fair
valuation”. Today, Slovo[1]

says:



“Agrarian reform is the corner-stone of all the rumours about the formation
of a new Cabinet representing the Duma majority. According to the rumours that
have reached us from other sources, the basis on which an agreement may be
reached on the question of forming a Duma Cabinet is—the floating of a new
loan.


“The purpose of the loan is primarily to solve the urgent land
question. It has been estimated that to solve this problem without having to resort
to the undesirable principle of compulsory alienation, two thousand million
rubles will be needed. The other half of the loan is to be placed at the
absolute disposal of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy for the
purpose of increasing the fighting efficiency of the Army and Navy.”



Thus, everything is going smoothly: for two thousand million to compensate the
expropriated landlords and others plus two thousand million to be placed at the
absolute disposal of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy, Trepov is
willing to put the Cadets in power, and let his principles go hang. It is not a
high price he asks, is it, gentle men of the Cadet Party?

 *     *  * 

Nasha Zhizn is very much disturbed at the idea of a new congress of our
Party. It is trying to make out that this new congress will be some sort of
disaster, a symptom of

    

some incurable sickness of the Party. “What, another congress!”—it
cries in horror. Yes, another congress—as the inevitable way out of the
situation in the Party, when the Central Committee and its directives are out of
harmony with the opinion of the whole Party. The Party has now been reorganised
on democratic lines, and we would ask the democrats of Nasha Zhizn how
the organised opinion of a democratic party can be expressed if not through a
congress. In their newspaper these gentlemen quote the figures
published in Ekho[2]

showing the number of organisations and Party members
that have expressed opposition to the Central Committee’s policy; and yet they
are horror-struck at the idea of a congress.


No, the idea of a new congress is not disastrous; it is a symptom of the Party’s
vitality, a symptom of the strength of public opinion in the Party. It is a sign
that the Party is finding a simple and easy way out of the situation that
circumstances have created. And we are sure that nobody in the Party, least of
all our responsible Cabinet—the Central Committee—will regard a
congress as a disaster. For the Party, the convocation of a congress is now a
necessity; for the Central Committee it is an obligation; for the Cadets and
their yes-men, perhaps, it may be unpleasant. But what can one do! We know that
whichever side is victorious at the congress, the congress will be very
unpleasant for the bourgeoisie.

 *     *  * 

The following is printed in Golos Truda (No. 7):



“Editorial note. We have received a letter from Comrade
K. P—v[3]

concerning the article by Comrade N. Rakhmetov. We
deem it necessary to state that we do not fully share some of Rakhmetov’s
views, and in particular, we totally disagree with his opinion about

’a political coalition’ with the Cadets.


“We allowed Comrade Rakhmetov the right freely to express his views. We
ourselves stand by the Amsterdam Resolution,[4]

and we have
made this sufficiently clear and definite in leading articles on the most
diverse topics of current politics from the very first day the
Constitutional-Democratic Party appeared in the political arena.”



We do not know what Comrade K. P—v actually wrote to the editors of
Golos Truda; but the perplexing thought that

    

      involuntarily rises in one’s mind is: Did the editors need this
      letter to enable them to “understand” N. Rakhmetov’s
      article? If they did understand it without Comrade
      K. P—v’s assistance and did not agree with N. Rakhmetov,
      how is it that they publish leading articles on matters of
      principle without indicating that they disagree with them?
      Moreover, the length of the article—interesting indeed
      only because of its slashing style and its “extreme”
      deductions and slogans—must have misled a fairly large
      number of readers who concluded that the author was in close
      touch with leading circles in the Party. Nevertheless, our
      feeling of perplexity is to some extent mingled with a feeling
      of satisfaction. True, it has taken Golos Truda a week
      to dissociate itself from N. Rakhmetov; but better late than
      never.

In a leading article the other day Mysl argued that the Trudovik Group
in the State Duma must not be “split” by the formation of party
groups. The boycott of the Duma, it says, made it a foregone conclusion that the
extreme parties would not have their groups in the Duma. The Trudovik Group
will be far more useful as a non-party organisation working in conjunction with
its local, non-party “supporting groups”.


This argument is utterly false. Non-party revolutionism is a necessary and an
inevitable phenomenon in the period of a bourgeois-democratic revolution. The
Bolshevik Social-Democrats have repeatedly emphasised this. Parties are the
result and the political expression of highly developed class antagonisms. The
characteristic feature of a bourgeois revolution is that these antagonisms are
undeveloped. The growth and expansion of the non-party revolutionary-democratic
element is therefore inevitable in such a revolution.


The Social-Democrats, as the representatives of the class-conscious
proletariat, cannot pledge themselves not to participate in the activities of
the various non-party revolutionary associations. Such for example, were the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, the Peasant Union, and to some extent the
Teachers’ Union, Railwaymen’s Union, etc. We must regard participation in the
activities of such associations as a temporary fighting alliance between the
Social-Democrats and the revolutionary bourgeois democrats. Only if we look at
it in this light can we avoid injury to the vital and fundamental interests of
the proletariat, vindicate the absolutely independent socialist point of view of
the Marxists, and form

    

      independent Social-Democratic Party organisations wherever there is the
      slightest opportunity for doing so.


To regard the formation of such independent Social-Democratic organisations as
“splitting” the non-party revolutionary organisations is to display,
firstly, a purely bourgeois outlook, and secondly, insincerity or shallow
thinking in one’s claim to be non-party. Only bourgeois ideologists can regard
the organisation of socialists in a separate party as a
“split”. Only those who are insincere, i.e., those who have inward
qualms about their own concealed bias for a party, or those who have
not given sufficient thought to the question, can regard the formation of
party organisations as the “splitting” of the non-party
organisations. It is illogical, gentlemen. To be non-party means being neutral
towards the different parties (within the limits of the general aims of
revolutionary democracy). The condemnation of adherence to a party that is
expressed in the word “split”, is a departure from neutrality and
from being non-party and shows obvious bias for a party. You are either
hypocrites, or you cannot think logically, gentlemen. In point of fact your
outcry against splits and in favour of non-party organisation is intended to
cover up your qualms about your own bias for a party. A genuinely
non-party advocate of, let us say, a constituent assembly would not regard it as
a split if some of those who held the same view formed an independent party,
while continuing fully to subscribe to this demand.


Thus, let non-party revolutionaries develop non-party revolutionary
organisations. Good luck to them! But let them stop shouting so much about the
party revolutionaries who, they allege, are “splitting” the
non-party revolutionaries.


Now about the boycott. We are convinced that the boycott was not a blunder. In
the concrete historical situation that prevailed at the beginning of 1906 it was
necessary and correct. After sweeping away the Bulygin Duma, and after December,
it was the duty of the Social-Democrats to continue with equal vigour to hold
aloft the banner of struggle for a constituent assembly and to exert
all efforts to sweep away the Witte Duma too. We performed our
revolutionary duty. And despite all calumnies and the belated repentance

    

of some people, the boycott did a great deal to sustain the revolutionary spirit
and Social-Democratic consciousness of the workers. The best criteria of this
are: 1) the fact that the rank-and-file workers supported it; 2) the brilliant
way in which it was carried out in the particularly oppressed border regions; 3)
the fact that the government issued a special law against the
boycott.[2]


The opinion that the boycott was mistaken and useless is wrong and
short-sighted. It was useful not only from the moral and political, but also
from the immediate and practical point of view. It diverted all the attention
and efforts of the government to the struggle against the boycotters. It put the
government in a ludicrous and idiotic position that was much to our
advantage. The government was compelled to fight for the convocation of
the Duma and as a consequence, it could pay very little attention to the
composition of the Duma. The boycott was, to use a military term, a frontal attack,
or a feint frontal attack, without which it would have been impossible
to outflank the enemy. This is exactly what happened. We revolutionaries made a
feint frontal attack, of which the government was mortally afraid, so much so
that it passed an incredibly idiotic law. Meanwhile, the liberal bourgeoisie and
the non-party revolutionaries took advantage of this frontal attack, which drew
the main forces of the enemy to the centre, to start a flanking movement. They
got into the enemy’s rear and stealthily made their way into the Duma,
penetrating the enemy camp in disguise.


Everybody behaves after his own kind. The proletariat fights; the bourgeoisie
uses stealth.


Now, too, we put the political responsibility for the Duma that was convened by
the camarilla, that is subordinated to the camarilla, and is haggling with the
camarilla, entirely upon the Cadets. It was our bounden duty to do
this because of the dual nature of the composition and activities of the Duma;
it has something that we must support, and something that we must strenuously
combat. Only bourgeois politicians can forget, or refuse to see, this
duality. Only bourgeois politicians can stubbornly ignore the role of the Duma
as the instrument of a counter-revolutionary deal between the autocracy and the
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie

    

against the proletariat and peasantry. Whether this deal will succeed even
      temporarily, and what its consequences may be, no one can tell at
      present. In the last analysis, this will depend on the strength,
      organisation and political consciousness of the popular movement outside
      the Duma. That the representatives of the class that is capable
    of making such a deal predominate in the Duma, that negotiations for it are
    now in progress, and that the first, tentative steps towards it are being
    taken, are facts. No “denials” by the Cadets, nor the
    silence of the Mensheviks can conceal them.


If that is so—and it certainly is—then it is clear that the
interests of the proletarian class struggle imperatively demanded that the
proletariat should maintain complete political independence. It had to act
differently from the liberal bourgeoisie, which is ready to snatch eagerly at
any sop that is thrown to it. It had to warn the people with all the energy at
its command against the trap that was being contrived by the camarilla. It had
to do all in its power to prevent the convocation of a sham, Cadet,
“representative assembly of the people”. All this it tried to
achieve by means of the boycott.


That is why the arguments of those Right-wing Social-Democrats who, to the
amusement of the bourgeoisie, are now repudiating the boycott and denouncing
their own conduct in the recent past are extremely trivial and
amazingly unhistorical. For after all the Mensheviks, too, were
boycotters; only they wanted to boycott the Duma at a different stage. It is
enough to recall two historical facts,, to forget which would be
unpardonable for a Social-Democrat who attaches any value to his past. The
first fact: the leaflet of the Joint Central Committee of our Party,
which consisted of an equal number of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, plainly stated
that both sides agreed with the idea of a boycott and disagreed only about the
stage at which it should be carried out. The second fact: not a single
Menshevik in any Menshevik publication advocated going into the Duma; and even
Comrade Plekhanov, who is so “resolute”, did not dare to do so. For
a Social-Democrat to repudiate the boycott is tantamount to distorting the
recent history of the Party.


But does the fact that we boycotted the Duma necessarily mean that we
must not form our Party Group in the Duma?

    

Not at all. The boycotters who, like Mysl, think so, are mistaken. We
were obliged to do—and did—everything in our power to prevent the
convocation of a sham representative body. That is so. But since it has been
convened in spite of all our efforts, we cannot shirk the task of utilising
it. Only bourgeois politicians who care nothing for the revolutionary struggle,
and for the struggle for the complete success of the revolution, can see
anything illogical in this. Let us recall the example of Liebknecht, who
denounced, flayed and spurned the German Reichstag in 1869, but went into the
Reichstag after 1870. Liebknecht fully appreciated the importance of the
revolutionary struggle for a revolutionary and not a treacherously bourgeois
representative assembly of the people. He did not cravenly repudiate his past
actions. He quite rightly said: I did all I could to fight against such a
Reichstag, to fight for the best possible result. The result turned out to be
the worst. I shall be able to make use even of this worst result without
betraying my revolutionary traditions.


Thus, the boycott cannot be used to deduce that we must refrain from utilising
the Duma, or from forming our Party Group in it. The issue is an entirely
different one, namely, that we must exercise the greatest caution (and
this is the issue that the Bolsheviks raised at the Unity Congress, as
anyone can see by reading their draft

      resolution[1]

).

We must consider whether we
can utilise the Duma now by working inside it; whether we have
Social-Democrats who are suit able for this work, and whether the external
conditions are favourable for it.


We think that the answer to these questions is in the affirmative. We have had
occasion to point out minor mistakes our Duma deputies have made, but on the
whole they have adopted a correct position. An alignment has arisen in
the Duma actually corresponding to the revolutionary situation; the
Octobrists and the Cadets on the right, the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks
(or more correctly, the best of the Trudoviks), on the left. We can and must
utilise this alignment to warn the people against the dangerous side of the Cadet
Duma, so as to develop a revolutionary

    

movement not restricted to the Duma, to Duma tactics, to Duma aims, etc. In view
      of this alignment we shall—if we manage things properly—also
      utilise the non-party revolutionary democrats, and at the same time come
      forward definitely and determinedly as a Social-Democratic, proletarian
      party.

The debate in the State Duma on the reports of the Belostok pogrom is drawing
to a close. The government’s crimes have been disclosed with the fullest and in
some cases, one might say, with pedantic accuracy. The unanimity of the State
Duma in condemning the vile conduct of the local and central
authorities seemed to have been complete.
People who are capable of saying that the Duma “combines the struggle of
classes into one struggle” might have exulted over such unanimity.


But as soon as matters reached the stage of practical
conclusions in regard to the measures necessary to combat the vile
crimes of the gang of pogrom-mongers, this sham and superficial unanimity was at
once scattered like dust. It at once became apparent that however much the
“struggle of classes is combined into one struggle” the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat are pursuing essentially different aims in their
struggle for emancipation. The bourgeoisie wants to “censure” the
government so as to be able to set to work itself to subdue the
revolution. The proletariat wants to call upon the people to wage a
revolutionary struggle.


This difference was clearly revealed in the two resolutions that were proposed
in connection with the Belostok pogrom. The formula of the bourgeoisie (the
Constitutional-Democratic Party):

1) trounces the government;

2) demands the resignation of the Cabinet; and

3) emphasises that “the
government is conscious of its powerlessness to combat the
revolution”. The bourgeoisie wants a strong government to
combat the revolution.

 

The formula of the proletariat (the Social-Democratic Party) is different. It:

1) trounces the government—it is to this
    “unanimity” of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie that
    simpletons in politics usually confine their attention;

2) declares that
    “the only way to protect the lives and property of citizens
    is by arming the people itself”;

3) “calls upon the
    people to take the protection of their lives and property into
      their own hands”, and to “resist national
    persecution”.


These two different formulas clearly reveal the difference in the
interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie wants
to extinguish the revolution. The proletariat wants to arm the revolution. The
bourgeoisie is longing to impeach the bureaucrats. The proletariat is appealing
to the justice of the people (“these criminals and their
protectors will not elude the justice of the people”—as is stated in
the motion of our Social-Democratic Group in the Duma). The bourgeoisie is
appealing only to the Ministers, appealing to them to yield.
The proletariat is appealing to the people, calling them to arm and
resist.


Our comrades in the Duma have struck the right note on this question. We hope
that they will continue to counter- pose the declarations of the revolutionary
proletariat to the phrase-mongering of the opportunist bourgeoisie as clearly,
distinctly and relentlessly as they have done on this

occasion,

All the newspapers continue to teem with reports about the movement among the
armed forces. It is difficult to calculate now in how many regiments, or
military units, there have been unrest and revolts during the two months of the
Duma’s “work”. In regard to military affairs, too, the notorious
peaceful parliamentary activity which naïve, not always naive, by the way,
bourgeois politicians have invented, has resulted in methods of struggle and
forms of the movement that are by no means peaceful, and by no means
parliamentary.


In publishing facts and reports about the movement among the armed forces, our
liberal-bourgeois press usually uses this material only for the purpose of
intimidating the government. The Cadet newspapers usually argue as follows:

the conflagration is spreading. Look out, beware, gentlemen, members of the
Cabinet. Yield to us before it is too late. And the Cabinet Ministers retaliate
(through the medium of Novoye Vremya and other servile newspapers) by
trying to intimidate the Cadets. They say: Look, gentlemen, the conflagration
is spreading. Come to an understanding with us before it is too late. Both the
Cadets and the government regard the movement among the armed forces as proof of
the necessity of taking immediate measures to extinguish the revolution. Their
short-sighted outlook, which is largely prompted by their selfish interests,
prevents them from seeing that this movement is a most important index of the
real character of our revolution, of its real aims. Both the
Cadets and the government are each pursuing their own selfish interests in the
question of the army. The pogrom-mongers need the army as an instrument for
pogroms. The liberal

    

bourgeoisie needs it to protect the bourgeois monarchy from the
      “excessive” encroachments and demands of the peasants, and
      particularly of the workers. The vulgar, hypocritical and false doctrine
      that “the army must be kept out of politics” is particularly
      convenient for concealing the true designs of the bourgeoisie in this
      field.


But look at the character of the unrest in the armed forces, at the demands the
soldiers are making. Try to regard the soldiers who risk being shot for
“insubordination” as human beings who have their own, independent
interests, as part of the people, as men who are expressing the urgent needs of
certain classes in our society. You will see that these soldiers—who
stand closest to the politically least developed peasantry, who are drilled,
downtrodden and browbeaten by the officers—that these “dumb
brutes” are going immeasurably further in their demands than the
Cadet programmes!


The Cadets, and the Cadet Duma, like to claim that they are voicing the demands
of the people. Many simpletons believe this. But look at the facts. Look at the
demands the broad masses of the people are actually making, at the struggle they
are actually waging, and you will see that the Cadets and the Cadet Duma are
curtailing and distorting the demands of the people.


Look at the facts. The men of the Preobrazhensky Regiment put forward the
demand: support the Trudovik Group in the struggle for land and freedom. Please
note: not sup port the Duma, but support the Trudovik Group; the Group which the
Cadets accused of “grossly insulting” the State Duma by introducing
the Land Bill of the 33 deputies, which proposed to abolish the private
ownership of land![1]

Obviously, the soldiers are going much further than the
Cadets. These “dumb brutes” want more than the enlightened
bourgeoisie....


An infantry regiment in St. Petersburg demanded the following:

“... we
soldiers must be allowed to elect our deputies to the State Duma to voice our
soldiers’ needs.” The soldiers do not want to keep out of politics. The soldiers
do not agree with the Cadets. The soldiers are advancing a demand that obviously
amounts to the abolition of the caste army, of the army that is isolated from
the people, and its replacement by an army of free and equal citizens. Now

    

this is exactly the same thing as the abolition of the standing army and the
arming of the people.


The soldiers in the Warsaw Area are demanding a constituent assembly. They are
demanding freedom of assembly and of association for soldiers
“without the consent or presence of officers”. They are demanding
that “military service be performed in the soldiers’ native
districts”, the right to wear civilian dress when off duty, and the right
to elect soldiers’ representatives to supervise the soldiers’ mess and
to act as judges to try offences committed by soldiers.


Does this in any way resemble the Cadets’ conception of army reform? Or does it
come very close to the institution of a national and fully democratic militia?


The soldiers are voicing the real demands of the people, demands that are common
to the overwhelming majority of the people, far better than those gentlemen, the
enlightened bourgeoisie. The character and the main features of the movement
among the armed forces express far more accurately the essence of the main and
fundamental forms of the struggle for emancipation under present conditions than
the tactics of the Cadets. The movement of the workers and peasants confirms
this even more strongly. Our duty is not to attempt to squeeze this movement
into the narrow limits of paltry Cadet politics, not to degrade it by adapting
it to fit paltry Cadet slogans, but to support, expand and develop it in the
spirit of genuine, consistent, determined and militant democracy.

Land Bill of the 33 Deputies. This “Basic
Land Bill” signed by 33 deputies, mostly Trudoviks, was put forward at the
session of the First State Duma on June 6 (19), 1906. In contrast to the Bill of
the "104", the Bill of the 33 advanced as its main demand immediate and
complete abolition of private ownership of the land. The Duma rejected the Bill
on June 8 (21).


Further details of the Trudovik Land Bills are given on

Those gentlemen, the Cadets, continue innocently to “fail to
understand”. And perhaps the one who most stubbornly of all persists in
“failing to understand” is Mr. Izgoyev. In a tone of injured
innocence he expresses his indignation at “Messrs. the Bolsheviks”
on account of their attacks against the Cadets.



“The party of ’people’s freedom’ will never deceive anybody. Nobody has a
right to demand of it more than is indicated in the programme and tactics that
have been approved by party congresses. The programme and tactics contain no
mention of an armed uprising or the overthrow of the monarchy. The Bolsheviks
must reckon with the party that actually exists; and it is somewhat strange that
they should be angry with people who tell them the truth, and who refuse to act
as they dictate.”



But, Mr. Izgoyev, we are “reckoning with the party that actually
exists”. Do you continue to “fail to understand”? But the matter is
so simple: for a bourgeois party, the programme of the “party of
people’s freedom” is not at all bad. Please note that we are saying this
quite seriously.


There (in the programme, Mr. Izgoyev!) one finds, for example, the
demand for free speech, freedom of assembly, and quite a number of good
things. But this has not prevented the Cadets from drafting repressive Bills
against free speech, against freedom of assembly, and against
the other good things.


Well, now about tactics....


True, party congresses have approved of the tactics of “with a shield, or
on a shield”; “death with glory, or death with shame”. But
outside of congresses, in actual politics, the Cadets’ tactics smack of
something entirely different.

    

You are opposed to an armed uprising? You have a perfect right to be,
gentlemen. But you claim that you are in favour of inflexible, relentless
opposition; you claim that you want power to be transferred to the people
under a monarch who will reign, but not govern. Why then are you
haggling for ministerial portfolios? So you see, Mr. Izgoyev; we
are “reckoning with the party that actually exists”, and
not with one that merely exists on paper. If you were really fighting
on the lines laid down by your programme and tactics, which have been
“approved by party congresses”, we would talk to you in entirely
different terms.


Mr. Izgoyev’s article contains many other curiosities. But speaking generally,
it is the literary property of Comrade A. L—y[1]

and we do not intend to encroach upon it.

In this issue we publish an article by Comrade Khrustalev on the question of
whether it is now opportune to form Soviets of Workers’ Deputies. Needless to
say, the author’s name is a guarantee of his intimate knowledge of the
subject. All St. Petersburg workers are aware of this. They are also aware that at
this particular moment the proletariat in the capital is very keenly interested
in the question whether a Soviet of Workers’ Deputies should be formed.


Under these circumstances, Comrade Khrustalev’s polemic against the decision of
the St. Petersburg Committee of our Party assumes immense importance.


We cannot agree with Comrade Khrustalev. He is quite wrong in defending the idea
of Soviets of Workers’ Deputies in general, and their historical role at the end
of 1905, against the St. Petersburg Committee, as it were. He is wrong in
refusing to place December to the Soviet’s account. We would do so without
hesitation; but we, of course, would place it on the “asset” and not
on the “liability” side. In our opinion, the greatest merit of the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, and the one that is still far from being fully
appreciated, is the militant role they played.


But the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies was a special type of fighting
organisation; and platitudes about the utility of organisation will not help in
the least to throw light on the question of the utility of forming this
special type of organisation at the present moment.

“The
Soviet was the revolutionary parliament of the revolutionary proletariat,”
writes Comrade Khrustalev. Quite right. It is this role, which is by no means
confined to the technique of fighting,

    

that is characteristic of the Soviet. Its functions as the organiser of trade
unions, as the initiator of inquiries, as a Conciliation Board, and so forth,
were quite subsidiary and secondary. One can easily conceive of these functions
being fulfilled without a Soviet. But one can hardly conceive of a general
strike without a mass, non-party, strike committee. The Soviet was called into
being by the requirements of the direct mass struggle, and as an organ
of that struggle. That is a fact. It is this fact alone that explains the
special type of role and the actual significance of the Soviet. And it
is to this fact that the word “militant” in the resolution of the
St. Petersburg Committee refers.


No one would dream of setting up a Soviet of Workers’ Deputies to institute
inquiries, to form trade unions, and so forth. Forming Soviets means forming
organs of the direct mass struggle of the proletariat. These
cannot-be formed at any time; whereas trade unions and political parties are
always and absolutely necessary. They can and should be formed under
all circumstances. It is a profound mistake, therefore, to answer the
St. Petersburg Committee by referring to the importance of organisation in
general. For the same reason it is also a mistake to refer to the fact that all
Social-Democrats support the idea of forming peasant land committees. These
committees are being proposed in connection with the country-wide
discussion of the agrarian reform, in connection with the agrarian
movement that is already growing.


But these committees also may lead to “premature”
action!—says Comrade Khrustalev ironically. The whole point, however, is
that at the present time there is an important difference between peasant
actions and workers’ actions. A broad peasant action cannot be
“premature” at the present time; but a broad workers’ action may be
very much so. The reason for this is clear. In political development the
working class is ahead of the peasantry; and the peasantry has not
yet caught up with the working class in preparedness for nation-wide
revolutionary action. It has been catching up with the working class since
December, and to a large extent as a result of December (no matter what timid
pedants may say who are prone to underestimate the importance of December, or
even to repudiate

December), 
    

It will catch up with the working class still faster with the aid of
    local land committees. It is certainly useful to urge on the rearguard that
    did not succeed in coming to the assistance of the vanguard in the previous
    battle; and there is nothing risky in that. But it is very risky to urge on
    the vanguard which did not get the assistance of the rearguard in the
    previous battle; and we must think very carefully before doing so.


Now it is this peculiar political situation that, in our opinion, Comrade
Khrustalev has not taken into account. He is a thousand times right in his
appraisal of the merits and importance of Soviets in general. But he is wrong in
his estimate of the present situation and of the relation between peasant
actions and workers’ actions. He has apparently forgotten another proposal made
by the St. Petersburg Committee in another resolution, viz., to support the idea
of forming an Executive Committee representing the Left groups in the Duma for
the purpose of co-ordinating the activities of the free organisations of the

       people.[1]

Such a committee could determine more accurately the degree of
readiness and determination of the peasantry as a whole, and consequently put
the question of forming Soviets of Workers’ Deputies on a practical basis. In
other words: the St. Petersburg Committee is now aiming at something more: not
only to form militant organisations of the proletariat, but also to
co-ordinate them with the militant organisations of the peasantry,
etc. The St. Petersburg Committee is postponing the formation of
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies at the present time, not because it fails to
appreciate their enormous importance, but because it is making allowance for
another, new condition for success that is now coming very much to the
fore, namely, joint action of the revolutionary peasants and workers. Thus, the
St. Petersburg Committee is not committing itself, and is not determining the
tactics of the future beforehand. The St. Petersburg Committee is at this
moment advising the vanguard: Do not go into battle, but first of all send
a delegation to the rearguard; tomorrow the rearguard will have drawn up
closer, and the assault

    

on the enemy will be more vigorous; tomorrow we shall be in a position to
issue a more timely slogan for action.


To conclude. Speaking generally, Comrade Khrustalev has advanced very convincing
arguments in favour of forming Soviets. He has appraised their general
importance excellently. His main purpose was to combat those who be little the
role of the Soviets, and the importance of revolutionary actions in general. In
this Comrade Khrustalev was quite right. There are not a few
“belittlers” of this sort, and they are not only to be found among
the Cadets. But Comrade Khrustalev, lacking permanent and close contacts with
the proletariat—owing to the efforts of the hangmen and
pogrom-mongers—has not fully appreciated the present situation
and the present “disposition” of the revolutionary
forces. Today, the vanguard must concentrate attention not on immediate
action, but on consolidating and extending the closest contacts with the
rearguard and with all the other units.

In June 1906 the Socialist-Revolutionaries began a campaign for reviving the
St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers’ Deputies. The Mensheviks supported this idea,
the Bolsheviks opposed it. On June 21 (July 4), 1906, the St. Petersburg
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. adopted a resolution which, after pointing out the
militant significance of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, noted that its
re-establishment was untimely and exposed the provocative nature of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries’ agitation. This resolution (published in
Ekho, No. 5, July 27, 1906) was widely discussed at meetings and was
approved by the overwhelming majority

   

of the workers. The Menshevik G. S. Khrustalev-Nosar, who bad been president
of the St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers’ Deputies in October-November 1905,
opposed the resolution of the St. Petersburg Committee and defended the S.-R.’s
campaign.

Our observations in Ekho, No. 9, on the historical role of the boycott
and on the significance of non-party revolutionary

    organisations[1]

have evoked
characteristic replies from the extreme Right and the extreme Left wing of the
bourgeois democrats.


As was to be expected, Mysl was offended by our use of the term
“bourgeois democrats” and angrily evades the main issue. It writes:



“Ekho even finds ’bourgeois democrats’ in the ’Soviets of
Workers’ Deputies’, which are purely proletarian class organisations.... One can
hardly go further than that.”



You radical gentlemen must remember that most of the Soviets of Workers’
Deputies did not remain “purely proletarian”. They very often
accepted delegates from soldiers, sailors, office employees and peasants. Would
it not be better to tell us candidly why you don’t like the term
“bourgeois democrats” instead of avoiding disagreements by
quibbling?


Rech is quite beside itself with rage. In their opening remarks against
us the Cadets handle us with kid gloves, as it were, “not desiring to say
anything offensive”. What perfect gentlemen! But towards the end these
Cadets swear like ... like troopers. Our appraisal of the boycott is dubbed
“clownish, or impenetrable stupidity”. Oh, what gentlemen these
Cadets are!


Rech writes:

 


“At all events, let us place on record that the object of the
    Bolshevik tactics was to fight for the convocation of the Duma. And the
    object of all this beating the breast and shouting about the necessity of a
    boycott was to mislead the government.”



Stop joking, gentlemen! You know perfectly well that our idea was quite
different. The object of the boycott was to sweep away the Witte Duma, just as
the Bulygin Duma was swept away. Although it failed to achieve its own,

i. e., 

its direct and immediate object, the boycott nevertheless was
indirectly of advantage in that, among other things, it distracted the
attention of the government. In this case, too, as always, revolutionary tactics
were the best means of developing the class-consciousness and fighting
efficiency of the proletariat, and of indirectly ensuring the achievement of
half-hearted reforms in the event of failure to achieve complete victory.

It has long been known that the reactionaries are bold and that the liberals are
cowards.


New confirmation of this ancient truth is provided by the Cadets’ draft of the
State Duma’s appeal to the people on the question of the land. Unfortunately,
the Trudoviks’ draft is no better than that of the Cadets. This time the
Trudoviks are quite helplessly trailing behind the liberal bourgeoisie. But
there are the Social-Democrats in the Duma; will they not come to the rescue?


Recall how this question of the State Duma appealing to the people arose. In its
reply to the address from the throne the State Duma expressed itself in favour
of the compulsory alienation of the private estates for the benefit of the
peasantry. The Goremykin Cabinet concisely, clearly and with magnificent firmness
and determination answered: “Impermissible.”


But the Cabinet did not confine itself to this gruff, police-official
refusal. No, the Cabinet Ministers have learned something from the
revolution. The Cabinet Ministers do not intend to confine their duties to
making formal replies to formal questions of the Duma. The reactionaries are not
formalists, they are practical men. They know that the real power is not the
Duma, but the people. They want to carry their propaganda to the
people. Without wasting precious time, they forthwith drew up an appeal
to the people. It was this government communication (of June 20) that
suggested the idea of the Duma appealing to the people. The government showed
the way, the Duma trailed behind the government, as it was incapable of being
the first to take a course worthy of a genuine representative assembly of the
people.

 

How was the government’s communication framed? Like a real fighting manifesto of
the reactionary monarchist party. Oh, the reactionaries are not bashful in the
least! They know how to write in militant terms. In their
“communication” they plainly speak in the name of the
government. Indeed,
why should they stand on ceremony? The liberal professors claim that we are
living under a constitutional system and that the Duma is also a part of the
government. Let the professors chatter! Let them amuse the people with their
constitutional antics! We reactionaries are practical men. We know that, in
fact, we are the government. We say so plainly. As for the quibbles and
formalism of these liberal pedants, we don’t care a fig for them. We say
plainly and openly: peasants, you don’t know what is good for you. Compulsory
alienation is no good to you; and we, the government, will not allow
it. All the peasant talk about the land is lies and deception. It is the
government that takes most care of the peasants. Even now it is ready to offer
them sops. But the peasants have got to understand that they can not expect
improvements to come from “sedition and violence”; they can be
obtained only by “peaceful labour” (they should have added: for the
landlords) and as a result of the constant care our autocratic government takes
of the peas ants.


Such was the gist of the government’s communication. It is an actual declaration
of war on the revolution. It is an actual manifesto of the reactionary autocracy
saying to the people: We shall tolerate no nonsense! We shall crush you!


And now the Cadets, and the Trudoviks who this time are in complete captivity to
them, have set about answering the government’s challenge. The draft replies of
the Cadets and the Trudoviks have been published today. What a miser able, truly
pitiful impression these two drafts create!


The reactionary camarilla does not hesitate to break the law and to declare that
what is formally only a small part of the government is the real and
entire government. The Cadets and Trudoviks like Shchedrin’s
sapient gudgeons,[1]

take shelter in the reeds of the law. They are hitting us with
lawlessness, say these snivelling “people’s”, if you
please, representatives, but we are defending ourselves with the law!
The Duma, acting in accordance with the law,

    

    expresses itself in favour of compulsory alienation. According to the law
    “no proposal of the government can come into force” without
    the consent of the Duma. We, in accordance with the law, have appointed a
    committee, a big one, of 99 members[2]....

    This committee is
    drafting “a carefully considered and properly framed
    law”.... Let the people “peace fully and quietly await the
    conclusion of the work of promulgating this law” (the Trudoviks
    deleted this utterly, indecently abject concluding sentence! Their
    consciences pricked them. But they inserted instead a statement about
    organising “local land institutions”, treacherously
    remaining silent about the fact that the Duma, in other words, its
    Cadet majority, avowedly wants these institutions to be landlord and
    bureaucratic organisations).


For shame, gentlemen, representatives of the people! It is disgraceful for you
to pretend that you do not under stand what every Russian muzhik even in the
remotest village now understands, namely, that in Russia today there is a wide
gulf between laws on paper and the facts of life; that it is impossible
for the transfer of all the land to the peasants and complete freedom for all
the people to be achieved by the peaceful means of allegedly-constitutional and
strictly legal efforts. If you lack the courage to write as firmly as the
camarilla, and to utter your revolutionary truth as candidly, in answer to its
reactionary truth, you should not have undertaken to reply to the
Cabinet. The laws governing the Duma do not provide for an appeal to the
people. That being so, oh wise men of the law, keep to your
“interpellations” and do not meddle in a field where you have
neither the courage, nor the straightforwardness, nor the ability to compete
with the reactionaries, who are practical men and know how to fight!


And if you do draw up an appeal to the people you must write the truth, the
whole truth, the bitter and unvarnished truth. You must say to the people:


Peasants! The Cabinet has issued its appeal to you. The Cabinet Ministers do not
want to give you either land or freedom. The Cabinet Ministers brazenly speak in
the name of the whole government; they speak against the Duma, although on paper
the Duma is supposed to be part of the government.

 

Peasants! The Cabinet Ministers are in actual fact the autocratic government of
Russia. They don’t care a fig for your people’s representatives in the Duma;
they jeer at them and delay everything by their police-lawyer quibbling. They
mock at the demands of the people and, as if nothing had happened, continue
their policy of murder, violence, plunder and pogroms.


Peasants! You must know that the Duma is powerless to give you land and
freedom. The Duma is tied hand and foot by the laws of the police
government. You must secure that the representatives of the people have full
power, all the power of the state, in their hands. Do you want land and freedom?
If you do, then secure the convocation of a national constituent assembly,
secure the complete abolition of the old regime all over the country, secure
complete freedom of elections!


Peasants! Know that you will never be free unless you free yourselves. The
workers understood this, and by their struggles compelled the government to
yield the concessions of October 17. And you, too, must understand
it. Only when you do so will you be a revolutionary people, that is, a people
that knows what it must fight for, a people that knows how to fight, a people
that knows how to vanquish its oppressors. Utilise your deputies in the Duma,
those who represent you in the Duma; unite more closely and solidly all over
Russia and prepare for a great struggle. Without a fight you will get neither
land nor freedom. Without a fight you will have ruinous redemption payments
forcibly foisted upon you; you will have foisted upon you land committees
consisting of landlords and bureaucrats who will deceive and rob you as they
did in 1861.[3]


Peasants! We are doing all we can for you in the Duma. But you must complete the
job yourselves if you really want conditions in Russia to be different from what
they are now, even though there is a Duma.

 *     *  * 

But it would be ridiculous to propose such an appeal in the Duma.


But would it? Is it not more ridiculous to write “appeals to the
people” in the stilted language of the hidebound Russian

    

      lawyers that the Cadets and (to their shame be it said) the Trudoviks use?
      Do the people exist for the Duma, or does the Duma exist for the people?
      Is freedom to exist for the Duma, or is the Duma to serve the cause of
      freedom?

 *     *  * 

Let the Cadets’ appeal, the Trudoviks’ appeal and our appeal be read
at any peasant meeting! We will hear what the peasants say in answer
to the question: Who is right?

cowardly philistine in a story by the Russian satirist M. Y. Saltykov-Shchedrin.

This refers to the Agrarian Committee of the First State Duma set up
to draft a Bill on the land question. On June 6 (19), 1906, at the 22nd session
of the Duma, 91 members of the Committee were chosen (the Cadets predominating
among them, with 41 persons). Afterwards, in accordance with a decision that
was adopt ed, the Committee was supplemented by a further eight members (3 from
the Caucasus, 3 from Siberia and 2 from Central Asia). The chairman of the
Agrarian Committee was a Cadet, A. A. Mukhanov.





[3]

This refers to the “Peasant Reform” which
abolished serfdom in Russia in 1861. The Reform was made necessary by the entire
course of Russia’s economic development and by the growth of a mass movement
among the peasantry against feudal exploitation. It was a bourgeois reform
carried out by the serf-owning land lords. Landlordism was preserved. The
peasant could receive an allotment of land only according to the quota
established by law (and with the agreement of the landlord), and had to make a
redemption payment for it. Approximate estimates show that after the Reform, the
nobility possessed 71,500,000 dessiatines of land and the peasants 33,700,000
dessiatines. The Reform enabled the landlords to cut off and appropriate
one-fifth or even two-fifths of the lands formerly cultivated by the
peasants. The landlords remained in possession of the best parts of the
peasants’ allotments (the “cut-off lands”, woods, meadows, watering
places, grazing-grounds, and so on), without which the peasants could not engage
in independent farming.


The peasants’ redemption payments for their allotments of land amounted in fact
to direct

spoliation 

of the peasants by the landlords and the tsarist
government. The period during which the peasants made their redemption payments
to the tsarist government was fixed at 49 years with interest at 6 per cent. The
arrears of redemption payments due increased from year to year. Redemption
payments made to the tsarist government merely by peasants formerly under
landlords amounted to 1,900 million rubles, whereas the market price of the land
which passed into the hands of the peasants did not exceed 544 million
rubles. In actual fact the peasants were made to pay hundreds of millions of
rubles for their land, which led to the ruin of the peasant farms and
mass impoverishment of the peasants.



V. I. Lenin called the “Peasant Reform” of 1861 the first mass act
of violence against the peasantry in the interests of nascent capitalism
      in agriculture—the landlords were “clearing the estates”
      for capitalism. For material on the 1861 Reform see V. I. Lenin’s
      “The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Downfall of Serfdom”,
      “The Jubilee” “The ’Peasant Reform’ and
      Proletarian-Peasant Revo lution” (Collected Works, 4th
      Russ. ed., Vol. 17).

Yesterday’s debate in the Duma on the appeal to the people provides extremely
valuable material for the political education of the broad masses.


The question of appealing to the people proved to be such a vital one that the
intrinsic nature of the different political parties was revealed with a clarity
that left nothing to be desired. On this question the Duma found itself as if in
a vice between the reactionary autocracy (“the government’s
communication”) and the revolutionary people, whose struggle outside the Duma
forced itself, one might say, through every chink and crevice of the
Taurida Palace.[2]

From the moment it opened, the debate irresistibly swung
over from formalities and details to the very core of the question.


Why appeal to the people? This is the question that eminently confronted the
Duma. It coloured the whole debate. It raised the whole debate to the plane on
which we formulated the question in yesterday’s leading

       article,[1]

i.e., the
issue became: To reply to the fighting statement of the Cabinet with a lighting
statement of the Duma? To make no reply at all? Or to try to smooth out
differences and soften the acuteness of the issue, an acuteness created by life
it self.


The battle was opened by the Right wing in the Duma. The Right-wing Cadet
Petrazhitsky, tried to secure the adjournment of the debate. Naturally the
Octobrists supported this Bight-wing Cadet. It became obvious that the counter
revolution was afraid of the Duma appealing to the people.

 

By its definite stand the reaction helped to rally the whole Left wing of the
      Duma. The proposal to adjourn the debate was defeated. The debate itself
      very distinctly revealed the three main trends in the Duma. The
      “Rights” (the Octobrists and a section of the Cadets) were in
      favour of “pacifying” the peasant movement and therefore
    opposed to any appeal. The “Centre” (the Cadets and
    probably the majority of the non-party deputies) were in favour of
    “pacifying” the peasant movement and were therefore in
      favour of issuing a pacifying appeal. The “Left”
    trend (the Trudoviks, evidently only, a section of them, and the Social-
    Democrats) were in favour of explaining to the people that they
    cannot “wait peacefully and passively”, and were
    therefore in favour of a revolutionary and not a
    “pacifying” appeal.


The views of this last trend were most vividly expressed by the Trudovik
Zhilkin, the Polish deputy Lednitsky and the Social-Democrat
Ramishvili. “The people are clinging to their last, almost childish,
hopes,” said Zhilkin. “I am not speaking about peace, order and
tranquillity; I am speaking about the organised struggle against the old
regime.... Did the State Duma come into being as the result of peace and
tranquillity?” And, recalling the October struggle, the speaker, amidst the
applause of the Left, exclaimed: “It is due to these ’disorders’ that we
are here today.” “In this general sense,” rightly said the speaker,
“the committee’s draft of the appeal to the people is very
unsatisfactory” (but he should have added: the Trudoviks’ draft is also
unsatisfactory for it does not contain the ideas and theses that Zhilkin
outlined in his speech). “We must emphasise and at the end express the idea
that not peace and tranquillity, but unrest in the good and grand sense of the
term can organise the masses....


Lednitsky even employed one of the sharpest expressions that we employed
yesterday, and said that the proposed appeal was “pitiful”.
And Ramishvili, protesting “against calling upon the people to wait
peacefully and quietly for a solution of the problem”, declared:
“The revolutionary path is the only true path” (we are
quoting from the report in Nasha Zhizn). He also urged that the Duma
should say that the land must be transferred without redemption payments.

 

Most of the Cadet and “non-party” speakers were in favour of a
“pacifying” appeal; they condemned the taking of revolutionary steps
(Kotlyarevsky answering Lednitsky) and argued that an appeal was useful
“from the point of view of the landowners” (the Cadet Yakushkin).


The Black Hundred Volkonsky, backed by Skirmunt and the Right Cadet
Petrazhitsky, argued that the appeal was “dangerous” and likely to
ignite the flames of revolution; and he referred to the law in
accordance with which the Land Bill had to be passed by the Duma, then sent to
the Council of State, etc., etc., etc.


The trends were excellently delineated. Once again it was revealed that the
Cadets are vacillating between reaction and revolution; between the old regime
and the people. Once again events have proved how short-sighted and stupid are
the tactics of “supporting the Cadets”, tactics which can only
weaken the revolutionary position of the Social-Democrats and the revolutionary
democrats in the Duma. Once again events have proved that by acting
independently the Social-Democrats can win over to their side a section of the
Trudoviks and to some extent even split the Cadets.


The political situation itself is irresistibly determining the tactics of the
Social-Democratic Party. In spite of the efforts of the Right-wing
Social-Democrats, up to now there has not resulted any support of the
Cadets, but what has resulted, fortunately, is an independent policy of the
proletariat backed by a section of the peasant deputies. The outcome has not
been the artificial division, invented by the opportunists: the Rights versus
the combined Cadets, Trudoviks and Social-Democrats. The outcome has been a
revolutionary division: the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks against
the Rights, with the Cadets swaying like reeds.


Unfortunately, our Social-Democratic deputies did not take full advantage of the
extremely favourable situation. During the general debate they should certainly
have introduced their own Social-Democratic draft of an appeal to the
people. Only in that case would their policy have been definitively and
completely the independent policy of the representatives of the
class party of the proletariat, as the vanguard of the
revolution. Only in that case would the correct ideas expressed by Ramishvili,
Zhilkin and Lednitsky not

    

have been submerged in the debate, but would have been combined, fixed and
      formulated in a clear and resolute platform of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy.


We can only express the wish that our Social-Democratic Group in the Duma will
learn the lessons of the groupings that are more and more often occurring in the
Duma, and more resolutely pursue an absolutely, independent proletarian policy;
that when the draft appeal is discussed para graph by paragraph they will at
least to some extent rectify matters by proposing their own independent
amendments couched in consistently revolutionary terms.


A Social-Democratic draft of an appeal to the people, even if it remains only a
draft read in the Duma, will have an extremely valuable effect in uniting and
developing the revolutionary struggle, and will win over to the side of
Social-Democracy the finest elements of the revolutionary peasantry.

The newspaper Rossiya[1]

is subsidised by the
pogrom-mongers’ government as a vehicle for the views of this government.


In connection with the Duma’s draft appeal to the people this government
newspaper is adopting a very threatening tone. It wants to intimidate the Duma
by showing that the proposed course of action is illegal as well as
“irrational”, “revolutionary”, etc. Today the Cadet
Rech has completely changed front and is pronouncing against the
appeal, obviously frightened by the threats emanating from the press that
cringes before the government.


And there are threats in abundance. Rossiya today writes as follows on
the subject of a Cadet Cabinet: “If it had been suggested to Vladimir
Krasnoye Solnyshko that the administration of Rus should be entrusted to
Solovei the Robber as a way of ensuring order, he would probably have proposed a
simpler way—by putting an end to Solovei the Robber with the
help of Ilya Muromets.[2]
That, as is well known, proved ejective."


This Ilya Muromets who is preparing to “put an end” to the
revolution in Russia turns out to be no other than the international army of
counter-revolution. In an article “The Foreign Powers and the
Situation in Russia” (Rossiya, No. 170) the government newspaper,
not from naivety but with the same aim of intimidation, expounds the
problem of active intervention by foreign powers in Russian internal affairs.


This exposition of the government sheet is highly instructive and useful. The
international counter-revolution is

    

paying close attention to Russia, is rallying and preparing forces against her
      “in case of need”. “The imperial German Government,”
      writes Rossiya, “is fully aware of this situation [viz.,
    that “the present state of affairs in Russia is primarily the result
    of the influence of revolutionary elements abroad"I and, consequently, it
    has taken a number of appropriate measures which will not fail to have the
    desired results.”


These measures consist in preparing the armed forces of Germany, together with
Austria, for an invasion of Russia if the cause of freedom triumphs or is about
to triumph. The Berlin Government has already communicated with the Austrian
Government on this matter. Both of them have recognised that “under
certain conditions active intervention in the internal affairs of Russia with
the aim of suppressing or limiting this [i. e., the revolutionary] movement
might be desirable and useful”. At the same time it was established that
intervention required a direct and clearly expressed wish on the part of the
Russian Government.


Three army corps have been concentrated in Austria, in Galicia, and on the
Russian frontier, where it is feared that there is a possibility also of the
spread of an agrarian movement of the Russian type. On June 26, the Governor of
Galicia, who is also a Russian landlord, even issued a proclamation warning the
population that all disturbances would be suppressed with the utmost severity.


Hence there can be no doubt about the conspiracy of the international
counter-revolution. The Russian Government is calling on the aid of foreign
troops against the Russian people. Negotiations about this have been conducted
and will be conducted, and they have already led to a quite definite agreement.


Let the workers and peasants know then that the government is betraying the
country in order to ensure the rule of the gang of pogrom-mongers. So it was and
so it always will be. History teaches us that the ruling classes have always
been ready to sacrifice everything, absolutely everything:

religion, liberty and homeland, if it was a question of crushing a revolutionary
movement of the oppressed classes.

    

There is not the slightest doubt that the Russian pogrom mongering rulers too
will act in the same way and that they are already preparing to do so.


But the workers and peasants should not be afraid of such action. The Russian
Government has its international reserve: the reactionary governments of
Germany, Austria and other countries. But we too have our powerful
international reserve: the socialist proletariat of Europe, organised in the three
million-strong party in Germany, in the powerful parties of all the European
countries. We welcome the appeal of our government to the international reserve
of reaction: such an appeal will, in the first place, open the eyes of the most
ignorant people in Russia and do us a valuable service by destroying faith in
the monarchy, and, in the second place, such an appeal will better than anything
else extend the basis and field of action of the Russian revolution by
converting it into a world revolution.


All right, Mr. Trepov & Co.! Open fire! Call on your Austrian and German
regiments against the Russian peasants and workers! We are for an extension of
the struggle, we are for an international revolution!

 *     *  * 

But in appraising the general significance of the international
conspiracy the petty, partial aims of the Russian pogrom-mongers
should not be overlooked. We have already pointed out that the articles in
Rossiya were not due to naivety. Mysl is mistaken in thinking
so. It is not “naivety”, not “cynicism”, and not
“garrulity”. It is a calculated threat to the Cadets. The
pogrom-mongers’ government is afraid of a Duma manifesto to the people and
threatens the Cadets:

“Don’t dare to do it! If you do, I shall dissolve the Duma and call on the
Austrian and German regiments! I have already made preparations.”


The Cadet simpletons have already shown the white feather and basely turned
back, as today’s Rech has shown. It suffices to threaten the
Cadets—and the Cadets are ready to retreat....

 

The proletariat is not frightened by the wretched threats of the pogrom-mongers’
      government. The proletariat maintains its independent fighting
    position and does not allow itself to be scared by the bogey of a frightened
    Cadet.


Once more: Open fire, Mr. Trepov! Extend the revolutionary field of battle! The
international proletariat will not
be found wanting!

The pamphlet The Dissolution of the Duina and the Tasks of the
Proletariat, written by Lenin before the start of the Sveaborg uprising,
was published only after the uprising. On August 12 (25), 1906 in Moscow an
order for confiscation of the pamphlet was issued and court proceedings were
taken against the author. Nevertheless, the pamphlet had a wide distribution not
only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but also in the provinces.

Lenin: 1906/dissolut: I







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Dissolution of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat


The dissolution of the Duma confronts the workers’ party with a number of
      questions of very great importance. Let us note the foremost of
      these:

(1)
      the general estimate of this political event in the course of our
      revolution;

(2) the definition of the content of the further struggle and
      of the slogans under which it must be carried on;

(3) the definition of
      the form of this future struggle;

(4) the choice of the moment for the
      struggle, or, more correctly, an appraisal of the conditions that could
      help in the correct choice of the moment.


We shall deal briefly with these questions.

    

I

The dissolution of the Duma has most strikingly and clearly confirmed the views
of those who warned against being obsessed with the external
“constitutional” aspect of the Duma and, if one may so express it,
with the constitutional surface of Russian politics during the second quarter
of 1906. Experience has now exposed the hollowness of the “mighty
words” so volubly uttered by our Cadets (and Cadetophiles) before the
Duma, about the Duma and in connection with the Duma.


Note this interesting fact: the Duma has been dissolved on strictly
constitutional grounds. It has not been “dispersed”. There has
been no infringement of the law. On the contrary, it has been done strictly in
accordance with the law, as under any “constitutional monarchy”. The
supreme power has dissolved the Chamber on the basis of the
“constitution”. On the basis of such-and-such an article, the present
“Chamber” has been dissolved, and by the same ukase
(rejoice,

    

you legalists!) new elections, or the date of convening a new Duma, have been
      authorised.


But this is the very thing that has at once exposed the illusory character of
the Russian constitution, the fictitious nature of our native parliamentarism,
which the Left-wing Social-Democrats so persistently pointed out throughout the
first half of 1906. And now this special character of the Russian constitution
has been admitted, not by “narrow-minded and fanatical”
“Bolsheviks”, but by the most peaceful liberal legalists, and they
have admitted it by their conduct. The Cadets have
admitted it by replying to the dissolution of the Duma by a mass “flight
abroad”, to Vyborg, and by a manifesto which violates the
law;[3]

they have admitted it by replying through articles in the very moderate
Rech, which is forced to admit that in fact it is a matter of
the restoration of the autocracy, and that Suvorin inadvertently blurted out
the truth when he wrote that it was hardly likely he would live to see
another Duma.[4]

All the hopes of the Cadets have suddenly switched from
“constitution” to revolution, and all this happened as the result of
a single, strictly constitutional act of the supreme power. And only yesterday
the Cadets boasted in the Duma that they were the “shield of the
dynasty” and supporters of strict constitutionalism.


The logic of life is stronger than the logic of textbooks on constitutional
law. Revolution teaches.


Everything the “Bolshevik” Social-Democrats have writ ten about the
Cadet victories has been brilliantly confirmed. (Cf. the pamphlet, The
Victory of the Cadets and the Tasks of the Workers’ Party, by

      N. Lenin.[1]

)

All the bias and short-sightedness of the Cadets have become obvious.
Constitutional illusions—that “bogey” the raising of which was the
mark of the die-hard Bolsheviks—are now seen by all to be nothing but
illusions, a phantom, a mirage.


“There is no Duma!” Moskovskiye Vedomosti[5]

and Grazhdanin[6]

cry out in a wild frenzy of delight. “There is
no constitution!” sadly repeat the Cadets, those subtle connoisseurs of our
constitution, who used to quote it so cleverly,

    

to gloat so much over its clauses. The Social-Democrats will neither exult (we
made some use even of the Duma) nor lose heart. The people has gained—they
will say—by’ losing one of its illusions.


Yes, in the person of the Cadet Party, the whole of the Russian people is being
taught a lesson, learning it not from books, but from its own revolution, one
which it itself is making. We said on one occasion that in the person of the
Cadets the people is ridding itself of its first illusions of bourgeois
emancipation, and that in the person of the Trudoviks it is freeing itself of
its last illusions of bourgeois

    emancipation.[2]

The Cadets dreamed of
emancipation from serfdom, tyranny, arrogance, Asiatic despotism, autocracy,
without the overthrow of the old regime. The limited aspirations of the
Cadets have already suffered bankruptcy. The Trudoviks dream of freeing the
masses from poverty, from the exploitation of man by man, without
destroying the commodity economy; they will yet suffer bankruptcy, and in the
very near future too, if our revolution leads to the complete victory of our
revolutionary peasants.


The rapid rise of the Cadet Party, their intoxicating victories at the
elections, their triumph in the Cadet Duma, their sudden collapse from a single
stroke of the pen of the “beloved monarch” (who, one might say, spat
in Rodichev’s face while the latter was assuring him of his love)—all
these are events of serious political significance; they all mark stages in the
revolutionary development of the people. In 1906, the people, i.e., the
broad mass of the population, had not yet, as a mass, grown up so far as to be
consciously revolutionary. The consciousness that the autocracy was intolerable
had become general, and so too had the consciousness of the worthlessness of
the government of bureaucrats and of the need for a representative assembly of
the people. But the people could not yet realise and appreciate that a
representative assembly of the people with power was incompatible with
the continued existence of the old regime. For this, it turned out, a special

    

experience was still needed, the experience of the Cadet Duma.


During its short span of life, the Cadet Duma vividly demonstrated to
the people the difference between a representative assembly of the people
without power and one with power. Our slogan, a constituent
assembly (i.e., a representative assembly of the people with full
power), has been proved to be a thousand times right, but life, i.e., the
revolution, has brought us towards it by a longer and more complex road than we
were able to foresee.


Cast a general glance at the main stages of the great Russian revolution and you
will see how, through experience, the people, step by step, approached
the slogan of a constituent assembly. First we have the period of
“confidence” at the end of 1904. The liberals are in raptures. They
occupy the entire foreground. Some not very steadfast Social-Democrats even
speak of the two main forces of the moment:

the liberals and the government. But the people become imbued with the
idea of “confidence”. On January 9 the people
“confidently” go to the Winter Palace. The period of
“confidence” brings to the front a third force, the
proletariat, and lays the basis for the people’s utter lack of
confidence in the autocratic government. The period of
“confidence” ends by the people refusing to believe the government’s
talk about “confidence”.


The next stage. The Bulygin Duma is promised. Confidence is confirmed by
action. Representatives of the people are being convened. The liberals are in
raptures and call for participation in the elections. The liberal professors, as
befits these “ideological” lackeys of the bourgeoisie, call upon the
students to go on with their studies and not to meddle with revolution. Some not
very steadfast Social-Democrats succumb to the arguments of the liberals. The
people appear on the scene. By the October strike the proletariat sweeps away
the Bulygin Duma and seizes liberty, gaining the Manifesto, which is quite
constitutional in form and content. The people learn by experience that it is
not enough to obtain a promise of liberty, one must also have the strength
to seize liberty.


Next. In December the government annuls the liberties. The proletariat
rises. The first uprising is defeated. But the

    

stubborn and desperate armed fighting in the streets of Moscow makes the
summoning of the Duma unavoidable. The boycott organised by the proletariat
fails. The proletariat proves to be too weak to overthrow the Witte Duma. The
Cadets fill its benches. The representative assembly of the people is an
accomplished fact. The Cadets are in raptures. There is no limit to their cries
of delight. The proletariat waits sceptically.


The Duma begins its work. The people make ten times more use of the slight
extension of liberties than the Cadets. In spirit and determination the Cadet
Duma is at once found to be lagging behind the people. The period of
the Cadet Duma (May and June 1906) proves to be a period of the greatest
successes for the parties to the Left of the Cadets: the Trudoviks
outstrip the Cadets in the Duma; at public meetings the Cadets are censured for
their timidity; the Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary press gains
ground; the revolutionary peasant movement grows stronger; there is unrest in
the army; the proletariat, which had been exhausted by the December events,
recovers. The period of Cadet constitutionalism proves to be the period, not of
a Cadet and not of a constitutional movement, but of a revolutionary movement.


This movement compels the government to dissolve the
Duma. Experience proves that the Cadets are merely “froth”. Their
strength is derived from the strength of the revolution. And to the revolution
the government retaliates by the essentially revolutionary (though in form
constitutional) act of dissolving the Duma.


The people are becoming convinced by experience that a representative
assembly of the people is naught if it does not have full power, if it
is convened by the old regime, if the old regime remains intact side by side
with it. The objective course of events is now bringing to the fore, not the
question of how laws, or the constitution, are to be worded, but the question of
power, of real power. All laws and all deputies are naught if
they possess no power. That is what the Cadet Duma has taught the
people. Let us then sing praises to the eternal memory of the deceased, and take
full advantage of the lesson it has taught.

Lenin is referring to the appeal of members of the First State Duma known as
the “Vyborg Manifesto”. The appeal was adopted on July 9-10
(22-23), 1906, at a meeting in Vyborg attended by about 200 deputies, mostly
Cadets, after the dissolution of the First Duma. The appeal called on the people
to offer “passive resistance” to the government, to refuse to pay
taxes or provide recruits until the tsar had ordered new elections to the
Duma. In September 1906 the Congress of the Cadet Party openly declared the use
of “passive resistance” to be “virtually unrealisable”.

We are thus brought face to face with the second question, viz., the objective,
historically dictated content of the impending struggle, and the slogans which
we must provide for it.


Here, too, the not very steadfast Social-Democrats, the Mensheviks, have
vacillated. Their first slogan was: fight for the resumption of the Duma
sessions for the purpose of convening a constituent assembly. The
St. Petersburg Committee protested against this. The absurdity of this slogan
is too obvious. It is not even opportunism, it is sheer non sense. The Central
Committee made a step forward with the slogan: fight against the government
in defence of the Duma for the purpose of convening a constituent assembly.
This, of course, is better. It is not far removed from the slogan: fight for
the overthrow of the autocratic government in order to convene a
constituent assembly in a revolutionary way. The dissolution of the Duma
undoubtedly provides the grounds for a nation-wide struggle for a
representative assembly of the people with power; in this sense the slogan
“in defence of the Duma” is not entirely unacceptable. But the
whole point is that in this sense this slogan is already implied by our
acceptance of the dissolution of the Duma as the grounds for a
struggle. Without the special interpretation of it in this sense
(i. e., in the sense just mentioned) the formula “in defence of the
Duma” remains obscure and is liable to create misunderstanding and to
bring us back to the somewhat obsolete past, to the Cadet Duma. In
short, this formula gives rise to a number of incorrect and harmful
“retrograde” ideas. What is correct in it is wholly and entirely
embodied in the reasons for our decision to fight, in the
explanation of why the dissolution of the Duma is considered a
sufficiently important ground for fighting.


Under no circumstances should a Marxist forget that the slogan of the
immediately impending struggle cannot be deduced simply and directly
from the general slogan of a certain programme. It is not sufficient to
refer to our programme (see last part: The Overthrow of the Autocracy and the
Constituent Assembly, etc.) in order to determine the

    

slogan of the struggle that is immediately impending now, in the summer
or autumn of 1906. For this we must take into account the concrete
historical situation, we must trace the whole development and the whole
consecutive progress of the revolution; our tasks must be deduced not only from
the principles of the programme, but also from the preceding steps and
stages of the movement. Only such an analysis will be a truly historical
analysis,, obligatory for a dialectical materialist.


And precisely such an analysis shows us that the objective political situation
has now brought to the fore the question, not whether a representative
assembly of the people exists, but whether this representative assembly
·has power.


The objective cause of the downfall of the Cadet Duma was not that it was unable
to express the needs of the people, but that it was unable to cope with the
revolutionary task of the struggle for power. The Cadet Duma
imagined that it was a constitutional organ, but it was in fact a
revolutionary organ (the Cadets abused us for regarding the Duma as a stage or
an instrument of the revolution, but experience has fully confirmed our
view). The Cadet Duma imagined that it was an organ of struggle against the
Cabinet, but it was in fact an organ of struggle for the
overthrow of the entire old regime. That is what happened in fact,
because that is what the actual economic situation demanded. And for
this struggle an organ like the Cadet Duma proved
“useless”.


The thought that is now being hammered into the head of even the most ignorant
muzhik is: the Duma is of no use; no Duma is of any use if the people do not
have power. But how to get power? By overthrowing the old regime
and establishing a new one, popular, free and elected. Either
overthrow the old regime, or admit that the aims of the revolution in
the scope set by the peasantry and the proletariat cannot be realised.


That is how life itself has put the question. That is how 1906 has put
it. And that is how it has been put by the dissolution of the Cadet Duma.


We cannot, of course, guarantee that the revolution will solve this problem at
one stroke, that the struggle will be

    

an easy and simple one, that victory is completely and absolutely assured. No
      one can ever give any such guarantees on the eve of the struggle. A slogan
      is not a guarantee of simple and easy victory. A slogan is an indication
      of the aim that must be achieved in order to fulfil
    certain tasks. In the past, such an immediate task was the creation
    (or convocation) in general of a representative assembly of the people. Now
    the task is to secure power for such a representative
    assembly. This means removing, destroying, over throwing the old
    regime, overthrowing the autocratic government.


Unless this task is fully carried out, the popular representative
assembly cannot have full power; hence, too, there cannot be adequate
guarantees that the new popular representative assembly will not share the fate
of the Cadet Duma.


The objective state of affairs at the present time is bringing to the fore a
fight, not for a popular representative assembly, but for the creation of
conditions under which it will be impossible to disperse or dissolve it,
impossible to reduce it to a farce, as Trepov & Co. did the Cadet Duma.

      Lenin
The Dissolution of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat



    

III

The form which the coming struggle will probably take is determined partly by
its content and partly by the preceding forms of the revolutionary struggle of
the people and of the counter-revolutionary struggle of the autocracy.


As regards the content of the struggle, we have already shown that after two
years of revolution it now centres on the overthrow of the old regime. The
complete achievement of this aim is possible only by means of an armed uprising
of the whole people.


As regards the preceding forms of the struggle, the “last word” of
the mass popular movement in Russia is a general strike and an uprising. The
last quarter of 1905 could not but leave ineradicable traces in the mind and
mood of the proletariat, the peasantry, the politically-conscious sections of
the army, and the democratic sections of the various professional associations
of intellectuals. It is quite

    

natural, therefore, that after the dissolution of the Duma, the first thought to
enter the minds of the broad mass of those capable of fighting was: the general
strike. No one seemed to entertain any doubt that the reply to the dissolution
of the Duma must inevitably be an all-Russian strike.


The universal acceptance of this opinion was of definite value. Nearly
everywhere the revolutionary organisations deliberately and systematically
restrained the workers from spontaneous and limited outbreaks. Reports
to this effect are coming in from all parts of Russia. The experience of
October-December has undoubtedly helped to concentrate everyone’s attention to a
much greater degree than before on general and simultaneous
action. Furthermore, another very characteristic fact must be noted: judging
from the reports from some of the big centres of the working-class movement,
e. g., St. Petersburg, the workers have not only quickly and easily appreciated
the need for general and simultaneous action, but have firmly insisted on
militant and determined action. The ill-advised idea of a
demonstration (one-day or three-day) strike against the
dissolution of the Duma
suggested by several St. Petersburg Mensheviks met with the most determined
opposition of the workers. The true class instinct and experience of those who
had more than once waged a serious struggle at once suggested to them that the
issue now required far more than a demonstration. We shall not demonstrate, said
the workers. We shall start a desperate, determined fight when the moment for
general action arrives. Judging from the available information, this was the
general opinion of the St. Petersburg workers. They understood that partial
actions, and demonstrations in particular, would be ridiculous after all that
Russia has gone through since 1901 (the year in which the widespread
demonstration movement began); that the intensification of the political crisis makes
it impossible to “start from the beginning” again; that organising
peaceful demonstrations would merely play into the hands of the government,
which had “tasted blood” with great satisfaction in
December. Peaceful demonstrations would exhaust the proletariat to no purpose
and would merely provide exercise for the police and soldiers in seizing and
shooting unarmed people. They would

    

merely somewhat confirm Stolypin’s boast that he had achieved victory over the
      revolution, for he had dissolved the Duma without thereby intensifying the
      anti-government movement. Now everyone regards this as an empty boast, for
      everyone knows and feels that the fight is still ahead. At that time a
      “demonstration” would have been construed as a struggle, it
      would have been converted into a (hopeless) struggle, and the cessation of
      the demonstration would have been proclaimed throughout the world as
      another defeat.


The idea of a demonstration strike was only worthy of our
Ledru-Rollins[1]

of the Cadet Party, who overrated parliamentarism as short-sightedly as
Ledru-Rollin did in 1849. The proletariat rejected this idea at once, and it did
well to reject it. The workers, who have always stood face to face with the
revolutionary struggle, appreciated more correctly than certain intellectuals
both the enemy’s readiness to fight and the need for resolute militant action.


Unfortunately, in our Party, owing to the predominance of the Right wing among
Russian Social-Democrats at the present time, the question of militant action
has been neglected. The Unity Congress of the Russian Social-Democrats was
carried away by the Cadet victories; it was unable to appreciate the
revolutionary significance of the present situation and shirked the task of
drawing all the conclusions from the experience of October-December. But the
necessity of using this experience confronted the Party much sooner and much
more sharply than many devotees of parliamentarism had expected. The confusion
displayed by the central institutions of our Party at the critical moment was
the inevitable outcome of this state of affairs.


The combination of a mass political strike with an armed uprising is again
dictated by the whole situation. At the same time, the weak aspects of a strike
as an independent means of struggle stand out in bold relief. Everyone is
convinced that an extremely important condition for the success of a political
strike is suddenness, the possibility of catching the government unawares. This
is now impossible. The government learned in December how to combat strikes,
and at the present moment it is very well prepared

    

for such a fight. Everyone points out the extreme importance of the railways
during a general strike. If the railways stop running—the strike has every
chance of becoming general. If the railways are not brought to a complete
standstill— the strike will almost certainly not be general. But it is
particularly difficult for the railwaymen to strike: punitive trains stand in
full readiness and armed troop detachments are scattered all along the line, at
the stations, sometimes even in the trains. A strike under such conditions may
mean— in the majority of cases it must mean—a direct and immediate
collision with the armed forces. The engine-driver, the telegraphist, the
switchman, will instantly be faced with the dilemma: either to be shot on the
spot (Golutvino, Lubertsy and other stations on the Russian railway system have
not won revolutionary fame all over Russia for nothing) or to remain at work and
break the strike.


Of course, we have a right to expect great heroism from very many railway
workers and employees, who have proved their devotion to the cause of liberty by
deeds. Of course, we are far from denying the possibility of a railway
strike and its chances of success. But we have no right to hide from ourselves
the real difficulties of the task; to remain silent about such
difficulties would be the very worst policy. If we face realities, if we do not
bury our heads in the sand, it will be clear that a strike must
inevitably and immediately develop into an armed uprising. A railway
strike is an uprising; this cannot be disputed after what happened in
December. And without a railway strike, the railway telegraph will not stop
working, the conveyance of letters by rail will not be interrupted, and,
consequently, a post and telegraph strike of serious dimensions will also be
impossible.


Thus, the inexorable logic of the situation that has developed since December
1905 proves the subordinate significance of a strike in relation to an
uprising. Whether we like it or not, and in spite of all
“directives”, the acute revolutionary situation is bound to convert
a demonstration into a strike, a protest into a fight, a strike into an
uprising. Of course, an uprising, an armed mass struggle, can flare up only if
it is actively supported by one or another section of the army. Therefore, a
strike of the troops, their refusal

    

to shoot at the people, can undoubtedly, in certain cases, lead to the victory
      of a merely peaceful strike. But it is scarcely necessary to prove that
      such cases would be but single episodes in an exceptionally successful
      uprising, and that there is only one way of making such episodes more
      frequent and likely: successful preparation for an uprising, energy and
      strength in the first insurgent actions, demoralisation of the troops by
      extremely daring attacks or by the desertion of a large section of the
      army, etc.


In short, in the situation now created by the dissolution of the Duma, there can
be no doubt that an active fight must lead directly and immediately to an
uprising. Perhaps the situation will change; in that case this conclusion will
have to be revised; but for the time being it is absolutely
indisputable. Therefore, to call for an all-Russian strike without calling for
an uprising, without explaining its in separable connection with an uprising,
would be folly bordering on crime. Therefore, in our work of agitation, all
efforts must be concentrated on explaining the connection between the two forms
of the struggle, on preparing the conditions that will enable three streams of
the struggle—a workers’ outbreak, a peasant uprising and an army
“revolt”— to merge into a single torrent. These three forms
of a really popular, i.e., mass, active movement, infinitely remote
from a mere conspiracy, of an uprising, overthrowing the autocracy,
were quite definitely seen long ago, last summer at the time of the famous
mutiny of the Potemkin.[2]

The success of an all-Russian uprising
probably depends most of all on the fusion of these three streams. No doubt such
grounds for a struggle as the dissolution of the Duma will greatly assist this
fusion, because the most backward section of the peasants (and, consequently,
of our army, which mainly consists of peasants) had set great hopes on the Duma.


Hence the conclusion: to take the greatest possible advantage of the
dissolution of the Duma as the grounds for concentrated agitation and for a
call for a national uprising; to explain the connection between a political
strike and an uprising; to direct all efforts towards achieving unity and joint
action on the part of the workers, peasants, soldiers and sailors in an active,
armed struggle.

 

Finally, when speaking of the form of the movement, special mention must be made
of the peasant struggle. Here the connection between a strike and an uprising is
particularly clear.’ It is also clear that here the purpose of an uprising must
be, not only the complete destruction, or removal, of all local authorities and
their replacement by new authorities elected by the people (the common aim of
every uprising, whether in the towns, in the countryside, in the army, etc.),
but also the expulsion of the landlords and the seizure of their
lands. The peasants must undoubtedly aim at the actual abolition of
landlordism even before the question is decided by a national constituent
assembly. There is no need to say much about this, because no one, probably,
could imagine a peasant uprising without the peasants settling accounts with the
landlords and seizing their lands. Obviously, the more conscious and organised
such an uprising is, the fewer will be the instances of destruction of
buildings, property, livestock, etc. From a military point of view, for the
achievement of certain military aims, destruction—e. g., the burning of
buildings and sometimes of property—is quite legitimate and essential in
certain cases. Only pedants (or traitors to the people) can bewail the fact that
the peasants always resort to such methods. Nevertheless, we need not conceal
from ourselves that the destruction of property is sometimes only the result of
lack of organisation, of inability to take and retain the property of
the enemy instead of destroying it—or the result of weakness,
when one of the belligerent sides wreaks vengeance on the enemy because
it is not strong enough to destroy or crush him. Of course, in our work
of agitation we must, on the one hand, do all we can to explain to the peasants
that it is absolutely legitimate and necessary to wage a pitiless
struggle against the enemy, even to the extent of destroying his property; on
the other hand, we must show that on the degree of organisation depends the
possibility of a much more rational and advantageous outcome of the struggle:

destroying the enemy (the landlords and bureaucrats, especially the police) and
transferring all property to the people, or to the peasants, intact (or with the
least possible damage).

The mutiny on the armoured cruiser Potemkin
broke out on June 14 (27), 1905. The crew brought the warship to the port of
Odessa, where a general strike was in progress. However, the favourable
conditions that had arisen for joint action by the Odessa workers and the
sailors of the Potemkin were not utilised. Numerous arrests of its
members had weakened the Odessa Bolshevik organisation and it lacked unity. The
Mensheviks were against an armed uprising and held the workers and sailors back
trem action. The tsar ist government ordered the entire Black Sea Fleet to crush
the rising on the Potemkin, but the crews refused to open fire on the
cruiser and the commanders were compelled to withdraw the squad ron. After
eleven days of cruising in the Black Sea the crew of the Potemkin were
forced by shortage of food and coal to take their vessel to a Rumanian port and
surrender to the authorities there. Most of the sailors remained abroad. Those
who returned to Russia were arrested and court-martialled.


The Potemkin mutiny was unsuccessful, but the fact that the crew of a
big naval vessel had joined the revolution marked an im portant stage in the
development of the struggle against the autocracy. In his appraisal of its
significance, Lenin called it “the attempt to form the nucleus of a
revolutionary army” (see present edition, Vol. 5, p. 562).

Lenin: 1906/dissolut: IV







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Dissolution of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat



    

IV

The question of the form of the struggle is closely bound up with the question
of organisation for the struggle.


In this respect, too, the great historical experience of October-December 1905
has left indelible traces on the revolutionary movement of today. The Soviets of
Workers’ Deputies and similar bodies (Peasants’ Committees, Railwaymen’s
Committees, Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies, etc.) enjoy tremendous and fully
deserved prestige. It would not be easy at present to find a Social-Democrat, or
a revolutionary belonging to some other party or trend, who would not be in
favour of such organisations in general, or who would not recommend their
formation at the present moment in particular.


It seems to me there is no difference of opinion, or at least no serious
difference of opinion, on this point. Hence there is no need to dwell on this
particular question.


But there is one aspect to which we must devote particular attention, because
it is most often ignored. I refer to the fact that the role played by the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies (for the sake of brevity we shall speak of them as
the type of all organisations of this kind) in the great October and
December days surrounded them with something like a halo, so that sometimes they
are treated almost as a fetish. People imagine that those organs are
“necessary and sufficient” for a mass revolutionary movement at all
times and in all circumstances. Hence the uncritical attitude towards the
choice of the moment for the creation of such bodies, towards the question of
what the real conditions are for the success of their activities.


The experience of October-December has provided very instructive guidance on
this point. Soviets of Workers’ Deputies are organs of direct mass
struggle. They originated as organs of the strike struggle. By
force of circumstances they very quickly became the organs of the general
revolutionary struggle against the government. The course of events and
the transition from a strike to an uprising irresistibly transformed
them into organs of an up rising. That

    

this was precisely the role that quite a number of “soviets” and
“committees” played in December, is an absolutely indisputable
fact. Events have proved in the most striking and convincing manner that the
strength and importance of such organs in time of militant action depend
entirely upon the strength and success of the uprising.


It was not some theory, not appeals on the part of some one, or tactics invented
by someone, not party doctrine, but the force of circumstances that led these
non-party mass organs to realise the need for an uprising and transformed them
into organs of an uprising.


At the present time, too, to establish such organs means creating organs of an
uprising; to call for their establishment means calling for an uprising. To
forget this, or to veil it from the eyes of the broad mass of the people, would
be the most unpardonable short-sightedness and the worst of policies.


If that is so—and undoubtedly it is—the conclusion to be drawn is
also clear: “soviets” and similar mass institutions are in
themselves insufficient for organising an uprising. They are necessary
for welding the masses together, for creating unity in the struggle, for handing
on the party slogans (or slogans advanced by agreement between parties) of
political leadership, for awakening the interest of the masses, for rousing and
attracting them. But they are not sufficient for organising the immediate
fighting forces, for organising an uprising in the narrowest sense
of the word.


A slight illustration. The Soviets of Workers’ Deputies have often been called
parliaments of the working class. But no worker would agree to his
parliament being convened only for it to be handed over to the police. All
workers would admit the need immediately to organise forces, to set up
a military organisation composed of detachments of armed workers to
protect their “parliament”.


Now that the government has thoroughly learned by experience what
“soviets” lead to and what sort of institutions they are, now that
it has armed itself from head to foot and is waiting for such institutions to be
formed so as to attack the enemy before he has time to reflect and develop his

    

activities, it is especially necessary for us to explain in our work of
      agitation the need for a sober view of things, the need for a military
      organisation alongside the organisation of soviets, for defending
    the latter, for carrying out an uprising, without which the soviets or any
    elected representatives of the masses will remain power less.


These “military organisations”, if one may call them so, must strive
to rally the masses not through the medium of elected persons, but directly by
rallying the masses that are immediately taking part in street fighting and
civil war. The nuclei of such organisations should be very small, voluntary
units of ten, five, perhaps even three persons. We must with the utmost vigour
make it known that a battle is approaching in which it will be the duty of
every honest citizen to be ready to sacrifice himself and fight against
the oppressors of the people. Less formality, less red tape, more simplicity in
organisation, which must be as mobile and as flexible as possible. All those who
wish to take the side of liberty must at once unite by forming fighting groups
of five—voluntary units of persons working in the same trade or the same
factory, or of people connected by ties of comrade ship, or by Party ties, or,
finally, simply by residence (those living in the same village, or in the same
house or flat in a town). There must be both party and non-party units of this
kind, bound together by the single, immediate revolutionary task: an uprising
against the government. Such units must be formed without fail on the widest
possible scale even before arms are obtained, irrespective of whether
arms can be obtained or not.


No Party organisation will “arm” the masses. On the contrary, the
organisation of the masses into light, mobile, small fighting units will, when
things begin to move, render a very great service in regard to procuring arms.


Volunteer fighting units, composed of

“druzhinniki”, 

if we adopt the name made so honourable by the great December days in Moscow, will be
of tremendous value at the moment of the outbreak. A
“druzhina”, or volunteer squad, that can shoot will be able
to disarm a policeman, or suddenly attack a patrol and thus procure arms. A
volunteer squad

    

which cannot shoot, or which has not procured arms, will assist in building
barricades, reconnoitring, organising liaisons, setting ambushes for the enemy,
setting fire to houses occupied by the enemy, occupying rooms to serve as bases
for the insurgents—in short, thousands of the most diverse functions can
be performed by voluntary units of persons who are determined to fight to the
last gasp, who know the locality well, who are most closely connected with the
population.


Let an appeal be made at every factory, in every trade union and in every
village for the formation of such volunteer fighting squads. People who are
well known to each other will form them in advance. People who do not know each
other will form squads of five and ten on the day of the fight, or on the eve of
the fight, on the spot where fighting takes place, if the idea of forming such
units is spread widely among the masses and actually adopted by them.


At the present time, when the dissolution of the Duma has stirred up many new
sections of the population, one frequently hears the most revolutionary
responses and declarations from ordinary representatives of the least organised
sections of the common people in the towns, even of those who on the surface
appear to be most “Black-Hundred” in character. Let us then make
sure that they are all informed of the decision of the vanguard of the workers
and peasants to begin the fight for land and liberty in the very near future,
that they are all made aware of the necessity of forming volunteer fighting
squads, that they are all convinced of the inevitability of an uprising and of
its popular character. If we achieve this—and it is not at all
utopian—we shall have in every large town, not hundreds of
druzhinniki, as in Moscow in December, but thousands upon thousands of
them. And then no machine-guns will be able to stand up to us, as
people used to say in Moscow when arguing that the fighting squads there were
not sufficiently of a mass character and were not sufficiently close to the
people in type and composition.


Thus: organisation of Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, of Peasants’ Committees and
of similar bodies everywhere, together with the most widespread propaganda and
agitation

    

for the necessity of a simultaneous uprising, for the immediate
      preparation of forces for this, and for organising volunteer squads of
    “druzhinniki” on a mass scale.

 *     *  * 

P. S.

This chapter was already written when we learned of a new
“turn” in the slogans of our Central Committee:

for the Duma as an organ for convening the constituent assembly.


The question of organisation, therefore, includes the additional question of
organising a provisional revolutionary government, for that in point of fact is
what a body really capable of convening a constituent assembly would be. But we
must not forget, as our Cadetophiles are fond of doing, that a provisional
government is primarily the organ of an uprising. Does the late Duma
wish to become the organ of an uprising? Do the Cadets wish to be the organ of
an uprising? By all means, gentlemen! In the struggle we welcome all
allies among the bourgeois democrats. Even if your alliance—excuse me for
saying so—were the same thing for us as the alliance with France is for
Russia (i.e., a source of funds), even then we should be very pleased; we are
practical politicians, gentlemen. But if your Cadet participation in an
uprising is merely an empty dream of the Mensheviks, we shall merely say: How
petty and trifling your dreams are, Menshevik comrades! But take care you do not
die of “unrequited love” for the Cadets, who will be unable to
return your passion....


The theoretical aspect of the question of a provisional government has been
discussed more than once. The possibility of Social-Democrats taking part in a
provisional government has been proved. Of greater interest now, however, is the
practical aspect provided by the events of
October-December. The Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, etc., were in fact the
embryos of a provisional government; power would inevitably have
passed to them had the uprising been victorious. The centre of attention must
now be shifted to studying these embryonic organs of a new government that
history has brought into being, to studying the conditions for their

    

work and their success. This is of more vital importance and more
interesting at the present time than speculation “in general” about
a provisional revolutionary government.

The Dissolution of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat

It remains for us to consider the question of the moment to be chosen for an
uprising. The tender affection of the Right-wing Social-Democrats for the Cadet
Duma caused them to demand immediate action. This idea ended in a complete
fiasco. The attitude adopted by the mass of the working class and of the urban
population in general has shown that the gravity of the situation is appreciated
or apprehended. A real fight is expected, not for the Duma, of course, but for
the overthrow of the old regime. The delay is due to the general mood
prevailing, to the desire to prepare for a really decisive and desperate
struggle, the desire to achieve co-ordinated action.


It is possible, and perhaps most probable, that the new struggle will break out
just as spontaneously and unexpectedly as the previous ones did, as a result of
a rise in temper and of one of the inevitable explosions. If things take that
turn, if such a course of development proves inevitable, we shall not have to
decide the question of the time for action; our task then will consist in
greatly intensifying our work of agitation and organisation on the lines already
indicated.


It is possible, however, that events may require that we, the leaders, appoint
the time for action. In that case, we should advise that an all-Russian action,
strike and uprising, be timed for the end of summer or the beginning of autumn,
towards the middle or end of August. The important thing would be to take
advantage of the building season in the towns and the end of summer work in the
fields. If we could secure agreement among all the influential
revolutionary organisations and unions as to the time for action, there would be a
real possibility of carrying it out at the time fixed. The simultaneous
beginning of the struggle over the whole of Russia would be a great
advantage. Even if the government got wind of the time fixed for the strike,

    

that would in all probability not be fatal; a strike is not a plot, or a
      military attack that depends upon surprise. The troops all over Russia
      would probably be most of all demoralised if they were kept week after
      week with the thought of the inevitable outbreak of the struggle preying
      on their minds, if they were kept under arms, and if agitation were
      carried on with increasing vigour by all organisations side by side with
      the mass of “non-party” revolutionaries. Influential members
      of the Duma among the Social-Democrats and Trudoviks could also help to
      make simultaneous action successful.


Isolated and absolutely useless outbreaks, like “revolts” of
soldiers and hopeless peasant risings could, perhaps, be restrained if the whole
of revolutionary Russia were convinced that this great universal fight is
inevitable.


We repeat, however, that this is possible only if complete agreement is reached
among all the influential organisations. Otherwise, only the old way
of the spontaneous rise of temper will be left open.

Lenin: 1906/dissolut: VI







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Dissolution of the Duma and the Tasks of the Proletariat



    

VI

To sum up briefly.


The dissolution of the Duma marks a complete turn to wards autocracy. The
possibility of simultaneous action all over Russia is increasing. The
probability of all partial uprisings merging into one is increasing. The
inevitability of a political strike and of an uprising as a fight for power is
felt as never before by large sections of the population.


What we have to do is to develop the widest possible agitation in favour of an
all-Russian uprising, to explain its political and organisational tasks, to
exert every effort to make everyone realise that it is inevitable, to make all
the people see the possibility of a general onslaught so that they undertake not
a “riot” or a “demonstration”, not mere strikes and
wrecking of property, but a fight for power, a fight with the aim of
overthrowing the government.


The whole situation favours the fulfilment of this task. The proletariat is
preparing to put itself at the head of the

    

struggle. A responsible and difficult, but a great and thankful task
confronts the revolutionary Social-Democrats: to assist the working
class as the advanced detachment of an all-Russian uprising.


This uprising will overthrow the autocracy and will create a
representative assembly of the people with real power, i.e., a
constituent assembly.

began.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]

The uprising in the Sveoborg fortress (near Helsingfors), which began
during the night of July 17-18 (30-31), 1906, broke out spontaneously and
prematurely, being to a large extent provoked by the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. On receiving information about the situation in
Sveaborg and the possibility of an armed uprising, the St. Petersburg Committee
of the R.S.D.L.P. decided on the urgent dispatch of a delegation to Sveaborg
with instructions to secure a postponement of the action or, if this could not
be achieved, to take the most active part in leading the uprising. The text of
the decision was written by V. I. Lenin (see p. 132 of this volume). Finding it
impossible to prevent spontaneous action, the Bolsheviks headed the
uprising. Its leaders were members of the military organisation of the
B.S.D.L.P.— Lieutenants A. P. Yemelyanov and Y. L. Kokhansky. Seven out of
10 artillery companies took an active part in the uprising.

   

The insurgents put forward the slogans of overthrow of the autocracy, freedom
or he people, the transfer of land to the peasants. The working class in
      Finland took action in support; a general strike began on July 18 (31) in
      Helsingfors and subsequently spread to other towns. The uprising continued
      for three days, but the general lack of preparation for action had its
      effect and on July 20 (August 2), after the fortress had been subjected to
      a naval bombardment, the Sveaborg uprising was crushed. Its participants
      were handed over for court-martial; forty-three men were executed and some
      hundreds sent to penal servitude or imprisoned.

In view of the Special reports received from Sveaborg[1]

concerning the extremely acute situation in this town and
the possibility of an immediate outbreak, the Executive
Commission of the St. Petersburg Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. resolves:


1) to send immediately to Sveaborg a delegation consisting of
comrades NNNN; 


2) to instruct this delegation to take all measures required for a thorough
   examination of the situation on the spot;


3) to instruct it to influence local members of the Party, revolutionaries and
   the population so as to secure a postponement of action, provided this is
   possible without excessive sacrifice on the part of the population through
   arrests by the government of persons already marked out for that purpose;


4) to instruct the delegation, in case it is quite impossible to stop an
   outbreak, to take the most active part in leading the movement, i. e., to
   help the masses who have joined the struggle to organise independently, to
   disarm and wipe out the reaction, to undertake decisive offensive action
   after suitable preparation, and to come forward with correct and really
   revolutionary slogans, capable of rallying the whole people.

A month has passed since the State Duma was dissolved. The first wave of armed
uprisings and of strikes in an at tempt to support the insurgents, has
passed. In some places the zeal of the authorities, who have been employing
“emergency” and “special emergency” measures for the
defence of the government against the people, is beginning to subside. The
significance of the past stage of the revolution is be coming more and more
apparent. A new wave is drawing nearer and nearer.


The Russian revolution is proceeding along a hard and difficult road. Every
upsurge, every partial success is followed by defeat, bloodshed and outrage
committed by the autocracy against the champions of freedom. But after every
“defeat” the movement spreads, the struggle becomes more intense,
ever larger masses of people are drawn into the fight, more classes and groups
of people participate in it. Every onslaught of the revolution, every step
forward in organising the militant democrats is followed by a positively frantic
attack by the reaction, by another step taken in organising the Black-Hundred
elements of the people, and by the increased arrogance of the
counter-revolution, desperately fighting for its very existence. But in spite
of all these efforts, the forces of reaction are steadily declining. More and
more workers, peasants and soldiers, who only yesterday were indifferent, or
even sided with the Black Hundreds, are now passing over to the side of the
revolution. One by one, the illusions and prejudices which made the Russian
people confiding, patient, simple-minded, obedient, all-enduring and
all-forgiving, are being destroyed.

 

Many wounds have been inflicted on the autocracy, but it has yet not been
      killed. The autocracy is swathed in band ages, but it is still holding
      out, it is still creaking along, and is even becoming more ferocious as
      its life-blood oozes away. The revolutionary classes of the people, headed
      by the proletariat, take advantage of every lull to gather new forces, to
      strike fresh blows at the enemy, so as to root out at last the accursed
      canker of Asiatic tyranny and serfdom which is poisoning Russia.


There is no surer means of overcoming faint-heartedness and of refuting all
narrow, one-sided, petty and cowardly views on the future of our revolution than
by casting a general glance at its past. The history of the Russian revolution
is still a short one, but it has sufficiently demonstrated and proved to us
that the strength of the revolutionary classes and the wealth of their
historical, creative power are far greater than they seem to be in times of
calm. Every rising wave of the revolution has revealed an unobtrusive and
relatively silent accumulation of forces for the fulfilment of the new and
loftier task, and every time the short sighted and timid appraisals of political
slogans have been refuted by an outburst of these accumulated forces.


Three main stages of our revolution have become clearly discernible. The first
stage was the period of “confidence”, the period of mass pleadings,
petitions and declarations about the need for a constitution. The second stage
was the period of constitutional manifestoes, acts and laws. The third stage was
the beginning of the realisation of constitutionalism, the period of the State
Duma. At first the tsar was begged to grant a constitution. Later on the solemn
recognition of a constitution was forcibly wrested from the tsar.

Now... now,
after the dissolution of the Duma, experience teaches us that a constitution
bestowed by the tsar, acknowledged by the laws of the tsar, and carried out by
the tsarist officials, is not worth a brass farthing.


In each of these periods we see the forefront at first occupied by the liberal
bourgeoisie, noisy, bragging, full of narrow, petty-bourgeois prejudices and
conceit, cocksure of its “right of inheritance”, patronisingly
teaching its “younger brother” the ways of peaceful struggle, of
loyal opposition, of harmonising the freedom of the people with

    

the tsarist regime. And on every occasion this liberal bourgeoisie succeeded
in confusing some Social-Democrats (of the Right wing), in securing their
acceptance of its political slogans and subjecting them to its political
leadership. But in reality, obscured by the hullabaloo of the liberals’
political game, the revolutionary forces among the masses grew and matured. In
reality, the solution of the political problem which history had
brought to the forefront was undertaken each time by the proletarians, who
attracted the advanced peasants to their side and came out into the streets,
cast aside all old laws and conventions and gave the world new forms and methods
of direct revolutionary struggle, and combined means of waging it.


Recall January 9. To everyone’s surprise the heroic action of the workers put an
end to the period of the tsar’s “confidence” in the people and the
people’s “confidence” in the tsar! At one stroke they raised the
whole movement to a new and higher plane! And yet, on the surface, January 9 was
a complete defeat. Thousands of proletarians killed and wounded, an orgy of
repression, the dark cloud of the Trepov regime hanging over Russia.


The liberals again came to the fore. They organised brilliant congresses,
spectacular deputations to the tsar. They clutched with both hands at the sop
that was thrown to them, the Bulygin Duma. They already began to growl at the
revolution like dogs who have spied a choice titbit, and appealed to the
students to go on with their studies and not to meddle in politics. And the
faint-hearted among the adherents of the revolution began to say: Let us go
into the Duma; after the Potemkin affair an armed uprising is hope
less; now that peace has been concluded, militant, mass action is improbable.


The real solution of the next historical problem was again supplied only by the
revolutionary struggle of the proletariat. The Manifesto granting a
constitution was wrung from the tsar by the all-Russian strike in October. The
spirit of the peasants and the soldiers revived, and they turned to wards
liberty and light in the wake of the workers. Short weeks of liberty followed,
succeeded by weeks of pogroms, Black-Hundred brutality, a terrible sharpening of
the struggle, unprecedentedly bloody reprisals against all who had

    

taken up arms in defence of the liberties wrested from the tsar.


The movement was once again raised to a higher stage and yet, on the surface,
the proletariat again seemed to have suffered utter defeat. Frantic repression,
overcrowded prisons, endless executions, the despicable howling of the liberals
dissociating themselves from the uprising and the revolution.


The loyal liberal philistines are again in the forefront. They make capital out
of the last remaining prejudices of the peasants, who trust the tsar. They
assert that the victory of democracy at the elections will cause the walls of
Jericho to fall. They are predominant in the Duma and again begin to behave like
well-fed watchdogs towards “beggars”—the proletariat and the
revolutionary peasantry.


The dissolution of the Duma marks the end of the hegemony of the liberals,
which was holding back and degrading the revolution. The peasants have learned
more from the Duma than anyone. Their gain is that they are now losing their
most baneful illusions. And the whole people is emerging from the experience of
the Duma different from what it was before. As a result of the suffering caused
by the failure of the representative body on which so many had placed all their
hopes, the people now more definitely appreciate the task ahead. The Duma has
enabled them to gauge the forces more precisely; it has concentrated at least
some of the elements of the popular movement, it has shown in reality how the
different parties act, it has revealed much more vividly to ever wider masses of
the people the political character of the liberal bourgeoisie and of the
peasantry.


The Cadets were unmasked, the Trudoviks were consolidated—such are some
of the most important gains of the Duma period. The pseudo-democracy of the
Cadets was branded in the Duma itself scores of times, and that by men who were
prepared to trust them. The Russian muzhik has ceased to be a political
sphinx. In spite of all distortions of the freedom of election, he has managed
to assert himself and has created a new political type, the Trudovik. Hence
forth, in addition to the signatures of organisations and parties which were
built up in the course of decades, revolutionary manifestoes[1]

will bear the signature of the Trudovik

    

Group, which was formed in the course of. a few weeks. The ranks of
revolutionary democracy have been reinforced by a new organisation, which, of
course, shares a good many of the illusions that are characteristic of the small
producer, but which in the present revolution undoubtedly expresses the trend
toward a ruthless mass struggle against Asiatic despotism and feudal
landlordism.


The revolutionary classes are emerging from the experience of the Duma more
united, more closely bound to one another, more capable of undertaking a general
onslaught. Another wound has been inflicted on the autocracy. It has become
still more isolated. It is still more helpless in the face of the problems which
it is quite incapable of solving. And starvation and unemployment are becoming
more acute. Peasant revolts are breaking out more and more frequently.


Sveaborg and Kronstadt[2]

have revealed the spirit of the army and navy. The
uprisings have been suppressed, but the uprising lives, is spreading and gaining
strength. Many Black-Hundred elements joined the strike that was called in
support of the insurgents. The advanced workers stopped this strike, and they
were right to do so, because the strike began to develop into a demonstration,
whereas the task was to organise a great and decisive struggle.


The advanced workers were right in their estimate of the situation. They quickly
rectified the false strategical move and husbanded their forces for the coming
battle. They instinctively understood the inevitability of a strike as part of
an uprising and the harmfulness of a strike as a demonstration.


All evidence goes to show that temper is rising. An explosion is inevitable and
may be near at hand. The executions in Sveaborg and Kronstadt, the reprisals
against the peasants, the persecution of the Trudovik members of the Duma—
all this serves only to intensify hatred, to spread determination and
concentrated readiness for battle. More audacity, comrades! More confidence in
the strength of the revolutionary classes, especially the proletariat, enriched
as they now are by new experience; more independent initiative! All the signs
indicate that we are on the eve of a great struggle. All efforts must be
directed towards making it simultaneous, concentrated, full of that heroism of
the masses

    

which has marked all the great stages of the great Russian revolution. Let
the liberals cravenly hint at this coming struggle solely for the purpose
of threatening the government, let these narrow-minded philistines
concentrate the whole force of their “mind and sentiments” on the
expectation of a new election—the proletariat is preparing for the
struggle; it is unitedly and boldly marching to meet the storm, eager to
plunge into the thick of the fight. We have had enough of the hegemony of
the cowardly Cadets, those “stupid penguins” who “timidly hide their fat
bodies behind the rocks”.  

“Let the storm rage louder!”[3]


 
Notes
 
 



[1]

Lenin is referring to the manifestoes printed in July 1906 after the
dissolution of the First Duma: “To the Army and Navy”,
“Manifesto to All the Russian Peasants”, “To the Whole
People”. These manifestoes stressed the need for an armed uprising.





[2]

This refers to the uprisings in Sveaborg (see Note 54) and
Kronstadt.


The uprising of sailors and soldiers in Kronstadt began on July 19
(August 1), 1906, after news had been received of the up rising in Sveaborg. In
the spring and summer of 1906, under the leadership of the Bolsheviks,
preparations had gone forward for an armed uprising of workers, soldiers and
sailors in Kronstadt. These preparations, however, were considerably complicated
by the arrest on July 9 (22) of the large part of the military and workers’
organisation of the R.S.D.L.P. Nevertheless, with the sup port of the
St. Petersburg Committee and its representative, D. Z. Manuilsky, the Bolsheviks
continued to make preparations for an armed uprising, at the same time rebuffing
the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had provoked a premature uprising. When the
spontaneous Sveaborg uprising broke out the preparations for an armed uprising
in Kronstadt had not been completed, but in view of the events in Sveaborg the
uprising in Kronstadt had to be begun prematurely. It was headed by the
Bolsheviks who tried to make the action as organised as possible. At a signal
agreed upon, the struggle was started almost simultaneously by mine layers,
sappers and soldiers of the electric-mine company and sailors of the First and
Second Naval Divisions; they were joined by part of the armed workers. The
government, however, had received information from provocateurs of the time
fixed for the uprising and had prepared in advance for the fight. The
disorganising activity of the Socialist-Revolutionaries also prevented the
uprising from taking a successful course. Towards the morning of July 20 (August
2) the uprising was quelled.


On July 20 (August 2) the St. Petersburg Committee took the decision to carry
out a political general strike in support of

   

the Kronstadt and Sveaborg risings, but on the following day news of the
suppression of the uprising was received and the decision was rescinded.


The tsarist government savagely punished the insurgents. More than 2,500 of the
participants in the Kronstadt uprising were arrested. Courts-martial sentenced
36 men to death; 130 were sent to penal servitude, 316 were imprisoned and 935
transferred to corrective battalions.

The Left-wing Social-Democrats must reconsider the question of boycotting the
State Duma. It should be borne in mind that we have always presented this
question concretely, and in connection with a definite political situation. For
instance, Proletary (Geneva)[4]

wrote that “it would be ridiculous to renounce utilising even
the Bulygin

Duma”[1]

—if

it could come into being. And
in referring to the Witte Duma in the pamphlet Social-Democracy and the
State Duma (by N. Lenin and F. Dan), N. Lenin wrote: “We must by all
means carefully reconsider the question of tactics... The situation has
changed” at the time of the Bulygin Duma (see p. 2 of the pamphlet

       cited).[2]


The principal difference between revolutionary Social-Democracy and opportunist
Social-Democracy on the question of boycott is as follows: the opportunists in
all circumstances confine themselves to applying the stereotyped method copied
from a specific period in the history of German socialism. We must utilise
representative institutions; the Duma is a representative institution; therefore
boycott is anarchism, and we must go into the Duma. All the arguments used by
our Mensheviks, and especially by Plekhanov, on this topic, could be reduced to
this childishly simple syllogism. The Menshevik resolution on the importance of
representative institutions in a revolutionary period (see
Parttiniye Izvestia,[5]

No. 2) strikingly reveals the stereotyped
and anti-historical nature of their argument.

 

The revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the contrary, lay chief emphasis on the
      necessity of carefully appraising the concrete political situation. It is
      impossible to cope with the tasks of the revolutionary epoch in Russia by
      copying in a biased manner one of the recent German stereotyped patterns,
      forgetting the lessons of 1847-48. The progress of our revolution will be
      altogether incomprehensible if we confine ourselves to making bare
      contrasts between “anarchist” boycott and Social-Democratic
      participation in elections. Learn from the history of the Russian
      revolution, gentlemen!


This history has proved that the tactics of boycotting the Bulygin Duma
were the only correct tactics at that time, and were entirely justified by
events. Whoever forgets this and argues about boycott without taking the lessons
of the Bulygin Duma into account (as the Mensheviks always do) is certifying his
own mental poverty, his inability to ex plain and take into account one of the
most important and eventful periods of the Russian revolution. The tactics of
boycotting the Bulygin Duma were based on a correct appraisal of the temper of
the revolutionary proletariat and of the objective features of the situation,
which made an immediate general outbreak inevitable.


Let us pass to the second lesson of history—to the Witte, Cadet
Duma. Nowadays we often hear Social-Democratic intellectuals making repentant
speeches about the boycott. of that Duma. The fact that it did assemble and
undoubtedly rendered indirect service to the revolution is considered to be
sufficient reason for penitently confessing that the boycott of the Witte Duma
had been a mistake.


Such a view, however, is extremely biased and short sighted. It fails to take
into consideration a number of very important facts of the period prior to the
Witte Duma, the period of its existence and the period after its
dissolution. Remember that the electoral law for that Duma was
promulgated on December 11,[6]

at a time when the insurgents were waging an armed fight for a
constituent assembly. Remember that even the Menshevik
“Nachalo” wrote at the time: “The proletariat will
also sweep away the Witte Duma, just as it swept away the Bulygin
Duma.” Under such circumstances the proletariat, could not and should not have

    

surrendered to the tsar without a fight the power to convene the first
representative assembly in Russia. The proletariat had to fight against the
autocracy being strengthened by a loan on the security of the Witte Duma. The
proletariat had to combat the constitutional illusions which, in the spring of
1906, formed the entire basis of the election campaign of the Cadets
and the elections among the peasantry. At that time, when the importance of the
Duma was being immeasurably exaggerated, the only means of combating such
illusions was the boycott. The degree to which the spread of
constitutional illusions was connected with participation in the election
campaign and in the elections in the spring of 1906 is strikingly revealed by
the attitude adopted by our Mensheviks. Suffice it to recall that, in spite of
the warnings of the Bolsheviks, in the resolution of the Fourth (Unity) Congress
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party the Duma was referred to as a
“power”! Another instance:

with complete self-assurance, Plekhanov wrote: “The government will
fall into the abyss when it dissolves the Duma.” In reply to him it was
said at that time: we must prepare to push the enemy into the abyss and
not, like the Cadets, place hopes on its “falling” into the abyss by
itself. And how soon the words then uttered were proved

       correct![3]


It was the duty of the proletariat to exert every effort to preserve the
independence of its tactics in our revolution, namely: together with the
politically conscious peasantry against the vacillating and treacherous
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie. But it was impossible to employ these
tactics during the elections to the Witte Duma owing to a number of
circumstances, both objective and subjective, which, in the vast majority of
localities in Russia, would have made participation in the elections tantamount
to the workers’ party tacitly supporting the Cadets. The proletariat could not
and should not have adopted half-hearted and artificially concocted tactics,
prompted by “cunning” and confusion, of elections for an unknown
purpose, of elections to the Duma, but not for the Duma. And yet it is a
historical fact, which cannot be abolished by the silence, subterfuges and
evasions of the Mensheviks, that not one
    

of them, not even Plekhanov, dared advocate in the press that we should
    go into the Duma. It is a fact that not a single call was issued
    in the press to go into the Duma. It is a fact that the Mensheviks then
    selves, in the leaflet issued by the Joint Central Committee of the
    R.S.D.L.P., officially recognised the boycott and confined the dispute
    only to the question of the stage at which the boycott was to be
    adopted. it is a fact that the Mensheviks laid emphasis, not on the
    elections to the Duma, but on the elections as such, and
    even on the process of electing as a means of organising for an
    uprising and for sweeping away the Duma. Events proved, however,
    that it was impossible to carry on mass agitation during the elections, and
    that the Duma alone provided certain opportunities for carrying on agitation
    among the masses.


Whoever really makes an effort to consider and weigh all these complicated
facts, both objective and subjective, will see that the Caucasus was only an
exception which proved the general rule. He will see that contrite speeches and
explaining away the boycott as a piece of “youthful impetuousness”
reveal an extremely narrow, superficial and short-sighted estimate of events.


The dissolution of the Duma has now clearly demonstrated that in the conditions
prevailing in the spring of 1906 the boycott, on the whole, was the right
tactics and advantageous. Under the conditions which then prevailed,
only by means of the boycott could the Social-Democrats fulfil their
duty of giving the people the necessary warning against the tsar’s constitution
and supplying the necessary criticism of the chicanery of the Cadets during the
elections; and both (warning and criticism) were strikingly confirmed by the
dissolution of the Duma.


Here is a small instance to illustrate the above. In the spring of 1906,
Mr. Vodovozov, who is half-Cadet and half Menshevik, was whole-heartedly in
favour of participating in the elections and supporting the Cadets. Yesterday
(August 11) he wrote in Tovarishch[7]

that the Cadets “wanted to be a parliamentary party in a country
that has no parliament and a constitutional party in a country that
has no constitution”; that “the whole character of the
Cadet Party has been determined by the fundamental contradiction
between

    

a radical programme and quite non-radical tactics”.


The Bolsheviks could not desire a greater triumph than this admission on the
part of a Left Cadet or Right-wing Plekhanovite.


However, while absolutely rejecting faint-hearted and short-sighted speeches of
repentance, as well as the silly explanation of the boycott as “youthful
impetuousness we do not by any means reject the new lessons of the
Cadet Duma. It would be pedantic obstinacy to be afraid of frankly admitting
these new lessons and taking them into account. History has shown that when the
Duma assembles opportunities arise for carrying on useful agitation both from
within the Duma and around it; that the tactics of joining forces with the
revolutionary peasantry against the Cadets can be applied in the Duma. This may
seem paradoxical, but such, undoubtedly, is the irony of history: it was the
Cadet Duma that clearly demonstrated to the masses the correctness of what we
might briefly describe as “anti-Cadet” tactics. History has
ruthlessly confuted all constitutional illusions and all “faith in the
Duma”; but history has undoubtedly proved that that institution is of
some, although modest, use to the revolution as a platform for agitation, for
exposing the true “inner nature” of the political parties, etc.


Hence the conclusion: it would be ridiculous to shut our eyes to realities. The
time has now come when the revolutionary Social-Democrats must cease to be
boycottists. We shall not refuse to go into the Second Duma when (or “if”)
it is convened. We shall not refuse to utilise this arena, but we shall not
exaggerate its modest importance; on the contrary, guided by the experience
already provided by history, we shall entirely subordinate the struggle we wage
in the Duma to another form of struggle, namely, strikes, up risings, etc. We
shall convene the Fifth Party Congress; there we shall resolve that in the
event of elections taking place, it will be necessary to enter into an
electoral agreement, for a few weeks, with the Trudoviks (unless the Fifth
Party Congress is convened it will be impossible to conduct a united election
campaign; and “blocs with other parties” are absolutely prohibited
by the decision of the Fourth Congress). And then we shall utterly rout the
Cadets.

 

This conclusion, however, does not by any means reveal the whole complexity of
      the task that confronts us. We deliberately emphasised the words:
    “in the event of elections taking place”, etc. We do
    not know yet whether the Second Duma will be convened, when the elections
    will take place, what the electoral laws will be like, or what the situation
    will be at that time. Hence our conclusion suffers from being extremely
    general: we need it to enable us to sum up past experience, to take note of
    the lessons of the past, to put the forthcoming questions of tactics on a
    proper basis; but it is totally inadequate for solving the concrete problems
    of immediate tactics.


Only Cadets and the “Cadet-like” people of all sorts can be
satisfied with such a conclusion at the present time, can create a “slogan”
for themselves out of the yearnings for a new Duma and try to persuade the
government of the desirability of convening it as quickly as possible, etc. Only
conscious or unconscious traitors to the revolution would at the present
time exert all efforts to divert the inevitable new rise of temper and
excitement into the channel of an election and not into that of a fight waged by
means of a general strike and uprising.


This brings us to the crux of the question of present-day Social-Democratic
tactics. The issue now is not whether we should take part in the elections. To
say “yes” or no in this case means saying nothing at all about the
fundamental problem of the moment. Outwardly, the political situation in August
1906 is similar to that in August 1905, but enormous progress has been made
during this period:

the forces that are fighting on the respective sides, the forms of the struggle,
and the time required for carrying out this or that strategic move—if we
may so express it— have all become more exactly defined.


The government’s plan is clear. It was absolutely right in its calculations when
it fixed the date of the convocation of the Duma and did not
fix—contrary to the law—the date of the elections.
The government does not want to tie its hands or show its cards. Firstly, it is
gaining time in which to consider an amendment of the electoral
law. Secondly— and this is the most important—it is keeping the date
of the elections in reserve until the character and intensity of

    

the new rise of temper can be fully gauged. The government wishes to fix the
date of the elections at the particular time (and perhaps in the particular
form, i.e., the form of elections) when it can split and paralyse the
incipient uprising. The government’s reasoning is correct: if things remain
quiet, perhaps we shall not convene the Duma at all, or revert to the Bulygin
laws. If, however, a strong movement arises, then we can try to split it by
fixing a date for the elections for the time being and in this way entice
certain cowards and simpletons away from the direct revolutionary struggle.


Liberal blockheads (see Tovarishch and Rech) so utterly fail
to understand the situation that they are of their own accord crawling into the
net set by the government. They are trying with might and main “to
prove” the need for the Duma and the desirability of diverting
the rising tide into the channel of an election. But even they cannot deny that
the question of what form the impending struggle will assume is still an open
one. Today’s issue of Rech (August 12) admits: “What the peasants
will say in the autumn ...

is still unknown.” ...

“It will be difficult to make any general forecasts
until September-October, when the temper of the peasantry is definitely
revealed.”


The liberal bourgeois remain true to their nature. They do not want to assist
actively in choosing the form of the struggle and in moulding the temper of the
peasants one way or another, nor are they capable of doing so. The interests of
the bourgeoisie demand that the old regime be not overthrown, but merely
weakened, and that a liberal Cabinet be formed.


The interests of the proletariat demand the complete overthrow of the old,
tsarist regime and the convocation of a constituent assembly with full
power. Its interests demand the most active intervention in moulding the temper
of the peasants, in choosing the most resolute forms of struggle, as well as the
best moment for it. On no account must we

with draw, 

or obscure, the slogan:
convocation of a constituent assembly by revolutionary means, i.e., through the
medium of a provisional revolutionary government. We must concentrate all
efforts on explaining the conditions for an uprising: that it must be combined
with the strike movement;

    

that all the revolutionary forces must be rallied and prepared for it, etc. We
      must resolutely take the path that was indicated in the well-known
      manifestoes: “To the Army and Navy” and “To All the
      Peasants”, which were signed by the “bloc” of all
      revolutionary organisations, including the Trudovik Group. Lastly, we
      must take special care that the government does not under any
      circumstances succeed in splitting, stopping, or weakening the incipient
      uprising by ordering elections. In this respect the lessons of the Cadet
      Duma must be absolutely binding for us, viz., the lessons that the Duma
      campaign is a subordinate and secondary form of struggle, and that, owing
      to the objective conditions of the moment, direct revolutionary actions by
      the broad mass of the people still remain the principal form of struggle.


Of course, subordinating the Duma campaign to the main struggle, assigning a
secondary role to this campaign for the contingency of an unfavourable outcome
of the battle, or postponing the battle until experience of the Second Duma is
obtained—such tactics may, if you like, be described as the old boycott
tactics. On formal grounds this description might be justified, because, apart
from the work of agitation and propaganda, which is always obligatory,
“preparation for elections” consists of minute technical
arrangements, which can very rarely be made a long time before the
elections. We do not want to argue about words; in substance these tactics are the
logical development of the old tactics, but not a repetition
of them; they are a deduction drawn from the last boycott, but not the last
boycott itself.


To sum up. We must take into account the experience of the Cadet Duma and spread
its lessons among the masses. We must prove to them that the Duma is
“useless”, that a constituent assembly is essential, that the Cadets
are wavering; we must demand that the Trudoviks throw off the yoke of the
Cadets, and we must support the former against the latter. We must recognise at
once the need for an electoral agreement between the Social-Democrats and the
Trudoviks in the event of new elections taking place. We must exert all our
efforts to counteract the government’s plan to split the uprising by ordering
elections. Advocating their tried revolutionary slogans with greater energy than
ever, Social-Democrats

    

must exert every effort to unite all the revolutionary elements and
classes more closely, to convert the upsurge that is probable in the
near future into an armed uprising of the whole people against the
tsarist government.

Proletary (The Proletarian)—an illegal
Bolshevik weekly, official organ of the R.S.D.L.P., founded in accordance with a
resolution of the Third Congress of the Party. Lenin was appoint ed
editor-in-chief by a decision of a plenary session of the Party’s Central
Committee, on April 27 (May 10), 1905.


Proletary was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) till November 12
(25), 1905, a total of twenty-six issues being brought out. Active in the work
of the editorial board were V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and
M. S. Olminsky. Proletary continued the policy of the old, Leninist
Iskra, and maintained full continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper
Vperyod.


Lenin wrote more than 50 articles and items for Proletary, his articles
being reprinted in local Bolshevik periodicals, and also published in the form
of leaflets.


Publication of Proletary was discontinued shortly after Lenin’s
departure for Russia in November 1905, the last two issues (Nos. 25 and 26)
being edited by V. V. Vorovsky.





[5]

Partiiniye Izvestia (Party News)—a newspaper,
the organ of the Joint Central Committee of the R.S,D.L.P., which was published
illegally in St. Petersburg on the eve of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the
Party. Two issues were brought out: those of February 7 (20) and March 20
(April 2), 1906. The editorial board was composed on an equal basis of editors
of the Bolshevik organ (Proletary) and the Menshevik organ (the new
Iskra). The Bolshevik members of the editorial board included Lenin,
Lunacharsky and others.


Lenin’s articles “The Present Situation in Russia and the Tactics of the
Workers’ Party”, “The Russian Revolution and the Tasks of the
Proletariat” were printed in Partiiniye Izvestia over the
signature “Bolshevik” (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 112-19,
135-45). After the Congress, publication of the newspaper was
discontinued.





[6]

The Law of December 11 (24), 1905, was the law on
elections to the State Duma. By it the voters were divided into four curias:

agricultural (landlords), urban (bourgeoisie), peasant and workers’. One
landlord vote was made equivalent in value to three votes of urban bourgeois
representatives, 15 peasant votes or 45 workers’

   

votes. The law ensured the huge preponderance of the clique of
landlords and capitalists in the Duma.





[7]

Tovarishch (The Comrade)—a 

bourgeois daily
newspaper published in St. Petersburg from March 1906 to January
1908. Formally, it was not the organ of any party, but in effect it
was an
organ of the Left Cadets. Mensheviks also contributed to the
newspaper.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Political Crisis and the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics



    


I

The dissolution of the Duma undoubtedly marked a grave
political crisis in the course of the Russian revolution. Like
every crisis, it at once extremely intensified all political antagonisms,
revealed the influences underlying many events and definitely set before the
people tasks which hitherto had been only looming, but had not yet penetrated
the minds of the broad masses. Like every crisis that comes as the climax of a
whole period of preceding development, the dissolution of the Duma inevitably
served as a touch stone for testing and verifying the various trends of opinion
on tactics. On the one hand, this crisis brings to a close a certain cycle of
development and thus enables us clearly to determine whether the general
appraisal of this development is right or wrong. On the other hand, it compels
us to give immediate answers to a number of problems which rapidly become
urgent, and these answers are often verified on the spot, so to speak, by the
rapid course of events.


The dissolution of the Duma proved to be such a “touchstone” for
the “two tactics” which have long been noticeable in the
Russian Social-Democratic movement. During the “Duma period” we
argued about these two tactics more or less calmly, as the political situation
did not call for immediate and important political decisions. The dissolution of
the Duma called for such decisions at once. The “two tactics” were
put to the test by the political crisis. The results of this test must
be closely studied.

      Lenin
The Political Crisis and the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics



    

II

The Central Committee of our Party is in the hands of the Right-wing
Social-Democrats. Prompt, precise and clear answers to the new tactical problems
were required of them. What were their answers?


To the main question concerning the general character of the impending struggle,
the Central Committee answered by proclaiming the following slogans: at the
outset “For the resumption of the Duma sessions.” The Cadets took up this
slogan (see Rech and the interview with Mr. Kedrin in the
newspaper Oko[1]).

The Social-Democratic Party rejected
it. The Bolshevik members of the Central Committee and the St. Petersburg
Committee of the Party protested. The Central Committee discarded the first
slogan and proclaimed another in its place: “In defence of the Duma
against the camarilla, for the purpose of convening a constituent assembly.”
Finally, this second slogan evolved into a third and last slogan: “For the
Duma as an organ of power which will convene the constituent assembly.” In spite
of the protests of the Left-wing Social-Democrats, the Central Committee stuck
to that slogan. On the question of slogans—utter confusion.


Another question: What form of struggle should be recommended? The Central
Committee was primarily in favour of demonstration strikes. It wanted to call
for an immediate strike, but found no support among any of the revolutionary
parties and organisations. It then signed manifestoes calling for an
uprising (the manifestoes: “To the Army and Navy” and
“To All the Russian Peasants”). But after taking a step forward from the
demonstration strike to the strike for an uprising, it took a hasty step
backward and called for “partial mass expressions of protest”.


The third fundamental question: Who shall be our ally in the struggle? Which
sections of bourgeois democracy can we depend upon, or which can we treat with
preferably? With what parties or organisations should we seek an

under standing? 

The Central Committee, as we have already seen, trimmed both its slogans and the
forms of struggle recommended by it to suit the “Duma as a whole”,
to suit the Cadets. But “drive nature out through the door and it will

    

fly in through the window”! The Central Committee was compelled to sign
    manifestoes to the army, to the peasantry and “To the Whole
    People” in conjunction only with the revolutionary
    organisations, in conjunction only with the
      “Trudoviks” (from the wreckage of the Duma). In its
    arguments on tactics, the Central Committee, like all the
    Mensheviks, draws a line of demarcation between the Cadets and the
    Octobrists: “they”—are the Right, “we”—the Left
    (“we” and the Cadets). In its tactical calls to action, in its
    fighting manifestoes, the Central Committee draws a line of demarcation
    between the Cadets and the Trudoviks; the Cadets are placed either on the
    Right or among the neutrals in the struggle. It turns out then,
    that “we” means “we” and the Trudoviks, but without
    the Cadets. It turns out, then, that “we” are an information and
    co-ordination bureau for all the revolutionary organisations,
    including the “Committee of the Trudovik Group”, but without the
    Cadets. So it is a case of “a burning desire but a bitter
    fate”. The Social-Democrats of the Right have a burning desire to go
    hand in hand with the Cadets, but their fate is a bitter one, for the Cadets
    repudiate the fighting agreements that the course of events dictates.


Such, in its main features, is the factual history of Menshevik tactics after
the dissolution of the Duma. This history is recorded in a small number of
documents. Read the “Letters” (Nos. 4 and 5) of the Central
Committee to the Party organisations, and the manifestoes “To the Army and
Navy” (signed by the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma and by the
Committee of the Trudovik Group); “To All the Russian Peasants”
(signed by the Committee of the Trudovik Group, the Social-Democratic Group in
the Duma, and the All-Russian Peasant Union, by the Central Committees of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the Social-Democratic Party, the All-Russian
Railwaymen’s Union, and the All-Russian Teachers’ Union); “To the Whole
People” (the same organisations, minus the three unions, but plus the
Polish Socialist Party and the Bund); and lastly, read the protest of the
three members of the Central Committee (published “for Party
members only”[2])

and you will have all the material
on the opportunist tactics of Social-Democrats since the dissolution of the
Duma.

 

What is the sum and substance of this factual, external history of the Menshevik
tactical directives? The sum and substance is clear: vacillation between the
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie and the revolutionary bourgeois
democrats. Indeed, what do the vacillations of the Central Committee on the
question of the slogan amount to? To vacillation between the legal
constitutional method as the exclusive, sole method (the slogan:
“Resumption of the Duma sessions”), and recognition, or admission, of the
revolutionary method (the “constituent assembly” slogan toned
down by invariable association with the Duma). This is vacillation between
the Cadets (who fully accept, and have accepted, the “resumption
of sessions” slogan) and the revolutionary peasantry (the Trudoviks, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Peasant Union, the Railwaymen’s and Teachers’
unions, who in conjunction with the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party signed the call for an uprising in favour of a
constituent assembly). Our Central Committee, or our opportunist
Social-Democrats, are only a little to the left of the Cadets, and much to the
right of the revolutionary bourgeois democrats. Such is the sum and substance of
the vacillations of the Central Committee on the question of slogans, the form
of struggle and the alignment of the political parties.


Throughout the Duma period, disagreement on tactics between the Right- and the
Left-wing Social-Democrats be came more and more marked, and centred more and
more around the main question of the line of demarcation in the ranks of the
bourgeois democrats, or the question of whom we should ally ourselves with. The
Right-wing Social-Democrats directed all their efforts towards forming an
alliance with the Cadets (support of the Duma as a whole, sup port of the demand for
a Duma Cabinet). The revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the contrary, directed
their tactics towards winning over from the Cadets the revolutionary bourgeois
democrats, towards liberating these elements from the yoke of the Cadets and
uniting them with the proletariat for militant aims. The dissolution of the
Duma was the upshot of the Duma period. And what happened? The Right wing
Social-Democrats were forced to abandon the Cadets and join the
revolutionary democrats. The only things of a

    

Cadet nature that have remained are a few frills to their slogans. The
      circumstances compelled them to draw the line of demarcation exactly where
      the Left-wing Social-Democrats have always said it should be drawn. The
      inconsistency of the Central Committee’s slogans, their futility, became
      glaringly obvious.

Lenin: 1906/politcri: III







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Political Crisis and the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics



    

III

Let us now examine the arguments of the Central Commit tee. They are set out
most fully in its fourth “letter to the Party organisations” (this
letter is neither dated nor numbered, but the next letter is called the
fifth). This letter is a truly remarkable specimen of opportunist thought: it
deserves to be published over and over again and included in socialist readers
and textbooks, as an object-lesson of how Social-Democrats should not
discuss tactics.


The kernel of this letter is its analysis of a question which the authors
themselves formulate as follows: “Into whose hands can power now pass?”
And it goes on to say:


“Who at the present time is, or can be, in the eyes of the nation
numbering 140,000,000, the natural successor to state power wrested from the
tsarist government?... For when the popular movement for winning state power
starts, the people must have a clear idea in their minds of who is to
take the place of the overthrown government.... In every given period of the
movement some association or organisation must, in the people’s mind,
play such a role.”


We have underlined the places in the argument we have quoted which at once
reveal their total fallacy. On the question of winning power, the
Central Committee at once adopts the petty-bourgeois idealist and not the
proletarian materialist point of view. It deduces “natural succession to
power from the most widespread “idea” (“in the eyes” of
the people), and not from the realities of the struggle. It fails to understand
that the “natural successor” will not be the one who, in somebody’s
“mind”, “plays such a role”, but the one who
will really overthrow the government, who will really win
power, who will be victorious in the struggle. The issue will not be
decided by the “mind of the people”, but

    

by the strength of the respective classes and elements of
society.


Thus, the Central Committee immediately flies off at a tangent from the point at
issue. Instead of examining the realities of the struggle, how it has been and
is being waged, it starts speculating, in the worst idealist manner, about
“mind” and the “idea” of who is “to take the place
of the overthrown”, and not about who does the overthrowing and will
achieve it. To arrive at these opportunist conclusions it was necessary to
discard the whole Marxist method, a method that demands a study of the question:
which interests of which classes demand that the government be
overthrown, and which—demand that its power be limited;
which material conditions give
rise to a revolutionary struggle (“overthrow”) and which—give
rise to efforts to arrange a constitutional co-habitation of the overthrown with
the overthrowers. If the Central Committee had not forgotten

the ABC of Marxism

it might have considered, if only on the basis of the experience of the Russian
revolution, which of the classes in our country are forced by the very
course of events, often irrespective of their “mind” (and even in
spite of their monarchist minds) to overthrow the governmental
institutions which stand in their way. The history of the workers’ and
peasants’ movement in twentieth-century Russia should have provided our
Central Committee with enough examples of the partial and local
overthrow of governmental institutions to enable them to conceive of
the general and complete overthrow of the central government in a Marxist
manner, and not à la Ledru-Rollin.


Having taken the wrong path, the Central Committee goes further and further
astray in its arguments on this subject. It begins to enumerate all the possible
and probable combinations in the composition of the “provisional
revolutionary government”.


The Central Committee declares that the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, and
likewise an Executive Committee composed of the Trudovik and Social-Democratic
groups in the Duma, are unsuitable. The former would not receive the backing of
the “hundred million peasants”; the latter would not receive the
backing of “any considerable section of the urban petty bourgeoisie, the
middle bourgeoisie, soldiers,

    

Cossacks, officers, etc. It would be a very dangerous error, however, to think
      that a new state power could be established against the wish of all these
      elements.”


We suggest that the reader compare the first part of these arguments with the
Bolshevik draft resolution on the provisional government (see Partiiniye
Izvestia, No. 2, March 20, 1906, reprinted in Lenin’s Report on the
Congress, p.

  92[1]

).[3]

This draft resolution precisely
enumerates the organisations which actually played the role of organs
of revolutionary power during the December uprising. In addition to the Soviets
of Workers’ Deputies, it mentions, of course, the soldiers’, railwaymen’s and
peasants’ committees, and the elected rural bodies in the Caucasus and
the Baltic Provinces. Thus, history has already provided an answer to the
problem which the Central Committee is now so helplessly trying to
solve. History has already shown which classes and which elements of the
population take part in an uprising and create the organs for
it. The opportunist Social-Democrats, however, not only forget (or fail to
understand) the recent past of the revolution, but do not understand in general
what a provisional revolutionary government is. Only a little reflection is
needed to realise that such a government is the organ of an uprising (and not
only the result of an uprising, as is mistakenly assumed in the Menshevik draft
resolution on the provisional government—see the same Report,
p. 91, or Partiiniye Izvestia, No. 2).


Further, the second part of the above-quoted argument is even more
fallacious. It is based on the usual method of the opportunists: the attempt to
prove that the most moderate slogan is the most reasonable one on the grounds
that it serves to unite the largest number of social elements. Bernstein said:
Social revolution is supported only by a section of the proletariat, whereas
social reform is supported by many social-liberal elements. Do not be misled by
the idea that socialism can be established against their wishes! It is better to
become a party of democratic socialist reforms! The Mensheviks say: Only the
proletariat and the revolutionary section of the petty bourgeoisie (primarily
the peasants) are in favour of a real victory of our revolution. But “both

    

the middle bourgeoisie and the army officers, etc.” are in favour of the
limitation of the old monarchy as proposed by the liberals. Let us, therefore,
call a deal between the liberals and the tsar a victory of the revolution, and,
in stead of a really revolutionary government as the organ of an uprising, let
us have the Duma!


No, comrades. There are things in political arithmetic a bit more complicated
than simply adding up all the “opposition” elements. The
addition of a vacillating and treacherous opposition to the actually fighting
revolutionary elements does not always produce a plus, more often it proves to
be a minus. Those whose interests compel them to strive for the
limitation of the monarchy and to fear its downfall can never create a bold and
vigorous organ of an uprising. To try in advance to fashion the future organ of
an uprising to fit these Cadet elements would be the same as trying to fashion
the social revolution in Europe to fit a Naumann or a Clemenceau.


What a comical contradiction our opportunists have landed themselves in! They
want an alliance with the middle bourgeoisie and the army officers, in short,
with the elements of the Cadet Party. But in that case they must entirely
discard the “constituent assembly” slogan, for the Cadets are
discarding it. To proclaim the “constituent assembly” slogan, which
is unpalatable to the middle bourgeoisie and the army officers, and at the same
time to try to attract them by foisting an ultra-revolutionary role on a
moderate and loyal Duma (to overthrow the government and become a provisional
revolutionary government!) —such are the depths of absurdity to which our
Central Committee has descended.


Incidentally, as regards absurdities, the Central Committee’s letter contains
even choicer gems. How do you like this one? “If, indeed, it is
impossible, at the present moment, to put forward any other body than the Soviet
of Workers’ Deputies as the instrument of power, then we can say in advance that
the victory over the government in a struggle for power (and such a
victory necessarily presupposes the participation of the army in the fight)
would lead to nothing short of a military dictatorship of the army
which had passed over ’to the side of the people’.” (The italics are in the
original.)


Just ponder over this monstrous tirade: if the Soviets

    

of Workers’ Deputies were to defeat the government with the aid of a
    section of the army, the army’s passing over “to the side of the

       people”[2]

would lead to military dictatorship!! I doubt whether such
    attempts to intimidate us with the prospect of a victorious outcome of the
    struggle could be found even in Cadet literature. I doubt whether even
    Mr. Struve went quite so far in Osvobozhdeniye,[4]

in the summer of
    1905, and in Polyarnaya Zvezda,[5]

in the spring of 1906, when he
    fulminated against the idea of an armed uprising as being a! to the idea of
    a military dictatorship. If the Central Committee had examined at least the
    ordinary demands of the soldiers and sailors during their innumerable
    “revolts” of the past year, it would have seen that these
    demands amount in fact to a demand that the caste-ridden army be
    converted into a people’s army, i.e., a militia. The soldiers and sailors
    were not always able to formulate the sub stance of their demands; indeed,
    in most cases they were unable to do so. But can anyone doubt that military
    service in the soldier’s home district and the right to hold meetings, etc.,
    is equivalent to the establishment of a militia? Has the Central Committee
    lost its elementary revolutionary instinct to such an extent that it no
    longer sees the difference between the aristocratic revolutionary spirit of
    the Decembrists[6]–the

    raznochintsi’s[7]

revolutionary spirit of the army officers in the Narodnaya
Volya[8]—and

the profoundly
democratic, proletarian and peasant revolutionary spirit of the soldiers and
sailors in twentieth-century Russia? Has it never been struck by the fundamental
difference between the revolutionary spirit of the army officers in the days of
the Narodnaya Volya, when almost complete apathy reigned in the ranks of the
soldiers, and the reactionary spirit of the army officers today, when there is a
mighty movement precisely among rank-and-file soldiers? Anyone who thinks that
if the present-day Russian soldier or sailor goes over to the side of the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies in the fight against the government it can serve
as the transition to a military dictator ship—who thinks that this can be
counteracted by winning over the army officers by means of the moderate slogan
“for

    

the Duma”—must either have lost all sense of reality, or have gone even
more to the right than Struve & Co.! The Central Committee of the
Social-Democratic Party wants to combat the strivings of the Russian soldiers
toward a military dictatorship by winning over the officers: this is what the
opportunists have brought us to!


The Central Committee tries to bolster up its hopeless case with the further
argument that there is no need for us to invent a new government, as we have the
Duma or, at any rate, remnants of it. These remnants “can declare them
selves the State Duma”, while the “popular mind, unversed in the
subtleties of a written constitution, regarded and still regards the State Duma
as the organ of power.... If the troops, refusing to obey the tsarist
government, could enter the service of the new government, that new government
would be the State Duma.”


Splendid! If tomorrow the “popular mind” should regard another legal
institution as “the government”, we must undertake to spread this
prejudice. A fine understanding of the duties of a revolutionary party, indeed!
Do try to under stand at last, dear comrades, that power must be taken by force,
by fighting, by an uprising. Are the Cadets prepared to go so far? If so, they
are welcome; we will reject no ally in this struggle. But if they are not
prepared, if they are even afraid to make a direct call for an uprising
(this, after all, is, if sincerely meant, the first step to real action, and of
all the members of the Duma only the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks have
taken it)—then all this talk about the Duma being an “organ of power
which will convene a constituent assembly” is nothing but
pernicious Manilovism[9]

and a deception of the people.


If the political atmosphere had been different the remnants of the Duma would
have acted differently, says the Central Committee in justification of the
Cadets, who were scared even by the Vyborg Manifesto. Yes, it is true, they
would have acted differently. What conclusion should be drawn from this? That we
must strive to create that different atmosphere. By what means? By
rousing the elements that are capable of fighting to revolutionary
consciousness, by raising their consciousness to a level higher than that of the
Cadets, higher than the level of Cadet slogans. But

    

you justify the timidity of the Cadets with the plea that the
    atmosphere is non-revolutionary, and at the same time you make the
    atmosphere less revolutionary by substituting Cadet slogans for
    revolutionary ones!

Narodnaya Volya (People’s Will)—the secret political
organisation of the terrorist Narodniks formed in August 1879 after the split in the
organisation Zemlya i Volya. It was headed by an Executive Committee consisting
of A. I. Zhelyahov, A. D. Mi khailov, M. F. Frolenko, N. A. Morozov, Vera
Figner, Sophia Perovskaya, A. A. Kvyatkovsky, and others.


While still adhering to the Narodnik utopian-socialist ideas, the members of
Narodnaya Volya nevertheless embarked on a political struggle, regarding the
overthrow of the autocracy and the achievement of political freedom as a major
aim. Its programme envisaged a “permanent popular representative
body” elected by universal suffrage, the proclamation of democratic
liberties, the transfer of the land to the people, and measures to put the
factories in the hands of the workers. “The Narodnaya Volya members,” Lenin
wrote, “made a step forward when they took up the political struggle, but
they failed to connect it with socialism” (see present edition, Vol. 8,
p. 72).


Narodnaya Volya fought heroically against the tsarist autocracy. But, starting
out from the erroneous theory of “active” heroes and a
“passive” mass, it expected to achieve the remaking of society
without the participation of the people, by its own efforts, through individual
terrorism that would intimidate and disorganise the government. After the
assassination of Alexander II on March 1, 1881, the government was able, by
savege reprisals, death sentences, and acts of provocation, to crush
it out of existence.


Repeated attempts to revive the organisation during the eigh ties ended in
failure. Thus, in 1886 a group in the Narodnaya Volya tradition was formed by
A. I. Ulyanov (elder brother of Lenin) and P. Y. Shevyryov; but after an
unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Alexander III in 1887, the group was
uncovered and its active members executed.


While criticising Narodnaya Volya’s erroneous, utopian programme, Lenin
expressed great respect for its members’ selfless
struggle against tsarism.

      Lenin
The Political Crisis and the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics



    

IV

The Central Committee’s practical conclusion in its famous fourth letter is as
follows: “Local mass expressions of protest must be organised at once,
everywhere.” Their object is described literally as follows:

“To create an atmosphere of preparation for the impending
decisive struggle.”

...
Not to prepare for the impending decisive struggle, but to create an
atmosphere of preparation!...


Our Party has already condemned and rejected this slogan of the Central
Committee with rare unanimity. The ’Central Committee’s campaign for
“partial mass expressions of protest” has already
failed. The absurdity of demonstrating, of organising protests, in a situation
in which civil war has attained unprecedented intensity, is too obvious. The
resolutions adopted by a large number of Party commit tees and
conferences[1]

published in this issue show clearly enough what
indignation has been roused by this slogan, as well as by the Central
Committee’s whole policy since the dissolution of the Duma. We shall not,
therefore, waste any more words on refuting a slogan that has already been
refuted by facts and rejected by the Party. We need only note, firstly, the
significance in principle of the Central Committee’s mistake, and, secondly,
its awkward attempts in letter No. 5 to extricate itself from the impossible
situation in which it found itself.


From the point of view of principle, the Central Committee’s mistake lies in
its utter failure to understand the difference between a demonstration strike
and a strike for an uprising. This is altogether unpardonable after the
experience of December. It can only be explained if we take into account that in none
of its letters has the Central Committee made any direct reference to an armed
uprising. To evade any direct raising of the question of an uprising—such
is the long-standing and constant striving of our opportunists,

    

a striving that inevitably follows from their whole position. This striving
explains why the Central Committee talks so persistently only about
demonstration strikes, and says nothing about strikes for an uprising.


Having taken up such a position, the Central Committee could not avoid lagging
behind all the other revolutionary organisations and parties. It could be said
that everyone except the opportunist Social-Democrats has realised that
the question of an uprising is bound to be raised. As was to be expected, the
All-Russian Railwaymen’s Union has paid special attention to this question. (See
its resolution and the report of the Bureau printed in this
issue.[2])

It is clearly evident from a number of manifestoes signed by several
revolutionary organisations (including the afore-mentioned manifestoes “To
the Army and Navy”, “To All the Russian Peasants”, etc.). Our
Central Committee seems to have signed these documents against its will,
contrary to its convictions!


Indeed, it is utterly impossible to sign these appeals and yet fail to see the
difference between demonstration strikes and strikes for an uprising. The
Central Committee’s inconsistency, its likeness to a weathercock, is glaring:
in its own declarations (letters No. 4 and No. 5) it does not say a word about
an uprising; but when it collaborates with other revolutionary organisations it
signs manifestoes calling for an uprising! When left to itself, our Central
Committee inevitably lapses into a Cadet policy and expends all its energy
devising slogans that would be acceptable or would seem to be acceptable to the
Cadets. When marching in line with other revolutionary organisations, it
“pulls itself together”, becomes ashamed of its Cadet slogans and
behaves properly.


This is the first time that the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party finds
itself in such an undignified position. For the first time it is being publicly
led by others. For the first time it is in the rear. Our duty, the duty of all
members of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, is at all costs and as
soon as possible to make sure that it is the first and last time.


The inability to understand the causes of the failure of the (last) July strike
is wholly due to the above-mentioned mistake on a matter of principle. Anyone
may make a mistake

    

    in fixing the moment for the struggle. We do not at all blame the
    Central Committee for that. But to mistake the character
    of an action, despite the warnings of a number of organisations in
    conjunction with which the Central Committee signed the calls for an
    uprising, that is unpardonable.


In its letter

No. 5, 

the Central Committee embarks on a petty and
trivial polemic against the Socialist-Revolutionaries (merely trying to prove
that the representative of the Trudoviks argued more consistently than the
Socialist-Revolutionary. What is the use of all this? Who is
interested in it?), and expresses surprise that it was the advanced,
class-conscious workers who failed to respond to the July strike
call. The backward workers responded to that call, but the advanced
workers did not! So the Central Committee is indignant, angry, almost abusive!


And yet, if the Central Committee had not taken up a fundamentally wrong
position, had not disagreed in principle with the vanguard of the
proletariat, it would have understood quite easily why this happened. The
backward workers might not yet have known the difference between a demonstration
strike and a strike for an uprising, but the advanced workers knew the
difference very well. When there was some hope of being able to support the
uprising in Sveaborg and Kronstadt—and there was such a
moment—the declaration of a national strike was natural. But this, of
course, would have been (and was) a strike, not with the object of
protesting against the dissolution of the Duma (as the Central Committee
imagined), but with the object of supporting the insurgents, of
extending the uprising.


In a day or two, however, it became definitely clear that the uprising in
Sveaborg and Kronstadt had been sup pressed on this occasion. A strike
in support of the insurgents was out of place, and the progressive workers had
all the time been opposed to protest strikes and demonstration
strikes. They had been saying all along in the clearest and most emphatic
language (and only our Central Committee contrived not to know, or not to
understand it) that they would go into a general decisive battle, but on no
account take part in a strike for the sake of a demonstration.


The failure of the July strike thus knocked the bottom, as it were, out of the
tactics of the opportunist Social-Democrats.

    

The idea of a demonstration strike fell through, utterly and
entirely. The slogan of “partial mass expressions of protest”
suffered the same fate.


But to anyone with the slightest knowledge of the mood of the workers in the
main centres of Russia, to anyone who has watched what is now going on among
the peasantry, it is quite clear that the idea of the strike for an uprising and
the slogan of preparing for an uprising, far from losing their importance or
clarity, are, on the contrary, everywhere maturing and gaining strength.

Lenin: 1906/politcri: V







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Political Crisis and the Bankruptcy of Opportunist Tactics



    

V

Let us now sum up our brief analysis of the Menshevik tactics during the
critical days after the dissolution of the Duma.


Throughout the Duma period the Mensheviks advocated support of the Duma as a
whole, support of the Cadets (under the guise of supporting the demand for the
appointment of a Duma Cabinet). The Bolsheviks did their utmost to split the
Trudoviks from the Cadets, and supported the idea of forming “an Executive
Committee of the Left groups in the Duma


Whose tactics have proved right now, after the dissolution of the Duma? In
conjunction with the Cadets, it was found possible to issue only the timid
Vyborg Manifesto. The Cadets as a party did not support it; they did
not participate in party agitation in support of it, nor did they pursue any
further activities on those lines. Even our Mensheviks at once
admitted that this Manifesto was inadequate. The timid Vyborg Manifesto was
followed by others, bolder and more definite. The amalgamation of some of the
individual ex-members of the Duma was followed by the amalgamation of the
“committees” of two Duma groups, which signed a number of
manifestoes and took part in a number of revolutionary conferences, and
agreed to a war council of the revolution.


What were these two groups which, as groups, as collective bodies, survived the
débâcle of the Duma, which did not lose their heads because the
“constitutional” ground had slipped from under their feet?

 

    They were the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks. The “Executive
    Committee of the Left groups”, advocated by the Bolsheviks, who
    supported the idea of forming a committee of that kind, has
    come into being. The Trudovik Group begot a new
    revolutionary organisation which has new ties with the
    peasantry; as for the Cadets, they are now politically dead, just as the
    Bolsheviks predicted, emphasising that “maggots are found near
    corpses, not near living

      people”.[1]


The fighting agreement between the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks,
Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc., has now be come a fact, documented by
the above-mentioned leaflets. We lost, and lost a great deal, of course, only
because we started late in the day, because we had not thought matters
out earlier, had not prepared the ground gradually, as the Bolsheviks
recommended long ago, in their draft resolution at the Unity Congress.


Volentem ducunt fata, nolentem trahunt—which

may be translated approximately as follows: the wise politician keeps
ahead of events, the unwise is led by them. The Bolsheviks have been
insisting for months past,
if not for a whole year, that fighting agreements with the revolutionary
democrats were inevitable; they have been insisting on the importance
of a fighting alliance between the proletariat and the advanced peasantry in
particular. The dissolution of the Duma compelled us to adopt such a
course; but the Mensheviks, as we have already shown in our analysis of all the
episodes of the Central Committee’s tactics, turned out to be unprepared, were
“led” to it against their will and contrary to their convictions by
the “unexpected” turn of events.


Take the question of an uprising. The Mensheviks did everything to
“burke” it. At the Unity Congress they even passed a resolution
against an armed uprising. Even now they say nothing about an
uprising in “letters” No. 4 and No. 5, which the Central Committee
wrote without the bid ding of other revolutionary organisations. But when it
writes anything jointly with them, and at their bidding, we read
direct and resolute calls for an uprising. Then the slogans, too, are
revolutionary. Then not a word is said about resuming

    

the sessions of the Duma, or even about convening a constituent assembly
through the medium of the Duma. On the contrary, we read the following (the
manifesto “To the Whole People”): “Not an impotent Duma,
but a constituent assembly with full power, on the basis of universal, etc.,
suffrage, this is the goal the people must strive to achieve. Not the tsar’s
Ministers, but a power backed by the revolutionary people must convene
this assembly” (our italics). This is the emphatic language our Central
Committee uses when in the company of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries, such as
the Committee of the Trudovik Group and the Polish Socialist Party!


Lastly, take the question of a provisional revolutionary government. For
eighteen months our Mensheviks, headed by Plekhanov, have been arguing that
Social-Democrats cannot participate in such a government jointly with bourgeois
revolutionaries, and that it is Blanquism, Jacobinism, and all the other mortal
sins to issue a slogan in favour of establishing a provisional revolutionary
government.


And what happened? The Duma was dissolved, and the Central Committee was
compelled to raise this very question of a provisional revolutionary
government and of how it is to be constituted. Its complete unpreparedness for
the question is apparent: it does not even understand that a provisional
revolutionary government is the organ of an uprising. The Central
Committee proposes that the remnants of the Duma, i.e., the Social-Democrats,
the Trudoviks and some of the Cadets, be proclaimed a provisional revolutionary
government. But look, comrades, see what all this amounts to: You are in
fact inviting the socialists to take part in a provisional revolutionary
government jointly with bourgeois revolutionaries! And you do this in spite
of the fact that in the company of the Trudoviks and Left Cadets the
Social-Democrats will form a negligible

minority! 

Alas, alas! The doctrinaire
talk about it being wrong for Social-Democrats to participate in a
provisional government jointly with bourgeois revolutionaries evaporates at the
first contact with reality. All the far-fetched arguments used to justify this
wrong decision with the aid of false references to Marx vanish like
smoke. Moreover, in addition to the bourgeois revolutionaries (the
Trudoviks, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the

    

      Polish Socialist Party, sections of the Peasant, Railwaymen’s and Teachers’
      unions), our “strict” pseudo-Marxists intend, by fair means or
      foul, to drag into the future provisional government the bourgeois
    compromisers (the Cadets)!


Well, it is hard to imagine a more complete fiasco for opportunist tactics
than that suffered by our Central Committee after the dissolution of the
Duma. We must pull our Party out of this mire before it is too late.

“Bloody Day” in Warsaw and other towns of Poland,[2]

the attempt on the life of Stolypin and the assassination of Min[3]

have all roused universal interest in the question of “guerrilla
actions”—we use the term which has become current among Party
members and legitimised by the resolution of the Unity Congress.


The editorial board proposes to publish in the near future an article, or
series of articles, dealing as comprehensively as possible with this extremely
important

      question.[1]

In the meantime, so as not to leave our readers in
ignorance of our views, we shall make the following brief remarks, which in
subsequent articles will be developed in detail and more precisely formulated.


First remark. Going to extremes is always bad, and there can be no doubt in the
mind of any socialist that the sentiments of the masses must be taken into
account when organising guerrilla actions. Therefore, we think that it is
absolutely necessary to take into account the opinion of the Bund (evidently in
agreement with the Polish Social-Democrats), which is familiar with the
conditions of work in Warsaw and the sentiments of the masses in that city,
namely, the opinion that the Polish Socialist Party “went too
far”. Whether it did so or not is a question of fact which we are not
competent to decide. It is never advisable to go too far, but it would be wrong
to conclude that because there have been individual cases of “going to
extremes” a certain form of struggle is no good.

 

On the whole, we consider that the intensification of guerrilla warfare in
      Russia after the dissolution of the Duma is a gain. A ruthless guerrilla
      war of extermination against the government’s perpetrators of violence
      appears to us to be timely and expedient.


Second remark. The Central Committee of our Party is certainly mistaken, and
seriously mistaken, when it says in its footnote to the fourth
“letter” (to the Party organisations): “it goes without
saying that the Party, as heretofore, repudiates so-called ’guerrilla’ militant
actions.”


This is incorrect. We abide by the decisions of the Congress, but
under no circumstances shall we submit to decisions of the Central
Committee which violate the decisions of the Congress. Anyone who takes
the trouble to examine carefully the resolution of the Unity Congress entitled:
“On Guerrilla Actions” will see without any difficulty that our
Party repudiates one form of guerrilla action, recognises
another, and recommends a third.


It entirely repudiates the expropriation of private property. It does not
repudiate the expropriation of government funds, but hedges it round with
particularly strict conditions (“if organs of revolutionary power
are formed in the given locality”, etc.).


Further, the resolution of the Congress recognises guerrilla actions
without expropriation of property, i.e., recognises
“terror”, recognises guerrilla actions for the purpose
of killing the enemy. This recognition is clearly and unambiguously expressed in
the very first words of the resolution, following the preamble:


“The Congress resolves: (1) recognising that parallel with [our
italics throughout] the preparation of the revolutionary forces for the coming
uprising, the basis of which is the organisation of the masses of the working
class, an active struggle against government terror and the
violence of the Black Hundreds will be inevitable, it is necessary...”
(then follows the prohibition of stealing, the expropriation of private funds,
etc.).


Our excerpt from the decision of the Congress is perfectly
clear. “Parallel with” work among the masses it recognises
“active struggle” against the perpetrators of violence, which

    

undoubtedly means killing them by means of “guerrilla actions”.


The only restrictions that the resolution places on this second form of
guerrilla action (the killing of perpetrators of violence) are the following:
“to avoid the violation of the personal property of
peaceful citizens except

[listen!] in those cases when it is
an unintentional result of the struggle against the government
or when, as for instance in building barricades, it is called for by
the exigencies of the immediate struggle.”


Thus, when the immediate struggle requires it, the violation of
private property is permissible, e.g., the seizure of vehicles, etc., for
barricades. When there is no immediate struggle, the Congress instructs
us to avoid disturbing the personal safety of “peaceful”
citizens; but the Congress at once points to an exception: it does
not blame participants in guerrilla actions for
“unintentional” disturbance of personal safety resulting from the
struggle against the government.


Lastly, the Congress definitely recommends to the Party a certain form
of guerrilla action, by resolving without qualifications or restrictions that:
“arms and military supplies that belong to the government must be
seized whenever an opportunity presents itself.”


For instance: policemen carry arms that belong to the government. “The
opportunity presents itself....”


Third remark. We advise all the numerous fighting groups of our Party to cease
their inactivity and undertake a number of guerrilla actions in strict
conformity with the decision of the Congress, i. e., without any expropriation
of property, with the least possible “disturbance of the personal
safety” of peaceful citizens, but with the utmost disturbance of
the personal safety of spies, active members of the Black Hundreds,
army, navy and police officers, and so on, and so forth. As for
“arms” and “military supplies that belong to the government”,
they “must be seized whenever an opportunity presents
itself”.

The “bloody day” was August 2 (15),
1906, when attacks on the police were carried out in Warsaw, Lodz, Radom, Plotsk
and other Polish towns. The action was organised by the Polish Socialist Party
(P.P.S.) (see Lenin’s note on “The Guerrilla Action of the Polish
Socialist Party” in this volume, p. 194).





[3]

The attempt on the life of Stolypin was carried out by
Socialist-Revolutionary Maximalists on August 12 (25), 1906.


General Min, who was in charge of the suppression of the December armed uprising
in Moscow, was killed by a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party on August
13 (26), 1906.

The newspaper Tovarishch publishes a note saying that Comrade
Axelrod is campaigning for a “labour congress”.[1]

We, too, have
information that the Mensheviks are in fact conducting such a campaign. We think
that open discussion of such questions is a Party duty. Or is a campaign for an
open labour congress conducted by the most prominent Mensheviks to be
concealed from the Party? If Axelrod has no opportunity of setting out
his views in print, we can offer him the columns of our newspaper.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]

The idea of convening a “labour congress”, which
was advanced by P. B. Axelrod and supported by other Mensheviks,
consisted in gathering together at a congress representatives of
various workers’ organisations to provide the basis of a legal “broad labour
party” which would include Social-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries
and anarchists. In practice this would have meant the liquidation of the
R.S.D.L.P. and its replacement by a non-party organisation. The Fifth (London)
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. emphatically condemned the Menshevik idea of a
“labour congress” and recognised that the campaign for it was
harmful to the development of proletarian class-consciousness. Together with
the Bolsheviks, the Polish and Lettish Social-Democrats combated the idea of a
“labour congress”.


For criticism of the Menshevik idea of a “labour congress” in
Lenin’s works see “Philistinism in Revolutionary Circles”,
“The Crisis of Menshevism”, “Intellectualist Warriors Against
Domination by the Intelligentsia”, “Angry Embarrassment (the
question of the labour congress)” (see present edition, Vol. 11, pp. 246-56,
341-64 and Vol. 12, pp. 316-19, 320-32).

The publication of the book Moscow in December 1905 (Moscow, 1906)
could not have been more timely. It is an urgent task of the workers’ party to
assimilate the lessons of the December uprising. Unfortunately, this book is
like a barrel of honey spoilt by a spoonful of tar: most interesting
material—despite its incompleteness—and incredibly slovenly,
incredibly trite conclusions. We shall deal with these conclusions on another

       occasion[1]

;

at present we shall turn our attention to the burning political
question of the day, to the lessons of the Moscow uprising.


The principal forms of the December movement in Moscow were the peaceful strike
and demonstrations, and these were the only forms of struggle in which the vast
majority of the workers took an active part. Yet, the December action in Moscow
vividly demonstrated that the general strike, as an independent and predominant
form of struggle, is out of date, that the movement is breaking out of these
narrow bounds with elemental and irresistible force and giving rise to the
highest form of struggle—an uprising.


In calling the strike, all the revolutionary parties, all the Moscow unions
recognised and even intuitively felt that it must inevitably grow into an
uprising. On December 6 the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies resolved to
“strive to transform the strike into an armed uprising”. As a matter
of fact, however, none of the organisations were prepared for this. Even the
Joint Council of Volunteer Fighting Squads[2]

spoke (on December 9!)
of an uprising as of something remote, and it is quite evident that it
had no hand in or control of

    

the street fighting that took place. The organisations failed to keep
      pace with the growth and range of the movement.


The strike was growing into an uprising, primarily as a result of the pressure
of the objective conditions created after October. A general strike could no
longer take the government unawares: it had already organised the forces of
counter-revolution, and they were ready for military action. The whole course of
the Russian revolution after October, and the sequence of events in Moscow in
the December days, strikingly confirmed one of Marx’s profound propositions:

revolution progresses by giving rise to a strong and united counter-revolution,
i.e., it compels the enemy to resort to more and more extreme measures of
defence and in this way devises ever more powerful means of
attack.[3]


December 7 and 8: a peaceful strike, peaceful mass demonstrations. Evening of
the 8th: the siege of the Aquarium.[4]

The morning of the 9th: the crowd in
Strastnaya Square is attacked by the dragoons. Evening: the Fiedler
building[5]

is raided. Temper rises. The unorganised street crowds,
quite spontaneously and hesitatingly, set up the first barricades.


The 10th: artillery fire is opened on the barricades and the crowds in the
streets. Barricades are set up more deliberately, and no longer in isolated
cases, but on a really mass scale. The whole population is in the streets; all
the main centres of the city are covered by a network of barricades. For several
days the volunteer fighting units wage a stubborn guerrilla battle against the
troops, which exhausts the troops and compels Dubasov[6]

to beg for
reinforcements. Only on December 15 did the superiority of the government forces
become complete, and on December 17 the Semyonovsky Regiment[7]

crushed Presnya District, the last stronghold of the
uprising.


From a strike and demonstrations to isolated barricades. From isolated
barricades to the mass erection of barricades and street fighting against the
troops. Over the heads of the organisations, the mass proletarian struggle
developed from a strike to an uprising. This is the greatest historic gain the
Russian revolution achieved in December 1905; and like all preceding gains it
was purchased at the price of enormous sacrifices. The movement was raised from
a

    

general political strike to a higher stage. It compelled the reaction to go
to the limit in its resistance, and so brought vastly nearer the moment
when the revolution will also go to the limit in applying the means of
attack. The reaction cannot go further than the shelling of barricades,
buildings and crowds. But the revolution can go very much further than the
Moscow volunteer fighting units, it can go very, very much further in breadth
and depth. And the revolution has advanced far since December. The base of the
revolutionary crisis has become immeasurably broader—the blade must now be
sharpened to a keener edge.


The proletariat sensed sooner than its leaders the change in the objective
conditions of the struggle and the need for a transition from the strike to an
uprising. As is always the case, practice marched ahead of theory. A peaceful
strike and demonstrations immediately ceased to satisfy the workers; they
asked: What is to be done next? And they demanded more resolute action. The
instructions to set up barricades reached the districts exceedingly late, when
barricades were already being erected in the centre of the city. The workers set
to work in large numbers, but even this did not satisfy them; they
wanted to know: what is to be done

next?— they 

demanded active
measures. In December, we, the leaders of the Social-Democratic proletariat,
were like a commander-in-chief who has deployed his troops in such an absurd
way that most of them took no active part in the battle. The masses of the
workers demanded, but failed to receive, instructions for resolute mass action.


Thus, nothing could be more short-sighted than Plekhanov’s view, seized upon by
all the opportunists, that the strike was untimely and should not have been
started, and that “they should not have taken to arms”. On the
contrary, we should have taken to arms more resolutely, energetically and
aggressively; we should have explained to the masses that it was impossible to
confine things to a peaceful strike and that a fearless and relentless armed
fight was necessary. And now we must at last openly and publicly admit that
political strikes are inadequate; we must carry on the widest agitation among
the masses in favour of an armed uprising and make no attempt to obscure this
question by talk about

    

“preliminary stages”, or to befog it in any way. We would be
      deceiving both ourselves and the people if we concealed from the masses
      the necessity of a desperate, bloody war of extermination, as the
      immediate task of the coming revolutionary action.


Such is the first lesson of the December events. Another lesson concerns the
character of the uprising, the methods by which it is conducted, and the
conditions which lead to the troops coming over to the side of the people. An
extremely biased view on this latter point prevails in the Right wing of our
Party. It is alleged that there is no possibility of fighting modern troops; the
troops must become revolutionary. Of course, unless the revolution assumes a
mass character and affects the troops, there can be no question of serious
struggle. That we must work among the troops goes without saying. But we must
not imagine that they will come over to our side at one stroke, as a result of
persuasion or their own convictions. The Moscow uprising clearly demonstrated
how stereotyped and lifeless this view is. As a matter of fact, the wavering of
the troops, which is inevitable in every truly popular movement, leads to a
real fight for the troops whenever the revolutionary struggle

be comes 

acute. The Moscow uprising was precisely an example of the desperate, frantic
struggle for the troops that takes place between the reaction and the
revolution. Dubasov himself declared that of the fifteen thousand men of the
Moscow garrison, only five thousand were reliable. The government restrained the
waverers by the most diverse and desperate measures: they appealed to them,
flattered them, bribed them, presented them with watches, money, etc.; they
doped them with vodka, they lied to them, threatened them, confined them to
barracks and disarmed them, and those who were suspected of being least reliable
were removed by treachery and violence. And we must have the courage to
confess, openly and unreservedly, that in this respect we lagged

be hind 

the
government. We failed to utilise the forces at our disposal for such an active,
bold, resourceful and aggressive fight for the wavering troops as that which the
government waged and won. We have carried on work in the army and we will
redouble our efforts in the future ideologically to “win over” the
troops. But we shall prove to be miserable

    

pedants if we forget that at a time of uprising there must also be a physical
struggle for the troops.


In the December days, the Moscow proletariat taught us magnificent lessons in
ideologically “winning over” the troops, as, for example, on
December 8 in Strastnaya Square, when the crowd surrounded the Cossacks, mingled
and fraternised with them, and persuaded them to turn back. Or on December 10,
in Presnya District, when two working girls, carrying a red flag in a crowd of
10,000 people, rushed out to meet the Cossacks crying: “Kill us! We will
not surrender the flag alive!” And the Cossacks were disconcerted and galloped
away, amidst the shouts from the crowd: “Hurrah for the Cossacks!” These
examples of courage and heroism should be impressed forever on the mind of the
proletariat.


But here are examples of how we lagged behind Dubasov. On December 9, soldiers
were marching down Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street singing the
Marseillaise, on their way to join the insurgents. The workers sent
delegates to meet them. Malakhov himself galloped at breakneck speed towards
them. The workers were too late, Malakhov reached them first. He delivered a
passionate speech, caused the soldiers to waver, surrounded them with dragoons,
marched them off to barracks and locked them in. Malakhov reached the soldiers
in time and we did not, although within two days 150,000 people had risen at our
call, and these could and should have organised the patrolling of the
streets. Malakhov surrounded the soldiers with dragoons, whereas we failed to
surround the Malakhovs with bomb-throwers. We could and should have done this;
and long ago the Social-Democratic press (the old
Iskra[8])

pointed out that ruthless extermination of civil and military chiefs was our
duty during an uprising. What took place in Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street was
apparently repeated in its main features in front of the Nesvizhskiye Barracks
and the Krutitskiye Barracks, and also when the workers attempted to
“withdraw” the Ekaterinoslav Regiment, and when delegates were sent
to the sappers in Alexandrov, and when the Rostov artillery on its way to Moscow
was turned back, and when the sappers were disarmed in Kolomna, and so
on. During the uprising we proved unequal to our task in the fight for the
wavering troops.

 

The December events confirmed another of Marx’s profound propositions, which
      the opportunists have forgotten, namely, that insurrection is an art and
      that the principal rule of this art is the waging of a desperately bold
      and irrevocably determined offensive.[9]

    We have
    not sufficiently assimilated this truth. We ourselves have not sufficiently
    learned, nor have we taught the masses, this art, this rule to attack at all
    costs. We must make up for this omission with all our energy. It is not
    enough to take sides on the question of political slogans; it is also
    necessary to take sides on the question of an armed uprising. Those who are
    opposed to it, those who do not prepare for it, must be ruthlessly dismissed
    from the ranks of the supporters of the revolution, sent packing to its
    enemies, to the traitors or cowards; for the day is approaching when the
    force of events and the conditions of the struggle will compel us to
    distinguish between enemies and friends according to this principle. It is
    not passivity that we should preach, not mere “waiting” until
    the troops “come over”. No! We must proclaim from the house tops
    the need for a bold offensive and armed attack, the necessity at such times
    of exterminating the persons in command of the enemy, and of a most
    energetic fight for the wavering troops.


The third great lesson taught by Moscow concerns the tactics and organisation
of the forces for an uprising. Military tactics depend on the level of military
technique. This plain truth Engels demonstrated and brought home to
all Marxists.[10]

Military technique today is not what it was in the
middle of the nineteenth century. It would be folly to contend against
artillery in crowds and defend barricades with revolvers. Kautsky was right when
he wrote that it is high time now, after Moscow, to review Engels’s conclusions,
and that Moscow had inaugurated “new barricade
tactics”.[11]

These tactics are the
tactics of guerrilla warfare. The organisation required for such tactics is
that of mobile and exceedingly small units, units of ten, three or even two
persons. We often meet Social-Democrats now who scoff whenever units of five or
three are mentioned. But scoffing is only a cheap way of ignoring the
new question of tactics and organisation raised by street fighting
under the conditions imposed by modern military technique. Study carefully the
story

    

of the Moscow uprising, gentlemen, and you will understand what connection
exists between “units of five” and the question of “new
barricade tactics”.


Moscow advanced these tactics, but failed to develop them far enough, to apply
them to any considerable extent, to a really mass extent. There were too few
volunteer fighting squads, the slogan of bold attack was not issued to the
masses of the workers and they did not apply it; the guerrilla detachments were
too uniform in character, their arms and methods were inadequate, their ability
to lead the crowd was almost undeveloped. We must make up for all this and we
shall do so by learning from the experience of Moscow, by spreading this
experience among the masses and by stimulating their creative efforts to develop
it still further. And the guerrilla warfare and mass terror that have been
taking place throughout Russia practically without a break since December, will
undoubtedly help the masses to learn the correct tactics of an
uprising. Social-Democracy must recognise this mass terror and incorporate it
into its tactics, organising and controlling it of course, subordinating it to
the interests and conditions of the working-class movement and the general
revolutionary struggle, while eliminating and ruthlessly lopping off the
“hooligan” perversion of this guerrilla warfare which was so
splendidly and ruthlessly dealt with by our Moscow comrades during the uprising
and by the Letts during the days of the famous Lettish
republics.[12]


There have been new advances in military technique in the very recent
period. The Japanese War produced the hand grenade. The small-arms factories
have placed automatic rifles on the market. Both these weapons are already being
successfully used in the Russian revolution, but to a degree that is far from
adequate. We can and must take advantage of improvements in technique, teach the
workers’ detachments to make bombs in large quantities, help them and our
fighting squads to obtain supplies of explosives, fuses and automatic rifles. If
the mass of the workers takes part in uprisings in the towns, if mass attacks
are launched on the enemy, if a determined and skilful fight is waged for the
troops, who after the Duma, after Sveaborg and Kronstadt are wavering more than
ever—and if we ensure participation

    

    of the rural areas in the general struggle—victory will be
    ours in the next all-Russian armed uprising.


Let us, then, develop our work more extensively and set our
tasks more boldly, while mastering the lessons of the great days of the Russian
revolution. The basis of our work is a correct estimate of class interests and
of the requirements of the nation’s development at the present juncture. We are
rallying, and shall continue to rally, an increasing section of the proletariat,
the peasantry and the army under the slogan of overthrowing the tsarist regime
and convening a constituent assembly by a revolutionary government. As hitherto,
the basis and chief content of our work is to develop the political
understanding of the masses. But let us not forget that, in addition to this
general, constant and fundamental task, times like the present in Russia impose
other, particular and special tasks. Let us not become pedants and philistines,
let us not evade these special tasks of the moment, these special tasks of the
given forms of struggle, by meaningless references to our permanent duties,
which remain unchanged at all times and in all circumstances.


Let us remember that a great mass struggle is approaching. It will be an armed
uprising. It must, as far as possible, be simultaneous. The masses must know that
they are entering upon an armed, bloody and desperate struggle. Contempt for
death must become widespread among them and will ensure victory. The onslaught
on the enemy must be pressed with the greatest vigour; attack, not defence, must
be the slogan of the masses; the ruthless extermination of the enemy will be
their task; the organisation of the struggle will become mobile and flexible;
the wavering elements among the troops will be drawn into active
participation. And in this momentous struggle, the party of the class-conscious
proletariat must discharge its duty to the full.

The Joint Council of Volunteer Fighting Squads was
formed in Moscow at the end of October 1905. It was created at the outset for
the practical struggle against the Black Hundreds but it was kept in existence
during the December uprising. It included representatives of the volunteer
squads of the Moscow Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the Moscow group of
Social-Democrats, the Moscow committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and
also of the volunteer squads bearing the names “Free District”,
“University”, “Typographical” and
“Caucasian”. The S.-R.-Menshevik majority

   

of the Joint Council was responsible for disorganising its activity; during the
days of the December armed uprising it lagged behind the revolutionary events
and was incapable of acting as the operational general staff of the
uprising.

Lenin cites the proposition put forward by Marx in his
Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1860 (see Marx and Engels,
Selected Works, Vol. 1, Moscow, 1958, p. 139).





[4]

During the evening of December 8 (21), 1905, soldiers and police cordoned off
the “Aquarium” garden (at the Sadovo-Triumfalnaya Square) where a
crowded meeting was being held in the theatre. Thanks to the selfless efforts of
the workers’ volunteer squads guarding the meeting, bloodshed was avoided; those
who possessed arms were enabled to escape through a broken fence, but the other
participants in the meeting who went out through the gate were searched, beaten
up and in many cases arrested.





[5]

The Fiedler school building (at Chistiye Prudy) was
regularly used for party meetings. During the evening of December 9 (22), 1905,
when a meeting was being held there, it was surrounded by troops. The
participants in the meeting, mostly members of volunteer squads, refused to
surrender and barricaded themselves in the building. The troops opened fire
using artillery and machine-guns. During the destruction of the building more
than 30 persons were killed or wounded; 120 were arrested.

of Moscow in 1905-06, who directed the suppression of the armed
uprising of the Moscow workers in December 1905.

Regiment who were sent from St. Petersburg to Moscow in December 1905 to

Iskra (The Spark)—the first all-Russian
illegal Marxist revolutionary newspaper. It was founded by Lenin in 1900, and
it played a decisive part in building the Marxist revolutionary party of the
Russian working class. After the Party, at the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1903, had split into a revolutionary (Bolshevik) wing and an
opportunist (Menshevik) wing, Iskra passed into the hands of the
Mensheviks and became known as the “new”
Iskra in contrast to Lenin’s old Iskra.





[9]

This refers to Engels’s Revolution and
Counter-Revolution in Germany, 1848 (New York Daily Tribune, 18.IX. 1852)
which was published in 1851-52 as a series of articles in the newspaper New
York Daily Tribune over the signature of Marx, who originally intended to
write them but, being preoccupied with his economic researches,
handed over the task to Engels. In writing the articles Engels

   

constantly consulted Marx, who also read them through, before they
were sent to the press. Not until 1913, as a result of the publication of
      the correspondence between Marx and Engels, did it become known that the
      work had been
written by Engels.





[10]

Engels expounded this proposition on a number of occasions in
his works, notably in Anti-Dühring.





[11]

Lenin deals with this in more detail in his work “The
Russian Revolution and the Tasks of the Proletariat” (see present
edition, Vol. 10, pp. 141-42).





[12]

In December 1905 various Lettish towns were seized by armed
detachments of insurgent workers, agricultural labourers and
peasants. Guerrilla war against the tsarist troops began. In January 1906 the
uprising in Latvia was suppressed by punitive expeditions
under tsarist generals.

We have received No. 6 of Plekhanov’s
Dnevnik[1]—twelve

small pages published in Geneva. We were agreeably surprised
to find that this time, for once, the Russian liberal-bourgeois press
refrained from praising Plekhanov. The dissolution of the Duma must have
dispelled Comrade Plekhanov’s optimism, we thought, when we found the liberal
press reporting the appearance of this issue without the usual sympathetic
quotations.


Indeed, in No. 6 of his Dnevnik Comrade Plekhanov abandons the
position of extreme Right-wing Menshevism which he occupied (with Comrade
Rakhmetov) at the time of the Duma. He completely dissociates himself from the
attempts of the Mensheviks to weaken the revolutionary slogan
“for a constituent assembly” by adding: “through the
Duma”, “for the Duma”, etc. Plekhanov rightly argues that the
only slogan possible is that for convening a constituent assembly, and he justly
criticises the Vyborg Manifesto for its omission of this slogan. Plekhanov also
completely dissociates himself from the Menshevik aim of connecting
“action” with the Duma at all costs, even if it be a partial instead
of a general action, even if it be an immediate and unprepared action instead of
a later and more mature one. And lastly, this time Plekhanov not only refrains
from adapting the slogans of Social-Democracy to those of the Cadets, or from
identifying the latter with the slogans of bourgeois democracy in general, but,
on the contrary, straightforwardly and openly criticises the lukewarmness of the
Cadets (small wonder the Cadet newspapers are now silent about Plekhanov!)
and draws a very forcible contrast between them and the
“toiling” peasantry.

 

This is all very gratifying to us. Only it is a pity that Plekhanov is still
      evasive and vacillating on a number of tactical points.


Plekhanov justly criticises the authors of the Vyborg Manifesto for
“restricting” themselves to an appeal not to pay taxes or furnish
recruits for the army, and for striving to keep within the law. They should have
said, says Plekhanov, “Prepare, for the time is approaching.” They should
have issued the slogan of a constituent assembly.


But refusal to pay taxes, etc., is a means of waging the struggle. The
convocation of a constituent assembly is the immediate object of the
struggle. In reproaching the Cadets for wanting to restrict themselves only to
one means, he should have pointed to other means and analysed the
conditions under which they can be applied, their significance, etc. To evade this
question, as Plekhanov did, with the re mark “sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof”, is wrong. The Social-Democratic Party must guide the
proletariat not only in presenting the right slogans, but also in choosing the
most effective and expedient means of struggle. The Russian revolution
has already given us much evidence showing that as the objects of the struggle
become wider and as the numbers participating in the struggle increase, there is
a corresponding change in the means and methods of struggle, which become more
drastic and aggressive. Particularly at a moment like the present, it is our
duty not to remain silent on this question, but to make a careful study of
various means of struggle, such as: the political strike, the armed uprising,
etc. These are burning issues; and the advanced workers are rightly demanding an
answer to these questions from us.


Analysing the relation between the interests of the various classes and the
demand for a constituent assembly, Plekhanov distinguishes three
classes.

(1) As regards the proletariat, he states that its class interests
entirely coincide with the interests of the nation as a whole.

(2) As regards
the “toiling peasantry”, he notes the possibility that, under
certain circumstances, their interests might diverge from those of the nation as
a whole; but he emphasises that “their class interests” demand the
convocation of a constituent assembly.

(3) As regards “those strata which
are represented by the

    

Constitutional-Democratic Party”, Plekhanov admits that their “class
interests” will make them mistrustful of the con vocation of a constituent
assembly; that this will prove that they are “reconciled” to the
actions of Stolypin & Co., that they are afraid of losing the big landed
estates without compensation, etc. And Plekhanov states that he “does not
pro pose to prophesy” whether among the Cadets class interests will
outweigh the interests of the nation, or vice versa.


Prophecies refer to the future, but the repudiation of the constituent assembly
slogan and of the revolutionary struggle for it by the Cadets is a fact of the
present. To hush it up is not only futile but harmful. But if it is not hushed
up, then obviously it should be admitted that:

“The proletariat together with the politically conscious toiling
peasantry are opposed to the unreliable and vacillating Cadets.”
Plekhanov has now come very close to this tactical line, which logically follows
from his present formulation of the question.


He writes: “All the parties which are taking part in this movement [the
struggle for a constituent assembly] should immediately come to an agreement for
mutual assistance.” Quite right! Which parties are these? Those to the
Left of the Cadets, and which should be called the parties of the
revolutionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats (for the
constituent assembly slogan is a revolutionary slogan, in contrast to
the oppositional and “loyal” slogan of the Cadets:
“A new Duma as soon as possible”). Thus, a fighting agreement between
the party of the proletariat and the parties of the revolutionary democrats.


That is just what we have always insisted on. It only re mains for us to express
the wish that Plekhanov will hence forth consistently carry out this policy. And
carrying it out consistently means making this fighting agreement
conditional not only on the recognition of the
revolutionary-democratic slogan (a constituent assembly), but also on
the recognition of the revolutionary means of struggle for which our movement
has already matured, and which it will inevitably have to apply in fighting for
a constituent assembly, in other words, the recognition of a people’s
uprising. Further, to make the constituent assembly slogan really clear and
not merely to repeat it, we must raise the question of a

    

provisional revolutionary government. By failing to raise this question
    Plekhanov fails to delimit properly the interests of the
    “toiling” peasantry and the class interests of “those
    strata which are represented by the Cadet Party”. By failing to raise
    this question Plekhanov leaves a yawning gap in our propaganda and
    agitation, for every agitator will be asked: Who, in the opinion of the
    workers’ party, is to convene the constituent assembly?


As we have already stated, Plekhanov quite groundlessly evades the question of
an uprising as well as the question of the means of struggle in general. lie
writes: “At the present time an uprising could only be an outbreak of
popular indignation, only a riot, which would easily be suppressed by the
authorities; but what we want is not riots or outbreaks; we want a victorious
revolution.”


This is just as if Nogi, in August 1905, had said: “What we want is
not an attack on Port Arthur, but the capture of Port Arthur.”
Untimely attacks may be contrasted to timely attacks, ill-prepared to
well-prepared attacks; but attacks in general cannot be contrasted to
“capturing” a fortress. That would be a mistake. It would be an
evasion of the question of the means of capturing the fortress. And it is
precisely this mistake Comrade Plekhanov makes.


Either he is not saying all he thinks, or he himself is not clear about the
question.


The difference between a demonstration strike and a strike for an uprising is
clear. The difference between “partial mass expressions of protest”
and a general, all-Russian action is clear. So is the difference between partial
and local risings and a general, all-Russian uprising, supported by all
the revolutionary parties and elements. If you call demonstrations, partial
protests, partial risings—“outbreaks”, people will understand what
you mean, and your protests against “putsches” will be
perfectly justified.


But to say: “we want not outbreaks, but a victorious
revolution”, means to say nothing. Even worse, it is a platitude made to
sound significant. It is a resounding but meaning less phrase intended to
befuddle the reader. It would be very difficult to find two sane
revolutionaries who would not agree that we want “not outbreaks,
but a victorious revolution”. But neither would it be very easy to find
two sane

    

revolutionaries who would agree as to what particular means of
struggle at what particular moment would be, not an
“outbreak”, but a real step towards a victorious revolution.
Plekhanov does not make much progress by looking wise and repeating things which
nobody has any doubt about and evading the really difficult part of the problem.


In conclusion, we must add that Plekhanov naturally has a passing
“thrust” at the Bolsheviks: they are “Blanquists”,
because they boycott the Duma, and “frivolous”, because, he alleges,
they were unaware (until enlightened by Comrade Plekhanov in No. 6 of his
Dnevnik) that it was necessary to increase activities among the
troops. We think it sufficient just to mention these thrusts; they are
not worth answering. If Comrade Plekhanov imagines that by his present
tactics he is strengthening the Menshevik wing in our Party and weakening the
Bolsheviks, we have no objection to leaving him in this state of blissful
delusion.

About eighteen months ago one of the humorous periodicals published by the
German Social-Democrats contained a cartoon strip of Nicholas II. The tsar was
depicted in military uniform and laughing. He was teasing a shaggy peasant with
a crust of bread, now putting it almost into his mouth, now snatching it
away. The face of the shaggy peasant now shone with a smile of satisfaction, now
frowned with vexation as the bread was snatched away just as he snapped at
it. The lettering on this crust of bread was “constitution”. The
last “scene” however, shows that the peasant, after a desperate
effort to bite off a morsel of bread, had bitten off the head of Nicholas
Romanov.


This was a very apt cartoon. For some years, in fact, the autocracy has been
“teasing” the Russian people with a constitution, a constitution
that was just on the point of being “almost completely” granted,
only to be withdrawn and replaced the next moment by the same old tyranny, the
same police system of abuses and iniquities in a much worse form. How long is it
since we had almost the most democratic “parliament” in the world?
How long is it since the whole press was discussing the question of a Cadet
Cabinet as an immediate and real possibility? It is hard to believe that this
was only two or three months ago. A couple of ukases, manifestoes and
ordinances, and the old autocracy is again reigning supreme, the gang of
universally condemned, discredited and publicly execrated embezzlers, hangmen
and pogrom-mongers are hard at it again, heaping indignities upon the people,
wrecking, robbing, beating, gagging, poisoning the air with the unbearable
stench of serfdom.

 

From the standpoint of the development of the revolutionary struggle of the
people, these rapid changes from short “days of freedom” to long
months of rabid reaction are due to the equilibrium which has set in between the
conflicting forces since last autumn. The autocracy is no longer strong
enough to rule the people, the people are not yet strong enough to
shake off this pogrom-mongering government. So the two conflicting forces stand
facing each other like rival armies, now resting from the struggle for a time in
order to recuperate, now hurling themselves anew into the battle against the
hated enemy.


The publicists of the Cadet press and the Novoye Vremya
press[1]

are essentially alike in their moralising estimate of these
vacillations. Both condemn and deplore the vacillation, indecision and wavering
of the government, and exhort it to be “firm”—one lot demanding
firmness in repression, the other demanding firmness in establishing the
promised constitution. None of them has any conception of the class struggle
that is changing the actual alignment of social forces.


As this struggle develops, class-consciousness and solidarity will inevitably
grow in the ranks of the revolution and in the ranks of reaction, and sharper
and more ruthless forms of struggle will inevitably be adopted. Nothing could be
more effective than these rapid transitions from “days of freedom”
to “months of shooting” in diminishing the ranks of the passive and
indifferent, in drawing new strata and elements into the struggle, in developing
the class-consciousness of the masses by throwing into vivid relief first one
and then another aspect of the autocracy through the various experiments which
have been made throughout Russia. The quicker and the sharper these transitions
occur, the sooner will matters come to a head owing to the inevitable
preponderance of the social forces on the side of freedom.


The class-conscious workers can therefore view quite unperturbed the
astoundingly rapid “progress” of the autocracy on the path of
repression. Keep it up, Messrs. Romanov, Trepov, Ignatyev and Stolypin! The
more zealously you keep to that path, the sooner will you exhaust your last
reserves. Do you threaten us with a military

dictator ship, 

to put the whole of Russia under martial law? But it

    

      is certainly the revolution that stands to gain most of all from such martial
      law. A military dictatorship and martial law will necessitate the
      mobilisation of increasing masses of troops, but the repeated
      mobilisations of the most “reliable” troops—the
      Cossacks—have already caused greatly in creased discontent in the
      ruined Cossack villages and have increased the “unreliability”
      of these troops. Martial law costs money, and the autocracy’s finances are
      already in a desperate condition. Martial law leads to increased
      agitation among the soldiers and teaches the population to be undaunted even
      by. the most “frightful” forms of repression; Poland and the
      Baltic Provinces are eloquent proof of this.


We said that the reaction is “threatening” us with a military
dictatorship. This, strictly speaking, is incorrect, for now, after the
introduction of military courts[2]

in nearly all the provinces,
including the “border regions”, i.e., in 82 out of the 87 provinces
in the Empire, it is ridiculous to speak of a military dictatorship as a matter
of the future. It is already present, and a change in name, the use of a more
“frightful” word (“dictatorship” instead of
“special emergency measures”), the appointment of a single dictator
cannot add one jot to the system of wholesale arrests, deportations
without trial, punitive expeditions, searching people in the street and shooting
by order of army officers. A military and police dictatorship already reigns in
Russia. These measures of repression have gone so far that revolutionaries who
have been accustomed to such “treatment” ever since the days of
Plehve, suffer from them relatively little; the brunt of them falls on the
“peaceful” population, whom the Stolypins are
“agitating” with most commendable success.


The measures of repression carried out in the winter followed a real
revolutionary uprising with which the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie had no
sympathy, and yet it was these measures that produced an all-opposition Duma
from which the revolutionary elements benefited most. The measures of
repression in the autumn follow upon a phase of legal
“constitutionalism”. It cannot be that they will result
only in a more radical Duma.


The gang of pogrom-mongers feels that repression is futile and is desperately
looking for support. On the one hand, the attempts to come to terms with the
Octobrists

    

have failed; on the other, Pobedonostsev & Co. are preparing to make a clean
sweep of all “constitutions”. On the one hand, the universities are
being re-opened and the venal press is clamouring for a strong liberal
policy. On the other hand, even the congress of the Cadet Party is prohibited
(how Stolypin & Co. are helping those Cadets!), and the press is being
persecuted worse than under Durnovo. On the one hand—military courts; on
the other—a broadly conceived attempt to come to terms with the
rural bourgeoisie.[3]


The government feels that its only salvation lies in strengthening the rural,
muzhik bourgeoisie in the village communes as a bulwark against the mass of the
peasantry. But instead of approaching this objective with considered and
cautious steps, as Guchkov & Co. would have done, instead of stealing up to
it in a skilful and subtle way, as the Cadets are doing, the police
Derzhimordas[4]

go about it so crudely, stupidly and clumsily that it is
more than probable that their whole “campaign” will end in a
fiasco. The peas ant bourgeois element is numerically weak, but economically it
is very strong in the countryside. Provision of land from landlords, as well as
other land, by redemption payments in accordance with the Cadet agrarian reform
would have given some slight satisfaction to the whole of the
peasantry and would have admirably achieved the aim towards which the autocracy is
“pushing forward” clumsily, namely:

it would have enormously
strengthened the peasant bourgeoisie and made it a bulwark of
“order”.


The Romanovs, Trepovs, Ignatyevs and Stolypins, how ever, are too dense to see
this. In the Duma they brusquely refused to give land to the peasants and now
they are putting up crown and state lands for sale through the
officials. Whether this will actually induce the influential sections of the
rural bourgeoisie to take the side of the present government is a big
question, for the pack of officials will procrastinate, rob and take bribes as
the Romanovs and their gang have always done. That the masses of the peasantry
will get “heated up” more than ever when they hear about the sale of
crown and state lands is beyond doubt. In very many cases these sales will mean
that the peasants will have to pay more, for rent will be converted
into redemption payments. And to compel the peasants to pay more for their

    

land is the best thing the government, could think of doing to facilitate our
      agitation against the government. It is an excellent way to exasperate the
      peasants more than ever and to swing them over to our slogan:
    absolute refusal to make any payments for the land, the
    whole of which must go to the peasants after the victory of the
    revolution.


The government’s ineptitude in its flirtation with the peasant bourgeoisie is
due partly to the stupidity characteristic of every police government, and
partly to extreme shortage of funds. The finances are in a very bad way.
Bankruptcy threatens. Foreign countries are refusing to lend money. The internal
loan is not being taken up. It has to be forcibly and secretly raised
from the capital of the savings-banks, secretly because the
savings-banks depositors would be least of all disposed to buy government bonds
now. The autocracy’s lackeys are beginning to sense the inevitability of the
collapse of the gold currency and of unlimited issue of paper currency.


Keep it up, Stolypin & Co.! You are doing good work for us! You are rousing
the population better than we ourselves could do it. You have gone to the limit
with your measures of repression, thus demonstrating to all that the militant,
revolutionary onslaught, too, must go to the limit.

Novoye Vremya (New Times)—a daily newspaper
published in St. Petersburg from 1868 to October 1917. Under various editors it
repeatedly changed its political trend. Moderately liberal at the outset, after
1876 under the editorship of A. S. Suvorin it became the organ of reactionary
circles of the nobility and the bureaucracy. Following 1905 it became an organ
of the Black Hundreds After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917
it supported the counter-revolutionary policy of the bourgeois Provisional
Government and rabidly vilified the Bolsheviks. The newspaper was closed down by
the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet on October 26
(November 8), 1917. Lenin called Novoye Vremya the acme of venality in
the press. He wrote:

“Novoye Vremya-ism became an expression equivalent to the
concepts: apostasy, renegacy, toadyism” (Collected Works, 4th Russ.
ed., Vol. 18).

The military courts were established by a Council of Ministers decree of August
19 (September 1), 1906, for combating the revolutionary movement. They were
introduced by the Governor-General, the head of the administration or persons
vested with equivalent authority in localities declared to be under a state of
siege or under special emergency regulations. The military court consisted of a
chairman and four members from army or naval officers and was endowed with wide
powers. The decree on military courts gave the authorities the right to hand

The book Moscow in December 190S deals with events of tremendous
importance in the history of the Russian revolution. As regards the positive
conclusions to be drawn from the Moscow uprising, we gave them in general
outline in our last

issue.[1]

Here we shall dwell on those aspects of this
important, but badly executed, piece of work which have special reference to the
Social-Democrats in Moscow.


The “compilers” of this book state in their preface that they used
material supplied by Social-Democratic organisations, which, however, “as
such have no connection with this work”. It goes without saying that it is
extremely irregular for Social-Democratic organisations to supply such in
formation to persons who are not responsible to these organisations. The
organisations of the workers’ party have now undoubtedly been put in an
awkward position by the slovenly treatment of their materials and by
the choice assortment of banalities with which these have been
“ornamented”. All the Moscow Social-Democratic
organisations, and
primarily, of course, their leading body—the Moscow Committee—must,
in our opinion, consider this matter and take measures to prevent a recurrence
of such irregularities.


Here is one of the many instances of how the anonymous authors of the book
“treat” the material supplied to them by the Social-Democratic
organisations. The authors deal with the role of the revolutionary organisations
in the Moscow events, and, in particular, with the Manifesto of the Combat
Organisation of the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party, published on December

    

 11, in No. 5 of Izvestia Sovetov Rabochikh Deputatov.[2]

Without giving any coherent account of the contents and character of this document,
    the authors give rein to their profundity by the following criticism. They
    quote No. 5: ’The fighting is at its height. For many hours a number of
    sanguinary battles were fought in the streets of Moscow between the people
    in revolt and the tsar’s troops”, and they “criticise” as
    follows: “We know that there were only minor skirmishes between troops
    and a few fighting squads in the streets of Moscow.” And with mock passion
    they cry out against this “substitution [sic!] of the action of
    handfuls of armed men for mass struggle”, and exclaim:

“Where did the masses come in, how could they display activity?” etc.,
etc.


What is this?? Can these efforts to appear profound by such methods of
“criticism” be called a scientific analysis?? Just think: in a
serious historical work, in a special chapter devoted to the part played by the
revolutionary organisations, the authors try to find fault with the fact that
on

December 11, 

i.e., a few days before the crisis, when
new methods of struggle were just beginning to be applied, the Soviet
of Workers’ Deputies dared to speak of “a people in revolt”! Perhaps it
should have spoken of “a few fighting squads” in a profoundly
condescending tone and not have called on the people and the masses to assist in
the fight that was beginning? What term but cheap can we apply to these
doctrinaire efforts to be “clever”, these verbal quibbles, when you
find these very same “compilers” in a number of pas sages
in their book referring to the people as a whole, the “whole
population” turning out on the streets? Do try to understand, you pitiful
creatures, that to be a member of a revolutionary organisation in Moscow on
December 11, and yet not to speak of the people in revolt
could only mean that the one who kept silent was a member of the Black Hundreds
or a soulless pedant like Pollack in Leonid Andreyev’s To the
Stars.[3]


Let us proceed. As regards the Manifesto issued by the Combat Organisation and
published in the same issue of Izvestia (No. 5), the compilers say with
a sneer: “Squads of three or four persons, in the opinion of the authors
of the manifesto, were to present [!] the people with a capital

    

city freed from centuries of oppression.” “The Combat Organisation decided
that there was no need f or the masses to act.”


Let us turn to the Manifesto. The compilers of this book do not print
it in full; they only give excerpts from it. But even in the excerpts
chosen by these “investigators” we read a direct call of
the Combat Organisation: “Organise as many of these squads as
possible.” Thus, the idea of “presenting” something to the
people, the idea that “there was no need for the masses to
act”, is imputed to those who from the very first day of the armed
struggle called upon “as many workers as possible” to join the
fighting squads....


What is this? Literary slovenliness or hack literature? The authors make no
attempt whatever to analyse the connection between military organisation and
military technique, the functions and interrelation of the direct armed fight
and the auxiliary struggle. They shut their eyes to the past, they forget that
both general strikes and demonstrations in Russia began with a very small, even
insignificant number of participants, judged by present-day standards. Of a
serious historical approach there is not a hint—nothing but truly
nauseating attacks. The Manifesto of the Combat Organisation is quoted on page
145 in fragments, in order to distort its meaning; only further on (page 154) is
it mentioned in passing that the Manifesto contains an instruction to
“spare the lives of infantrymen”, i.e., directly reckons
with the psychology of the masses, making a clear distinction between
Black-Hundred troops and wavering troops. But the Manifesto of the Octobrists,
which had no bearing whatever on the study of the Moscow uprising, is printed
in full!


Social-Democratic organisations have entrusted information to persons who print
the Manifesto of the Octobrists in full, yet tear fragments out of the
manifestoes of the Combat Organisation of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies for
banal exercises in commonplace witticisms....


Let us pass on to the conclusions drawn by the compilers:

“The proletariat, as a mass, did not go into action”
(p. 245).

“The Moscow proletariat did not go into action either on
December 9-10 ... or on the following days. This does credit to its intelligence
and discipline” (p. 244).

 

Do you hear, comrade workers: it is suggested that it is to your
      “credit” that the masses did not fight enough!! The fact that
      the masses of the workers took an inadequate part in the active,
      aggressive struggle is, if you please, a point in their favour. And the
      fact that the masses of the workers forged ahead of their leaders and
      proceeded to build barricades on a large scale, that they were constantly
      pressing their leaders to call for more drastic action, must no doubt be
      held against them....


“The events in Moscow,” say the compilers, “prove that in the present
historical period, in which militarism has been developed to an enormous degree,
a necessary condition for the victory of the people in revolt is that a
considerable part of the army should actively go over to the side of the
insurgent population, or that the masses of the soldiers should categorically
refuse to use arms against the people....”


Our wiseacres failed to understand or even to notice the struggle that went on
to win over the vacillating troops. Evidently they think that an uprising is
possible without having to fight the Black-Hundred section of the troops,
without an active struggle on the part of the revolutionary people, which throws
the ranks of the army into confusion. They have adopted the standpoint of the
Cadets, who are ready to welcome the “going over” of the troops, but
who declare that an armed uprising or propaganda for it is criminal
folly”....


... “But such action on the part of the troops is conceivable only towards the
end [sic!] of a revolution, which moreover must involve the whole of
the people. The December uprising of the proletariat, which enjoyed only the
passive [?] sympathy of the mass of the bourgeois population, its actions
in pursuit of its own slogans [our italics], could not [!] find support in
the army, and therefore the

’attempt to convert the general strike into an armed
uprising’ could not be crowned with success and must be regarded as a
historical blunder.”


Let this be a lesson to you, workers of Moscow! Don’t fight for “your own
slogans”!...


It is hard to imagine how people could sink to such depths of pedantry, to such
Cadet-like poverty of thought, to drawing such banal conclusions from serious
historical material.

    

Let the Moscow Social-Democrats express their indignation to the authors of this
book and call on all Party members and revolutionaries to collect materials for
a worthy account and serious criticism of the December uprising. Let all its
mistakes and shortcomings be ruthlessly exposed for the instruction of the
fighting proletariat. But to the Cadets and the literary hacks the party of the
proletariat must say, “Hands off!”

Our Unity Congress undoubtedly rejected all “expropriations”, so
that on this score the Polish Socialist Party’s references to the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party are quite irrelevant. Nor is there any doubt that
in organising the “action” of August 2 (15) the Polish Socialist
Party failed to consider either its expediency, the temper of the masses, or the
conditions of the working-class movement. Obviously, all these factors must be
taken into account, and this is emphasised in a special paragraph of the
Bolshevik draft resolution on guerrilla actions. In our opinion, however, it is
the Polish Socialist Party’s distortion of guerrilla tactics that
deserves condemnation, not these “tactics” as such. Our Polish
Social-Democratic comrades would certainly have approved of such guerrilla
action as the wrecking of the Black-Hundred “Tver”
inn[2]

by the St. Petersburg workers last year.

The Seventh Congress of the Bund, the organisation of the Jewish
Social-Democratic workers of Russia, has re cently taken place. According to the
reports of this Congress, the total number of members of the Bund amounts to
33,000 in 257 organisations. Representation at the Congress was organised on a
democratic basis, with one delegate for each 300 members of the Party. About
23,000 members took part in the elections and they sent to the Congress 68
delegates with the right to speak and vote.


The chief question that the Congress had to decide was that of the union of the
Bund with the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. As is known, the Unity
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. pronounced in favour of unification and laid down the
conditions for it. The Seventh Congress of the Bund has now accepted these
conditions. Union with the R.S.D.L.P. was adopted by 48 votes against 20. Thus,
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has at last become a truly
all-Russian and united organisation. The member ship of our Party is now
over 100,000: 31,000 were repre sented at the Unity Congress, and then
there are about 26,000 Polish Social-Democrats, about 14,000 Lettish and 33,000
Jewish Social-Democrats.


Representatives of the Central Committee of the Bund joined the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. The rather difficult work of unifying the local
organisations of the Bund and those of the R.S.D.L.P. now lies ahead.


The second question discussed at the Bund Congress was that of the present
political situation. In a detailed resolution,

    

adopted by a large majority of votes, the Seventh Congress of the Bund
    accepted the convocation of a constituent assembly as a
    tactical slogan, and rejected all reservations tending to weaken this
    slogan, such as “through the Duma”, etc. Boycott of the Duma was
    rejected condition ally, that is to say, the necessity of taking part in the
    elections was recognised provided that the party of the proletariat was in
    a position to carry out an independent election campaign.


The third question was that of “guerrilla actions”, without any
division of them into “expropriations” and terrorist acts. By an
overwhelming majority, a resolution against guerrilla actions was
adopted.


The last question concerned the organisation of the Bund. Organisational rules
were adopted.


We limit ourselves to this short note for the time being; we hope in the near
future to acquaint our readers more fully with the decisions of the Seventh
Congress of the Bund.

As early as the beginning of 1905 the Social-Democrats pointed
out that the draft programme of the S.-R. (Socialist Revolutionary) Party marked
a definite turn “from Narodism[5]

to

      Marxism”.[1]

It was obvious that the party making this turn was bound to undergo internal
disintegration.


The ideological and political disintegration of the Socialist-Revolutionary
Party is now a fact. The Minutes of the First Congress of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party, published in book form in Paris this year,
clearly indicate all the lines of this disintegration. The current political
literature of the “Maximalists” and of the representatives of the
nascent “Toilers’ Popular Socialist Party” has conclusively
revealed the full extent of this disintegration.


The two big splits which occurred in the ranks of Social-Democracy—the
split between the “Economists”[6]

and the old
Iskrists in 1900-03, and the split between the “Mensheviks” and
“Bolsheviks” in 1903-06—were the result of an acute struggle
between two trends characteristic of the whole international socialist movement,
viz., the opportunist trend and the revolutionary trend, in their peculiar forms
corresponding to particular stages of the Russian revolution. The
Socialist-Revolutionary Party, however, at the very first attempt at anything
like a public statement testifying to its having a real party character, split
up into three trends:

(1) the Left—the “Maximalists”;

(2) the Centre—the S.-R.’s of the old type; and

(3) the Right—the
opportunists (otherwise called “Legalists”, “Toilers’ Popular
Socialists”, etc.) with whom we shall deal in the present article. The

    

contours of all three trends can be clearly seen from the Minutes of the
      First Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. We have now a
    vivid literary expression of the trends which have broken away (or are
    breaking away?) from the “Centre”. The Maximalists have
    published Straight to the Goal and a detailed programmatic pamphlet
    by Mr. Tag—in,[7]

entitled: Principles of Labour
      Theory. The opportunist Socialist-Revolutionaries have expressed
    their views, carried almost to their logical conclusion, in the writings of
    Mr. Peshekhonov & Co. Mr. Chernov, the representative of the
    “Centre”, was quite right in his article in Mysl (or
    maybe Golos, Dyelo Naroda,[8]

etc.) in calling the
    Maximalists “vulgar socialists”, but, if we are not mistaken, he
    has said nothing in the press so far about the opportunist
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. The concubinage of the Socialist-Revolutionary
    “marsh” and the Socialist-Revolutionary “extreme
    Right” in these newspapers was not without effect.


The division of the supporters of the “labour principle”, the
admirers of Lavrov and Mikhailovsky, into three trends is an important political
event in the history of Russian petty-bourgeois radicalism. Marxists must pay
full attention to this event, for it throws a sidelight on the trend of the
maturing political thought of the awakening Russian peasantry.


The main contradiction in the programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries is
their oscillation between Narodism and Marxism. Marxism demands that a clear
distinction be made between the maximum programme and the minimum
programme. The maximum programme is the socialist transformation of society, which
is impossible without the abolition of commodity production. The
minimum programme proposes reforms that are possible even within the limits of
commodity production. Confusion of the two inevitably leads to all sorts of
petty-bourgeois and opportunist, or anarchist, perversions of proletarian
socialism and inevitably obscures the objects of the social revolution
to be achieved through the conquest of political power by the proletariat.


From the standpoint of the old Russian Narodism, of the principles of Lavrov,
V. V., Mikhailovsky & Co., the distinction between the maximum programme
and the mini mum programme is superfluous and incomprehensible, for

    

the theory of Narodism denies that the laws and categories of commodity
production can be applied to Russian peasant economy. The more or less
consistent disciples of Lavrov and Mikhailovsky (as well as of
V. V. and Nikolai—on[9]


who are undeservedly forgotten, for present-day Narodniks
have no other source of economic ideas) were inevitably bound
to be hostile to this Marxist division of the programme into a maximum
and a minimum. And the very first attempt of the Socialist-Revolutionaries to
transform their circles into a party revealed the strength and trend of this
hostility. The supporters of the revolutionary trends in Narodism asked: Why
demand only the socialisation of the land? We demand the socialisation of the
mills and factories too! Down with the minimum programme! We are Maximalists!
Down with the theory of commodity production!


Actually, this Maximalist trend almost coincides with anarchism, as one would
expect.


The supporters of the opportunist trends in Narodism, the Narodniks of the
eighties, raised another cry: What earthly use is a maximum programme, or
proletarian dictatorship? Socialism is a remote prospect! Why frighten the
masses away with a name like “Socialist-Revolutionaries”? Why
demand a “republic”? What’s the use of an illegal party? Down with the
whole lot! Down with the maximum programme! Down with the
“dangerous” clauses of the minimum programme! Instead of a
programme, let us have a “platform” of an open, legal,
non-republican “Toilers’ Popular Socialist

       Party”![2]


Against either of these tendencies the S.-R. Centrists, the old members of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party, have no other defence than to invoke the
laws of commodity production and virtually to adopt the standpoint of
Marxism. The accusations levelled at the S.-R. Centre by the Right and the Left
at the First Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, namely that the
S.-R. Centre was Marxist, that it wanted to compete with the Social-Democrats,
to start out from Social-Democratic principles, were therefore

    

quite justified. This Centre’s transition to Social-Democracy is now simply a
      matter of time. And the sooner the revolutionary parties can exist quite
      openly, the sooner that time will come. No prejudices against Marxist
      “dogmatism” can withstand the inexorable logic of events.


The brief existence of the Cadet Duma coincided with the first appearance of
representatives of the peasant masses in the general Russian political arena. It
was inevitable that the Socialist-Revolutionaries should seek an understanding
with these representatives and try to organise them politically on the basis of
their Socialist-Revolutionary programme. It turned out that the
Social-Democrats had, in a comparatively short time, formed a Social-Democratic
Party Group in the Duma. The S.-R.’s, on the other hand, were never
able to act except behind the backs of the Trudoviks. In political solidarity
the small producer at once proved to be far inferior to the working
class. Moreover, even behind the backs of the Trudoviks the
Socialist-Revolutionaries were unable to carry through a united
political campaign. On the land question, which is the basic question for the
peasantry, the split between the opportunists and the Centrist S.-R.’s was soon
revealed. In the arena of “parliamentary action, the former gained the
victory among the representatives of the masses: they rallied 104 Trudoviks for
the opportunist Land Bill,[10]

whereas only 33 Trudoviks (out
of the same 104) subsequently supported the Land Bill that corresponded to the
programme of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.


This split, which occurred in an open political action in the sight of the whole
people, inevitably led to the systematisation of the disagreements which had
caused it. Mr. Peshekhonov, one of the leaders of the S.-R. opportunists, went
further than anyone else in this systematisation. Here are his views, his
“outlines and scope of the platform”... of the peasant Cadets:


“The revolutionary demands must conform to and be commensurate with the
revolutionary forces” (p. 194, Russkoye Bogatstvo,
No. 8). Therefore “the line of land and liberty” must not be
“carried too far”. Instead of the maximum and minimum programme of
“the two socialist parties, the Social-Democrats and the
Socialist-Revolutionaries”, the petty

    

bourgeois needs a united “platform” to serve as “a
plan of campaign, not for a long period (right until socialism), but only for
the immediate future”. The rest of the road to the final goal is a
“remote prospect” (p. 196). Therefore, the republic
must be deleted from this “platform”: “We must reckon
with the psychological factor.... The monarchist idea is too deeply rooted in
the popular mind.... A thou sand years have not passed in vain.... This
psychology of the broad masses must be reckoned with.... The question of the
republic calls for extreme caution” (198). The same with the national
question. “Here, too, we must reckon with the psychology of the people,
formed by its thousand years history”.... “Therefore, we deem it
necessary to go to the masses, not with the slogan of independence for
nationalities [and not their self-determination—adds the author
elsewhere], but with the demand that arises in actual life, namely, the demand
for their autonomy.” In short, Mr. Peshekhonov bluntly puts the question:
“Can we win complete freedom?” And he bluntly answers: “No.”


Next he puts the question: “Can we take the whole of the land?” And he
also answers: “No.” Caution, caution, caution, gentlemen! The
peasant deputies in the Duma said to Mr. Peshekhonov: “We were sent here
to get land, not to give it up.” At present the peasants want neither the
socialisation (equal division) nor the nationalisation of the
land. They are afraid of
both. They only want additional land. “It would therefore be more
expedient not to push the ’land’ line to its logical conclusion in the
platform” (p. 206). “I think it is even dangerous at the present
time to raise the question of general equalisation”
(p. 205). “Allotment land and privately-owned land not exceeding the
labour norm must be left in the possession of the present owners” in
conformity with the Land Bill introduced by the 104, and the transfer of the
whole land to the nation must be postponed—also, evidently, as a
“remote prospect”.


Caution, moderation and scrupulousness must be exercised in choosing the means
of struggle as well as the method of organisation. An armed uprising? “I
[Peshekhonov] tirelessly pray: May this bitter cup pass us by!... It would be
only too deplorable if anyone were to regard an uprising not as an unfortunate
possibility, but as a fatal necessity....

    

It is dangerous ... to make use of it carelessly ... the whole movement might
      come to grief” (No. 7, Pp. 177-78). The main task of the moment is
      to organise “the forces of the people”. “I scarcely
      believe that this task can be carried out at all satisfactorily by our two
      existing socialist parties. It is time to realise that a secret
      organisation cannot embrace the masses. The Cadet Party has also declared
      itself bankrupt in this matter. Evidently, this must be undertaken by
      someone else, and for this purpose, I believe, we need a legal socialist
      party.” (No. 7, pp. 179-80.)


As the reader will see, it cannot be denied that Mr. Peshekhonov’s views are
consistent, harmonious and rounded off. This champion of the monarchy, this
political trickster, who justifies the knout on the grounds that it has a
thousand years of history behind it, has not left much of the official programme
of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. And if the “real”

       S.-R.’s[3]

could all through the Duma period cleverly conceal such differences of
opinion, if in order to conceal them they could even collaborate on the same
newspapers, it only proves how far political hypocrisy can go.


What is the socio-economic class basis of S.-R. opportunism? The fact that
Peshekhonov & Co. are trying to adapt themselves to the interests of the
thrifty muzhik, are adulterating socialism to suit his interests.


Take the main question, the land. Mr. Peshekhonov twice repeats with relish the
words of the peasant-Trudoviks which pleased him so immensely: “We were
sent here to get land, not to give it up.” Indeed, those words are very
significant. But they utterly refute the petty-bourgeois illusions of Narodism,
and confirm all the propositions of the Marxists. These words clearly prove
that the proprietary instincts of the average muzhik are already
awakening. And only those who are absolutely ignorant of political economy
and West-European history can be unaware of the fact that the more political
liberty and democracy extends, the stronger these instincts grow and develop.


What conclusion should a person to whom socialism is not just an empty phrase
have drawn from the words of this shrewd, thrifty muzhik, chosen by the
“masses”? Obviously,

    

the conclusion that such a class of small proprietors cannot be the
vehicle for socialism; that socialists can and must support the small proprietor
class in its struggle against the landlords solely because this
struggle has a bourgeois- democratic significance and can have
bourgeois-democratic results; that it is the duty of a socialist not to
obscure but to expose the antagonism of interests between the working
masses as a whole and these small proprietors, who want to strengthen and
consolidate their own economic position, and who will be hostile to any
idea of “giving up” the land or anything else to the mass of the
propertyless and destitute. “We want to get land, not give it up!” Can
anything better express petty-bourgeois proprietary instincts and aspirations?


From this a Social-Democrat draws the following conclusion: we must support
these small proprietors in their struggle against the landlords and the
autocracy because of the revolutionary bourgeois-democratic character of this
struggle. If they win, the conditions of the whole people will be improved, but
this will be an improvement and development of the capitalist
system. Therefore, we must not pander to the proprietary or owning
instincts of this class, but, on the contrary, at once begin to combat
these instincts and explain their significance to the proletariat, warning the
proletariat and organising it in an independent party. Our agrarian programme
is:

to help the small proprietors to cast off the serf-owners by revolutionary
means; to point out to them the conditions for achieving nationalisation of the
land as the best agrarian system that is possible under capitalism, and to lay
bare the great difference between the interests of the proletarian and those of
the small proprietor.


The small shopkeeper’s socialism involves a different conclusion: we must
“reckon” with the psychology of the “masses” (the masses
of small proprietors, not the propertyless masses); we must bow servilely to
the proprietor’s desire to “get” something from the landlord, but
not to “give up” anything to the proletarian; to please the small
proprietor we must relegate socialism to the dim “remote future”;
we must recognise the desire of the petty proprietor to
consolidate his own economic position—in short, we must

    

describe as “socialism” subservience to the narrow egotism of the
      small proprietors and truckling to their prejudices.


Monarchist sentiments are a prejudice. Perhaps you think that it is the duty of
socialists to combat prejudices? You are mistaken; ’toilers’ socialism”
must adapt itself to prejudices.


Perhaps you think that the antiquity and “stability” (??) of the
monarchist prejudice call for a specially ruthless struggle against it? You are
mistaken. “Toilers’ socialism” deduces from the antiquity of the
knout merely that it must be treated with “extreme caution”.


True, Mr. Peshekhonov, in fighting—or pretending to fight—the
Cadets, repeats all the Cadet arguments in favour of the monarchy. Well, what
harm is there in that? Do you still not know that a bourgeois radical fights a
bourgeois liberal only for the purpose of taking his place and not for
the purpose of replacing his programme by a substantially different programme?
Have you forgotten the history of the French type of Trudovik socialists, that
is, the radical socialists, who “fought” the French Cadets, only to
act in exactly the same way as the latter when they themselves became Cabinet
Ministers? Do you not see that there is no more difference between
Mr. Peshekhonov and Mr. Struve than there is between Bobchinsky and
Dobchinsky?[11]


Mr. Peshekhonov guesses, perhaps, that there is some
material connection between the desire “to get land, not to
give it up”, and the monarchy. In order “not to give
it up” you must protect it. And the monarchy is nothing but the
hired police protection of those who do not want “to give up”
against those who are capable of

       taking.[4]

The Cadets need a monarchy to
protect the big bourgeoisie. The “Trudovik socialists” need a
monarchy to protect the thrifty muzhiks.


It is obvious that this outlook of the “Trudovik socialists”
inevitably leads to a pedantic and trite attitude to an up rising (“an
unfortunate possibility”; compare this with Mr.

    

Struve’s articles in Osvobozhdeniye, in the summer of 1905 about the
“mad and criminal advocacy of an uprising”). Hence, the lofty contempt for
“secret organisations” and the yearnings, in August 1906,
for a “legal socialist party”. To the objective historical
conditions which make an up rising inevitable, which compel the
ignorant masses, in spite of all their prejudices, to wage a struggle precisely
against the monarchy in defence of their own vital interests, and which convert
all Manilov yearnings for “a legal socialist party” into grist for
the mill of Ushakov[12]

& Co.— to these objective
conditions Peshekhonov & Co. do not give a thought. The admirers of Lavrov
and Mikhailovsky are obliged to reckon with the psychology of the downtrodden
masses and not with the objective ·conditions which are
transforming the psychology of the militant masses.



To sum up. We know now what it means to be a Toilers’ Popular
Socialist.

“Toilers"’ 

means pandering to the interests of small
proprietors who want “to get, but not to give
up”. “Popular” means pandering to the monarchist prejudices of
the people, to the chauvinistic fear lest certain nationalities should secede
from Russia. “Socialist” means declaring socialism to be a remote
prospect and replacing what political tricksters consider a narrow, doctrinaire
and irksome programme by a wide, free, flexible, mobile, light, thinly-clad and
even stark-naked “platform”. Long live the “Toilers’ Popular
Socialists”!


Mr. Peshekhonov & Co. are the first swallows of incipient social reaction
among the Russian peasantry. The good god has sent the Peshekhonovs down from
heaven as living proof of the Marxist proposition regarding the dual nature of
every small producer. A peasant is endowed both with reason and with prejudice;
he possesses the revolutionary qualities of a person who is exploited, and the
reactionary aspirations of the small proprietor anxious “to get, but not
to give up”. Mr. Peshekhonov & Co. are the ideological expression of
the reactionary aspects of the small peasant proprietor. Mr. Peshekhonov &
Co. are contemplators of the “rear” aspect of the Russian
muzhik. They are doing in

    

    the realm of ideas hit the Gurkos and Stishinskys are doing in a
    coarse, material way, bribing the peasant bourgeois with the sale
    of crown and state lands.


Whether such palliatives will perceptibly weaken the inevitable impact
between the masses and their exploiters in a sharp struggle is
still a big question. It is still a big question whether the
traditional peasant prejudices, fostered by all sorts of opportunists, will be
sufficient to out weigh the good sense of the poor peasantry that is being
awakened in the flames of revolution. In any case, the Social-Democrats will
perform their duty of developing and refining the revolutionary
consciousness of the peasantry.



Let Mr. Pesheknonov & Co. serve as a warning to the Right-wing
Social-Democrats. When criticising the Toilers’ Popular Socialists we might,
sometimes, have said to certain Menshevik Social-Democrats:

mutato nomine de fabula narratur (the fable is about you, only the name
is changed).

We, too, hive in our ranks people who yearn for a legal party, who are ready to
substitute a platform for a programme, to sink to the level of the masses. We
have Plekhanov, who delivered his famous verdict on the December rising:

“They should not have taken to arms.” We have Malishevsky, a contributor
to the Otkliki Sovremennosti,[13]

who attempted (although not in
Otkliki Sovremennosti) to delete the republic from our programme. It
would be very useful for these people to take a good look at the Peshekhonovs
in all their “pristine beauty”.

Another instrument for the police protection of proprietors is called
the standing army. Peshekhonov writes: “The democratic republic

standing army” (No. 8, p. 197). Please, gentlemen, admirers of Lavrov and
Mikhailovsky, will you candidly explain what this magnificent

[5]

Narodism (from the word
narod—people)—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian
revolutionary movement, which arose in the sixties and seventies of the
nineteenth century. The Narodniks stood for the abolition of the autocracy and
the transfer of the landlords’ lands to the peasantry. At the same time, they
denied that capitalist relations and a proletariat were bound to develop in
Russia, and they therefore considered the peasantry to be the main revolutionary
force. They regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism. With the
object of rousing the peasantry to struggle against the autocracy, the Narodniks
went to the countryside (“among the people”). The Narodniks started out
from an erroneous view of the role of the class struggle in historical
development, considering that history is made by heroes who ,are followed
passively by the mass of the people. In their struggle against tsarism the
Narodniks used the tactics of individual terrorism.



In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks began to reconcile themselves to
tsarism; they expressed the interests of the kulaks and carried on a
      relentless struggle against Marxism.





[6]

Economism—an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy
at the turn of the century, a Russian variety of international opportunism; its
organs were the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought),
1897-1902, and the magazine Rabocheye Dyelo (The Workers’ Cause),
1899-1902. The programme of the Economists whom Lenin called Russian
Bernsteinians, was embodied in the so-called Credo, written in 1899 by
Y. D. Kuskova.


The Economists restricted the tasks of the working class to the economic
struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, etc., asserting that the
political struggle was the business of the liberal bourgeoisie. They denied the
leading role of the workers’ party, which, they considered, should merely
observe the spontaneous development of the movement and register events. In
their glorifying of “spontaneity” they belittled the importance of
revolutionary theory and class-consciousness, declaring that a socialist
ideology could arise from the spontaneous workers’ movement. By denying the
need to imbue the workers’ movement with socialist consciousness through the
Marxist Party they cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. They defended
isolation and amateurishness in the Social-Democratic movement and opposed the
creation of a centralised working-class party. Economism threatened to divert
the working class from the revolutionary class path and turn it into a
political appendage of the bourgeoisie.


Lenin made an extensive criticism of the views of the Economists in his works:
“A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” (which was directed against
the Credo and was written during his exile in Siberia in 1899, where it
was adopted and signed by seventeen exiled Marxists), “A Retrograde Trend
in Russian Social-Democracy”, “Apropos of the profession de
foi”, “A Talk with Defenders of Economism” (see present
edition, Vol. 4, pp. 167-82,
255-85, 286-96, Vol. 5, pp. 313-20). Lenin achieved the ideological rout of
Economism in his book What Is To Be Done? (see present edition, Vol. 5,
pp. 347-529). A major part in the fight against Economism was played by Lenin’s
Iskra.

right to hold land to be given only to those who actually till it. Compensation
was envisaged for alienation of privately-owned land. The implementation of the

Guchkov’s letter to Trubetskoi[1]

long engaged, and to some extent is still engaging, the attention of
our political press, if such a term may be applied to the reptile
press,[2]

and to the few surviving liberal newspapers. This letter really
has a certain significance. It marks a big stride in the development
of the counter-revolutionary trend among wide sections of the Russian
big bourgeoisie. For these sections, the political strike in October
was already a decisive turning-point. After October 17 the big
bourgeois at once cried:

“Enough!” Therefore, a singular and very characteristic feature of the
Russian revolution is the fact that the date of the Constitutional Manifesto was
used as the name of their party by the elements of the big bourgeoisie who took
the side of the tsarist government, which began to adapt the new constitution to
the autocratic regime. October is the date of the only partial victory the
revolution in Russia has gained so far. Octobrists is the name adopted by the
counter-revolutionary party of the big bourgeoisie.


This contradiction clearly reveals the class antagonisms in the Russian
revolution. The explanation of it is provided by the Marxist view of the present
revolution in Russia. It is a bourgeois revolution. At all events, it is
clearing the ground for a wider and more rapid development of

capital ism. 

To
regard a full triumph of the revolutionary peasantry in its struggle for land as
a victory for the “labour principle”, as a transition to
“socialisation”, is a sheer petty-bourgeois illusion. But the
inevitable clearing of the ground for capitalism may proceed along two main
lines. Feudal Russia can be transformed into bourgeois Russia if conditions are
created that provide the mass of the peasantry and proletariat

    

 with the maximum welfare conceivable under capitalism. This
      transformation is also possible if conditions are created which mainly
      ensure the interests of the propertied classes, the landlords and
      capitalists. So far our revolution is following the second line. If it
      fails to gain another big victory there can be no doubt that the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeois Octobrists will be the legal executors of
      the Russian revolution, just as the Junker Bismarck became the legal
      executor of the half-hearted German Revolution of 1848.


Mr. Guchkov is no simpleton. He is already anticipating the pleasure of taking
the reins of government in his hands after the final defeat of the revolution,
and of combining business-like, geschäftmacher, bourgeois
“liberalism” with ruthless military and police measures of
repression against the discontented “lower classes”. Like a
practical, non-idealistic, bourgeois businessman, Mr. Guchkov has grasped the
actual political situation better than many philosophers and phrase-mongers
among our bourgeois intelligentsia

(l’ignorance est moins eloignée de la verité que le
préjugé!—ignorance is less removed from truth than
prejudice).

Mr. Guchkov brings the bourgeois ideals of the Cadets down to
earth. Especially notable in this connection is the following passage in his
letter which has not been appreciated by our slavish press:


“There is no doubt now,” writes Guchkov to Trubetskoi, “that the
triumph of the revolution, or even a new intensification of the revolutionary
crisis, will put an end to our young political liberty and the remnants of our
civilisation and prosperity.”


This is a remarkably correct and remarkably apt estimation of the present
political situation from the point of view of the interests of the capitalist
and landlord. Mr. Guchkov takes the bull by the horns. The issue in the present
political situation is indeed whether we are in for a new intensification of
the revolutionary crisis. We thank you for your candour, Mr. Guchkov! We
quite realise that the bourgeois professors and diplomats on Rech
dislike your determination, straightforwardness, quickness and aggressiveness,
your—pardon the vulgar expression—capacity for “dropping
bricks”, but we socialists are delighted by it. It just suits us.

 

Thus, anyone who wishes to be serious about the present political situation must
first take a clear stand on the question of a new intensification of the
revolutionary crisis. That is exactly what Mr. Guchkov is doing. His whole
letter says: “I am against it.” I subordinate everything to the task of
combating this intensification, to the task of suppressing everything that is
conducive to it. The reason is clear. A new intensification of the revolutionary
crisis contains the threat of the triumph of the revolution, which, in
turn, will threat en the “remnants” ... of the landed estates of
Messrs. Guchkov, Romanov, Stolypin and the rest of the gang of pogrom-mongers,
the “remnants” of bourgeois privileges which can serve as a
protection against the further struggles of the proletariat, in short, the
“remnants of our [Guchkov’s, Romanov’s, Stolypin’s]
prosperity”.


Mr. Guchkov argues correctly, far more correctly and consistently than the
Cadets who are now howling against him, who, through their spokesmen, the
Vinogradovs, Struves, Izgoyevs, Berdayevs and Milyukovs, have hundreds of times
bewailed the impending end of “liberty and civilisation” and the
triumph of “spontaneous insanity”.


Nor would it harm revolutionaries to take a lesson from the reactionaries in the
logical presentation of the question of the present political situation,
that is to say, of “a new intensification of the revolutionary
crisis”. Such an intensification will inevitably imply mass action on a
still wider scale than before, enriched with the experience of the great year of
the great Russian revolution. And the experience of that year, from the October
strike through the December insurrection, the peaceful Duma and its dissolution,
leads to an aggressive, all-Russian, armed uprising, with strikes as an
auxiliary and subsidiary means of struggle.


The government has shaped its entire policy to meet this universally expected,
new intensification of the revolutionary crisis. There is no doubt that it has
deliberately refrained from fixing the date for the new Duma elections in order
to have its hands free, in order, if the popular struggle becomes very acute, to
try to split it up by suddenly appointing the elections. Nor is there any doubt
that this is the angle from which it is carefully studying the question whether
to summon a new Duma and whether the old electoral
    

law should remain in force. Social-Democrats have less right than
    anyone to treat this question lightly.


The government is in a dilemma: Should it try to summon the Duma again on the
basis of the existing electoral law, while increasing repression, exercising
pressure on the electors and organising Black-Hundred gangs, or should it amend
the electoral law before the Second Duma is convened, so as to ensure a
Duma “capable of working”, i.e., a Black-Hundred Duma? Reaction
among the landlord class, the victories of the Black-Hundred landlords in the
Zemstvo, the obvious growth of discontent among the people—all these
prompt the government to repeal the present electoral law at once, to limit
the franchise in the sense of reverting from the Witte Duma to the Bulygin Duma,
if not something worse, or simply to call together the elected representatives
of the Zemstvos in the Second Duma. Our reptile press is already dropping hints
about some such plans in “higher quarters”, i.e., the Court set,
and are preparing the ground by arguing that the autocracy has the
“right” to promulgate a new electoral law without consulting the
Duma.


Let us consider which of these “lines” of government policy is the
more probable. Constitutional “legality”, political caution and
loyalty favour preservation of the electoral law of December 11. As you see,
these are all “idealistic” considerations which the Romanovs and
Pobedonostsevs are accustomed to despise. Besides, it is ridiculous to think
that men covered from head to foot with blood and mud, fighting their last
desperate battle to maintain their slaveowners’ rights, would be influenced by
such considerations. It is ridiculous to think that the tsar and his gang would
have any qualms about “legality” when they had no qualms about
promulgating the Law of December 11, the Law of February 20,[3]

etc., and are not in the least disturbed by the present downright
mockery of the “law”. No, these arguments are too flimsy.


The opinion of Europe? The need of a loan? This need is very urgent. And
European capital will lend money only on the guarantee of
“order”. ’What kind of “order”, however, is immaterial
to capital—it would even prefer the order that prevails in the
graveyard. But a second Cadet Duma (or, which God forbid, a still more radical
one!) threatens further

    

financial disclosures, further “disorder”! No, precisely from the point of
view of obtaining a loan in Europe it would pay the government best to annul the
present electoral law so as to ensure the election of a Black-Hundred Duma which
will sanction any and all loans.


Of course, we must not forget that, actually, profound economic and political
causes make an agreement between the autocracy and the liberal-monarchist
bourgeoisie necessary. The failure of the first attempt to come to
terms through the medium of the First Duma is by no means proof, and can not be
a proof, that all such attempts will fail—and very many such attempts will
still be made. But an agreement through a Cadet Duma must not now be regarded
(and the autocracy cannot regard it) as being very likely.


Revolutionaries learn from the experience of revolution; but so does the
autocracy, and very attentively. Everyone can see that there is practically no
hope of a Duma more to the right under the present electoral law. The Second
Duma is to be summoned at the end of the winter, just when it is usual for
starvation, unemployment and want to become particularly acute among the
masses. The parties to the left of the Cadets will now undoubtedly be far less
disposed than formerly to be guided by the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie; they
will be far more capable of undertaking independent, decisive and energetic
political action. No! We must harbour no illusions, we must not imagine the
enemy to be altogether lacking in brains, perspicacity or discretion. We need
have no doubt that after the experience of the Cadet Duma the “heroes of
thought and action” in this Black-Hundred government are exerting
themselves to the utmost to prevent a repetition of it.


The government has seen that the dissolution of the Duma did not result in an
immediate widespread uprising of the whole people. The coup d’état which had
been prepared silently and secretly was very much to the liking of the
“higher quarters”. They have been immensely impressed by what seems
to them to have been a bold and successful attack on the revolution. They cannot
help contemplating now another attack of the same kind made beforehand,
to prevent a “new intensification of the revolutionary crisis”. The
tsar’s courtiers are military men. They fully appreciate the advan

    

 of taking the offensive, of taking the initiative in military
      operations. Fear an uprising? But it is inevitable, one way or
      another—workers’ strikes, mutiny in the armed forces and peasant
      revolts have been proving this for a whole year. A second Cadet
    Duma would create a situation for an uprising still more favourable for the
    people: the final bankruptcy of the policy of “military-court
    liberalism”, the fact that the people are sick and tired of the
    repressions, etc., etc. If a “new intensification of the revolutionary
    crisis” is inevitable, then we must attack first—that
    is what Ignatyev is thinking, what he must be thinking. And he will
    attack—on the eve of the elections the tsar will annul the electoral
    law of December II and promulgate a new law which will guarantee a
    Duma of Black-Hundred elements.


We do not claim to be prophets able to foresee all the possible outcomes of the
present highly complicated political situation. Social-Democrats, however, must
carefully weigh up the trends of all the forces that are operating in politics
in order wisely to decide their own tactics. If they do that they will arrive at
the following inexorable conclusion: Workers! Be prepared for the promulgation
by the government of a Black-Hundred electoral law by the time of the elections!
Peasants! Beware, the government is planning to change the electoral system so
that peasant deputies, Trudoviks, cannot be elected to the Duma!


We must not let the government catch us unawares. We must conduct the most
vigorous agitation among the masses to explain the danger that is
threatening—we must shatter their

naive 

faith in the permanence of the
electoral law as a “constitutional” institution—we must
destroy constitutional illusions—we must recall the examples of the
European revolutions with their frequent alterations of the electoral
laws—we must spare no effort to spread the conviction that the crisis now
maturing is not a parliamentary or constitutional crisis, but a revolutionary
crisis, which force alone will decide, and which only a victorious armed
uprising will resolve.

[1]

This refers to A. I. Guchkov’s letter, “Reply to
Count Y. N. Trubetskoi”, published in the newspaper Russkiye
Vedomosti, No. 224, on September 10(23), 1906.


On August 24 (September 6), 1906, the tsarist government published a statement
on the establishment of military courts and openly proclaimed its programme to
be the abolition of all concessions won through the revolutionary upsurge in
October-December 1905. In an interview in Novoye Vremya, the leader
of the Octobrists, Guchkov, approved both the establishment of military courts
and the entire counter-revolutionary programme of the government. Guchkov’s
unreserved agreement with the government’s policy caused dissatisfaction among
some representatives of the bourgeoisie. In particular, Count Trubetskoi, one of
the organisers of the Party of “Peaceful Renovation” wrote a letter
to Guchkov asking him whether he belonged to the party of
“peaceful” or “military” renovation. Guchkov’s letter in
reply, to which Lenin refers, fully confirmed his agreement with the
government’s policy and approved the dissolution of the First State Duma.





[2]

“Reptiles” was the name given to the
venal press organs in the pay of the tsarist government and grovelling
    before it.





[3]

On February 20 (March 5), 1906 a law and two ukases to the Senate on the State
Duma and Council of State were published. By this law the tsarist government
virtually annulled its Manifesto of October 17.


According to the new law the Council of State; half of which was appointed by
the supreme power and the other half elected from Black-Hundred sections of the
nobility, big capitalists and clergy, was converted from a consultative into a
legislative body. The Council of State could veto any decision of the Duma.

The question of guerrilla action is one that greatly interests our Party and the
mass of the workers. We have dealt with this question in passing several times,
and now we propose to give the more complete statement of our views we have
promised.

I 

Let us begin from the beginning. What are the fundamental demands which every
Marxist should make of an examination of the question of forms of struggle? In
the first place, Marxism differs from all primitive forms of socialism by not
binding the movement to any one particular form of struggle. It recognises the
most varied forms of struggle; and it does not “concoct” them, but
only generalises, organises, gives conscious expression to those forms of
struggle of the revolutionary classes which arise of themselves in the course of
the movement. Absolutely hostile to all abstract formulas and to all doctrinaire
recipes, Marxism demands an attentive attitude to the mass struggle in
progress, which, as the movement develops, as the class-consciousness of the
masses grows, as economic and political crises become acute, continually gives
rise to new and more varied methods of defence and attack. Marxism, therefore,
positively does not reject any form of struggle. Under no circumstances does
Marxism confine itself to the forms of struggle possible and in existence at the
given moment only, recognising as it does that new forms of struggle, unknown to
the participants of the given period, inevitably arise as the given
social situation, changes. In this respect Marxism learns, if we may

    

    so express it, from mass practice, and makes no claim what ever to
    teach the masses forms of struggle invented by
    “systematisers” in the seclusion of their studies. We
    know—said Kautsky, for instance, when examining the forms of
    social revolution—that the coming crisis will introduce new
    forms of struggle that we are now unable to foresee.


In the second place, Marxism demands an absolutely historical
examination of the question of the forms of struggle. To treat this question
apart from the concrete historical situation betrays a failure to understand the
rudiments of dialectical materialism. At different stages of economic
evolution, depending on differences in political, national-cultural, living and
other conditions, different forms of struggle come to the fore and become the
principal forms of struggle; and in connection with this, the secondary,
auxiliary forms of struggle undergo change in their ·turn. To attempt to
answer yes or no to the question whether any particular means of struggle should
be used, without making a detailed examination of the concrete situation of the
given movement at the given stage of its development, means completely to
abandon the Marxist position.


These are the two principal theoretical propositions by which we must be
guided. The history of Marxism in Western Europe provides an infinite number of
examples corroborating what has been said. European Social-Democracy at the
present time regards parliamentarism and the trade union movement as the
principal forms of struggle; it recognised insurrection in the past, and is
quite prepared to recognise it, should conditions change, in the
future—despite the opinion of bourgeois liberals like the Russian Cadets
and the Bezzaglavtsi.[1]

Social-Democracy in the seventies
rejected the general strike as a social panacea, as a means of overthrowing the
bourgeoisie at one stroke by non-political means—but Social-Democracy
fully recognises the mass political strike (especially after the experience of
Russia in 1905) as one of the methods of struggle essential under
certain conditions. Social-Democracy recognised street barricade
fighting in the forties, rejected it for definite reasons at the end of the
nineteenth century, and expressed complete readiness to revise the latter view
and to admit the expediency

    

of barricade fighting after the experience of Moscow, which, in the words
of K. Kautsky, initiated new tactics of barricade fighting.

Bezzaglavtsi—a semi-Cadet, semi-Menshevik
group of the Russian bourgeois intelligentsia (S. N. Prokopovich,
Y. D. Kuskova,
V. Y. Bogucharsky, V. V. Portugalov, V. V. Khizhnyakov, and others), formed in
the period of the incipient decline of the 1905-07 revolution. The group derived
its name from the political weekly magazine Bez Zaglavia (Without a
Title) published in St. Petersburg in January-May 1906 under the
editorship of Prokopovich; later the Bezzaglavtsi were grouped around
the Left-Cadet news paper Tovarishch
(Comrade). Under cover of their
formal non-partisanship, the Bezzaglavtsi propagated the ideas of
bourgeois liberalism and opportunism and supported the revisionists of Russian
and international Social-Democracy.

Having established the general Marxist propositions, let us turn to the Russian
revolution. Let us recall the historical development of the forms of struggle it
produced. First there were the economic strikes of workers (1896-1900), then the
political demonstrations of workers and students (1901-02), peasant revolts
(1902), the beginning of mass political strikes variously combined with
demonstrations (Rostov 1902, the strikes in the summer of 1903, January 9,
1905), the all-Russian political strike accompanied by local cases of barricade
fighting (October 1905), mass barricade fighting and armed uprising (1905,
December), the peaceful parliamentary struggle (April-June 1906), partial
military revolts (June 1905-July 1906) and partial peasant revolts (autumn
1905-autumn 1906).


Such is the state of affairs in the autumn of 1906 as concerns forms of
struggle in general. The “retaliatory” form of struggle adopted by
the autocracy is the Black-Hundred pogrom, from Kishinev in the spring of 1903
to Sedlets in the autumn of 1906. All through this period the organisation of
Black-Hundred pogroms and the beating up of Jews, students, revolutionaries and
class-conscious workers continued to progress and perfect itself, combining the
violence of Black-Hundred troops with the violence of hired ruffians, going as
far as the use of artillery in villages and towns and merging with punitive
expeditions, punitive trains and so forth.


Such is the principal background of the picture. Against this background there
stands out—unquestionably as something partial, secondary and auxiliary
—the phenomenon to the study and assessment of which the present article
is devoted. What is this phenomenon? What are its forms? What are its causes?
When did it arise and how far has it spread? What is its significance in the
general course of the revolution? What is its relation to the struggle of the
working class organised and led by Social-Democracy? Such

    

are the questions which we must now proceed to examine after having sketched the
      general background of the picture.


The phenomenon in which we are interested is the armed struggle. It is
conducted by individuals and by small groups. Same belong to revolutionary
organisations, while others (the majority in certain parts of Russia)
do not belong to any revolutionary organisation. Armed struggle pursues two
different aims, which must be strictly distinguished: in the
first place, this struggle aims at assassinating individuals, chiefs and
subordinates in the army and police; in the second place, it aims at the
confiscation of monetary funds both from the government and from private
persons. The confiscated funds go partly into the treasury of the Party, partly
for the special purpose of arming and preparing for an uprising, and partly for
the maintenance of persons en gaged in the struggle we are describing. The big
expropriations (such as the Caucasian, involving over 200,000 rubles, and the
Moscow, involving 575,000 rubles) went in fact first and foremost to
revolutionary parties—small expropriations go mostly, and sometimes
entirely, to the maintenance of the “expropriators”. This form of
struggle undoubtedly be came widely developed and extensive only in 1900, i.e.,
after the December uprising. The intensification of the political crisis to the
point of an armed struggle and, in particular, the intensification of poverty,
hunger and unemployment in town and country, was one of the important causes of
the struggle we are describing. This form of struggle was adopted as the
preferable and even exclusive form of social struggle by the vagabond
elements of the population, the lumpen proletariat and anarchist
groups. Declaration of martial law, mobilisation of fresh troops, Black-Hundred
pogroms (Sedlets), and military courts must be regarded as the
“retaliatory” form of struggle adopted by the autocracy.

V. I.  

      Lenin
Guerrilla Warfare



    

III

The usual appraisal of the struggle we are describing is that it is anarchism,
Blanquism, the old terrorism, the acts of individuals isolated from the masses,
which demoralise the workers, repel wide strata of the population, disorganise

    

the movement and injure the revolution. Examples in support of this
appraisal can easily be found in the events reported every day in the
newspapers.


But are such examples convincing? In order to test this, let us take a locality
where the form of struggle we are examining is most developed—the
Lettish Territory. This is the way Novoye Vremya (in its issues of
September 9 and 12) complains of the activities of the Lettish
Social-Democrats. The Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party (a section of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) regularly issues its paper in 30,000
copies. The announcement columns publish lists of spies whom it is the duty of
every decent person to exterminate. People who assist the police are proclaimed
“enemies of the revolution”, liable to execution and, moreover, to
confiscation of property. The public is instructed to give money to the
Social-Democratic Party only against signed and stamped receipt. In the Party’s
latest report, showing a total income of 48,000 rubles for the year, there
figures a sum of 5,600 rubles contributed by the Libau branch for arms which was
obtained by expropriation. Naturally, Novoye Vremya rages and fumes
against this “revolutionary law”, against this “terror
government”.


Nobody will be so bold as to call these activities of the Lettish
Social-Democrats anarchism, Blanquism or terrorism. But why? Because here we
have a clear connection between the new form of struggle and the
uprising which broke out in December and which is again brewing. This connection
is not so perceptible in the case of Russia as a whole, but it exists. The fact
that “guerrilla” warfare became wide spread precisely after
December, and its connection with the accentuation not only of the economic
crisis but also of the political crisis is beyond dispute. The old Russian
terrorism was an affair of the intellectual conspirator; today as a general rule
guerrilla warfare is waged by the worker combatant, or simply by the unemployed
worker. Blanquism and anarchism easily occur to the minds of people who have a
weakness for stereotype; but under the circumstances of an uprising, which are
so apparent in the Lettish Territory, the inappropriateness of such trite labels
is only too obvious.


The example of the Letts clearly demonstrates how incorrect, unscientific and
unhistorical is the practice so very

    

      common among us of analysing guerrilla warfare without reference to the
      circumstances of an uprising. These circumstances must be borne in mind,
      we must reflect on the peculiar features of an intermediate period
      between big acts of insurrection, we must realise what forms of struggle
      inevitably arise under such circumstances, and not try to shirk the issue
      by a collection of words learned by rote, such as are used equally by the
      Cadets and the Novoye Vremya-ites:

      anarchism, robbery, hooliganism!


It is said that guerrilla acts disorganise our work. Let us apply this argument
to the situation that has existed since December 1905, to the period of
Black-Hundred pogroms and martial law. What disorganises the movement more in
such a period: the absence of resistance or organised guerrilla
warfare? Compare the centre of Russia with her western borders, with Poland and
the Lettish Territory. It is unquestionable that guerrilla warfare is far more
widespread and far more developed in the western border regions. And it is
equally unquestionable that the revolutionary movement in general, and the
Social-Democratic movement in particular, are more disorganised in
central Russia than in the western border regions. Of course, it would not enter
our heads to conclude from this that the Polish and Lettish Social-Democratic
movements are less disorganised thanks to guerrilla warfare. No. The
only conclusion that can be drawn is that guerrilla warfare is not to blame for
the state of disorganisation of the Social-Democratic working-class movement
in Russia in 1906.


Allusion is often made in this respect to the peculiarities of national
conditions. But this allusion very clearly betrays the weakness of the current
argument. If it is a matter of national conditions then it is not a matter of
anarchism, Blanquism or terrorism—sins that are common to Russia as a
whole and even to the Russians especially—but of something else. Analyse
this something else concretely, gentle men! You will then find that
national oppression or antagonism explain nothing, because they have always
existed in the western border regions, whereas guerrilla warfare has been
engendered only by the present historical period. There are many places where
there is national oppression and antagonism, but no guerrilla struggle, which
sometimes develops

    

where there is no national oppression whatever. A concrete analysis of the
question will show that it is not a matter of national oppression, but of
conditions of insurrection. Guerrilla warfare is an inevitable form of struggle
at a time when the mass movement has actually reached the point of an uprising
and when fairly large intervals occur between the “big engagements”
in the civil war.


It is not guerrilla actions which disorganise the movement, but the weakness of
a party which is incapable of taking such actions under its control.
That is why the anathemas which we Russians usually hurl against guerrilla
actions go hand in hand with secret, casual, unorganised guerrilla actions which
really do disorganise the Party. Being in capable of understanding what
historical conditions give rise to this struggle, we are incapable of
neutralising its deleterious aspects. Yet the struggle is going on. It is
engendered by powerful economic and political causes. It is not in our power to
eliminate these causes or to eliminate this struggle. Our complaints against
guerrilla warfare are complaints against our Party weakness in the matter of an
uprising.


What we have said about disorganisation also applies to demoralisation. It is
not guerrilla warfare which demoralises, but unorganised, irregular,
non-party guerrilla acts. We shall not rid ourselves one least bit of this
most unquestionable demoralisation by condemning and cursing guerrilla
actions, for condemnation and curses are absolutely incapable of putting a stop
to a phenomenon which has been engendered by profound economic and political
causes. It may be objected that if we are incapable of putting a stop to an
abnormal and demoralising phenomenon, this is no reason why the Party
should adopt abnormal and demoralising methods of struggle. But such an
objection would be a purely bourgeois-liberal and not a Marxist objection,
because a Marxist cannot regard civil war, or guerrilla warfare, which is one of
its forms, as abnormal and demoralising in general. A Marxist bases
himself on the class struggle, and not social peace. In certain periods of acute
economic and political crises the class struggle ripens into a direct civil
war, i.e., into an armed struggle between two sections of the people. In such
periods a Marxist is obliged to take the stand of

    

      civil war. Any moral condemnation of civil war would be
      absolutely impermissible from the standpoint of Marxism.


In a period of civil war the ideal party of the proletariat is a fighting
party. This is absolutely incontrovertible. We are quite prepared to grant
that it is possible to argue and prove the inexpediency from the
standpoint of civil war of particular forms of civil war at any particular
moment. We fully admit criticism of diverse forms of civil war from the
standpoint of military expediency and absolutely agree that in
this question it is the Social-Democratic practical workers in each
particular locality who must have the final say. But we absolutely demand in the
name of the principles of Marxism that an analysis of the conditions of civil
war should not be evaded by hackneyed and stereo typed talk about anarchism,
Blanquism and terrorism, and that senseless methods of guerrilla activity
adopted by some organisation or other of the Polish Socialist Party at some
moment or other should not be used as a bogey when discussing the question of
the participation of the Social-Democratic Party as such in guerrilla warfare in
general.


The argument that guerrilla warfare disorganises the movement must be regarded
critically. Every new form of struggle, accompanied as it is by new
dangers and new sacrifices, inevitably “disorganises” organisations
which are unprepared for this new form of struggle. Our old propagandist circles
were disorganised by recourse to methods of agitation. Our committees were
subsequently disorganised by recourse to demonstrations. Every military action
in any war to a certain extent disorganises the ranks of the fighters. But this
does not mean that one must not fight. It means that one must learn to
fight. That is all.


When I see Social-Democrats proudly and smugly declaring “we are not
anarchists, thieves, robbers, we are superior to all this, we reject guerrilla
warfare”,—I ask myself:

Do these people realise what they are saying? Armed clashes and conflicts
between the Black-Hundred government and the population are taking place all
over the country. This is an absolutely inevitable phenomenon at the present
stage of development of the revolution. The population is spontaneously

    

and in an unorganised way—and for that very reason often in
unfortunate and undesirable forms—reacting to this phenomenon
also by armed conflicts and attacks. I can under stand us refraining from Party
leadership of this spontaneous struggle in a particular place or at a
particular time because of the weakness and unpreparedness of our organisation.
I realise that this question must be settled by the local practical workers, and
that the remoulding of weak and unprepared organisations is no easy matter. But
when I see a Social-Democratic theoretician or publicist not displaying regret
over this unpreparedness, but rather a proud smugness and a self-exalted
tendency to repeat phrases learned by rote in early youth about anarchism,
Blanquism and terrorism, I am hurt by this degradation of the most revolutionary
doctrine in the world.


It is said that guerrilla warfare brings the class-conscious proletarians into
close association with degraded, drunken riff-raff. That is true. But it only
means that the party of the proletariat can never regard guerrilla warfare as
the only, or even as the chief, method of struggle; it means that this method
must be subordinated to other methods, that it must be commensurate with the
chief methods of warfare, and must be ennobled by the enlightening and
organising influence of socialism. And without this latter condition,
all, positively all, methods of struggle in bourgeois society bring the
proletariat into close association with the various non-proletarian strata above
and below it and, if left to the spontaneous course of events, become frayed,
corrupted and prostituted. Strikes, if left to the spontaneous course of events,
become corrupted into “alliances”—agreements between the workers
and the masters against the consumers. Parliament becomes corrupted
into a brothel, where a gang of bourgeois politicians barter wholesale and
retail “national freedom”, “liberalism”,
“democracy”, republicanism, anti-clericalism, socialism and all
other wares in demand. A newspaper becomes corrupted into a public pimp, into a
means of corrupting the masses, of pandering to the low instincts of the mob,
and so on and so forth. Social-Democracy knows of no universal methods of
struggle, such as would shut off the proletariat by a Chinese wall from the
strata standing slightly above or slightly below it. At different

    

periods Social-Democracy applies different methods, always qualifying
    the choice of them by strictly defined ideological and
    organisational

     conditions.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]

The Bolshevik Social-Democrats are often accused of a frivolous passion
for guerrilla actions. It would therefore not be amiss to recall that in
the draft resolution on guerrilla actions (Partiiniye Izvestia,
No. 2, and Lenin’s report on the Congress), the section of the
Bolsheviks who defend guerrilla actions suggested the following conditions
for their recognition: “expropriations” of private property were not to
he permitted under any circumstances; “expropriations” of government
property were not to he recommended hut only allowed, provided
that they were controlled by the Party and their proceeds used
for the needs of an uprising. Guerrilla acts in the form of
terrorism were to he recommended against brutal government
officials and active members of the Black Hundreds, hut on
condition that 1) the sentiments of the masses he taken into account; 2)
the conditions of the working-class movement in the given locality he
reckoned with, and 3) care be taken that the forces of the proletariat
should not be frittered away. The practical difference between this draft
and the resolution which was adopted at the Unity Congress lies
exclusively in the fact that “expropriations” of government
property are not allowed.—Lenin

The forms of struggle in the Russian revolution are distinguished by their
colossal variety compared with the bourgeois revolutions in Europe. Kautsky
partly foretold this in 1902 when he said that the future revolution (with the
exception perhaps of Russia, he added) might be not so much a struggle
of the people against the government as a struggle between two sections of the
people. In Russia we undoubtedly see a wider development of this latter
struggle than in the bourgeois revolutions in the West. The enemies of our
revolution among the people are few in number, but as the struggle grows more acute
they become more and more organised and receive the support of the reactionary
strata of the bourgeoisie. It is therefore absolutely natural and inevitable
that in such a period, a period of nation-wide political strikes, an
uprising cannot assume the old form of individual acts restricted to a
very short time and to a very small area. It is absolutely natural and
inevitable that the uprising should assume the higher and more complex form of
a

    

prolonged civil war embracing the whole country, i.e., an armed struggle between
two sections of the people. Such a war cannot be conceived otherwise than as a
series of a few big engagements at comparatively long intervals and a large
number of small encounters during these intervals. That being so—and it is
undoubtedly so—the Social-Democrats must absolutely make it their duty to
create organisations best adapted to lead the masses in these big engagements
and, as far as possible, in these small encounters as well. In a period when
the class struggle has become accentuated to the point of civil war,
Social-Democrats must make it their duty not only to participate but also to
play the leading role in this civil war. The Social-Democrats must
train and prepare their organisations to be really able to act as a
belligerent side which does not miss a single opportunity of inflicting
damage on the enemy’s forces.


This is a difficult task, there is no denying. It cannot be accomplished at
once. Just as the whole people are being retrained and are learning to fight in
the course of the civil war, so our organisations must be trained, must be
reconstructed in conformity with the lessons of experience to be equal to this task.


We have not the slightest intention of foisting on practical workers any
artificial form of struggle, or even of deciding from our armchair what part any
particular form of guerrilla warfare should play in the general course of the
civil war in Russia. We are far from the thought of regarding a concrete
assessment of particular guerrilla actions as indicative of a trend in
Social-Democracy. But we do regard it as our duty to help as far as possible to
arrive at a correct theoretical assessment of the new forms of struggle
engendered by practical life. We do regard it as our duty relentlessly to
combat stereotypes and prejudices which hamper the class-conscious workers in
correctly presenting a new and difficult problem and in correctly approaching
its solution.

      We consider this resolution sound in principle and note
      its agreement with the points we developed in our article
      “Guerrilla Warfare”. We would suggest only a few minor
      amendments and additions to the text of the resolution. In Point 3 of the
      preamble we would say: “the revolution not being strong enough at
      the present time”, etc. In the resolution proper we would
      add repudiation of “expropriations” in agreement with the
      decision of the Congress, and then a statement to the effect that
      guerrilla actions must conform to the temper of the broad masses and the
      conditions of the working-class movement. It is clear, however, that our
      Moscow comrades take this for granted.

This note was printed in the form of a comment
“from the editorial board” on the resolution of the Moscow Committee
of the R.S.D.L.P. on guerrilla warfare. The Moscow Committee adopted the
resolution in September 1906. Point 3 of the preamble of the resolution pointed
out that “the revolution, while not being powerful enough to smash the
regime by a simultaneous action of the people is, however, strong enough not to
remain passive and is spontaneously passing to guerrilla attacks against the
enemy, which are especially to be expected in the villages where
recruitment
is beginning”.

      As we know, the Unity Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party evaded the task of making a class analysis of the political parties
      in Russia and of defining the proletarian attitude to these parties. Its
      general endorsement of the Amsterdam Resolution was nothing more than a
      form of evasion. And yet the revolution more and more insistently demands
      that we apply the Marxist method and Marxist theory to throw light on the
      profound and highly interesting process of the formation of parties, which
      for obvious reasons is more rapid and intense in Russia than anywhere
      else.
    

      This process, of course, has not come to an end by a long, long way, and
      has not yet produced fully stable results. But such a process can
      never come to an end in capitalist society, and its results can
      become “stable” only if the revolution, as the drastic
      demolition of the whole of the old political superstructure, reaches a
      state of stagnation. Therefore we cannot under any circumstances postpone
      our analysis of the bourgeois parties, the more so, because the period of
      the October liberties, on the one hand, and the period of the First Duma,
      on the other, have undoubtedly already produced important results
      which must not be ignored. The open revolutionary struggle by means of
      strikes, uprisings, etc., and the new election campaign will demand from
      our Party a clear and precise definition of its attitude to the various
      parties, and this is possible only on the basis of a scientific, i.e., a
      class analysis.
    
 

Let us start with the enumeration of the more or less important political
      parties (or, perhaps,

    types[1]

of parties) in their order from “Right” to “Left”.

1) The Union of the Russian People, the monarchists, etc.;

2) the Party of Law and Order;

3) the Octobrists;

4) the Party of Peaceful Renovation;

5) the Party of Democratic Reforms;

6) the Cadets;

7) the free-thinkers, the radicals, the Bezzaglavtsi, etc.;

8) the Toilers’ Popular Socialists;

9) the Socialist-Revolutionaries;

10) the Maximalists;

11) the Social-Democrats—Mensheviks and Bolsheviks, We do not
    count the anarchists, for it would be too risky to call them (and,
    perhaps, the Maximalists) a
    political party.


In this motley series of parties, we can clearly distinguish five main
types:

1) the Black Hundreds;

2) the Octobrists;

3) the Cadets;

4) the Trudoviks, and

5) the Social-Democrats. The soundness of this classification is
proved by the analysis of the class nature of each particular party.


There can be no doubt about the need to single out the Social-Democratic Party
as a distinct type. It is a type common to the whole of Europe. In Russia it is
the only workers’ party, the party of the proletariat, both in
composition and in its strictly consistent proletarian point of view.


Further, it is equally obvious that the Trudoviks must also be singled
out as a distinct type. They include: the Toilers’ Popular Socialist Party, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries proper, and, lastly, the Maximalists. They all base
their theoretical standpoint on the “labour principle”. They all
strive to unite and merge the proletarians with the small producers in a single
“toilers’ group”. They strive mainly for the support of the
peasantry. The State Duma, where the majority of the peasant deputies formed a
separate “Trudovik Group”, proved in fact that the above-mentioned
trends have succeeded (more or less) in actually

    

laying the foundation of a political· organisation of the peasants.


True, the political parties of this type have a far less definite and finished
form than that of the Social-Democratic Party. Nominally, the Party of the
Maximalists does not exist, although their split from the
Socialist-Revolutionaries is an accomplished fact, certified by their
independent actions, both
literary and terrorist. In the State Duma, the Socialist-Revolutionaries did not
form their own group, but acted behind the backs of a section of the
Trudoviks. The Toilers’ Popular Socialist Party, likewise, is still only about
to be born, although its literary activity is already conducted not only in
alliance with the Socialist-Revolutionaries proper, but sometimes quite
independently of them. Its leaders in the Duma also acted partly in unison with
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and partly independently of them. The Minutes
of the First Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (Paris 1906)
also show the Toilers’ Popular Socialists as a distinct
“group”, which behaves independently of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party. In short, we find in this camp:

(1) a secret
party (the Socialist-Revolutionaries) quite incapable of creating anything like
a stable, mass organisation, and incapable of acting independently under its
own flag, whether in the State Duma or in the literature of the period of
liberties;

(2) a nascent legal party (the Toilers’ Popular Socialists)
which acted as a group at the Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party
(December 1905), but which hitherto has been unable even to begin the formation
of a mass organisation and which in its literature and in the State Duma acts
mostly in alliance with the Socialist-Revolutionaries.


The fact that after two periods of relative freedom (the “October”
and the “Duma” periods) the Trudoviks still remain a politically
amorphous body cannot, of course, be attributed to chance. Undoubtedly, this to
some extent is due to the fact that the petty bourgeoisie (especially in the
rural districts) is less capable of organising than the
proletariat. Undoubtedly, the ideological confusion of the Trudoviks also reflects
the extremely precarious position of the small producer in present-day society:
the extreme Right wing of the Trudoviks (the Toilers’ Popular Socialist Party,

    

led by Peshekhonov & Co.) differs very little from the Cadets, for it
      deletes from its programme both republicanism and the demand for all the
      land; the extreme Left of the Trudoviks, the Maximalists, differs very
      little from the anarchists.


These two extremes indicate the amplitude, so to speak, of the political
oscillations of the toiling petty bourgeoisie. That the petty bourgeoisie
should display such instability is quite explicable from the economic point
of view. Undoubtedly, the immediate future of the Russian revolution will
increase rather than diminish this instability. But, while noting and
explaining this instability, we must not lose sight of the enormous political
importance of the parties of the Trudovik type. Real political liberty will
strengthen these parties most of all, because in the absence of
political liberty their ability to organise is less than that of the
bourgeoisie, and also less than that of the proletariat. On the other hand, in a
predominantly petty-bourgeois and peasant country like Russia, the formation of
ideologically vacillating and politically unstable but exceedingly large
petty-bourgeois or “Trudovik” parties is inevitable.


In a country like Russia, the outcome of the bourgeois revolution depends most
of all on the political conduct of the small producers. That the big bourgeoisie
will be tray the revolution is beyond doubt (they have already betrayed it
two-thirds). After October and December, no further proof is required that, as
far as the Russian workers are concerned, the proletariat will be the most
reliable fighter. The petty bourgeoisie, however, is the variable quantity which
will determine the outcome. Social-Democrats must therefore watch very carefully
its present political oscillations between abject Cadet loyalty and bold,
ruthless, revolutionary struggle; and not only watch that process, of course, but as
far as possible bring proletarian influence to bear upon it.


To proceed. Undoubtedly, the Cadets must be singled out as a separate type. The
Party of Democratic Reforms to the right of them, and the free-thinkers,
radicals, etc., to the left, are not more than quite insignificant offshoots. In
the present political period the Cadets are an independent political type. What
distinguishes them from the Trudoviks

    

is clear. The typical Trudovik is a politically conscious peasant. He is
not averse to a compromise with the monarchy, to settling down quietly on his
own plot of land under the bourgeois system; but at the present time
his main efforts are concentrated on the fight against the land lords for land,
on the fight against the feudal State and for democracy. His ideal is to abolish
exploitation; but he conceives this abolition in a petty-bourgeois fashion, and
therefore, in fact, his strivings are converted into a struggle, not
against all exploitation, but only against the exploitation practised by the
landlords and the big financiers. The Cadet, however, is a typical bourgeois
intellectual and sometimes even a liberal landlord. To compromise with the
monarchy, to put a stop to the revolution is his main striving. Totally
incapable of fighting, the Cadet is a typical stockbroker. His ideal is to
perpetuate bourgeois exploitation in respectable, civilised, parliamentary
forms. His political strength lies in the amalgamation of an enormous mass of
bourgeois intellectuals, who are indispensable in every capitalist society, but,
of course, absolutely incapable of seriously influencing a real change of the
social system in this society.


The typical Octobrist is not a bourgeois intellectual, but a big bourgeois. He
is not the ideologist of bourgeois society, he is its real master. Being
directly interested in capitalist exploitation, he has a contempt for all
theories, despises the intelligentsia, and, unlike the Cadets, repudiates all
claims to “democracy”. He is a bourgeois businessman. Like the
Cadet, he is also striving for a deal with the monarchy, but his idea of such a
deal is not some particular political system, or parliamentarism, but an
agreement between a few persons, or chiefs, with the Court camarilla with a view
to directly subordinating the clumsy, dull-witted and Asiatically corrupt
Russian officials to the ruling bourgeoisie. An Octobrist is a Cadet who
applies his bourgeois theories in business. A Cadet is an Octobrist who, when
not busy robbing the workers and peasants, dreams of an ideal bourgeois
society. The Octobrist has still to learn something of parliamentary etiquette
and of political hypocrisy coupled with flirting with democracy. The Cadet has
still to learn something of the art of bourgeois business trickery—and

    

then they will undoubtedly and inevitably merge, quite irrespective of whether
      this fusion will be brought about at the present time and by the present
      “Peaceful Renovators”.


But let us not discuss the future. Our business is to learn to understand the
present. With full power remaining in the hands of the scoundrelly Court gang,
it is quite natural that the mere utterance of democratic phrases by the Cadets
and their “parliamentary” opposition were in fact of
greater service to the elements on their lift. It is also natural that the
Octobrist, who is directly hostile to these elements, angrily turned away from
the Cadets and supported (in the elections to the First Duma) the government
Black Hundreds.


The Black Hundreds are the last type of our political parties. Unlike Guchkov
& Co., they do not want the “Constitution of October 17th”, but
the preservation and formal restoration of the autocracy. It is in their
interests to perpetuate the filth, ignorance and corruption that flourish under
the sceptre of the adored monarch. They are united by the frantic struggle for
the privileges of the Court camarilla, for the opportunity, as of old, to rob,
oppress and muzzle the whole of Russia. Their determination to defend the
present tsar’s government at all costs very often unites them with the
Octobrists, and that is why it is so difficult to tell of some members of the
Party of Law and Order where the Black Hundred begins and where the Octobrist
ends.


Thus, the Russian revolution has in an extremely short period revealed the major
types of political parties that correspond to all the main classes of Russian
society. We have a party of the class-conscious socialist proletariat; parties
of the radical, or radically inclined, petty bourgeoisie, mainly of the rural
petty bourgeoisie, i.e., of the peasantry; liberal-bourgeois parties; and
reactionary bourgeois parties. The political formations fail to correspond to
the economic, class divisions only in that the two last-named groups correspond
not to two, but to three groups of political parties: the Cadets, the
Octobrists, and the Black Hundreds. This discrepancy, however, is fully
explained by the transient peculiarities of the present situation, when the
revolutionary struggle has become extraordinarily acute, when it is very
difficult to separate defence of the autocracy

    

from out-and-out defence of the monarchy, when the economic classification (for
progressive and for reactionary capitalism) naturally cuts across the political
classification (for or against the present government). However, the kinship
between the Cadets and the Octobrists is too obvious, and hardly any one can
deny that the formation of a big, “business”, liberal-bourgeois
party is inevitable.


To sum up: the process of formation of political parties in Russia strikingly
confirms the soundness of the theory of Marxism.



P. S. This article was written before the split in the Union of October
Seventeenth. Shipov’s resignation and the forth coming formation of a moderate
liberal party (the Left Octobrists, the Party of Peaceful Renovation, and the
Right Cadets) now definitely promise to reduce all the Russian political parties
to the four main types that we see in every capitalist country.


 
Notes
 

[1]

We say types of parties, firstly, because it is impossible to
keep track of all the small divisions, nor are they important (e.g., the
difference between, say, the Progressive Industrial Party, or the
Disc,[2]

and the Party of Law and Order is quite negligible); secondly, it would be
wrong to take into account only those parties which have formally appeared
in the political arena and to ignore clearly defined political trends. A
very slight change in the political atmosphere would suffice to convert
these trends into regular parties within a few weeks.—Lenin
 



[2]

“Disc”—the “Democratic Union of
Constitutionalists”, a counter revolutionary organisation which arose in
the autumn of 1905; it united representatives from the big nobility,
conservative sections of the industrial bourgeoisie and the upper
bureaucracy. At the end of 1905 the Disc was merged in the Octobrist Party.

The article “Guerrilla Actions” in Sotsial-Demokrat, No. I
(publication of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.), which has
just reached us, is the best possible confirmation of what we said in
Proletary, No. 5,[4]

about the stereotyped and non-historical
character of the current philistine arguments on this

       subject.[1]

The author fulminates against banditry, anarchism, Blanquism,
Tkachevism,[5]

highway robbery (“road robbers”, as
the bad translation from the German reads) in exactly the same way as the
liberals. The liberals are true to themselves when they repudiate as
“anarchy” all armed struggle against the government. A
Social-Democrat who, in words, does not reject such struggle, but who in fact
does not examine the question from this point of view, has virtually
gone over to the standpoint of liberalism. The following is a characteristic
example. “Insofar as the revolutionary parties countenance anarchy, they
turn the embitterment of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois classes against
themselves and so play into the hands of reaction.” Thus, either countenance
anarchic armed struggle or repudiate armed struggle altogether! There
is no other way, according to the writer. He does not admit the
possibility of organised, planned, ideological, politically educative
armed struggle. What a poor choice lie is faced with!


“Experience has already put an end to one of the forms of revolutionary
guerrilla action, viz., the expropriation of private and government property.”
But this is a sheer falsehood, comrade! It is impossible that you should be
unaware of Menshevik organisations which after the Unity

    

Congress have participated, directly or indirectly, in government
    expropriations, in “utilising”
    plunder, etc. It is a
    very bad thing when a Social-Democrat’s words do not accord with his
    deeds. It leads to hypocrisy. It is due either to a bad conscience (an
    explanation that we reject) or to an ill-considered, illogical theory.



Comrade Axelrod makes an angry reply in Sotsial-Demokrat  to our note
in Proletary, No.

  1.[2]

One and a half columns of small print are devoted
to expressions of bewilderment, exclamations, assurances and reproaches
addressed to us be cause we described his agitation for a labour congress as
“concealed” from the Party. Axelrod is quite unable to understand
what this means. And at the same time, he says him self: “In the near
future I shall utilise it (the opportunity that I have) to bring the
question of a labour congress into the arena of political
discussion” (our italics). Well, that should have been done long ago!
You should have begun by “bringing the question into the arena of
political discussion”, and not into that of circle
whispering. Then your agitation would have been correct from a party point of
view, frank and worthy of the revolutionary class. Then the bourgeois press
would not have been able to cause confusion among Social-Democrats and lower
their prestige by publishing sensational reports of this circle whispering and
giving rise to thousands of misconceptions. It is highly regrettable that even
now, in his belated and extremely prolix “letter to the editors”,
Axelrod evades the essence of the question, saying not a word
about what congress he is proposing, and when, on what basis, who is to convene
it and what precisely is its purpose. Axelrod passes over all this with phrases
like the following: the work of preparing for the congress will have an
invigorating effect on Social-Democracy “to the extent that this work is
imbued with really Social-Democratic content, i. e., to the extent that circle
interests and factional considerations are replaced by socio-political problems
and tasks that are most immediately connected with the vital interests of the
working class”.

 

For pity’s sake, comrade! This is indeed sheer emptiness clothed in
      high-sounding words. The preparation for the congress will invigorate
      Social-Democracy to the extent that it will be really Social-Democratic!
      How new and how wise! “Factional considerations” must be
      replaced by socio political problems and tasks,—but it is just
      different conceptions of these problems and tasks that have divided the
      Party into factions! It is a real cock-and-bull story.


And at Axelrod’s side Plekhanov utters gross and banal insinuations about the
motives of the struggle for a Party congress and equally gross eulogies of
Axelrod’s “happy idea” of convening a labour congress
“as soon as possible”. Yes, yes... What indeed could be a
happier idea than that real Social-Democratic work will invigorate
Social-Democracy?



In an editorial article of Sotsial-Demokrat we read:

“Now, as after the Second Congress, the two groups (Bolsheviks and
Mensheviks) are probably of equal strength numerically”, and a little
lower down we read for the second time:

“Now, as after the Second Congress, the two groups are equally influential
in the Party.” The writer’s idea is clear. In an editorial of the official
“publication of the Central Committee”, it acquires considerable
significance. The party of the working class ought to know precisely what its
“groups” consist of and how strong they are. What is the basis of
the opinion about their equality?


There are only two alternatives: either the writer has in mind only the Russian
section of the Party (plus the Caucasus) or he adds the Poles, Letts and the
Bund. On the first interpretation, the writer is admitting a vast increase in
the strength of the “Majority” at the expense of the
“Minority” since the Fourth (Unity) Congress, for at this Congress
there were represented about 13,000 Bolsheviks and 18,000 Mensheviks. But this
interpretation is improbable for it is already more than a month since all the
national Social-Democratic parties were amalgamated with the R.S.D.L.P. Hence
it is necessary to adopt the second interpretation. In that case it becomes
obvious that the writer allocates the Poles and Letts to the Bolsheviks and the
Bund to the Mensheviks. According to the data of the last congresses
of the

    

national Social-Democratic parties, the Poles and Letts number about 40,000 and
the Bund has a membership of about 33,000; thus we actually obtain approximately
equal numbers for each group.


The question arises, however, whether it is correct to allocate the Bund to the
Mensheviks. Of course, if the Central Committee says so, we must believe
it. But it is essential to be clear about the significance of such an
alignment. In the sphere of tactics, it is not confirmed by the latest
resolutions of the Bund taken in their entirety. Consequently, the explanation must
be sought in the organisational position of the Bund. It is evident
that the Central Committee’s publication considers as a real fact the
circumstance that the Bund is not demanding an extraordinary congress. Who ever
really wants to change the Party’s policy as a whole, i.e., the policy of the
Central Committee, is bound to demand a congress; anyone who does not demand
this does not seriously want a change—such is the essence of this line of
thought.


This reasoning is irrefutable and we regard it as our duty to assist all the
organisations of our Party to obtain a clear idea of it and correctly appraise
it. As a matter of fact, in a democratic organisation neutrality is almost
impossible and abstention is often equivalent to action. The result of this
“action” is clearly evident. The Central Committee’s publication
propagates the most confused ideas about a “labour congress” and
definitely and consistently adopts a Menshevik position in regard to
tactics. The con sequences that this threatens for the whole Party in the event
of an election campaign or new calls for action have been sufficiently
demonstrated by the “slogans” of the Central Committee during the
Duma session and after its dissolution. By its present
“abstention”, the Bund has actually made itself an accessory to the
Menshevik tactics and policy of the Central Committee.

Sotsial-Demokrat—an illegal newspaper, organ
of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., published in St. Petersburg from
September 17 (30) to November 18 (December 1), 1906; it was virtually a Menshevik
organ since at that time the Central Committee was in the hands of the
Mensheviks.





[4]

Proletary (The Proletarian)—an illegal
newspaper founded by the Bolsheviks after the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the
Party; it was published from August 21 (September 3), 1906 to November 28
(December 11), 1909, under the editorship of Lenin. Proletary carried
the title of organ of the Moscow and St. Petersburg Committees and, for a time,
also of the Moscow District, Perm, Kursk and Kazan committees. It was in fact
the Central Organ of the Bolsheviks. In all 50 issues appeared; the first 20
were published in Finland. Between February 13 (26) and December 1(14), 1908,
Proletary was published in Geneva, and after January 8 (21), 1909, in
Paris.


More than 100 articles and items by Lenin were published in Proletary.
During the years of Stolypin reaction it played a prominent role in holding
together and strengthening the Bolshevik organisations. At the plenary session
of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in January 1910 the
“conciliators” secured the adoption of a decision to close down
Proletary.





[5]

Tkachevism—a trend in revolutionary Narodism that was close to
Blanquism, called after its ideologist P. N. Tkachev (1844-85). The Tkachevists
considered political struggle to be a necessary prerequisite of revolution, hut
underestimated the decisive role of the masses. In the opinion of Tkachev, the
revolutionary minority should seize political power, establish a new state and
put through revolutionary changes in the interests of the people who have only
to make use of time ready-made results.


F. Engels criticised the petty-bourgeois revolutionism of Tkachev in his
article “Emigrant Literature”.

Tovarishch of September 20 publishes an extremely instructive
“conversation” between a Cadet and a certain more Left politician (a
Trudovik?) who expresses the point of view of
Mr. V. V. Kh—ov,[1]

a contributor to that paper. This is how the radical takes the Cadet to task:


“Is it not the other way round?” he asks the Cadet, who was declaiming that
only confidence in one’s rights can make one strong. “Is it not strength
that makes one confident in the inviolability of right?” “The activities
of your Party ...
I regard as political quixotry.... You have been bolstering up
fictions.”

“Your constitutional illusions are to blame.... All that you said, and
your way of saying it, created undue confidence in the power of the Duma. And
this has certainly not facilitated the accumulation of social forces.... I
always wished when I heard your speeches, in and outside the Duma, that you
would stop treating the Duma as a constitutional body and regard it merely as an
organ of the public will that was in conflict with another will.... The
situation demanded most of all the organisation of our forces.... The Duma
should have exerted every effort to create for itself the apparatus that the law
had not given it.... You are exposing your Achilles’ heel—constitutional
illusions.... I always had occasion to be convinced of one thing alone, and that
is, how deeply constitutional fictions have eaten into your Party.... I am
scolding [you, the Cadets] because you had ceased to feel that you were one of
the combatants, and were acting, so to speak, as liquidators of the struggle.

    

You proposed in a casual way what in other countries materialised as a
      result of a struggle between the rival forces.”


An instructive statement, is it not? Only it is a pity that our valiant
Bernsteinian “picked” a rather stupid Cadet to rounce in
“conversation”. There are some who are a bit marter. 

There are some
who closely watch Menshevik literature, particularly the writings of
Plekhanov. Such a Cadet would have answered his opponent differently.


He would have said: My dear Radical!

Qui prouve trop, ne prouve rien.
He who proves too much, proves nothing.

And you are undoubtedly proving far
too much from the point of view of your own case. Did you not support us in
the Duma elections and fight the boycotters? Now these elections put you under
certain obligations. The keynote of these elections was
entirely what you now call “constitutional
illusions”

(fie, fie, have you been reading Bolshevik literature?). Why, I could show you, my
dear Radical, a nice passage—and more than one—in your own paper
Tovarishch where you (not necessarily you personally, but your Party
colleagues) assured the credulous Russian philistine that bad Cabinet Ministers
would have to resign if the party of “people’s freedom” won the
elections. What’s that? You don’t remember, my dear Radical? But we remember it
very well. You could not take part in elections, my dear Sir, unless you
promised to be loyal, unless you swore to use only constitutional methods of
struggle. As for us, the party of people’s freedom, we make promises solely in
order to carry them out, and for no other reason!


You say we had too much faith in the power of the Duma, that this did not help
us to accumulate “our own” forces? But for God’s sake read
Plekhanov, whom you certainly regard as an authority. After all, it is you, your
colleagues, and not the Cadets, who are fond of stating in private conversation
that they are really quite Social-Democrats in all respects and would have
declared themselves such if ... if the Social-Democrats as a whole had entirely
adopted Plekhanov’s standpoint. And was it not Plekhanov who said at the Unity
Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party that only anarchists can
shout about constitutional illusions? Did not Plekhanov move a resolution in
which

    

the Duma was not only referred to as a power—and
    this title was confirmed by the Unity Congress of the
    Social-Democrats!!—but as a power “created by the tsar
    himself and sanctioned by
    law”? Did not Plekhanov himself write in the esteemed organ of the
    Mensheviks–and you gentlemen of Nasha Zhizn have always praised
    these tendencies of the Mensheviks!—that constructive work in the
    Duma has the most agitational effect? And you applauded Plekhanov; in the
    press you admired his “courage” (yes, that is exactly how you
    expressed it) in combating “Blanquism”! You have not managed,
    literally, to wear out your shoes since that happened, and yet you
    yourselves are already repeating these deplorable Blanquist fallacies!!


If the Cadet had defended himself like this, his defence would have been an
attack, and the radical would have been utterly discomfited....


By his present guerrilla attack on constitutional illusions this radical
reminds us of the hero of the popular epic who greeted a funeral procession with
the cry: “Many happy returns of the day.” Just think: when was the
struggle against constitutional illusions a vital and urgent necessity?
Obviously, when they were flourishing and could, and in fact did, cause
widespread harm by tempting the “small fry”. In other
words, when the masses might have imagined, and could not but imagine,
that there was a constitution, whereas there was none at all. This was exactly
the situation during the elections to the First Duma and while the Duma was
sitting, i.e., from March to June 1906. It was then that constitutional
illusions caused widespread harm. At that time, however, only the
Bolshevik Social-Democrats systematically combated them, swimming against the
stream. At that time Kh—ov and other contributors to “Nasha
Zhizn” fostered these illusions, “warring” with the
Bolsheviks, and scolding them for their sharp criticism of the Cadets.


Now, the Duma is dissolved. The Cadets are defeated. No one even imagines that
there is such a thing as a constitution. Now even not very noble animals may
kick the Cadets (“I scold them”—see the “conversation”) and
curse constitutional illusions at every fifth word. Ah, my dear Radicals! Your
action comes too late!

 

The case of Kh—ov & Co. provides an illuminating example of how
people who regard themselves as enlightened politicians, and even as
free.thinkers or radicals, drift with the tide, helpless and without
convictions, flabby and powerless. From March to June 1906 they fostered
constitutional illusions, calling the Duma a power, trailing behind the Cadets,
turning up their noses disdainfully at ruthless criticism of this, then
fashionable, party. In September 1906 they “scold” the Cadets and
“war” against constitutional illusions without realising that they
are lagging behind again, that this is not enough now, and that what is needed
is a direct call for a definite (determined by the preceding course of
historical development) form of revolutionary struggle.


It would be well if the example of these gentlemen taught the Russian
intelligentsia, which so prolifically produces such jelly-fish, to realise how
harmful opportunism is. Very often this word is wrongly regarded as
“merely a term of abuse” and no attempt is made to grasp its
meaning. The opportunist does not betray his party, he does not act as a
traitor, he does not desert it. He continues to serve it sincerely and
zealously. But his typical and characteristic trait is that he yields to the
mood of the moment, he is unable to resist what is fashionable, he is
politically short sighted and spineless. Opportunism means sacrificing the
permanent and essential interests of the party to momentary, transient and minor
interests. A slight revival of industry, a relative improvement in trade and a
slight revival of bourgeois liberalism, and the opportunist begins to shout:

Don’t frighten the bourgeoisie away, don’t fight shy of it, drop your
“phrase-mongering” about social revolution! The Duma has assembled,
a police-constitutional “spring” is in the air—and lo! the
opportunist is already calling the Duma a power, hastening to curse the
“fatal” boycott and hurrying forward with the slogan: support the
demand for a Duma, i.e., a Cadet, Cabinet. As soon as the tide turns, the
opportunist, just as sincerely, and just as inopportunely, begins to
“scold” the Cadets and demolish constitutional illusions.


If such moods characteristic of the intelligentsia prevail it
will be impossible to adopt a consistent policy worthy of

    

a genuinely revolutionary class and to pursue it steadfastly through all minor
      deviations and waverings so as to prepare for a selflessly bold and
      determined battle with the enemy. That is why the class-conscious
      proletariat must be critical of the intelligentsia which is coming over
      to its side and must learn to wage a ruthless struggle against opportunism
      in politics.

We have already made it clear more than once that the autocracy’s struggle
against the proletarian and peasant revolution inevitably hits the liberal
opposition too. Once the proletariat is silent, the pogrom-mongers’ government
will certainly not miss the opportunity to strangle the Cadets as well. It is
now engaged in throttling the Peaceful Renovators. At present it is looking none
too kindly even on the Octobrists. And if—thanks to the military
courts— even the crack of Brownings, the bursting of bombs and the
classical command: “Hands up!” cease for a while, it will be no guarantee,
of course, that the Cadets and the Peaceful Renovators will, at last, reach
their longed for peaceful haven of legal, constitutional struggle.


One might have thought that the tide of frantic reaction would have swept the
leaders of the liberal opposition far to the left. The dissolution of the Duma
has completely undermined constitutional illusions. There is not a member on the
staff of Tovarishch or Stolichnaya Pochta[1]

who could fail to see that now. The suppression of the Cadet press (the
whole of the provincial and a considerable part of the metropolitan press), the
banning of the congress, the refusal to legalise the party, the prosecution of
all the signatories of the Vyborg Manifesto, should, one would think, have
forced the Cadets to abandon the policy of organising public opinion and to
adopt, at last, the policy of organising the social forces. Furthermore, one
would think that if the Cadet leaders lack the heroic determination proudly to
go under ground, the whole following would there and then abandon such leaders.

 

The Cadet Congress has shown these calculations to be wrong. For the time
      being, at any rate. The Congress has sanctioned, though reluctantly, the
      policy of “marking time” or, more precisely, “don’t
      move”, proposed by the Central Committee. The Congress adopted a
      resolution on organising the social forces, but this was a purely platonic
      resolution, committing no one to anything, not even
    giving any indication of the purpose for which such forces could and should
    be organised. The Congress passed—by a relatively slight majority, it
    is true—the celebrated Point 4 of the resolution on tactics, which
    proclaims the party’s passive resistance to the passive resistance that is
    growing spontaneously among the masses of the people and is recommended by
    the Vyborg Manifesto. The Congress closed as the congress of the single and
    indivisible “party of people’s freedom”.


Nor, undoubtedly, could it have been different. The hour has not yet struck for
a split in the Cadet Party. While class contradictions have already irrevocably
driven large sections of the big bourgeoisie into the camp of open counter
revolution, they have not yet caused sufficient disintegration in the wide
sections of the middle and petty bourgeoisie who voted for the Cadets at the
elections. So far, there are no objective signs that the lower middle class in
the provinces has been infected with that bourgeois dread of revolution which
has already possessed the “gallows humanists” of the Guchkov type.


But this disintegration is progressing rapidly. And the Cadet leaders themselves
are not sure, of course, whether their motley “people’s freedom”
bloc will stand the test of the social and political struggle, which is
growing more and more acute.


The Russian revolution is certainly bound to reach that fatal boundary line,
beyond which the break-up of this bloc will be absolutely inevitable. That line
will be reached and crossed when the vortex of proletarian and peasant
uprising irrevocably draws into itself the broadest strata of the petty
bourgeoisie and part of the middle urban bourgeoisie. Then, but only
then, all that will actually remain of the huge Cadet bloc will be the
propertied middle bourgeoisie, who were surely destined at their birth to
share, in the long run, Mr. Guchkov’s bourgeois fears. Then the spectre

    

of national revolution which is still so potent at the present time, and which
is preventing many people from properly appraising the truly gigantic
constructive role of the class contradictions in the Russian revolution, will
vanish. When this boundary line is reached, a huge political party basing itself
on the organisation of public opinion will be a hopeless anachronism;
while all the elements of the real mass movement, both on the left and on the
right, will assign to force, naked physical force, that great, not only
destructive but also constructive role, without which, of course, the real con
summation of revolution is inconceivable. But where physical force comes into
its sovereign rights there is no place for Cadet bourgeois hegemony. The whole
history of our struggle bears witness to that fact; one need not be a prophet to
predict for certain that the same thing will happen if we experience a new
upsurge of the revolution. The Cadet is a “legitimate” participant
in the division of the spoils of the revolution—but he is no more than
that.


That is why, objectively, those Cadet leaders were right who proposed that the
Vyborg Manifesto be regarded simply as a mistake committed in the heat of the
moment since it directly calls for the adoption of the tactics of
passive resistance. For considering the intensity of the struggle today there
cannot be any mass passive resistance that will not immediately develop into an
active offensive. Mr. Struve is quite right when he says that such a civilised
method of struggle (as opposed, if you please, to the purely revolutionary,
aggressive method) is appropriate only against a civilised, constitutional
government. Who will doubt for a moment that the Stolypin gang will send out its
punitive expeditions at the very first signs of a mass refusal to pay taxes, or
a mass refusal to assign recruits for the army? Who will then stop the
population from defending itself, from passing to an active armed offensive?


And the Vyborg Manifesto, even at the very moment it was being signed, in its
purely Cadet interpretation, was at best only a threat to the government that
this would happen, and not a practical slogan. In this case, the Milyukovs and
Struves are really not to blame for the political simplicity of those provincial
Cadets who mistook this manifesto for a practical slogan. The fate of the
manifesto in the provinces

    

bears witness to this. The intimidated press spoke very little and very
      obscurely about this fate, but what it did say proves, we think, that the
      party of “people’s freedom”, as a party, has worked hard to
      apply the principle of passive resistance proclaimed by that manifesto to
      the manifesto itself. That being the Case, the Congress could only endorse
      this standpoint of the Cadets. The minority of the Congress, which at
      first was inclined to make some fuss over this endorsement, finally
      surrendered and remained in the party.


On the other hand, we get news every day from the interior of the country
that the idea of passive resistance has found a response among the mass of the
people. Non-payment of taxes, refusal to assign recruits, and boycott of the
authorities are beginning to become really practical slogans. No one is shutting
his eyes to the enormous organisational defects of this growing movement. No one
will deny that a certain amount of chaos is inevitable. But out of this chaos
will come order, the order of revolution, which is the highest stage of
chaotic, spontaneous popular outbreaks. The hatred of the masses who are today
seething under the tremendous pressure of the military-court constitution
cannot but break out, and here and there is actually breaking out in explosions
of open armed struggle. We do not have the data enabling us to predict for
certain that when the time comes for calling up recruits and collecting taxes an
uprising of the whole people will break out, even if only in the form of purely
passive resistance, but that there will be manifestations of such a struggle is
inevitable. And the Cadets are stepping aside in good time. “Our
conscience does not allow us to endorse this dangerous opinion”—declared
the Cadet Congress through Madame Tyrkova, a member of the Central Committee of
the Party.


But this invocation of conscience in no way alters the case. Even if approaching
events indicated with mathematical certainty the early triumph of a popular
revolution, the attitude of the leading circles of the Cadets would be no
different. This is proved by the whole past history of the Cadet Party, and the
negotiations with the pogrom-mongers for portfolios in the Cabinet marked the
culminating point of this history; objectively, they were far more
characteristic of it than the Vyborg Manifesto. One of the most authoritative

    

representatives of the Party, Professor Gredeskul, testifies to this in
the most definite manner (Rech, No. 180):

“We have lived with our people,” he says. “We have shared their
stormy impulses.” But that was the time of “boisterous, impetuous
youth”; now we have reached the age of “persistent and persevering
maturity”. And the palladium of this maturity is the election campaign,
with a platform in the shape of the Duma’s reply to the address from the throne.


The Cadet Party has never shared the “stormy impulses” of the
people, and never could do so; the learned professor orated like this merely by
way of a rhetorical flourish. Nor has the Cadet Party, as represented by its
Congress, moved to the right. It remains where it was. It intends, as hitherto,
to take part in the present revolutionary crisis only insofar as it may
degenerate into a purely parliamentary crisis.


We can only welcome the clear and explicit terms in which the Congress framed
its resolutions to that effect. Of course, it will greatly disappoint those who
regarded the Vyborg Manifesto as an indication that the Cadets were
“beginning to turn to the left” and as a striking sign that the
Russian revolution was acquiring a nation-wide character.


By declaring that it conceives the revolution only as a parliamentary struggle,
the Congress has put squarely before the broad democratic masses the question of
an open struggle for power. The whole course of the Russian revolution
indicates that the answer of these democratic masses to that question will differ
from that of the Cadets. And Social-Democrats must prepare for the moment when
that answer is forthcoming so that the urban and rural poor will find in the
Social-Democratic Party their natural leader in the period of revolution.

Periods of counter-revolution are marked, among other things, by the spread of
counter-revolutionary ideas, not only in a crude and direct form, but also in a
more subtle form, namely, the growth of philistine sentiments among the
revolutionary parties. Comrade Martov, in his latest pamphlet,
Political Parties in Russia, applies the term revolutionary parties both
to the Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary parties. We hope to return
some other time to this interesting pamphlet of Martov’s, in which he
criticises the Cadets with a candour and precision unusual in Menshevik literature,
but, at the same time, gives a completely false, non-Marxist classification of
our political parties and repeats the fundamental error of Menshevism by
classing parties of the Octobrist type with the “Centrist” parties.


But this is by the way. We are interested just now in certain other novel
features of Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary publications and
intend to note the most striking expressions, or rather reflections, of
counter-revolutionary moods in these circles. After the defeat of the December
uprising, the most conspicuous expression of counter revolutionary sentiment
among the democrats was the about f ace of the Cadets, who threw overboard the
constituent assembly slogan and, in the columns of Polyarnaya Zvezda
and similar publications, abused and vilified the participants in and
ideologists of the armed uprising. After the dissolution of the Duma and the
failure of the popular movements in July, a novelty in counter-revolutionary
sentiment among the democrats was the definite secession of the Right wing of
the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the formation of the semi-Cadet “Popular
Socialist” Party. After the first and

    

major upsurge of October-December, the Cadets dropped out of the ranks of
militant, fighting democrats. After the second, smaller upsurge of May-June, the
Popular Socialists began to drop out.


In Proletary, No. 4, we outlined the main ideological and political
features of these Popular

     Socialists.[1]

Since then they have managed to come out
quite officially; they have published the programme of their “Trudovik (Popular
Socialist)” Party— changing the Socialist-Revolutionary programme from a
revolutionary into an opportunist, petty-bourgeois and legal programme, and have
published the names of the members of the organising committee of the new
party. True, among the seventeen members of this organising committee
(Messrs. Annensky, Yelpatyevsky, Myakotin, Peshekhonov and others) there is only
one ex-member of the Duma from the “Trudovik Group”,
Mr. Kryukov, a high-school teacher and publicist. The founders of the new
Toilers’ Party do not include a single big name from the real
“Trudoviks”! It is not surprising that some people call the Popular
Socialists pretender Trudoviks. It is not surprising that news of other Trudovik
parties has already appeared in the press. Tovarishch reported that
Mr. Sedelnikov, who, of course, is a much more prominent “Trudovik”
and much better known to the public for his activities in the Duma than the
quite obscure Mr. Kryukov, is forming a Popular Trudovik Party. At a
large meeting reported in Tovarishch, Mr. Sedelnikov frankly and openly
defended his ideas, making no claim to be a socialist and raising the standard
of a “democratic monarchy”. According to the same report, the
directness and frankness of this Trudovik from the ranks of the people roused
the great ire of the Trudovik journalist, Mr. Myakotin, who, in replying,
championed the views of the Popular Socialists.


The details of this family quarrel do not interest us. The only important thing
for us to note is the various expressions of opportunist trends among former
Socialist-Revolutionaries and certain “Trudoviks”. In this respect,
Mr. Peshekhonov is making more “progress” than anybody (among the
S.-R.’s there are much bolder “progressive innovators” than

    

    among us). In the September issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo he goes further
    and further on his way from the revolutionaries to the Cadets. He tries to
    erase the difference between the revolutionary “take” and the
    Cadet “receive”. After “proving” in August that it
    is impossible to take either full freedom or all the land, he now
    “proves” that it is impossible “to take freedom from
    below.

Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte, or, as we say in
    Russia, the first glass must be forced down, the second trickles down, and
    all the others glide down in a merry stream.

    In the columns of a legally
    published periodical, this neo-Cadet [publicist] rails against the idea of
    an armed uprising, the idea of a provisional revolutionary government,
    without calling things by their name, of course, and without quoting in full
    the manifesto of the revolutionary parties which he is
    “refuting”. He distorts and vulgarises in the free press the
    ideas of those who in the illegal press upheld the idea of an uprising, the
    idea of a provisional revolutionary government. Indeed, the Popular
    Socialists have not legalised their party for nothing! It can be taken for
    granted that they have legalised it not to defend the idea of an uprising,
    but to condemn it!


An important novelty as regards the reflection of counter revolutionary moods in
Social-Democratic literature has been the publication of the Moscow weekly
Nashe Dyelo.[4]

The Cadet press has already deafened
everyone with its trumpeting about this new and important “progress”
of the Mensheviks: they are “progressing”, as we know, from the
revolutionaries to the Cadets. Rech published a special welcoming
article; Tovarishch delightedly repeated the main ideas contained in
Nashe Dyelo; Rech repeated the opinions of Tovarishch;
Tovarishch confirmed its own views by quoting Rech; in short, the
enlightened company of the educated betrayers of the Russian revolution are in
an extraordinary state of rapturous excitement. Rech has even heard
from some source that Nashe Dyelo is edited by the prominent
Mensheviks, Messrs. Maslov, Cherevanin, Groman and Valentinov.


We do not know whether Rech’s information is correct, although it
usually makes great claims to being well-in formed about all Menshevik
affairs. But we do know Cherevanin’s leading article in Nashe Dyelo,
No. 1. It is worth while quoting the passage which so delighted the Cadets.

 

“It would be an absurdity and folly for the proletariat to try, as some
propose, to fight in league with the peasantry against the government and the
bourgeoisie for a national constituent assembly with full power”
(p. 4). “We must insist on the convocation of a new Duma.” The
Cabinet must be formed from the Duma majority. “With the peasantry
completely unorganised, and terribly ignorant as they are at present, it is
difficult to expect more” (p. 6). As you see, this is frank
... angelically frank. Comrade Cherevanin has gone much further to the right,
while remaining in the ranks of a revolutionary party, than Mr. Peshekhonov, who
has formed a new “legal party”. Mr. Peshekhonov has not yet
abandoned the constituent assembly slogan and is still criticising the
demand for a Duma Cabinet as inadequate.


Not wishing to insult the intelligence of our readers, we will not, of course,
attempt to prove the fallacy of Cherevanin’s position. His name has already
become a by-word among all Social-Democrats, irrespective of faction. But we do
invite our readers to reflect most earnestly on the reasons for this incredibly
easy conversion of a prominent and responsible Menshevik into a liberal. It is
not difficult to condemn and reject a glaringly obvious “extreme”,
“excess”, of opportunism. It is much more important to lay bare the
source of these mistakes which cause Social-Democrats to blush with shame. We
invite our readers to reflect on whether there is really any greater difference
between Cherevanin and our Central Committee than there is between Sedelnikov
and Peshekhonov.


The underlying motives of the whole of this “quartet” are the
same. People of a philistine, petty-bourgeois type are weary of the
revolution. A little, drab, beggarly but peaceful legality is preferable to the
stormy alternations of revolutionary outbursts and counter-revolutionary
frenzy. Inside the revolutionary parties this tendency is expressed in a desire
to reform these parties. Let the philistine become the main nucleus of the
party: “the party must be a mars party”. Down with illegality, down
with secrecy, which hinders constitutional “progress”! The old
revolutionary parties must be legalised. And this necessitates a radical reform
of their programmes in two main directions: political and economic. We must
drop the demand for a republic and the confiscation

    

      of the land, we must discard our clearly defined, uncompromisingly
      sharp and tangible exposition of the socialist goal and represent
      socialism as a “remote prospect”, as Mr. Peshekhonov has
      expressed it with such inimitable grace.


It is these strivings that the different representatives of our
“quartet” express on different grounds and in different
forms. Sedelnikov’s democratic monarchy; the “progress” from the
Trudovik to the Cadet in the “Popular Socialist” Party; Cherevanin’s
rejection of the revolutionary struggle for a constituent assembly; Axelrod’s
and Plekhanov’s labour congress; our Central Committee’s slogan “for the
Duma”; the arguments in No. I of Sotsial-Demokrat, published by
this same Central Committee, about the conservatism of secret organisation and
underground activities, and the progressiveness of going over to the
“nation-wide bourgeois revolution”—all these are manifestations of a
single, fundamental striving, all form a single current of the philistinism
that is showing itself among the revolutionary parties.


From the point of view of legalising the Party, of “bringing it
closer” to the masses, of reaching agreement with the Cadets, of
association with the nation-wide bourgeois revolution, Cherevanin quite
logically proclaimed the struggle for a constituent assembly an
“absurdity and folly”. We have already pointed out in
Proletary, No.

  1,[2]

that our Central Committee glaringly contradicts
itself by advocating in its famous “Letters to Party Organisations”
(Nos. 4 and 5) an alliance with the middle bourgeoisie, the officers, etc., and
at the same time putting forward the slogan of a constituent assembly, which is
unacceptable to them. In this respect Cherevanin argues more
consistently and more correctly, or more honestly and frankly, than the
Peshekhonovs or our Central Committee. The latter’s Sotsial-Demokrat is
either trying to be cunning or it displays a striking lack of thought when, on
the one hand, it fulminates against “roads which lead the proletariat away
from the nation-wide movement”, “dooming it to political
isolation”, and, on the other hand, it upholds the constituent assembly
slogan and says: “it is necessary to prepare for an uprising”.

 

Take the labour congress. Recently (October 6) the Cadet newspaper
Tovarishch at last blurted out the secret of this congress. According
to the report of this newspaper ,the following is what was said by “one of
the veteran Social-Democratic leaders, who raised the question of a labour
congress”, in a lecture delivered by him a few days ago: “They [the
members of the “labour congress”] can adopt the entire programme of
Social-Democracy with, perhaps, a few alterations, and then the Party will
emerge from its underground existence.” The position is quite clear. The veteran
leaders are ashamed to say openly that they want the programme of the Party
changed so that it can go over to a legal position. Well, suppose we say: get
rid of the republic, the constituent assembly and mention of the socialist
dictatorship of the proletariat, add that the Party wages a struggle only by
legal means (as was said in the programme of the German Social-Democrats prior
to the Anti-Socialist Law[5]),

etc. “Then the Party
will emerge from its underground existence — so the “veteran
leaders” imagine—then the passage will be accomplished from
“conservative” illegality, revolutionism and underground existence
to “progressive” constitutional legality. Such is the bashfully
concealed essence of the labour congress. A labour congress is the chloroform
which the veteran leaders prescribe for the “conservative”
Social-Democrats, in order to be able to perform on them the

pain less 

operation
carried out by the Peshekhonovs on the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The only
difference is that the Peshekhonovs are practical businessmen and know where
they are going, whereas it would be unjust to say that of our veteran
leaders. They do not understand that in the present political situation a
labour congress is just idle talk; when this situation changes in the direction
of a revolutionary upswing, a labour congress will by no means bring with it
the triumph of philistinely tranquil legality, if at that time the expansion of
the revolutionary Social-Democratic Party will not have made a labour congress
superfluous; and if the present situation changes in the direction of a complete
and lasting victory of reaction, a labour congress will then be able to cut
down the Social-Democratic programme to an extent that will horrify even
Axelrod.

 

That the Cadet press gives its utmost support to the idea of a labour congress
    is quite understandable for it has a flair for seizing on the philistine
    and opportunist tendencies of this scheme. It is not for nothing that
    Mr. Portugalov—a Cadet who considers himself a non-party
    socialist—is delight ed by the “wise position” of
    Axelrod, seizes on his contemptuous words about the Party as a
    “circle organisation” (a “circle” with
    100,000-150,000 members; i.e., on the European scale, with one to
    one-and-a-half million votes at elections!) and asks with an air of
    importance: “Is the class for the party or the party for the class?”
    Let us answer this wise question by another addressed to the bourgeois
    writers:

    is the head for the stomach or the stomach for the head?


Finally, let us take the arguments of the Central Committee’s
Sotsial-Demokrat. The same Mr. Portugalov accurately seized on their
essence when he quoted a passage no less worthy of renown than the statements of
Cherevanin. “It [the Menshevik trend] attempted to meet halfway the
inevitable conversion of the underground revolutionary struggle of the
intelligentsia, who base themselves on the leading sections of the proletariat,
into a national bourgeois revolution.” Mr. Portugalov comments: “Not so
long ago such threats [?misprint? such ideas?] were invariably declared a heresy
of ’bourgeois-democratic’ origin. Now ’bourgeois democrats’ have nothing to add
to these remarks.”


Mr. Portugalov is right. It is not only in the recent past that the argument of
the leader writer in Sotsial-Demokrat was declared the fruit of
bourgeois-democratic ideas, it is declared to be such now and will be so
declared in the future. Just reflect, indeed, on this argument. It is possible
for an underground struggle to be converted into an open one, for a struggle of
the intelligentsia to be converted into a people’s or mass struggle, for the
struggle of the leading sections of the class to be converted into one of
the entire class, but the conversion of an underground revolutionary struggle
into a national bourgeois revolution is sheer gibberish. The real significance
of this argument is the substitution of the stand point of bourgeois democracy
for the standpoint of the proletariat.


“Two years of civil war have brought about a national revolution in our
country. That is a fact,...” says the leader

    

writer of Sotsial-Demokrat. It is not a fact, but a phrase. The civil
war in Russia, if we take this term seriously, has not been going on for two
years. In September 1904 there was no civil war. To stretch the concept of civil
war out of ill proportion will only be to the advantage of those who ignore the
special tasks of the workers’ party in a period of real civil
war. The Russian revolution was much more national before October 17, 1905, than
it is today. It is sufficient to point to the desertion of the landlords to the
reactionary camp. It is sufficient to recall the formation of counter
revolutionary parties of the “Octobrist” type, and the
unquestionable accentuation of counter-revolutionary characteristics among the
Cadets in the summer of 1906, as compared with the Osvobozhdeniye League
in the summer of 1905. A year ago the Osvobozhdeniye people did not and
could not talk about stopping the revolution; Struve took the side of the
revolution. Now the Cadets say openly that their aim is to stop the revolution.


What, then, does this conversion of the underground revolutionary struggle into
a national bourgeois revolution amount to in practice? To ignoring, or
obscuring, the class contradictions which have already been revealed by the
course of the Russian revolution. To converting the proletariat from a fighting
vanguard, pursuing an independent revolutionary policy, into an
appendage of that faction of the bourgeois democrats which is most in the
limelight, which lays most claim to represent “national”
aspirations. Hence it is clear why the bourgeois liberal had to say: We have
nothing to add to this, we quite agree, we are striving for the conversion of
the proletarian struggle into a national struggle. To convert it into a
nation-wide struggle (or, what is the same thing, a national revolution) means
to take what is common to the Cadet and other parties more to the left and
declare it to be binding, cutting out everything else as “dooming the
proletariat to political isolation”. In other words, subscribe to the
demands of the Cadets, for any other demands will not be
“national”. Hence, naturally, the slogans of half-hearted
Social-Democratic opportunism: “for the Duma as an organ of power which
will convene the constituent assembly”, or for the Duma as a “lever
for winning a constituent assembly” (Sotsial-Demokrat,
No. 1). Hence the motto

    

of consistent Social-Democratic opportunism: it would be an absurdity and folly
      to fight for a constituent assembly, for the demand for a constituent
      assembly “dooms the proletariat to political isolation”,
      exceeds the bounds of a “national bourgeois revolution”, etc.


Revolutionary Social-Democrats must argue differently. Instead of uttering
phrases about “a national bourgeois revolution”, which are too
general and too easily lend themselves to bourgeois distortion, we must
analyse the concrete position of definite classes and parties at various moments
in the revolution. In 1900 and 1901 the old Iskra and
Zarya[6]

quite rightly spoke of Social-Democracy as the carrier of
the ideas of national emancipation, as the fighting vanguard which endeavoured
to win over to its side all elements, including even liberal Marshals of the
Nobility. This was true at that time, for, as yet, there was nothing, absolutely
nothing in the policy of the government that could satisfy even the mildest
bourgeois liberalism. The Russian general strike in October proved that this was
true; for the proletarian struggle then became the centre of attraction for
all sorts of bourgeois liberals, even the very mildest.


After October 17 things changed, they had to change. The liberal-monarchist
bourgeoisie (Comrade Martov is wrong to call it a
“liberal-democratic” bourgeoisie) had to rise in defence of the
monarchy and landlordism, to do so directly (Octobrists) or indirectly (Cadets),
for the further victories of the revolution were becoming a serious and
immediate menace to these charming institutions. Those who forget that with the
progress of revolution and the growth of its tasks a change takes place in the
composition of the classes and elements of the people capable of taking part in
the struggle for the achievement of these aims fall into grievous
error. Through the bourgeois revolution the proletariat marches to
socialism. Therefore, in the course of the bourgeois revolution it must raise
and enlist for the revolutionary struggle more and more revolutionary strata of
the people. In 1901 the proletariat roused the Zemstvo liberals. Now, because of
the objective conditions, its main task is to rouse, educate and mobilise for
the struggle the revolutionary peasantry, to deliver them from the ideological
and political tutelage not only of the Cadets pure and simple,

    

but of the Trudoviks of the Peshekhonov type. If the revolution can triumph it
will do so only as a result of an alliance between the proletariat and
the really revolutionary, not the opportunist, peasantry. Therefore, if we
seriously say that we stand for revolution (and not only for a constitution), if
we are seriously speaking of a “new revolutionary upsurge”, we must
strenuously combat all attempts to discard the constituent assembly slogan, or
to weaken it by linking it with the Duma (the Duma as an organ of power which
will convene the constituent assembly, or the Duma as a lever for winning a
constituent assembly, etc.), or by trimming down the tasks of the proletariat to
the limits of a Cadet or alleged national bourgeois revolution. Of the mass of
the peasantry, only the well-to-do and middle peasants will inevitably become
opportunist and, later, even reactionary. But these constitute the minority of
the peasantry. The poor peasantry together with the proletariat constitute the
overwhelming majority of the people, the nation. This majority
can triumph, and will triumph completely, in the bourgeois revolution,
i.e., can win complete freedom and all the land and attain the highest
level of prosperity possible for workers and peasants in capitalist society. You
can, if you will, call such a revolution of the majority of the nation a
national bourgeois revolution, but anyone can see that the ordinary meaning of
these words is quite different, that their actual meaning at the present time is
a Cadet meaning.


We are “conservative” Social-Democrats in the sense that we stand
for the old revolutionary tactics. “The proletariat must carry the
democratic revolution to completion, allying to itself the mass of the peasantry
in order to crush the autocracy’s resistance by force and paralyse the
bourgeoisie s instability” (Two

    Tactics).[3]

This was written in
the summer of 1905. Now the stakes are higher, the task is harder, the impending
battle will be sharper. We must paralyse the in stability of the whole
bourgeoisie, including the intellectualist and the peasant bourgeoisie. We must
rally to the proletariat the poor peasantry, which is capable of waging a
determined revolutionary struggle. Not our own desires but objective conditions
will set before the “new revolutionary

    

    upsurge” precisely these lofty tasks. The class-conscious
    proletariat must do its duty to the very end.


P. S. This article had already been sent to the press when we read Comrade
Martov’s letter to Tovarishch. L. Martov dissociates himself from
Cherevanin on the question of forming a bloc with the Cadets. Very good. But it
is astonishing and extremely deplorable that L. Martov does not dissociate
himself from Cherevanin’s discovery: “the absurdity and folly of
fighting for a constituent assembly”, although he must have known
of this discovery from Tovarishch, No. 73, which he quotes. Has Martov,
too, already “progressed” as far as Cherevanin?

## Lies Spread







Lenin: 1906/boupress: Lies Spread by L. Martov Through the Columns of the Bourgeois Press







V. I.  

      Lenin
Martov’s and Cherevanin’s Pronouncements in the Bourgeois Press
Telling How Certain Social-Democrats Resort to Bourgeois, Cadet Newspapers, Like Tovarishch, and, Through Tovarishch, to the Novy Put, in Order to Spread False Reports About Revolutionary Social-Democracy. Refutation. Estimation. Conclusions.


Lies Spread by L. Martov Through the Columns of the
Bourgeois Press

The bourgeois Cadet newspaper Tovarishch of October 12 (No. 85)
reprints without comment the following passage from another Cadet paper
Novy Put: “We [Novy Put] cannot but admit that in
insisting on a permanent bloc with the extreme Lefts (as we learn from
Mr. Martov’s letter) they [the Bolsheviks] are more logical than Mr. Martov.”


Thus, Novy Put refers directly to L. Martov in confirmation of its
false report about the Bolsheviks.


It is necessary to establish the facts.


In No. I of the “Bolshevik” Proletary the following was
said in an article entitled “The Boycott” (p. 3). “We shall
convene the Fifth Party Congress; there we shall resolve that in the event of
elections taking place, it will be necessary to enter into an electoral
agreement, for a few weeks, with the Trudoviks (unless the Fifth Party Congress
is convened it will be impossible to conduct a united election campaign; and
’blocs with other parties’ are absolutely prohibited by the decision of the
Fourth Congress). And then we shall utterly rout the

       Cadets.”[1]
    

This is all, to our knowledge, that has been said so far in
    Social-Democratic literature on the attitude of the Bolsheviks to electoral
    agreements. Clearly, Novy Put has been misled by
    L. Martov. Firstly, far from insisting on such a thing, the Bolsheviks have
    never even mentioned “a permanent bloc with the extreme
    Lefts”. Secondly, as regards all “blocs”
    whatsoever, the Bolsheviks have demanded that the existing decision
    be revised at the next Congress. This fact is wrongfully suppressed
    by those who dread the next Congress of the
    Social-Democratic Labour Party. And it is also wrongfully suppressed by the
    bourgeois newspapers, which falsely report to their readers, or create the
    false impression, that the Social-Democrats do not formally
    prohibit all blocs.


Thirdly: L. Martov, writing for the bourgeois newspapers, deliberately, or
through inadvertence or ignorance, conveys to the public, through the medium of
the Cadet paper Tovarishch, the idea that the Bolsheviks sanction
electoral agreements at the lowest stage of the election too, i.e., in
conducting agitation among the masses, whereas he, L. Martov, regards
as expedient only “partial agreements at the highest stages of our
multi-stage electoral system”.


L. Martov has no facts to support this assertion. L. Martov is
spreading a lie through the columns of the bourgeois press, for the
Bolsheviks proposed an agreement only for the highest stages,
only with the Trudoviks, only for a few weeks and only with the
consent of the Fifth Congress.


To spread this lie, which can easily reach the masses in view of the
notorious tendency of Cadet newspapers to sympathise with the Mensheviks and
sympathetically reprint any slander they choose to utter against the Bolsheviks,
L. Martov used an “abbreviated” version of the views of
Proletary. Although these views are fully expressed in the space of
the five printed lines quoted in full above, L. Martov found it necessary, none
the less, to abbreviate them and, moreover, render them in his own
words. The reader will see that Martov’s abridged version is tantamount
to a sheer distortion.


In the five lines in Proletary the subject is mentioned in passing. No
specific reference is made there to either the

    

highest or lowest stages of the elections. It may be objected, therefore, that
I, too, have no grounds for asserting that these five lines do not refer to
agreements at the first stage. But such an objection can be made only by one who
desires to quibble over a word and to distort the obvious meaning of someone’s
argument.


Undoubtedly, a five-line statement of the question leaves many gaps; but does
the general trend of the article, and its whole content, warrant a wider rather
than narrower interpretation of the omissions (as regards agreements)?


In any case, even the “letter” of the quotation (unless
“abbreviated” à la Martov) is undoubtedly opposed to a
wider interpretation, because anyone with the slightest experience of elections
will understand that an agreement at the first stage cannot be
limited to “a few weeks” but must necessarily be for
months. Suffice it to say that already, in St. Petersburg,
the parties are being mentioned which are seeking an election bloc with the
Cadets; and already the approximate distribution of Duma seats for the
city of St. Peters burg between the Cadets and these parties is reported. It is
said that the elections will probably take place on December 17. Two months
before that date, the people who really desire first-stage agreements are
already beginning to come to terms, directly or through intermediaries. Take
into account also the duration of the actual elections, add the time necessary
for a party decision on this question, the time necessary for sending
party directives from the centre to every part of Russia—and you
will see that agreements between parties for the first stage of the elections
will take months, while a “few weeks” will only just
suffice for a final-stage

argeement, 

i.e., the distribution of seats after the
contest, based on a calculation of the forces revealed by the direct vote of the
electors.


Finally, Since I have been compelled to make a statement in the press on this
question, I think it would be improper to refrain from stating my own personal
opinion. In the present political situation I would advocate the following at
the Fifth Congress: no blocs or agreements whatever between the
Social-Democrats and any other parties to be tolerated at the lowest stage of
the elections. We must appear

    

    before the masses at election time absolutely independently. At the
    highest stages agreements with the Trudoviks may be permitted exclusively
    for the proportional distribution of seats and on the condition that we
    “make” the non-party Trudoviks party men, counterposing
    the opportunists among them and the semi-Cadets (Popular Socialists,
    “Popular Socialist Party”, etc.) to the revolutionary bourgeois
    democrats.

## Martov and Cherevanin









Lenin: 1906/boupress: Martov and Cherevanin







V. I.  

      Lenin
Martov’s and Cherevanin’s Pronouncements in the Bourgeois Press
Telling How Certain Social-Democrats Resort to Bourgeois, Cadet Newspapers, Like Tovarishch, and, Through Tovarishch, to the Novy Put, in Order to Spread False Reports About Revolutionary Social-Democracy. Refutation. Estimation. Conclusions.



    

Martov and Cherevanin

In Tovarishch, L. Martov has refuted Cherevanin, who spoke of an
agreement with the Cadets. In the same Tovarishch, Cherevanin now
explains the “misunderstanding”. According to these explanations,
Cherevanin did not really say definitely in No. 1 of Nashe Dyelo
whether he advocates agreements at the lowest or the highest stages. In
substance, however, he declares in favour of permitting agreements also
at the lowest stages in the rural districts as well as in the towns.
Cherevanin does not say with which parties agreements may be made. He (and
apparently Martov, too) sees no difference between the revolutionary and the
opportunist bourgeoisie, between the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Cadets,
between the Trudoviks of the type of the "33" in the Duma and the Trudoviks
of the “Popular-Socialist” type, etc. Moreover, Cherevanin would
even allow voting, without an agreement, for bourgeois candidates at the
lowest stages of the elections!


Thus, Cherevanin’s position becomes perfectly clear. This not only prominent (as
attested by the bourgeois press) but also highly responsible Menshevik, who,
moreover, is the head of the weekly Nashe Dyelo, approves of all kinds
of blocs and is even in favour of Social-Democrats voting for bourgeois
candidates. Hence, the Bolsheviks were absolutely right when they said that the
Mensheviks are trying to convert the working class into an appendage of the
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie and to degrade the role of the Social-Democrats
to that of yes-men of the Cadets.


Let no one be mistaken now about the true meaning of the usual Menshevik slogan:
for the Duma, as an organ, or lever, or instrument, etc., of the
revolution. In order to support

    

the revolution, the Mensheviks are supporting the “Duma” as
such. And in order to support the Duma as such, they are prepared to vote, even
without an agreement, for the candidates of the Cadet Party, which wants to put
a stop to the revolution!


Remember the French Socialists like Millerand, Viviani and Briand, who are now,
under Clemenceau’s leadership, serenely governing arch-bourgeois France, sending
troops against strikers, etc. In order to support socialism, they called for
support of the republic in general, the republic as such. In order to support
the republic, they voted, with and without agreements, for commonplace bourgeois
politicians, for the opportunists. Thus, slowly but surely, they themselves
were converted into commonplace supporters of bourgeois oppression.


Cherevanin and his like have now come out on the main road, the beaten track!


What about Martov? He is opposed to agreements at the lowest stages. He has
repudiated Cherevanin. This is very gratifying. Only ... only just see
how he did it. Every sensible politician subordinates his electoral
tactics to his general political tactics. Thanks to the kind services of the
Cadet papers, Cherevanin’s tactics are now manifest to all.

“It would be
an absurdity and folly for the proletariat to try, as some propose, to fight in
league with the peasantry against the government and the bourgeoisie for a
national constituent assembly with full power.” This famous dictum of
Cherevanin’s was cited in the same number of Tovarishch which
evoked L. Martov’s “reply”. Yet, while repudiating Cherevanin’s
electoral tactics, Martov said not a word against this underlying
principle of Cherevanin’s political tactics as a whole.


Who is the more consistent of these two? Whose is the firmer stand? For the Duma
or for the revolution? For the Duma as such means: for the Cadets, which means:
against the constituent assembly. For the revolution means: only for a certain
part of the Duma on certain conditions, which means: against the Cadets, which
means: at the present time it would be an absurdity and folly to abandon, or
even to tone down, the demand for a constituent assembly.

## Bourgeois Newspapers









Lenin: 1906/boupress: Social-Democrats and Bourgeois Newspapers







V. I.  

      Lenin
Martov’s and Cherevanin’s Pronouncements in the Bourgeois Press
Telling How Certain Social-Democrats Resort to Bourgeois, Cadet Newspapers, Like Tovarishch, and, Through Tovarishch, to the Novy Put, in Order to Spread False Reports About Revolutionary Social-Democracy. Refutation. Estimation. Conclusions.



    

Social-Democrats and Bourgeois Newspapers

Is it permissible for a Social-Democrat to contribute to bourgeois newspapers?


Certainly

riot. 

Theoretical considerations, political etiquette and the
practice of the European Social-Democrats are all against it. As is well
known, this question came up for discussion at a recent congress of the German
Social Democrats.[2]

We know that our German comrades severely condemn
the idea of Social-Democrats contributing to the bourgeois press and resolutely
fight for the principle that the party of the revolutionary proletariat shall
tolerate no blocs or agreements in this field either, but maintain its
independence; that journalist members of the workers’ party should be organised and
controlled, not only in name but in deed; in ether words, should be
party men in the strict sense of the term.


Have we any right to depart from these rules here in Russia?


Some might retort: there is an exception to every rule. That is quite true. It
would be wrong to condemn a person in banishment for writing to any
newspaper. It is some times hard to condemn a Social-Democrat who is working in
a minor department of a bourgeois newspaper to earn a living. One can justify
the publication of an urgent and business-like refutation, etc., etc..


But see what will happen here. Under the pretext of refuting
“misunderstandings” caused by the Social-Democratic
“Nashe Dyelo”, L. Martov writes almost two columns in a Cadet
newspaper, calmly expounding the views of some Social-Democrats, arguing
against other Social-Democrats and misrepresenting the views of
Social-Democrats he disagrees with, without caring in the least what pleasure
his literary “bloc” with the Cadets gives to all the enemies of the
proletariat. The Cadet newspapers seize on L. Martov’s article in the Cadet
press, give it wide publicity, add a thing or two of their own to the lie which
he has put into circulation about the revolutionary Social-Democrats, pat him on
the back (see Rech), and so on and so forth. Cherevanin is tempted. If
Martov could write to Tovarishch to refute Cherevanin’s
“misunderstandings” and bring in thousands of other things

    

at the same time, why should not Cherevanin also write to Tovarishch to
refute L. Martov’s “misunderstandings”? And, while he is about it, why not
take advantage of the opportunity to start in the Cadet press (after all, it
would be improper to do so in the Social-Democratic press!) a discussion on the
question whether socialists should vote for bourgeois candidates even without an

      agreement?[1]


And so a special feature has been inaugurated in Cadet newspapers: a
family-literary correspondence between Social-Democratic opportunists. Since
its subject is the permissibility of blocs with the Cadets, and even of voting
for the Cadets, the Cadets readily give shelter to the homeless
“progressive” Social-Democrats who are departing from the
“conservative” rules of revolutionary Social—Democracy.


The Menshevik literary bigwigs dwell in two abodes. In the respectable quarter
they talk to fine gentlemen about blocs with the Cadets and incidentally retail
anecdotes about the revolutionary Social-Democrats. In the grimy quarter, in
some workers’ newspaper or Social-Democratic periodical, or a leaflet, they
offer the workers a “non-party labour congress” and enlighten them
on the absurdity and folly of fighting for a constituent assembly. Let the
workers be patient and wait a little: when the Social-Democratic discussion in
the Cadet Tovarishch on blocs between socialists and the bourgeoisie
comes to an end, the workers, too, will learn something.... And so, following
the homely rule of one of Turgenev’s characters,[3]

our advocates of a labour congress write letter after letter to
Tovarishch, murmuring the while: our Party is a party of the
intelligentsia....


Will not the Social-Democratic workers intervene to put a stop to this outrage?
Is it a matter of indifference to the members of our Party?

F. Dan has migrated to Tovarishch even without the object of
refuting “misunderstandings”, but merely for company’s sake.—Lenin
 



[2]

V. I. Lenin has in mind the Dresden Congress of the German
Social-Democratic Party held September 13-20, 1906. The Congress adopted a
resolution prohibiting party members from contributing
to the bourgeois press.

This refers to Turgenev’s poem A Rule of
Life (from the cycle Poems in Prose), whose character ascribes his
own shortcomings
to his opponent.

Both issues of the Central Committee’s Sotsial-Demokrat contain
articles by Plekhanov and Martov against the calling of an extraordinary
congress. These articles are written in such an angry and excited tone, are so
saturated with bitterness, irritation, personal insinuations and suspicion that
they immediately recall the atmosphere of the worst period of émigré
squabbles. By publishing these and only these articles on the Congress
in its own journal, the Central Committee of our Party puts itself in
a very unseemly position. Just imagine: the responsible ministry of a
democratically organised working-class party is absolutely beside itself and
loses all self-control because there is agitation for another congress! Why, it
is simply indecent, comrades. By raging and fuming against agitation for the
revision of your man dates and your tactics you are strongly
condemning

your selves. 

If any one in favour of a congress took pleasure in
being malicious he could wish for nothing better than to have the articles of
Plekhanov and Martov reprinted and widely distributed!


But why is opposition to a congress expressed in the name of the Central
Committee by people who can only talk in an injured, almost sobbing tone?
Because the two main facts which made agitation for another congress inevitable
are too clear and simple. One of these facts concerns the composition of the
Party, the other concerns its tactics.


At the time of the Unity Congress our Party membership consisted of 13,000
Bolsheviks and 18,000 Mensheviks. The Central Committee, and the Central Organ
even more so, express the opinion of the 18,000. Now 14,000 Letts,

    

26,000 Poles and 33,000 Bundists have joined the

Party.[1]

The leading article in
Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 1, unequivocally admits in two places that at
the present time both factions in the Party are about equal in size. This
opinion is evidently arrived at by classifying the Poles and Letts as Bolsheviks
and the Bundists as Mensheviks. Let us assume that it is correct to classify the
Bund as Menshevik. But even then it is an obvious and a crying anomaly that the
Menshevik Central Committee should represent the whole of our Party
(the Central Committee consists of seven Mensheviks, three Bolsheviks, one Lett
and two Bundists; one Pole has the rights of a member of the Central Organ;
moreover, on all political questions another five Mensheviks, the editors of the
Central Organ, have the right to speak and vote).


As regards tactics—during the five or six months that have elapsed since
the last Congress the Party has passed through two important periods in our
revolution: the period of the Duma and the “Cabinet of the dissolution of
the Duma”. The Duma tactics of our Central Committee amounted to
supporting the (Cadet) Duma as a whole. These tactics reached their apogee in
the slogan supporting the demand for the appointment of a Duma (i.e., Cadet)
Cabinet. The majority of the Party rejected these tactics and this slogan; that
is a fact. During the Duma period the Social-Democratic Party combated
the tactics of its own Central Committee. Comment on this fact and
discussion of its implications are superfluous.


Further, after the dissolution of the Duma, the Central Committee declared in
favour of organising partial mass expressions of protest. The general tactical
slogan became:

for the Duma as an organ of power which will convene the constituent
assembly. Again, it is an indisputable historical fact that the vast majority of
the Party membership

accept ed 

neither this particular slogan nor the general
tactics of the Central Committee. Yet anyone who carefully reads

    

No. 1 and No. 2 of Sotsial-Demokrat cannot
    fail to see that these general tactics are there defended, justified and
    substantiated (for the Duma as a lever for convening a constituent assembly;
    the Cadets as the urban bourgeoisie which is progressive in comparison
    with the peasantry, and so forth).


Hence it is clear that if there is a new Duma campaign the Party will have to
fight against the Central Committee’s Duma slogans; and if revolutionary actions
take place in the near future, the forces will be split and the struggle will be
disorganised, because the Central Committee does not represent the will of the
majority of the Party membership. Hence, any delay in convening the next Party
Congress not only at present directly contravenes the whole spirit and meaning
of the democratic organisation of the Party, but will also prove a most
dangerous obstacle in the forthcoming Duma and general revolutionary struggle
of the proletariat.



P.S.

Nos. 3 to 5 of Sotsial-Demokrat, which have come out since this
article was written, confirm all that we say even more strongly. It transpires
that on the question of electoral agreements there is a complete split among the
Mensheviks, and their Central Committee is oscillating between Martov and
Cherevanin. Martov has publicly refuted Cherevanin. Plekhanov went off to write
for a Cadet newspaper in order to support Cherevanin. The leading article in
No. 4 of Sotsial-Demokrat proves that the Central Committee is already
preparing once again, in opposition to the Party, to advance its slogans of
supporting the Duma as a whole and of supporting the demand for the appointment
of a Duma Cabinet.

 

Notes
 

[1]

Tovarishch of October 11 gives new figures alleged to have
been obtained from the Central Committee, but which, however, do not in the
main alter the relative proportions. According to these figures our Party
now has about 150,000 members: 33,000 of them are Bolsheviks; 43,000
Mensheviks; 13,000 Letts; 28,000 Poles, and 33,000 members of the Bund.—Lenin
 



[2]

In August 1906 after the failure of the strike decided on
by the Central Committee during the Sveaborg uprising, the St. Petersburg
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. adopted a resolution on the need to convene an
extraordinary Party congress. The St. Petersburg Committee decided to inform the
local organisations of this resolution, asking them to express their opinion on
the matter.


A number of the largest organisations pronounced in favour of convening a
congress, including the Moscow and St. Petersburg committees, the Executive
Committees of the Polish and Lithuanian Social-Democrats, the Regional Bureau
of the Social-Democratic organisations of Central Russia, and the Central
Committee of the Lettish Social-Democrats. The Urals, Nizhny-Novgorod, Bryansk,
Minsk, Kurgan and other committees were also in favour of a congress. The
All-Russian Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. in November decided to convene the
congress on March 15 (28),
1907.

This is an old story: the boycott of the State Duma. A Menshevik comrade writing
in Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 3 (“Situation or Position?”) tells it in
the following way:



“When history presented us with the plan of the Bulygin Duma, we, acting
upon our general principles, recommended the organisation of parallel
unofficial elections to a People’s Duma, in opposition to the Bulygin Duma, to
which we had no access. But when, after the December uprising, we were faced



Stop, my dear historian, one moment! That you skip over the events between the
Bulygin plan and the December uprising is a small matter, merely a chronological
leap. But to do likewise with your tactics and “principles” is
another thing; this leap is—to say the least—diplomatic. Did you
recommend only “unofficial elections”? Did you treat the Bulygin
Duma only as an institution to which you “had no access”? And so,
for the sake of your People’s Duma you in tended to boycott the Bulygin Duma? Or
ignore it? But did you not at that time wage war on certain boycottists? Did you
not insist that an active part should be taken in the “Bulygin”
election campaign which was expected at that time? Did you not demand that the
Party should support the Left liberals at the elections, etc.? How is it that
you have for gotten all that?


“But when, after the December uprising, we were faced....” Stop, you have
omitted another small point. Russia boycott ed the Bulygin Duma, but up to now
there is still no People’s Duma.... Well, have you admitted that your tactics
in those days were mistaken? No, your answer to the boycottists was that your
tactics in regard to the Bulygin Duma were correct, only the revolution
prevented them from being

    

    seen in all their glory.... Now, having recalled all this, continue
    your story.



“But when, after the December uprising, we were faced with the convocation
of the new Witte Duma, we recommended participation in the primary stages of the
elections, counting upon two possibilities: either the very fact of our
participation would evoke a revolutionary upsurge that would sweep away the
Witte Duma....”



Stop, my dear historian, stop, what has come over you?

“The fact of our
participation would evoke a revolutionary upsurge....”

No, really, you must be joking! You have always accused the
Bolsheviks of naïvely exaggerating
our strength—and to think that you should speak seriously of a
revolutionary upsurge—and what an upsurge: one “that would sweep
away”, etc.—which could be evoked by the “fact of our
participation”. No, of course, not seriously.


And so:

“... either the very fact of our participation would evoke a
revolutionary upsurge that would sweep away the Witte Duma and call into being
a representative institution more advantageous to us; or the revolutionary
upsurge would not come immediately, in which case, not only would we be able to
go into the Duma, but the very state of affairs would compel us to do so, as was
the case in Lefortovo District of Moscow.”


Excuse me, but, if I remember rightly, you never said a word about this
“or” at the time.


True, we did not—our historian replies.



“True, in the pamphlet published by the joint editorial board we said that we did
not recommend participation in the elections directly to the Duma. But we did
it, we tied our hands beforehand, only for the sake of a compromise, in the hope
of arriving at some agreement with the boycottists for working out uniform
tactics. This was ’opportunism’ on our part—we deliberately adapted
ourselves to the obsolete, short-sighted views of our boycottist comrades, and
this we sincerely repent.”



So that’s it! You were saying one thing and thinking an other. And you said it
to the proletariat and the whole revolutionary people.... You
“repent” it! But don’t you know the saying: “Caught lying
once, who will trust you again?” What if your “repentance” is also
caused by your “adapting” yourselves to somebody’s
“obsolete” or “short-sighted” views? Where is the limit
to such “opportunism”, to

    

such “compromises”? What should be our attitude to any of your slogans
when you yourselves admit that your slogan on one of the most important tactical
questions was not put forward sincerely? Why, anyone might well believe, after
this, that you call yourselves Social-Democrats only for the sake of
“adapting” yourselves “to the obsolete and short sighted
views” of the revolutionary proletariat.


Well, I must say something in your defence. In the heat of controversy you have
cruelly wronged yourselves. You were sincere boycottists at the third stage of
the elections, just as we were sincere boycottists at all st ages of the
elections. But we were boycottists all together.

Nebst gefangen, nebst gehangen—“caught together, hanged
together”.

You want to
“hang” us now for having been boycottists. But in that case, my dear
comrades, you will have to hang yourselves as well: you have been caught at the
same game. “But we have repented,” you declare. Well, that mitigates your
offence. But it does not acquit you, or exempt you from punishment. Well, not
hanging, but how about a good flogging, for instance? Is that what you are
after?


As for ourselves—we have not repented. We said and still say: boycott or
non-boycott is a question not of principle, but of expediency. The boycott of
the First Duma was expedient. It gave the mass of the people a vivid, concrete,
proletarian appraisal of the Duma as an institution incapable of solving the
fundamental problems of the revolution. The dissolution of the Duma and all that
followed it have confirmed this appraisal; the mass of the people clearly
perceives that here, too, the proletariat proved to be their natural leader in
the revolution, warning them beforehand of the sterility of constitutional
illusions! The boycott diverted the attention and the forces of the government,
and thus contributed to the victory of the bourgeois opposition at the
elections. The boycott united the broad proletarian masses in a single act of
revolutionary protest. Its agitational and organisational effect was enormous.


The boycott performed a great service—but its work is already
done. A proper appraisal of the Duma was given, a telling blow was struck at
parliamentary illusions—there is no need to do it over again. At the
present time a boycott will not divert the forces of the government—the
latter has

    

      certainly learned the lesson of the past elections. The work of agitation and
      organisation can be performed just as well by taking part in elections as
      by boycotting them—unless the electoral law is changed very much for
      the worse. If it is, then, perhaps, we may have to resort to the boycott
      again. But we may not have time to bother with Duma elections
      at all if big revolutionary battles begin again.


Thus, boycotting remains a question of expediency. The only point is that
for the time being we do not see sufficient grounds for a boycott.


Whoever feels guilty, let him repent; but in doing so, let him strew ashes on
his own head and let him rend his own garments, not other
people’s. And one should not distort history and commit libel in a fit of
repentance—not even against oneself.

The above-mentioned article was already written when
G. V. Plekhanov’s “Open Letter to Class-Conscious
Workers” appeared in the newspaper Tovarishch. In that letter
Plekhanov, “manoeuvring” between the Left wing of the bourgeoisie
and the Bight wing of the Social-Democrats, finally breaks both with the
principles of international revolutionary Social-Democracy and with the
decisions of the Unity Congress of our Party. The Party Congress formally
forbade all blocs whatsoever with bourgeois parties. The class-conscious,
organised proletarian at his Party meetings calls all blocs with the bourgeoisie
“betrayal of the cause of the proletariat”; in his article in
Tovarishch and in his letter to the Party organisations, L. Martov,
adopting the Bolshevik, i.e., the consistent revolutionary standpoint,
emphatically expresses his opposition to all blocs at the first stage of the
elections. “On the first question [“blocs” or electoral
pacts],” writes Martov, “I would recommend that we insist, in
conformity with the resolution of the Congress, upon complete independence
during our participation in the first stage of the elections, i.e., at
the stage when we come before the masses.” Plekhanov regards this method of
presenting the question as “misconceived hostility to
compromise”. “Where we cannot be sure of the victory of our
candidate,” writes Plekhanov, “it is our duty to enter into an
agreement with other parties who wish to fight against our old

    regime.”[1]

While thus sanctioning agreements

    

    with bourgeois parties in spite of the decision of the Congress, Plekhanov,
    however, displays his “political sagacity” by foreseeing cases
    when we should not enter into such agreements. He writes: “Where
    there is no doubt that we shall succeed in getting our candidate

     elected[2]

    we can and must act independently of the other
    parties.” What a wonderful piece of “political sagacity”! Where we are
    sure of getting our candidate elected ourselves we must do it
    ourselves. Where we are not sure, we must apply for assistance ... to
    those “who wish to fight against the old regime”, or else he] p
    these “wishers” to get their candidate elected. And where those
    “who wish to fight” are sure of getting their candidates elected
    themselves, what do you think, 0 contributor to the Cadet press, Plekhanov,
    will they be so anxious to conclude an agreement with us? Indeed, if we are
    talking about agreements, every political infant is aware that they are
    required only in cases where a party is not sure of getting its candidates
    elected by its own unaided efforts. We, however, are opposed to all
    agreements even under such circumstances. But G. V. Plekhanov, like a true
    knight of freedom, sounds the tocsin in the Cadet Tovarishch and
    calls together all those “who wish to fight”.... Come, all ye
    “wishers”! The proletariat is fighting, you— “wish”
    to fight! Excellent.... If that is not enough for a proletarian, he must
    assuredly be an “enemy of freedom”.


Thus, the leader of the Mensheviks, the darling of the Cadets, forgetting all
that he said after the dissolution of the Duma, is little by little, step by
step, sinking to the level of ... Cherevanin.... With his usual
“swiftness, dash and unerring eye” Plekhanov is rushing to the
extreme right of our Right wing. Martov is left far behind;
Sotsial-Demokrat can hardly keep pace with its ideological
leader. And the organ of the
Central Committee, after a long-winded argument about the class character of
our election campaign, proposes an intricate system of agreements, building a
ladder by which Social-Democrats should descend to the level of the Cadets. At
first, suggests Sotsial-Demokrat, independent, i.e., class action
where we have chances of success; where there are no chances of success, we must
combine with

    

the bourgeois parties which “are striving with us for the convocation of a
constituent assembly”; if these parties do not want the constituent
assembly—so much the worse (this is the third, last, anti-class and
anti-democratic step)— we shall combine with them nevertheless. How the
Central Committee, which was elected by the Congress to carry out the decisions
of the Congress, contrives to act in violation of these decisions is a secret
known only to itself. The fact remains that at the present moment we are
witnessing the very disgraceful (for Social-Democracy) spectacle of “the
crab crawling backwards” and the “swan straining skyward” on
the editorial board of the leading, central organ, when on a question of such
import to us as electoral tactics there is neither unity of thought nor unity of
action, not only in the Party as a whole, but even in the “leading”
faction in that Party. What country and what Socialist Party, except, perhaps,
the most opportunist, would tolerate such political depravity? And the
remarkable fact is that it is these crabs, pikes and swans, these two squabblers
Martov and Plekhanov, who are conducting a desperate campaign against the
convocation of an extraordinary congress of the Party, one which we now need more
than ever.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

 

    The election campaign for the Second Duma is now a subject of great
    interest in the workers’ party. Special attention is being devoted to the
    question of “blocs”, i.e., permanent or temporary electoral
    agreements between the Social-Democrats and other parties. The bourgeois,
    Cadet press— Rech, Tovarishch, Novy Put, Oko,
    etc.—are doing their utmost to convince the workers of the need for a
    “bloc” (an electoral agreement) between the Social-Democrats and
    the Cadets. Some Menshevik Social-Democrats are also advocating such blocs
    (Cherevanin in Nashe Dyelo and Tovarishch), others are
    opposed to them (Martov in Tovarishch). The Bolshevik
    Social-Democrats are opposed to such blocs, and agree only to partial
    agreements at the higher stages of the election campaign on the distribution
    of seats in proportion to the polling strength of the revolutionary and
    opposition parties at the primary ballot.


We shall try to state briefly the case for this last standpoint.

I

Social-Democrats regard parliamentarism (participation in representative
assemblies) as one of the means of enlightening and educating the proletariat
and organising it in an independent class party; as one of the methods of the
political struggle for the emancipation of the workers. This Marxist standpoint
radically distinguishes Social-Democracy from bourgeois democracy, on the one
hand, and from anarchism on the other. Bourgeois liberals and radicals regard
parliamentarism as the “natural” and the only normal and legitimate
method of conducting state affairs in general,

    

      and they repudiate the class struggle and the class character of modern
      parliamentarism. The bourgeoisie exerts every effort, by every possible
      means and on every possible occasion, to put blinkers on the eyes of the
      workers to prevent them from seeing that parliamentarism is an instrument
      of bourgeois oppression, to prevent them from realising the historically
      limited importance of parliamentarism. The anarchists are also unable to
      appreciate the historically defined importance of parliamentarism and
      entirely renounce this method of struggle. That is why the
      Social-Democrats in Russia strenuously combat both anarchism and the
      efforts of the bourgeoisie to stop the revolution as soon as
    possible by coming to terms with the old regime on a parliamentary
    basis. They subordinate their parliamentary activities entirely and
    absolutely to the general interests of the working-class movement and to
    the special tasks of the proletariat in the present bourgeois-democratic
    revolution.


Hence it follows, firstly, that the participation of the Social-Democrats in the
Duma campaign is of a quite different nature from that of other parties. Unlike
them, we do not regard this campaign as an end in itself or even as being of
cardinal importance. Unlike them, we subordinate this campaign to the interests
of the class struggle. Unlike them, the slogan we put forward in this campaign
is not parliamentarism for the sake of parliamentary reforms, but the
revolutionary struggle for a constituent assembly. More over, we wage this
struggle in its highest forms, which have arisen from the historical development
of the forms of struggle during the last few

years.[1]

    

     

Notes
 

[1]

We shall not here touch on the question of boycott, as this does not
come within the scope of this pamphlet. We shall only remark that this
question cannot be properly appraised apart from the concrete
historical situation. The boycott of the Bulygin Duma was
successful. The boycott of the Witte Duma was necessary and
correct. The revolutionary Social-Democrats must be the
first to take the line of the most resolute, the most direct struggle,
and must be the last to adopt more circuitous methods of
struggle. The Stolypin Duma cannot he boycotted in the old way, and it
would be wrong to do so after the experience of the First Duma.—Lenin

Lenin: 1906/eleagree: II







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

II

What conclusion follows from the foregoing in regard to electoral agreements?
First of all, that our basic, main task is to develop the class-consciousness
and independent class organisation of the proletariat, as the only class that
remains revolutionary to the end, as the only possible leader of a victorious
bourgeois-democratic revolution. Therefore, class independence throughout the
election and Duma campaigns is our most important general task. This does not
exclude other, partial tasks, but the latter must always be subordinate to and
in conformity with it. This general premise, which is confirmed by the theory of
Marxism and the whole experience of the international Social-Democratic
movement, must be our point of departure.


The special tasks of the proletariat in the Russian revolution may seem at once
to controvert this general premise on the following grounds: the big bourgeoisie
has already betrayed the revolution through the Octobrists, or has made it its
aim to put a stop to the revolution by means of a constitution (the Cadets);
the victory of the revolution is possible only if the proletariat is supported
by the most progressive and politically conscious section of the peasantry,
whose objective position impels it to fight and not to compromise, to carry
through and not to curb the revolution. Hence, some may conclude, the
Social-Democrats must enter into agreements with the democratic peasantry for
the whole duration of the elections.


But such a conclusion cannot be drawn from the absolutely correct premise that
the complete victory of our revolution is possible only in the form of a
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. It
has yet to be proved that a bloc with the democratic peasantry for the whole
duration of the elections is possible and advantageous from the point of view of
present party relationships (the democratic peasantry in our country is now
represented not by one, but by various parties) and from the point of view of
the present electoral system. It has yet to be proved that by forming a bloc
with this or that party we shall express and uphold the interests of the truly
revolutionary sections of the peasantry better than by preserving

    

the complete independence of our Party in criticising such-and-such
    democratic peasant parties, and in counterposing some elements of
    the democratic peasantry to others. The premise that the proletariat is
    closest to the revolutionary peasantry in the present revolution undoubtedly
    leads to the general political “line” of Social-Democracy:
    together with the democratic peasantry against the treacherous
    big-bourgeois “democrats” (the Cadets). But whether it leads to the
    formation at the present time of an election bloc with the Popular
    Socialists (Popular Socialist Party), or the Socialist-Revolutionaries
    cannot lie decided without an analysis of the features which distinguish
    these parties from each other and from the Cadets, without an
    analysis of the present electoral system with its numerous
    stages. Only one thing follows from it, directly and absolutely:
    under no circumstances can we during our election campaign confine
    ourselves to baldly and abstractly counterposing the proletariat to the
    bourgeois democrats in general. On the contrary, we must devote our whole
    attention to drawing a precise distinction, based on the historical
      facts of our revolution, between the liberal-monarchist and
    the revolutionary-democratic bourgeoisie, or, to put it more concretely, to
    the distinction between the Cadets, Popular Socialists, and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. Only by drawing such a distinction shall we be
    able to determine most correctly who our closest “allies”
    are. But, firstly, we shall not forget that the Social-Democrats must watch
    every ally from the bourgeois democrats as they would an
    enemy. Secondly, we shall examine very carefully to see which is most
    advantageous: to tie our hands in a general bloc with some Popular
    Socialists (for instance), or to preserve complete independence so as to be
    quite free at the decisive moment to split the non-party
    “Trudoviks” into opportunists (P. S.’s) and revolutionaries
    (S.-R.’s), to counterpose the latter to the former, etc.


Thus, the argument about the proletarian-peasant character of our revolution
does not entitle us to conclude that we must enter into agreements with this or
that democratic peas ant party at this or that stage of the elections to the
Second Duma. It is not even a sufficient argument for limiting the class
independence of the proletariat during the elections, let alone for renouncing
this independence.

Lenin: 1906/eleagree: III







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

III

In order to come nearer to the solution of our problem we must, firstly, examine
the fundamental party groupings in the elections to the Second Duma and,
secondly, examine the specific features of the present electoral system.


Electoral agreements are concluded between parties. What are the main types of
parties that will contest the elections? The Black Hundreds will no doubt unite
even more closely than during the elections to the First Duma. The Octobrists
and the Party of Peaceful Renovation will join either the Black Hundreds or the
Cadets, or, more probably, will oscillate between the two. In any case, to
regard the Octobrists as a “party of the Centre” (as L. Martov does
in his latest pamphlet, Political Parties in Russia) is a fundamental
error: in the actual struggle which must finally decide the outcome of
our revolution, the Cadets form the Centre. The Cadets are an
organised party that is going into the elections independently and, moreover, is
intoxicated with its success at the First Duma elections. But the discipline of
this party is not of the strictest and its solidarity not of the strong est. The
Left-wing Cadets are disgruntled about the defeat at
Helsingfors[1]

and are protesting. Some of them (Mr. Alexinsky in Moscow, recently) are
going over to the Popular Socialists. In the First Duma there were some
“exceptionally rare” Cadets who even gave their signatures to the
Bill of the "33" for the abolition of all private ownership of land
(Badamshin, Zubchenko and Lozhkin). Hence, to split off at least a small section
from this “Centre” and bring it towards the Left is not a hopeless
proposition. The Cadets are only too conscious of their weakness among the mass
of the people (quite recently even the Cadet Tovarishch had to admit
this), and they would readily agree to a bloc with the Lefts. It is not for
nothing that the Cadet newspapers have with such tender joy opened their columns
to the Social-Democrats Martov and Cherevanin to discuss the question of a
bloc between the Social-Democrats and the Cadets. We, of course, will never
forget, and will tell it to the masses during the election campaign, that the
Cadets failed to keep their promises in the First Duma, that they obstructed the
Trudoviks, played at making constitutions, etc., etc., going

    

to the extent of keeping silent about the “four
points”,[2]

the Draconian Bills, and so forth.


Next come the “Trudoviks”. The parties of this type, namely the
petty-bourgeois and predominantly peasant par ties, are divided into the
non-party “Trudovik Group” (which held a congress
recently), the Popular Socialists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries (the Polish
Socialist Party, etc., correspond more or less to the
Socialist-Revolutionaries). The only more or less consistent and determined
revolutionaries and republicans among them are the S.-R.’s. The Popular
Socialists are much worse opportunists than our Mensheviks; strictly speaking,
they are semi-Cadets. The non-party “Trudovik Group” has, perhaps,
more influence among the peasantry than the others; but the strength of its
democratic convictions is difficult to determine, although it is undoubtedly far
more Left than the Cadets, and evidently belongs to the camp of revolutionary
democracy.


The Social-Democratic Party is the only party which, in spite of internal
dissensions, will enter the elections as a thoroughly disciplined body, which has
a fully definite and strictly class basis, and which has united all the Social-
Democratic parties of all the nationalities in Russia.


But how are we to enter into a general bloc with the Trudoviks, considering the
composition of this type of party, as outlined above? What sureties
have we for the non-party Trudoviks? Is a bloc possible between party
and non-party people? How do we know that Alexinsky & Co. will not,
tomorrow, turn from the Popular Socialists back to the Cadets?


It is clear that a real party agreement with the Trudoviks is
impossible. It is clear that we must not under any circumstances help
to unite the opportunist Popular Socialists with the revolutionary S.-R.’s; on
the contrary, we must split them and counterpose one to the other. It is clear
that the existence of a non-party Trudovik Group makes it more to our advantage
in all respects to preserve complete independence in order to exert a really
revolutionary influence upon them than to tie our hands and blur the
distinctions between the monarchists and the republicans, etc. It is
absolutely impermissible for Social-Democrats to blur these
distinctions; and for this reason alone it is necessary to reject blocs altogether,

    

once the present grouping of parties unites the non-party
Trudoviks, the Popular Socialists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries.


Can they really unite, and are they doing so? They certainly can unite, for
they have the same petty-bourgeois class basis. They were, in fact, united in
the First Duma, in the press during the October period, in the press of the Duma
period, and in the ballots among the students

(si licet parva componere magnis—if the small may be
compared with the great).

A minor symptom,
but a characteristic one when connected with others, is the fact that in the
ballots of the “autonomous” students there were often three
conflicting lists: the Cadets, the bloc of the Trudoviks, Popular Socialists,
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Polish Socialist Party, and, lastly, the
Social-Democrats.


From the point of view of the proletariat, clarity as regards the class
grouping of the parties is of supreme importance; and the advantage of
independently influencing the non-party Trudoviks (or those who are oscillating
between the Popular Socialists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries) is obvious
compared with attempts by the Party to reach an agreement with the non-party
people. The facts relating to the parties compel the following
conclusion: no agreements whatsoever at the lower stage, when agitation is
carried on among the masses; at the higher stages all efforts must be directed
towards defeating the Cadets during the distribution of seats by means of a
partial agreement between the Social-Democrats and Trudoviks, and towards
defeating the Popular Socialists by means of a partial agreement between the
Social-Democrats and the Socialist-Revolutionaries.


The objection will be raised: while you incorrigibly utopian Bolsheviks are
dreaming of defeating the Cadets, you will all be defeated by the Black
Hundreds, because you will split the vote! The Social-Democrats, the
Trudoviks and the Cadets together would rout the Black Hundreds for certain; but
by acting separately, you may present the common enemy with an easy victory. Let
us assume that the Black Hundreds get 26 per cent of the votes, the Trudoviks
and Cadets 25 per cent each, and the Social-Democrats 24 per cent. The Black
Hundreds will get in unless the Social Democrats, the Trudoviks and the Cadets
form a bloc.

 

This objection is often taken seriously, and so we must carefully analyse
      it. But in order to analyse it, we must examine the given, i.e.,
    the present electoral system in Russia.

Lenin is referring to the decisions of the Fourth Congress
of the Cadet Party, held September 24-28 (October 7-11), 1906, in
Helsingfors. In the debate on tactics the Central Committee of that Party moved a
resolution rejecting the “passive resistance” proclaimed in the
Vyborg Manifesto (see Note 48). The Left Cadets (mainly representatives of
provincial organisations of the Party) moved their own resolution, in which
“passive resistance” was acknowledged to be the immediate task of
the Party. By a majority of votes the Congress adopted the Central Committee’s
resolution which called for the Vyborg Manifesto not to be put into
effect.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

IV

Our Duma elections are not direct, but multiple-stage elections. In
multiple-stage elections the splitting of votes is dangerous only at the lower
stage. It is only when the primary voters go to the poll that the division of
the votes is an unknown quantity; it is only in our agitation among the masses
that we have to work “in the dark”. At the higher stages, when the
elected representatives vote, the general engagement is over; all that remains
is to distribute the seats by partial agreements among the parties, which
know the exact number of their candidates and their votes.


The lowest stage in the elections is the election of electors in the cities, the
election of representatives—one per ten households—-in the villages,
and the election of delegates to the workers’ curia.


In the cities, in every electoral area (ward, etc.), we face a great mass of
voters. There is, undoubtedly, a danger of splitting the vote. It cannot be
denied that in the cities Black-Hundred electors may be elected in some places
exclusively because of the absence of a “bloc of the
Lefts”, exclusively because, let us say, the Social-Democrats may divert
part of the votes from the Cadets. It will be recalled that in Moscow Guchkov
received something like 900 votes, and the Cadets about 1,400. If a
Social-Democrat had taken 501 votes from the Cadet, Guchkov would have won. And
there is no doubt that the general public will take this simple calculation into
account; they will be afraid of splitting the vote, and because of that will be
inclined to cast their votes only for the most moderate of the opposition
candidates. We shall have what is called in England a
“three-cornered” fight, when the urban petty bourgeoisie are afraid
to vote for a socialist candidate because it would take votes from the liberal
and thus allow the conservative to win.


How can this danger be averted? There is only one way:

to conclude an agreement at the lower stage, that is, put up

    

a joint list of electors in which the number of candidates of each
party is determined by a definite agreement of the par ties before the
contest. All the parties entering into the agreement call upon the
electorate to vote for this joint list.


Let us examine the arguments for and against this method. The arguments for are
as follows: agitation can be conducted upon strictly party lines. Let the
Social-Democrats criticise the Cadets before the masses as much as they like,
but let them add: yet they are better than the Black Hundreds, and therefore we
have agreed upon a joint list.


The arguments against are as follows: a joint list would be in crying
contradiction to the whole independent class policy of the Social-Democratic
Party. By recommending a joint list of Cadets and Social-Democrats to the masses
we would be bound to cause hopeless confusion of class and political
divisions. We would undermine the principles and the general revolutionary
significance of our campaign for the sake of gaining a seat in the Duma for a
liberal! We would
be subordinating class policy to parliamentarism instead of subordinating
parliamentarism to class policy. We would deprive ourselves of the opportunity
to gain an estimate of our forces. We would lose what is lasting and
durable in all elections—the development of the class-consciousness and
solidarity of the socialist proletariat. We would gain what is transient,
relative and untrue—superiority of the Cadet over the Octobrist.


Why should we jeopardise our consistent work of socialist education? Because of
the danger of Black-Hundred candidates? But all the cities in Russia combined
have only 35 of the 524 seats in the Duma (St. Petersburg 6, Moscow 4, Warsaw
and Tashkent 2 each, the other 21 cities 1 each). This means that the cities by
themselves cannot under any circumstances materially affect the composition of
the Duma. Besides, we cannot confine ourselves to the merely formal
consideration of the arithmetical possibility of splitting the votes. We must
ascertain whether there is any great political probability of this
happening. An analysis shows that the Black Hundreds obtained a very small
minority even in the elections to the First Duma, that cases like the
“Guchkov” case mentioned above were exceptional. According
to statistics in Vestnik Kadetskoi Partii[2]

(No. 7, April 19,

    

1906), in 20 cities, which sent 28 deputies to the Duma— out of 1,761
     electors 1,468 were Cadets, 32 Progressists, 25 non-party, 128 Octobrists,
     32 of the Commercial and Industrial Party, and 76 of the Right, i.e.,
     total Rights 236, less than 15 per cent. In ten cities not a
     single elector of the Rights was returned; in three cities not more
     than ten electors (out of eighty) of the Rights were returned in each of
     them. Is it reasonable, under such circumstances, to give up the struggle
     for our own class candidates because of an exaggerated fear of the Black
     Hundreds? Would not such a policy, even from a narrow, practical point of
     view, betray short-sightedness, not to speak of instability of principles?


And what about a bloc with the Trudoviks against the Cadets? we shall be
asked. But we have already pointed out the special features of the party
relations among the Trudoviks, which make such a bloc undesirable and
inexpedient. In the cities, where the working-class population is
mostly concentrated, we must never, except in case of extreme
necessity, refrain from putting up absolutely independent Social-Democratic
candidates. And there is no such urgent necessity. A few Cadets or Trudoviks
more or less (especially of the Popular-Socialist type!) are of no serious
political importance, for the Duma itself can, at best, play only a subsidiary,
secondary role. It is the peasantry, the gubernia assemblies of electors, that
are of decisive political importance in determining the results of the Duma
elections, and not the

       cities.[1]

In the gubernia assemblies of electors, however,
we shall achieve our general political alliance with the Trudoviks against the
Cadets far better and more certainly,

    

without in the least infringing our strict principles, than at the lower
stage of the elections in the countryside. We shall now discuss the elections in
the countryside.

 

Notes
 

[1]

The small towns, of course, also affect the composition of the gubernia
electoral assemblies, through the town conferences. Here, too, the Cadets
and the Progressists have had a great majority of votes: for instance, out
of 571. electors elected by town conferences, 424 were Cadets and
Progressists and 147 of the Right (Vestnik Kadetskoi Partii,
No. 5, March 28, 1906). The figures for the separate towns fluctuate very
considerably, of course. Under such circumstances we could probably, in
very many cases, have put up an independent fight against the Cadets
without fearing any accidental splitting of the votes, and without making
ourselves dependent upon any non-Social-Democratic party. As for blocs at
the lowest stage of elections in the workers’ curia, probably not a single
Social-Democrat will speak of them seriously. Complete independence of the
Social-Democrats is particularly necessary among the working-class
masses—Lenin

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

V

In the big cities, as is well known, there were cases where the state of
organisation of the political parties swept away one stage of the elections. By
law the elections consisted of two stages. In practice, however, the elections
sometimes proved to be direct, or almost direct, as the electorate definitely
knew the character of the contending parties, and in some cases they even knew
the persons whom a given party intended to send into the Duma. In the
countryside, on the contrary, there are so many stages, the electorate is so
scattered, and the obstacles to open party action are so great that the
elections to the First Duma were, and those to the Second Duma will be,
conducted very much “under a cloak”. In other words, very often, and
even in the majority of cases, party propagandists will speak to the electors on
par ties in general, deliberately mentioning no names out of fear of
the police. The radical and revolutionary peasants (and not only peasants) will
deliberately screen themselves behind the title “non-party”. At the
election of one delegate per ten households it is knowledge of the person as
such, personal confidence in this or that candidate, sympathy with his
Social-Democratic speeches that will decide the issue. Here the number of
Social-Democrats backed by a local Party organisation will be very
small. But the number of Social-Democrats who win the sympathies of the local
rural population may prove to be much larger than might be expected from the
number of local Party units in those districts.


Petty-bourgeois romanticists like the Popular Socialists, who are dreaming of a
legal Socialist Party under the existing order, do not understand how confidence
in and sympathy with the underground party are growing because of its
consistent, uncompromising, militant spirit and the elusiveness of its
organisation, which influences the masses not through Party men alone. A real
revolutionary illegal party, steeled

    

in battle, accustomed to the Plehves, and undismayed by the stern measures of
      the Stolypins, may, in the period of civil war, be capable of influencing
      the masses to a greater extent than any legal party which, with
      “callow simplicity”, takes a “strictly constitutional
      path”.


The Social-Democrats who are members of the Party, and Social-Democrats who do
not belong to it, will have good chances of success at the elections of the
one-per-ten-house hold representatives and the delegates. A bloc with the
Trudoviks, or a joint list, is not at all important for success at this stage of
the election in the countryside. On the one hand, the electoral units are quite
small there, and on the other, real party Trudoviks, or such as at all resemble
them, will be quite rare. The strict Party spirit of the Social-Democrats,
their unconditional submission to the Party which has been able to exist
illegally for many years and has reached a membership of 100,000 to 150,000 of
all nationalities, the only Party on the extreme Left which formed a Party Group
in the First Duma—this Party spirit will be a powerful recommendation and
guarantee for all those who are not afraid of a resolute struggle and wish for
it whole-heartedly, but do not altogether trust their own strength, are afraid
of taking the initiative and are afraid to come out openly. We must utilise this
advantage of being a strict, “illegal” party to the utmost, and we
have nothing to gain by weakening it even slightly by any kind of permanent
bloc. The only other resolute and determinedly revolutionary party likely to
compete with us are the Socialist-Revolutionaries. But a bloc with them on a
really party basis at the first stage of the rural elections would be
possible only as an exception: one has only to picture to oneself clearly what
the actual election conditions are like in the country side to become convinced
of

this.[1]

Insofar as the non-party revolutionary peasants will be active, while
deliberately refraining from associating with any one party, it will be more to
our advantage in all respects to influence them in

    

the sense we desire along strictly party lines. The non-party character of the
association, of the agitation, need not hamper the party Social-Democrat, for
the revolutionary peasants will never wish to exclude him; and his
participation in a non-party revolutionary association is especially sanctioned
by the resolution of the Unity Congress on supporting the peasant movement.Thus,
while preserving and upholding our Party principle, utilising fully its enormous
moral and political advantages, we can at the same time fully adapt ourselves to
the task of working among the non-party revolutionary peasants, in the non-party
revolutionary associations, circles and meetings, of working with the aid of
our non-party revolutionary connections, and so forth. Instead of forming a bloc
with the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who have succeeded in organising only a very
small fraction of the revolutionary peasantry—a bloc that would restrict
and cramp our strict Party principle—we shall make wider and freer use of
our Party position and of all the advantages of working among the non-party
“Trudoviks”.


The conclusion to be drawn is that at the lower stages of the election campaign
in the countryside, that is, at the election of the one-per-ten-household
representatives and of the delegates (sometimes the election of the delegates
will, in practice, probably be tantamount to a first stage election),
there is no need for us to enter into any electoral agreements. The
percentage of men with definite political views who are suitable as candidates
for the office of one-per-ten-household representatives, or delegates, is so
small that the Social-Democrats who have gained the confidence and respect of
the peasants (and without this condition no serious candidature is conceivable)
have every chance, almost to a man, of being elected as
one-per-ten-household representatives and delegates, without having to enter
into any agreement with other parties.


As for the assemblies of delegates, there we shall be able to base our policy
upon the exact results of the primary election contests which have decided the
whole matter in advance. Here we can and must enter into—not blocs, of
course, not close and permanent agreements—but partial agreements on the
distribution of seats. Here, and even more so on the assemblies of electors for
the election of the Duma deputies,

    

we must, in conjunction with the Trudoviks, defeat the Cadets, and in
      conjunction with the Socialist-Revolutionaries, defeat the Popular
      Socialists, etc.

 

Notes
 

[1]

It was certainly no accident that the Socialist-Revolutionaries could
not come forward as a party in the First Duma; could not rather than would
not. The Socialist-Revolutionaries in the Duma, as well as those in the
University, thought it more advantageous to hide behind the
non-party Trudoviks, or to enter into a bloc with them.—Lenin

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

VI

Thus, an examination of the actual electoral system shows that blocs at the
lower stages of the elections are particularly undesirable in the cities, and
are not essential. In the countryside, at the lower stages (i.e., at the
election of the one- per-ten-household representatives and of the delegates),
blocs are both undesirable and quite unnecessary. The uyezd assemblies of
delegates and the gubernia assemblies of electors are of decisive political
importance. Here, i.e., at the higher stages, partial agreements are necessary
and possible without undesirable infringement of party principle; for the
contest before the masses has ended, and there is no need to advocate before the
masses directly or indirectly (or even by assumption) a non-party policy; neither
is there the least danger of obscuring the strictly independent class policy of
the

     proletariat.[1]


Now let us examine, first from the formal, arithmetical point of view, so to
speak, what forms these partial electoral agreements will assume at the higher
stages.


We shall take approximate percentages, i.e., the distribution of electors (and
delegates, who are included in what follows) according to party, per hundred
electors. To succeed in an assembly of electors a candidate must obtain at least
51 votes out of every 100. This indicates that the general tactical rule of the
Social-Democratic electors must be: to

    

try to win over a sufficient number of bourgeois-democratic electors who
sympathise with Social-Democracy, or such as most deserve support, in order
jointly with them to defeat the rest and thus secure the election of in part
Social-Democratic and in part the best bourgeois-democratic

      electors.[2]


We shall illustrate this rule by simple examples. Let us assume that out of 100
electors, 49 are Black Hundreds, 40 are Cadets and 11 are Social-Democrats. A
partial agreement between the Social-Democrats and the Cadets is necessary in
order to secure the election in full of a joint list of Duma candidates, on the
basis, of course, of a proportional distribution of Duma seats according to the
number of electors (i.e., in this case, one-fifth of the Duma seats from the
whole gubernia, say, two out of ten, would go to the Social-Democrats, and
four-fifths, or eight out of ten, would go to the Cadets). If there are 49
Cadets, 40 Trudoviks and 11 Social-Democrats, we must try to reach an agreement
with the Trudoviks so as to defeat the Cadets and to win one-fifth of the seats
for ourselves and four-fifths for the Trudoviks. In such a case we would have a
splendid opportunity to test the consistency and steadfastness of the democratic
convictions of the Trudoviks: would they agree to turn away from the Cadets
entirely and defeat them in conjunction with the electors of the workers’ party,
or would they rather choose to “save” this or that Cadet or,
perhaps, even prefer a bloc with the Cadets to one with the Social-Democrats?
Here we can, and must, demonstrate and prove to the whole people to what extent
particular petty-bourgeois elements are gravitating towards the monarchist
bourgeoisie or towards the revolutionary proletariat.


In the last example the Trudoviks stand to gain an obvious advantage by forming
a bloc with the Social-Democrats and not with the Cadets, for in the former
case they

    

would obtain four-fifths of the total number of seats, whereas in the
latter case they would obtain only four-ninths. Still more interesting
would be the reverse case: 11 Cadets, 40 Trudoviks and 49
Social-Democrats. In such a case the prospect of an obvious advantage would
impel the Trudoviks t.o enter into a bloc with the Cadets: in that case
“we” shall get more seats in the Duma, they will say. But loyalty to the
principles of democracy and to he interests of the real working masses
would certainly call for a bloc with the Social-Democrats, even at the cost
of some seats in the Duma. The representatives of the proletariat must
carefully take all such cases into account and explain to the electors and
to the whole people (the results of agreements in the assemblies of
delegates and electors must be publicly announced) the significance from
the point of view of principle of this election arithmetic.  

Further, in the last example we see a case where both the prospect of
obvious advantage and considerations of principle are inducements to the
Social-Democrats to split the Trudoviks. If among them there are, say, two
fully party Socialist-Revolutionaries, we must exert every effort to win
them to our side and with 51 votes defeat all the Cadets and all the rest
of the less revolutionary Trudoviks. If among the Trudoviks there
are two Socialist-Revolutionaries and 38 Popular Socialists, we shall have
an opportunity to test the loyalty of the Socialist-Revolutionaries to the
interests of democracy and to the interests of the working masses. We would
say: vote for the republican democrats and against the Popular Socialists,
who tolerate the monarchy; vote for the confiscation of the landlords’ land
and against the Popular Socialists, who tolerate redemption payments; vote
for those who are for arming the whole people and against the Popular
Socialists, who accept a standing army. And then we would see whom the
Socialist-Revolutionaries would prefer—the

    Social-Cadets[3]

or the Social-Democrats.  
 

This brings us to the question of the significance of this election
arithmetic from the point of view of political principle. Our duty here is
to oppose seat-hunting and to put forward an absolutely firm and consistent
defence of the standpoint of the socialist proletariat and of the interests
of the complete victory of our bourgeois-democratic revolution. Under no
circumstances, and in no way, should our Social-Democratic delegates and
electors keep silent about our socialist aims, our strictly class
position as a proletarian party. But a mere repetition of the word
“class” is not sufficient to indicate the role of the proletariat as the
vanguard in the present revolution. Expounding our socialist
doctrine and the general theory of Marxism is not sufficient to prove the
leading role of the proletariat. This requires, in addition, the ability to
show in practice, in analysing the burning questions of the
present revolution, that the members of the workers’ party are
more consistent, more unerring, more determined and more skilful than all
others in defending the interests of this revolution, the cause of
its complete victory. This is no easy task, and the fundamental
and chief duty of every Social-Democrat who is entering the election
campaign is to prepare for it.  

To determine the differences between the parties and shades of parties
at the assemblies of delegates and of electors (as well as throughout the
election campaign—that goes without saying) will be a small, but useful
practical task. In this matter, incidentally, the course of events will
settle many controversial questions which are agitating the members of the
Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Right wing of the Party, from the
extreme opportunists of Nashe Dyelo to the moderate opportunists
of Sotsial-Demokrat, are doing their utmost to obliterate and
distort the difference between the Trudoviks and the Cadets, evidently
failing to notice a new and very important phenomenon, namely, the division
of the Trudoviks into Popular Socialists, Socialist Revolutionaries, and
those who are gravitating to the one or the other. Of course, the history
of the First Duma and its dissolution already provided documentary evidence
making the drawing of a distinction between the Cadets and the Trudoviks
absolutely imperative and proving that the latter are more consistently and
staunchly democratic than the

    

    former. The election campaign to the Second Duma must prove and show this even
    more graphically, more exactly, more fully, and more widely. As we have
    tried to show by examples, the election campaign itself will
    teach the Social-Democrats to distinguish correctly between
    the various bourgeois-democratic parties and will refute, or, more
    correctly, sweep aside, the deeply mistaken opinion that the Cadets are the
    chief or, at any rate, important representatives of our bourgeois democracy
    in general.


Let us point out, too, that in the election campaign in general, and in
concluding electoral agreements at the higher stages, the Social-Democrats must
speak simply and clearly, in a language comprehensible to the masses, absolutely
discarding the heavy artillery of erudite terms, foreign words and stock
slogans, definitions and conclusion which are as yet unfamiliar and
unintelligible to the masses. Without flamboyant phrases, without rhetoric, but
with facts and figures, they must be able to explain the questions of
social ism and of the present Russian revolution.


Two fundamental questions of this revolution, the questions of freedom and of
land, will inevitably arise here. Upon these fundamental questions which are
agitating the vast mass of the people we must concentrate both purely socialist
propaganda—the difference between the standpoint of the small proprietor
and that of the proletariat—and the distinction between the parties
fighting for influence over the people. The Black Hundreds, right up to the
Octobrists inclusively, are against freedom, against giving the land to the
people. They want to stop the revolution by force, bribery and
deceit. The liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, the Cadets, are also
striving to stop the revolution, but by means of a number of
concessions. They do not want to give the people either complete
freedom, or all the land. They want to preserve landlordism by means of
redemption payments and local land committees not elected on the basis of
universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot. The Trudoviks, i.e., the petty
bourgeoisie, especially the rural petty bourgeoisie, are striving to secure all
the land and complete freedom, but are pursuing this aim hesitatingly, not
consciously, timidly, vacillating between the opportunism of the Social-Cadets (the
Popular Socialists)—who justify the hegemony

    

of the liberal bourgeoisie over the peasantry and elevate it to a
theory—and utopian equality, alleged to be possible under commodity
production. Social-Democracy must consistently uphold the standpoint of the
proletariat and purge the revolutionary consciousness of the peasantry
of Popular-Socialist opportunism and of utopianism, which obscure the really
urgent tasks of the present revolution. Only when its complete
victory is attained can the working class, and the whole people,
really, quickly, boldly, freely and widely set to work to
solve the fundamental problem of the whole of civilised mankind: the
emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital.


We shall also deal carefully with the question of the means of struggle
in the election campaign and in the conclusion of partial agreements with other
parties. We shall explain what a constituent assembly is, and why the Cadets
fear it. We shall ask the liberal bourgeoisie, the Cadets, what measures they
intend to advocate and put into practice independently to make it
impossible for anyone to treat the people’s representatives in the way the
deputies of the “first enrolment” were “treated”. We
shall remind the Cadets of their vile and treacherous attitude towards the
October-December forms of struggle last year, and make it known to the
widest possible sections of the people. We shall ask every candidate whether he
intends to subordinate all his activities in the Duma entirely to the
interests of the struggle outside the Duma and the interests of wide
popular movement for land and freedom. We must take advantage of the election
campaign to organise the revolution, i.e., to organise the proletariat
and the really revolutionary elements of bourgeois democracy.


Such is the positive content which we must try to impart to the whole
election campaign and, in particular, to the matter of entering into partial
agreements with other parties.

 

Notes
 

[1]

It is interesting to note that experience of the distinction between
agreements at a lower stage and those at higher stages is to be found, too,
in the practice of the international Social-Democratic movement. In France,
the election of Senators takes place in two stages: the voters elect
departmental electors, who, in their turn, elect the Senators. The
revolutionary French Social-Democrats, the Guesdists, have never permitted
any agreements or joint lists at the lower stage, but have permitted
partial agreements at the higher stage, i.e., for the distribution of seats
in the assemblies of the departmental electors. The opportunists, however,
the Jaurèsists, entered into agreements even at the lower stage.—Lenin

[2]

For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming a purely and exclusively
party distribution of electors. In practice, of course, we shall meet with
many non-party electors. The task of the Social-Democratic electors will be
to try as far as possible to ascertain the political character of all,
especially of the bourgeois-democratic electors, and to form a “Left
majority” consisting of the Social-Democrats and the bourgeois candidates
most desirable for the Social-Democrats. The main criteria for
distinguishing between party trends we shall discuss later.—Lenin

[3]

This is what Soznatelnaya Rossiya[4]

called the Popular Socialists. Incidentally, the first and second issues of
this publication have given us great satisfaction. Chernov, Vadimov and
others brilliantly criticise both Peshekhonov and
Tag—in. Particularly good is the refutation of Tag—in’s arguments from
the point of view of the theory of commodity production, developing through
capitalism into socialism.—Lenin

The Social-Democrats and Electoral Agreements



    

VII

To sum up.


In their general election tactics the Social-Democrats must take as their
starting-point the complete independence of the class party of the revolutionary
proletariat.

 

This general principle may be departed from only in cases of extreme necessity
      and under specially limited conditions.


The specific features of the Russian electoral system and the political groupings
among the overwhelming mass of the population, tie peasantry, do riot give rise
to this extreme necessity at the lower stages of the election campaign, i.e.,
during the election of electors in the big cities and of the one-
per-ten-household representatives and delegates in the countryside.
It does not arise in
the big cities because here the importance of the elections is not at
all determined by the number of deputies to be sent into the Duma, but by
the opportunities for the Social-Democrats to address the widest and most
concentrated sections of the population, which are the “most
Social-Democratic” in virtue of their whole position.


In the countryside, the fact that the masses are politically undeveloped and
amorphous, the sparse and scattered nature of the population, and the external
conditions of the elections especially provoke the development of non-party (and
non-party revolutionary) organisations, associations, circles, assemblies,
opinions and strivings. Under these circumstances, blocs are quite unnecessary
at the lower stages. Strict adherence to Party principle in all respects is the
most correct and most expedient policy for Social-Democrats.


Thus, the general proposition that an alliance between the proletariat and the
revolutionary peasantry is necessary leads us to the conclusion that the only
agreements that are necessary are partial agreements (such as agreements with
the Trudoviks against the Cadets) at the higher stages of the electoral system,
i.e., in the assemblies of delegates and electors. The special features of the
political divisions among the Trudoviks also recommend this solution of the
problem.


In all these partial agreements the Social-Democrats must strictly distinguish
between the different bourgeois-democratic parties and the various shades among
them according to the degree of consistency and steadfastness of their
democratic convictions.


The ideological and political content of the election campaign and of the
partial agreements will lie in explaining

    

the theory of socialism and the independent, slogans of the Social-Democrats in
the present revolution, both in regard to the aims of this revolution and the
ways and means of achieving them.



This pamphlet was written before Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 5, had
appeared. Prior to the issue of this number our Party had every reason to hope
that the Central Committee of our Party would absolutely disapprove of
first-stage agreements with bourgeois parties, agreements which should be
impermissible for socialists. We could not help thinking so, for such an
influential Menshevik as Comrade L. Martov had emphatically expressed
his opposition to all agreements at the first stage, writing not only
in Tovarishch, but also in a letter sent out from the Central
Committee to the organisations (written by Martov) on the question of preparing
for the election campaign.


It now turns out that our Central Committee has gone over to Cherevanin or, at
least, has wavered. The leading article in Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 5,
sanctions blocs at the first stage, without even indicating
precisely with which bourgeois parties! Today’s (October 31) letter from
Plekhanov, who for the purpose of defending a bloc with the Cadets has migrated
to the Cadet newspaper Tovarishch, makes it clear to all whose
influence it was that caused the Central Committee to waver. And Plekhanov, as
usual, with the air of an oracle, delivers the most banal platitudes, entirely
evading the class aims of the socialist proletariat (perhaps out of politeness
to the bourgeois newspaper which has given him shelter), and does not even
attempt to touch on concrete facts and arguments.


Will this “peremptory command” from Geneva be sufficient to cause
the Central Committee to slip from Martov ... to Cherevanin?


Will the decision of the Unity Congress, which prohibited all agreements with
bourgeois parties, be nullified by the Central Committee that was elected at
that Congress?


The united election campaign of the Social-Democrats is threatened with serious
danger.

 

The socialist workers’ party is threatened with the danger of first-stage
      agreements with the bourgeois parties, which will demoralise the Party and
      prove fatal to the class independence of the proletariat.


Let all revolutionary Social-Democrats rally and declare
relentless war upon opportunist confusion and vacillation!

The tactics of boycotting the State Duma, which helped the mass of
the people to form a correct opinion of the impotence and lack of
independence of that institution, found complete justification in the farcical
legislative activities of the State Duma and in its dissolution.


But the counter-revolutionary behaviour of the bourgeoisie and the compromising
tactics of the Russian liberals
prevented the immediate success of the boycott and compelled the proletariat to
take up the struggle against the land lord and bourgeois counter-revolution also
on the basis of
the Duma campaign.


The Social-Democrats must wage this struggle outside the Duma and in the Duma
itself in order to develop the class-consciousness of the proletariat, to
further expose to the whole people the harmfulness of constitutional illusions,
and to develop the revolution.


In view of this state of affairs, and for the purposes mentioned above, the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party must take a most energetic part in the
present Duma campaign.

 

The principal objects of the Social-Democratic election and Duma campaigns are:
      firstly, to explain to the people the uselessness of the Duma as a means
      of satisfying the demands of the proletariat and the revolutionary petty
      bourgeoisie, especially the peasantry. Secondly, to explain to the people
      the impossibility of achieving political liberty by parliamentary methods
      as long as the real power remains in the hands of the tsar’s government,
      and to explain the necessity of an armed uprising, of a provisional
      revolutionary government and of a constituent assembly elected by
      universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot. Thirdly, to
      criticise the First Duma and reveal the bankruptcy of Russian liberalism,
      and especially to show how dangerous and fatal it would be for the cause
      of the revolution if the liberal-monarchist Cadet Party were to play the
      predominant and leading role in the liberation movement.


As the class party of the proletariat, the Social-Democratic Party must remain
absolutely independent throughout the election and Duma campaigns, and here,
too, must under no circumstances merge its slogans or tactics with those of any
other opposition or revolutionary party.


Therefore, at the first stage of the election campaign, i.e., before the masses,
it must as a general rule come out absolutely independently and put forward
only its own Party candidates.


Exceptions to this rule are permissible only in cases of extreme necessity and
only in relation to parties that fully accept the main slogans of our immediate
political struggle, i.e., those which recognise the necessity of an armed
uprising and are fighting for a democratic republic. Such agreements, however,
may only extend to the nomination of a joint list of candidates, without in any
way restricting the independence of the political agitation carried on by the
Social-Democrats.


In the workers’ curia the Social-Democratic Party must come out absolutely
independently and refrain from entering into agreements with any other
party.


At the higher stages of the election, i.e., at the assemblies of electors in the
towns and of delegates and electors in the countryside, partial agreements may
be entered into exclusively for the purpose of distributing seats
proportionately

    

to the number of votes cast for the parties entering the agreement. In this
connection, the Social-Democratic Party distinguishes the following main types
of bourgeois parties according to the consistency and determination of their
democratic views:

(a) the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Polish Socialist Party
and similar republican

       parties,[1]

(b) the Popular Socialists and the Trudoviks of
a similar

type;[2]

(c) the Cadets.

category.[4]—Lenin

The Second Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.
(“First All-Russian”) was held in Tammerfors November 3-7 (16-20), 1906,
attended by 32 delegates.


The conference heard four reports on the question of the election campaign f or
the Second State Duma. Lenin spoke in support of the Bolshevik platform and
against a bloc with the Cadets. Mensheviks and Bundists defended a bloc with
Cadets. By a majority of 15 votes to 14, the conference adopted a Menshevik
resolution. As a counter to this resolution Lenin put forward a
“Dissenting Opinion”, a Bolshevik platform signed by 14 delegates (6
Bolsheviks, 5 Polish and 3 Lettish Social-Democrats).


On November 6, Lenin spoke at the conference criticising the Menshevik draft
election platform presented by the Central Commit tee for confirmation by the
conference (the draft was published on November 3 (16) in
Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 6). The conference adopted a resolution for
introducing amendments into the draft election platform. On the same day Lenin
spoke in the debate on the convocation of an extraordinary Party congress and
insisted on the campaign

   

      for a “labour congress” being discussed as a question of
      violation of Party discipline.


While confirming the resolution on “Unity of the Election Campaign in the
Localities”, the conference adopted an amendment of Lenin’s. The text of
the resolution and Lenin’s amendment to it are given in his article “Party
Discipline and the Fight Against the Pro-Cadet Social-Democrats” (see
p. 323 of this volume). The conference instructed the Central Committee to
publish in the report of the conference all draft resolutions and dissenting
opinions. The Menshevik Central Committee, however, published only the
conference resolutions, omitting the dissenting opinion of the Bolsheviks (see
Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 7).


A criticism of the work of the conference was given by Lenin (in addition to the
above-mentioned article) in his article “Blocs with the Cadets” (see
pp. 307-19 of this volume).

Comrade workers, and all citizens of Russia! The Duma elections are
approaching. The Social-Democratic Party, the party of the working class, calls
upon you all to take part in the elections and so help to rally the forces that
are really capable of fighting for freedom.


In our revolution the mass of the people are fighting against the rule of the
government officials and the police, the landlords and the capitalists, and
first and foremost against the autocratic tsarist government. The masses are
fighting for land and liberty, for the overthrow of the gang of pogrom-mongers
and executioners, who reply to the demands of millions and scores of millions of
people by bribery, deception, brutal violence, imprisonment and military
courts.


By their strike in October 1905, the workers of all Russia wrung from the tsar a
promise of liberty and of a Duma with legislative powers. The tsarist government
broke these promises. The electoral law curtailed the rights of the peasants
and workers for the benefit of the landlords and capitalists. The powers of the
Duma itself were reduced almost to nil. But even that is not the main thing. The
main thing is that all these liberties and rights remained a dead letter, for
real authority, real power remained as before wholly in the hands of the tsarist
government. No Duma can or will give the people land and liberty as long as real
power remains in the hands of the pogrom-mongers and throttlers of liberty.


This is why the revolutionary workers, together with the majority of the
conscious fighters for liberty in other sections of the population, boycotted
the Duma. The boycott of the Duma was an attempt to take the convocation of the
people’s representatives out of the hands of the pogrom-mongers. The boycott
of the Duma was a warning to the people not to believe in scraps of paper; it
was a call to fight for

    

real power. The boycott failed, because the liberal bourgeoisie betrayed the
cause of liberty. The Cadets—the party of “people’s” freedom,
that party of liberal landlords and “en lightened” bourgeois
windbags—turned their backs on the heroic struggle of the proletariat,
described as folly the risings of the peasantry and of the best units of the
armed forces, and took part in the elections organised by the
pogrom-mongers. Thanks to the treachery of the Cadet bourgeoisie, the
whole people must
reckon for a time with laws and elections which the pogrom-mongers have
organised, which the pogrom-mongers have falsified and which the pogrom-mongers
have converted into a mockery of the people.


In taking part in the elections now, however, we can and must open the eyes of
the people to the necessity of a struggle for power, to the futility of the
Cadets’ playing at constitutions. Citizens of all Russia! Reflect on the
lessons that the First Duma has taught us!


The fighters for liberty and for land for the peasants were killed, exiled or
imprisoned. The Cadets had a majority in the Duma. These liberal bourgeois were
afraid of the struggle, were afraid of the people, were content to make
speeches and present petitions; they appealed to the people to wait patiently;
they endeavoured to make an agreement, to strike a bargain with the
pogrom-mongers’ government. And the tsar, perceiving that he was dealing with
cringing bourgeois and not with men of fighting spirit, sent them packing for
making objectionable speeches.


Workers, peasants and all toilers! Do not forget this great lesson! Remember
that in the autumn of 1905, when the revolutionary workers were at the head of
the struggling people, when the workers’ strike and the workers’ uprising were
reinforced by risings of peasants and politically-conscious soldiers, the
government made concessions. But when, in the spring and summer of 1906, the
people were headed by the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, the Cadets, the party
of vacillation between the power of the people and the power of the
pogrom-mongers, then instead of obtaining concessions the deputies were booted
out of the Duma by the police and the Duma was dissolved.


The dissolution of the Duma has clearly revealed to every one how futile and
fruitless are Cadet petitions, and how

    

      necessary it is to support the struggle of the proletariat. By its strike in
      October the working class extorted a promise of freedom. Now it is
      mobilising its forces in order, by means of an uprising of the whole
      people, to wrest real freedom from the hands of the enemy, to overthrow
      the tsarist government, to establish a republic, to secure that all state
      authorities without exception are elected, and to convene through a
      provisional revolutionary government a national constituent assembly
      elected on the basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret
      ballot.


The liberty for which the working class is fighting is liberty for the whole
people, not merely for the nobility and the rich. The workers need liberty in
order to launch a wide struggle for the complete emancipation of labour from the
tyranny of capital, for the abolition of all exploitation of man by man, for a
socialist system of society. As long as the rule of capital remains, no
equality, not even equality of tenure for small peasant proprietors on the
common land of the people, will save the people from poverty, unemployment and
oppression. Only the solidarity of all the workers, supported

b; 

the mass of the
working people, can overthrow the yoke of capital, which is weighing so heavily
on the workers of all countries. In socialist society, liberty and equality
will no longer be a sham; the working people will no longer be divided by
working in small, isolated, private enterprises; the wealth accumulated by
common labour will serve the mass of the people and not oppress them; the rule
of the workers will abolish all oppression of one nation, religion or sex by
another.


Comrade workers, and all citizens of Russia! Make use of the elections to
strengthen the real champions of liberty and socialism, to open the eyes of all
to the real aims and the true character of the various parties!


Besides the Social-Democrats, three main groups of parties are taking part in
the elections: the Black Hundreds, the Cadets, and the Trudoviks.


The Black Hundreds are the parties supporting the government. They stand for
an autocratic monarchy, police rule and the perpetuation of landlordism. They
are: the Monarchist Party, the Union of the Russian People, the Party of Law
and Order, the Commercial and Industrial Party, the

    

Union of October Seventeenth and the Party of Peaceful Renovation. These are all
open enemies of the people, direct champions of the pogrom-mongers’ government,
the government which dissolved the Duma, the government of military courts.


The Cadets (Constitutional-Democrats, or the “party of people’s freedom”)
are the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie. The liberal
bourgeoisie are oscillating between the people and the pogrom-mongers’
government. In words they oppose the government, but in fact what they fear most is
the struggle of the people; they want to come to terms with the monarchy, i.e.,
with the pogrom-mongers, against the people. In the Duma the Cadets pro posed
repressive laws against the press and against public meetings. In the Duma the
Cadets were opposed to referring the land question to local committees elected
on the basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot. The
Cadets are liberal landlords, who are afraid that the peasants might settle the
land question in their own way. Those who do not want the police regime to be
able to disperse the people’s deputies, those who do not want the peasants to
have to bear land redemption payments as ruinous as those of 1861, must see to
it that the Second Duma will not be a Cadet Duma like the First.


The Trudoviks are parties and groups which express the interests and views of
the small proprietors, mainly the small peasants. The most timid of these
parties is the Toilers’ Popular Socialist Party; it is little better than the
Cadets. Then follows the Duma “Trudovik Group”, the best members of
which, such as Onipko, assisted in the popular uprising after the dissolution of
the Duma. The most revolutionary of the Trudovik parties is the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The Trudoviks are inclined resolutely—some
times even to the point of an uprising—to uphold the interests of the
peasant masses in their struggle for land and liberty, but in their activities
they are by no means always able to shake off the influence of the liberal
bourgeois and bourgeois views. The small proprietor stands at the parting of the
ways in the great world-wide struggle between labour and capital. He has either
to try to “get on in the world” in bourgeois fashion and become a
master himself, or to try

    

to help the proletariat overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie. We, the
      Social-Democrats, will use the elections to tell the peasant masses and
      all friends of the peasantry that the only way by which the peasants will
      be able to get land and liberty is not through petitions, but by
      fighting, not by relying on the tsar and the promises of the liberal
      bourgeoisie, but by relying on the power of a united struggle shoulder to
      shoulder with the working class.


The Social-Democratic Party is the party of the class-conscious, militant
proletariat. It has no faith in any promises of the bourgeoisie; it seeks
salvation from poverty and want not through the consolidation of small
production, but through the united struggle of all the working people for
socialism.


Comrade workers, and all of you who are employees of capital! You have all seen
that when the government deprived you of the beginnings of liberty the
bourgeoisie proceeded to deprive the workers of all their gains, to increase
hours and cut wages again, to increase fines, to tighten the screw generally, to
harass or dismiss class-conscious workers. Only by the triumph of liberty can
the workers and office employees safeguard what they have won from the
bourgeoisie, and secure an eight-hour day, higher wages, and tolerable
conditions of life. And only by a united, concerted, supremely heroic struggle
at the head of the mass of the working people can the working class win real
liberty for the whole people.


Comrade workers, and all citizens of Russia! Vote for the candidates of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party! It is a party that is fighting for
complete freedom, for a republic, for the election of government officials by
the people. It is fighting against all national oppression. It is fighting for
all the land to be given to the peasantry with out
compensation. It is supporting all the demands of the politically conscious
sailors and soldiers by fighting to secure the abolition of the standing army
and the substitution for it of the armed nation.


Comrade workers, and all citizens of Russia! Vote for the candidates of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party!

At the All-Russian Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. the Mensheviks, with the aid of
the Bundists, secured the adoption of a resolution permitting blocs with the
Cadets. The Cadet press is jubilant, and is spreading the happy tidings to all
ends of the earth, gently pushing the Mensheviks one step lower, one step
further to the right. Elsewhere the reader will find the decisions of the
conference, the dissenting opinion of the revolutionary Social-Democrats, and
their draft election

       address.[1]

Here we shall attempt to outline the general and
fundamental political significance of blocs with the Cadets.


Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 6, provides good material for such an outline,
especially the editorial entitled “A Bloc of the Extreme Left”. We
shall begin with one of the most characteristic passages in the article:


“We are told,” writes Sotsial-Demokrat, “that the
Mensheviks, who had set out to push the whole Duma on to the revolutionary path,
abandoned their position after the dissolution of the Duma and formed a bloc
with the revolutionary parties and groups, which was expressed, firstly, in the
issue of two joint manifestoes—to the army and to the peasantry—and,
secondly, in the formation of a committee for co-ordinating action in view of
the forthcoming strike. This reference to precedent is based on a great
misunderstanding. In the instance quoted, our Party concluded with the other
revolutionary parties and groups not a political bloc, but a
fighting agreement, which we have always considered expedient and
necessary.”

 

The italics are those of Sotsial-Demokrat.


...Not a political bloc, but a fighting agreement.... For the
love of God. Menshevik comrades! This is not only nonsensical, it is positively
illiterate. One of two things: either you mean by a bloc only parliamentary
agreements, or you mean other agreements besides parliamentary agreements. If
the first is the case—then a bloc is a fighting agreement for a
parliamentary fight. If the second is the case—then a fighting agreement
is a political bloc, because a “fight” without a political purpose
is not a fight, but merely a brawl.


Comrades of the Central Committee! Watch your editors! You really must, because
they are making us feel ashamed of Social-Democracy.


But perhaps this rigmarole presented to the reader in the organ of the Central
Committee is simply a slip of the pen, an awkward expression?


Not at all. The Sotsial-Demokrat’s mistake was not the
“howler” it committed; on the contrary, the howler arose out of the
fundamental mistake that lies at the bottom of its whole argument and whole
position. The meaningless combination of words “not a political
bloc but a fighting

      agreement”[2]

is not fortuitous; it followed
necessarily and inevitably from the basic “meaninglessness” of
Menshevism, namely, its failure to understand that the parliamentary fight in
Russia today is entirely subordinate, and most directly so, to the conditions
and character of the fight out side of parliament. In other words: this one
logical blunder expresses the Mensheviks’ general failure to understand the role
and importance of the Duma in the present revolutionary situation.


We, of course, do not intend to copy the methods of the Mensheviks, and of their
leader Plekhanov, in their polemics against us on the question of
“fighting” and “politics”. We shall not reproach them,
leaders of the Social-Democratic proletariat, for being capable of entering into
a non-political fighting agreement.

 

We call attention to the following question: Why did our Mensheviks,
after the dissolution of the Duma, have to form a bloc only with the
revolutionary parties and groups? Certainly not because this had been
advocated for a long time (purely out of hatred for the Mensheviks) by some
anarcho-Blanquist named Lenin. Objective conditions compelled the
Mensheviks, in spite of all their theories, to form precisely such a
revolutionary anti-Cadet bloc. Whether the Mensheviks wanted it or not, and
whether they realised it or not, the objective conditions were such
that the dialectical development of the peaceful parliamentary fight in the
First Duma converted it, in the course of a few days, into one that was
altogether unpeaceful and non-parliamentary. The informal political
bloc of which the Mensheviks were not aware (because of the Cadet blinkers
on their eyes)— a bloc expressed in common aspirations, common immediate
political efforts and common methods of struggle for immediate political
aims—this unintentional “political bloc” was by the force
of circumstances transformed into a “fighting agreement”. And
our wiseacres were so dumbfounded by this unexpected turn of events, unforeseen
in Plekhanov’s letters of the period of the First Duma,[5]

that they exclaimed:

“This is not a political bloc, but a fighting agreement!”


The reason why your policy is no good at all, dear comrades, is that you have
in mind agreements for that “fight” which is unreal,
fictitious and of no decisive importance, and overlook the conditions of
that “fight” which is being irresistibly brought to the
fore by the whole course of the Russian revolution; the fight which arises even
from conditions that at first sight seem to be the most peaceful,
parliamentary and constitutional imaginable, and even from such conditions as those
which the Rodichevs of the Duma exalted in their speeches about the
dearly-beloved, blameless monarch.


You are committing the very error of which you groundlessly accuse the
Bolsheviks. Your policy is not a fighting policy. Your fight is not a genuine
political fight, but a sham constitutional fight; it is parliamentary
cretinism. For the “fight” which circumstances may make necessary
tomorrow you have one line of agreements; for “politics”
you have another line of agreements. That is why you are no good either

    

      for “fights” or for “politics”, but only for the role of
      yes-men of the Cadets.


There is considerable controversy in our Party at the present time as to the
meaning of the word “blocs”. Some say that a bloc, means a joint
list of candidates; others deny this and say that it means a common
platform. All these disputes are silly and scholastic. It does not make the
slightest difference whether the narrower or the wider agreements are called
blocs. The central issue is not whether wide or narrow agreements are
permissible. Whoever thinks so is immersing himself in petty and trivial
parliamentary technique and forgetting the political substance of that
technique. The central issue is: on what lines should the socialist
proletariat enter into agreements, with the bourgeoisie, which, generally
speaking, are inevitable in the course of a bourgeois revolution. The
Bolsheviks may differ among themselves in regard to details, e.g., whether
electoral agreements are necessary with this or that party of the revolutionary
bourgeoisie, but that is not the central issue between the Bolsheviks and the
Mensheviks. The central issue remains the same:

should the socialist proletariat in a bourgeois revolution follow in the wake of
the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, or should it march in front of the
revolutionary-democratic bourgeoisie.


The article “A Bloc of the Extreme Left” gives numerous instances of
how the ideas of the Mensheviks are side-tracked from the political essence of
the disagreement to petty trifles. The author of the article himself describes
(p. 2, col. 3) both a common platform and a joint list as bloc tactics. At the
same time he asserts that we are advocating a “bloc” with the
Trudoviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, while the Mensheviks advocate, not
a bloc, but only “partial agreements” with the Cadets. But this is
childishness, my dear comrades, and not argument!


Compare the Menshevik resolution adopted by the All-Russian Conference with the
Bolshevik resolution. The latter imposes stricter conditions for agreements with
the Socialist-Revolutionaries than the former does for agreements with the
Cadets. This is indisputable, for, in the first place, the Bolsheviks permit
agreements only with parties which arc fighting for a republic and which
recognise the necessity

    

of an armed uprising, whereas the Mensheviks permit agreements with
“democratic opposition parties” generally. Thus, the Bolsheviks
defined the term “revolutionary bourgeoisie” by means of clear
political characteristics, whereas the Mensheviks, instead of a
political definition, presented merely a technical
parliamentary catchword. A republic and an armed uprising are definite
political categories. Opposition is a purely parliamentary term. This term is so
vague that it can include the Octobrists, and the Party of Peaceful Renovation,
and, in fact, all who are dissatisfied with the government. True, the addition
of the word “democratic” introduces a political element, but it is
indefinite. It is supposed to refer to the Cadets but this is exactly where it
is wrong. To apply the term “democratic” to a monarchist
party, to a party which accepts an Upper Chamber, proposed repressive laws
against public meetings and the press and deleted from the reply to the address
from the throne the demand for direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot, to a
party which opposed the formation of land committees elected by the whole
people—means deceiving the people. This is a very strong
expression, but it is just. The Mensheviks are deceiving the people about the
democracy of the Cadets.


Secondly, the Bolsheviks permit agreements with the bourgeois republicans only
as an “exception”. The Mensheviks do not demand that blocs with the
Cadets should be only an exception.


Thirdly, the Bolsheviks absolutely forbid agreements in the workers’ curia
(“with any other party”). The Mensheviks permit blocs in the
workers’ curia as well, for they only forbid agreements with groups and
parties which “do not adopt the standpoint of the proletarian class
struggle”. Thus is no accident, for at the Conference there were some
Mensheviks with proletarian class intuition, who opposed this stupid formula,
but they were defeated by the Menshevik majority. The outcome was something very
indefinite and nebulous, leaving plenty of scope for all sorts of adventurist
moves. Moreover, the outcome was an idea that is altogether reprehensible for a
Marxist, namely, that a party other than a Social-Democratic Party may
be recognised as “adopting the standpoint of the proletarian class
struggle”.

 

After this, how can one describe as other than childish, to say the least, the
    attempts to prove that the Bolsheviks permit a closer bloc with
    the republican bourgeoisie, i.e., the Socialist-Revolutionaries, than the
    Mensheviks permit with the monarchist bourgeoisie, i.e., the Cadets??


The absolutely false argument about closer or less close blocs serves to obscure
the political question: with whom and for what purpose are blocs
permissible. Take the “Draft Election Platform” published in No. 6
of Sotsial-Demokrat. This document is one of a mass of documents
defining Menshevik policy which are proof of the existence of an
ideological bloc between the Mensheviks and the Cadets. The resolution
of the conference on the “amendments” required to this draft
election platform clearly demonstrates this. Just think: a conference of
Social-Democrats had to remind its Central Committee that it must not omit the
slogan of a republic from an illegal publication; that it must not confine
itself to vague platitudes about petitions and struggle, but must accurately
name and characterise the different parties from the proletarian standpoint;
that it must point to the need for an uprising and emphasise the class character
of social-Democracy! Only some deep-seated abnormality, some fundamental error
in the views held by the Central Committee could have made it necessary to
remind the Central Committee of the Social-Democratic Party that it must
emphasise the class character of the Party in its first election
manifesto.


We do not know yet whether practical agreements with the Cadets will be
concluded, or what their scope will be; but an ideological agreement, an
ideological bloc, already exists: in the draft election platform the difference
between the standpoint of the proletariat and that of the liberal-monarchist
bourgeoisie is glossed

over.[3]

The Bolshevik draft

    

election address, on the contrary, not only points out this difference, but also
the difference between the standpoint of the proletariat and that of the class
of small proprietors.


It is these principles and ideas that must be brought to the fore in the
question of election blocs. It is useless for the Mensheviks to attempt to
justify themselves by saying: we shall be independent throughout the election
campaign, which we shall in no way curtail, and we shall put our candidates in
the Cadets’ list only at the last minute!


That is not true. We are sure, of course, that the best of the
Mensheviks sincerely desire it. But it is not their desires that count,
however—it is the objective conditions of the present political
struggle. And these conditions are such that every step the Mensheviks
take in their election campaign is already tainted by Cadetism, is
already marked by obscuring the Social-Democratic point of view. We have
demonstrated this by the example of the draft election platform and shall now do
so by a number of other documents and arguments.


The Mensheviks’ main argument is the Black-Hundred danger. The first and
fundamental flaw in this argument is that the Black-Hundred danger cannot be
combated by Cadet tactics and a Cadet policy. The essence of this policy lies
in reconciliation with tsarism, that is, with the
Black-Hundred danger. The first Duma sufficiently demonstrated that the Cadets do
not combat the Black-Hundred danger, but make incredibly despicable speeches about
the innocence and blamelessness of the monarch, the known leader of the
Black Hundreds. Therefore, by helping to elect Cadets to the Duma, the
Mensheviks are not only failing to combat the Black-Hundred danger, but are
hoodwinking the people, are obscuring the real significance of the Black-Hundred
danger. Combating the Black-Hundred danger by helping to elect the Cadets to the
Duma is like combating pogroms by means of the speech delivered by the lackey
Rodichev:

“It is presumption to hold the monarch responsible for the pogrom.”

 

The second flaw in this stock argument is that it means that the
    Social-Democrats tacitly surrender hegemony in the democratic struggle to
    the Cadets. In the event of a split vote that secures the victory of a
    Black Hundred, why should we be blamed for not having voted for
    the Cadet, and not the Cadets for not having voted for us?


“We are in a minority,” answer the Mensheviks, in a spirit of
Christian humility. “The Cadets are more numerous. You cannot expect the
Cadets to declare themselves revolutionaries.”


Yes! But that is no reason why Social-Democrats should declare themselves
Cadets. The Social-Democrats have not had, and could riot have had, a majority
over the bourgeois democrats anywhere in the world where the outcome of the
bourgeois revolution was indecisive. But everywhere, in all countries,
the first independent entry of the Social-Democrats in an election
campaign has been met by the howling and barking of the liberals, accusing
the socialists of wanting to let the Black Hundreds in.


We are therefore quite undisturbed by the usual Menshevik cries that the
Bolsheviks are letting the Black Hundreds in. All liberals have shouted
this to all socialists. By refusing to fight the Cadets you are leaving
under the ideological influence of the Cadets masses of proletarians and semi
proletarians who are capable of following the lead of the

  Social-Democrats.[4]

Now or later, unless you cease to be socialists, you will have to fight
independently, in spite of the Black-Hundred danger. And it is easier and more
necessary to take the right step now than it will be later on. In the elections
to the Third Duma (if it is convoked after the Second Duma) it will be even more
difficult for you to dissolve the bloc with the Cadets, you will be still more
entangled in unnatural relations with the betrayers of the revolution. But the
real Black-Hundred danger, we repeat, lies not in the Black Hundreds
obtaining seats in the Duma, but in pogroms and military courts; and you are
making it more difficult

    

for the people to fight this real danger by putting Cadet blinkers on
their eyes.


The third flaw in this stock argument is its inaccurate appraisal of the Duma
and its role. In that delightful article “A Bloc of the Extreme
Left”, the Mensheviks had to acknowledge, contrary to all the
assertions they usually make, that the central issue lies not in technical
agreements,

hut 

in the radical political difference between two tactics.


In this article we read the following:



“The tactics of a ’bloc’ are consciously or unconsciously directed towards
the formation in the next Duma of a compact revolutionary minority of a faded
Social-Democratic hue, a minority that would wage systematic war on the Duma
majority as well as on the government, and, at a certain moment, would
overthrow the Duma and proclaim itself a provisional government. The tactics of
partial agreements are directed towards making use, as far as possible, of the
Duma as a whole, i. e., the Duma majority, for the purpose of fighting the
autocratic regime while retaining all the time in the Duma the extreme position of
an independent Social-Democratic Group.”



As regards the “faded hue” we have already shown that it is the
Mensheviks who are to blame for this—by their conduct in the elections in
the workers’ curia, by their wider latitude for blocs, and by their ideological
substitution of Cadetism for Social-Democracy. As for “proclaiming”
a provisional government, the Mensheviks’ assertion is equally ridiculous, for
they forget that it is not a matter of proclaiming, but of the whole course and
of the success of the uprising. A provisional government which is not
the organ of an uprising is an empty phrase, or a senseless adventure.


But on the central issue, the Mensheviks inadvertently blurted out the real
truth in the above-quoted passage. Indeed, the whole thing boils down to this:
shall we or shall we not sacrifice the independence of the
Social-Democratic election campaign for the sake of a “solid”
liberal Duma (“the Duma as a whole”)? And indeed, the most important thing
for the Bolsheviks is complete independence in the election campaign and the
completely (not semi-Cadet) Social-Democratic character of our policy and of our
Duma Group. But for the Mensheviks the most important thing is a solid Cadet
Duma with a large number of Social-Democrats elected as semi-Cadets! Two types
of Duma: 200 Black Hundreds, 280 Cadets and 20 Social-Democrats; or 400

    

Cadets and 100 Social-Democrats. We prefer the first type, and we think it is
      childish to imagine that the elimination of the Black Hundreds from the
      Duma means the elimination of the Black-Hundred danger.


Everywhere we have a single policy: in the election fight, in the fight in the
Duma, and in the fight in the streets—the policy of the armed
struggle. Everywhere our policy is: the Social-Democrats with the revolutionary
bourgeoisie against the Cadet traitors. The Mensheviks, however, wage their
“Duma” fight in alliance with the Cadets (support for the Duma as a
whole and a Cadet Cabinet); but in the event of an uprising they will change
their policy and conclude “not a political bloc, but a
fighting agreement”. Therefore, the Bolshevik was quite right who remarked
at the conference:

“By supporting blocs with the Cadets, the Bundists have smuggled in support
for a Cadet Cabinet.”


The above quotation excellently confirms the fact that blocs with the Cadets
convert into empty phrases all the fine words in the Menshevik resolution on
slogans in the election campaign. For example: “to organise the forces of
the revolution in the Duma” (is it not rather to organise an appendage to
the Cadets by disorganising the actual forces of the revolution?); “to
expose the impotence of the Duma” (is it not rather to conceal from the
masses the impotence of the Cadets?); “to explain to the masses that hopes
of a peaceful issue of the struggle are illusory” (is it not rather to
strengthen among the masses the influence of the Cadet Party, which is fostering
illusions?).


And the Cadet press has perfectly understood the political
significance of Menshevik-Cadet blocs. We said above:

either in the rear of the liberals or in front of the revolutionaries. In
support of this we shall cite our political press.


Can you find any serious or mass confirmation of the assertion that the
Bolsheviks are following in the wake of the bourgeois revolutionaries and are
dependent on them? It is ridiculous even to speak of such a thing. The whole
Russian press clearly shows, and all the enemies of the revolutionaries admit,
that it is the Bolsheviks who are pursuing an independent political line, and
are winning over various groups and the best elements of the bourgeois
revolutionaries.

 

But what about the bourgeois opportunists? They own a press ten times larger
than that of the Social-Democrats and the Socialist-Revolutionaries put
together. And they are pursuing an independent political line, converting the
Mensheviks and Popular Socialists into mere yes-men.


The whole Cadet press quotes only those parts of the
Menshevik resolutions which refer to blocs; it omits “the impotence
of the Duma”, “the organisation of the forces of the revolution in
the Duma”, and other things. The Cadets not only omit these things, they
openly rail against them, now talking about the
“phrase-mongering” or the “inconsistency” of the
Mensheviks, now about the “inconsistency of the Menshevik slogans”,
and at another time about “the baneful influence of the Bolsheviks over
the Mensheviks”.


What does this mean? It means that, whether we like it or not, and in spite of
the wishes of the better sort of Mensheviks, political life absorbs their
Cadet deeds and rejects their revolutionary phrases.


The Cadet coolly accepts the help of the Mensheviks, slaps Plekhanov on the back
for his advocacy of blocs, and at the same time shouts contemptuously and
rudely, like a merchant who has grown fat on ill-gotten gains: Not enough,
Menshevik gentlemen! There must also be an ideological understanding! (See the
article in Tovarishch on Plekhanov’s letter.) Not enough, Menshevik
gentlemen, you must also stop your polemic, or at any rate change its tone! (See
the leading article in the Left-Cadet Vek on the resolutions of our
Conference.) Not to mention Rech, which simply snubbed the Mensheviks
who are yearning for the Cadets by bluntly declaring: “We shall go into
the Duma to legislate”, not to make a revolution!


Poor Mensheviks, poor Plekhanov! Their love letters to the Cadets were read with
pleasure, but so far they are not being admitted further than the antechamber.


Read Plekhanov’s letter in the bourgeois-Cadet newspaper Tovarishch.
How joyfully he was greeted by Mr. Prokopovich and Madame Kuskova, the very
people whom Plekhanov, in 1900, drove out of the Social-Democratic Party for at
tempting its bourgeois corruption. Now Plekhanov has accepted the tactics of
the famous Credo[6]

of Prokopovich and Kuskova; and these followers of Bernstein are impudently

    

blowing kisses to him and shouting: We bourgeois democrats have always
    said this!


And in order to be admitted to the antechamber of the Cadets, Plekhanov had
publicly to withdraw the statements he made bat yesterday.


Here are the facts.


In Dnevnik, No. 6, of July 1906, after the dissolution of the Duma
Plekhanov wrote that the parties that are participating in the
movement must come to an understanding. To be able to strike together, they must
first come to an agreement. “The parties hostile to our
old regime must ... come to an agreement about what is to he the main idea in
this propaganda. After the dissolution of the Duma the only idea that can serve
this purpose is the idea of a constituent assembly....”


“Only” the idea of a constituent assembly. Such was
Plekhanov’s plan for a political bloc and for a fighting agreement in July
1906.


Five months later, in November 1906, Plekhanov changes his policy on
agreements. Why? Has there been any change since then in the relations between
the parties which demand a constituent assembly and those which do not?


It is generally admitted that since then the Cadets have shifted still further
to the right. And Plekhanov goes to the Cadet press but says
nothing about the constituent assembly; for it is forbidden to speak
about this in liberal antechambers.


Is it not clear that this Social-Democrat has slipped? But this is not all. In
the same No. 6 of Dnevnik, Plekhanov referred directly to the
Cadets. At that time (that was such a long time ago!) Plekhanov
explained the selfish class character of the Cadets’ distrust towards the idea
of a constituent assembly. Plekhanov at that time wrote about the Cadets
literally as follows:


“Whoever renounces the propaganda of this idea [a constituent assembly] on
whatever pretext will clearly indicate that he is not really seeking a worthy
answer to the actions of Stolypin & Co., that he, though reluctantly, is
becoming reconciled to these actions, that he is rebelling against them
only in words, only for the sake of appearances” (italics ours).

 

Having now gone over to a Cadet newspaper, Plekhanov began his advocacy of an
election bloc by establishing an ideological bloc. In the Cadet newspaper
Plekhanov did not want to tell the people that the Cadets are becoming
reconciled to the Stolypin gang, that they are rebelling only for the
sake of appearances.


Why did Plekhanov not want to repeat in November 1906 what he said in July 1906?



This, then, is what “technical” blocs with the Cadets mean, and that
is why we are waging a relentless struggle against Social-Democrats who sanction
such blocs.


Is not your joy premature, gentlemen of the Cadet Party? Social-Democrats will
vote in the elections without blocs in the Caucasus, in the Urals, in Poland, in
the Lettish Territory, in the Moscow Central Region, and probably in
St. Petersburg.


No blocs with the Cadets! No conciliation with those who are becoming reconciled
to the Stolypin gang!

And, as luck would have it, we now have the curious situation that the
Mensheviks, who have always reproached us with contrasting “fighting” to
“politics”, have themselves based their entire argument
on this meaningless contrast.—Lenin

[3]

This is not the first time the Mensheviks have made this mistake.  They
made the same mistake in the famous Duma declaration of the R.S.D.L.P. They
accused the Bolsheviks of Socialist-Revolutionary tendencies, while they
themselves obliterated the differences between the views of the
Social-Democrats and those of the Trudoviks to such an extent that the
Socialist-Revolutionary newspapers of the Duma period called the Duma
declaration of the Social-Democrats a plagiary of Socialist-Revolutionary
ideas! In our counter-draft of the Duma declaration,[7]
   

on the contrary, the difference between us and the petty bourgeois was
clearly shown.—Lenin

[4]

The Cadets themselves are beginning to acknowledge that in the
elections they are threatened by a danger from the Left (the exact
words used by Rech in a report on the St. Petersburg Gubernia). By
their outcry against the Black-Hundred danger, the Cadets are leading the
Mensheviks by the nose in order to avert the danger from the Left!!—Lenin

This refers to G. V. Plekhanov’s “Letters on Tactics
and Tactlessness”, which defined Menshevik tactics in regard to the State
Duma.

The Bolshevik draft of the Duma declaration was written
by Lenin; he quotes it in the article “Concerning the Declaration of Our
Duma Group” (see pp. 33-36 of this volume).

The sanction of blocs with the Cadets is the finishing touch that definitely
marks the Mensheviks as the opportunist wing of the workers’ party. We are
waging a ruthless ideological struggle against the formation of blocs with the
Cadets, and this struggle must be developed to the widest possible extent. Thu;
will do more than anything to educate and unite the masses of the revolutionary
proletariat, whom our independent (really, and not merely in name,
i.e., without blocs with the Cadets) election campaign will provide with fresh
material for the development of their class-consciousness.


The question is how to combine this ruthless ideological struggle with
proletarian party discipline. This question must be put squarely and fully
explained at once, so that there may be no misunderstanding and no
vacillation in the practical policy of revolutionary Social-Democracy.


Let us first consider the theoretical aspect of this question, and then the
practical aspect which is of immediate interest to everybody.


We have more than once already enunciated our theoretical views on the
importance of discipline and on how this concept is to be understood in the
party of the working class. We defined it as: unity of action, freedom of
discussion and criticism. Only such discipline is worthy of the democratic
party of the advanced class. The strength of the working class lies in
organisation. Unless the masses are organised, the proletariat is
nothing. Organised—it is everything. Organisation means unity of action,
unity in practical operations. But every action is valuable, of course, only
because

    

and insofar as it serves to push things forward and not back ward, insofar as it
serves to unite the proletariat ideologically, to elevate, and not degrade,
corrupt or weaken it. Organisation not based on principle is meaningless, and in
practice converts the workers into a miserable appendage of the bourgeoisie in
power. Therefore, the proletariat does not recognise unity of action without
freedom to discuss and criticise. Therefore, class-conscious workers must never
forget that serious violations of principle occur which make the severance of
all organisational relations imperative.


To prevent some literary hack from misinterpreting what I say, I shall pass at
once from the general to the concrete formulation of the question. Does the
sanction by Social-Democrats of blocs with the Cadets necessitate a complete
severance of organisational relations, i.e., a split? We think not, and
all Bolsheviks think the same way. In the first place, the Mensheviks are only
just setting their feet, unsteadily and uncertainly, on the path of practical
opportunism en grand. The ink is not yet dry on Martov’s repudiation of
Cherevanin for sanctioning blocs with the Cadets; he wrote it before the Cadet
password had been given from Geneva.[1]

Secondly—and this is far more
important—the objective conditions of the proletarian struggle in Russia
today irresistibly provoke definite and decisive steps. Whether the
tide of revolution rises very high (as we expected) or completely subsides (as
some Social-Democrats think it will, though they are afraid to say so), in
either case the tactics of blocs with the Cadets will inevitably be
scattered to the winds, and that in the not very distant future. Therefore, our
duty at the present time is to avoid intellectualist hysteria and
preserve Party unity, trusting to the staunchness and sound class instinct of
the revolutionary proletariat. Thirdly and lastly, in the present election
campaign, the decision of the Mensheviks and the Central Committee in favour of
blocs is not binding in practice on the local organisations, and does not commit
the Party as a whole to these shameful tactics of blocs with the Cadets.


Now for the concrete formulation of the question. To what extent are the
resolutions of the All-Russian Conference of the Russian social-Democratic
Labour Party—and the directives

    

of the Central Committee—binding? And to what extent are the local
      organisations of the Party autonomous?


These questions would undoubtedly have caused endless disputes in our Party had
the conference itself not settled them. All the delegates at the
conference agreed that its decisions were not binding and
committed nobody in any way, for a conference is an advisory, not a deciding
body. Its delegates were not democratically elected, but were chosen by the
Central Committee from local organisations selected by it, and in a number which
it specified. For this reason, at the conference, the Bolsheviks, Letts
and Poles did not waste time tinkering with the Menshevik resolution on blocs,
nor did they work out a compromise (such as recognising the boycott as correct
and at the same time sanctioning blocs with the monarchist
bourgeoisie!), but simply put forward in opposition their own
platform, their own slogans, their own tactics in the election campaign. In so
doing the Bolsheviks took the course that was absolutely necessary at an
advisory conference, which was to serve not as a substitute for a congress, but
to prepare for it—not to settle the issue, but to bring it out more
clearly and precisely—not to conceal, not to gloss over the struggle
within the Party, but to direct it, to make it more integral and more centred
around principles.


To proceed. The decisions of the conference become (with certain modifications)
directives of the Central Committee. Directives of the Central Committee are
binding on the whole Party. Within what limits are they binding in regard to
this particular question?


Obviously, within the limits of the decisions of the Congress and within the
Limits of the autonomy of the local Party organisations that is recognised by
the Congress. The question of these limits might also have given rise to endless
and insoluble
controversy (for the resolution of the Unity Congress forbids all blocs with
bourgeois parties in the election campaign), had not the conference adopted,
by common consent of the Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks and the members
of the Central Committee, one of its least elastic resolutions. The absence
of factional divisions in the voting on this resolution is an important
guarantee of the unity and fighting efficiency of the workers’ party.

 

Here is the text of this resolution:



“The conference expresses it,s conviction that within the framework of a
single organisation all its members are obliged to carry out all decisions
concerning the election campaign adopted by the competent bodies of the local
organisations, within the limits of the general
directives of the Central Committee; the Central Committee may forbid
local organisations to put forward lists that are not purely
Social-Democratic, but it must not compel them to put forward lists
that are not purely Social-Democratic.”



The passage we have underlined obviates interminable disputes and, one may hope,
will obviate undesirable and dangerous friction. The general directives of the
Central Committee cannot go beyond the limits of recognising that blocs with the
Cadets are permissible. All the Social-Democrats, irrespective of
faction, declared at the time that, after all, blocs with the Cadets are not
very seemly, for we all authorised the Central Committee to forbid them, but we
did not authorise it to prescribe them.


The conclusion is clear. There are two platforms before the
Party. One—supported by 18 conference delegates, the Mensheviks and the
Bundists; the other—supported by 14 delegates, the Bolsheviks,
the Poles and the Letts. The competent bodies of the local organisations are
free to choose either of these platforms, to alter and supplement them, or
substitute new ones. After the competent bodies have decided,
all of us, as members of the Party, must act as one man. A
Bolshevik in Odessa must cast into the ballot box a ballot paper bearing a
Cadet’s name even if it sickens him. And a Menshevik in Moscow must cast into
the ballot box a ballot paper bearing only the names of Social-Democrats, even
if his soul is yearning for the Cadets.


But the elections are not taking place tomorrow. Let all the revolutionary
Social-Democrats rally still closer and launch the widest and most relentless
ideological struggle against blocs with the Cadets, blocs that will hinder the
revolution, weaken the proletarian class struggle, and corrupt the civic
consciousness of the masses!

At the elections to the First Duma the Armavir Social-Democrats formed blocs
with the Cadets. Volna[1]

commented on this at the time and severely
criticised them. The Central Committee of our Party also wrote to Armavir,
admonishing the local comrades for acting contrary to the instructions of the
Unity Congress.


Our Armavir comrades must now have gained some practical experience of what
blocs with the Cadets mean. At all events, in their latest party literature,
they not only refrain from advocating blocs with the Cadets, but speak the
whole plain truth about the Cadets. We will not quarrel with the literary
style of the Armavir publications—that would be mean and petty. We shall
only quote the most striking pas sages which indicate the tactics of the
Armavirians.


We have before us No. 1 of Armavirsky Proletary, published by the
Armavir Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, dated October
1906, and issued in 5,000 copies.


In the leading article we read the following:



“Let the Cadets, merchants, government officials, landlords and liberals
dance to the tune of the government, the proletariat will not take the line of
submission and reconciliation.”



The next article, a special appeal to get ready for the elections, states:



 “Close your ranks, vote, capture the Duma! Too long have the lordly
 Cadets sat in the plush seats of the Taurida Palace. It is high time the
 toil-hardened hands of the workers drove out these chatterers and parasites!

 

“Make haste to secure your poletarian 

place in the Duma, to convert it
      from a Cadet talking-shop into a revolutionary field of battle
against the slayer of the people, the accursed autocracy.”



In a leaflet: “To the Electors”, dated November 1906 and
issued in 3,000 copies, the Armavir Committee writes:



“The people have realised that only by force and power can they take that
which the dying autocracy will not yield voluntarily and which the impotent
Cadet Duma failed to give them.... Let us make this Duma an instrument of our
revolution, let us, through our deputies, install the power of the people in
the Taurida Palace, let us kindle in the new Duma, by the hands of our
deputies, the blazing fire of revolution and fan it with the stormy breath of
the whole of proletarian and revolutionary Russia. Into the new Duma, into the
new Duma!!


“...Comrades and citizens! Our future Duma will not be a Black Hundred
Duma, nor will it be a Cadet Duma—it will be a proletarian and peasant
Duma—our Duma, with full power.”



I repeat that it would be petty to quarrel with the style or the details of
these appeals.


The important thing is their spirit. The important thing is the independent
policy of the Armavir Social-Democrats, who have been through the purgatory of
blocs with wind-bags and parasites.


So much for your hopes in the Social-Democrats, gentlemen of Rech,
Tovarishch, Vek and Russkiye Vedomosti[2]

So much for the “danger from the Left” mentioned in Rech
the other day!


Into the struggle then, all revolutionary Social-Democrats! Into the struggle
against blocs with the Cadets! The Menshevik comrades will, like the
Armavirians, go through the purgatory of blocs with the bourgeois opportunists
and return to revolutionary Social-Democracy.

What Are the Three Chief Parties?



The Black Hundreds
The Cadets
The Social-Democrats






    They are—the Union of the Russian People, the monarchists, the
    Party of Law and Order, the Union of October Seventeenth,the
    Commercial and Industrial Party, the Party of Peaceful Renovation.
  

    They are—the party of “people’s” freedom or
    Constitutional-“Democratic” (in reality
    liberal-monarchist) Party, the Party of “Democratic”
    Reforms, the radicals, etc.
  

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. It is the party
    of the class-conscious-workers of all the nationalities of Russia,
    of Russians, Letts, Poles, Jews, Ukrainians, Armenians, Georgians,
    Tatars, etc.
  


Whose Interests Do the Three Chief Parties Defend?



The Black Hundreds defend the present tsarist government,
    they stand for the landlords, for the government
            officials, for the

    

    power of the police, for military courts, for pogroms.
  

The Cadets defend the interests of the liberal bourgeois, the
    liberal landlords, merchants and capitalists.  The Cadets are a
    party of bourgeois lawyers, journalists, professors and such like.
  

The Social-Democrats are the party of the working class,
    defending the interests of all the working and exploited people.
  


What Do the Three Chief Parties Strive For?



The Black Hundreds strive for the preservation of the old
    autocracy, the lack of rights of the people, the unlimited rule
    over it of the landlords, officials and police.
  

The Cadets strive for the transfer of power into the hands
    of the liberal bourgeoisie. The monarchy; by preserving the police
    and military regime, is to safeguard the capitalists’ right to rob
    the workers and peasants.
  

The Social-Democrats strive for the transfer of all power
    into the hands of the people, i.e., a democratic republic. The
    Social-Democrats need complete freedom in order to fight for
    socialism, for the emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital.
  


What Kind of Freedom do the Three Chief Parties Want
    to Give the People?



The Black Hundreds do not give the people any freedom, any
    power. All power is for the tsarist government. The rights of the
    people are: to pay taxes, to toil for the rich, to rot in gaol.
  

The Cadets want the kind of “people’s freedom” which
    will be subordinated, firstly, to the Upper Chamber, i.e., to the
    landlords and capitalists; secondly, to the monarchy, i. e., the
    tsar with the irresponsible police and armed forces. One-third of
    t.he power to the people, one-third to the capitalists and one-third
    to the tsar.
  

The Social-Democrats want complete freedom and all power
    for the people, all officials to be elected, the soldiers to be
    freed from barrack servitude, and the organisation of a free,
    people’s militia.
  

    


How Do the Three Chief Parties Regard the Peasants’
    Demand for Land?



The Black Hundreds defend the interests of the feudal landlords. No
    land for the peasants. Only the rich to be allowed to buy land from
    the landlords by voluntary agreement.
  

The Cadets want to preserve the landlord system of agriculture by
    means of concessions. They propose redemption payments by the
    peasants which already once before in 1861 ruined the peasants. The
    Cadets do not agree that the land question should be settled by
    local committees elected by universal, direct and equal suffrage by
    secret ballot.
  

The Social-Democrats want to abolish our landlord system of
    agriculture. All land must be transferred to the peasants
    absolutely, with out redemption payments. The land question must be
    settled by local committees elected by universal, direct and equal
    suffrage by secret ballot.
  


What Can the Three Chief Parties Achieve if Their
    Whole Struggle is Successful?



The Black Hundreds, using every possible means of struggle, can
    cause the people to be finally ruined and all Russia subjected to
    the savagery of military courts and pogroms.
  

The Cadets, using only “peaceful” means of struggle, can
    cause the pogrom-mongers’ government to buy off the big bourgeoisie
    and the rich in the countryside at the cost of petty concessions,
    while it will chase out the liberal chatter-boxes for insufficiently
    servile

    

    speeches about the beloved, blameless, inviolable, constitutional
    monarch.
  

The Social-Democrats, using every possible means of struggle,
    including an uprising, can, with the aid of the politically
    conscious peasantry and urban poor, win complete freedom and all the
    land for the peasants. And with freedom, and with the help of the
    class-conscious

    workers of all Europe, the Russian Social-Democrats can advance with
    rapid strides to socialism.
  



Citizens! Vote at the Elections for Candidates of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party!
Social-Democrats and the Trudovik Parties

Citizens! Anyone who wants to take an intelligent part in the elections to the
State Duma must first of all clearly understand the difference between the three
main parties. The Black Hundreds stand for pogroms and the violence of
the tsarist government. The Cadets stand for the interests of the
liberal landlords and capitalists. The Social-Democrats stand for the
interests of the working class and all the working and exploited people.


Anyone who wants to uphold intelligently the interests of the working class and
all working people must know which party is really able most consistently and
resolutely to defend these interests.




Which Parties Claim to Defend the Interests of the
    Working Class and all Working People?



    The party of the working class, the Russian Social-Democratic
    Labour Party, based on the standpoint of the
    class struggle of the proletariat.
  

Trudovik parties, i.e., parties based on the standpoint of the small
    proprietor:
  


The Socialist-Revolutionary Party.

The Trudovik (Popular Socialist) Party and the non-party Trudoviks.
  

    


Whose Interests do these Parties Actually Defend?



    The interests of the proletarians, whose conditions of life deprive
    them of all hope of becoming proprietors and cause them to strive
    for completely changing the whole basis of the capitalist social
    system.
  

    The interests of the petty proprietors, who struggle against
    capitalist oppression, but who, owing to the very conditions of
    their life, strive to become proprietors, to strengthen their petty
    economy and to enrich themselves by means of trade and hiring
    labour.
  


How Steadfast are These Parties in the Great
    World-Wide Struggle of Labour Against Capital?



The Social-Democrats cannot allow of any reconciliation of labour
    and capital. They organise the wage-workers for a ruthless struggle
    against capital, for the abolition of private ownership of the means
    of production and for the building of socialist society.
  

The toilers’ parties dream of abolishing the rule of capital but,
    owing to the conditions of life of the petty proprietor, they
    inevitably waver between fighting jointly with the wage-workers
    against capital and striving to reconcile workers and capitalists by
    the conversion of all the working people into petty proprietors,
    with equal division of land, or guaranteed credit, and so on.
  


What Can These Parties Achieve by Completely
    Fulfilling Their Ultimate Aims?



    The conquest of political power by the proletariat and the
    conversion of capitalist into social, large-scale, socialist
    production.
  

    The equal distribution of land among petty proprietors and small
    peasants, in which case there will inevitably be a struggle between
    them again, giving rise to a division into rich and poor, workers
    and capitalists.
  

    


What Kind of Freedom for the People are These Parties
    Trying to Achieve in the Present Revolution?



    Complete freedom and full power for the people, i. e., a democratic
    republic, officials to be subject to election, the replacement of
    the standing army by universal arming of the people.
  

    Complete freedom and full power for the people, i. e., a democratic
    republic, officials to be subject to election, the replacement of
    the standing army by universal arming of the people.
  

    A combination of democracy, i.e., full power of the people, with the
    monarchy, i.e., with the power of the tsar, police and
    officials. This is just as senseless a desire and just as
    treacherous a policy as that of the liberal landlords, the Cadets.
  


What Is the Attitude of These Parties to the Peasants’
    Demand For Land?



The Social-Democrats demand the transfer of all the landlords’ land
    to the peasants with out any redemption payments.
  

The Socialist-Revolutionaries demand the transfer of all the
    landlords’ land to the peasants without any redemption payments.
  

The Trudoviks demand the transfer of all the landlords’ land to the
    peasants, but they allow redemption payments, which will ruin the
    peasants, so that this is just as treacherous a policy as that of
    the liberal landlords, the Cadets.
  



Citizens! Vote at the Elections for Candidates
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party!

The leaflet “Whom to Elect to the State
Duma” was written prior to the elections to the Second Duma. In the
article “The Government’s Falsification of the Duma and the Tasks of the
Social Democrats”, Lenin called this leaflet a poster “about the
three chief parties” which took part in the Duma elections. The
leaflet was printed in Vyborg by the editorial hoard of Proletary as a
supplement to No. 5; it appeared in three editions (one in full and two
abridged) in St. Petersburg in 1906. In the abridged form it was also published
by the Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Kostroma and Kharkov committees of the R.S.D.L.P., by
the

Ob group 

of the R.S.D.L.P., the Central Committee of the Social-Democrats of
the Lettish Territory and the Central Committee of the Latvian
Social-Democrats.

When political strife assumes open forms to any extent, it is remarkable how
quickly and vividly events put every tactical step to the test. Even before many
of the delegates of the All-Russian Conference of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party have had time to return to their localities and
report to their
Party organisations, a totally new light has been thrown on the vexed question
of blocs with the Cadets, which is now the central political
question of the day.


At the Conference of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party it never
occurred to any delegate that the Social-Democrats could even slightly weaken,
or modify in any way, their independent tactical slogans in the election
campaign. Formally, the corner-stone of the resolution submitted by the Central
Committee and adopted by 18 votes to 14 (the Bolsheviks, Poles and Letts) was
the complete independence of the platform and slogans of the
R.S.D.L.P. Alliances of any permanence with other parties on the basis of any
“relaxation” whatsoever of our political platform were absolutely
prohibited. And the whole controversy between the Right and Left wings of the
Social-Democratic Party. revolved around the questions: “Are the
Right-wing Social-Democrats adhering to this principle in actual practice? Are
they not violating it by sanctioning blocs with the Cadets? Is not the
distinction between ’technical’ and ideological agreements artificial,
fictitious and merely a verbal one?”


But ... apparently, in our Party too, i.e., in its actual
“constitution”, there is an institution of the nature of a Senate;
by means of Senate interpretations, there is a possibility of Party
“laws”, decisions of official Party bodies, being

    

turned into their very opposite. The new Senate interpretation of the decisions
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party came, as might have been
expected, from Geneva. It was published in the Cadet newspaper
Tovarishch in the form of “An Open
Answer”[3]

(just
like Lassalle!) by G. Plekhanov to a reader of that paper “who does not
consider him self either a bourgeois or a Social-Democrat”. Our Party
quasi-Lassalle hurries to the assistance of the reader of a news paper which is
virtually the organ of the renegades of Social-Democracy.


The reader of Tovarishch asked G. Plekhanov, among other things,
“what, in his opinion, could serve as a joint election platform of the
Left and extreme Left parties”. G. Plekhanov answered: “To this
question there can be no other answer than: a Duma with full power.”


“There can be no other answer”.... These words of our quasi-Lassalle
are probably fated to become “historic”, at least in the Gogol sense
of the term. Plekhanov condescend ed once to listen to a report in which it was
stated that there was a certain Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party, that some sort of an All-Russian Conference of that
Party was being convened, and that both the Central Committee and that
Conference were drawing up a reply to questions which are of interest not only
to Madame Kuskova and Mr. Prokopovich, Plekhanov’s present colleagues, but also
to the socialist workers of Russia. Not in the least disturbed by this,
G. Plekhanov proclaims:

“There can be no other answer than mine.” And these high and
mighty words are published in a Cadet newspaper at a time when the whole reading
public of Russia already knows of another answer, given by all
the representatives both of the regional bodies and of the central body of the
whole Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.


Verily, this is a “history” of the sort that
Nozdrev[4]

was so often
the hero of.


However, let us get to the point of this unique and inimit able answer of our
inimitable G. Plekhanov.


First of all we note that he cannot even conceive of the possibility of
agreements at the first stage without a joint election platform. We Bolsheviks
find this opinion greatly to our liking. By this admission, Plekhanov has done
the

    

Mensheviks a disservice. We have repeatedly pointed out, at the Conference, in
      controversy with the Mensheviks and Bundists, and also in No. 8 of

 Proletary,[1]

that agreements at the first stage will inevitably
    affect our Party position in coming before the masses and that
    consequently, whatever our desires and plans may be, such agreements will
    inevitably acquire the colouring of a certain ideological
    rapprochement, and will in some measure obscure, diminish and blunt
    the political independence of the Social-Democratic Party.

G. Plekhanov, with his characteristic adroitness and party tact, has confirmed
our charges against the Mensheviks. In fact, he has gone even further than our
accusation by advocating a joint platform, i.e., a definite
ideological bloc with the Cadets.


It turns out that not only in the Russian state, but also in the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party, Senate interpretations discredit those for
whose benefit they are issued.


Further, let the reader ponder over the direct meaning of Plekhanov’s
“Cadet-Social-Democratic” slogan: “a Duma with full
power”—irrespective of the attitude of the different parties towards
it. The words “a Duma with full power” signify a demand for full
power for the Duma. Which Duma? Evidently, the one to which Russian citizens
will now elect deputies on the basis of the Law of December 11 and the Senate
interpretations. For this Duma, G. Plekhanov proposes to demand full
power. Evidently, he is convinced that this Duma will not be a Black-Hundred
Duma, for he could not demand full power for a Black-Hundred Duma. To issue the
slogan of “a Duma with full power” and at the same time to shout
about the serious danger of a Black-Hundred Duma, is to defeat one’s own
case. It is tantamount to confirming the opinion of the Bolsheviks that there is
really no serious danger of a Black-Hundred Duma being elected, and that the
Cadets are either inventing or in some cases exaggerating this danger for their
own selfish ends, namely, to shake the faith of the workers and of all
revolutionary democrats in their own strength, to free the Cadet Party of the
“danger from the Left” which is really threatening
it. Rech itself, the official organ of the Cadets, has acknowledged
that danger

    

in the report of the Cadets on the progress of the election campaign in
St. Petersburg Gubernia.


Let us pass on to the real political meaning of Plekhanov’s slogan. Its inventor
is in raptures over it. “This general formula,” he writes, “exactly
expresses in algebraic form the political task that is most urgent today for the
Lefts and the extreme Lefts”, while allowing them to preserve all their
other demands absolutely intact. “The Cadets’ conception of a Duma with
full power cannot be the same as that of the Social-Democrats. But both need a
Duma with full power. Therefore, both must fight for it.”


It is clear from these words that Plekhanov is fully aware that this slogan is
bound to be understood differently by the Cadets and the Social-Democrats. The
slogan is the same, “common” to both, but the Cadets’
“conception” of this slogan cannot be the same as that of
the Social-Democrats.


In that case, what is the purpose of a common slogan? What is the use of
submitting slogans and platforms to the masses at all?


Is it only for the sake of appearances, to cover up some thing that should not
be explained to the masses, to perform behind the backs of the people a
parliamentary manoeuvre that promises all sorts of advantages? Or is it to raise
the class-consciousness of the masses and really explain to them their present
political tasks?


Everyone knows that bourgeois politicians always come forward with all sorts of
slogans, programmes, and platforms to deceive the people. Bourgeois politicians
always, especially before elections, call themselves liberals, progressives,
democrats and even “radical socialists” solely for the
purpose of catching votes and deceiving the people. This is a universal
phenomenon in all capitalist countries. That is why Marx and Engels even
referred to bourgeois deputies as people

“die das Volk vertreten und
zertreten”, i. e., who represent and repress the people through
their parliamentary powers.[5]


And here we have the “veteran” Russian Social-Democrat, the founder
of Social-Democracy, proposing a platform for the first general Party election
campaign which it is known will be interpreted by the Cadets in one way and by
the Social-Democrats in another! What does it all mean?

 

If the Cadets and the Social-Democrats cannot have the same conception of a Duma
      with full power, neither can the broad masses of the people, for the
      Cadets and the Social-Democrats represent the interests of certain
      classes, their strivings and prejudices. Evidently, Plekhanov regards the
      Cadets’ conception of a Duma with full power as wrong, and all wrong
      conceptions of political aims are harmful to the people. Consequently,
      Plekhanov is advancing a slogan in a form that is known to be
    harmful to the people, for it leaves a wrong conception unexplained and
    concealed. To put it simply and bluntly, this means deceiving the workers
    and the whole people for the sake of an appearance of unity between the
    Cadets and the Social-Democrats.


What is wrong with the Cadets’ conception of a Duma with full power? Plekhanov
does not say. This silence proves, firstly, that Plekhanov is using the election
campaign (the presentation of an election platform is a step in the election
campaign) not to clarify the minds of the people but to obscure them. Secondly,
it takes away all meaning from Plekhanov’s conclusion that “both the
Cadets and the Social-Democrats need a Duma with full power”. This is
sheer non sense concealed by verbal trickery: two different parties need the
same thing, which each conceives of differently! Which means that it is not the
same thing: the first comer will convict Plekhanov here of a logical
blunder. We might as well symbolise both an autocratic monarchy and a democratic
republic with the letter “a” and say that different parties are free
to substitute different arithmetical values in this general algebraic
formula. That would be typical Plekhanov logic, or rather Plekhanov sophistry.


As a matter of fact, Plekhanov utters a downright falsehood when he
says that both the Cadets and the Social-Democrats need a Duma with full power
or, what is more, a popular representative assembly with full power, which he
discusses all through the second part of his article. A popular representative
assembly with full power is a constituent assembly; moreover it is a
constituent assembly not side by side with the monarch, but after the
overthrow of the tsarist government. If Plekhanov has forgotten this simple
truth, we advise him to read the Programme of the Russian Social-Democratic

    

Labour Party, especially the last paragraph, which deals with this
very point.


The Cadets do not need such a popular representative assembly with really full
power; it would be dangerous for them and fatal to the interests they
represent. It would exclude the monarchy, so dear to their hearts and valuable
for their bourgeois pockets. It would deprive them of their hope of redemption
payments for the landlords’ lands. All this is so true that even
Plekhanov, in No. 6 of his Dnevnik, speaks of the Cadet’s selfish class
distrust of the idea of a constituent assembly and says that, fearing a
constituent assembly, the Cadets are making peace with the Stolypin
gang.


We already quoted these passages from Plekhanov’s Dnevnik, No. 6, in
No. 8 of

 Proletary,[2]

and pointed out that Plekhanov must now withdraw
the statements he made but yesterday. His phrase “the Cadets also need a
Duma with full power” is just such a withdrawal of his own words.


Plekhanov’s main falsehood logically and inevitably leads to a number
of others. It is false to say that a “popular representative
assembly with full power is in itself a preliminary condition for the
achievement of all the other ... demands of all the progressive parties”,
that “without it, not one of these demands will be achieved”, that
the struggle of the Lefts and extreme Lefts will begin only when “it [the
popular representative assembly with full power] becomes a fact”. A
popular representative assembly with full power is the culmination of the
revolution, its final and complete victory. But the Cadets want to halt the
revolution, to put a stop to it by small concessions, and they say so openly. By
trying to make the workers and the whole people believe that the Cadets are
capable of fighting for the complete victory of the revolution, Plekhanov is
thrice deceiving the masses of the people.


“So far we have only a Mr. Stolypin with full power,” writes Plekhanov. We
do not know whether this is a slip of the pen, or another example of false Cadet
language (“a Duma with full power = a tsarist Duma with Ministers

    

appointed by the tsar from the Duma majority”), or a ruse to escape the censor,
      Far from having full power, Stolypin is just an insignificant lackey of
      the tsar and of the tsar’s Black-Hundred Court gang. If the pogrom
      disclosures in the Duma have not convinced Plekhanov of this, let him read
      what the liberal newspapers say bout the all-powerful influence of the
      Union of the Russian People.


“Now,” says Plekhanov, “the Left and the extreme Left parties must
join forces against those who do not want a popular representative assembly with
full power, or, perhaps, any popular representative assembly at all.”


Consequently, they must oppose the Cadets, who do not want a popular
representative assembly with full power.


Plekhanov scored nicely against himself when, ostensibly combating
doctrinairism, he set us n example of the worst Jesuitical doctrinairism. From
the standpoint of their group, the Bolsheviks could rejoice at his performance,
for a stronger blow at Menshevik tactics could hardly be imagined. As members
of the united Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, however, we feel ashamed
of it.


The official organ of the Cadets, Rech, answered Plekhanov in a way
that will, perhaps, cure even the tamest Social-Democrats of their opportunist
illusions. Its first reply, a leading article in issue No. 226, of November 25,
consists entirely of mockery over Plekhanov’s proffered hand, and it is the
mockery of a liberal who has not forgotten the attacks that Plekhanov and his
Iskra colleagues made on the opportunism of the liberals. “In
this case too,” says the Cadet organ, jeering at Plekhanov,
“Mr. Plekhanov is making highly commendable and praiseworthy efforts to
move his colleagues a little to the Right of the most Right positions they
occupy.” Nevertheless ... we must object.


The Cadet’s objections are the type of answer that a factory owner would give to
a worker who has come to beg some thing of him after dissociating himself from
his fellow-workers who are making a joint demand backed by a strike. You come
to me asking for a favour? Good. But what use are you to me if your unreasonable
colleagues do not follow your example? What use are you to me if you do not go
all the way? A Duma with full power? Well, well! Do you think I am going to
discredit myself in the eyes of the people who

    

stand for law and order? You must say: a Cabinet. consisting of members of the
Duma majority. Then we shall agree to a joint platform with the
Social-Democrats!


Such is the gist of the reply in Rech, which is studded with subtle
ridicule both of Plekhanov’s

naive 

“algebra” and of the fact that
he, in November 1904, was a member of the leading body of the Social-Democrats
(Plekhanov was then a member of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and
chairman of the Supreme “Council” of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party), the body which rejected the “famous Paris
agreement”[6]

with the bourgeois democrats. At that time we had an “algebraic
symbol”, namely, “a democratic regime”, says Rech,
ironically. By that we meant a constitutional monarchy. The
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who agreed to the pact, meant a democratic
republic. You refused then, Mr. G. V. Plekhanov. Have you now grown wiser? We
Cadets commend you for it, but if you want to talk business, you must
go farther to the right.


And Rech openly admits that the Cadets were also leading the people by
the nose with the slogan of a “constituent assembly”. We Cadets
wanted a constituent assembly “with the preservation of the
prerogatives of the monarch”, and not a republican constituent
assembly. It was to our advantage to attract the sympathies of the masses by
means of this deception, but now it is more important for us to win the sympathy
of the tsarist gang. Therefore, away with this “dangerous”,
“ambiguous” and “hopeless” slogan of “a Duma with
full power”, which “panders to pernicious revolutionary
illusions”. We demand that the Social-Democrats stick to their former,
Central Committee slogan: support for a Cabinet consisting of members of the
Duma majority. “with all the consequences” that follow from
it. And these consequences are, not to weaken, but to strengthen
(sic!) the Cadet majority in the Duma.


In the next issue of the Rech the editorial specially explains to the
tsar’s Black-Hundred gang (ostensibly explaining the question to Plekhanov) that
the Cadets do not need a Duma “with full power”. To
proclaim the Duma as having full power means a coup d’état. The Cadets will
never agree to that. “We Cadets are not at all striving for a Duma with
full power, nor are we obliged to do so.” “Has Mr. Plekhanov,

    

in spite of his usual perspicacity, failed to learn” this lesson
      “from the course of events”?


Yes, the Cadets’ jeer at Plekhanov’s usual perspicacity hit the nail on the
head. The whole course of events of the Russian revolution has failed to teach
Plekhanov to understand the Cadets. He has received a well-merited punishment
in that the Cadets have scornfully rejected the hand proffered by a
Social-Democrat acting independently of his Party and contrary to its wishes.


The reply Rech gave to Plekhanov is also of general political
importance. The Cadets are swiftly moving to the Right. They do not hesitate to
say that they will come to terms with the Black-Hundred monarchy and destroy
“pernicious revolutionary illusions”.


The workers of the whole of Russia will, we feel sure, turn this lesson to good
account. Instead of entering into blocs with the Cadets they will wage an
independent election campaign, win over the revolutionary bourgeoisie and sweep
aside into the slough of political treachery the whole gang of bourgeois
politicians who are deceiving the people with phrase-mongering about
“people’s freedom”.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Crisis of Menshevism



The advocacy of a non-party labour congress and blocs with the Cadets is
undoubtedly a sign of something in the nature of a crisis in the tactics of the
Mensheviks. Being opposed on principle to all their tactics in general, we, of
course, could not ourselves decide whether this crisis had ripened sufficiently
to break out on the surface, so to speak. Comrade Y. Larin has come to our
assistance in his latest and most instructive pamphlet: A Broad Labour Party
and a Labour Congress (Moscow, 1906, book depot of Novy
Mir Publishers).


Comrade Y. Larin often speaks in the name of the majority of the Mensheviks. He
styles himself—and with full right—a responsible representative of
Menshevism. He has worked both in the South and in the most
“Menshevik” district of St. Petersburg, Vyborg District. He was a
delegate to the Unity Congress. He was a regular contributor to Golos
Truda and Otkliki Sovremennosti. All these facts are extremely
important in forming an opinion of the pamphlet, the value of which lies in the
author’s veracity, but not in his logic; in the information he supplies, but not
in his arguments.

I

A Marxist must base his arguments on tactics on an analysis of the objective
course of the revolution. The Bolsheviks, as we know, made an attempt to do so
in the resolution on the present situation which they submitted to the
Unity Congress.[1]

The Mensheviks withdrew their own resolution on this subject. Comrade
Larin evidently feels that such questions must not be shelved and he makes an attempt to trace the course of
      our bourgeois revolution.


He divides it into two periods. The first, covering the whole of 1905, is the
period of the open mass movement. The second, starting with 1906, is the period
of agonisingly slow preparation for the “actual triumph of the cause of
liberty”, “the realisation of the aspirations of the
people”. In this period of preparation the countryside is the decisive
factor; because its aid was not forthcoming the “disunited cities were
crushed”. We are experiencing “an internal, outwardly
passive-seeming, growth of the revolution”.


“What is called the agrarian movement—the constant ferment which does
not develop into widespread attempts at an active offensive, the minor struggles
with the local authorities and landlords, the suspension of tax payments,
punitive expeditions—all this constitutes the course most advantageous to
the peasantry, not from the point of view of economising forces, perhaps, which
is doubtful, but from the point of view of results. Without completely
exhausting the rural population, bringing it, on the whole, more alleviation
than defeats, it is seriously sapping the foundations of the old regime and
creating conditions that must inevitably compel it to capitulate, or fall, at
the first serious test, when the time comes.” And the author points out that in
two or three years’ time there will be a change in the personnel of the police
force and the army, which will be replenished with recruits from the
discontented rural population; “our sons will be among the
soldiers”, as a peasant told the author.


Comrade Larin draws two conclusions.

(1) In our country “unrest in the
countryside cannot subside. The Austrian 1848 cannot be repeated here.”

(2) “The Russian revolution is not taking the course of an armed uprising of the
people in the real sense of the term, like the American or Polish revolutions.”


Let us consider these conclusions. The author’s grounds for the first are too
sketchy and his formulation of it too inexact. But in substance, he is not far
from the truth. The outcome of our revolution will actually depend most of all
on the steadfastness in struggle of the millions of peasants.


Our big bourgeoisie is far more afraid of revolution than of reaction. The
proletariat, by itself, is not strong enough to win. The urban poor do not
represent any independent interests, they are not an independent force compared
with the proletariat and peasantry. The rural population has the decisive role,
not in the sense of leading the struggle (this is out of the question), but in
the sense of being able to ensure victory.


If Comrade Larin had properly thought out his conclusion and had linked it up
with the whole course of development of Social-Democratic ideas on our
bourgeois revolution, he would have found himself confronted with an old
proposition of the Bolshevism that he hates so much: the victorious outcome of the
bourgeois revolution in Russia is possible only in the form of a
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. In
effect, Larin has arrived at the same point of view. The only thing that
prevents him from admitting it openly is that Menshevik quality which he himself
castigates, namely: hesitant and timid thinking. One need only compare Larin’s
arguments on this subject with those of the Central Committee’s
Sotsial-Demokrat to be convinced that Larin has come close to the
Bolsheviks on this question. Sotsial-Demokrat went to the length of
saying that the Cadets are the urban, non-Estate, progressive bourgeoisie, while
the Trudoviks are the rural, Estate, non-progressive bourgeoisie!
Sotsial-Demokrat failed to notice the landlords and
counter-revolutionary bourgeois among the Cadets, failed to notice the
non-Estate, urban democrats (the lower strata of the urban poor) among the
Trudoviks!


To proceed. Larin says that unrest in the countryside can not subside. Has he
proved it? No. He has entirely left out of account the role of the peasant
bourgeoisie, which is being systematically bribed by the government. He has
given little thought also to the fact that the “alleviations”
obtained by the peasantry (lower rents, “curtailment” of the rights
and powers of the landlords and the police, etc.) are intensifying the
break-up of the rural population into the counter-revolutionary rich and a mass
of poor. Such sweeping generalisations must not be made with such scanty
evidence. The sound trite.


But can the proposition that “unrest in the countryside cannot
      subside” be proved? Yes and no.

Yes—in the sense that one can
      make a thorough analysis of probable developments.

No—in the sense
      that one cannot be absolutely certain of these developments in the present
      bourgeois revolution. One cannot weigh with apothecary’s scales the
      equilibrium between the new forces of counter-revolution and revolution
      which are growing and becoming interwoven in the
      countryside. Experience alone will completely reveal
    this. Revolution, in the narrow sense of the term, is an acute struggle, and
    only in the course of the struggle and in its outcome is the real strength
    of all the interests, aspirations and potentialities displayed and fully
    recognised.


The task of the advanced class in the revolution is to ascertain correctly the
trend of the struggle, to make the most of all opportunities,
all chances of victory. This class must be the first to take
the direct revolutionary path and the last to abandon it for more
“prosaic”, more “circuitous” paths. Comrade Larin has
failed to understand this truth, although he argues at great length and (as we
shall see below) not at all cleverly about spontaneous outbursts and planned
action.


Let us pass to his second conclusion—concerning an armed uprising. Here
Larin is even more guilty of timid thinking. His thoughts slavishly follow the
old models: the North American and Polish uprisings. Apart from these, he
refuses to recognise any uprising “in the real sense of the term”. He
even says that our revolution is not proceeding on the lines of a
“formal” (!) and “regular” (!!) armed uprising.


How curious: a Menshevik who won his spurs in a fight against formalism is now
talking about a formal armed uprising! If your thoughts are so crushed by the
formal and the regular, you have only yourself to blame, Comrade Larin. The
Bolsheviks have always taken a different view of the matter. Long before the
uprising, at the Third Congress, i.e., in the spring of 1905, they emphasised in
a special resolution the connection between the mass strike and an
uprising.[2]

The Mensheviks prefer to ignore this. It is in vain. The
resolution of the Third Congress is actual proof


that we foresaw as closely as was possible the specific features of the
people’s struggle at the end of 1905. And we did not by any means conceive the
uprising as being of “the type” of North America or Poland, where a
mass strike would have been out of the question.


Then,after December, we pointed out (in our draft resolution for the
Unity Congress[3])

the change in the relation of the strike to the uprising, the role
of the peasantry and the army, the inadequacy of local outbreaks in the armed
forces and the necessity of reaching an agreement with the
revolutionary-democratic elements among the troops.


And events proved once again, in the course of the Duma period, the
inevitability of an uprising in the Russian struggle for emancipation.


Larin’s arguments about a formal uprising display an ignorance of the history
of the present revolution, or a disregard for this history and its specific
forms of insurrection, that is most unbecoming for a Social-Democrat. Larin’s
thesis: “The Russian revolution is not taking the course of an
uprising” shows contempt for the facts, for both periods of civil
liberties in Russia (the October and the Duma periods) were in fact marked by a
“course” of uprisings, not of the American or Polish type, of
course, but one characteristic of twentieth-century Russia. By arguing “in
general” about historical examples of uprisings in countries where rural
or urban elements predominated, about America and Poland, and refusing to make
the least attempt to study or even note the specific features of the uprising in
Russia, Larin repeats the cardinal error of the “hesitant and timid”
thinking of the Mensheviks.


Look deeper into his structure of “passive” revolution. Undoubtedly,
there may be long periods of preparation for a new upsurge, a new onslaught, or
new forms of struggle. But don’t be doctrinaire, gentlemen; consider what this
“constant ferment” in the countryside means in addition to
the “minor struggles”, the “punitive expeditions” and
the change in the personnel of the police force and troops! Why, you
do not understand what you yourselves are saying. The situation you describe is
nothing more nor less than protract ed guerrilla warfare, interspersed
with a series of outbursts of revolt in the army of increasing
magnitude and unity,


You keep on using angry and abusive language about the “guerrilla
      fighters”, “anarchists”, “anarcho-Blanquist-Bolsheviks”, and
      so forth, yet you yourselves depict the revolution as the Bolsheviks
      do! Change in the personnel of the army, its remanning with
      “recruits from the discontented rural population”. What does
      this mean? Can this “discontent” of the rural population
      clothed a sailors’ jackets and soldiers’ uniforms fail to come to the
      surface? Can it fail to manifest itself when there is “constant
      ferment” in the soldiers’ native villages, when “minor
      struggles” on one side and “punitive expeditions” on the
      other are raging in the country? And can we, in this period of
      Black-Hundred pogroms, government violence and police outrages, conceive
      of any other manifestation of this discontent among the soldiers
    than military revolts?


While repeating Cadet phrases (“our revolution is not taking the course of
an uprising”; this phrase was put into circulation by the Cadets
at the end of 1905; see Milyukov’s Narodnaya Svoboda[4]),

you at the same time show that a new uprising is inevitable; “the regime
will collapse at the first serious test”. Do you think that a serious test
of the regime is possible in a broad, heterogeneous, complex, popular movement
without a preliminary series of less important, partial tests; that a general
strike is possible without a series of local strikes; that a general uprising
is possible with out a series of sporadic, minor, non-general uprisings?


If recruits from the discontented rural population are increasing in the armed
forces, and if the revolution as a whole is advancing, then insurrection is
inevitable in the form of extremely bitter struggle against the
Black-Hundred troops (for the Black Hundreds are also organising and training
themselves, do not forget this! Do not forget that there are social elements
which foster Black-Hundred mentality!), a struggle both of the people and of a
section of the armed forces. So it is necessary to get ready, to prepare the
masses and to prepare ourselves, for a more systematic, united and aggressive
uprising—that is the conclusion that follows from Larin’s premises, from
his Cadet fairy-tale about passive (??) revolution. Larin admits that
the Mensheviks “put the blame for their own melancholy and despondency on
the course of the Russian revolution” (p. 58). Exactly!


Passivity is the quality of the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, not of the
revolution. Those are passive who admit that the army is being filled with
recruits from the discontent ed rural population, that constant ferment and
minor struggles are inevitable, and yet, with the complacency of Ivan
Fyodorovich Shponka,[5]

console the workers’ party with
the statement: “the Russian revolution is not taking the course of an
uprising”.


But what about the “minor struggles”? You, my dear Larin, think that they
are the “course most advantageous to the peasantry from the point of view
of results”? You maintain this opinion in spite of the punitive expeditions,
and even include the latter in the most advantageous course? But have you given
even the slightest thought to what distinguishes this minor struggle from
guerrilla warfare? Nothing, esteemed Comrade Larin.


In your preoccupation with the ill-chosen examples of America and Poland you
have overlooked the specific forms of struggle engendered by the Russian
uprising, which is more protracted, more stubborn and has longer intervals
between big battles than uprisings of the old type.


Comrade Larin has become completely confused, and his conclusions are all at
sixes and sevens. If there are grounds for revolution in the countryside, if the
revolution is expanding and drawing in new forces, if the army is being filled
with discontented peasants, and if continual ferment and minor struggles persist
in the countryside, then the Bolsheviks are right in their fight against
shelving the question of an uprising. We do not advocate an uprising at all
times and under all circumstances. But we do demand that the thoughts of a
Social-Democrat should not be hesitant and timid, If you admit that the
conditions for an uprising exist, then recognise the uprising itself
and the special tasks that confront the Party in connection with it.


To call minor struggles “the most advantageous course”,
i. e., the most advantageous form of the struggle of the people in a specific
period of our revolution, and at the same time to refuse to admit that the Party
of the advanced class is confronted by active tasks which arise out of
this “most advantageous course”, reveals either inability to think
or dishonest thinking.

V. I.  

      Lenin
The Crisis of Menshevism



    

II

A “theory of passivity” is the term that might he applied to Larin’s
arguments about a “passive” revolution that is preparing the
“collapse of the old regime at,the first serious test”. And this
“theory of passivity”, a natural product of timid thinking, has left
its mark on the whole pamphlet of our penitent Menshevik. He asks: Why,
considering its enormous ideological influence, is our Party so weak
organisationally? It is not, he replies, because our Party is a party of
intellectuals. This old, “bureaucratic” (Larin’s expression)
explanation of the Mensheviks is quite worthless. Because, objectively, in the
present period there has been no need for a different kind of party, and the
objective conditions for a different kind of party have not existed. Because for
a “policy of spontaneous outbursts”, such as the policy of the
proletariat was at the beginning of the revolution, no party was needed. All
that was needed was a “technical apparatus to serve the spontaneous
movement” and “spontaneous moods”, to conduct propaganda and
agitational work in the intervals between revolutionary outbursts. This was not
a party in the European sense, hut “a narrow—120,000 out of nine
million—association of young working-class conspirators”; few
married men; the majority of the workers who are ready for public activities are
outside the Party.


Now the period of spontaneous outbursts is passing away. Calculation is taking
the place of mere temperament. In place of the “policy of spontaneous
outbursts”, a “policy of planned action” is arising. Now we
need “a party of the European type”, a “party of objectively
planned, political action”. In place of an
“apparatus—party” we need a

“van guard-party”, 

“that would be the rallying point for all those suitable for active
political life that the working class can produce from its ranks”. This is
the transition to a “European party based on calculated action”. The
“sound realism of European Social-Democracy” is taking the place of
“official Menshevism with its half-hearted and hesitating measures, its
despondency and failure to understand its own position”. “Its voice
has been making itself quite audible for some time now through Plekhanov and
Axelrod—strictly speaking the only Europeans in our ’barbarian’
environment....” And, of

    

course, the substitution of Europeanism for barbarism promises success in place
of failure. “Wherever spontaneity prevails, mistakes in judgement and
failures in practice are inevitable.” “Where there is spontaneity, there
is utopianism; where there is utopianism, there is failure.”


In these arguments of Larin’s we see again the glaring discrepancy between the
tiny kernel of a correct, although not new, idea, and the enormous husk of sheer
reactionary incomprehension. A spoonful of honey in a barrel of tar.


It is an unquestionable and indisputable fact that as capitalism develops, as
experience of bourgeois revolution or revolutions, and also of abortive
socialist revolutions, accumulates, the working class of all countries grows,
develops, learns, becomes trained and organised. In other words: it advances from
spontaneity to planned action, from being guided merely by mood to guidance by
the objective position of all classes, from outbursts to sustained
struggle. All this is true. It is as old as the hills, and is as applicable to
Russia of the twentieth century as to England of the seventeenth century, to
France of the thirties of the nineteenth century, and to Germany at the close of
the nineteenth century.


But the trouble with Larin is that he is quite incapable of digesting the
materials which our revolution provides the Social-Democrat. Like a child with a
new toy, he is entirely taken up with contrasting the outbursts of Russian
barbarism with European planned activity. Uttering a truism that applies to all
periods in general, he does not understand that his naive application of this
truism to a period of direct revolutionary struggle becomes with him a
renegade attitude towards the revolution. This would be tragicomical,
if it were not that Larin’s sincerity left no shadow of doubt that he is
unconsciously echoing the renegades of the revolution.


Spontaneous outbursts of barbarians, planned activity of the Europeans.... This
is a purely Cadet formula and a Cadet idea, the idea of the traitors to the
Russian revolution, who go into raptures over “constitutionalism”
like Muromtsev, who declared: “The Duma is part of the government”,
or the lackey Rodichev, who exclaimed: “It is presumption to hold the
monarch responsible for the pogrom.” The Cadets have created a whole literature
written by renegades (the

    

Izgoyevs, Struves, Prokopoviches, Portugalovs, et tutti quanti) who
    have reviled the folly of spontaneity, i.e., revolution. The
    liberal bourgeois, like the famous animal in the fable, is simply unable to
    lift his eyes and understand that it is only due to the
    “outbursts” of the people that we still possess even a shadow of
    liberty.


And Larin, naively uncritical, trails behind the liberals. Larin does not
understand that there are two sides to the question he raises: (1) the contrast
between a spontaneous struggle and a planned struggle of the same dimensions and
forms, (2) the contrast between a revolutionary (in the narrow sense) period and
a counter-revolutionary or “only constitutional” period. Larin’s
logic is atrocious. He contrasts a spontaneous political strike not to a planned
political strike, but to planned participation in, let us say, the Bulygin
Duma. He contrasts a spontaneous uprising not to a planned uprising, but to
planned trade union activity. Consequently, his Marxist analysis is converted
into a flat and philistine apotheosis of counter-revolution.


European Social-Democracy is the “party of objectively planned political
activity”, prattles Larin ecstatically. Oh, child! He does not notice that
he is going into raptures over the particularly limited field of
“activity” to which the Europeans were compelled to confine
themselves in a period when there was no directly revolutionary struggle. He
does not notice that he is going into raptures over the planned nature of a
struggle waged within legal limits and decrying the spontaneity of a
struggle for the power and authority which determine the limits of what
is “legal”. He compares the spontaneous uprising of the Russians in
December 1905, not with the “planned” uprisings of the Germans in
1849 and of the French in 1871, but with the planned growth of the German trade
unions. He compares the spontaneous and unsuccessful general strike of the
Russians in December 1905, not with the “planned” and
unsuccessful general strike of the Belgians in

 19O2,[1]

but with the
planned speeches of Bebel or Vandervelde in the Reichstag.


That is why Larin fails to understand the historic progress of the mass struggle
of the proletariat signalised by the strike in October 1905 and the uprising in
December 1905. Whereas the retrogression of the Russian revolution
(temporary, on

    

his own admission) expressed in the necessity of preparatory activity
within the limits of the law (trade unions, elections, etc.) he
elevates into progress from spontaneous to planned activity, from moods
to calculation, etc.


That is why, in place of the moral drawn by a revolutionary Marxist (that
instead of a spontaneous political strike we must have a planned political
strike, instead of a spontaneous uprising we must have a planned uprising), we
find the moral drawn by a renegade-Cadet (instead of the “folly of
spontaneity”—strikes and uprisings—we must have systematic
submission to the Stolypin laws and a planned deal with the Black-Hundred
monarchy).


No, Comrade Larin, if you had mastered the spirit of Marxism, and not merely
its language, you would know the difference between revolutionary dialectical
materialism and the opportunism of “objective” historians. Recall,
for instance, what Marx said about Proudhon. A Marxist does not renounce the
struggle within the limits of the law, peaceful parliamentarism and
“planned” compliance with the limits of historical activity set by
the Bismarcks and the Bennigsens, the Stolypins and the Milyukovs. But a
Marxist, while utilising every field, even a reactionary one, for the
fight for the revolution, does not stoop to glorifying reaction, does not forget
to fight for the best possible field of activity. Therefore, the
Marxist is the first to foresee the approach of a revolutionary period,
and already begins to rouse the people and to sound the tocsin while the
philistines are still wrapt in the slavish slumber of loyal subjects. The Marxist is
therefore the first to take the path of direct revolutionary struggle,
marching straight to battle and exposing the illusions of conciliation
cherished by all kinds of social and political vacillators. Therefore, the
Marxist is the last to leave the path of directly revolutionary
struggle, he leaves it only when all possibilities have been exhausted, when
there is not a shadow of hope for a shorter way, when the basis for an
appeal to prepare for mass strikes, an uprising, etc., is obviously
disappearing. Therefore, a Marxist treats with contempt the innumerable
renegades of the revolution who shout to him: We are more
“progressive” than you, we were the first to renounce the
revolution! We were the first to “submit” to the monarchist
constitution!

 

One of two things, Comrade Larin. Do you believe that there is already no basis
      for an uprising or for revolution in the narrow sense of the word? If you
      do, say so openly and prove it in the Marxist way, by an economic
      analysis, by an appraisal of the political strivings of the various
      classes, by an analysis of the significance of the different ideological
      trends. You have proved it? In that case, we declare that all talk about
      an uprising is mere phrase-mongering. In that case we shall say: what we
    had was not a great revolution, but a great bark without a
    bite. Workers! the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie (including the
    peasants) have betrayed and forsaken you. But, on the basis they
    have created in spite of our efforts, we shall work persistently,
    patiently, and consistently for a socialist revolution, which will
    not be so half-hearted and wretched, so rich in words and poor in deeds as
    the bourgeois revolution!


Or do you really believe what you say, Comrade Larin? Do you believe that the
tide of revolution is rising, that the minor struggles and the sullen discontent
will in a matter of two or three years create a new discontented army and a new
“serious test”; that “unrest in the countryside cannot
subside”? If so, then you must admit that the “out bursts” express
the strength of the people’s anger, and not the strength of backward
barbarism—that it is our duty to transform a spontaneous uprising into a
planned uprising, and to work persistently and stubbornly for many months,
perhaps years, to bring this about, and not to renounce an uprising, as all the
Judases are doing.


Your present position, however, Comrade Larin, is precisely one of
“melancholy and despondency”, of “hesitant and timid
thinking”, of putting the blame for your own passivity on our revolution.


This, and this alone, is implied by your jubilant declaration that the boycott
was a mistake. It is a short-sighted and vulgar jubilation. If it is
“progressive” to renounce the boycott, then the most progressive
people of all are the Right-wing Cadets of Russkiye Vedomosti, who
fought against the boycott of the Bulygin Duma and called on the students
“to go on with their studies and not meddle with rebellion”. We do
not envy this renegade progressiveness. We think that to say that it was a
“mistake” to boycott the Witte

    

Duma (which three or four months before its convocation nobody believed would be
convened) and to be silent about the mistake of those who called for
participation in the Bulygin Duma, means substituting for the materialism of a
revolutionary fighter the “objectivism” of a professor who is
cringing to reaction. We think that the position of those who were the
last to enter the Duma, to take the roundabout way, after trying really
everything on the direct path of struggle, is better than that of those
who were the first to call for entering the Bulygin Duma on the eve of the
popular uprising which swept it away.


This Cadet phrase about the boycott having been a mistake is particularly
unpardonable in Larin’s case since he truthfully relates that the
Mensheviks

“invented all kinds of shrewd and cunning tricks, ranging
from the elective principle and the Zemstvo campaign to uniting the Party by
participating in the elections with the object of boycotting the
Duma” (57). The Mensheviks called upon the workers to elect members
to the Duma, although they themselves did not believe that it was right to go
into the Duma. Were not the tactics of those more correct, who, not believing
this, boycotted the Duma; who declared that to call the Duma a
“power” (as the Mensheviks called it in their resolution at the
Unity Congress, before Muromtsev did so) meant deceiving the people; who entered
the Duma only after the bourgeoisie had deserted the direct path of boycott and
compelled us to take a circuitous route, though not for the same purpose, and
not in the same way, as the Cadets?

 

Notes
 
 



[1]

The Belgian general strike was declared in
April 1902 in support of the demand for universal suffrage raised in the
    Belgian Parliament by representatives of the Labour, Liberal and
    Democratic Parties. More than 300,000 workers took part in the strike;
    demonstrations by workers occurred throughout the country. But after Parliament
    had rejected the electoral reform bill and troops bad fired on
    demonstrators, the opportunist Labour Party leadership (Vaudervelde and
    others) capitulated and, under pressure from their “allies” in
    the liberal-bourgeois camp, called off the general strike. The defeat of the
    Belgian working class in April 1902 was a lesson to the international labour
    movement. “The socialist proletariat,” wrote Iskra in No. 21
    of June 1, 1902, “will see the practical results that follow from
    opportunist tactics which sacrifice revolutionary principles in the hope of
    quick successes. The proletariat will have yet another proof that it will
    not he able to achieve its aim by any of the methods of political pressure
    used against t.he enemy unless it is prepared to carry these methods to
    their logical conclusion.”

Lenin: 1906/crimensh: III







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Crisis of Menshevism



    

III

The contrast which Larin draws between an apparatus-party and a vanguard-party,
or, in other words, between a party of fighters against the police and a party
of class-conscious political fighters, seems profound and permeated with the
“pure proletarian” spirit. In actual fact, however, it is the very
same intellectualist opportunism as the analogous contrast drawn in 1899-1901 by
the supporters of Rabochaya Mysl and the Akimovites.[4]


On the one hand, when there are objective conditions for a direct revolutionary
onslaught by the masses, the

    

Party’s supreme political task is “to serve the spontaneous
    movement”. To contrast such revolutionary work with
    “politics” is to reduce politics to chicanery. It means
    exalting political action in the Duma above the political action of the
    masses in October and December; in other words, it means abandoning the
    proletarian revolutionary standpoint for that of intellectualist opportunism.


Every form of struggle requires a corresponding technique and a corresponding
apparatus. When objective conditions make the parliamentary struggle the
principal form of struggle, the features of the apparatus for parliamentary
struggle inevitably become more marked in the Party. When, on the other hand,
objective conditions give rise to a struggle of the masses in the form of mass
political strikes and uprisings, the party of the proletariat must
have an “apparatus” to “serve” these forms of
struggle, and, of course, this must be a special “apparatus”, not
resembling the parliamentary one. An organised party of the proletariat which
admitted that the conditions existed for popular uprisings and yet failed to set
up the necessary apparatus would be a party of intellectualist chatterboxes;
the workers would abandon it and go over to anarchism, bourgeois revolutionism,
etc.


On the other hand, the composition of the politically guiding vanguard of every
class, the proletariat included, also depends both on the position of this class
and on the principal form of its struggle. Larin complains, for example, that
young workers predominate in our Party, that we have few married workers, and
that they leave the Party. This complaint of a Russian opportunist reminds me of
a passage in one of Engels’s works (I think it is in The Housing Question,
Zur Wohnungsfrage). Retorting to some fatuous bourgeois professor, a
German Cadet, Engels wrote: is it not natural that youth should predominate in
our Party, the revolutionary party? We are the party of the future, and the
future belongs to the youth. We are a party of innovators, and it is always the
youth that most eagerly follows the innovators. We are a party that is waging a
self-sacrificing struggle against the old rottenness, and youth is always the
first to undertake a self-sacrificing struggle.


No, let us leave it to the Cadets to collect the “tired” old men of
thirty, revolutionaries who have “grown wise”, and

    

renegades from Social-Democracy. We shall, always be a party of the youth of the
advanced class!


Larin himself blurts out a frank admission why he regrets the loss of the
married men who are tired of the struggle. If we were to collect a good number
of these tired men into the Party, that would make it “somewhat sluggish,
putting a brake on political adventures” (p. 18).


Now, that’s better,, good Larin! Why dissemble and deceive yourself. What you
want is not a vanguard-party, but a rearguard-party, so that it will be
rather more sluggish. You should have said so frankly.


“... Putting a brake on political adventures....” Revolutions have been
defeated in Europe too; there were the June days of 1848 and the May days of
1871; but there has never been a Social-Democrat or a Communist who thought it
proper to declare the action of the masses in a revolution to be an
“adventure”. This became possible when among revolutionary Marxists
there were enrolled (not for long, we hope) spineless, craven Russian
philistines, called the “intelligentsia”, if you please, who have no
confidence in themselves and become despondent at every turn of events towards
reaction.


“...Putting a brake on adventures!” If that is so, then the first
adventurer is Larin himself; for he calls “minor
struggles” the course most advantageous to the revolution; he is
trying to make the masses believe that the tide of revolution is
rising, that in two or three years the army will be filled with
discontented peasants, and that the “old regime will collapse” at
“the first serious test”!


But Larin is an adventurer in another, much worse and pettier sense. He
advocates a labour congress and a “non party party” (his
expression!). Instead of the Social-Democratic Party he wants an
“All-Russian Labour Party”— “labour”, because it must
include the petty-bourgeois revolutionaries, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the
Polish Socialist Party, the Byelorussian Hromada,[5]

etc.


Larin is an admirer of Axelrod. But he has done him a disservice. He has so
exalted Axelrod’s “youthful energy”, his “true party
courage” in fighting for a labour congress, he has embraced him so
fervently, that ... he has smothered him in his embraces! Axelrod’s nebulous
“idea” of a labour

    

congress has been killed by a naive and truthful, practical party worker who has
      gone and blurted out everything that should have been concealed for
      successful advocacy of a labour congress. A labour congress means
      “taking down the signboard” (p. 20 in Larin’s pamphlet, for
      whom Social-Democracy is a mere signboard); it means merging with the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and the trade unions.


Quite right, Comrade Larin! Thank you at least for speaking the truth! The
labour congress really does mean all that. It would lead to that even against
the wish of its conveners. And it is just for that reason that a labour
congress now would be a petty opportunist adventure. Petty—for there is no
broad idea underlying it, nothing but the weariness of intellectuals who are
tired of the persistent struggle for Marxism. Opportunist—for the same
reason, and also because thousands of petty bourgeois of far from settled
opinions would be admitted into the labour party. An adventure—for under
present conditions such an attempt will bring about, not peace
or constructive work, or collaboration between the Socialist-Revolutionaries
and Social-Democrats— to whom Larin kindly assigns the role of
“propagandist societies within a broad party” (p. 40)—but only
endless aggravation of strife, dissension, splits, ideological confusion, and
actual disorganisation.


It is one thing to predict that the Socialist-Revolutionary “Centre”
must come over to the Social-Democrats when the Popular Socialists and
Maximalists drop

 out[1]

;

it is a different thing to climb after an apple which is
only in process of ripening, but is not yet ripe. You will either break your
neck, my dear sir, or upset your stomach with sour fruit.


Larin bases his arguments on “Belgium”, as did, in 1899, R. M. (the
editor of Rabochaya Mysl) and Mr. Prokopovich (when he was going
through the “spontaneous outbursts” of a Social-Democrat and had not
yet “grown wise” sufficiently to become a “systematically
acting” Cadet). Larin’s booklet has a neat appendix in the shape of a neat
translation of the Rules of the Belgian Labour Party! But our good Larin

    

forgot to “translate” to Russia the industrial conditions and
history of Belgium. After a series of bourgeois revolutions,
after decades of struggle against Proudhon’s petty-bourgeois
quasi-socialism, and with the enormous development of industrial
capitalism, possibly the highest in the world, the labour congress and the
labour party in Belgium marked a transition from non-proletarian socialism to
proletarian socialism. In Russia, at the height of a bourgeois revolution,
which is inevitably breeding petty-bourgeois ideas and petty-bourgeois
ideologists, and with growing “Trudovik” trends among closely
related sections of the peasantry and the proletariat, with a
Social-Democratic Labour Party that has a history of nearly one decade,
a labour congress is a badly conceived invention, and fusion with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries (who knows, there may be 30,000 of them, or perhaps
60,000, says Larin artlessly) is an intellectual’s whimsy.


Yes, history can be ironic! For years the Mensheviks have been trumpeting about
the close connection between the Bolsheviks and the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. And now the Bolsheviks reject a labour congress
precisely because it would obscure the difference in the points of view
of the proletarians and the small proprietors (see the resolution of the
St. Petersburg Committee[6]

in Proletary, No. 3). And
the Mensheviks stand for merging with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries in connection with the advocacy of a labour
congress. This is unique!


“I do not want to dissolve the party in the class,” pleads Larin. “I
only want to unite the vanguard, 900,000 out of nine million” (pp. 17 and
49).


Let us take the official factory returns for 1903. The total number of factory
workers was 1,640,406. Of these, 797,997 were in factories employing over 500
workers each, and 1,261,363 in factories employing over 100 workers each. The
number of workers in the largest factories (800,000) is only a little smaller
than the figure Larin gives for the workers’ party united with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries!


Thus, although we already have from 150,000 to 170,000 members in our
Social-Democratic Party, and notwithstanding the 800,000 workers employed in
large factories, the workers of big mining enterprises (not included in this
total)

    

and the multitude of purely proletarian elements employed in trade,
    agriculture, transport, etc., Larin has no hope that we in Russia can soon
    win for Social-Democracy 900,000 proletarians as Party members??
    Monstrous, but true.


But Larin’s lack of faith is only another example of the intellectual’s timid
thinking.


We are quite sure that this object can be attained. As a counterblast to the
adventure of a “labour congress” and a “non-party party”
we put forward the slogan: for a fivefold and tenfold increase of our
Social-Democratic Party, only let it consist mainly and almost
exclusively of purely proletarian elements, and let it be achieved
solely under the banner of revolutionary

       Marxism.[2]


Now, after a year of the great revolution, when all sorts of parties are growing
by leaps and bounds, the proletariat is becoming an independent party more
rapidly than ever. The Duma elections will assist this process (if we do not
enter into opportunist blocs with the Cadets, of course). The treachery of the
bourgeoisie in general, and of the petty bourgeoisie in particular (the
Popular Socialists), will strengthen the revolutionary
Social-Democratic Party.


We shall reach Larin’s “ideal” (900,000 Party members), and even
exceed it, by hard work on the present lines, and not by adventures. It is
certainly necessary now to enlarge the Party with the aid of
proletarian elements. It is abnormal that we should have only 6,000
Party members in St. Petersburg (in St. Petersburg Gubernia there are 81,000
workers in factories employing 500 workers and over; in all, 150,000 workers);
that in the Central Industrial Region we should have only 20,000 Party members
(377,000 workers in factories employing 500 and over; in all, 562,000 workers).

    

We must learn to

       recruit[3]

five times and ten times as many workers for
the Party in such centres. In this respect Larin is certainly quite right. But
we must not fall a prey to intellectualist cowardice or intellectualist
hysteria. We shall achieve our aim by following our own
Social-Democratic path, without plunging into adventures.

 

Notes

See pp. 199-200 of this volume.—Ed.

[2]

It would be unwise to take the trade unions into the Party, as Larin
proposes. This would only restrict the working-class movement and narrow
its base. We shall always be able to unite a far greater number of workers
for the struggle against the employers than for support of
Social-Democratic policy. Therefore (in spite of Larin’s wrong
assertion that the Bolsheviks have declared against non-party trade
unions), we stand for non-party trade unions, as the author of the
“Jacobin” (Jacobin—in the opinion of the opportunists) pamphlet
What Is To Be Done? advocated as far back as 1902. (See
present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 347-529.—Ed).—Lenin

[3]

We say “learn to recruit”, for the number of Social-Democratic
workers in such centres is undoubtedly many times the number of Party
members. We suffer from routine, we must fight against it. We must learn to
form, where necessary, lose Organisationen—looser, broader and
more accessible proletarian organisations. Our slogan is: for
a larger Social-Democratic Labour Party, against a non-party labour
congress and a non-party party!—Lenin
 



[4]

Rabochaya Mysl—an Economist group which
published the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’
Thought). It appeared
from October 1897 to December 1902, edited by K. M. Takhtarev and others.


The group advocated frankly opportunist views. It opposed the political struggle
of the working class and restricted the tasks of the working-class movement to
“the interests of the moment”, to demands for individual partial
reforms, chiefly of an economic nature. Glorifying “spontaneity” in
the working-class movement, it opposed the creation of an independent
proletarian party and belittled the importance of revolutionary theory and
class-consciousness, maintaining that socialist ideology could grow out of the
spontaneous movement.


The views of the Rabochaya Mysl group, as a Russian variety of
international opportunism, were criticised by Lenin in the article “A
Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Democracy”, in the book What Is To
Be Done? (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 255-85 and Vol. 5, pp. 347-465),
and also in his Iskra articles.


Akimovites—supporters of one of the representatives of
“Economism”, the extreme opportunist V. P. Akimov
(Makhnovets).

The Byelorussian Socialist Hromada—a title
assumed by a petty-bourgeois, nationalist organisation of the Narodnik type
which
arose in 1902.

Lenin is referring to the resolution on a labour congress
adopted at a meeting of workers from various districts of St. Petersburg in the
beginning of September 1906. The meeting was convened by the St. Petersburg
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.

Lenin: 1906/crimensh: IV







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Crisis of Menshevism



    

IV

The only “gratifying feature” in Comrade Larin’s pamphlet is his
fervent protest against blocs with the Cadets. In another article in this issue
the reader will find detailed quotations on this subject, with a description of
all the vacillations of Menshevism on this important question.


What interests us here, however, is the general description of Menshevism
given by such an “authoritative” witness as the Menshevik Larin. It
is in reference to blocs with the Cadets that he protests against
“vulgarised, bureaucratic, Menshevism”.
“Bureaucratic Menshevism”, he writes, is capable of desiring a
“suicidal alliance with the opponents of Social-Democracy in the
bourgeois camp”. We do not know whether Larin will be able to show more
determination than Martov in defending his views against Plekhanov. However,
Larin rebels against “formal” and “bureaucratic”
Menshevism on other matters besides blocs with the Cadets. For example, he says
of Menshevism, that “everything obsolescent acquires a bureaucratic
stamp”!! (p. 65). Menshevism is becoming outlived, making way for
“European realism”. “Hence the eternal melancholy,
half-heartedness and hesitancy of Menshevism” (p. 62). Concerning the
talk about a labour congress he writes: “All this talk bears the impress
of a certain reticence, timid thinking, perhaps mere hesitation to utter aloud
the thoughts that have matured within” (p. 6), etc.

 

We already know the underlying basis of this crisis of Menshevism, why it has
      degenerated into

    bureaucratism[1]

:

      it is the petty-bourgeois intellectual’s
      lack of confidence in the possibility of further revolutionary struggle,
      his fear to admit that the revolution is over, that the reaction has won a
      decisive victory. “Menshevism was only an instinctive,
      semi-spontaneous yearning for a party,” says Larin. We say:

Menshevism is the spontaneous yearning of the intellectual for a truncated
constitution and peaceful legality. Menshevism is an allegedly objective
apologia for reaction, emanating from the revolutionary camp.


From the very beginning, as early as in the Geneva newspaper
Vperyod[8]

(January-March 1905) and in the pamphlet
Two

    Tactics[2]

(July 1905), the Bolsheviks presented the question in
a totally different way. Being perfectly clear about the contradictory nature of
the interests and tasks of the various classes in the bourgeois revolution,
they stated openly at the time: It is quite possible that the Russian revolution
will end in an abortive constitution. As the supporters and ideologists of the
revolutionary proletariat, we shall do our duty to the last—we shall keep
to our revolutionary slogans despite the treachery and baseness of the liberals,
despite the vacillation, timidity and hesitancy displayed by the petty
bourgeois—we shall make the utmost use of all revolutionary
possibilities—we shall take pride in the fact that

    

we were the first to take the path of an uprising and will be the
last to abandon it, if this path in fact becomes impossible. At the
present moment we are far from admitting that all the revolutionary
possibilities and prospects have been exhausted. We openly and straightforwardly
advocate an uprising, and stubborn, persistent and long preparation for it.


And when we realise that the revolution is over, we shall say so openly and
straightforwardly. We shall then, in full view of the whole people, delete from
our platform all our direct revolutionary slogans (such as the constituent
assembly). We shall not deceive ourselves and others by Jesuitical sophistries (such
as Plekhanov’s “a Duma with full power for the

    Cadets).[3]

We shall not justify reaction and call reactionary constitutionalism a basis for
sound realism. We shall say and prove to the proletariat that the treachery of
the bourgeoisie and the vacillation of the small proprietors have killed the
bourgeois revolution, and that the proletariat itself will now prepare for and
carry out a new, socialist revolution. And therefore, the revolution having
subsided, i.e., the bourgeoisie having utterly betrayed it, we shall under no
circumstances agree to any blocs—not only with the opportunist, but even
with the revolutionary bourgeoisie—for the decline of the revolution would
convert bourgeois revolutionism into empty phrase-mongering.


That is why we are not in the least perturbed by the angry words which Larin
hurls at us in such abundance, when he shouts that Bolshevism is approaching a
crisis, that it is played out, that we have always trailed behind the
Mensheviks, etc. All these pinpricks only evoke a condescending smile.


Individuals have left and will leave the Bolsheviks, but there cannot be any
crisis in our trend. The fact is that right from the very beginning we
declared (see One Step Forward, Two Steps

      Back[4]

):

we are not creating
a special “Bolshevik” trend, always and everywhere we merely uphold
the point of view of revolutionary Social-Democracy. And right up to
the social revolution there will inevitably always be an

    

opportunist wing and a revolutionary wing of Social-Democracy.


A cursory glance at the history of “Bolshevism” is sufficient to
convince anyone of that.


1903-04. The Mensheviks advocate democracy in organisation. The Bolsheviks call
this intellectualist phrase mongering, as long as the Party does not come out
openly. In the Geneva pamphlet (1905), the Menshevik who signed himself
“A Worker”[9]

admits that in fact there was no
democracy among the Mensheviks. The Menshevik Larin admits that their
“talk about the elective principle” was “sheer
invention”, an attempt to “deceive history”, and that, in
fact, in the Menshevik “St. Petersburg group there was no elective
principle even as late as the autumn of 1905” (p. 62). And immediately after the
October Revolution the Bolsheviks were the first to announce, in
Novaya Zhizn,[10]

the actual introduction of
democracy in the

Party.[5]


End of 1904. The Zemstvo campaign. The Mensheviks trail behind the liberals. The
Bolsheviks (in spite of the frequently circulated fable to the contrary) do not
reject good demonstrations” before the Zemstvo councillors, but they
reject the “poor arguments of the

   intellectuals,[6]

who said that there
were two contending forces in the arena (the tsar and the liberals),
and that demonstrations before the Zemstvo councillors were a higher type of
demonstration. Now the Menshevik Larin admits that the Zemstvo campaign was
“sheer invention” (p. 62), that it was a “shrewd and cunning
trick” (p. 57).


Beginning of 1905. The Bolsheviks openly and straight forwardly raise the
question of an uprising and of preparing for it. In a resolution adopted at the
Third Congress they predict the combination of the strike with an
uprising. The Mensheviks are evasive and try to wriggle out of the tasks of
an uprising; they talk about arming the masses with the fervid desire to arm
themselves.

 

August-September 1905. The Mensheviks (Parvus in the new Iskra) call
for participation in the Bulygin Duma. The Bolsheviks call for an active boycott
of this Duma, for direct advocacy of an uprising.


October-December 1905. The popular struggle in the form of strikes and
insurrection sweeps away the Bulygin Duma. The Menshevik Larin admits in a
written declaration at the Unity Congress that when the tide of the revolution
was at its height the Mensheviks acted like Bolsheviks. In the rudimentary
bodies of the provisional government we, the Social-Democrats, sat side by side
with the revolutionary bourgeoisie.


Beginning of 1906. The Mensheviks are despondent. They have no faith in the Duma
and no faith in the revolution. They appeal for participation in the Duma
elections in order to boycott the Duma (Larin, p. 57). The Bolsheviks
do their duty as revolutionaries, do their utmost to achieve the boycott of the
Second Duma, in which nobody in revolutionary circles had any
confidence.


May-June 1906. The Duma campaign. The boycott has failed owing to the treachery
of the bourgeoisie. The Bolsheviks conduct their revolutionary work on new,
though worse ground. During the Duma period the whole people see still more
clearly the difference between our tactics, the tactics of the revolutionary
Social-Democrats, and opportunism:

criticism of the Cadets in the Duma, the struggle to free the Trudoviks from
Cadet influence, criticism of parliamentary illusions, advocacy of a
revolutionary rapprochement among the Left groups in the Duma.


July 1906. The dissolution of the Duma. The Mensheviks lose their heads, declare
for an immediate demonstration strike and partial actions. The Bolsheviks
protest. Larin, referring to this, says nothing about the protest of the
three members of the Central Committee which was published for Party members
only. What Larin says about this incident is not true. The Bolsheviks point
out the futility of a demonstration, and advocate an uprising at a later

      date.[7]

The Mensheviks, in conjunction with the revolutionary bourgeoisie,
sign appeals for an uprising.

 

End of 1906. The Bolsheviks realise that the treachery of the bourgeoisie makes
      it necessary to take a circuitous path and go into the Duma. Down with all
      blocs! Above all, down with blocs with the Cadets! The Mensheviks are in
      favour of blocs.


No, Comrade Larin, we have no need to be ashamed of
this course of the struggle between the revolutionary and
the opportunist wing of Russian Social-Democracy!

 

Notes
 

[1]

Another instance of the irony of history!  Ever since 1903 the
Mensheviks have been shouting about the “formalism” and “bureaucratism”
of the Bolsheviks. Since then they have always been in possession of the
“bureaucratic” and “formal” prerogatives of the Party as a whole. And
now a Menshevik confirms that Menshevism has degenerated into
bureaucratism. The Bolsheviks could not have wished for a better
rehabilitation of themselves. Larin is not looking for the bureaucratism of
Menshevism where in fact it is rooted. The source of this bureaucratism is
that opportunism which under the guise of “Europeanism” is being
instilled into the Mensheviks by Axelrod and Plekhanov. There is no trace
of “Europeanism” in the reflected ideology and habits of the Swiss petty
bourgeois. Petty-bourgeois Switzerland is the servants’ ball of the real
Europe, the Europe of revolutionary traditions and in tense class struggle
of the broad masses. Bureaucratism was fully revealed in Plekhanov’s
presentation of the question of a labour congress (a labour congress versus
a Party congress), against which Larin is so fervently and sincerely
protesting.—Lenin

V. I. Lenin. Other members of the editorial board were V. V. Vorovsky,
M. S. Olminsky, and A. V. Lunacharsky.


The outstanding part played by Vperyod in combating Menshevism,

(“Worker”) in Geneva in 1904 with a preface by P. B. Axelrod. The author of
the pamphlet opposed Lenin’s organisational plan for building the Party but was
compelled to admit that the “democratism” of the Mensheviks
amounted actually to a struggle for leading positions in the Party. A detailed
characterisation of the pamphlet was given by Lenin in his article “Fine
Words Butter No Parsnips”. “The pamphlet shows admirably how the
knights of the ’fine phrase’ are exposed by their own followers,” wrote

Novaya Zhizn (New Life)—the first legal
Bolshevik newspaper, published in St. Petersburg as a daily from October 27
(November 9) to December 3 (16), 1905. On his return to St. Petersburg from
emigration in early November Lenin took over the editorship. Novaya Zhizn
was actually the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. Closely associated with the
paper were V. V. Vorovsky, M. S. Olminsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and others. Maxim
Gorky contributed many articles and gave the paper considerable financial
assistance.


Lenin’s first article “The Reorganisation of the Party” appeared in
Novaya Zhizn, No. 9, November 10 (23), 1905. Then, over a dozen other
articles of V. I. Lenin’s were printed. The newspaper attained a daily
circulation of about 80,000. It suffered continual persecution; 15 issues out of
27 were confiscated and destroyed. After No. 27 of December 2 (15), Novaya
Zhizn was closed down by the government. The last issue, No. 28, appeared
illegally.

Such is the heading Karl Kautsky gave to the last chapter of his article
“The Driving Forces and Prospects of the Russian Revolution”,
published in the latest numbers of Neue Zeit.[1]

As in the
case of other works of Kautsky’s, a Russian translation of this article will
undoubtedly soon be published. This is an article that all Social-Democrats
should certainly read, not because a German theoretician of Marxism can
be expected to supply answers to the current problems of our tactics
(the Russian Social-Democrats would not be worth much if they waited for such
answers from afar), but because Kautsky gives us a remarkably logical analysis
of the underlying principles of the whole tactics of the
Social-Democrats in the Russian bourgeois revolution. To all members of our
Party, to all class-conscious workers, overburdened with the humdrum tasks of
everyday work, stunned with the hackneyed banalities of unscrupulous
bourgeois-liberal scribblers, such works by thoughtful, well-informed and
experienced Social-Democrats are especially valuable, for they help us to rise
above everyday matters, to get an insight into the fundamental questions of the
tactics of the proletariat, and to obtain a clearer idea of the theoretical
tendencies and the actual mode of thought of the various trends in the
Social-Democratic movement.


Kautsky’s latest article is particularly important in this respect, for it
enables us to coin pare the character of the questions put by
Plekhanov to Kautsky (among other foreign socialists) with Kautsky’s
method of answering some of these questions.

 

    Plekhanov, whom the Cadet Melgunov, in today’s Tovarishch (December
    10), aptly called the “former leader and theoretician of
    Russian Social-Democracy”, asked Kautsky:

(1) What is the “general character” of the Russian revolution:
    bourgeois or socialist.

(2) What should be the attitude of the Social-Democrats towards the bourgeois
    democrats? and

(3) What tactics should the Social-Democrats adopt in the Duma elections.


The leader of the Russian opportunists was angling for Kautsky’s approval of
blocs with the Cadets. The leader of the German revolutionary Social-Democrats
guessed that the questioner was trying to suggest his reply on a point not
directly mentioned in the questions, and preferred to answer Plekhanov with a
dispassionate, circumstantial, propagandist explanation of how a
Marxist should formulate questions concerning bourgeois revolution and
bourgeois democracy in general. Let us examine Kautsky’s explanation close]y.


It would be superficial to regard the Russian revolution merely as a movement
for the overthrow of absolutism. It must be regarded as the awakening of the
mass of the people to independent political activity. Such is Kautsky’s main
premise.


This means the following. It would be a superficial analysis of the tasks of
the Social-Democratic movement that merely pointed to the attainment of
political liberty (the overthrow of absolutism) and to the “common”
character of this task for various classes. It is necessary to examine the
position of the masses, their objective conditions of life, the
different classes among them, the real nature of the liberty for which
they are in fact striving. We must not deduce from a common phraseology
that there are common interests, nor must we conclude from “political
liberty” in general that there must be a joint struggle of
different classes. On the contrary, by a precise analysis of the position and
interests of the various classes, we must ascertain how far, and in what
respects, their fight for freedom, their aspirations for freedom, are identical,
or coincide (or whether they coincide at all). We must reason, not like the
Cadets, not like the liberals, not like Prokopovich & Co., but like
Marxists.


Next. If our point of departure is the interests of the masses, then the crux
of the Russian revolution is the agrarian
    

question. We must judge of the defeat or victory of the revolution not
from government violence and the manifestations of “reaction”
(which engages all the attention of many of our Cadet-like Social-Democrats),
but from the position of the masses in their struggle for land.


Agriculture is the basis of the national economy of Russia. Agriculture is
declining, the peasants are ruined. Even liberals (Kautsky quotes the Cadets
Petrunkevich and Manuilov) realise this. Kautsky, however, is not content with
pointing to the unanimity of the liberals and the socialists on this
point. He does not let this lead him to the Cadet conclusion: “Therefore,
the Social-Democrats should sup port the Cadets.” He at once proceeds to analyse
the class interests concerned, and shows that the liberals will
inevitably be half-hearted in regard to the agrarian question. While
admitting the decline of agriculture in general, they fail to understand the
capitalist character of agriculture and the resulting problem of the special
causes which retard this capitalist, and not some other, evolution.


And Kautsky minutely analyses one of these special causes, namely, the shortage
of capital in Russia. Foreign capital plays a particularly important part in our
country. This retards the capitalist development of agriculture. Kautsky’s
conclusion is: “The decline of agriculture, alongside the growing strength
of the industrial proletariat, is the main cause of the present Russian
revolution.”


You see: Kautsky makes a careful and conscientious study of the specific
character of the bourgeois revolution in Russia and does not evade it as the
Cadets and the Cadet-like Social-Democrats do by doctrinaire references to the
“general character” of every bourgeois revolution.


Next, Kautsky analyses the solution of the agrarian question. Here, too, he is
not content with the stock liberal phrase: You see, even the Cadet Duma is in
favour of land for the peasants (see the writings of Plekhanov). No. He shows
that the mere increase in size of holdings is no good to the peasants unless
they obtain enormous financial assistance. The autocracy is incapable of really
helping the peasantry. And the liberals? They demand redemption payments. But
such compensation can only ruin the peasants. “Confiscation of
the large estates” (Kautsky’s italics) is the only way by which

    

the peasant’s landholding can be substantially increased without imposing new
      burdens upon him. But the liberals are most emphatically opposed to
      confiscation.


This argument of Kautsky’s is worth considering in detail. Anyone at all
familiar with the party shadings in the revolutionary circles of Russia knows
that on this question of redemption payments the opportunists of both
revolutionary parties have not only been contaminated with the liberal view,
but have also distorted what Kautsky says in this connection. Our Mensheviks, at
the Unity Congress and at a number of meetings in St. Petersburg (e.g., Dan in
his reports on the Congress to the St. Petersburg workers in the summer),
criticised as wrong that clause of the agrarian programme which was adopted with
the support of the Bolsheviks, who categorically insisted on the substitution
of “confiscation” for “alienation” (see Maslov’s
original draft). Our Mensheviks said this was wrong, that only vulgar
revolutionaries could insist on confiscation, that for the social revolution it was
unimportant whether there was compensation or not, and in this connection they
referred to Kautsky’s pamphlet The Social Revolution, in which, with
reference to the socialist revolution in general, Kautsky explains that
compensation is permissible. And the Socialist-Revolutionary Mensheviks, and
the semi-Cadet Popular Socialists, have used exactly the same arguments to
defend their turn towards liberalism on the question of compensation (in one of
the issues of Narodno-Sotsialisticheskoye Obozreniye[2]),

and they, too, cited Kautsky.


Kautsky is probably unaware of the behaviour of the Mensheviks on this
question, or of the significance of the policy pursued by the Popular Socialists
and their group. But in his formulation of the question of compensation
in the Russian revolution he has again given all our opportunists an excellent
lesson on how one should not argue. It is wrong to draw a conclusion about
compensation in Russia in 1905-06 from general premises about
the relation between compensation and confiscation in various revolutions, or in
the socialist revolution in general. One must proceed the other way round. One
must ascertain which classes in Russia gave rise to the special features of our
formulation of the question of compensation and deduce the political significance

    

of this question in this revolution from the interests of these classes,
and only then decide whether the views held by the different parties are right
or wrong.


It is quite obvious that, as a result of taking this course, Kautsky did not
blur the difference between the liberals and the revolutionaries on the
question of compensation (as the Plekhanovites and Popular Socialists always
do), but revealed the depth of this difference. Plekhanov, in putting
his questions to Kautsky, concealed the difference between the
“opposition” and “revolutionary” movements by avoiding
concrete questions. Kautsky swept Plekhanov’s concealment aside, brought the
important question of compensation into the light of day, and showed Plekhanov
that not only the Black Hundreds, but the liberals as well, are
“in their own way” fighting against the revolutionary movement of
the peasants.


Kautsky writes: “Without the abolition of the standing army, and of naval
armament construction, without the confiscation of the entire property of the
royal family and of the monasteries, without state bankruptcy, without the
confiscation of the big monopolies, insofar as they are still in private hands, the
railways, oilfields, mines, iron and steel works, etc., it will be impossible to
obtain the enormous sums necessary to extricate Russian agriculture from its
terrible plight.”


Recall the customary Menshevik talk about the utopian and visionary ideas of the
Bolsheviks; for instance, Plekhanov’s speeches at the Congress on the subject
of the demand that cardinal agrarian demands should be linked with cardinal
political issues (abolition of the standing army, election of officials by the
people, etc.). Plekhanov scoffed at the idea of abolishing the standing army and
of the people electing government officials! Plekhanov’s
“Sovremennaya Zhizn”[3]
approves the line of Nashe
Dyelo, calling political opportunism “political materialism”
(??), counterposing it to “revolutionary romanticism”.


It turns out that the circumspect Kautsky goes much further than the
most extreme Bolshevik and makes far more “utopian” and
“romantic” (from the opportunist standpoint) demands in
connection with the agrarian question!

 

Kautsky demands not only the confiscation of the landlords’ estates, not only
      the abolition of the standing army, but also the confiscation of big
      capitalist monopolies!


And Kautsky quite logically observes immediately after the above-quoted passage:
it is clear, however, that the liberals are frightened by such gigantic tasks,
such radical changes in existing property relations. Basically, they want no
more than to continue the present policy without encroaching on the basis for
the exploitation of Russia by foreign capital. They are firmly in favour of a
standing army, which alone, in their opinion, can maintain order and save
their property..."


Plekhanov protests that he has not been treated fairly. He only asked Kautsky’s
opinion on the question of supporting the opposition parties in the Duma
elections, and he was given a reply on a different subject! Duma elections
and—the abolition of the standing army! What a freak of anarchist fancy,
what revolutionary romanticism instead of the “political
materialism” demanded by the opportunist!


But Kautsky continues his “tactless” criticism of the liberals in
answer to the question about the Duma elections. He accuses them of wanting to
go on extorting billions of rubles from the Russian people for armaments and
interest on loans.

“They [the liberals] imagine that the establishment of a
Duma will suffice to conjure billions of rubles out of the around.”
“Liberalism is just as incapable [of satisfying the Russian peasants] as
tsarism.” Kautsky devotes a special chapter to explaining the attitude of
liberalism to Social-Democracy. He points out that in Russia there are no
bourgeois democrats of the old type, among whom the urban petty bourgeoisie
occupied a primary place. In Russia, unlike the West, the urban petty
bourgeoisie “will never be a reliable support of the revolutionary
parties”.


“In Russia the firm backbone of a bourgeois democracy is absent”. Kautsky
draws this conclusion both from an analysis of the special position of the urban
petty bourgeoisie and from the consideration that the class antagonism between
the capitalists and the proletariat is now far more developed in Russia than it
was in the period of bourgeois revolutions of the “old type”. This
conclusion is of enormous importance. It forms the very kernel of Kautsky’s
“amendment”

    

to Plekhanov’s formulation of the question, an amendment which is
virtually a radically different formulation.


In his questions Plekhanov employs the old types of bourgeois
democracy, and nothing more. He uses a hackneyed term, quite forgetting to
determine on the basis of Russian data the degree of
democracy, and its stability, etc. possessed by the different
strata that are now coming forward in Russia as bourgeois democrats. It is
Kautsky’s merit that he point ed to this basic omission of Plekhanov’s and
proceeded to explain to him in a practical manner the method which must
be applied in order to reach a real understanding of bourgeois democracy in
Russia. And through Kautsky’s skilful analysis the outlines of the
vital social forces of Russia begin to emerge from the old, hackneyed
formula. the urban petty bourgeoisie; the landlord class, with its penny-worth
of liberalism and pounds-worth of support of the counter-revolutionary Black
Hundreds, the capitalists, with their mortal dread of the proletariat; and,
finally, the peasantry.


The nebulous question of the attitude to be adopted to wards “bourgeois
democracy” (of the type found in France in the forties of the last
century?) has disappeared. The fog has been dispelled. It was this fog that our
Prokopoviches, Kuskovas, Izgoyevs, Struves and other liberals used to cloud the
vision of the people, and Plekhanov is now playing into their hands. In place of
the fog of old stereotyped formulas, a genuine Marxist analysis has shown us the
quite special relationships of the democracy of the various strata and
elements of the Russian bourgeoisie.


By means of this analysis Kautsky determines that peculiar relation between
Russian liberalism and the revolutionary character of the peasants, which the
Cadets deliberately conceal, and to which many Social-Democrats are blind! ’The
more the peasants become revolutionary, the more do the big landowners become
reactionary, the more does liberalism cease to find in them the support it
previously had, the more unstable become the liberal parties, and the
more the liberal professors and lawyers in the towns shift-to the
right, so as not to lose all connection with their previous mainstay." This
process “is only accelerating the bankruptcy of liberalism”.

 

Only after laying bare the roots of this bankruptcy of liberalism in
    the present Russian revolution does Kautsky proceed to give a direct answer
    to Plekhanov’s questions. Before answering the question whether we should
    support the “opposition”, we must understand (Kautsky explains)
    the class foundations and the class nature of this “opposition”
    (or Russian liberalism), and in what relation the development of the
    revolution and of the revolutionary classes stands to the position and
    interests of liberalism. In elucidating this at the outset, Kautsky
    proceeds, firstly, to reveal the bankruptcy of liberalism, and only
    then to explain to the reader the question that interests
    Plekhanov: Should we support the opposition in the Duma elections? It is not
    surprising that Kautsky had no need to answer two-thirds of Plekhanov’s
    questions....


Although Kautsky’s answers do not satisfy Plekhanov, they will help the
rank-and-file Russian Social-Democrats to think properly.


(1) Is the revolution in Russia a bourgeois or a socialist revolution?


That is not the way to put the question, says Kautsky. That is the old
stereotyped way of putting it. Of course, the Russian revolution is not a
socialist revolution. The socialist dictatorship of the proletariat (its
“undivided sway”) is out of the question. But neither is it a bourgeois
revolution, for “the bourgeoisie is not one of the driving forces of
the present revolutionary movement in Russia”. “Wherever the
proletariat comes out independently, the bourgeoisie ceases to be a
revolutionary class.”


And Kautsky declares with a vehemence even greater than the
“tactlessness” the Bolsheviks usually display towards the liberals,
that our bourgeoisie fears revolution more than reaction; that it hates
absolutism because it engenders revolution; that it wants political freedom
in order to stop the revolution! (And Plekhanov, in his questions,
naively identified the struggle of the opposition against the old order with the
struggle against the government’s attempts to crush the revolutionary movement!)


This first answer of Kautsky’s is a brilliant vindication of the fundamental
principles of Bolshevik tactics. Beginning with the Geneva newspapers
Vperyod and Proletary, and continuing

    

with the pamphlet Two Tactics, the Russian Bolsheviks have
always regarded as the main issue in their struggle against the
Mensheviks the Right-wing Social-Democrats’ distortion of the concept:
“bourgeois revolution”. We have said hundreds of times, and have
backed our statements with innumerable declarations by the Mensheviks, that to
interpret the category “bourgeois revolution” in the sense of
recognising the leadership and guiding role of the bourgeoisie in the Russian
revolution is to vulgarise Marxism. A bourgeois revolution in spite of
the instability of the bourgeoisie, by paralysing the instability of
the bourgeoisie—that is how the Bolsheviks formulated the fundamental task
of the Social-Democrats in the revolution.


Kautsky’s analysis satisfies us completely. He has fully confirmed our
contention that we are defending the position of revolutionary Social-Democracy
against opportunism, and not creating any “peculiar” Bolshevik
trend, and this confirmation is the more valuable for having been given by
expounding the essence of the matter, and not by a mere staff officer’s
“endorsement” of this or that group.


(2) Kautsky not only considers it “quite possible” that
    “in the course of the revolution victory will fall to the lot of
    the Social-Democratic Party”, but declares also that it is the
    duty of the Social-Democrats “to inspire their supporters with
    this confidence in victory, for it is impossible to fight successfully
    if one renounces victory before hand”.


This conclusion of Kautsky’s is a second brilliant vindication of Bolshevik
tactics. Anyone who is at all familiar with the publications of the two trends
in the Social-Democratic movement must know that the Mensheviks have most
strenuously disputed the possibility and expediency of a Social-Democratic
victory in the present Russian revolution. As far back as the spring of 1905,
the Mensheviks at their conference (which Plekhanov, Axelrod and others
attended) adopted a resolution saying that the Social-Democratic Party must
not strive to win power. And since then this idea that the
Social-Democrats cannot strive for the victory of Social-Democracy in
the bourgeois revolution has run like a red (or black?) thread through
the whole literature and the whole policy of Menshevism.

 

This policy is opportunism. The victory of Social-Democracy in the
    present Russian revolution is quite possible. It is our duty to
    inspire all adherents of the workers’ party with confidence in
    this victory; it is impossible to fight success fully if one
    renounces victory beforehand.


These simple and obvious truths, which have been obscured by Plekhanov’s
sophistry and scholasticism, must be pondered over and mastered by the whole of
our Party.


(3) To imagine that “all the classes and parties which are striving for
    political freedom have simply to work together in order to achieve
    it”, means “seeing only the political surface of
    events”.


This is the third vindication of Bolshevism. A mere reference to the fact that
the Cadets “are fighting for freedom in their own way” is not enough
to justify joint action with them. This is the ABC of Marxism, which Plekhanov,
Axelrod and their admirers have temporarily obscured.


(4) Which class can help the Social-Democratic proletariat to achieve victory
    in the present revolution, can support the proletariat and determine the
    limits of the immediately realisable changes? In Kautsky’s opinion, this
    class is the peasantry. Only this class has “stable,
    common economic interests with the proletariat throughout the
    whole period of the revolution”. “The common interests
    of the industrial proletariat and the peasants are the basis of the
    revolutionary strength of Russian Social-Democracy and of the possibility
    of its victory; but at the same time these common interests determine the
    limits within which this victory can be utilised”.


This means: not the socialist dictatorship of the proletariat, but the
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. In other words,
Kautsky has formulated the old premise underlying the whole tactics of the
revolutionary Social-Democrats, as distinguished from both the opportunists and
the “enthusiasts”. Marx said that every genuine and complete victory
of a revolution can only be a dictatorship,[4]

having in mind, of course, the dictatorship (i.e., unrestricted power) of the
masses over the few, and not vice versa. But the important thing for us, of
course, is not any particular formulation of their tactics by the Bolsheviks,

    

but the essence of these tactics, which Kautsky has
entirely endorsed.


Anyone who wants to think like a Marxist and not like a Cadet about the role of
the proletariat in our revolution, and about its possible and necessary
“ally”, must come round to the views of revolutionary and not
opportunist Social Democracy on the principles of proletarian tactics.

As our journal is illegal, we are unable to follow at all regularly
the Social-Democratic newspapers that are published in Russia in
languages other than Russian. And yet, unless close and constant contact is
maintained between the Social-Democrats of all nationalities in Russia, our
Party cannot become a real All-Russian Party.


Therefore, we earnestly request all comrades who know Lettish, Finnish, Polish,
Yiddish, Armenian, Georgian or other languages, and who receive
Social-Democratic newspapers in these languages, to help us to keep Russian
readers informed about the state of the Social-Democratic movement and the
views of the non-Russian Social-Democrats on tactics. This assistance could take
the form, not only of reviews of Social-Democratic literature on a particular
question (like the articles in Proletary on the controversy between
the Polish Social-Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party, and on the Lettish
view of guerrilla warfare), but also of translations of articles, or even of
outstanding passages from an article.


Recently, a comrade sent us a translation of an article entitled “A
Platform for the Election Campaign”, signed “M” and published
in Volkszeitung, the organ of the Bund, No. 208 (November 16). We have
no means of judging to what extent that article expresses the unanimous view of
the editors, but in any case it reflects certain trends among Jewish
Social-Democrats. Russian Social-Democrats, too, who are familiar only with the
Bolshevik and Menshevik method of treating a question, need to be aware of these
trends. Here is the translation of this article:



“The energy and influence that our Party will be able to exert in the
elections will depend above all on the clarity and definiteness of our position
and slogans. We are faced with important political and

    

social questions, and it is our task to formulate them so clearly and definitely
that only one answer will be possible, namely; ours. If our position is not
definite enough, even the most perfect organisation will be of no avail. The
importance of our platform in the election campaign depends entirely on the
clarity of our position.


“The Seventh Congress of the Bund laid down the main lines of our tactics
as follows: the dissolution of the Duma has clearly proved to wide sections of
the population that it is impossible to obtain land and liberty by peaceful
means, and that the only solution is an armed uprising. This does not mean that
the elections to the new Duma imply a change from revolutionary tactics to
peaceful and constitutional tactics, since in the elections it is
realised that revolutionary tactics are necessary; the
electors will demand that their deputies convert the Duma into a revolutionary
instrument of the mass of the people. Our task in the elections is to make this
principle clear to the voters, and this principle requires that the elections
themselves be made an arena for mobilising the revolutionary masses of the
people.


“While the Duma was in session, and still more so since the dissolution of the
Duma, the country made great strides in developing its political consciousness,
thanks to which the revolutionary parties count on success at the elections. At
the first elections the petty-bourgeois voters voted for the Cadets, thus
expressing their ardent protest against the atrocities of the government. Not
having yet discarded their constitutional illusions, these voters felt sure that
the Cadets would secure land and liberty for them. The Duma tactics have
shattered these illusions and have convinced them that land and liberty can be
gained only by fighting, not by peaceful means. The voters are now faced with
the question of bow to fight, and who is capable of fighting: the Cadets with
their diplomatic parliamentarism, and, at best, with their weapon of ’passive
resistance’, or the revolutionary parties with their militant tactics?
Obviously, when the voters are faced with the question of how to attain real
freedom, they realise that only the revolutionary and not the constitutional
parties are capable of fighting.


“The Cadets have realised this and are trying their utmost to ignore all
the lessons that events have taught them; they are trying to drag the political
consciousness of the country back to what it was on the eve of the first
elections. ’Not a step forward,’ is their cry. ’Forget all the lessons of
history. The object of the new elections,’ they say, ’is to recreate the
political conditions under which the First Duma functioned. The people must
return to the Duma the former Duma majority, and thus give rise to a political
situation in the country in which the only way out will be a responsible Cabinet
from the Duma majority’ (Rech, No. 189). If Russia needs a real
constitution and a genuine popular representative assembly,’ says Rech,
No. 196, ’then the people will return to the Duma representatives who will
repeat what the First Duma stated in its reply to the address from the throne
and who will set to work to do what the First Duma was prevented from doing.’
The question cannot fail to arise as to what will happen if the Second Duma also
is ’prevented’ from doing what the First Duma intended to
do. To this the Constitutional-Democrats reply that ’the government

    

will have to yield to the firm, peacefully and lawfully expressed will of the
    electorate’ (Rech, No. 195) The Cadets know very well that their
    strength rests on constitutional illusions, and that is why they are doing
    their utmost to instil into the minds of the voters the idea that
    prevailed on the eve of the first elections, and to imbue them with faith in
    the omnipotent power of the ’firm, peacefully and lawfully expressed will of
    the electorate’. The strength of the revolutionary parties does not lie in the
    voters’ belief in the ’omnipotent power of the firm, peacefully and lawfully
    expressed will of the electorate’, but, on the contrary, in their disbelief
    in that power, in their clear realisation of the necessity of a
    revolutionary struggle.


“Our task, therefore, as far as the voters are concerned, is categorically
to ask them whether they want the majority in the future Duma to he the same as
the previous one, with its flexible tactics that are incapable of
achieving anything. Do they want the future Duma merely to ’repeat’ what the
first one said, or should it go beyond idle talk and adopt more efficacious
methods of struggle? Should the new Duma ’recreate the political situation’ of
June and July, which led to nothing, or should it take a step towards real
victory for the people?


“This question must serve as our platform in the election campaign. We must
surround the Cadet Party with an atmosphere of the most profound disbelief in
their ability to secure land and liberty. We must energetically and ruthlessly
criticise passive resistance—the method of struggle they invented in
Helsingfors—and reveal to the people the impotence and inconsistency of
their methods of struggle.


“Only if this necessary condition is observed will the Second Duma be a
step in advance of the First Duma.”



Reading this article carefully we see that it fairly accurately reflects the
views of the Bund delegation at the last All-Russian Conference of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. As we know, on the one hand, this delegation
voted with the Mensheviks to sanction blocs with the Cadets, but on the other
hand, it voted with the Bolsheviks for drastic amendments to the Central
Committee’s “draft election platform” (the addition of the slogan
of a republic, of a reference to an uprising, and of an exact characterisation
of the parties, and an amendment giving a more precise explanation of the class
nature of the Social-Democratic Party, etc.: see the resolution of the
Conference on “amendments” to the platform in Proletary,
No. 8[1]).



The article by Comrade M. given above seems to be such a Bolshevik
article because we see here only the left hand of the Bund; the right hand is
hidden in articles advocating blocs with the Cadets.


At all events, the Bundists’ idea of blocs with the Cadets

    

is not that of the Mensheviks. Their case is an exceptionally good illustration
of the famous saying:

Si duo faciunt idem, non est idem (“if two
do the same thing, it is no longer the same thing”).

There is a certain
difference between the two, and this difference cannot fail to affect their ways
of doing the same thing, their methods, the results of their “doing the
same thing”, etc. The Mensheviks’ idea of blocs with the Cadets and the
Bundists’ idea of them are not the same. For the Mensheviks, blocs with the
Cadets are fully in accord with their general tactics; in the case of the
Bundists, they are not. As a result, we get articles like the one we have
quoted, which clearly reveal the inconsistency, the lack of steadfastness, of
the Bundists, who took part in the boycott yesterday and today justify the
boycott of the Witte Duma, while at the same time sanctioning blocs with the
Cadets. In the case of the Mensheviks, blocs with the Cadets naturally and
spontaneously assume the character of ideological blocs. In the case of the
Bundists, these blocs are intended to be only “technical” blocs.


But politics have their own objective logic, irrespective of what persons or
parties plan in advance. The Bundist proposes that the bloc should be only a
technical one, but the political forces of the whole country dispose that the
bloc turns out to be an ideological one. After the jubilation with which the
Cadets received the Menshevik decision of the Conference, after Plekhanov’s
famous Herostratian letter in Tovarishch about “a Duma with full
power”, there is scarcely need to prove the point.


Consider carefully the assertion of the author of the article that “the
Cadets know very well that their strength rests on constitutional illusions, and
that is why they are doing their utmost to instil [these illusions] into the
minds of the voters”.


“The strength of the Cadets rests on constitutional
illusions”.... Is this true; and what does it really mean? If it is not true,
if the strength of the Cadets rests on the fact that they are the foremost
representatives of bourgeois democracy in the Russian bourgeois revolution, then
the general tactical line of Menshevism, or of the Right wing of
Social-Democracy, is correct. If it is true, if the strength of the Cadets rests
not on the strength of bourgeois democracy, but

    

on the strength of the illusions of the people, then the general
    tactical line of Bolshevism, or of the Left wing of Social-Democracy, is
    correct.


In a bourgeois revolution the Social-Democrats cannot but support bourgeois
democracy: such is the main premise of Plekhanov and his like; and from this
premise they draw the direct and immediate conclusion of the need to
support the Cadets. But we say: The premise is right, but the conclusion is
worthless, for we have still to ascertain which parties or trends at the present
moment represent the force of bourgeois democracy that is really
capable of fighting. The Cadets, the Trudoviks, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries are all “bourgeois democrats” from the
Marxist standpoint, i.e., the only scientific analysis. The “force”
of the Cadets is not the fighting force of the bourgeois masses (the peasantry,
the urban petty bourgeoisie), it is not the economic and money force of the
landlord class (the Black Hundreds) or the capitalist class (the Octobrists): it
is the “force” of the bourgeois intelligentsia, which is not an
independent economic class and therefore is not an
independent political force; consequently, it is a usurped
“force”, depending on the influence of the bourgeois intelligentsia
over other classes which have not yet worked out a clear, independent political
ideology of their own, which submit to the ideological leadership of the
bourgeois intelligentsia; it is primarily the “force” of those
erroneous opinions concerning the nature of democracy and the methods
of fighting for it which the bourgeois intelligentsia is propagating and
cultivating among the bourgeois masses.


To deny this means childishly allowing oneself to be beguiled by the resounding
words: “the party of people’s freedom”; it means closing one’s eyes
to the generally known fact that the Cadets have neither the masses nor a
decisive number of landlord and capitalist elements behind them.


To admit it means admitting that the task of the day for the workers’
party is to combat the influence of the Cadets over the people—not because
we have been dreaming of a bourgeois revolution without bourgeois democracy (an
absurdity imputed to us by the Social-Democrats of the Right) but because the
Cadets are preventing the real force of bourgeois democracy from
developing and asserting itself.

 

Only a minority of the landlords of Russia (the great majority are Black
Hundreds) and a minority of the capitalists (the great majority are Octobrists)
belong to the Cadet Party. It has the majority, the mass, of the bourgeois
intelligentsia only. Hence the spectacular politics of the Cadets, so enticing to
political infants and politically impotent dotards, their din and clamour,
their jubilation over cheap victories, their predominance in the liberal press,
in bourgeois science, etc. Hence, too, the sham nature of this party,
which corrupts the people with its treacherous propaganda for a compromise with
the monarchy, yet in fact lacks the power to achieve any such compromise.


The Cadets are not bourgeois democracy, but the incarnation of the betrayal of
democracy by the bourgeoisie—just as the French radical socialists, for
instance, or the German social-liberals, are not intellectual socialists, but
the incarnation of the betrayal of socialism by the intellectuals. Therefore,
supporting bourgeois democracy means exposing the sham of the Cadets’
quasi-democracy.


Therefore, the Plekhanovites are causing immense harm to the revolution and to
the cause of the working class with their perpetual cry: we must fight reaction,
not the Cadets!


Dear comrades! Your failure to grasp the point lies in your failure to
understand the significance of our struggle against the Cadets. What is
the kernel and essence of this struggle? Is it that the Cadets are
“bourgeois”? Of course not. It is that the Cadets are mere chatterers
about democracy, traitors to militant democracy.


To proceed: Have the Cadets any influence on the mass of the people, on the
bourgeois-democratic mass of the people? Of course, they have, and very
extensive influence too, with numerous newspapers, and so forth. Now judge for
yourselves: Can we call upon the bourgeois-democratic mass of the people to
fight reaction if we do not unmask their present ideological leaders,
who are damaging the cause of bourgeois democracy? Impossible, dear
comrades.


Fighting reaction means, first of all, liberating the masses from reaction
ideologically. But the strong and tenacious ideological influence of
“reaction” on the masses is not Black Hundred, but Cadet
influence. This is not a paradox. The Black Hundreds are undisguised, crude
enemies, who can

    

burn, kill and cause havoc, but cannot convince even the ignorant muzhik, whereas
      the Cadets convince both the muzhiks and the urban petty
    bourgeoisie. And what do they convince them of? That the monarch is not
    responsible, that it is possible to win freedom by peaceful means (i.e., by
    leaving power in the hands of the monarchy), that a land-purchase scheme
    concocted by the landlords is the method of transferring land to the
    peasants most advantageous for them, etc., etc.


That is why you cannot convince either the simple-minded peasant or the
simple-minded petty bourgeois that it is necessary to wage a serious struggle
unless you undermine the influence on them of Cadet phrases and Cadet ideology. And
anyone who says: “we must fight reaction, not the Cadets”
fails to understand the ideological tasks of the struggle, sees the
essence of struggle, not in convincing the masses, but in physical action,
understanding the word struggle in the vulgar sense: “strike” at the
reactionaries, but don’t “strike” at the Cadets,


Of course, for the time being we shall strike by force of arms, not at the
Cadets, or even at the Octobrists, but only at the government and its
direct servants—and after we have beaten them, the Cadet will, for a fee,
stick up for republican democracy just as today (for a professorial salary, or
a lawyer’s fee) he is sticking up for monarchist democracy. But, in order to
gain a real victory over reaction we must free the masses from the ideological
influence of the Cadets, who are giving them false notions of the aims and
nature of the fight against reaction.


Let us return to the Bundists. Can they really fail to see now that the
“technical” blocs with the Cadets which they sanction have in fact
already become a mighty instrument for strengthening belief in the
Cadets (and not for creating an atmosphere of disbelief) among the mass of the
people? Only the blind can fail to see this. The ideological bloc of all the
Menshevik Social-Democrats, including the Bundists, with the Cadets is an
accomplished fact, and articles like that written by Comrade M. are
well-meaning, but simple-minded, platonic dreams.

The tsarist government steadily continues its “work” to falsify the
Duma. Warning the credulous Russian public not to be carried away by
constitutionalism, we wrote, even before these falsifications began (see
Proletary, No. 5, September 30,1906), that a new coup d’état was in
preparation, namely, that the electoral law of December 11, 1905, was to be
amended before the elections to the Second Duma. At that time we wrote:
“Nor is there any doubt that the government is carefully studying”
the question “whether the old electoral law should remain in

       force”.[1]


Yes, the tsar’s government has been studying this question and, perhaps, has
already even completed its study. It has preferred to amend the electoral law by
means of Senate interpretations.[3]

Now it is taking further steps in the direction of restricting freedom
of agitation (if freedom in Russia can be further restricted)
and faking the elections. The other day an order was
promulgated prohibiting the issue of election forms to unregistered
parties.[4]

Newspapers are being more and more summarily
suppressed. Arrests are becoming more and more frequent. Premises are being
raided and searched with the most transparent object of obtaining the names of
electors and influential voters, in order to “remove” them. In
short, the election campaign is in full swing, as the witticism of Russian
citizens puts it.


How far the government will go with its military-court methods of falsifying the
Duma, no one can tell. Why not arrest the electors both on election day and
after the elections?

    

    The law—that stupid word still has currency in
    Russia!—speaks of the immunity of members of the Duma, but there is not a
    word in it about the immunity of electors. Our press pointed this out even
    during the elections to the First Duma. The Black-Hundred tsarist gang
    thought that “Witte missed his chance” on that occasion; hut in
    fact the government was still too weak after the December uprising to go on
    and capture the revolution’s next line of defence. Now the
    counter-revolution has gathered strength, and is doing the right thing, from
    its point of view, in breaking the constitution (which only naive Cadets
    could believe in). The reactionaries are not liberal
    Balalaikins.[5]

They are men of action. They see, and know from experience, that the
    tiniest bit of freedom in Russia inevitably leads to an upsurge of the
    revolution. They are therefore compelled to go farther and
    farther, to do more and more violence to the October Constitution, to
    tighten still further the political safety valve that once was half open.


It takes the infinite obtuseness of a Russian Cadet, or of a non-party
progressive intellectual, to cry out, on that account, about the government’s
folly and urge it to return to the path of constitutionalism. The government
cannot act otherwise in protecting the tsarist regime and landlordism
from the concealed, subdued, but unquelled pressure from be low. And we say to
the government: All right, put your dampers on, tighten the half-opened
valves. While they were somewhat open the fresh draught increased the heat in
the boiler. When you close the valves there may be an explosion of the very kind
we most desire. Our business is to make the utmost use among the masses of
Stolypin’s splendid propaganda, of his splendid explanations of the
“nature of the constitution”.


But here we see the deep gulf that separates the tactics of the
liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie from the tactics of the socialist
proletariat. The Social-Democrats advocate a struggle, and explain to the people
with the aid of a thousand and one lessons from history that a struggle is
inevitable; they are preparing for it and retaliate to the intensification of
reaction with intensified revolutionary agitation. The liberals cannot advocate
a struggle, because they are afraid of it. They respond to the intensification
of reaction

    

by whining about a constitution, thus corrupting people’s minds, and by
intensified opportunism. The methods of the liberals were aptly and graphically
hit off by the Trudovik Sedelnikov at a meeting on May 9 in the Panina
Palace. When a liberal is abused, he says: Thank God they didn’t beat me. When
he is beaten, he thanks God they didn’t kill him. When he is killed, he will
thank God that his immortal soul has been delivered from its mortal clay.


When Stolypin’s Black-Hundred gang cried out against the Cadets and launched a
campaign against their revolutionary tendencies, the Cadets began to howl:
“It is not true, we are not revolutionaries, we are respectable people!
Down with the Vyborg Manifesto, down with blocs with the Lefts, down with the
slogan of ’a Duma with full power’ advocated by the most Right-wing of the Right
Social-Democrats, Plekhanov; down with pernicious revolutionary illusions! We
are going into the Duma to legislate.” When the Black-Hundred gang announced
that the Cadets, as an unregistered party, would not be issued election forms,
the Cadets cried out:

“That puts a different complexion on the question of agreements!” (See the
leading article in Rech, December 13). That increases the importance
of the only registered party of the opposition, the Party of Peaceful
Renovation”. “When entering into agreements this must be taken into
consideration!” And when the Cadet elector who has managed to creep into the
Peaceful Renovation list is hauled off to the police station—the Cadets
will thank God that we have not been completely deprived of the
constitution. Our knights of the law will then say: The only absolutely safe
party is that of the Octobrists; and have we not always said that we take our
stand on the Manifesto of October 17?


What do the Menshevik comrades think about this? Should we not hasten to call a
new Party conference and sanction agreements with the Peaceful Renovators and,
perhaps, even with the Octobrists? After all, they, too, want
“semi-liberty”, as the extremely embarrassed Plekhanov argues today
(December 14) in the newspaper of the ex-Social Democrats!


It is not by accident that the question of the Peaceful Renovators has cropped
up among the Cadets. It had been raised before, prior to the order concerning
the issue of

    

election forms. Even the Left Cadets on Tovarishch (the “almost
socialists”, as some jesters call them) in their issue of December 5
included the Peaceful Renovators among the
progressive parties, counting six progressive parties in all
(the Cadets, the Social-Democrats, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Popular
Socialists, the Party of Democratic Reforms and the Party of Peaceful
Renovation). In the same issue of Tovarishch the ex-Social-Democrats
poured their wrath on the poster about the three main parties published
as a supplement to Proletary, No.

  8.[2]

It is “political dishonesty”, cried Plekhanovs friends—b
relegate Heyden to the Black Hundreds!


We are very glad that we have compelled the renegade Social-Democrats to defend
this former Octobrist, who after the dissolution of the Duma, protested against
the Vyborg Manifesto and negotiated with Stolypin about the Cabinet.


But you gentlemen, collaborators of Plekhanov, should have been more adroit in
your defence of him! It is common knowledge that in the first elections the
Octobrists (including Heyden and Shipov) formed a bloc with the Black
Hundreds. You are prepared to forget this because the party has changed its name?
And yet on that very page (4) of Tovarishch, December 5, we read that
there is a trend in the Union of October Seventeenth which is in favour of an
agreement with the Party of Peaceful Renovation, and that this trend even
predominates in the St. Petersburg branch of the Union. And a little lower down
we read that “the Central Board of the United Russian People”
sanctions blocs with the Octobrists, and for that reason Tovarishch
refuses to recognise the Octobrists as constitutionalists.


Isn’t that fine? We refuse to call the Octobrists constitutionalists because
the Black Hundreds sanction blocs with them. But we call the Peaceful Renovators
progressives, despite the fact that the Octobrists sanction blocs with them.


Oh, those sapient gudgeons of our notorious progressive “intelligentsia”!


The intellectualist radicals’. defence of the Peaceful Renovators, the turn
taken by the central organ of the Cadet Party towards peaceful renovation
immediately after the

    

order on election forms was issued, are typical examples of liberal tactics. If
the government takes one step to the right, we take two steps to the right! Lo
and behold —again we are legal and peaceful, tactful and loyal; we shall
manage without election forms, we are always ready to adapt our selves in
conformity with infamy![6]


The liberal bourgeoisie think that this is realist politics. They are proud of
this grovelling realism (to use the admirable expression of a certain
Social-Democrat), they consider it the height of political tact and wise
diplomatic tactics. In actual fact, these are not only the most stupid and
treacherous, but the most sterile tactics imaginable; it was by pursuing these
tactics that the German Cadets—from the Frankfort windbags to Bismarck’s
bootlicking national liberals[7]—for

more than half a century
after the bourgeois revolution consolidated the state power in the hands of the
Junkers (the Black-Hundred landlords, the Dorrers, Bulatsels and
Purishkeviches—to name their Russian counterparts) and in the hands of
“military despotism embellished with parliamentary
forms”.[8]


It is time our Mensheviks, who are so enamoured of this policy of the Cadets and
are imitating it, understood that the only realist politics, realist in the good
and not vulgar sense of the word, are the politics of revolutionary Marxism. We
must retaliate to the tricks and manoeuvres of the reactionaries not by
adapting ourselves to the Right, but by intensifying and spreading our
revolutionary propaganda among the proletarian masses, by developing the spirit
of revolutionary class struggle and revolutionary class organisations. In this
way, and only in this way, will you strengthen the power of the only fighters
against reaction, in spite of all the latter’s tricks and
manoeuvres. Retaliating to the Black-Hundred tricks of the government by
adapting your tactics to the Right you break up and weaken the only force that
is capable of fighting, the force of the revolutionary classes, you obscure
their revolutionary consciousness with the tinsel of tricky political
“manoeuvres”.


At first the Mensheviks were opposed to agreements with the Cadets. Martov
condemned agreements. Y. Larin indignantly rejected them. Even
Nich. I—sky disapproved of them. Influenced by the Senate interpretations
(by our reactionary

    

      senates in Geneva and in St. Petersburg) Martov & Co. adapted
      themselves to the Right. They are in favour of blocs with the Cadets, but
      not with any one further to the Right than the Cadets—heaven forbid!
      With the “opposition democratic parties” (the resolution of I
      Lie All-Russian Conference, proposed by the Central Committee and adopted
      by 18 votes to 14), but no further to the Right!


But now the Cadets are turning to the Peaceful Renovators. And are you,
Menshevik comrades, going to do the same? In answer to the Senate
interpretations—blocs with the Cadets; in answer to the withdrawal of
election forms—blocs with the Peaceful Renovators? What will your answer
be when they start arresting the electors??


You have already abandoned real revolutionary propaganda among the masses. You
are no longer combating illusions about peaceful evolution and those who are
spreading these illusions—the Cadets. All you are concerned about is the
Black-Hundred danger. But your “subtle manoeuvres” of joint election
lists with the Cadets are built on sand. You are impoverishing the real content
of revolutionary Social-Democratic work among the masses, but the gains from
this political trickery will not accrue to you, perhaps not even to the
Cadets—perhaps not even to the Peaceful Renovators, but to the Octobrists!
You reply to the falsification of the Duma by falsifying revolutionary
Social-Democratic tactics—but in this way you will neither improve the
Duma, nor strengthen socialism, nor advance the cause of revolution.


Unprincipled practical politics are the most unpractical politics.


The working class must reply to the falsification of the Duma not by relaxing
but by intensifying its revolutionary agitation, by dissociating itself in its
election campaign from these wretched traitors, the Cadets.

After the dissolution of the Duma the government was able to hold the
indignation of the country in check only by means of military terror. The
special and emergency security regulations, endless arrests, military courts,
punitive expeditions—all these taken together cannot be called any thing
but military terror.


The government used this military suppression of the movement for freedom as a
test of its own strength. If we are strong enough—we shall not convene the
Duma at all, and at once satisfy the desires of the Union of the Russian People
and similar “truly Russian” Black-Hundred parties. If we are not
strong enough—we shall convene it once more, we shall try to modify the
electoral law, try to ensure a Black-Hundred Duma, or to tame a Cadet
Duma. That is how the government reasoned.


The military strength of ruthless repression has only sufficed, so far at
least, to enable the government, by means of Senate interpretations and in
violation of the law, to deprive thousands and tens of thousands of workers,
poor peasants and railwaymen of the right to vote. The government’s financial
difficulties have increased enormously. It has failed, so far, to obtain a
loan. Inevitable bankruptcy is staring it in the face. There is not a single
party in the country it can rely on, and it is oscillating between the hooligan
gangs (the true Russians) and the Octobrists. It has been unable to reach full
agreement even with the Octobrists.


Such are the conditions in which the election campaign for the Second Duma is
being inaugurated. The ordinary man in the street is cowed. He has been
intimidated by the military

    

courts. He is under the spell of the government’s boast that the Duma will be
      docile. He yields to this mood and is ready to forgive the Cadets all
      their mistakes, to throw overboard all that the First Duma taught him and
      vote for the Cadets if only the Black Hundreds arc kept out.


That the ordinary man in the street should behave in this way is natural. He is
never guided by a definite world-outlook, by principles of integral party
tactics. He always swims with the stream, blindly obeying the mood of the
moment. He cannot reason in any other way than by contrasting the most moderate of
all the opposition parties to the Black Hundreds. He is incapable of thinking
for himself over the experience of the First Duma.


But what is natural for the ordinary man in the street is unpardonable for a
party man, and altogether reprehensible for a Social-Democrat. Listen to the
arguments of those Social-Democrats who are calling on the socialist workers
to vote for the Cadets (it makes no difference whether it is only for
Cadets in constituencies where the Social-Democrats have refrained from putting
up their own candidates, or for Cadets and Social-Democrats where there is a
joint list). Instead of arguments you will hear only one refrain, a cry of
terror and despair: Don’t let the Black Hundreds in! Vote for the Cadets! Draw
up joint lists with the Cadets!


A Social-Democrat, a member of the worker’s party,

can not 

stoop to such
philistine behaviour. He must clearly understand what actual social forces are
engaged in the struggle, the real significance of the Duma in general, and of
the Cadet Party, which predominated in the First Duma, in particular. Whoever
argues about the present policy of the proletariat without thinking over all
these questions will never arrive at anything like correct conclusions,


What is the issue in the present struggle in Russia? It is a fight for freedom,
i.e., a fight for state power to be in the hands of the representatives of the
people and not in the hands of the old government. It is a fight for land for
the peasants. The government is opposing these strivings with all its might,
fighting to retain its power, its land (for the richest landlords are among the
most aristocratic and most highly placed persons in the state). Opposed to the
government are the workers and the mass of the poor peasantry,

    


    

and also, of course, the urban poor, about whom there is no need to speak
      separately since they have no special interests that differ from the
      fundamental interests of the proletariat and the peasantry.


What is the attitude of the upper classes, the landlords and the bourgeoisie, to
this struggle? At first—until October 17, a great number of them were
liberals, i.e., they sympathised with the cause of liberty, and in one way or
another even helped the workers in their struggle. The bourgeoisie was
dissatisfied with the autocratic system of government and demanded a voice in
state affairs. The bourgeoisie called itself democratic, i.e., claimed to stand
for the people’s freedom, in order to obtain the people’s backing for its
aspirations. But after October 17 the bourgeoisie was satisfied with what it had
received, i.e., participation of the landlords and capitalists in state affairs
and the promises of freedom made by the old regime, which remained intact. The
bourgeoisie was frightened by the independent struggle of the proletariat and
the peasantry, and proclaimed: “We have had enough of revolution!”


Before October 17 there was one all-inclusive liberal bourgeois party of the
Zemstvo people, who assembled at their famous semi-legal congresses and
published abroad the journal Osvobozhdeniye. After October 17 the
participants in these Zemstvo congresses split: the capitalist business men and
the bigger landlords, or landlords who conducted their estates on feudal lines,
joined the Octobrist Party, i.e., openly went over to the government. The other
section, mainly lawyers, professors and other bourgeois intellectuals, formed
the Cadet Party (the Constitutional-Democrats). This party also turned against
the revolution; it, too, was frightened by the workers’ struggle; it, too,
proclaimed:

“Enough!” But it wanted, as it wants now, to stop the struggle by more
subtle means, by small concessions to the people, land for the peasants with
compensation, etc. The Cadet Party promised that if its members were elected to
the Duma it would give the people liberty and the peasants land. The
Social-Democrats realised that the Cadets were deceiving the people and
therefore boycotted the Duma. But the ignorant peasants and the cowed ordinary
citizens nevertheless elected the Cadets to the Duma. Instead of fighting for
liberty

    

      when they got into the Puma, the Cadets began to appeal to the people to
      keep calm, while they themselves strove to obtain appointments as the
      tsar’s Ministers. The Duma was dissolved because speeches were delivered
      there that displeased the powers that be, because the Social-Democrats
      and the bolder deputies addressed the people from the Duma tribune,
      calling on them to fight.


Even the blindest or the most ignorant people must now realise what the Cadet
Party really is. It is not a party of the champions of the people; it is a party
of bourgeois petitioners, middlemen and hucksters. The workers and
intelligent peasants will be able to achieve their aims only when the masses cease to
believe in the Cadet Party, when the masses realise the necessity of an
independent struggle. Therefore, to vote for the Cadets, or advocate voting for
the Cadets, means misleading the masses, undermining their solidarity and
hindering them in preparing for the struggle.


The class-conscious workers are now confronted by quite a different task. They
must combat philistine confusion and lack of principles with consistent,
steadfast, co-ordinated socialist propaganda during the election campaign.


The immediate task of the class-conscious workers is to explain to the
proletarian masses and to all the progressive peasants the real nature of the
struggle, the actual position of the various classes in this struggle.


The workers have progressed more than any other class in the course of our
revolution. They are now coming over en masse to the
Social-Democrats. More intense and more

ex tensive 

work must, of course, be
carried on among them; but here the road has been well explored. Work among the
peasants is much more important and much more difficult. The peasants are a
class of small proprietors. That class is far less favourably situated in regard
to the struggle for liberty and the struggle for socialism than the
workers. The peasants are not united by working in big enterprises; on the
contrary, they are disunited by their small individual farming. Unlike the
workers, the peasants do not see before them an open, obvious, single enemy in
the person of the capitalist. The peasants themselves are to a certain extent
masters and proprietors. That is why they always trail be hind the bourgeoisie
and try to imitate it. Their ambition is

    

to develop and consolidate their small property; and not to fight in a common
struggle with the working class against the capitalist class.


That is why the mass of the poor peasants have always and in every country
proved to be less persistent in their struggle for liberty and for socialism
than the workers. That is why, in this country, the peasant deputies in the
Duma, the Trudoviks, have so far not succeeded, in spite of all the lessons of
Cadet treachery, in casting off the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, its
views, its prejudices and its political methods—methods which are supposed
to be cunning and subtle, to consist of fine “manoeuvres”, where as
in fact they are stupid, futile and disgraceful for every genuine fighter.


Class-conscious workers! Take advantage of the election campaign to open the
eyes of the people! Do not yield to the persuasions of these well-meaning but
feeble and irresolute people who are urging you to put up joint lists with the
Cadets, and to obscure the minds of the masses by means of joint slogans with
the Cadets. Do not believe the stock cries and warnings about the Black-Hundred
danger. The real and fundamental danger that confronts the Russian revolution
is the immaturity of the peasant masses, their lack of staunchness in the
struggle, their failure to understand the shallowness and treachery of bourgeois
liberalism. Fight against that danger, tell the whole truth openly to the mass
of the people. In that way you will draw them away from the Cadet windbags and
gain their support for the Social-Democrats. Only in this way will you be able
to combat the real Black-Hundred danger. No Senate interpretations, no
executions, no arrests can prevent the people from carrying on such work,
the work of raising the civic and class consciousness of the masses to a higher
level, of organising them to fight for their own and not liberal-bourgeois aims
in the struggle.

The Volga Region is one of the big centres of the peasant movement. The
particularly urgent task confronting the workers’ party there is: to carry out
the independent class policy of the proletariat, while constantly explaining to
the peasant masses that they can win land and liberty only by breaking with
their customary leaders from among the Liberal landlord-Cadets, only by joining
with the revolutionary proletariat.


It is to this task, too, that the election campaign of the workers’ party should
be wholly subordinated. For this very reason, blocs with the Cadets—which
in general are impermissible because of the whole position in principle of the
Social-Democratic Party as the party leading the class struggle of the
proletariat—are particularly harmful in the Volga Region. To show this
more clearly, let us take the example of a peasant deputy to the First Duma from
the Volga Region. This deputy is Mr. I. Zhilkin, a Trudovik elected from
Saratov Gubernia.


Trudovik Zhilkin is now writing in the St. Petersburg Cadet newspaper
Tovarishch and defending blocs with the Cadets. But see how he
defends such blocs. In Tovarishch of December 17 he describes the
elections to the First Duma in Saratov Gubernia. The peasants elected their own
people, instinctively—with the true instinct of the working and exploited
people—distrusting the liberal landlord and bourgeois lawyer. In the
gubernia, when all the electors had gathered for the election of the Duma
deputies, the peasants comprised about two-fifths of the total.

 

(Let us recall that the total number of electors in Saratov Gubernia was 150. Of
      these, 64 were from the peasants, 51 from the landowners and 35 from the
      townsfolk. Mr. Zhilkin gives the number as 152 electors, perhaps adding
      the workers’ curia.)


The peasant electors in the gubernia came up against “prominent”
Cadets like Mr. N. N. Lvov, “attached to the Central Committee of the
Cadet Party”. Among the electors from the uyezd towns some people proved
to be more to the left than the Cadets. And very rapidly, almost of itself, a
Left bloc was formed, an “Alliance of the Working People”, the germ
of the future Trudovik Group in the Duma.


Haggling with the Cadets for seats in the Duma began. The Cadets demanded
two-thirds of the seats for the Constitutional-Democrats, the “working
people” demanded the same for themselves. No agreement was reached. The
Cadets did not believe in the strength and solidarity of the alliance of the
working people. At the last election meeting, however, it turned out that the
candidates of the alliance obtained from 78 to 89 votes out of the
total of 152. “The chief candidates of the Cadets obtained from 50 to
67.”


Then the Cadets surrendered. They agreed to their party being in the minority in
the Duma. “The committee of the alliance of the working people agreed to
secure the election of two candidates under the Cadet flag: N. N. Lvov and
S. A. Kotlyarevsky. “And it was typical,” writes Mr. Zhilkin, “that
these candidates who had only obtained 59 and 67 votes at the election meeting,
received 111 votes at the poll.”


Yes, this is very, very typical. Only unfortunately Trudovik Zhilkin does not
understand the significance of the facts he reports.


Just think: the left Alliance of the Working People, disposing of 78-89 votes
out of 152, i.e., the majority, secured the election of N. N. Lvov to
the Duma. And so Mr. Zhilkin, the Trudovik, defends blocs with the Cadets.


Do you know, workers and peasants, what sort of a man N. N. Lvov is? He is a
landlord, one of the founders of the “Osvobozhdeniye
League”, i.e., one of the founders of the Cadet Party. For seven years he
served as a Marshal of the Nobility. In the Duma he belonged to the most Right
wing Cadets. In other words, he not only opposed the Social-

    

      Democratic worker deputies and the Trudoviks, but even found that the whole
      Cadet Party was too far to the left! He found that the Cadet Draconian
      laws on assembly and the press were too liberal and the ruinous
      compensation payment which the Cadet landlords proposed for the peasants
      was a reform too generous to the peasants. The Cadets wanted to sell land
      to the peasants at a just valuation, this just valuation to be arrived at
      by a body with an equal number of representatives of the peasants and the
      landlords and with the addition of representatives of t e government. One
      peasant, one landlord, one police official—was this not a truly
      beautiful example of Cadet justice! But to the landlord Mr. Lvov it seemed
      altogether too liberal. Apparently he would have liked more police
      officials on the local land committees.


Consequently Mr. Lvov delivered speeches in the Duma against the
peasants’ demand for land. During the period of the Duma Mr. Lvov hastened to
make his way by the back stairs to the powers that be in order to haggle over
ministerial seats for the liberal landlords in return for “curbing”
the Trudoviks and Social-Democrats in the Duma. That’s the sort of man he is,
this liberal landlord Lvov, elected to the Duma by the Trudoviks. And after the
dissolution of the Duma landlord Lvov had talks with Stolypin about entering
the Stolypin Cabinet!!


In order to talk more freely with Stolypin, Lvov left the Cadets and formed the
Party of Peaceful Plunder. The Cadets are now entering into a bloc with
this party. The newspaper Tovarishch, for which Mr. Zhilkin
writes, calls it a progressive and not a Black-Hundred party!


What is important for us is that Lvov was a Cadet when he entered the Duma. What
is important is that the Cadet landlord betrayed the peasants in the most vile
fashion, fighting against their demands in the Duma and even after the
dissolution of the Duma haggling for a ministerial seat with people who were
responsible for shooting and flogging masses of peasants.


That is the sort of Cadet landlords the Trudoviks elected to the Duma!


Let us suppose that at that time Mr. Zhilkin and the other Trudoviks
did not know what kind of an animal this Lvov

    

was. Let us suppose that Mr. Zhilkin & Co. made a mistake. One
cannot be condemned for making a mistake.


Very well. But is it possible that at the present time Mr. Zhilkin does not know
how the Cadet landlords like Lvov have gone over from “people’s
freedom” to the Stolypin military-court Cabinet? Mr. Zhilkin does know
this; nevertheless he advises the Trudoviks and Social-Democratic
workers to enter into a bloc with the party of the liberal landlords and
bourgeois lawyers, with the Party of the Cadets.


Lvov is an example of the Cadet traitor, an example of the liberal landlord
party.


Zhilkin is an example of the unintelligent and vacillating Trudovik who trails
in the wake of the “liberal” landlords, incapable of opening the
eyes of the peasants, incapable of gaining a victory even when in the majority,
incapable of rallying the peasants to independent struggle.


Let all the class-conscious workers, all the Social-Democrats of the Volga
Region, use the example of Lvov and Zhilkin to teach the people.


Workers! Do you want to help elect to the Duma Cadets like the landlord Lvov,
who one day delivers orations on people’s freedom and the next day goes over to
the side of Stolypin?


If you do not want this, reject all blocs with the Cadets, with this party of
“liberal” landlords. Call upon the peasants to support the
Social-Democratic Labour Party and not the Party of the
Constitutional-Democrats.


Peasants! Do you want once more to elect to the Duma “liberal”
landlords like the Cadet Lvov, who prior to the Duma promised you a land flowing
with milk and honey, but when in the Duma proposed a just valuation of the
landlords’ land by officials appointed by the landlords’ government? Do you want to
entrust defence of peasant demands to the liberal landlords and bourgeois
lawyers?


If you do not want this, vote for the Social-Democrats, i.e., for the
workers’ party. Nowhere in the world has the Social-Democratic Labour Party
betrayed the interests of the ruined, impoverished, toiling and exploited
peasantry.  Throughout the world the liberal bourgeoisie has deceived

    

the peasants fighting for land and liberty just as the Cadets like Lvov are
      deceiving them in this country.


There is not and cannot be any other remedy against the wobbling of the
Trudoviks than a strong, class-conscious workers’ party that never departs from
the class standpoint. The peasants can win land and liberty only by marching
hand-in-hand with the class-conscious workers.

Liebknecht’s pamphlet, the translation of which is now offered to the Russian
reader, is of special interest at the present time, on the eve of the elections
to the Second Duma, when the question of electoral agreements has aroused keen
interest in the workers’ party and among the liberal bourgeoisie.


We shall not dwell here on the general importance of Liebknecht’s pamphlet. The
reader will have to consult Franz Mehring’s history of the German
Social-Democratic movement and a number of other works by our German comrades to
obtain a clear idea of its importance and to understand correctly certain
passages in it which are liable to misinterpretation if divorced from the
situation at the time they were written.


The important thing for us here is to note Liebknecht’s method of
reasoning, to show how he approached the question of agreements, so as
to help the Russian reader to make his own approach to the solution of the
question that interests us, viz., that of blocs with the Cadets.


Liebknecht does not in the least deny that agreements with the bourgeois
opposition parties are “useful” both from the standpoint of
obtaining “seats in parliament” and from the standpoint of enlisting
an “ally” (a supposed ally) against the common
enemy—reaction. But the true political acumen and the staunch
Social-Democratism of this veteran German socialist are revealed by the fact
that he does not limit
    

himself to these considerations. He examines the question whether the
    “ally” is not an enemy in disguise whom it would he particularly
    dangerous to admit to our ranks; whether and in what way he actually fights
    against the common enemy; whether agreements, while being useful as a means
    of obtaining a larger number of seats in parliament, are not detrimental to
    the more permanent and more profound aims of the proletarian party.


Let us take at least the three questions I have indicated, and see whether an
advocate of agreements between the Russian Social-Democrats and the Cadets like
Plekhanov, for instance, understands their implications. We shall see
that Plekhanov’s presentation of the question of agreements is extremely
narrow. The Cadets want to fight reaction, therefore ... agreements with the
Cadets! Beyond this Plekhanov does not go; he thinks it would be doctrinaire to
go any further into the question. Small wonder that a Social-Democrat so
forgetful of the requirements of Social-Democratic policy should find himself in
the company of and in collaboration with renegade Social-Democrats like
Prokopovich and the other publicists of Tovarishch. Small wonder that
even the Mensheviks, who share the principles of this Social-Democrat, either
maintain an embarrassed silence, not daring to say aloud what they think of
Plekhanov, and repudiating him at workers’ meetings, or simply laugh at him,
like the Bundists in Volkszeitung and Nasha
Tribuna.[1]


Liebknecht teaches us that a Social-Democrat must be able to expose the
dangerous aspects of every ally in the bourgeois camp and not conceal them. Our
Mensheviks, how ever, cry out that we must fight not the Cadets but the
Black-Hundred danger! It would be useful for these people to ponder over the
following words of Liebknecht: “The stupid and cruel outrages perpetrated
by the police politicians, the encroachments of the Anti-Socialist Law, the
Draconian law, the law against parties that advocate revolution, may evoke
feelings of contempt and pity; but the enemy who proffers us his hand for an
electoral agreement and worms his way into our ranks as a friend and brother is
the enemy, the only enemy we have to fear.”


You see, Liebknecht, too, takes police outrages and

Black hundred 

laws into account. Nevertheless, he tells the workers

    

boldly: it is not this enemy that we must fear, but an electoral agreement
with a false friend. Why did Liebknecht think so? Because he always regarded the
strength of fighters as real strength only when it is the strength of
class-conscious masses of workers. The class-consciousness of the
masses is not corrupted by violence and Draconian laws; it is corrupted by the
false friends of the workers, the liberal bourgeois, who
divert the masses from the real struggle with empty phrases about a
struggle. Our Mensheviks and Plekhanov fail to understand that the fight against
the Cadets is a fight to free the minds of the working masses from false Cadet
ideas and prejudices about combining popular freedom with the old regime.


Liebknecht laid so much emphasis on the point that false friends are more
dangerous than open enemies that he said: “The introduction of a new
Anti-Socialist Law would be a lesser evil than the obscuring of class
antagonisms and party boundary lines by electoral agreements.”


Translate this sentence of Liebknecht’s into terms of Russian politics at the
end of 1906: “A Black-Hundred Duma would be a lesser evil than the
obscuring of class antagonisms and party boundary lines by electoral agreements
with the Cadets.” If Liebknecht had said this, what a howl would have been
raised against him by those who have deserted socialism for the liberals and are
now writing for Tovarishch and similar newspapers! How often have we
heard the Bolsheviks “condemned” at workers’ meetings and in the
columns of the Menshevik press for expressing ideas similar to those for which
Liebknecht was attacked (see p. 54 of the pamphlet). But the Bolsheviks will be
as little intimidated by these howls and condemnations as Liebknecht was. Only
bad Social-Democrats can make light of the harm done to the working masses by
the liberal betrayers of the cause of the people’s liberty who ingratiate
themselves with them by means of electoral agreements.


Apropos of this treachery of the liberals. Our opportunists, Plekhanov among
them, cry: It is tactless in our country, and at the present time, to say that
liberalism is treacherous. Plekhanov has even written a whole pamphlet to teach
the tactless socialist workers to be polite to the Cadets. But Liebknecht’s
pamphlet clearly shows that

    

    Plekhanov’s ideas are second-hand and that his phrases have already been worn
    threadbare by the German bourgeois liberals. It transpires that the
    “trump card” that Plekhanov has been playing against the
    revolutionary Social-Democrats is the very same childish fable
    about the shepherd and the wolf that the German opportunists used to
    frighten Liebknecht with. The argument runs: people will get so accustomed to
    hearing you shout “wolf, wolf!” that when the wolf does come no one
    will believe you. Liebknecht had an apt answer for the present Plekhanov’s
    numerous kindred spirits in Germany: “In any case, the interests of
    the Party are not worse protected by cautious men than by scoffers.”


Let us take the second question: Are our bourgeois liberals, i. e., the Cadets,
really fighting against the Black-Hundred danger and if so, how? Plekhanov is
unable either to formulate that question or to answer it by a careful analysis
of Cadet policy in revolutionary Russia. Plekhanov, in violation of the
elementary principles of Marxism, deduces the concrete relations between the
Russian Social-Democrats and the Cadets from the “general concept”
bourgeois revolution, instead of studying the actual specific features of the
Russian bourgeois revolution in order to obtain a general conception of the
mutual relations between the bourgeoisie, the proletariat and the peasantry in
contemporary Russia.


Liebknecht teaches us to reason differently. When he was told that the bourgeois
liberals were fighting reaction, he replied by carefully analysing the
manner in which they were fighting. And he showed—in the present
pamphlet and in many other writings—that the German liberals (just like
our Cadets) were “betraying liberty”, that they were coming to an
understanding with the “Junkers [the landlords] and the clergy”;
that they had proved incapable of being revolutionary in a revolutionary epoch.


Liebknecht says: “As soon as the proletariat begins to come forward as a
class distinct from the bourgeoisie and in its interests hostile to the
bourgeoisie, the latter ceases to be democratic.”


But our opportunists, as if in mockery of the truth, call the Cadets democrats
(even in the resolutions of Social-Democratic Party conferences) in spite of
the fact that the Cadets repudiate democracy in their programme, recognise

    

the principle of an Upper Chamber, etc., and in spite of the fact that in the
State Duma they proposed Draconian laws against the holding of meetings and
opposed the formation, without permission from above, of local land committees
on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot!


Liebknecht quite rightly condemned the practice of using the word
“revolution” as a shibboleth. When he spoke of revolution, he really
meant it; he analysed all questions and all steps in tactics, not only
from the point of view of the interests of the moment, but also from
the point of view of the vital interests of the revolution as a
whole. Liebknecht, like the Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats, had had to
experience the painful transitions from direct revolutionary struggle to a
miserable, abominable and vile Black-Hundred constitution.

Liebknecht knew how to adapt himself to these painful transitions, he knew how
to work for the proletariat even in the most adverse circumstances.

But he did not rejoice at
passing from the fight against an infamous constitution to work under this
constitution, he did not jeer at those who had done everything to
prevent the emergence of such a “constitution”. By
“caution” Liebknecht did not mean kicking the revolution as soon as
it begins to decline (even though temporarily) and adjusting oneself as soon as
possible to a truncated constitution. No. By “caution” this veteran
of the revolutionary movement meant that a proletarian leader must be the last
to “adjust” himself to the conditions created by the temporary
defeats of the revolution; that he must not do so until long after the bourgeois
poltroons and cowards have done so. Liebknecht says: “Practical politics
forced us to adjust ourselves to the institutions of the society in which we
live; but every step we took in the direction of adjusting ourselves to the
present social order was hard for us, and we took it only with great
hesitation. This called forth no little ridicule from various
quarters. But he who fears to tread on this inclined plane is in any case a
more reliable comrade than he who leers at our hesitation.”


Remember these golden words, worker comrades who boycotted the Witte
Duma. Remember them especially when miserable pedants jeer at you for having
boycotted the Duma, forgetting that it was under the flag of the boycott of the

    

Bulygin Duma that. the first (and so far the only, but we are sure not the last)
      popular movement against institutions of that type flared up. Let
    the Cadet traitors be proud of having been the first voluntarily to crawl on
    their bellies under the laws of the counter-revolution. Class-conscious
    proletarians will be proud that they kept their colours flying and the open
    battle going longer than all the rest, that they fell only under heavy blows
    in the midst of the fray, and that they, longer than all the rest, continued
    their efforts and called upon the people to rise again and rush forward to
    a man, and crush the enemy.

 *     *  * 

Finally, let us take the third and last question. Will not electoral agreements
be prejudicial to what we hold most dear: “the purity of time
principles” of Social-Democracy? Alas! This question has already been
answered by the realities of Russian political life in facts which make
class-conscious workers blush with shame.


The Mensheviks assured us in their resolutions, vowed and swore at meetings that
they would go no further than technical agreements, that they would continue the
ideological struggle against the Cadets, that not for the world would they
swerve a hairbreadth from their Social-Democratic principles, from their purely
proletarian slogans.


And what was the outcome? No less a person than Plekhanov went knocking at the
door of the Cadet press so as to offer the people a “middle” slogan,
neither Cadet nor Social-Democratic, but agreeable to all and offensive to
none:

“a Duma with full power”. What does it matter if this slogan is a
downright deception of the people, that it throws dust in their eyes—so
long as there is an agreement with the liberal landlords! But the Cadets have
dismissed Plekhanov with contempt; and the Social-Democrats have turned away
from him, some with embarrassment, others with indignation. Now he is alone,
venting his spleen by railing against the Bolsheviks for their
“Blanquism”, against the writers on Tovarishch for their
“lack of modesty”, against the Mensheviks for their lack of
diplomacy, against everybody but himself! Poor Plekhanov! How cruelly the
candid,

    

plain, proud and outspoken words of Liebknecht’s on the harmfulness in principle
of agreements have proved justified in his case!


And “Comrade” Vasilyev (who has also peeped at the revolution from
the Swiss kitchen window) proposes in Tovarishch (December 17), with a
direct reference to Plekhanov, that we should simply dissolve the
Social-Democratic Party and temporarily—only temporarily!—merge with
the liberals. Yes, well might Liebknecht say that in the German Party, too,
there was hardly any one who wanted to deviate “from Party
principles”. But it is not a matter of what one wants, but of what the
force of circumstances drives the Party to for committing a false
step. Plekhanov, too, had the best of intentions: peace and good will with the
Cadets against the Black-Hundred danger; but the outcome was an infamy and
disgrace for the Social-Democrats.


Worker comrades, read Wilhelm Liebknecht’s pamphlet very carefully and be more
critical of those who advise you to enter into agreements with the Cadets, which
would be fatal to the proletariat and to the cause of liberty.

The progressive workers of Russia have long known K.Kautsky as their
writer, who is not only able to substantiate and expound the theoretical teaching
of revolutionary Marxism, but also to apply it intelligently, with a thorough
analysis of the facts, to the complex mid knotty problems of the Russian
revolution. And now, when the attention of the Social-Democrats is sometimes
almost entirely taken up with the pointless prattle of the liberal
Petrushkas[1]

and of their conscious and unconscious echoers, when for many people petty
“parliamentary” technicalities overshadow the fundamental questions
of the proletarian class struggle, and when despondency often gets the better
even of decent people and impairs their intellectual and political
faculties—now it is trebly important for all Social-Democrats in Russia to
pay close attention to Kautsky’s opinion on the fundamental problems of the
Russian revolution. And not so much to heed Kautsky’s opinion as to reflect on
the way he presents the question—for Kautsky is not so light-minded as to
hold forth on specific questions of Russian tactics with which he is but
slightly familiar; and not so ignorant of Russian affairs as to dismiss them
with commonplace remarks or uncritical repetition of the latest fashionable
pronouncements.


Kautsky answers the questions which Plekhanov addressed to a number of foreign
socialists. And in answering these questions—or rather, in selecting from
these badly formulated questions the points that can be usefully
discussed among socialists in all countries—Kautsky begins with a modest
reservation. “In regard to the Russian comrades, on matters that
concern Russia, I feel that I am in the position of a pupil.” This is
not the mock modesty of a Social-Democratic

    

“general” who begins with the mincing manners of a petty
bourgeois and ends with the haughtiness of a Bourbon. Not at all. Kautsky,
in fact, confined himself to answering only those questions by
analysing which he could help thinking Social-Democrats in Russia to
work out for themselves the problems connected with the concrete tasks and
slogans of the day. Kautsky refused to be a general who issues commands:
“Right turn!” or “Left turn!” He preferred to adopt the position of
a comrade standing at a distance, but a thoughtful comrade, indicating where we
ourselves should seek for a solution of our problems.


Plekhanov asked Kautsky:

1) What is the “general character” of the
Russian revolution: bourgeois or socialist?

2) What should be the attitude of the Social-Democrats to wards the bourgeois
   democrats?

3) Whether the Social-Democratic Party should support the
   opposition parties in the Duma elections.


At first sight these questions would seem to have been chosen with great
“finesse”, but as the saying goes: “If a thing is too fine, it
breaks.” In fact, any more or less competent and observant person will at once
see the fine ... subterfuge in these questions. A subterfuge,
firstly, because they are fine specimens of the metaphysics against which
Plekhanov is fond of declaiming so pompously, although he is unable to keep it
out of
his own arguments on concrete historical questions. Secondly, because the person
questioned is art fully driven into a small and exceedingly narrow
enclosure. Only those who are entirely, one may even say virginally, innocent in
questions of politics can fail to notice that Plekhanov deliberately starts out
remote from the subject and gently but firmly pushes the person he is
questioning into the position of justifying ... blocs with the Cadets!


To drive a simple-minded interlocutor into justifying blocs with a certain
party, without naming that party; to talk of a revolutionary movement and not
distinguish the revolutionary from the oppositional bourgeois democracy; to hint
that the bourgeoisie is “fighting” in its own way, i.e.,
different from the proletariat’s way, and not say plainly and clearly what the
difference really is; to try to catch the interlocutor like a young jackdaw with
the bait of the Amsterdam Resolution so as to conceal from the
foreigner

    

    the real points at issue among the Russian Social-Democrats; to deduce concrete
    rules concerning definite tactics in a definite case, in regard to the
    attitude to be adopted towards the various parties of the bourgeois
    democrats, from a general phrase about the “general
    character” of the revolution, instead of deducing this “general
    character of the Russian revolution” from a precise analysis of the
    concrete data on the interests and position of the different classes in the
    Russian revolution—is not all this a subterfuge? Is it not open
    mockery of Marx’s dialectical materialism?


Either “yea, yea—nay, nay, and whatsoever is more than these comes
from the evil one.” Either a bourgeois revolution or a socialist revolution; the
rest can be “deduced” from the main “solution” by means
of simple syllogisms.


It is Kautsky’s great merit that in answering such questions he at once grasps
the point and goes to the root of the mistake contained in the very way they
were formulated. Kautsky virtually answers Plekhanov’s questions by
rejecting Plekhanov’s formulation of them! Kautsky answers Plekhanov by
correcting Plekhanov’s formulation of the question. And the more
gently and carefully he corrects the initiator of the questionnaire the more
deadly is his criticism of his formulation of the question. Kautsky writes:
“We should do well to realise that we are moving towards totally new
situations and problems, for which none of the old patterns are suitable.”


This exactly hits the mark in relation to Plekhanov’s question: Is our
revolution bourgeois or socialist in its general character? This is the old
pattern, says Kautsky. The question cannot be put in that way, it is not the
Marxist way. The revolution in Russia is not a bourgeois revolution, for the
bourgeoisie is not one of the driving forces of the present revolutionary
movement in Russia. And the revolution in Russia is not a socialist revolution,
for it cannot possibly result in the sole rule or dictatorship
of the proletariat. The Social-Democrats can achieve victory in the Russian
revolution and must strive to do so. But victory in the present
revolution cannot be the victory of the proletariat alone, without the aid of
other classes. Which class then, owing to the objective conditions of the
present revolution, is the ally of the proletariat? The peasantry:
“stable, common

    

interests during the whole period of the revolutionary struggle exists only
between the proletariat and the peasantry.”


These propositions of Kautsky’s are a brilliant confirmation of the tactics of
the revolutionary wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, i.e., the tactics
of the Bolsheviks. And this confirmation is the more valuable because Kautsky,
putting aside the concrete and practical questions, concentrated all his
attention on a systematic exposition of the general principles of
socialist tactics in our revolution. He shows that Plekhanov’s threadbare method
of argument:

“the revolution is a bourgeois revolution, therefore we must support the
bourgeoisie”, has nothing in common with Marxism. He thus recognises the
main error of our Social-Democratic opportunism, i.e., Menshevism, which the
Bolsheviks have been combating ever since the beginning of 1905.


Further, Kautsky’s analysis, which proceeds not from general phrases but from an
analysis of the position and interests of definite classes, confirms the
conclusion which the yes-men of the Cadets in our ranks considered
“tactless”, namely: that the bourgeoisie in Russia fears revolution
more than reaction; that it hates absolutism because it engenders revolution;
that it wants political freedom in order to stop the revolution. Compare this
with the naive faith in the Cadets professed by our Plekhanov, who, in his
questions, has imperceptibly identified the struggle of the opposition against
the old order with the struggle against the government’s attempts to crush the
revolutionary movement! Unlike the Mensheviks with their stereotyped views,
Kautsky reveals the revolutionary and non-revolutionary elements of
“bourgeois democracy”, reveals the bankruptcy of liberalism, and
shows that as
the peasants become more independent and more politically conscious, the
liberals will inevitably and rapidly turn to the right. A bourgeois revolution,
brought about by the proletariat and the peasantry in spite of the instability
of the bourgeoisie—this fundamental principle of Bolshevik tactics is
wholly confirmed by Kautsky.


Kautsky shows that in the course of the revolution it is quite possible that
victory will fall to the lot of the Social-Democratic Party, and that that
Party must inspire its adherents with confidence in victory. Kautsky’s
conclusions completely confound the Menshevik fear of a Social-Democratic

    

victory in the present revolution. Plekhanov’s ridiculous efforts to
      “fit” the tasks of our revolution “into the Amsterdam
      Resolution” seem particularly comical when compared with Kautsky’s
      cleat and lucid proposition: “It is impossible to fight successfully
      if one renounces victory beforehand.”


The fundamental difference between Kautsky’s methods and those of
Plekhanov, the leader of our present opportunists, is even more striking when
the former states: to imagine that “all the classes and parties which are
striving for political freedom have simply to work together in order to achieve
it," means “seeing only the political surface of events”.
This sounds as though Kautsky were directly referring to that small band of
Social-Democrats who have deserted to the liberals: Portugalov, Prokopovich,
Kuskova, Bogucharsky, Izgoyev, Struve and others, who are committing the very
error Kautsky points to (and are dragging Plekhanov with them in the
process). The fact that Kautsky is unacquainted with the writings of these
gentry only enhances the significance of his theoretical conclusion.


Needless to say, Kautsky fully agrees with the fundamental thesis of
all Russian Social-Democrats, that the peasant movement is
non-socialist; that socialism cannot arise from small peasant
production, etc. It would be very edifying for the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
who are fond of asserting that they “also agree with Marx”, to
ponder over these words of Kautsky’s.


In conclusion just a few words about “authorities”. Marxists cannot
adopt the usual standpoint of the intellectual radical, with his
pseudo-revolutionary abstraction: “no authorities”.


No. The working class, which all over the world is waging a hard and persistent
struggle for complete emancipation, needs authorities, but, of course, only in
the way that young workers need the experience of veteran fighters
against oppression and exploitation, of those who have organised many strikes,
have taken part in a number of revolutions, who are wise in revolutionary
traditions, and have a broad political outlook. The proletarians of every
country need the authority of the world-wide struggle of the proletariat. We
need the authority of the theoreticians of international Social-Democracy

    

to enable us properly to understand the programme and tactics of our
Party. But, of course, this authority has nothing in common with the official
authorities in bourgeois science and police politics. It is the authority of
the experience gained in the more diversified struggle waged in the ranks of the
same world socialist army. And important though this authority is in widening
the horizon of the fighters, it would be impermissible in the workers’ party to
claim that the practical and concrete questions of its immediate policy can be
solved by those standing a long way off. The collective spirit of the
progressive class-conscious workers immediately engaged in the struggle in each
country will always remain the highest authority on all such questions.


Such is our view on the authoritativeness of the opinions held by Kautsky and by
Plekhanov. The theoretical works of the latter—mainly his criticism of the
Narodniks and the opportunists—remain a lasting asset for Social-Democracy
all over Russia, and no “factionalism” will blind any man who
possesses the least bit of “physical brain power” to such an extent
as to make him forget or deny the importance of this asset. But as a political
leader of the Russian Social-Democrats in the Russian bourgeois revolution, as
a tactician, Plekhanov has proved to be beneath criticism. In this sphere he
has displayed an opportunism a hundred times more harmful to the Russian
Social-Democratic workers than Bernstein’s opportunism is to the German
workers. And this Cadet-like policy advocated by Plekhanov, who has returned to
the fold of Prokopovich & Co. whom he, in 1899-1900, expelled from the
Social-Democratic Party, we must most ruthlessly combat.


That this tactical opportunism of Plekhanov’s is an utter negation of the
fundamentals of the Marxist method is best shown by Kautsky’s line of
argument traced in the essay here presented to the reader.

The papers are full of news about the preparations for the
elections. Almost every day we are informed either of a new government
“interpretation” striking out of the voters’ list one more category
of unreliable citizens, or of new persecutions, prohibitions of meetings,
suppression of news papers and the arrest of suspected electors or
candidates. The Black Hundreds have raised their heads, whooping and hooting
more insolently than ever.


The parties that are objectionable to the government are also preparing for the
elections. These parties are confident, and justly confident, that the
mass of the voters will have their say, will take advantage of the
elections to ex press their true convictions in spite of all the tricks,
pin-pricks and restrictions, great and small, that are directed against the
voters. This confidence is based on the fact that the most ferocious
persecutions, the most intolerable pin-pricks will at most eliminate hundreds,
thousands, let us say, tens of thousands of voters throughout Russia. But this
will not alter the sentiments and the attitude of the masses towards
the government. Ten or twenty thousand voters can be struck off the list in
St. Petersburg, say, but this will only cause the 150,000 voters in the capital
to withdraw into their shells, as it were, to lie low for a time. They will not
disappear, however, and their mass sentiment will not change; if it does change,
it will not, of course, be in favour of the government. Therefore, unless the
electoral law is radically amended, unless all remnants of electoral legality
are finally trampled upon (and they can still be further trampled upon by means
of systematic arrests of electors: one may

    

expect the very worst from Stolypin!)—there is still no doubt that the
mood of the masses will decide the elections, and the decision will certainly
not be in favour of the government and its Black Hundreds.


And all non-supporters of the government are placing their hopes in the masses
of the voters. But if you examine carefully what this hope in the masses really
amounts to, what the attitude of the various parties is towards the
masses—you will observe a vast difference between the bourgeois parties
and the party of the proletariat.


The Cadets are at the head of the liberal-bourgeois parties. During the
elections to the First Duma they shamefully betrayed the struggle, they refused
to take part in the boycott; they themselves went tamely to the elections and
drew the raw masses after them. Now they are placing their hopes on the
inertness of these masses, and on the restrictions which have been imposed on
agitation and on the Left parties in the conduct of their election
campaign. The Cadet’s hope in the masses is hope in the immaturity and servitude
of the masses. He argues as follows: the masses will not understand our
programme and tactics, they will not go beyond a peaceful and legal, the most
peaceful and timid protest—not because they do not wish to, but because
they will not be allowed to. They will vote for us, for the Lefts have no
newspapers, no meetings, no leaflets, no security against arbitrary arrest and
persecution. So thinks the Cadet. And he proudly raises his eyes to heaven and
says: I thank thee Lord that I am not as one of those “extremists”! I am
not a revolutionary; I shall be able to adjust myself most obediently and
abjectly to any measures; I shall even get my election

forms[1]

from the Peaceful Renovators.


Hence, the whole of the Cadets’ election campaign is directed to frightening the
masses with the Black-Hundred danger and the danger from the extreme Left
parties, to adapting themselves to the philistinism, cowardice and flabbiness
of the petty bourgeois and to persuading him that the Cadets are the safest, the
most modest, the most moderate and the most well-behaved of people. Every day
the Cadet papers ask their readers: Are you afraid, philistine? Rely

    

on us! We are not going to frighten you, we are opposed to violence, we are
      obedient to the government; rely on us, and we shall do everything for you
      “as far as possible”! And behind the backs of the frightened
      philistines the Cadets resort to eve ’y trick to assure the government of
      their loyalty, to assure the Lefts of their love of liberty, to assure the
      Peaceful Renovators of their affinity with their party and their election
      forms.


No enlightenment of the masses, no agitation to rouse the masses, no exposition
of consistent democratic slogans— only a haggling for seats behind the
backs of the frightened philistines—such is the election campaign of all
the parties of the liberal bourgeoisie, from the non-party people (of
Tovarishch) to the Party of Democratic Reforms.


The attitude of the workers’ party towards the masses is exactly the
reverse. The important thing for us is not to get seats in the Duma by means of
compromises; on the contrary, those seats are important only because and
insofar as they can serve to develop the political consciousness of the
masses, to raise them to a higher political level, to organise
them, not for the sake of philistine happiness, not for the sake of
“tranquillity”, “order” and “peaceful [bourgeois]
bliss”, but for the struggle, the struggle for the complete
emancipation of labour from all exploitation and all oppression. Only for this
purpose, and only to the extent that they help us to achieve it, are seats in
the Duma and the whole election campaign important for us. The workers’
party places all its hopes on the masses; on the masses who are not frightened,
not passively submissive and who do not humbly bear the yoke, but who are
politically conscious, demanding and militant. The workers’ party must treat
with contempt the usual liberal method of frightening the philistine with the
bogey of the Black-Hundred danger. The whole task of the Social-Democrats is to
make the masses conscious of the real danger, of the actual aims in the
struggle of these forces whose strength lies not in the Duma, which find full
expression not in Duma debates, and which will settle the question of Russia’s
future outside the Duma.


The workers’ party therefore warns the masses against the clandestine election
tricks of the Cadet bourgeoisie, against its stultifying cry: Entrust to us,
lawyers, professors

    

and enlightened landlords, the task of combating the Black Hundred danger!


The workers’ party tells the masses: trust only your socialist consciousness
and your socialist organisation. To surrender priority in the struggle and the
right to lead it to the liberal bourgeoisie is tantamount to selling the cause
of liberty for grandiloquent phrases, for the tawdry brilliance of fashionable
and gaudy signboards. No Black-Hundred danger in the Duma can be as harmful as
the corruption of the minds of the masses who are blindly following the liberal
bourgeoisie, its slogans, its candidates and its policy.


Among the masses to whom the workers’ party is appealing, the strongest
numerically are the peasants and various sections of the petty bourgeoisie. They
are more determined than the Cadets, more honest and a thousand times more
capable of fighting, but in politics they are too often led by the Cadet
windbags. Even now they are wavering between the militant proletariat and the
compromising bourgeoisie.


The advocates of blocs with the Cadets are not only doing harm to the
proletariat and to the whole cause of liberty. They are prejudicing the
development of political consciousness among the urban and rural poor. They are
not performing their immediate duty, which is to free these people from the
influence of the liberal bourgeoisie. Look at the Trudoviks, the “Popular
Socialists” and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. They, too, are wavering,
and are also mainly occupied with plans for deals with the Cadets. The leaders
of the Trudoviks, having failed to form a party of their own, are multiplying
their Duma mistakes tenfold by appealing to the masses to vote for the Cadets
(Anikin—through news paper reporters, Zhilkin—in
Tovarishch, etc.). This is down right treachery to the cause of the
peasants’ struggle, down right betrayal of the peasants to the liberal
landlords, who would rob the peasants by means of a “fair”
compensation as thoroughly as their forefathers did in 1861. And as for the
“Popular Socialists”, even the Cadets are laughing at them and
calling them “second reserve Cadets” (Milyukov in Rech).
Their leaders (Annensky and others) also appeal for blocs with the Cadets. Their
tiny party (which according to Tovarishch, a paper which is favourably
disposed to them, is weaker even than the party of peaceful plunder, and which

    

has only about 2,000 members throughout Russia!) is a mere appendage of the
      Cadets. The position of the Socialist-Revolutionaries is also ambiguous:
      both in the October period and in the period of the First Duma they
      concealed the fact that they had split with the Popular Socialists; they
      continued to collaborate with them and jointly published the same
      newspapers. Today, they are net conducting any open and independent
      struggle, are not sufficiently broadly, openly and sharply attacking the
      “second reserve Cadets”, are not supplying the masses with
      adequate data for criticising that party, and are not making any appraisal
      in principle of the whole election campaign and all electoral agreements
      in general.


It is the great historical duty of the workers’ party to help to create an
independent political party of the working class. Those who advocate
blocs with the Cadets hinder the fulfilment of this duty.


Another great duty that confronts the workers’ party is to free the masses of
the ruined, poverty-stricken and doomed urban petty bourgeoisie and peasantry
from the influence of the ideas and prejudices of the liberal bourgeoisie. The
fulfilment of this duty is also being hindered by those who advocate blocs with
the Cadets. They are not divorcing the peasants from the liberals, but are
strengthening this unnatural alliance, which is fatal to the cause of liberty
and to the cause of the proletariat. They are not warning the peas ant masses
against the liberals’ backstairs politics (or rather, political intrigue for
the distribution of seats in the Duma), but are sanctioning this intrigue by
taking part in it.


Down with all blocs! The workers’ party must conduct its election campaign
independently, not only in words, but in deeds. It must provide the whole
people, and the masses of the proletariat in particular, with a model of
courageous and consistent criticism based on principle. Only in that way shall
we succeed in rallying the masses for effective participation in the struggle
for freedom and not in the sham liberalism of the Cadet betrayers of freedom.

The attitude of the Menshevik Social-Democratic press towards Plekhanov’s
well-known Herostratian articles in Tovarishch deserves the attention
of the whole party of the working class. The most prominent representative of
the Menshevik trend, the leader of the Mensheviks, as all the liberal newspapers
openly and constantly call him, is publicly proposing a joint platform
for the Social-Democrats and Cadets.


And the Mensheviks are silent!


One would think that they had no newspapers, magazines, leaflets, institutions,
collegiums, not a single Party organisation. One would think that they were not
in the least concerned by what their leader says about their
policy in the hearing of all Russia....


But we are all perfectly aware that the Mensheviks possess both
organisations—even such influential ones as the Central
Committee—and organs of every type. Their silence, therefore, is only
another proof of the utter falsity of their position. The Bundists alone stand
out among the mass of the Mensheviks. They have protested against the slogan of
“a Duma with full power” in their Volkszeitung, which
unfortunately is almost unknown among the Russians. They have poured ridicule on
Plekhanov in their Nasha Tribuna, published in the Russian
language. They have thus proved, at any rate, that they have the courage of
their convictions, the courage to recognise in deed and not only in words their
own Party organisation, whose obligation it is openly and
straightforwardly to express its opinion on all political questions, and to
place its political duty to the proletariat above

    

all considerations of personal sympathy, friendship and respect of

     persons....[1]


What a disgraceful thing to happen in a workers’ party! The trend which
predominates in the Party and controls the Central Committee does not dare to
mention the mistakes of one of its members. At all meetings, at all
debates at which workers are present, at all discussions with the Bolsheviks,
the Mensheviks solemnly avow that they disagree with Plekhanov. But they are
silent about it in their press: not a single official declaration from
any Party unit. What is this? Repudiation in secret and confirmation by official
silence? Abuse the master ... behind his back and be silent in his
presence. Such things are done only by .. well, gentlemen, we’ll leave you to
guess who does such things.


But to the workers and the whole Party membership we say: You cannot trust
political leaders who disappear, bag and baggage, at the first surprise attack
from whatever quarter. They are not to be trusted. Whenever any final decision
is to be taken, all these “leaders” will act not as they
say but as some third person says for them.


By the way, the behaviour of Plekhanov and the Mensheviks in the present
incident is a good illustration of the current talk about the
“intellectualist” character of our Party. Yes, it is true that the
non-proletarian intelligentsia has far too much influence on the proletariat in
our Party. If that were not the case, would the proletarian party tolerate

    

Plekhanov’s antics and the Mensheviks’ attitude towards them even for a week?
How clearly this reveals the true nature of the talk about a non-party
labour congress. If only our Party were superseded by a legal labour (simply
labour, not Social-Democratic) party, as Larin and the publicists of Nashe
Dyelo and Sovremennaya Zhizn desire, there would be a wide field
for actions like Plekhanov’s. Write for any newspapers you please, enter into
any literary or political blocs with anyone you please, propose your
own slogans in your own name, completely ignoring any Party
organisation! Complete freedom for intellectualist individualism, while the mass
of non-party workers remains an amorphous mass. Is this not the ideal of the old
Prokopovich Credo (for which Plekhanov and I, in 1899-1900, attacked
Prokopovich and drove him and all his fraternity out of the Social-Democratic
Party)? The Credo—that quintessence of Social-Democratic
opportunism—advocated non-political, non-party labour unions for the
economic struggle, and political struggle through liberal channels. Blocs with
the Cadets and a non-party labour congress are nothing but a 1906-07 edition of
the Credo of 1899.


Plekhanov’s articles in Tovarishch are simply Larin’s proposal put into
practice: free propagandist societies for all and sundry
“socialists”—if they can be called socialists— against a
background of non-party labour organisations. In actual fact, Plekhanov
wrote in Tovarishch not as a member of the Party, not as a member of
one of the Party organisations. This is a fact which cannot be explained away
by any sophistry; and no “hushing up” of this fact by the Menshevik
Central Committee can save a certain faction in our Party. In fact, Plekhanov
wrote exactly as Larin wrote, as a non-party socialist in a non-party
“socialist” organ; and he put forward a non-party, non-socialist and
even anti-socialist proposal.


Vasilyev has followed in Plekhanov’s footsteps. Switzerland, owing to its
freedom from the traditions of the Russian revolutionary proletariat, is
supplying us with more and more “advanced” opportunists.


Vasilyev is a prominent Menshevik. He has worked with Mensheviks; not with
Mensheviks casually met in some remote provincial town, but with the most
prominent and most

    

responsible Mensheviks. Hence, the Mensheviks have no right to treat
    Vasilyev with disdain.


And Vasilyev directly refers to Plekhanov. More than that, he refers to him
in support of his own case. He calls Plekhanov’s disgraceful (for the
Social-Democratic Party) article in the Cadet press prop:sing a joint platform
with the Cadets “a courageous call”. He “regrets” that
“there are no Plekhanovs in the other parties”.


Vasilyev displays much zeal but little intelligence. He wanted to praise
Plekhanov, and in praise of him he blurt ed out: “Unfortunately there are
no Plekhanovs in the other parties.” This is matchless! Good Vasilyev was the
first to use the word “Plekhanovs” as a generic term for
politicians who act on their own account, and independently of their party. From
now on people xviii probably begin to speak of:

“the Plekhanovs in the Vasilyev sense of the word....”


Slapping “the Plekhanovs” on the back, the Vasilyevs dot the i’s and
cross the t’s. In 1899, the authors of the Credo, Prokopovich &
Co., spoke of a pure labour movement free from the germs of revolution. The
Vasilyevs talk of a revolution which must give birth to a
“constitution” and nothing more, and give birth to it
without the aid of mid wives, without revolutionaries. No
midwives, no revolutionaries, no revolutionary people—such is Vasilyev’s
slogan.


Shchedrin once poured classic ridicule on the France that was shooting the
Communards, the France of the bankers who were cringing before the Russian
tyrants. He called her a republic without republicans.[2]

It is time
a new Shchedrin was born to ridicule Vasilyev and the Mensheviks, who are
advocating revolution with the slogan of “no” revolutionaries,
“no” revolution.


Are we right in interpreting Vasilyev’s “pronouncement” in this
way? Are we right in putting him on a par with the Mensheviks?


Of course, we are! Vasilyev’s whole article, all his ideas, all his proposals
are imbued with the “plan” to facilitate the birth of a constitution
by killing the revolution. To “temporarily relinquish” all
programmes, to merge all Social-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and
suchlike with the Cadets in one liberal party, to unite them all for the
struggle for a “political constitution” “without the simultaneous

    

solution of economic programmes"(this is exactly what the letter
says—“without solution of programmes”. The Swiss advisers of the
Russian proletariat are not always able to express themselves in good
Russian)—does not all this evince a desire to save the constitution by
renouncing the revolution?


A revolution in the real, serious sense is inconceivable without
“solution of economic programmes”. A revolution can only be made by
the masses, actuated by profound economic needs. The fall of
absolutism in Russia, its real fall, would inevitably mean an
economic revolution. Only those who are virginally innocent of
socialism can fail to under stand this. To abandon economic programme means
abandoning the fundamental economic causes of revolution, abandoning the economic
interests which impel the masses of downtrodden, cowed, ignorant people to wage
a great and unprecedentedly selfless struggle. It means abandoning the masses,
leaving only a gang of intellectual spouters, and substituting liberal spouting
for socialist policy.


“What benefit was it to the peasants that their cause was espoused by the
Duma that was dissolved mainly on account of the agrarian question?” Does not
this argument entitle Vasilyev to have a monument erected to him in his lifetime
for socialist opportunism unsurpassed in the world?


And is this not (we now pass to the second of the two questions raised above) a
Menshevik argument?


Ride in the same compartment with the Cadets as far as Tver without disturbing
each other, says Plekhanov. Ride with the Cadets to the Duma, allying ourselves
with a non-revolutionary party (for a time! “for a short time!” says
Vasilyev, supplementing the Menshevik formula) for revolutionary
objects—say the Mensheviks. Ride together as far as a Cadet Cabinet, said
our Central Committee recently.


Yes, let’s ride, agrees Vasilyev, “without jostling or frightening
each other”. “Now, at this moment, it [the struggle of classes
and groups] is fatal and criminal.”


To wage the class struggle is criminal; to jeopardise the constitution by
revolutionary demands (such as: a Duma with full power, a constituent assembly,
etc.) is

criminal. however 

much the Mensheviks may repudiate Vasilyev (they have
not done so yet, by the by) they will never be able to

    

obliterate the fact that it is this idea that underlies blocs with the
    Cadets, support for the demand for a Duma Cabinet, and all these joint trips
    as far as Tver, etc., etc.


Vasilyev, of course, is unique. But even unique phenomena of nature occur only
in a definite environment and spring only from definite conditions. Vasilyev. of
course, is the Mont Blanc of opportunism. But one does not find Mont Blancs in
the steppes. They exist only among Alpine peaks. Vasilyevs can only appear in
company with the “Plekhanovs”, Cherevanins, and tutti
quanti down to Prokopovich.



And thanks to “the Plekhanovs in the Vasilyev sense” Mr. Struve is
able to say, as be did at a meeting in Solyanoi Gorodok on December 27
(Tovarishch of December 28) that “all the present opponents of
the Cadets will in the near future become Cadets
themselves. Tovarishch is already being called a Cadet paper. The
Popular Socialists are being called Social-Cadets, the
Mensheviks—semi-Cadets. Many people regard G. V. Plekhanov as a Cadet, and
indeed, many of his present utterances can be welcomed by the Cadets. It is a
pity only that he did not say these things when the Cadets stood alone. The
Bolsheviks alone may prove incorrigible, hence their fate will be to end up in a
museum of history.”


Thank you for the compliment, clumsy Mr. Struve! Yes, we shall end up in the
museum of history that is called “the history of the revolution in
Russia”. Our Bolshevik slogans, the Bolshevik boycott of the Bulygin Duma,
the Bolshevik calls for a mass strike and uprising (as early as the Third
Congress) will be inseparably and forever associated with the October
Revolution in Russia. And we shall use our place in this museum even
during long years or (if it comes to the worst) decades of reaction to teach the
proletariat to hate the treacherous Octobrist-Cadet bourgeoisie, to despise
intellectualist phrases and petty-bourgeois sentimentality. We shall use our
place in this museum under all political conditions, even the worst,
to preach relentless class struggle to the workers, to teach them how to prepare
for a new revolution—one that will be more independent of the
half-hearted and flabby bourgeoisie, and closer to the socialist revolution of
the proletariat.

 

And your place in the museum, worthy Mr. Struve, will be the place assigned to
those who rejoice and make fine speeches when counter-revolution triumphs. You
will always be able to rejoice at such times over the fact that the
revolutionaries have fallen in battle and the stage is occupied by the liberals, who
lay down voluntarily, lay down at the enemy’s feet, so as to “crawl into
infamy”.


If, contrary to our expectations, the revolution is not destined to rise again
and wrest power from the tsar and his gang, you will long remain the hero of the
counter-revolution. We will have a “place in the museum”, but a
good place—that of the October struggle of the people. If,
however, the revolution rises again, as we believe it will, every trace of the
miserable Cadets will disappear within a week, and the struggle of the masses of
the proletariat and the ruined peasantry will once again go forward under
Bolshevik slogans. Under the hegemony of the Cadets, the revolution can only
lie in the dust. It can be victorious only under the hegemony of the Bolshevik
Social-Democrats.


 
Notes
 

[1]

We have just received an extract from the Georgian Social-Democratic
organ of the Tiflis Mensheviks, “Tsin”
(“Forward”), of December 8. The Tiflis Mensheviks
emphatically challenge Plekhanov’s views and declare that his arguments in
favour of the slogan: “a Duma with full power” are erroneous, that the
Social-Democrats cannot take this slogan to mean a constituent
assembly. The slogan of “a Duma with full power”, they write, “would
mean the curtailing of our programme”. Further on they argue that this
slogan is also unacceptable to the Cadets, and that in general a joint
platform for the Social-Democrats and Cadets is quite out of the
question. A joint platform means “clipping the wings of our Party’s
independence, blurring the differences between the views of the
Social-Democrats and those of the bourgeois parties”.  

You are right, Tiflis Menshevik comrades! We note with satisfaction
that in spite of the Central Committee and the majority of Russian
Mensheviks, the Bundists and the Caucasians have not swerved from their
duty to state plainly that Plekhanov’s view and his whole statement are
wrong.  —Lenin

The St. Petersburg organisation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
has held its third (in the past year) general conference.[1]

The first
conference, February 1906, decided the question whether or not to participate in
the elections to the Witte Duma. The second, June 1906, decided the question
whether the demand for a Duma Cabinet should be supported. The third, January
1907, decided the question of the Second Duma election campaign.


The bourgeois parties settle big political questions from case to case by a
simple ruling of one or other party “authority”, which secretly
concocts various political nostrums for the people. Only the workers’
Social-Democratic Party actually practises democracy in organisation, in spite
of the enormous difficulties—and even heavy, sacrifices—which this
entails for an illegal party. Only the workers’ Social-Democratic Party weighs
the importance in principle of every major political step before it
decides to take it. It does not strive for ephemeral success, but subordinates
its practical policy to the ultimate goal—the complete emancipation of
labour from all exploitation. Only the workers’ party, when marching to battle,
demands from all its members a well-considered, straight and clear answer to
the question whether a certain step should be taken and how it should be taken.


The last conference of the St. Petersburg

organisation. too, 

was based on the democratic representation of all the members of the
Party. Moreover, the delegates had to b elected on the basis of a canvass of
opinion of all the electors

    

on the question of agreements with the Cadets. Without an intelligent answer to
      this topical question of tactics, the democratic procedure of electing
      delegates to the conference would have been idle play, unworthy of the
      proletariat.


Here is the resolution adopted by the Conference:



In view of the fact:

(1) that it is absolutely obligatory for the Social-Democratic Party, as the
class party of the proletariat, to conduct its election campaign independently
in all cases where no special and exceptional circumstances are present;

(2) that hitherto the St. Peters burg Social-Democrats, headed by the
St. Petersburg Committee, have been conducting an entirely independent election
campaign, influencing all sections of the working population, both those who
adopt a consistent proletarian standpoint and those who have not fully mastered
it;

(3) that at the present time, two weeks before the elections, it is already
evident that in St. Petersburg the chances of the parties on the right are very
slight, while those of the Cadets are considered (mainly owing to tradition) to
be strong, so that it is particularly imperative for the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party to exert every effort to break the hegemony of
the Cadets in the metropolis, on which the attention of the whole of Russia is
concentrated;

(4) that large sections of the poorer working people in the city who do not yet
adhere to the proletarian standpoint, and whose vote can influence the result of
the elections in the city curia, are vacillating between the desire to vote to
the Left of the Cadets, i.e., to free themselves from the leadership of the
treacherous liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, and the desire to secure at least a
few Trudovik deputies in the Duma by entering into a bloc with the Cadets;

(5) that the wavering Trudovik parties reveal a desire to sanction a bloc with
the Cadets on condition of obtaining one, or at any rate not more than two out
of the six seats in the metropolis, on the grounds that the Social-Democrats
refuse under any circumstances to enter into an agreement with the
non-Social-Democratic sections of the urban poor against the liberal
bourgeoisie—the Conference resolves:

(1) immediately to inform the St. Petersburg Committee of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the Committee of the Trudovik Group that the
St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. is prepared to enter into an
agreement with them on condition that they enter into no agreements whatsoever
with the Cadets;

(2) the terms of the agreement to be complete independence of the contracting
parties as regards slogans, programmes and tactics generally. The six seats in
the Duma to be distributed as follows:

two seats for the workers’ curia, two for the Social-Democrats, one for the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and one for the Trudoviks;

(3) the Conference authorises its executive body to conduct the negotiations;

(4) that in
St. Petersburg Gubernia local agreements with the Socialist-Revolutionaries
and the Trudoviks are permitted on the same principles.

 

Note: In regard to the P.S. Party (the Trudovik or Popular Socialist
    Party) it is resolved: in view of that party’s evasive
    position on the fundamental questions of the struggle outside the Duma, the
    Conference sanctions agreements with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
    Trudoviks provided that they have no agreement with the P.S. Party.



Three main points stand out in examining this resolution:

firstly, categorical renunciation of all agreements with the Cadets; secondly,
inflexible determination of the Social-Democrats to put forward its independent
lists under all circumstances; and, thirdly, sanction of agreements with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks.


To reject agreements with the Cadets was the plain duty of the workers’
party. As soon as the election meetings began in St. Petersburg it at once
became clear to all that the revolutionary Social-Democrats were right when they
said: our liberals have been humbugging ignorant people who have no definite
principles with their cries about the Black-Hundred danger in order to avert the
real danger threatening them from the left. The petty police tricks of the
government, cheating the poor voters out of their votes with the aid of Senate
interpretations have failed to change the mood of the mass of the voters
(whether there will be 100, 120 or 150 thousand voters, makes no
difference). And this mood of the masses is being clearly manifested at
meetings as a mood that is to the left of the Cadets.


Of course, the Black-Hundred danger may not lie in the mass of the electorate
voting Black Hundred, but in the arrest of Left voters and electors by the
Black-Hundred police. There are persistent rumours that the present relative
“freedom” (in Russia if a person is allowed to breathe it is called
freedom!) of election meetings is a trap laid by the government, which intends
to arrest prominent speakers and electors. But it is quite easy to understand
that to combat this Black-Hundred danger we need, not blocs with the
Cadets, but the preparedness of the masses to engage in a struggle that will go
beyond the bounds of so-called parliamentarism.


Secondly, the Conference decided, as was to be expected, that in the metropolis
the Social-Democrats will conduct

    

their campaign independently under any circumstances.
They may offer to enter into an agreement with another party in one form or
another; but we were prepared for complete independence before, and are ready
for it now. Taking the election campaign as a whole, an agreement under such
circumstances will in fact be an exception; the independence of the
Social-Democrats will be the rule.


Thirdly, the Conference offered to enter into an agreement with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks on condition that they kept aloof
from the Cadets and the pro-Cadet Popular Socialists, and on the further
condition that the workers’ curia is given two seats and that the four remaining
seats are divided equally.


This proposal is based on the principle of discriminating between parties
according to their attitude towards the struggle outside the Duma, which
tomorrow may become an immediate question. By making their pacts with other
parties conditional upon the observance of certain principles the
Social-Democrats provide ammunition for mass agitation and propaganda on the
true character of the various parties. The Social-Democrats take into account
the peculiarities of the situation in St. Petersburg, where the mass of the
“Trudovik-inclined” urban petty bourgeoisie are led in tow by the
Cadets. Under such conditions we cannot neglect the task of breaking this
hegemony of the Cadets, of helping the working people to take a step
forward —a small step, it is true, but one of unquestionable
political importance— a step towards a more determined struggle, towards
clearer political ideas, towards more definite class-consciousness.


And this result we shall achieve by our agitation, by our whole
procedure in conducting the election campaign; and we shall achieve it whatever
the answer of the Trudoviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries to our offer may
be. There is no need for us to go into all sorts of calculations to ascertain
the probability of an affirmative or a negative answer. Our attention must not
be concentrated on this. The important thing for us is the fundamental policy
of the proletariat, which remains unchanged in the face of various specific
possibilities: to the deceptive illusions of peaceful struggle and constitutional
toys we counterpose a clear analysis of the

    

tasks of the struggle outside the Duma, a struggle that the course of events is
bringing ever nearer. We say to the petty-bourgeois sections of the urban and
rural working people:

there is only one thing that can prevent the instability and vacillation of the
small proprietors, and that is an independent class party of the revolutionary
proletariat.

The conference of the St. Petersburg organisation of the
R.S.D.L.P., which discussed the question of election tactics during the
elections to the Second State Duma, was held on January 6 (19), 1907. Lenin
delivered a report on electoral agreements during the elections. An account of
his speech was printed in No. 12 of the Bolshevik newspaper Proletary
on January 25 (February 7), 1907.


After the discussion of the report the conference confirmed the resolution
(“A Dissenting Opinion”) of 14 delegates at the November All-Russian
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin gave a detailed analysis of the work of the
St. Petersburg Conference and of the conditions under which it was convened in
the pamphlets:

The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections, “When You Hear the
Judgement of a Fool , (From the Notes of a Social-Democratic Publicist)

The Social-Democrats and the Elections in St. Petersburg

The conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation adopted a
resolution not to enter into a bloc with the Cadets, but to propose an agreement
with the Trudoviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Mensheviks made a
number of protests on formal grounds and, being in a minority, walked out of the
conference.


The liberal newspapers have already made a lot of noise about this event. They
predict a split in the Social-Democratic Party, and hasten to draw a number of
political conclusions. In view of this it is extremely important for every
class-conscious worker to understand what is really taking place in the
Social-Democratic organisation in St. Petersburg and what attitude to adopt
towards this.


We propose, therefore, to examine the main questions that arise in connection
with this event, namely: (1) the composition of the conference; (2) the
immediate reason why the Mensheviks walked out of the conference—the
attempt of the Central Committee to divide the conference into two parts, one
for the city and one for the gubernia; and (3) the significance of the whole
event, especially in view of the election campaign now proceeding in
St. Petersburg.

## The Conditions









Lenin: 1907/duma: The Conditions Under Which the Social-Democratic Conference was Convened, and Its Composition







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections



    

I
The Conditions Under Which the Social-Democratic
Conference was Convened, and
Its Composition

The object of the conference of the St. Petersburg organisation was to adopt a
final decision on the most important political question of the day, namely:
whether or not to

    

enter into agreements with the Cadets at the first stage of the Duma elections.


The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is organised on democratic
lines. This means that all the affairs of the Party are conducted, either
directly, or through representatives, by all the members of the

Party., 

all of
whom without exception have equal rights; moreover, all officials, all leading
bodies, and all institutions of the Party are subject to election, are
responsible to their constituents, and are subject to recall. The affairs of
the St. Petersburg organisation are managed by an elected body, the
St. Petersburg Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The
supreme body of the St. Petersburg organisation, in view of the impossibility of
bringing together all the members of the Party (about 6,000), is the
conference of representatives of the organisation. To this conference
all members of the organisation have a right to send representatives:
one delegate for a definite number of Party members; one delegate for every 50
members, for instance, the ratio that was adopted for the last
conference. These representatives must be elected by all the members of
the Party, and a decision adopted by the representatives is supreme and final
for the whole of the local organisation.


But this is not all. In order that the settlement of a question may be really
democratic, it is not enough to call together the elected representatives of
the organisation. It is necessary that all the members of the
organisation, in electing their representatives, should at the same time
independently, and each for himself, express their opinion on the
point at issue before the whole organisation. Democratically organised parties
and unions cannot, on principle, dispense with such a canvass of the opinion of
every member without exception, in the most important cases at any rate, and
especially when it is a question of a political action in which the
masses act independently, e. g., a strike, elections, the boycott of
some important local institution, etc.


Why is it considered insufficient to send representatives in such cases? Why
must there be a canvass of the opinion of all members of the Party or
what is called a “referendum”? Because the success of mass actions
requires the conscious and voluntary participation of every individual worker.

    

A strike cannot be conducted with the necessary solidarity, voting at elections
will not be conducted intelligently, unless every worker consciously
and voluntarily decides for himself the question: to strike or not to strike?
to vote or not to vote for the Cadets? It is impossible to decide all political
questions by canvassing the opinion of all members of the Party:

this would involve endless, tiresome and fruitless voting. But the most
important questions, and especially those which are directly connected with some
definite action by the masses themselves, must, for the sake of
democracy, be settled, not only by sending representatives, but also by
canvassing the opinion of all members of the Party.


That is why the St. Petersburg Committee resolved that the election of delegates
to the conference should take place only after the members of the Party
had discussed the question of whether to enter into agreements with the Cadets,
only after all members of the Party had voted on that question. An
election is an affair in which the masses take a direct part. Socialists
consider that the political consciousness of the masses is the main
force. Consequently, every member of the Party must express his
considered opinion on the question whether or not to vote for the Cadets at the
elections. Only after this question has been openly discussed by all the Party
members assembled is it possible for each one to adopt an intelligent and firm
decision one way or the other. Only on the basis of such a decision can the
election of representatives to the conference be, not the result of
clannishness, friendship or force of habit (“We will elect our Nikolai
Nikolayevich or Ivan Ivanovich!”), but the result of the considered decision of
the “rank and file” themselves (i.e., of all the
members of the Party) as to their own political

       conduct.[1]

 

The elections to the Duma, i. e., the primary and main voting for delegates or
      electors, will be carried out, not through representatives, but by every
      voter individually. Consequently, if we want to be socialists in deeds and
      not only in words, socialists organised in a really democratic
      workers’ party, then we must see to it that every worker is
    clear on the question of whether to vote for the Cadets or not. To entrust
    representation to Ivan Ivanovich, who is an acquaintance of ours, or to
    Sidor Sidorovich who is a decent fellow, is not enough; the essence
    of the question at issue must be intelligently examined by the
    “rank and file”. Only when that is done will the democratic
    decision be the considered democratic decision of the masses and
    not only the decision of representatives elected because “we know
    them”.


The St. Petersburg Committee is the elected leader of the whole
Social-Democratic organisation in St. Petersburg and St. Petersburg Gubernia. To
lead the membership in a matter like the Duma elections, it was obliged
(if it recognised democracy not in words only) to seek the conscious
participation of the whole membership in the elections. And in order
that the participation of the whole membership in the elections might be
conscious and united, it was necessary that not only representatives of the
Party, but that every member of the Party should give a definite answer to his
St. Petersburg Committee on the question: Does he or does he not stand for
agreements with the Cadets?


Such is the significance of the “debate”, that is, of the
discussion that took place on the controversial question itself before
the election of representatives. At every meeting of Party members, before
proceeding to elect representatives to the conference, there had first to be a
discussion of the controversial political question. The opinion had to
be heard of a representative of the St. Petersburg Committee, i.e., of the
leading local body, and also of those who represented other views. After the
discussion all the Party members voted whether or not they were in
favour of agreements with the Cadets. The votes were counted by a committee of
scrutineers, consisting of representatives of both sides (if there were two
sides on this question in the Party unit). Only by this procedure could the
St. Petersburg Committee ascertain

    

the considered opinion of the whole Party membership, and
consequently, be in a position to lead the masses, not blindly, but on the
basis of their full understanding of the question.


This explanation was necessary because at the conference disputes arose
regarding the “discussion” and the canvass of opinion of all the
members of the Party.


That these disputes were uncalled for is the more obvious to Party members for
the reason that the Central Committee’s own letter of November 10 regarding the
settlement of the question (whether to enter into agreements) by the local
organisations definitely recommends “preliminary discussion”
of the question by all members of the Party.


Let us now consider the composition of the conference itself. At first, all the
representatives elected by the respective organisations were admitted without a
verification of the elections (i.e., without verification of
“credentials”). There were in all 71 representatives, or
delegates, of whom 40 were Bolsheviks and 31 Mensheviks, distributed as follows
(by districts).

Two Estonian delegates (both Bolsheviks) and one Lettish delegate (Menshevik)
were absent. Had they been present, there would have been 42 Bolsheviks and 32
Mensheviks.

 

Hence it is clear that the Bolsheviks were in the majority from the
    outset, before the credentials were verified. Consequently, all talk
    about the Bolsheviks having an “artificial” majority falls to
    the ground. Complaints that the Bolsheviks did not endorse all the
    credentials have now been inserted by the Mensheviks even in the bourgeois
    press. They forgot to inform that press, however, that the Bolsheviks had a
    majority even before the verification of credentials!


To make the question of who had the majority at the conference even clearer and
to settle it once and for all, let us take, not the number of credentials, but
the total number of votes cast by members of the Party.


We shall then get the following figures:





For the Bolsheviks
For the Mensheviks




Unchallenged votes . . .
1,848[2]

787


Challenged votes . . . .
300
946


Total votes
2,148
1,733




Thus, in all, about 4,000 (3,881) Party members voted. The Bolshevik majority
is over 400.


Thus, it is beyond doubt that even if all the challenged votes were
regarded as being in order, the Bolsheviks would still have had a large
majority. Consequently, the disputes over the validity or invalidity of certain
votes had nothing to do with the question of the Bolshevik majority; the
dispute was over the question of how to carry out to the full the principle of
democratic representation.


Why did the Bolsheviks cancel some of the credentials? Because the
challenged credentials could not be recognised as being in order. And
irregular credentials cannot be placed on the same footing with regular and
unchallenged credentials.

 

Which credentials were challenged? Those that were not regularly issued; for
example, those that were not certified by a committee of scrutineers, those
issued without discussion before the voting, or without voting on
“platforms” (i.e., where they failed to ask all the voters
whether or not they were in favour of agreements with the Cadets). Irregular
credentials cannot be regarded as having been democratically issued.


Now the question arises, what was to be done with the challenged credentials? It
was impossible to examine each case separately. This would have entailed sitting
an extra day, and the conference was pressed for time. It was scarcely
able to get through the business by the date on which the workers had
to go to elect the delegates (January 7).


There was only one way out: to raise the “basis of representation”
for all the challenged credentials, i.e., to count them at the rate of
one representative for every 75 votes instead of one for every 50. This method
was adopted for three reasons: (1) it did away with arbitrariness and mutual
irritation in estimating individual challenged credentials; (2) it put the
challenged credentials on both sides on the same footing; (3) it was based on a
decision taken by the St. Petersburg Committee long before the
conference—namely:

the St. Petersburg Committee had decided, in cases where it was quite impossible
to conduct democratic elections to a conference (e.g., where it was impossible
to call meetings owing to police restrictions), to admit representatives who
were elected not quite democratically, but in such cases to raise the
basis of representation, i.e., to allow, not one delegate per 50 members, but
one per 75, per 100, and so on.


Now take the number of challenged and unchallenged votes. If we take the
unchallenged votes, counting one delegate per 50 votes, we get 37 Bolsheviks
and 16 Mensheviks. If we take the challenged votes, counting one delegate per 75
votes, we get 4 Bolsheviks and 12 Mensheviks. The total is 41 Bolsheviks (plus
one from the military organisation, where democratic elections were impossible)
and 28 Mensheviks.


The 70 credentials finally endorsed were distributed by districts as follows:

Hence it is plain that complaints about the composition of the conference are
quite groundless. Of course, if you shout to an uninformed public about the
rejection of the credentials of this person and about the disqualification of
that person, you may for a moment create an impression, if the public does no
consider the matter carefully. But this is mere wrangling, not controversy.


One need only examine all the facts relating to the composition of the
conference to see clearly that there was nothing arbitrary in raising
the basis of representation for all the challenged votes. After all, i
was not by mere chance that 2,635 votes were entirely unchallenged and only
1,246 were challenged! And it cannot be seriously maintained that the
bulk of the challenged votes were challenged at random without any
grounds whatever!


Only think, for instance, what it means to vote “with out a
platform”, as the Mensheviks have done so often (which is the very reason
why nearly 1,000 of their votes were challenged). It means that no
all the members of the Party are asked whether they are in favour of
agreements with the Cadets or against them. The election of delegates takes
place without such a canvass of opinion, or without a platform. It means that
the conference has no means of knowing exactly the opinion of the Party
members! It means that the membership itself is not consulted on a
controversial question (involving the action of the rank and file). Can
irregularities be avoided under such circumstances?

 

Can a sincere advocate of democracy in organisation defend such a
method of voting? Democracy does not mean that the masses must trust their
individual representatives because they know them; it means that the masses
themselves must vote intelligently on the substance of the very important
questions at issue.


Finally, complaints about the composition of the conference must be regarded as
groundless for the additional reason that a number of similar
conferences have been held in St. Petersburg recently. A year ago there was a
conference on the question of the boycott. The Bolsheviks obtained a
majority. In the period of the First Duma there was a conference on the
question of supporting the demand for a Duma (i.e., Cadet) Cabinet. The
Bolsheviks obtained a majority.


Is it not ridiculous to say now that the Bolshevik majority on the question of
electoral agreements with the Cadets could be an accidental one?

 

Notes
 

[1]

Some say that the election of a representative can take place on the
basis of knowing the representative’s views, even without a vote
being taken on the question at issue. But this is true only as regards the
totality of the views held by that representative. It cannot apply
when a special question affecting the action of the masses themselves is
involved. The refusal to vote on a platform (for blocs with the Cadets or
against them) would, under such circumstances, imply that the voter’s views
were vague, that he was irresolute, that he was not quite in agreement with
his representative.—Lenin

[2]

This figure includes 185 votes which the conference decided were quite
in order. If these are not counted, the number of unchallenged votes will
he 1,663.—Lenin

## The Question









Lenin: 1907/duma: The Question of Dividing the Conference







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections



    

II

The Question of Dividing the Conference

The Central Committee of the Party, in which the Mensheviks predominate,
demanded that the St. Petersburg Conference should divide into two: a City
Conference and a Gubernia Conference. The Mensheviks try to justify their
walking out of the conference on the grounds that this demand was not complied
with.


Let us see whether this demand was in keeping with the Party Rules, whether it
was binding on the conference, and whether it was practicable.


The Rules of our Party very definitely establish the democratic organisation of
the Party. The whole organisation is built from below upwards, on an elective
basis. The Party Rules declare that the local organisations are independent
(autonomous) in their local activities. According to the Rules, the Central
Committee co-ordinates and directs all the work of the Party. Hence it is clear
that it has no right to interfere in determining the composition of
local organisations. Since the organisation is built from below upwards,
interference in its composition from above would

    

be a flagrant breach of democracy and of the Party Rules. Let us assume that an
      organisation, for one reason or an other, combines heterogeneous sections,
      for instance, a city and a gubernia. Under a democratic system, this
      combination cannot be maintained (or prescribed) by orders from
      above. Consequently, it can be broken up only if this is desired from
      below: the city can separate from the gubernia, and no one can forbid it
      to do so. The gubernia can separate from the city, and no one can forbid
      it to do so. If no at all large, or at all distinct, part of an
      organisation has expressed a desire to separate, it means that the Central
      Committee has been unable to convince a single
    influential part of the organisation that separation is necessary! That
    being the case, to force a division from above is a mockery of democracy, a
    mockery of the Party Rules. It signifies nothing more nor less than an
    attempt on the part of the Central Committee to abuse its powers, i.e., to
    use them, not in the interests of Party unity, but in the interests of one
    section of the Party (the Mensheviks)—to use its powers to distort the
    will and the decisions of the local workers.


The Central Committee was so conscious of the fact that its demand was
unwarranted that in its written general order it expressed itself very
guardedly. In it the Central Committee recommends all Party
organisations “as far as possible” (this is the literal
expression!) to adapt their boundaries to accord with the boundaries of the
electoral districts. There can be no question of such advice being binding;
and nobody claimed that it was. That the Central Committee had some
special object in view in regard to St. Petersburg is evident from the fact that it
made no such demand for a division of the conference in any other city in
Russia. For instance, in Wilno, the city conference embraces
Social-Democrats representing enterprises situated outside the city
boundaries, i.e., in another electoral
district. The Central Committee did not even think of raising the question of
dividing the Wilno Conference!


In Odessa also there was a joint conference, although there, too, some of the
factories that were represented are situated outside the city police area. In
fact, can one mention a single large city where the organisation corresponds to
the police division into city and part of the gubernia?

    

Can anyone seriously claim that in the big cities, in the centres of the
Social-Democratic workers’ movement, the suburbs where the biggest
factories are sometimes situated, the most proletarian
“suburbs” should be separated? This is such a gross mockery of
common sense that only those who are most unscrupulously seeking a pretext for a
split could seize upon it.


We have only to look at the districts of St. Petersburg to see that the demand
to divide the conference was impracticable. To divide an organisation in
general, or a conference in particular, into two parts, one for the city and one
for the gubernia, it is necessary either to know the address of every member of
the Party, or have ready-made Party units, branches and districts organised on a
territorial basis, i.e., districts formed according to the place of
residence of Party members, or the situation of factories in the various
police districts.


But we see that in St. Petersburg (as probably in most cities in Russia) the
districts, sub-districts and lower Party units are organised, not only on a
territorial (local) basis but also on an occupational basis (according
to the trade and occupation of the workers, and of the population in general)
and on a national basis (different nationalities, different languages).


For instance, in St. Petersburg there is a railway district. This
district is organised on an occupational basis. How could it be divided into a
city section and a gubernia section? According to the place of residence of
every individual railwayman: St. Petersburg, Kolpino, and other stations? Or
according to the location of the railway trains, which, unfortunately for our
Central Committee, have a habit of moving from place to place, from the
“city” of St. Petersburg into the “gubernia”, and even
into other gubernias?


Try to divide the Lettish district! And then there is the Estonian
district and the military organisation.


Even the territorial districts cannot be divided. The workers at the conference
said so themselves. A worker from Moscow District got up and said: I know
factories in our district which are not far from the city boundaries. At the end
of the day’s work you can see at a glance that part of the workers make for the
“city” and others for the “gubernia”.

    

How are we going to divide them? And the workers simply laughed at
      the Central Committee’s proposal.


Only very

naive 

people can fail to see the underlying purpose of the whole
business. Only very naive people can say:

still, we ought to have tried to divide, “approximately”,
“as far as possible”.


If it were done approximately, it would, to some extent, have been an
arbitrary division, for it would have been impossible to
divide the Lettish, railway and other districts exactly. But every arbitrary
decision would have evoked new, interminable protests and complaints; it would
have called forth new orders from the Central Committee, and would have provided
any number of new pretexts for splits. Look at the list of districts (given
above) and you will see that some people might have declared that only four
districts are purely and indubitably city districts: the Vasilyev sky Ostrov, City,
Vyborg and Petersburg districts. Why only these? Because there the
Mensheviks would have had a majority. On what grounds could such an
arbitrary decision be justified?


And how could the Central Committee justify its arbitrary conduct in not even
thinking of dividing Wilno, yet demanding that St. Petersburg should be
divided? If you pro test against arbitrary action, who will finally settle your
dispute? Why, this very same Central Committee....


Even the most naïve people will now understand that the complaints about the
composition of the conference and about its refusal to divide are simply a
blind. The sum and substance of the matter is that the Mensheviks decided not
to submit to the majority of the St. Petersburg organisation, and to bring about
a split on the eve of the elections in order to desert the socialist workers for
the Cadets.

## What Is the Significance









Lenin: 1907/duma: What is the Significance of the Menshevik Walk-Out at the Conference?







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections



    

III
What is the Significance of the Menshevik Walk-Out
at the Conference?

Some readers may think that the conclusion we have drawn is too drastic. We,
however, think that it is unworthy of a socialist to conceal or blur the truth
concerning a serious

    

political matter. We must call a spade a spade. We must expose all subterfuges
and pretences, so that the mass of the workers may clearly understand what is
going on. Only bourgeois parties regard elections as a game played behind the
scenes and a division of the spoils. A workers’ party, however, must first of
all help the people clearly to understand the relations between the parties, to
understand their own interests and the objects of the struggle, to understand
what is going on behind the scenes.


We have seen that the complaints about the composition of the conference of the
St. Petersburg organisation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, about
its refusal to divide, were mere evasions. We know that the real issue is a
simple one. The Mensheviks wanted an agreement with the Cadets at all costs. The
Mensheviks knew that the majority of the members of the St. Petersburg
organisation did not share that view. At the All-Russian Conference the
Mensheviks decided to abide by the decision of the local organisation in each
locality. Now they have broken their promise and are trying to achieve
their objects by means of a split.


Today (January 13) the 31 Mensheviks who walked out of the conference have
already declared in the St. Petersburg newspapers that they have made proposals
for a bloc to the Cadets and to all the Trudovik parties; not only to the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks (with whom the conference offered to
make an agreement), but also to the “Popular Socialists”.


So the matter is perfectly clear. The class-conscious proletariat has decided
to conduct an independent election campaign. The petty bourgeoisie (including
the Trudoviks) is vacillating, rushing from one side to another; it is quite
capable of preferring a deal with the Cadets to a struggle based on
principles. The Mensheviks are the petty-bourgeois section of the workers’
party. At the very last moment, on the flimsiest pretexts, they are abandoning
the revolutionary proletariat and going over to the Cadets.


That this conclusion is right is best confirmed by the Cadet newspapers. No one
will suspect the Cadets of being in sympathy with the views of the
St. Petersburg, i.e., the Bolshevik Social-Democrats!

 

Look at Rech, the central organ of the Cadet Party. Everybody knows
    perfectly well that Rech, in unison with Tovarishch, has
    been constantly egging the Mensheviks on to a split, and seeking every
    opportunity to praise them, care fully distinguishing them from the
    Bolsheviks. As soon as it became known that the Mensheviks had walked out of
    the Social-Democratic conference, Rech (January 11) published an
    editorial entitled: “The Social-Democratic Conference and
    Agreements”. This article openly applauds the
    “determination” of the Mensheviks and welcomes the
      split which they have initiated. This article openly declares that
    “outside the bloc of the revolutionary parties in the narrow sense
      of the word” (i.e., the St. Petersburg Social-Democrats and
    those to whom they have made proposals for an agreement, the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group) there
    remain the Mensheviks and the Popular Socialists (the most moderate
    and semi-Cadet of all the petty-bourgeois Trudovik parties).


And the Cadets say outright that they are prepared to
“resume” negotiations with “both these moderate
socialist parties”. They say outright that “the differentiation
[division] which has taken place among the socialist parties promises to bring
the ideas of the moderate socialists on Duma tactics somewhat closer to our own
[i.e., Cadet] ideas on this subject”.


Coming from the leading Cadet newspaper, this statement is extremely
important. The Cadets not only appreciate the practical results of the Menshevik
change of front. They see clearly that the split engineered by the Mensheviks is
of fundamental significance, i.e., that this split in fact will change the
attitude of the Mensheviks towards the fundamental concepts of the political
struggle and the tasks of the working class. The Cadets understand perfectly
well that the Mensheviks have veered, not only towards accepting agreements in
practice, but also towards the fundamental views of the bourgeoisie; that they
have departed from the proletarian policy and have approached the bourgeois
policy. Rech plainly states that the moderate socialists (that
is to say, the Mensheviks) are approaching the Cadet tactics, are actually
recognising Cadet priority and leadership. Al though they do not yet know
whether the Socialist-Revolutionaries

    

and the Trudoviks will accept the proposal of the Social-Democratic
conference, the Cadets are already reckoning with a very definite
alignment of political forces: the liberal bourgeoisie will lead the moderate
petty bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeois section of the proletariat; the
revolutionary proletariat will act independently, and draw with it, at best
(best for us, worst for the Cadets) only a part of the petty bourgeoisie.


This is how the Cadets depict the situation. And it cannot be denied that in
this respect the Cadets are quite right. As the sun is reflected in a drop of
water, so the small episode in St. Petersburg reflects the constant
relationship between the policies of the liberal bourgeoisie, the working class
and the petty bourgeoisie that inevitably characterises all capitalist
countries. Everywhere and at all times the liberal bourgeoisie tries to bribe
the uneducated masses with sops in order to divert them from revolutionary
Social- Democracy. The Cadets are beginning to apply in Russia the
“English” bourgeois method of fighting the proletariat, i. e., not
by violence, but by bribing, flattering, dividing and cajoling the
“moderates”, by making them Cabinet Ministers, Members of
Parliament, electors, etc.


The meaning of the phrase in the Cadet Rech about
“resumption” of negotiations is also clear enough. When the
Social-Democrats
were united and the revolutionary Social-Democrats were predominant among them,
the negotiations were broken off. Now that “both the moderate socialist
par ties” have broken away from the revolution, the Cadets declare:
“negotiations may be resumed”.


If the reader is not quite clear as to what these words mean in practice, we
will explain them to him. The Cadets offered two seats (out of six) to the
Lefts, namely: one seat to the workers’ curia and one to the socialists
generally. The negotiations were broken off. Now the Cadets are inviting the
“moderate socialists” again:

“Come back, Mr. Customer,
perhaps we can come to terms. We will give one seat to the Mensheviks and
another to the ’Popular Socialists’, or, in a fit of generosity, we will even
give you three seats.”


That is what the Cadets mean by “resumption” of negotiations: we
made no concessions to the Lefts; but we are willing to make
concessions to the moderate Lefts!

 

    Persons who are naive or politically inexperienced may shake their heads,
    express doubt, sympathise, etc., as much as they like; it will not alter
    matters. After all, it is not how a certain result was obtained
    that is important, it is the result itself that is important (i.e., for the
    Cadets it is not important, but for the masses of the workers who wish to
    adopt an intelligent attitude towards politics, it is very
    important).


We do not know exactly how the negotiations between the Mensheviks and the
Cadets were conducted—whether in writing, or by word of mouth, or by mere
hints. It is possible that prominent moderate Mensheviks simply hinted
to the Cadet leaders that a split was likely among the Social-Democrats, hinted
that they would agree to agreements on a district basis. And the
Cadets, of course, were quick to take the hint: “they” will split
the St. Petersburg Social-Democrats, and we will include “them” in
the district election list! “They” will help us, and we will help
“them”. Is this deal less effective, business-like and definite than
if “they” had gone straight to Kutler, Milyukov or Nabokov and said
in plain words: We will split the St. Petersburg Conference of the
Social-Democratic Party for you, and you will help us to get elected on some
district list?


It is a fact that this is precisely the policy that is pursued by the
bourgeois liberals and the opportunist Social-Democrats in all
constitutional countries. The Russian workers must learn to understand
this policy if they do not want to be led by the nose. Chernyshevsky said in his
day: “Those who are afraid of soiling their hands had better keep away
from politics.”[1]

Those who take part in the elections and
are afraid of soiling their hands in turning up the muck of bourgeois politics
had better get out. Kid-gloved simpletons only do harm in politics by their
fear of facing facts.


Another statement in the bourgeois press that fully con firms our
estimate of the split is that made by Madame Kuskova in Tovarishch
(January 10). She, too, welcomes the Mensheviks, incites them to bring about an
irrevocable split, advises them not to “compromise” with the
Bolsheviks, and promises them the assistance of the Rabocheye Dyelo
group.

 

To understand Madame Kuskova’s article, one must know who she is. We will say who
she is, as the majority of the workers do not know her.


The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was founded in 1898. In 1899 Madame
Kuskova and M. Prokopovich were members of the Party, to be exact, members of
the section abroad, which was led by Plekhanov, at that time a
revolutionary Social-Democrat. Madame Kuskova, however, was then, as now, an
opportunist; she advocated petty-bourgeois views in the Social-Democratic
movement and championed Bernsteinism, which, in the final analysis, means
subordinating the working class to the policy of the liberals. Madame Kuskova
expressed her views most clearly in the celebrated Credo (which means a
symbol of faith, a programme, an ex position of world-outlook). This
Credo said the following:

“The workers must conduct the economic
struggle, and the liberals the political struggle.” The Rabocheye
Dyelo people (as the opportunists in the Social-Democratic movement were
then called) were substantially inclined to take the same view. Plekhanov
declared a war to the knife against these views (in which he was assisted by the
Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats), and on this issue split the
section of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party abroad. He wrote a
pamphlet entitled Vademecum (a Guide for the Rabocheye
Dyelo people), in opposition to the opportunists, especially Madame
Kuskova.


Madame Kuskova was expelled from the Social-Democratic Party. With Prokopovich,
she went over to the liberals, the Cadets. Later on she left the Cadets as well,
and became a “non—party” writer for the

“non—party” 

Cadet newspaper Tovarishch.


Madame Kuskova is not an isolated case. She is a typical specimen of
the petty-bourgeois intellectual, who imports opportunism into the workers’
party and wanders from the Social-Democrats to the Cadets, from the Cadets to
the Mensheviks, and so forth.


These are the people who are beating the drum and cheering in honour of the
split that the Mensheviks are causing among the Social-Democrats in
St. Petersburg.


These are the people to whom the workers who follow the Mensheviks are handing
over the cause of the proletariat.

The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections



    

IV
The Political Parties and the Forthcoming
Elections in St. Petersburg

How do matters stand now with the elections in St. Petersburg?


It is clear now that there will be three main lists at the elections: the
Black-Hundred list, the Cadet list, and the Social-Democratic list.


The first will be supported by the Octobrists; the second, probably, by the
Mensheviks and the Popular Socialists; the third, perhaps, by the Trudoviks and
the Socialist-Revolutionaries, although it is quite possible that these
vacillating parties, which have not given a definite answer, so far, will also follow
the Cadets (partly owing to the split among the Social-Democrats).


Is there a Black-Hundred danger in St. Petersburg, i.e., a danger of the Black
Hundreds winning the elections? The Mensheviks, who are now going over from the
socialists to the Cadets, say that there is.


They are telling a downright lie.


Even in the Cadet Rech, that cautious, diplomatic

news paper, 

which protects the interests of the liberals in every detail, even in
Rech we read in an article by Mr. Vergezhsky that at the election
meetings the Octobrists are entirely in the background and that the voters are
wavering between the Cadets and the socialists.


All the information we get about the election meetings and about the impression
created by the Lidval case,[2]

the trial of the murderers of Herzenstein,[3]

the exposures of Black-Hundred outrages, etc.,
clearly shows that the Right parties enjoy no respect among the voters.


Those who still talk about a Black-Hundred danger in the elections are deceiving
themselves and deceiving the masses of the workers. It is now obvious that the
cry about the Black-Hundred danger is a Cadet attempt to gain the support of the
ignorant masses.


The Black-Hundred danger does not lie in a Black-Hundred vote, but in the
possibility that the government will resort to violence, in the possible arrest
of electors, etc. The remedy for this danger is not agreements with the
Cadets,

    

but the development of the revolutionary consciousness and the
revolutionary determination of the masses. And it is the Cadets who more than
anyone else are hindering the development of this consciousness and this
determination.


The really important fight in St. Petersburg is that between the Cadets and the
Social-Democrats. The Trudovik parties have proved their weakness by following
the most moderate and semi-Cadet “Popular Socialist Party”, and also
by the fact that they are not displaying any independence or firmness at all.


If the Mensheviks had not betrayed the socialists on the eve of the elections,
there is no doubt that the Trudoviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries would
have accepted our terms. There is no doubt that the balk of
the voters, who in St. Petersburg, as everywhere, are poor people, would have
followed the socialists and the Trudoviks, not the Cadets. The elections in
St. Petersburg would then have had the significance of a major battle, which
would clearly and definitely have put before the whole of Russia the
fundamental questions of the future of the Russian

     revolution.[1]


The treachery of the Mensheviks makes our election campaign more difficult, but
this increases the importance in principle of an independent
Social-Democratic campaign. The proletariat does not have, and cannot have,
any other means of combating the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie than that
of developing the class-consciousness and solidarity of the masses, of training
them through experience of political development.


While the Trudoviks are wavering and the Mensheviks are haggling, we must throw
all our energies into independent

    

      agitation. Let everyone know that the Social-Democrats are putting forward
      their own list without fail, under all circumstances. And let all the poor
      sections of voters know that the choice before them is between the Cadets
      and the socialists.


The voters must ponder over this choice. At all events, this reflection will
help very much to develop the political consciousness of the masses,
which is of far greater importance than obtaining a seat for X or Y from the
Cadets. If the masses of the urban poor are taken in once more by the promises
of the Cadets, if they are carried away once more by the clamour of liberal
phrase-mongering and liberal promises of “peaceful” progress and
“peaceful” legislation by Gurko, and Kutler and
Milyukov—events will soon shatter their last illusions.


The revolutionary Social-Democrats must tell the masses the whole truth and
unswervingly pursue their own path. All those who cherish the real gains
achieved in the Russian revolution by proletarian struggle, all who possess the
instinct of those who work and are exploited, will follow the party of the
proletariat. And the correctness of this party’s views will become clearer and
clearer to the masses with every new stage in the development of the Russian
revolution.


    

     
Notes
 

[1]

An interesting event in this connection was the meeting of voters held
in Kolomna the other day. The “Trudovik” Vodovozov (who, apparently,
became a Trudovik only for the purpose of harnessing the Trudoviks to the
Cadets) proposed and secured the adoption of a resolution in favour of
giving the Cadets two seats out of six in a general bloc of Left
parties. What simplicity! Before one can offer the smaller share of seats,
one must win first, Mr. Vodovozov, and not trail behind the
Cadets! But even such a meeting, with such a “chorus
leader”, showed by the way it voted that the masses are inclined more to
the Left than the Cadets. We are obliged to put before these masses the
alternative: either for the liberal bourgeoisie, or for the revolutionary
proletariat.—Lenin

Lidval case—the case of B. Lidval, big
businessman and speculator, and V. I. Gurko—Deputy Minister of the
    Interior. With Gurko’s assistance Lidval made a deal with the government to
    supply during October-December 1900, 10,000,000 poods of rye to the
    famine-stricken provinces of Russia. Lidval received a large sum of
    government funds from Gurko as advance payment but by mid-December 1906 had
    brought up to the railways less than one-tenth of the total amount of
    grain. The discovery of the embezzlement of government funds and
    speculation on the famine became common knowledge and the government was
    forced to bring the matter to the courts. But the case never came to trial
    and the only result for Gurko was that he was removed from his
    post. Lidval case helped to expose the anti-popular policy of the
    tsarist government, and to bring about the failure of the Right-wing
    parties in the elections to the Second State Duma.





[3]

Lenin is referring to the tsarist government’s farcical
trial of the murderers of M. Y. Herzenstein, a Cadet member of the First State
Duma (killed by Black-Hundred agents in Finland on July 18 (31), 1906). In spite
of the fact that wide circles of the public knew who were responsible for the
murder, the tsarist government did every thing to prevent the murderers from
being convicted. The investigation was deliberately dragged out, the trial was
several times postponed and finally, on April 3 (16), 1907, the case was
dropped.

The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections



    

Postscript

The leading article in Rech of January 14 further confirms what we
have said above concerning the significance of the Menshevik desertion from the
socialists to the side of the bourgeoisie. Rech is jubilant at the
fulfilment of its prediction, at the fact that the Mensheviks are breaking away
in St. Petersburg and setting up their own organisation. “That is exactly
what happened,” says the newspaper, referring to what it had said in previous
issues. “A section of the Social-Democratic Party, not the most
influential, but the one that is most inclined to parliamentary activity, has
fallen in with our proposals.”


Yes, it is true. The Mensheviks have fallen in with the desire of the
liberal bourgeoisie to split off the opportunist section of the workers’ party
and to subordinate it to the leadership of the Cadets. We have seen above that
Rech has already separated the Mensheviks and the Popular Socialists
from the revolutionary parties, calling them “moderate
socialists”. Now Rech has gone a step further. It says that the
Popular Socialists, too, will probably prefer a bloc with the Cadets. It states:
“The Mensheviks have definitely fallen in with the proposal to form a
general opposition bloc.” “It must be admitted that the
possibility of an opposition bloc of the Cadets, Mensheviks and Popular
Socialists has become considerably greater since the Bolsheviks rejected the
proposal.”


Thus, the Cadets themselves have now admitted that there are three blocs, or at
any rate three main political forces, in the elections: the government bloc, the
opposition bloc and the revolutionary bloc. This division is quite correct. We
note that force of circumstances is compelling the

    

Cadets to recognise what we have long and persistently pointed out. We also note
      that so tar the only ones in the revolutionary “bloc”
    who are resolute and determined are the revolutionary Social-Democrats. The
    other elements, and in particular the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie (the
    “Socialist-Revolutionaries”), are still wavering.


The significance in principle of the Menshevik desertion to the Cadets is
becoming more and more apparent. The fine words of the Menshevik election
platforms and of the statements of principle in their resolutions (for
instance, at the All-Russian Social-Democratic Conference), the declarations
that they would shatter the illusions about the peaceful method, that they were
advising the voters to send fighters to the Duma and not petitioners, and so on
and so forth—all these words have turned out to be mere words.
Actually, the Mensheviks have allowed themselves to be dragged along by the
Cadets, by Cadet policy. Actually, the Mensheviks have found
themselves in the “opposition bloc”, in other words, they have
become a mere appendage of the Cadets.


More than that, the leading article in Rech of January 14 reveals also
the price the Cadets intend to pay the Mensheviks for supporting them
and joining the opposition bloc. This price is one seat in the Duma, to be
taken from the workers’ curia. Listen:


“Since this [i.e., the formation of an opposition bloc of the Cadets,
Mensheviks and Popular Socialists] has reduced the number of claimants for the
Duma seats, it may be possible, by a new arrangement, to accept the proposal of
the party of people’s freedom and content ourselves with two seats out of the
six. Now, of course, it will in all probability be necessary to amend this
proposal somewhat.

After the decision of the conference, the seat that was
intended for the person elected by the workers’ curia can obviously no longer
be given to a Bolshevik worker. In view of the new composition of the bloc
the Mensheviks might legitimately regard that seat as theirs. The other
seat out of the two ceded by the party of people’s freedom would in that case go
to the Popular-Socialist bloc.”


A fine stroke of business! We can congratulate the Cadets on their bargain! For
the same two “ceded” seats they acquire all the petty-bourgeois
parties, as well as the petty-bourgeois

    

section of the workers’ party—and that at the expense of the
workers!


The workers are to lose their right to a representative from the workers’ curia
because the Mensheviks have deserted the Social-Democrats and have
become a moderate socialist party (in the estimation of Rech), have
joined the opposition bloc. The workers of St. Petersburg are to lose the right
allowed them by the Cadets of disposing of their seat as they please
because the Mensheviks instead of following the revolutionary
Social-Democrats, have followed the Cadets. For their “little deal”
with the Cadets the Mensheviks receive a “small concession”, not at
the expense of the Cadets, but at the expense of the workers.... What a
magnificent specimen of bourgeois concessions to “the people”! The
bourgeoisie is prepared to give seats to the champions of “the
people”, providing these champions go over to the bourgeoisie....


The delegates and electors in the workers’ curia will undoubtedly see now what
advantages, in practice as well as in principle, they will derive from
an agreement with the Cadets. It is clear, is it not, that the Cadets have
offered (not given, but offered) one seat to the workers’ curia out of sincere
sympathy with real freedom really for the people, and not because they want to
entice the ignorant, needy masses to the side of the bourgeoisie?

St. Petersburg, January 15, 1907

The bourgeois press is now gossiping and cackling over the resolutions of the
St. Petersburg Social-Democratic Conference. The liberals, from the pompous
official organ Rech to the gutter rag Segodnya, are united in
a general chorus of jubilation over the split caused by the Mensheviks, of
triumph at the return of these prodigal sons of “society” to the
fold of the “opposition bloc”, at their emancipation from
“revolutionary illusions”.


Social-Democrats who are really on the side of the revolutionary proletariat
would do well to ask: “But who are the judges?”


Let us take what is perhaps the best of these judges, Rodnaya Zemlya,
of January 15. The trend of this newspaper is undoubtedly more Left than that of
the Cadets. Judging from all the facts, it may be called a Trudovik trend. As
documentary confirmation of this political estimate we may point out that
Mr. Tan[3]

is a contributor to that newspaper. Mr. Tan’s name is
in the published list of members of the organising committee of the
“Trudovik (Popular Socialist) Party”.


And so, the judges are the Trudoviks.


They condemn the Bolsheviks, and, like the Cadets, approve the plan of the
Mensheviks. They disagree with the Cadets only in that they object to the latter
getting more than two or three seats in the general bloc of all the Left
parties.

 

Such is the verdict. Let us examine the grounds.




“The controversy undoubtedly centres on the question whether
there is or is not a Black-Hundred danger in St. Petersburg.”




That is not true. If you take it upon yourselves to judge the
Bolshevik Social-Democrats in a leading article of a political newspaper, it is
your duty to know what you are judging. In that leading article you
yourselves say: “The controversy that has now flared up over the resolutions
of the [Social-Democratic] conference is undoubtedly one of public
interest.” People who express the wish publicly to participate in a controversy
of general interest and at once betray their ignorance of the
“centre” of the controversy run the risk of having a none too
flattering appellation hurled at them....


The revolutionary Social-Democrats have repeatedly explained and insisted in
all their numerous political declarations that the so-called Black-Hundred
danger cannot be regarded as the “centre” of the
controversy over election tactics.


Why not? Because the tactics of the workers’ party during the elections must be
only the application to a particular case of the general
principles of the socialist tactics of the proletariat. Elections are only
one of the fields, and by no means the most important, most essential one
(particularly in a revolutionary period), in which the socialist proletariat
wages the struggle for liberty and for the abolition of all exploitation. In
addition to the one waged with the aid of ballot papers, there is another type
of struggle, which inevitably flares up in times of revolution. This
other struggle is apt to be forgotten by intellectuals who imagine that they
are men of education, whose sympathies for liberty lie no deeper than the tips
of their tongues. And it is apt to be forgotten by the small proprietors, who
stand aloof from the bitter, everyday struggle against capital and its
henchmen. But the proletarian does not forget about it.


Therefore, for the class-conscious proletarian, election tactics can only be an
adaptation of his general tactics to a particular struggle, namely, the election
struggle; under no circumstances does this imply a change in the principles of
his tactics, or the shifting of the “centre” of these tactics.
 

The basis of socialist tactics in time of revolution consists in the progressive
      class, the proletariat, marching at the head of the people’s revolution
      (the revolution that is now taking place in Russia is a bourgeois
      revolution in the sense that the attainment of complete freedom and all
      the land for the people will not rid us in the least of the rule of the
      bourgeoisie; obviously, the fact that the revolution has this
      socio-economic character does not prevent it from being a people’s
      revolution). The progressive class must therefore consistently expose to
      the masses the falsity of all hopes of negotiations and agreements with
      the old regime in general, and of agreements between landlords and
      peasants over the land question in particular. The progressive class must
      pursue its independent line of undeviating struggle, supporting only those
      who are really fighting, and only to the ex tent that they fight.


Such are the basic principles of socialist tactics, which dictate to the
workers’ party class independence as the rule, and collaboration and agreements
only with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, and only as an exception.


The liberals do not understand these principles of Social-Democratic
tactics. The idea of class struggle is foreign to them; the idea of contrasting
a people’s revolution to deals and negotiations is repugnant to them. But in
principle all Social-Democrats, Bolsheviks and even Mensheviks, accept
these tactics. The Trudoviks, who undertake to edit a political organ without
knowing the ABC of the contemporary tactical problems of socialism, can read
about this even in the election platform of the Social-Democratic
Party—the platform of the Mensheviks, who predominate in the Central
Committee.


“Citizens,” states this platform, “you should elect to the Duma
people who not only want liberty for Russia, but are anxious to help the
people’s revolution to achieve it.... The majority in the First Duma, led by the
party of ’people’s freedom’, hoped to obtain liberty and land by means of
peaceful negotiations with the government   Citizens! Elect fighters for the
revolution, who, shoulder to shoulder with you, will continue the great cause
that was initiated in January, October and December last year
(1905).”

 

The “centre of the controversy”, which our Trudoviks have totally
failed to grasp, is whether agreements with the Cadets can be sanctioned in
principle from this point of view. The St. Petersburg Social-Democratic
Conference answered this question in the negative, as the 14 delegates of the
All-Russian Conference (of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) had done
before them. No agreements can be tolerated with a party which is bargaining and
parley lug with the old regime. The Cadets cannot be our allies in the
“people’s revolution”. Their admission to the ranks of the
“fighters for the revolution” would not strengthen but weaken these
fighters, whose work is being hindered by the Cadets, who are now openly
opposing the struggle and all revolutionary slogans.


In failing to see the principle underlying the attitude of the
Bolshevik Social-Democrats towards the Cadets, our judges have failed to notice
the “elephant”.


These Trudoviks are entirely under the ideological influence of the bourgeois
liberals. The elections have over shadowed everything for them; election results
have over shadowed the task of enlightening the masses in the course of
the election campaign. They have no idea how important it is for a
Social-Democrat to carry on perfectly clear, definite and unambiguous election
agitation if he is to remain true to his principles, loyal to his revolutionary
stand point in spite of all efforts to tempt him with the prospect of a seat in
the Duma, or to frighten him with the prospect of not winning a single seat in
the capital. Absorbed in the liberals’ scrapping, the Trudoviks have forgotten
all principles, they have forgotten all the fundamental objects of the
revolution. They see nothing, understand nothing, care for nothing, and only
keep on muttering: “one seat, two seats, three seats”!




...“The controversy ... centres on ... whether there is a Black Hundred
danger in St. Petersburg.”...




So you reduce the Black-Hundred danger to the danger of a Black-Hundred victory
in elections faked by the government! Cannot you understand, gentlemen, that
by putting the question in this way, you are admitting that the
government is already victorious, and that the cause of liberty,

    

which you prate about so much, is already lost? You yourselves do not see, and
    you are preventing the masses of the people from seeing, the real
    Black-Hundred danger, which is manifested not in the voting, but in the
    definition of the conditions of voting (the Senate interpretations and the
    impending repeal of the electoral law of December 11), in the nullification
    of the results of voting (the dissolution of the Duma). You are entirely
    adopting the vulgar liberal point of view and are concentrating your
    minds—and the minds of the mass of the people whom you are
    misleading—on a struggle within the limits of a fake law which is
    being still further faked. You fail to see the Black-Hundred danger in the
    form of the possible arrest of all the electors. You throw away that which
    depends on you, and wholly on you, which is at any rate a lasting and
    substantial asset to the revolution, namely: the development of the
    revolutionary spirit of the masses by consistent agitation. On the other
    hand, what you are chasing after depends not on you, but on the artifices of
    Stolypin, on a new Senate interpretation, on further violations of the
    electoral law by the police. Consequently, you are fighting the
    “Black-Hundred danger” in exactly the same way as the French
    bourgeois republicans are fighting the monarchist danger; namely, by
    strengthening monarchist institutions and the monarchist constitution
    within the republic. For, by instilling into the minds of the people the
    idea that the Black-Hundred danger is the danger of an increased
    Black-Hundred vote, you are perpetuating the ignorance of the most backward
    masses as to the real source and real nature of the Black-Hundred danger.


But let us proceed. Let us assume that there will be no further Senate
interpretations concerning the elections and the electors. Let us take the
question of the parties that may win the elections in St. Petersburg under the
existing electoral system.


The Trudoviks cannot deny that the parties of the Right have been seriously
compromised; that the Union of October Seventeenth is suffering defeat after
defeat, each more ignominious than the last; that “of late the Octobrists
have completely subsided, stunned by heavy blows from the Left”; that
“the public has swung to the Left”.

 

But ... Shchedrin long ago translated this “but” of the Russian
liberals into intelligible language: “ears will never grow higher than
foreheads, never!”—but “technical difficulties”,
“literature is not being delivered”, “they won’t give us
ballot papers”, “police restrictions”....


There you have the psychology of the Russian intellectual: in words he is a
bold radical, in deeds he is a contemptible little government official.


The remedy for police restrictions is supposed to lie in blocs with the Cadets!
Why not blocs with the Octobrists, who “want” a
constitution, and are sure of not being subject ed to “restrictions”?
Truly Russian political logic: electoral agreements to combat the failure of the
post-office to deliver literature, to combat the refusal to issue ballot
papers.... What are you combating, gentlemen?


The “laws” which sanction the outrageous conduct of the police,
which declare certain parties to be “illegal” and deprive them of
ballot papers. How are you combating them?


Why, of course, by means of an agreement with a party which will either obtain
ballot papers from the Peaceful Renovators, or come to terms with Stolypin
before the Duma opens, or else will also be left without ballot papers!


The Russian government official (a radical at twenty, a liberal at thirty, and
simply an official at forty) is accustomed to play the liberal when at home and
make threatening gestures where nobody can see him. He thinks the election
campaign should be fought along these same lines. Influence the masses?
Nonsense, the post-office refuses to deliver our literature.


Publish and distribute literature without the “post-office” and
similar institutions?


Nonsense! These are obsolete, revolutionary illusions, which are not in accord
with “broad” constitutional activity. Broad constitutional activity
consists in acting so as to fool the authorities; “they” will look
for me among the Social-Democrats, or among the Socialist-Revolutionaries, but
I shall hide in the Cadet list so well that they will not find me. The
government will look for me as a revolutionary, but I shall fool both the
government and the revolutionaries; I shall go over to the “opposition
bloc”. You see what a clever fellow I am!

 

But will it not turn out, Oh worthy politician, that you will be fooling also
      the masses, who will no longer be able to distinguish you from the
      “opposition” of the obsequious liberals?


Nonsense! What do the masses matter?... Well, we’ll give the workers’ curia a
seat.... And then, from a certain point of view, we are all in favour of freedom
... the revolution has become a national cause ... the Cadets, too, are ready
to fight in their own way....


The question arises, have our Trudoviks any political ideas, besides ideas
relating to the police? They have. Their idea is that we must adapt
ourselves not to the energetic and active voter, but to the stay-at-home, the
cowed or sleepy voter. Listen to the arguments of a “Left”
newspaper:




“The temper that prevails at meetings is no criterion of the temper of the
whole mass of voters.... Not more than one-tenth of the voters go to meetings;
of course, these are the most energetic, lively and active people.”



Truly a sufficient reason for trailing in the wake of the least energetic, the
most lifeless and inactive Cadet voters! The tragedy of the Russian radical is
that for decades he has been yearning for meetings, for liberty, burning with
passion (in words) for liberty; and when he goes to a meeting and finds that
its temper is more radical than his own, he begins to sigh: “it is hard to
judge”, “not more than one-tenth”, “one must be a bit
more cautious, gentlemen!” He is just like Turgenev’s ardent hero who ran away
from Asya, and about whom Chernyshevsky wrote “A Russian at a
Rendezvous”.[4]


Oh, you, who call yourselves supporters of the toiling masses! It’s not for you
to go to a rendezvous with the revolution. Stay at home; really, it will be
quieter there; and you need have no dealings with these dangerous “most
energetic, lively and active people”. Stay-at-home philistines are more
your type!


Perhaps this simple example will help you to grasp the “centre of the
controversy” over agreements with the Cadets?


It is, my dear sir, that we want to shake up the philistine and make a citizen
of him. And to do that we must

    

compel him to choose between the philistine policy of the
Cadets who are prostrating themselves before the (pshaw! pshaw!)
“constitution”, and the revolutionary policy of the socialist
proletariat.


A “bloc of all the Left parties” means submerging the
“one tenth, the most energetic, lively and active people”, in the
mass of the apathetic, stolid and somnolent. It means subordinating
those who are willing to fight (and are capable of carrying the masses
with them at the decisive moment) to those who prefer to play the same
despicable game of loyalty that the Cadets played in the First Duma, and, like
the Cadet Lvov, prefer to haggle with Stolypin and basely go over to the latter.


The reaction is attacking us, it has already withdrawn a good third of what was
gained in October, and is threatening to withdraw the other two-thirds. But you
pose as men of law and order and defend yourselves by appealing to philistine
mentality: no attacks; no revolution; we are going into the Duma to legislate;
we confine ourselves to defence; we abide by the law!


When will you understand that to keep on the defensive is in itself an admission
of moral defeat? In fact, you are people who have suffered moral defeat. All you
are fit for is to vote for the Cadets.


“Compel the philistine to choose”, we said. Yes,
compel. No socialist party in the world could wrest the masses from the
influence of the liberal or radical bourgeois parties, which base themselves on
the mentality of the philistine, without giving them a jolt, without meeting
with some resistance, without taking the risk involved in the first
experiment to decide who is really defending liberty, we or the
Cadets?


If there is an agreement with the Cadets, the philistine has no need to
worry about this. The radical windbag politicians and Social-Democratic
opportunists have already thought the matter out for him at their rendezvous
with the Cadets. The philistine has shifted to the Left (not as a result of our
efforts, not as a result of our Party propaganda, but as a result of
Stolypin’s zeal)—that’s enough for us. And since he has shifted to the
Left, he will be for a “bloc of all the Lefts”! And it will be the
whole mass of philistines, not

    

merely the restive—pardon—active one-tenth of the people. We should
      adapt our meetings and our whole policy to suit the cowardly
      philistine—that is what a bloc with the Cadets means in
      practice.


But we said: We need not only leaflets and platforms, resolutions and speeches,
but we must carry out our whole policy, and election campaign in such a way as
to draw a sharp contrast between the cowardly philistine and the
staunch fighter. And this can be done only by contrasting two
different lists: the Cadet list and the Social-Democratic list. In the
metropolis, whose newspapers circulate all over Russia, where the headquarters
of all the political parties are located, which leads the country
ideologically and politically, it is a thousand times more important to give an
example, not of a policy of philistine equanimity, but of a policy worthy of the
October fighters who wrested a little freedom from the authorities, a policy
worthy of the proletariat.


Our talk about the necessity of recognising the mistakes of the
“peace-loving” Cadet Duma, and of taking a step for ward, will
remain idle talk unless we ourselves take a step forward in
combating the philistine Oblomov[5]

idea of “a bloc of all the Left
parties”. Our calls to go forward will ring false and will fail
to fire the hearts of the fighters among the people if we ourselves, the
“guides”, the “leaders”, mark time in the
capital in full view of all the peoples of Russia, arm in arm with these same
Cadets, on the basis of an “amicable” distribution of
seats, in friendly fashion, all together, all for the same cause, all for
liberty.... What is the use of reviving old quarrels? What harm if the Menshevik
Ivan Ivanovich did call the Cadet Ivan Nikiforovich a goose?[6]


“Not more than one-tenth of the voters go to meetings.”


Very well, Mr. Radical. We will take your word for it for once; we will concede
this point to you, because—because your argument is so clumsy.


One-tenth of the voters makes 13,000 out of 130,000 for the whole of
St. Petersburg. These 13,000, the most energetic, lively and active voters, are
more to the Left than the Cadets. Let us ask ourselves: Can anyone of sound mind
and judgement assert that the energetic people who attend meetings do not
lead a certain number of the less energetic, stay-at-home voters? Everyone
will realise that such an assertion

    

would be wrong; that in a city with a population of a million and a
half there are thousands of agencies and channels, apart from newspapers and
meetings, through which the mood of the advanced elements is communicated to the
masses. Everyone will understand—and all elections in all countries
confirm it—that every energetic voter who attends meetings is backed by
not one but several stay-at-home voters.


At the last elections, of the total of 150,000 voters in St. Petersburg, 60,000
went to the poll. Of these, about 40,000 voted for the Cadets, and about 20,000
in the whole of St. Petersburg voted for the Rights. We have heard from our
Mr. Radical himself, who does not wish to be an “optimist” (Heaven
forbid! our radicals want to be “steady respectable people”... like
the German radicals of the eighteen forties).... We have heard from him that the
Octobrists have become quiescent, and we know from facts of their utter
defeat. Now we hear of 13,000 energetic voters who are more to the Left than the
Cadets. Remember that this proportion varies considerably in the different
districts. Remember the number of votes that are usually behind every voter who
goes to meetings.


It will be clear to you then that the danger of a Black-Hundred vote in
St. Petersburg, meaning the danger of the Rights being elected to the Duma as a
result of a split in the Cadet and socialist vote, is a preposterous
fable. For the Rights to be elected to the Duma in St. Petersburg, the
votes in the majority of the districts would not merely have to be
split, but split in such a way that both the Cadets and the
socialists would each have fewer votes than the Black-Hundred list. That is an
obvious absurdity.


Therefore, we say plainly: if the Black-Hundred danger does not manifest itself
in violations of the “constitution” (and it is the estimate
of this prospect that is the crux of the difference between the tactics
of the Cadets and that of the socialists), then a split in the Cadet and
socialist vote cannot possibly result in a victory for the Rights in
St. Peters burg.


The cry about the danger of a Black-Hundred victory in the elections in
St. Petersburg is a deception of the people spread by the Cadets, the
“radicals” and the opportunists

    

of every brand, and serves the interests of philistinism in
    politics. In practice, the fable about this Black-Hundred
    danger is in the interests of the Cadets, whom it helps to protect against
    the danger from the Left. It serves to dull the senses of
    the masses, for it does not require them, when they cast their vote, to
    distinguish between the “legislating” bourgeois Cadet and the
    socialist who is leading the people into battle.


Therefore, when the general chorus of liberals, Trudoviks and opportunist
Social-Democrats howl at us: You are isolated!—we answer calmly: We are
very glad to have isolated ourselves from a fraud. We are very glad to have
isolated ourselves from a dirty business. For to come before a mass of 130,000
voters in St. Petersburg, after January 9, 1905, and after October 1905, in
order to help to elect Kutler, Nabokov, Struve & Co. to the Duma is
certainly a dirty business.


We predict to the Trudoviks and to the opportunist Social-Democrats who are
rejoicing in anticipation that the Cadets will get them and not the Bolsheviks
into the Duma— we predict that if the Second Duma is a Cadet Duma, the
Trudoviks and opportunist Social-Democrats will be ashamed of having
helped to elect the Cadets. They will now be directly responsible for
it. And the Cadets in the Second Duma will move so far to the right (this is
evident from their general behaviour and from all the political literature they
have issued during the past year) that even the extreme opportunists will be
obliged to expose them. In the First Duma, the Cadet Lvov went over to the
Peaceful Renovators and justified the Black-Hundred dissolution of the Duma. In
the Second Duma (unless history brings us a radical change that will wipe out
all petty deals with the Cadets, and all the Cadets themselves), in the Second
Duma the Cadets of the Lvov type will show their true colours not at the end,
but at the beginning.


Well then, gentlemen, take the seats in the Duma that the Cadets are offering
you! We do not envy you. We shall undertake to warn the mass of the workers and
of the petty bourgeoisie in the capital. We shall undertake to make them
realise—not only by speeches, but also by means of the elections
themselves—the gulf that divides the Cadets from the

 

Every man to his trade—though “there are hosts of people who would
like to mix these two trades, we are not of their number.”[7]


“And they,” says the leading article in Rodnaya Zemlya, speaking
of the Bolsheviks, “will now be even more isolated than ever; for those
former boycottists, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, are now not only taking part
in the elections, but are even in favour of a bloc with the Cadets.”


This is new and interesting. We have already observed, on a former occasion,
that on this question of electoral agreements the Socialist-Revolutionaries are
not behaving like a political party, but like an intellectualist clique, for we
heard of no open political action of their organisations on this
question. And now, assuming that the newspaper for which Mr. Tan writes is not
telling a down right lie and is not repeating an unverified rumour, we shall
draw this further conclusion—namely: in the matter of electoral agreements
the Socialist-Revolutionaries are guilty of political dishonesty, or,
at any rate, are displaying vacillation that amounts to a political danger.


Everyone knows that the Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic
organisation rejected a bloc with the Cadets and offered to enter into an
electoral agreement with the Trudoviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries against
the Cadets. Our resolution was published in all the newspapers.


Negotiations between the St. Petersburg Committee of
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and the appropriate bodies of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group have
already taken place. Differences arose over our exclusion of the Popular
Socialists and over the distribution of seats. If, nevertheless, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who began negotiations with us
after we had declared that we had definitely decided to give battle to
the Cadets in St. Petersburg, have begun, or are continuing,
negotiations with the Cadets for a bloc, then obviously, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries are guilty of political dishonesty.


We openly declare: We are going to fight the Cadets. Who is on our
side?


But the Socialist-Revolutionaries are negotiating both with us
and with the Cadets!

 

We repeat: We do not know whether the leading article in Rodnaya Zemlya
    told the truth or not. We cannot altogether ignore a direct statement made
    by an organ to which Mr. Tan, a member of the Organising Committee of the
    Popular Socialist Party, is a contributor. We have learned about the bloc
    between the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Popular Socialists from the
    press and from the communications made by the Socialist-Revolutionaries in
    their negotiations with us (although we are ignorant of the terms of this
    bloc and of its real nature; in this connection also something is going on
    behind the scenes).


Our duty, therefore, is to raise this question publicly and openly, so that
all may know of the behaviour of a certain political party. Hitherto,
in this country, the alignment of parties has been determined only by their
programmes and literature—but these, after all, are only words. The First
Duma provided an opportunity of judging some parties by their
actions. Now we must make use of the elections, too, and we
shall use them for fully enlightening the masses as to the real nature
of the parties.


That the Socialist-Revolutionaries are hiding something in their
relations with the Popular Socialists is now a political fact. That the
Socialist-Revolutionaries are now actually trailing in the wake of the
opportunist party that has split off from them is also a fact. Hence, in regard
to revolutionary independence and determination the Socialist-Revolutionaries
are really much worse than they seem to be. And if they agree to enter into a
bloc with the Cadets— and to gain a seat not for themselves, but for the
Popular Socialists—we shall have excellent agitational material with
which to explain to the workers of St. Petersburg the Marxist thesis of the
utter instability and deceptive exterior of the petty-bourgeois (even if
revolutionary) parties.


We not only think that it is a matter of honour for a Social-Democrat to
“isolate” himself from such parties, but we think it is the
only well-calculated policy to pursue. But our calculation is made not from the
point of view of seats in the Duma, but from the point of view of the working-
class movement as a whole, from the point of view of the fundamental
interests of socialism.

 

But let us return to Rodnaya Zemlya. The following

pas sage 

shows how frivolous that newspaper can be.




“Generally speaking, the decisions of the Bolshevik Conference appear to
have been adopted hastily and rashly. After all, in what respect are

t.he 

Trudoviks better than the Popular Socialists?”




This “after all” is a real gem. The author is such an ignoramus in
politics that he does not even realise that he is walking about naked, like an
Australian savage. And these are the educated politicians of the petty
bourgeoisie!


Well, there is nothing for it but to perform the “thankless task” of
the publicist: to go over old ground and teach the
ABC.


The Trudoviks, i. e., the Committee of the Trudovik Group, which was
approached by the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic Conference, and the Popular
Socialists, originated from the Trudovik Group in the First Duma. This Trudovik
Group had two wings: one opportunist, the other revolutionary. The difference
between them was most clearly revealed in the two Land Bills introduced
by the Trudovik Group: the Bill of the 104, and the Bill of the 33.


Common to both Bills is that

(1) they are in favour of transferring the land
from the landlords to the peasants;

(2) they are thoroughly permeated
with the spirit of petty-bourgeois utopianism., the utopia of
“equalising” small proprietors (in some respects, at least) in a
society based on commodity production.


The difference between these Bills is that the first is permeated with the
small proprietor’s fear of being too radical, of drawing too large a
mass of poor people into the movement. This “spirit” of the Bill of
the 104 was admirably expressed by one of its authors, one of the leaders of
the Popular Socialists, Mr. Peshekhonov, in referring to the declaration of the
“thrifty muzhiks” in the Duma: “We were sent here to get land,
not to give it up.” This means that in addition to the utopia of petty-bourgeois
equalitarianism this wing of the Trudoviks clearly expresses the
selfish interests of the more well-to-do section of the
peasantry, who are afraid lest they might have to “give up”
something (on the assumption that there will be general
“equalisation”, as socialism is conceived by the petty
bourgeois). Take from the

    

landlord, but give nothing to the proletarian, such is the motto of the party
      of the thrifty muzhiks.


On the other hand, the Bill of the 33 proposes the immediate and complete
abolition of private property in land. It also contains the
“equalitarian” utopia, and to the same degree, but it does not
express the fear of having to “give up”. This is the utopia, not of
the opportunist but of the revolutionary petty bourgeois; not of the thrifty
muzhik, but of the ruined muzhik. It is not a dream of profiting from the
landlord to the detriment of the proletarian, it is a dream of making everybody,
including the proletarians, happy by equalisation. It expresses, not the fear of
drawing the broadest and poorest masses into the movement, but the desire to
draw them into the struggle (the desire is there, but the ability or
understanding how to do so is

      lacking).[1]


After the Duma this difference in the two trends among the Trudoviks led to the
formation of two distinct political organisations: the Committee of the Trudovik
Group, and the Popular Socialist Party. The former has earned an honourable
place in the history of the Russian revolution by its July manifestoes. So far
as public knowledge goes, it has not yet forfeited its good reputation, has
never renounced its manifestoes or joined the chorus of moaners, grousers and
renegades.


The second organisation took advantage of the period of the dissolution of the
Duma to legalise itself under the Stolypin regime, to “berate” the
above-mentioned manifestoes in the legal press, where it was shielded from
criticism from the Left, to advise the people “for the time being”
not to come into conflict with certain institutions of the old regime, and so
forth. The Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation was,
if anything, rather mild in its criticism of this party when it spoke of its
“evasive position on the fundamental questions of the struggle outside the
Duma”.


Thus, the political facts so far are that the petty-bourgeois or
Trudovik parties have clearly split into the parties of

    

the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie (the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
Committee of the Trudovik Group) and a party of the opportunist petty
bourgeoisie (the Popular Socialists). Since for Social-Democrats the election
campaign is a means for politically educating the masses, here too, by
distinguishing two Trudovik parties from a third, we have compelled the
ordinary man in the street to ponder over the reasons for this
distinction. And after thinking it out and realising what it is all about he
will make an intelligent choice.


In conclusion we must note that the naïve and ignorant leader-writer of
Rodnaya Zemlya indulges also in amusing sophistries to support his
case. It would not be amiss to analyse one of these sophistries, which is of a
kind that just suits philistines:


“The Bolsheviks are wrong even if there is no Black-Hundred danger. For,
in that case, there is no need for a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
the Trudoviks, and the Socialist-Democratic Party could with great benefit to
the purity of its class content come out in the elections quite independently.”


See what clever fellows we are, thinks this radical—we can even judge of
the purity of class content!


Yes, the modern newspaper hack “can” make judgements about anything,
but he lacks knowledge and understanding. It is not true to say that the need to
preserve the purity of a class position precludes all agreements. To think so is
to reduce the ideas of Marxism to absurdity, to make a caricature of them. And
it is equally untrue to say that there is no need for a bloc with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries if there is no Black-Hundred danger.


Complete independence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party in the election
campaign is the general rule. But every live, mass party must allow certain
exceptions, but only within reasonable and strictly defined limits. In the epoch
of the bourgeois revolution all Social-Democrats sanctioned political
agreements with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, when they worked
together in the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Soldiers’, Railwaymen’s, etc.,
Deputies, and when they signed the famous manifesto of the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies (December 1905) or the July manifestoes (July

    

1906). The leader-writer of Rodnaya Zemlya is evidently ignorant of
     the most generally known facts about the parts played by the various
     parties in the Russian revolution. The revolutionary Social-Democrats
     reject unprincipled agreements, they reject harmful and unnecessary
     agreements, but they would never think of tying their hands altogether and
     under all circumstances. That would be childish. The platform of the 14
     delegates at the All-Russian Social-Democratic Conference is documentary
     proof of that.


To proceed. The “necessity” of an agreement with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks in St. Petersburg arises from the
Cadet danger. Had the author of the leading article in Rodnaya
Zemlya been familiar with the subject which he undertook to discuss, he
would have known that even among the Social-Democrats who support agreements
with the Cadets there are highly influential bodies (the Bund, for example)
which recognise the need for a bloc with the revolutionary bourgeoisie in case
of a Cadet danger, when there is no Black-Hundred danger. In St. Petersburg, it
would be possible not only to conduct an election campaign in the spirit of
revolutionary and socialist education of the masses (we Social-Democrats will
achieve this in any case), but to defeat the Cadets, if the Menshevik
Social-Democrats did not betray us, and if all the revolutionary
Trudoviks followed all the socialists. And since we are conducting an
election campaign, we have no right to miss any opportunity of achieving
victory, as long as there is no violation of the principles of socialist
tactics.


That the only important fight being waged in St. Petersburg is that
between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats is proved by the election
meetings (the same holds good for Moscow, and we may add that the results of
all straw votes, such as that instituted by the newspaper Vek,
or by the Shop Assistants’ Union “Unity and Strength”, have also
confirmed this thesis).[8]


That an agreement with the Cadets means the ideological and political hegemony
of the Cadets over their allies is borne out by the whole political press and by
the whole character of the negotiations. The Cadets dictate the terms. The
Cadets publicly lay down the significance of the agreements (recall
their comments on the Mensheviks and the Popular

    

Socialists: “the moderate socialist parties”, “the
opposition bloc”). The Cadets are asked to agree to an equal
distribution of seats as a maximum concession.


It is equally beyond doubt that an agreement between the Social-Democrats and
the revolutionary-democratic parties means the hegemony of the Social-Democrats
over the petty bourgeoisie. The Social-Democratic press has given an open, clear
and all-round exposition of all its views, whereas the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group have made no
independent statement whatever on the question of agreements. The keynote is set
by the Social-Democrats. The modification of their socialist views, of their
class standpoint, is quite out of the question. When it comes to distributing
the seats no one will think of offering them the smaller share. Their campaign
in the workers’ curia is proceeding quite independently, and is proving their
preponderance.


Under such circumstances it would be simply absurd to be afraid to lead our
revolutionary petty-bourgeois allies into battle against the Cadets. Under such
circumstances we could even draw the Popular Socialists with us if the occasion
required it. The principles of our Party would not suffer from this in the
least: the political line would remain the same and the struggle against the
leading party of the liberal-bourgeois conciliators would be waged with no less
vigour. No sensible person would say that we were following the Popular
Socialists (in conceding to them, together with the Socialist-Revolutionaries
and the Committee of the Trudovik Group, two seats out of six). On the contrary,
it would be proof that the Social-Democrats were conducting a really
independent campaign, and that we had deprived the Cadets of one of
their appendages. Is it not obvious that if the semi-Cadets came on our list,
their mobilisation against the Cadets would not merely not prejudice, but would,
on the contrary, facilitate the task of fighting the latter?


The Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation acted
rightly in declaring openly and publicly its hostility towards the
Popular Socialists. It was our duty to warn the revolutionary Trudoviks against
such a pseudo-Trudovik party. If the revolutionary Trudoviks are

    

dependent on the Popular Socialist Party, which is formally an
    entirely independent party, let them say so publicly. It is most important
    for us to drag this fact into the light of day, to make them admit it, and
    to draw all the conclusions that follow from it in our agitation
    among the mass of the workers, among the whole people.


Whether we get Trudoviks of a better or worse quality as our allies in the fight
against the Cadets in St. Petersburg, is a question that we shall decide in a
purely practical way.
We have formulated our principles. In any case we shall go into
the fight independently. We have openly disclaimed
responsibility for the least reliable Trudoviks and placed this responsibility
on others.

 *     *  * 

The Left Cadets on Tovarishch tried to ridicule the Bolsheviks when
the latter declared, as early as November, that three main parties were
contending against each other in St. Petersburg: the Black Hundreds, the Cadets,
and the Social-Democrats.


Rira bien qui rira le dernier (he who laughs last laughs best).


Our forecast has been proved correct.


There will be three lists for the Duma elections in St. Petersburg:
the Black-Hundred, the Cadet and the Social-Democratic.


Citizens, make your choice!
